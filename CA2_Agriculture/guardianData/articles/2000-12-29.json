The programmes from India will cover the convergence of millions of Hindus for the purification festival of Kumbh Mela, which takes place on the banks of the sacred river Ganges at Allahabad only once every 12 years. This time the festival is expected to attract what might be the largest crowd ever recorded. Up to 70m people are expected to bathe in the river during the four weeks of the festival, with as many as 25m attending on the main day, January 24. The crowd, gathering from Hindu communities all over the world - many from India will have walked or even crawled hundreds of miles to get there - will easily dwarf any other religious gathering anywhere in the world. Just one of the five leading sadhus - holy men - planning to attend claims the allegiance of 200m Hindus, equivalent to a fifth of adherents of the entire Roman Catholic church. Pilgrims view the occasion as an opportunity to meet old friends, listen to their gurus preach and join them in the river as an act of purification and renewal. Although there are three other sites across India, Allahabad is the most important as the Ganges, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers all converge there at a site seen as the confluence between heaven and earth. The Indian government authorities have mounted an enormous logistical exercise to accommodate the crowds, building a tent city said to be capable of housing twice as many people as the population of London, setting up 12 hospitals, constructing 14 enormous pontoon bridges to enable the crowds to reach the water and bussing in 18,000 traffic police. It has allocated the equivalent of \u00a32m to the project - a drop in the river compared with the amount the British government spent on the Millenium Dome, but still a major effort. In a documentary to be broadcast on Channel 4, the police officer in charge, Alex Sharma, said: \"It is the biggest task on earth, the biggest task any policeman could perform, being part of bringing these people to a higher plain. This is much bigger than any police district in India.\" Police officers assigned to crowd control have been exercising at the site for months to accustom themselves to the location and to newly installed satellite computer technology to enable lost children to be reunited with their parents. That is highly necessary - during the last Kumbh in 1989, 3,000 people disappeared, 252 of them children who have never been seen again by their parents. It is thought some might have been kidnapped and auctioned off to labour contractors to work in city sweatshops. Many of the disappeared could not be traced because they did not know either their own full names or the name of their home village. This time the satellite links will beam their photographs to all meeting points across the site. The authorities are also hoping there will not be a similar tragedy to 1954 when 300 people were crushed to death in the rush to the river bank. Channel 4 is broadcasting a one hour documentary on January 7 followed by nightly reports lasting 10 minutes throughout the four weeks of the festival.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of young British Muslims have fought for religious causes around the world, an Islamic leader claimed yesterday, following reports naming a student from Birmingham as the suicide bomber who killed eight people in Kashmir on Christmas Day. Kashmiri guerrilla fighters Jaish-e-Mohammed named the bomber as Bilal Ahmed, 24, and said that he had packed a stolen car with explosives before blowing himself up outside an Indian army barracks in Srinagar. The attack - which killed up to six Indian soldiers and three Kashmiri students returning home to celebrate a Muslim holiday - was one of a series intended to derail a ceasefire announced by India during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The Foreign Office has not confirmed the bomber's identity and doubt even surrounds his name, which has also been given as Mohammed Bilal or Abdullah Bai, the latter thought to be a nom de guerre. Jaish-e-Mohammed, which means Mohammed's army, is one of the newest and most active splinter groups opposed to Indian rule in predominantly-Muslim Kashmir, a burning issue not only for residents but also for Kashmiri immigrants and their children in Britain. Jaish claims that Bilal was born into a Pakistani family in Birmingham and was a \"nightclub-going lad\" until he became a born-again Muslim at 18 after seeing the Prophet Mohammed in a dream. Birmingham is a focal point for such recruitment; it was home to three of the eight Britons jailed in Yemen in 1998 over a terrorist bomb plot, while a 24-year-old Muslim convert from Birmingham was reportedly killed in a US missile attack on Osama Bin Laden's Afghanistan base. A striking illustration of the potency of this issue in Britain's second city came during last summer's local elections, when a party called Justice for Kashmir increased its representation to five council seats, making it the fourth largest party group on an extraordinary single-issue platform. Mohammed Ghalib, president of Birmingham-based lobby group Tehreek-e-Kashmir UK said of the suicide bomber: \"The story will encourage the youth that this is a good thing and may encourage them to become more militant. If you call them terrorists then they'll become terrorists. If Indian army soldiers died in a bomb attack then most people here wouldn't mind.\" Sheikh Omar Bakri-Mohammed, founder of London-based Islamic group Al-Muhajiroun, claimed yesterday that around 1,800 British Muslims take part in \"military service\" each year, recruited at mosques and university campuses across the country. The Syrian-born cleric said the recruits were often undergraduates suffering from an identity crisis who were persuaded to rediscover their parents' faith and encouraged to fight against infidel \"occupying forces\" in Kashmir, Palestine and Chechnya. Sacrifice \"People who go from here and sacrifice themselves to Almighty God as human bombs will achieve martyrdom, and they will go to paradise,\" he said at a north London office he rents under a bogus business name. \"The enemy who dies will go to hell-fire.\" The British authorities admit they do not know how many British Muslims go abroad to fight with terrorist groups. A Home Office spokesman pointed out: \"When someone is leaving the country they do not say at customs they are going to be a terrorist, they say they are going on holiday.\" However, changes to anti-terrorism laws could be used by the courts to prosecute British-based extremists. At the moment, if extremist groups do not break any British laws, they are left free to continue fundraising, recruiting and training. But when the Terrorism Act 2000 comes into force in February, groups can be banned, their assets confiscated and their members jailed if it can be proved they conspired to commit a terrorist offence abroad. Labour MP David Winnick, a member of the home affairs select committee, said he understood the passions that issues such as Kashmir could provoke, but urged that the legislation be used to crack down on terrorists. \"I take the view that Britain should not under any circumstances be a safe haven for any sort of terrorist activities. \"While I believe a person has a right to put forward a point of view, I draw the line at actively promoting activities that could be described as terrorism.\" Amir Khan, a spokesman for Birmingham's Justice for Kashmir party, expressed scepticism about claims that the bomber was from the city as no family members had come forward to ask for a funeral service at the mosque. \"The Kashmiri community is very closely linked. We haven't heard anyone saying that anyone from Birmingham has been killed in Kashmir.\" But he warned that his party had robbed Labour of safe seats at council elections because of strong feeling over the divided Himalayan state. \"It's a war going on between the Indian army and Kashmiris. There is a very strong feeling. Because of the modern media you can turn on CNN and see how many people died today. I and others left the Labour party because they are...hypocritical on Kashmir. People's roots are in the area and we believe the only way we can settle this issue is [through] ourselves. \"Roger Godsiff, the MP for Small Heath, hasn't done anything on Kashmir despite the promises he made before the election when he was campaigning in the balti houses. \"People feel strongly for their brothers and sisters in Kashmir.\" Originally, the Justice for Kashmir party had campaigned for the home secretary to review the sentences passed on two Kashmiris involved in an assassination attempt, as well as the broader issue of the war-ravaged province. The group has now renamed itself the Justice party as a means of widening its appeal to inner-city areas and ethnic minorities generally. Joblessness in the Kashmiri community was very high, Mr Khan added, saying that the 10 poorest council wards in Birmingham were home to the Kashmiri community. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since 1947. More than 30,000 people have died in the past 12 years in a Kashmir independence campaign . Militant Hackney to Kashmir Mohammed Omar, 25, a British-born Muslim who has trained with guerrilla fighters in Pakistan, said that many young Muslims who had thought themselves westernised were shaken by the Gulf war. He claimed to have fought in Kashmir with the splinter group Jaish-e-Mohammed, which is said to have recruited the Birmingham suicide bomber. \"During the Gulf war a lot of Muslim people, who until then had been quite content, thought 'Hold on a minute - there is a large Muslim population in Iraq which is under attack by the same country that we are supposed to be a part of. What's my role in all this?' \"A lot of people like myself wondered what was my identity. Am I black? Am I Asian? \"I grew up in Hackney, where a lot of people said OK I'm black. I think it was a lot to do with peer group pressure because in Hackney there were a lot of people from Jamaica. There's nothing wrong with that, but in the end it's just a fashion statement. \"In 1992 or 1993, I saw Hizb ut-Tahrir [a radical Islamic group later banned from campuses] debating at Soas [London University's School of Oriental and African Studies] with intellectuals, like deans, who quite frankly got trashed by them. \"They seemed to provide a solution. \"I had an opportunity to travel around to different parts of the Muslim world. I went to Turkey and saw the world in a different light. \"What I saw inside Turkey was that if you were Muslim you were considered backward and the government would come down on you. \"I went to the Middle East and got arrested a couple of times just because I was speaking about Islam. \"I trained with the mujahedin in Pakistan, where there is assistance from some elements of the army. The training is not just physical but involves the mind as well. Every day I read the Koran. \"There was an immense amount of physical training. There were daily runs. There were assault courses. I was trained in the use of light arms, Kalashnikovs. Other guys were trained to use rocket launchers. \"We believe that fighting for the sake of Allah is one of the most rewarding things in life. If it is done sincerely, and you die, you will go to paradise. \"In a typical operation a couple of months ago, four mujahedin climbed into a military camp of the Hindus [Indian army] and fought and killed as many as they could before becoming shahid [martyrs]. \"A lot of those men are not married. They are young single guys. I have got a wife. But this is not a time when I can go picnicking with my wife. It's a time of crisis for Muslims.\"",

As it happens, this movie is something of a family effort, the script being co-written by her father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, who also edits.

A group of men trudge wearily but uncomplainingly up the fierce slopes, each carrying a blackboard. They are itinerant teachers searching for a village with children to teach - a curious comic invention Makhmalbaf makes effortlessly persuasive. The men look like strange crows with their great black rectangles across their shoulders, and together make a spectacle which is like an art installation. </p> <p>Soon, the picture singles out two of the men, who peel off from the main group and then part company themselves, in search of professional good fortune. One blocks the path of a group of boys who are making their laborious way along the path, bowed down by burdens of their own - they are mules carrying contraband for an unseen master. The second finds himself taken up by a nomadic group looking for the way to the border so that they can find their homeland; they too are dustily sweating under their burdens, and the teacher ingratiates himself with them by promising to show them the way, in return for a bag of walnuts, and also by allowing a sick old man to be carried on his board. </p> <p>What is so striking about Blackboards is Makhmalbaf's unmediated access to a kind of timeless past: not to an innocence exactly, but to a culture stripped of all the encumbrances of modernity. There is, at one stage, the off-camera sound of a helicopter and later, the nomads run terrified from what they think is a chemical weapons attack but turns out to be simply rifle fire. These two events aside - and even they are never shown on screen - we could be witnessing something happening any time in the last millennium. </p> <p>The teachers here are like troubadours, or shepherds, with no more status than anyone else on the mountain. Their simple quest for pupils, with no qualifications other than the heavy blackboard, seems to show a naivety hardly more clouded than the children they meet. Everywhere they proselytise for literacy, so that the children can read a book - or better yet, a newspaper, so that you can find out what is going on in the world. But everyone they meet seems already to know far more about what is going on in the world than the teachers. </p> <p>In its stoic acceptance of chance encounters and random events, Blackboards offers us a ludic innocence and a child-like seriousness, in which Makhmalbaf shows herself as having something of a Lewis Carroll sensibility - yet what she inhabits here is not Wonderland, but the grim political world of Kurdistan, in which the questions of genocide and indeed our own uncertain western intervention rumble faintly beyond the mountain horizon. </p> <p>Blackboards once more shows the clarity and grace of the new Iranian cinema, which seems to show a specific aptitude for the experience of children. Whether or not this is a reflex learned in order to circumvent censorship, it really does demonstrate a certain charm and innocence, which has too much technique to be called primitive, and of which Anglophone cinema seems more or less incapable. </p>",

      "body": "<p>It's all over bar the booing. On Sunday evening at 6pm, staff at the Millennium Dome will turn off the lights, lock the doors, and leave the place for the last time.</p> <p>Some may stay on site to rave in the new year at a party run by the Ministry of Sound club outfit, but that will be centred on the so-called baby dome.</p> <p>The big one, the jumbo-dumbo dome, will finally go dark.</p> <p>It has been an extraordinary year for the great white elephant by the Thames. It has gobbled up 6.5m visitors and around a billion pounds. It has been knocked by the media, castigated by politicians, praised by punters, rocked by resignation, and hit by diamond robbers.</p> <p>Now it will be eviscerated to make way for a new high-tech existence, while property developers dream of new riches they will make from luxury housing in the shadow of the beast.</p> <p>Here are just some of the lows and slightly less-lows of the Year of the dome:</p> <p><b>December 31, 1999</b></p> <p>Conceived by the Major government, the dome was given life by New Labour. It was a messy birth, with flocks of editors and lesser celebs being made to hang around in the cold for security clearance. The subsequent torrent of knocking copy was followed by a smaller stream of pieces saying that actually, it was all rather fun - but the damage was done.</p> <p><b>January 2000</b></p> <p>Having run through its original Lottery grant of \u00a3400m, and an additional Lottery Commission loan of \u00a350m, the dome gets yet another grant of \u00a360m.</p> <p><b>February</b></p> <p>dome chief executive Jennie Page is sacked. Her successor, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, quickly wins fame for his irrepressible optimism. Indeed, he resembles one of the cheery anthropomorphic cartoon characters he used to help manage at Disneyland Paris.</p> <p><b>March</b></p> <p>Visitor figures are now running well below the fabulously inflated target for the year of 12m, and the scarcely less ridiculous revised target of 10m.</p> <p><b>May</b></p> <p>Gerbeau goes cap in hand to the Lottery Commission for another cash injection. Bob Ayling, former British Airways boss and chairman of the New Millennium Experience Company, is forced to resign as a condition of the latest \u00a329m bung. The NMEC says it will need no more cash injections.</p> <p><b>July</b></p> <p>Nomura International, the Japanese venture capital outfit, beats off five other rival bidders to win the right to buy the dome in 2001, for \u00a3106m. It talks excitedly of creating an \"urban entertainment resort.\"</p> <p><b>July</b></p> <p>Politicians and managers involved in the Greenwich project are lambasted in a parliamentary select committee report.</p> <p><b>September</b></p> <p>The NMEC gets \u00a347m more from the Lottery Commission, to keep the dome open to the end of the year. By now visitor projections are down to 4.5m.</p> <p>Nomura has second thoughts. It pulls out of its dome deal, saying that the figures no longer stack up and that it never signed a binding contract anyway.</p> <p><b>November</b></p> <p>The government offers 'preferred bidder' status to another investment outfit, Legacy, run by Robert Bourne but owned by controversial Irish developers John Ronan and Richard Barrett. By pure coincidence, Bourne is a fervent - and generous - New Labour supporter. Legacy wants to turn the dome into a high-tech enterprise zone called Knowledge City.</p> <p>The National Audit Office issues a scathing report on the dome. It criticises \"weaknesses in financial management and control\" at the New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the dome. It says that visitor number targets were \"ambitious and inherently risky\".

      "bodyText": "It's all over bar the booing. On Sunday evening at 6pm, staff at the Millennium Dome will turn off the lights, lock the doors, and leave the place for the last time. Some may stay on site to rave in the new year at a party run by the Ministry of Sound club outfit, but that will be centred on the so-called baby dome. The big one, the jumbo-dumbo dome, will finally go dark. It has been an extraordinary year for the great white elephant by the Thames. It has gobbled up 6.5m visitors and around a billion pounds. It has been knocked by the media, castigated by politicians, praised by punters, rocked by resignation, and hit by diamond robbers. Now it will be eviscerated to make way for a new high-tech existence, while property developers dream of new riches they will make from luxury housing in the shadow of the beast. Here are just some of the lows and slightly less-lows of the Year of the dome: December 31, 1999 Conceived by the Major government, the dome was given life by New Labour. It was a messy birth, with flocks of editors and lesser celebs being made to hang around in the cold for security clearance. The subsequent torrent of knocking copy was followed by a smaller stream of pieces saying that actually, it was all rather fun - but the damage was done. January 2000 Having run through its original Lottery grant of \u00a3400m, and an additional Lottery Commission loan of \u00a350m, the dome gets yet another grant of \u00a360m. February dome chief executive Jennie Page is sacked. Her successor, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, quickly wins fame for his irrepressible optimism. Indeed, he resembles one of the cheery anthropomorphic cartoon characters he used to help manage at Disneyland Paris. March Visitor figures are now running well below the fabulously inflated target for the year of 12m, and the scarcely less ridiculous revised target of 10m. May Gerbeau goes cap in hand to the Lottery Commission for another cash injection. Bob Ayling, former British Airways boss and chairman of the New Millennium Experience Company, is forced to resign as a condition of the latest \u00a329m bung. The NMEC says it will need no more cash injections. July Nomura International, the Japanese venture capital outfit, beats off five other rival bidders to win the right to buy the dome in 2001, for \u00a3106m. It talks excitedly of creating an \"urban entertainment resort.\" July Politicians and managers involved in the Greenwich project are lambasted in a parliamentary select committee report. September The NMEC gets \u00a347m more from the Lottery Commission, to keep the dome open to the end of the year. By now visitor projections are down to 4.5m. Nomura has second thoughts. It pulls out of its dome deal, saying that the figures no longer stack up and that it never signed a binding contract anyway. November The government offers 'preferred bidder' status to another investment outfit, Legacy, run by Robert Bourne but owned by controversial Irish developers John Ronan and Richard Barrett. By pure coincidence, Bourne is a fervent - and generous - New Labour supporter. Legacy wants to turn the dome into a high-tech enterprise zone called Knowledge City. The National Audit Office issues a scathing report on the dome. It criticises \"weaknesses in financial management and control\" at the New Millennium Experience Company, which runs the dome. It says that visitor number targets were \"ambitious and inherently risky\". The NAO also announces a new inquiry into the \u00a3125m sale of the dome to Legacy. A gang of would-be diamond thieves are ambushed and captured by police, who had been tipped off about their daring plan to break into the dome and steal the De Beers exhibition, said to be worth up to \u00a3250m. December Greenwhich council confirms that it is in discussions with Legacy about the development of around 1000 upmarket homes on part of the site fronting the Thames. The houses could be worth up to \u00a31m each. A last minute rush by visitors anxious to see the dome while it still lasts, lifts the annual total to around 6.5m. There is even talk of some money being paid back to the Lottery Commission.

      "byline": "Brian Whitaker",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Inuit people of Alaska and Greenland are said to have several hundred words for different types of snow. The Arabs, in turn, have lots of words for camels and dates, but when it comes to snow they have only one word - \"thalj\".</p> <p>As far as the Arabic language is concerned, there's no distinction between snow and ice, so the same word does for both. With small modifications the word covers almost anything associated with freezing - from refrigerators to icebergs.</p> <p>Earlier this week I was in the chilly north of England, visiting relatives for Christmas. With a wind blowing from the Arctic, it was the usual story of slippery roads, cars that wouldn't start and frozen points on the railway lines.</p> <p>\"Don't you wish you were back in the Middle East?\" people would say. Well, yes, but the Middle East can be cold in winter, too.</p> <p>Last winter snow fell in Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, and even Saudi Arabia. In Jerusalem the falls were particularly heavy, reaching a depth of 30 centimetres.</p> <p>The dryness of the region generally limits the amount of snow, but I have seen (and felt) frost even in Yemen, at the southern end of the Arabian peninsula.</p> <p>Normally-invisible drops of moisture in the atmosphere condense and freeze, making the ground glisten in the early morning.</p> <p>This is not the sort of weather most people expect in the Middle East, and the region as a whole is unprepared for it. The cold spells may be shorter and less intense than those in northern Europe and America, but keeping warm is a much bigger problem.</p> <p>I learned this the hard way a few years ago when, in rebellion against the traditional British Christmas, I went to Tunisia on a trip which included a camel trek and an overnight stay in the desert.</p> <p>The hotel in Tozeur, where I spent the first night, had - contrary to my expectations - done its best to appear Christmassy. In the absence of fir trees it had used the next best thing: a five-foot tall shisha (hubble-bubble pipe) decorated with tinsel and baubles. It had not, however, gone to the expense of installing a heating system.</p> <p>Once the sun went down, the only way to keep warm was to walk the streets (there were two of them, and not very long) until bedtime.</p> <p>The journey to the trekking centre was in a van with holes in the floor, some of which were large enough to watch the road whizzing past underneath. These provided a very effective cooling system which I'm sure would have been most welcome in summer.</p> <p>Four other people booked on the trek abandoned it at lunchtime, leaving me, one camel and its owner, Ahmed, to plod on over the dunes. The desert strips life to its bare essentials, which at this time of year means a fire for cooking, light and warmth after nightfall.</p> <p>Fuel in the desert is scarce and impossible to find after dark, so we started collecting it early in the afternoon - mostly twigs and light vegetation which burn all too quickly.</p> <p>We gathered enough fuel to cook a meal but by 7pm the embers had stopped glowing and there was nothing to do but sleep. Ahmed lay on the sand and pulled the hood of his burnous - the brown woollen cloak worn by Tunisians in winter - over his head and curled up his legs.</p> <p>Fully clothed, and with two blankets beneath me and three on top, I spent most of the night awake, shivering and trying to recall the warning signs of hypothermia. The cold seeped up from the ground and at the slightest movement the chilling wind found its way through gaps under the blankets.</p> <p>In the morning, Ahmed found some more twigs and rekindled the fire. Then he took off his boots and held his feet in the flames, removing them only when the steam rising from his socks turned to smoke.</p> <p>Foreigners in search of winter sun are not the only ones who can be taken by surprise. Last January's snowfalls were the heaviest for 50 years in some parts of the Middle East. At least nine people died and several houses collapsed because the roof was not strong enough to support the unexpected weight of snow.</p> <p>In Jordan, where steep hills and icy roads make a disastrous combination, the authorities reported 645 road accidents cased by the weather. In Iran, 150 people had to be rescued from snowbound cars near the Iraqi border.</p> <p>Heating in traditional Arab houses is either rudimentary or non-existent. The time-honoured method is to fill a large earthenware bowl with glowing charcoal and huddle round it.</p> <p>Others use portable gas heaters - often unaware that they give off dangerous fumes - and get poisoned as a result.</p> <p>But heavy snow is good for the Middle East's ski resorts. Yes, they do exist. There are half a dozen in Lebanon and another, run by the Israelis, in the occupied Golan Heights. For the really adventurous, there's also one in Iran.</p> <p>Morocco's largest ski resort, Oukaimeden, was originally built by the French. When conditions are good there are up to 20 km (13 miles) of runs, the longest one 3 km (nearly 2 miles) in length. Besides using the ski lifts, you can also get up to the top by donkey.</p> <p>It's a lot cheaper than the Alps, and generally uncrowded, but opinions of the skiing vary. Remember: whether the snow is powder, crust or slush, the Arabs have only one word for it.</p> <p>The point, according to one visitor, is not to find the best snow but to amaze your friends by telling them you've been skiing in Morocco.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:brian.whitaker@theguardian.com\"> brian.whitaker@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/0,2759,180403,00.html\">Iraq</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/yemen/0,2759,193338,00.html\">Yemen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/The_Kurds/0,2759,192981,00.html\">The Kurds</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28brian+whitaker%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=brian+whitaker&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Brian Whitaker</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.al-bab.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Al-bab.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.arabicnews.com/\" target=\"_new\">Arabic News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.middleeastwire.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East News Online</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.middleeastdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Middle East Daily</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Inuit people of Alaska and Greenland are said to have several hundred words for different types of snow. The Arabs, in turn, have lots of words for camels and dates, but when it comes to snow they have only one word - \"thalj\". As far as the Arabic language is concerned, there's no distinction between snow and ice, so the same word does for both. With small modifications the word covers almost anything associated with freezing - from refrigerators to icebergs. Earlier this week I was in the chilly north of England, visiting relatives for Christmas. With a wind blowing from the Arctic, it was the usual story of slippery roads, cars that wouldn't start and frozen points on the railway lines. \"Don't you wish you were back in the Middle East?\" people would say. Well, yes, but the Middle East can be cold in winter, too. Last winter snow fell in Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, and even Saudi Arabia. In Jerusalem the falls were particularly heavy, reaching a depth of 30 centimetres. The dryness of the region generally limits the amount of snow, but I have seen (and felt) frost even in Yemen, at the southern end of the Arabian peninsula. Normally-invisible drops of moisture in the atmosphere condense and freeze, making the ground glisten in the early morning. This is not the sort of weather most people expect in the Middle East, and the region as a whole is unprepared for it. The cold spells may be shorter and less intense than those in northern Europe and America, but keeping warm is a much bigger problem. I learned this the hard way a few years ago when, in rebellion against the traditional British Christmas, I went to Tunisia on a trip which included a camel trek and an overnight stay in the desert. The hotel in Tozeur, where I spent the first night, had - contrary to my expectations - done its best to appear Christmassy. In the absence of fir trees it had used the next best thing: a five-foot tall shisha (hubble-bubble pipe) decorated with tinsel and baubles. It had not, however, gone to the expense of installing a heating system. Once the sun went down, the only way to keep warm was to walk the streets (there were two of them, and not very long) until bedtime. The journey to the trekking centre was in a van with holes in the floor, some of which were large enough to watch the road whizzing past underneath. These provided a very effective cooling system which I'm sure would have been most welcome in summer. Four other people booked on the trek abandoned it at lunchtime, leaving me, one camel and its owner, Ahmed, to plod on over the dunes. The desert strips life to its bare essentials, which at this time of year means a fire for cooking, light and warmth after nightfall. Fuel in the desert is scarce and impossible to find after dark, so we started collecting it early in the afternoon - mostly twigs and light vegetation which burn all too quickly. We gathered enough fuel to cook a meal but by 7pm the embers had stopped glowing and there was nothing to do but sleep. Ahmed lay on the sand and pulled the hood of his burnous - the brown woollen cloak worn by Tunisians in winter - over his head and curled up his legs. Fully clothed, and with two blankets beneath me and three on top, I spent most of the night awake, shivering and trying to recall the warning signs of hypothermia. The cold seeped up from the ground and at the slightest movement the chilling wind found its way through gaps under the blankets. In the morning, Ahmed found some more twigs and rekindled the fire. Then he took off his boots and held his feet in the flames, removing them only when the steam rising from his socks turned to smoke. Foreigners in search of winter sun are not the only ones who can be taken by surprise. Last January's snowfalls were the heaviest for 50 years in some parts of the Middle East. At least nine people died and several houses collapsed because the roof was not strong enough to support the unexpected weight of snow. In Jordan, where steep hills and icy roads make a disastrous combination, the authorities reported 645 road accidents cased by the weather. In Iran, 150 people had to be rescued from snowbound cars near the Iraqi border. Heating in traditional Arab houses is either rudimentary or non-existent. The time-honoured method is to fill a large earthenware bowl with glowing charcoal and huddle round it. Others use portable gas heaters - often unaware that they give off dangerous fumes - and get poisoned as a result. But heavy snow is good for the Middle East's ski resorts. Yes, they do exist. There are half a dozen in Lebanon and another, run by the Israelis, in the occupied Golan Heights. For the really adventurous, there's also one in Iran. Morocco's largest ski resort, Oukaimeden, was originally built by the French. When conditions are good there are up to 20 km (13 miles) of runs, the longest one 3 km (nearly 2 miles) in length. Besides using the ski lifts, you can also get up to the top by donkey. It's a lot cheaper than the Alps, and generally uncrowded, but opinions of the skiing vary. Remember: whether the snow is powder, crust or slush, the Arabs have only one word for it. The point, according to one visitor, is not to find the best snow but to amaze your friends by telling them you've been skiing in Morocco.

Clever policy wheezes are no doubt desired, but the big questions are also being asked. What are we for? Where next? It is a genuine seeking of answers. The brave will reply from the heart, risking implied criticism of what has gone before. Others may reflect back what they think is wanted in the hope of advancement. Some will advocate radicalism: others will say steady-as-she-goes. </p> <p>Bumping into one manifesto writer, the comment was: \"The manifesto? Look, we don't even know what the spin is yet, let alone what's in it.\" Oh, the cynicism, you might think! But that's not it. He meant something more serious. In a manifesto the medium - the spin - is the message that makes sense of inchoate substance. </p> <p>Labour has yet to decide if it wants to be (and be seen as) a radical progressive reforming force or prefers to be a decent, safe pair of hands. The balanced \"big tent\" beckons, with something to please everyone - a little tax cutting and law and order running alongside better public services and a bit more pulling up the poor by their bootstraps: con- sensus government for a non-ideological age. Other ministers want a fight to the death with the forces of conservatism. </p> <p>This manifesto will finally define whether the first term was a solid platform from which to mount a great leap forwards or just a small slope up which to trudge on slowly. While some want a noisy ideological fight, others urge a manifesto that does not wear its heart on its sleeve. Why risk frightening the horses? A modest manifesto leaves all options open, not foreclosing on radicalism but giving no hostages to fortune. </p> <p>There are good electoral reasons why Labour needs to stand and fight this time, no hedging. It needs firmer friends. The only danger at the election is a Labour vote sitting sourly on its hands at home.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street has sent out messengers to all ministers high and low to gather ideas for the coming manifesto. Clever policy wheezes are no doubt desired, but the big questions are also being asked. What are we for? Where next? It is a genuine seeking of answers. The brave will reply from the heart, risking implied criticism of what has gone before. Others may reflect back what they think is wanted in the hope of advancement. Some will advocate radicalism: others will say steady-as-she-goes. Bumping into one manifesto writer, the comment was: \"The manifesto? Look, we don't even know what the spin is yet, let alone what's in it.\" Oh, the cynicism, you might think! But that's not it. He meant something more serious. In a manifesto the medium - the spin - is the message that makes sense of inchoate substance. Labour has yet to decide if it wants to be (and be seen as) a radical progressive reforming force or prefers to be a decent, safe pair of hands. The balanced \"big tent\" beckons, with something to please everyone - a little tax cutting and law and order running alongside better public services and a bit more pulling up the poor by their bootstraps: con- sensus government for a non-ideological age. Other ministers want a fight to the death with the forces of conservatism. This manifesto will finally define whether the first term was a solid platform from which to mount a great leap forwards or just a small slope up which to trudge on slowly. While some want a noisy ideological fight, others urge a manifesto that does not wear its heart on its sleeve. Why risk frightening the horses? A modest manifesto leaves all options open, not foreclosing on radicalism but giving no hostages to fortune. There are good electoral reasons why Labour needs to stand and fight this time, no hedging. It needs firmer friends. The only danger at the election is a Labour vote sitting sourly on its hands at home. Labour and its leader have no core fan club, the way Mrs Thatcher did even in her darkest hours. To be loved in politics it is necessary to dare to be hated too. That \"Forces of Conservatism\" speech briefly recognised this - but then Mr Blair retreated, uncertain. This election presents a God-given enemy. Who better than William Hague - extreme and opportunist embodiment of everything Mr Blair believes himself and his party not to be.

      "body": "<p>Before I even start this week I have to issue a correction. By a slip of the keys I had tour leader Carol and Kiwi Mike throwing books and buying wedding silk. Of course I meant Clare and Mike. I apologise for any distress, worry, relief or excitement caused to the three respective families. </p> <p>That done I will begin the tale of my strange week in Kathmandu - a week of two halves. Thursday evening we arrived after a two-day bus ordeal to the best shower and meal ever. Not only that, there was an abundance of red wine! I had to promise to send in the photo of me and Bruce ecstatic over wine and tiramisu (see <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399238,00.html\">picture gallery</a>). All my website photos make me look demented. I am quite normal, really. </p> <p>I instantly fell in love with Nepal and Kathmandu. The people are so friendly and the atmosphere laidback - read on to find me eating my words. On Friday, we had a whole day sightseeing around the valley. </p> <p>First to Pashupatinath, which houses Nepal's most important Hindu temple. On the banks of the sacred Bagmati river poor people are cremated. There were several underway when we arrived. No mourners, just the fire builders and tenders going quietly about their business. Here we declined the offer of a 'student', wearing two pairs of shorts, to see a holy man who could lift 60 - or was it six? - kilos with his most private of parts. </p> <p>From here to Bodhnath, where the largest Buddhist temple in Nepal dominates an area called 'Little Tibet'. It was a riot of colour with all the prayer flags, the monks in their robes and all the Tibetan art work. We all remembered to walk clockwise round the stupa. </p> <p>On to the wonderful, preserved town of Bhaktapur, full of exotic temples. The photo is of Nyatapola Temple (see <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399238,00.html\">picture gallery</a>), the tallest in Nepal. Nearby is Potters' Square, where potters were throwing pots in the street and there were thousands of pots drying in the sun. I love pots and would have bought one if I didn't have to carry it around for five more months. A very good day. </p> <p>Saturday, the last of the tour, was a free day. We hired a taxi and went out to Nagarkot to see the Himalayas. By chance we stumbled across a Nepalese pop-star making a video for his latest release (see <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399238,00.html\">picture gallery</a>). He readily agreed to a photo in return for a plug on the internet. A deal is a deal, so here goes: his name is Sunil Lama and the disc, a collection of Nepalese songs, is called 'Bhinte Bishauchha'. Can Woolworths cope with the rush? I hope you can make out the Himalayas in the background. </p> <p>By Christmas Eve, two of Carol's new group had arrived: Annie from Sydney and Nicole from London. One was still missing over the Atlantic. Time for me to move out into humbler accommodation. </p> <p>I had received several recommendations for the Kathmandu Guest House and did move there. Unfortunately they were very busy and I got a cold, dark, damp hole of a room. I moved out again. I did find the Holy Lodge suggested by Paul but it was full. I ended up in The Star - basic but clean and airy and a third of the price. Sadly, there is no heating and being 1,300 feet up it gets very cold at night. I do not really expect any sympathy! I am currently reading Escape from Kathmandu - the hero stayed here. </p> <p>The evening of Christmas Eve I was struck by the oddness of my situation. Here I was, in Nepal, in Kathmandu, in an Irish bar, with a Nepalese group playing Dire Straits and Pink Floyd without taking off their anoraks and woolly hats. Every so often they would revert to Nepalese pop songs, all of which had a reggae beat. En masse, the Nepalese (all men) would leap to their feet and dance - a strange hand-waving, hip-swivelling exercise. </p> <p>On Christmas Day, I went for a farewell walk with Clare and Mike to the Monkey Temple - the Buddhist stupa of Swayambhunath, at the top of an extremely steep flight of steps. All that pre-trip training didn't seem to have done much good - I was shattered. The monkeys (see <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399238,00.html\">picture gallery</a>) were quite scary as they careered about at an alarming speed. </p> <p>In the afternoon, tired of the only two sets of clothes that are culturally acceptable, I went shopping. It was difficult to find anything that was not Woodstock or Glastonbury, depending on your era, but I set off for our Christmas dinner sporting a new red shirt (see <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399238,00.html\">picture gallery</a>). Bruce nicked some cotton wool off the tree to dress up as Santa and had brought along some friends - Rudi the reindeer and two elephants. </p> <p>Our group had grown to nine. The missing American had turned up, unfortunately his luggage had not. We had gained another tour leader - Holly - and Richard, a stray from a previous tour. It was a good meal, although I was not too sure about the plum pudding! My thanks to the poor Canadian girl who took endless group photos as more and more waiters wanted to be in it. So goodbye to Clare and Mike, flying back to New Zealand after three years' absence. I will miss them but have been promised a real Kiwi barbie if I make it to Wellington. </p> <p>On Tuesday, everything changed. I stepped into the street to meet three rows of police in full riot gear. The only sound was the rapid closing of metal shutters on all the shops. I retreated back to the hotel when I became aware of loud bangs and palls of smoke. Nobody seemed to know what was going on. </p> <p>Four of us had booked tickets to a Nepalese dance show that evening. I scurried to their hotel, the streets in darkness without the shop lights. Normally, if you so much as pause a dozen taxis appear. It took three hotel staff going in different directions to find us one - at an extortionate price. </p> <p>Arriving late, we hoped we had not missed much of the show. We found they had waited for us - maybe not so surprising as we were the entire audience. The show was colourful and good (see <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399238,00.html\">picture gallery</a>), as was the fiery liquid they gave us. Embarrassingly, I was led on to the stage by a dancing yeti. We did manage to find a restaurant that let us in by a guarded side door but had to promise to go by 9 o'clock so they could shut. </p> <p>Carol and her new band had headed back to India early, so Wednesday was my first real day on my own. As I headed out for breakfast about 100 Nepalese marched past chanting and waving flags. At last I found out what was going on. Apparently an Indian Bollywood film star had, on a TV chat show, said how much he disliked the Nepalese. This had led to attacks on cinemas showing Indian films and on Indian shopkeepers. Full scale rioting had followed, with police and army using guns and tear gas. In Kathmandu, three people were killed, including a young girl in Thamel, where I am, caught by a stray bullet. Everything is shut, the atmosphere is tense, people are just hanging about and there are road blocks into the city - eating words time. </p> <p>There is no threat to foreigners. I wandered about trying to buy a bottle of water. I got one in the end by shouting under a shutter that was open about a foot. After missing the turning back to the hotel, I found myself in a street with tyres burning in the road and large groups of men reading posters on the walls. I beat an extremely hasty retreat. I had planned to go to Pokhara for a few days of trekking but all the ticket offices are shut and there are no buses anyway. My laundry has not turned up either. </p> <p>By Thursday, Kathmandu was shut up even tighter, if possible. Even some of the cafes and internet shops are shut. Those open are packed as there is little else to do. It has been a good chance for me to catch up on all my messages. I have visited the Golden Temple, eaten momo, done the places mentioned by Ali, Amanda, Shane and Babs; not enough time to do Paul's trip although it sounded good. Thanks everyone. </p> <p>It would be good to sort them all into folders by country if only I knew how. Any suggestion of a cheapish place to stay in Mumbai as I have a day between flights? Also, what is the best way to get about Malaysia? I fly into Singapore but want to go to Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak. </p> <p>Word has it that this trouble will all be over tomorrow, so I still hope to see in the new year at the foot of the Annapurnas, something I could not have anticipated a year ago. May 2001 bring pleasant surprises to everyone. HAPPY NEW YEAR.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The pavements of Glasgow speak volumes in the morning. Concrete slabs strewn with chip wrappers, beer cans and cigarette butts - symbols of a city with a sickness at its heart. </p> <p>Less than 50 miles separate Glasgow and Edinburgh, but the gulf in terms of health could not be wider. Stay in Edinburgh and you live longer. Stay in Glasgow and you die younger. \"It is really as stark as that,\" said Graham Watt, a professor in Glasgow University's department of general practice, who has found that on average men in Glasgow live five years less than their counterparts in Edinburgh. For women, the life expectancy gap was 2 years. </p> <p>There are several factors - smoking, a fatty diet, and alcohol - but the biggest is social deprivation. Two-thirds of Glasgow's postcodes are in areas of severe deprivation, compared with 7% in Edinburgh. And a third of Edinburgh's neighbourhoods are considered affluent, compared to 5% in Glasgow. </p> <p>\"The health gap is not difficult to explain,\" said Professor Watt. \"The predominant circumstance of Glasgow is quite severe deprivation, in Edinburgh it is one of middle class affluence.\" </p> <p>The big killer is coronary heart disease, or CHD. Four Scots die every hour from CHD, the worst rate in the UK and one of the worst in the world.

      "bodyText": "The pavements of Glasgow speak volumes in the morning. Concrete slabs strewn with chip wrappers, beer cans and cigarette butts - symbols of a city with a sickness at its heart. Less than 50 miles separate Glasgow and Edinburgh, but the gulf in terms of health could not be wider. Stay in Edinburgh and you live longer. Stay in Glasgow and you die younger. \"It is really as stark as that,\" said Graham Watt, a professor in Glasgow University's department of general practice, who has found that on average men in Glasgow live five years less than their counterparts in Edinburgh. For women, the life expectancy gap was 2 years. There are several factors - smoking, a fatty diet, and alcohol - but the biggest is social deprivation. Two-thirds of Glasgow's postcodes are in areas of severe deprivation, compared with 7% in Edinburgh. And a third of Edinburgh's neighbourhoods are considered affluent, compared to 5% in Glasgow. \"The health gap is not difficult to explain,\" said Professor Watt. \"The predominant circumstance of Glasgow is quite severe deprivation, in Edinburgh it is one of middle class affluence.\" The big killer is coronary heart disease, or CHD. Four Scots die every hour from CHD, the worst rate in the UK and one of the worst in the world. Glasgow is the CHD epicentre: citizens run a heart attack death risk of 260 per 100,000, whereas Edinburgh has a rate of 170 per 100,000. The Scottish executive says it recognises the \"particular problems\" facing Glasgow. This month, ministers announced a food tsar, charged with changing eating habits, and a physical activity task force. Much of the targeting will be of children.

In preparation for this holiday, salarymen the length and breadth of the nation have been on a marathon drinking binge to purge the worst memories of the past 12 months in a series of bonenkai (forget the year) parties.

The ECB raised interest rates this year to combat the weakness of the euro and the surging oil price, but has shifted to a neutral stance in the past few weeks amid growing evidence of a US-led slowdown in global growth. Some analysts say that the ECB would already have followed the US Federal Reserve by lowering rates, but it feared undermining the euro. Asked if financial markets had been wrong to expect an ECB rate cut in the first half of 2001 after seven rate increases since November 1999, Mr Duisenberg replied: \"I will leave it up to markets what they expect.

Abbey attack Anyone taking a break from the prandial excess that is Christmas Day by flicking through the TV channels might have noticed that viewers were being subjected to a new push by Abbey National aimed at recruiting current account customers. Alan Davies, the comedian who has fronted a number of campaigns for Abbey, is leading the bank's charge, which is also being backed up by the largest-ever poster campaign that began a week or so ago.

That is very much in line with Abbey's ambition to increase the number of its current account customers from 3m to 4m by 2003. While Lloyds TSB will be able to cite the assault on the current account market by Abbey, and Halifax for that matter, as evidence of healthy competition in the sector, it might not necessarily appear that way to the competition authorities. It will be their blessing that Lloyds TSB will need if it does make a bid for Abbey, and they might want to consider the implications of Lloyds acquiring a competitor in the sector.

The contemplation of next year's vast crop of books, then, is a tricky affair, and some of the books featured in this sneak preview may well turn out to be dodos.

For several hundred million people, the four horsemen of the apocalypse - pestilence, war, famine and death - have never struck a more distant echo. Instead, a sustained period of democratic hegemony and economic growth, together with public education and health services, have made peace and prosperity the birthright for a small but significant proportion of the world's population. For all the flaws and lurking injustice in our society, the discourses of universal human rights and of sexual and racial equality have made a real dent on some ancient abuses. Remember that a child born even a century ago would have been lucky to make it into adulthood at all. If that child was female then, even assuming she survived to maturity, she ran a serious risk of dying in childbirth. Health, let alone happiness, could not be taken granted. So how times have changed. And yet, looked at another way, we (the postwar generations) have had the best, and what we bequeath to the children of the new century is a planet used, despoiled and poisoned. Their inheritance is a big, ugly mess - a global environmental catastrophe which, if they cannot clear it up, will threaten their very survival. It does not take much imagination to hear those four horsemen galloping right back into town. It all depends whether you believe in progress or not. Oddly, in our secular, godless age, this still seems a matter of faith. (Matt Seaton) <br> <b> 2 Will it still be a good time to buy a house?</b> Probably, provided it is a house you really do want to live in rather than one you think will make you rich overnight. According to the Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, the \"affordability\" of houses will return to its long-term average next year. While houses will be relatively affordable in terms of your relative income, the actual price of houses will continue to rise but at a much steadier pace than recently. Halifax predicts a 4% rise in house prices next year - almost half of the pace in 2000 - although with the usual hotspots in the south-east of England. This suggests that prospective buyers will not be left frustratedly watching the price of their dream home spiral ever higher. It also suggests, however, that any lingering hopes of selling your existing home for \"silly money\" should also be dampened. Aside from being sure that you have enough savings to cover the cost of moving, the other factor to bear in mind is interest rates. Halifax, and many other major banks, expect interests rates to fall rather than rise in 2001 as the economy slows and unemployment gradually starts to rise. \"The background is quite supportive for house buyers,\" said Martin Ellis, group economist at the Halifax. (Jill Treanor) <br> <b>3 Will it be a better year for black and Asian people? </b>Where rhetoric is concerned, no. With an election looming, the issues of asylum, immigration and law and order will be top of the agenda. While race might not be explicitly mentioned in connection with any of them, it will be the dominant subtext. While there are swathes of deep-seated prejudice, there are also signs that many in Britain have moved on from the Powellite era and see parties who exploit those issues as being unecessarily divisive and backward-looking. While Hague has made it obvious how he will play it, it is not clear how Labour will respond. They have not been above stooping to this level (remember the bulldog in the last campaign) and they may feel they have to prove they are tougher in this area than the Tories. However, they have occasionally come out fighting on matters of principle. Materially, things should improve. While unemployment remains high among some ethnic groups, any government action to improve the lot of the poor, underpaid and unpaid (particularly lone parents, workers on the minimum wage and government workers) will disproportionately benefit ethnic minorities. (Gary Younge) <br> <b> 4 Should I become a vegetarian? </b> Things are pretty tough for omnivores these days. Just when you thought beef was back on the menu, doubts were raised about anti-BSE measures, in both Britain and France. Food safety officials want to run the rule over Ireland, too, to ensure the risk of variant CJD developing is as small as possible. But, whatever you say about beef, it's very cheap if you're on a budget. So is poultry, but the dangers of contracting food poisoning from poorly cooked chicken in a restuarant or fast-food joint are probably higher than from other forms of meat, but not inevitably fatal. Lamb? Cross fingers another type of Sunday roast is not a BSE hazard, too - scientists are currently going to great lengths to check sheep are safe. Fish is a healthy option but is in such short supply around our coasts that we are in danger of stealing the developing world's most accessible source of protein. Worried about genetically modified food? Well, just think of all the GM content in the feed of factory-farmed livestock. Feeling guilty about welfare? Should you bring home the bacon imports from countries where the pigs are inhumanely raised? Experts advise those of us who don't want to sacrifice the eating of flesh to check where the food comes from. It may be difficult for most of us to watch Daisy, Bluebell or any other cow from childhood to dinner plate, but your supermarket, butcher, fast-food outlet or hotel chef might just know the provenance of every ingredient. Admire their knowledge or watch them squirm, and judge for yourself whether the meat may really have fallen off the back of a lorry. Is organic meat any healthier? Our food standards protectors say not. And most of it is far more expensive, and deliberately so. There may be extra costs but manufacturers processing the food deliberately put a premium on it, too, which causes a problem for low-income households. Vegetarians, on the other hand, avoid having to make all those tough choices. (James Meikle) <br> <b> 5 Would I be more fulfilled if I became a crofter? </b> Trading in a hectic urban lifestyle and following in the footsteps of BBC1's Castaway heart-throb Ben Fogle may seem attractive. But it's a tough road to take. Finding a croft is incredibly difficult. Few come on the market and, when they do, there's a lot of competition. And after you've got one, your problems are only just beginning. The next step is to convince the Crofting Commission you're serious about your new vocation. This is not easy, since it is much more likely to rubber-stamp new tenants who have family roots in the Highlands. Then there is the hours you would have to work. Most crofters also have day jobs to help make ends meet. Far from enjoying a hardy but fulfilling lifestyle, you would be slaving twice as hard to keep afloat. And the ravages of globalisation have seriously affected local economies. Sheep have recently been sold at auction for \u00a31.80. Even worse, the last survey of crofting incomes showed the average wage was 80p an hour. And if you did take the plunge you probably wouldn't be all that welcome in your new community. There is a long tradition, starting with Boswell and Johnson's visit in 1773, of metropolitan chatterers spending time with crofters. This was followed by another Johnson, Paul, in 1973. Predictably, he observed that the locals did not deserve to live in such beauty. Prince Charles has since turned his private trips into more public affairs and once arrived with Selina Scott and a film crew in tow. These expeditions have not done much to endear the residents to those from the professions. I for one have every intention of returning to work after Christmas. (Benjamin Wegg-Prosser) <br> <b> 6 Will doctors be able to grow me a new heart? </b>Next year is pushing it. If your need is that urgent, you'd better get your name on the lengthy waiting list for Papworth or Harefield in the hope of a good old-fashioned transplant. But in a few decades' time, the idea of donated organs will seem as outdated as blood-letting. Tissue engineering is galloping ahead. There is now an ambitious international collaboration planned, costed at \u00a33bn, to grow the first human heart by \"seeding\" heart cells onto degradable scaffolding, as has been done with skin and cartilege. But stem cell research promises to make this Frankenstein technology redundant. Stem cells are the basic building blocks - the tiny cluster of cells that make up an embryo that's a few days old, and that can turn into any part of the human body. Scientists believe they will be able to trick these cells into developing into tissue or organs such as heart muscle needed to save lives. So-called therapeutic cloning, by taking cells from a patient, inserting them into the emptied nucleus of a human egg and growing embryonic cells, would ensure the new heart muscle is a perfect match. Anti-rejection drugs would be a thing of the past. Already, scientists have succeeded in directing stem cells to become bone cells. The era of tailor-made replacement parts is almost upon us. The only question that will remain is an enormous ethical one. If we can replace all the body parts that wear out, how will we decide when it is time to die? (Sarah Boseley) <br> <b> 7 Who will win the next general election? </b> Just before the 1983 general election, a far-sighted publisher took the precaution of paying both Simon Hoggart (Guardian columnist) and I a \u00a31,000 advance to co-author a book on Michael Foot's unexpected defeat of Margaret Thatcher. Neither of us expected it to happen (and Foot was duly trounced at the polls) but such was our respect for the publisher that we took his money. He gallantly refrained from asking for it back later. No such offer has been made as William Hague slouches towards polling day to be undone by the shiny forces of New Labour. It is a sensible prediction that the Tory leader will do better than the opinion polls currently suggest: 47% to 32% compared with 44.4% to 31.4% on May 1 1997. But the Lib Dems' fate remains a wild card in the hands of tactical voters. But I do not know many MPs of any persuasion, apart from Hague himself, who believe that he can win. My guess this new year is that Labour's majority will not increase, but will fall probably below 100 as heartland abstentions combine with the return of defecting Jimmy Goldsmith Tories to the party fold. Charles Kennedy (he knows it) will also be lucky to retain his 47-strong flock at Westminster, the largest third-party contingent since 1929 but almost as impotent as if they had six as in 1951. Blairism will go on much as it does now. With luck there will be more Tory MPs to make parliamentary accountability work better, more Labour MPs willing to risk the wrath of Blair, too. We'd all be better off for it - including Blair. (Michael White) <br> <b> 8 Should I bother sending my children to school?</b> You don't have to. If you have money, time and infinite patience, you could try educating him or her at home, as 150,000 other children across the UK are. But Labour's steady 20-point lead over the Tories on education suggests that parents who do send their children to school are happier than they were. The literacy and numeracy hours have had a big impact and, school-wise, it is probably not a bad time to be a seven- or eight-year-old. Less good to be in the academic \"dip\" in the early years of secondary school or preparing to get saddled with debt at university. The lottery of provision remains intact, with the grammar schools and the independent sector resilient, and ever-increasing numbers of partially selective, high-demand specialist schools. But significant sums are reaching headteachers' budgets at last, and results are improving in all areas. Among the great and good of education there is a greater consensus, for better or worse, than there has been for a generation. William Hague's free schools plan, which would allow schools to decide unilaterally to become selective, is doing a passable imitation of a crackpot theory and would break up that consensus spectacularly. Labour has to balance teachers' appeals for a period of consolidation with showing it hasn't run out of ideas, and is thinking about moving GCSEs forward a year. From think-tank land, there is lots of work being done on the shape of the school day. The internet is transforming homework and playing its part in school, but the \"classroom of the future\" remains in the future for now. No one has yet decisively proved the case against collective learning, in a classroom, with members of a peer group. On the other hand, there is enthusiasm for keeping schools open longer, to get away from the 8.30am to 3pm mindset, and for targeting children's educational needs more effectively. (Will Woodward) <br> <b>9 Is there anyone we should declare war on? </b> Britain is already engaged in at least two wars, though it plays down involvement in both of them. The RAF continues to make bombing raids over Iraq, and the army and navy are both engaged in the Sierra Leone conflict. In neither case has there been a formal declaration of war. Becoming involved in conflicts these days tends to be less straightforward. Britain went into the war in Sierra Leone under the guise of protecting European Union citizens who want to to evacuate. An old-fashioned response aimed at bringing a swift end to the Sierra Leone civil war would require decisive action against neighbouring Liberia, where the government led by Charles Taylor is helping to fund the Sierra Leone rebels. Diplomatic pressure on Taylor's government is, thankfully, the international community's preferred option to war. Why stop at Sierra Leone and Liberia? There is so much conflict in Africa, not least the Congo. The British government, already heavily committed in peacekeeping roles around the world, says it has limited resources and only intervenes where it can make a difference. With globalisation, the boundaries of the old nation states have become less and less rigid. Enemies are less easily identifiable. The kind of \"wars\" that Britain should be engaged in are against the arms trade, against \"blood\" diamonds and and international corruption. These \"wars\" have so far been fought with only limited degrees of success: a certification scheme aimed at cleaning up the diamond industry is in its infancy, a bill on the arms trade is still to be brought before parliament and next to nothing has been done on international corruption. (Ewen MacAskill) <br> <b> 10 Will we find a black monolith on the moon? </b> No, that scene from the movie 2001 won't take place - because no living human has been to the moon since 1972 (although the ashes of the late Gene Shoemaker landed on the moon in a robot Lunar Prospector in 1999) and there are no plans to return. But there is a manned space station taking shape a mere 240 miles above our heads. Cassini-Huygens, an unmanned craft the size of a small bus, is heading towards a date with Saturn, and a landing on Titan in 2004. Tomorrow it will pass close by Jupiter. There is a little spacecraft called Stardust already heading for a rendezvous with Comet Wild 2 in 2004. It will scoop up some comet dust and bring it back to earth. A European-British mission will land on the moon in the last days of 2003. There are plans to touch down on Jupiter's moon Europa, drill through its icecap and lower a robot sub- marine into the ocean underneath. Pioneer 10 has been streaming away from earth since 1972, and is now 7bn miles away. In a mere 2m years, it will reach the constellation Taurus. Voyager 1 and 2, which actually carry messages for aliens, along with a record of earth noises, are more than 7bn and 5bn miles away, and leaving the solar system at more than 35,000mph. Altogether, Nasa and Europe have about 30 space missions in operation and one or two are technically dead, but still twitching. All are robot-driven - but some of them are smart enough to know a black monolith when they see one, and report back. (Tim Radford) <br> <b>11 What language should I start to learn? </b> There is clearly only one answer to this question. But you should already be fluent in the basic grammar of Texan, despite its idiosyncracies. The alternative to grapple with is standard Chinese. The census that is now being carried out will confirm that China has by far the largest population in the world - at 1.3bn. With a nation that big, anything the Chinese people does has immediate and potentially devastating consequences for the rest of us. Imagine what would happen if Beijing were to decide that the country's love affair with the bicycle was beneath its dignity and switch to the car (a threat which party officials mumble from time to time). The greenhouse gas emissions would make American pollution levels appear ecologically sound. As the world's fourth nuclear power, China will also be closely watched by that ol' boy from Texas. Beijing's obsession with bringing Taiwan under its control has the potential to seriously rock relations with Washington. With Dubya at the helm, who knows where that may end. On a more positive note, the far east will grow rapidly more present for us as its economic world and ours intertwine. This year Beijing will enter the World Trade Organisation, and that will mean the opening up of Chinese markets and more goods stamped: \"Made in China.\" In turn, we will be exposed more deeply to the extraordinary range of Chinese culture - from its ancient script to the planned new national opera house in Beijing with its futuristic egg-shaped design. Only one snag to Chinese: each word is a separate character, and you have to memorise at least 4,000 to be able to read a newspaper. (Edward Pilkington) <br> <b> 12 Any chance Oasis will finally implode for good? </b> British record companies should have a plaque reading \"no more heroes\" nailed over the front door. Whenever the biz trumpets its latest world-shaking phenomenon, you can guarantee it'll go straight down the plughole. Richard Ashcroft has tumbled dramatically from rock'n'roll bard to po-faced bore. Ronan Keating has embraced premature middle age with disastrous consequences, and Oasis are only managing to cling on to the gossip columns for all the wrong reasons. Spectators relished Liam Gallagher's yobbish spats with Robbie Williams and Patsy Kensit's tearful reports of her life of misery. But the live album, Familiar To Millions, might more accurately have been called Dimly Recalled By Dozens. How ironic that, as the Oasis bubble deflates, Blur's Best Of collection has appeared to remind everyone of the band's wit, versatility and impressive longevity. It would surprise nobody if Oasis split for good before Easter, amid further hair-tearing over the failure of British pop music to swamp the American charts (except the enigmatic Dido, who is big in America but unknown here). But while it's true that the UK has more than enough paper-thin boy bands and idiotic girlie pop, would any rational individual seriously yearn for a return of sclerotic 1980s behemoths such as Phil Collins or Dire Straits? And if success in the US means churning out clones of Limp Bizkit and the Backstreet Boys, we should be grateful that we can produce Craig David, the perverse Radiohead and good old David Gray instead. Anyway, if all else fails, we've got Madonna here to save us. (Adam Sweeting) <br> <b> 13 What's the next era due for a fashion revival? </b>Fashion is always looking over its shoulder pads to the past for inspiration. This year has been particularly retro, with clothing cullings from the 1920s (clutch bags), the 40s (pencil skirts, war bride style high heels), the 50s (knee-length bias cut skirts) and, of course, the 80s (gold, logomania and the rest of the tacky paraphernalia)\u0085 but all are already pass\u00e9 again (re-pass\u00e9?). So what's left - the 60s and the 70s? Hardly a mouth-watering prospect. Designers such as John Galliano might like to make references to centuries past with hoop skirts and complex corsetry, but even the increasingly skilful high streets would struggle to churn out cheap copies, and these mass-market derivatives are vital for a trend to last. But we haven't run the 20th century dry just yet. In a business where anything that happened five minutes ago is, well, so five minutes ago, something that ended two years ago is ancient history, certainly ripe for a revamp. Get ready for a return to the 90s: re-styled and recycled grunge, hooded tops and that 90s classic, combat trousers - all treated as style emblems, iconic and ironic. Extra points if your gear is actually from the 90s: genuine vintage combats will be where it's really at. (Hadley Freeman)",

An old-fashioned response aimed at bringing a swift end to the Sierra Leone civil war would require decisive action against neighbouring Liberia, where the government led by Charles Taylor is helping to fund the Sierra Leone rebels. Diplomatic pressure on Taylor's government is, thankfully, the international community's preferred option to war. Why stop at Sierra Leone and Liberia? There is so much conflict in Africa, not least the Congo. The British government, already heavily committed in peacekeeping roles around the world, says it has limited resources and only intervenes where it can make a difference. With globalisation, the boundaries of the old nation states have become less and less rigid. Enemies are less easily identifiable. The kind of \"wars\" that Britain should be engaged in are against the arms trade, against \"blood\" diamonds and and international corruption. These \"wars\" have so far been fought with only limited degrees of success: a certification scheme aimed at cleaning up the diamond industry is in its infancy, a bill on the arms trade is still to be brought before parliament and next to nothing has been done on international corruption. (Ewen MacAskill) 10 Will we find a black monolith on the moon? No, that scene from the movie 2001 won't take place - because no living human has been to the moon since 1972 (although the ashes of the late Gene Shoemaker landed on the moon in a robot Lunar Prospector in 1999) and there are no plans to return. But there is a manned space station taking shape a mere 240 miles above our heads. Cassini-Huygens, an unmanned craft the size of a small bus, is heading towards a date with Saturn, and a landing on Titan in 2004. Tomorrow it will pass close by Jupiter. There is a little spacecraft called Stardust already heading for a rendezvous with Comet Wild 2 in 2004. It will scoop up some comet dust and bring it back to earth. A European-British mission will land on the moon in the last days of 2003. There are plans to touch down on Jupiter's moon Europa, drill through its icecap and lower a robot sub- marine into the ocean underneath. Pioneer 10 has been streaming away from earth since 1972, and is now 7bn miles away. In a mere 2m years, it will reach the constellation Taurus. Voyager 1 and 2, which actually carry messages for aliens, along with a record of earth noises, are more than 7bn and 5bn miles away, and leaving the solar system at more than 35,000mph. Altogether, Nasa and Europe have about 30 space missions in operation and one or two are technically dead, but still twitching. All are robot-driven - but some of them are smart enough to know a black monolith when they see one, and report back. (Tim Radford) 11 What language should I start to learn? There is clearly only one answer to this question. But you should already be fluent in the basic grammar of Texan, despite its idiosyncracies. The alternative to grapple with is standard Chinese. The census that is now being carried out will confirm that China has by far the largest population in the world - at 1.3bn. With a nation that big, anything the Chinese people does has immediate and potentially devastating consequences for the rest of us. Imagine what would happen if Beijing were to decide that the country's love affair with the bicycle was beneath its dignity and switch to the car (a threat which party officials mumble from time to time). The greenhouse gas emissions would make American pollution levels appear ecologically sound. As the world's fourth nuclear power, China will also be closely watched by that ol' boy from Texas. Beijing's obsession with bringing Taiwan under its control has the potential to seriously rock relations with Washington. With Dubya at the helm, who knows where that may end. On a more positive note, the far east will grow rapidly more present for us as its economic world and ours intertwine. This year Beijing will enter the World Trade Organisation, and that will mean the opening up of Chinese markets and more goods stamped: \"Made in China.\" In turn, we will be exposed more deeply to the extraordinary range of Chinese culture - from its ancient script to the planned new national opera house in Beijing with its futuristic egg-shaped design. Only one snag to Chinese: each word is a separate character, and you have to memorise at least 4,000 to be able to read a newspaper. (Edward Pilkington) 12 Any chance Oasis will finally implode for good? British record companies should have a plaque reading \"no more heroes\" nailed over the front door. Whenever the biz trumpets its latest world-shaking phenomenon, you can guarantee it'll go straight down the plughole. Richard Ashcroft has tumbled dramatically from rock'n'roll bard to po-faced bore. Ronan Keating has embraced premature middle age with disastrous consequences, and Oasis are only managing to cling on to the gossip columns for all the wrong reasons. Spectators relished Liam Gallagher's yobbish spats with Robbie Williams and Patsy Kensit's tearful reports of her life of misery. But the live album, Familiar To Millions, might more accurately have been called Dimly Recalled By Dozens. How ironic that, as the Oasis bubble deflates, Blur's Best Of collection has appeared to remind everyone of the band's wit, versatility and impressive longevity. It would surprise nobody if Oasis split for good before Easter, amid further hair-tearing over the failure of British pop music to swamp the American charts (except the enigmatic Dido, who is big in America but unknown here). But while it's true that the UK has more than enough paper-thin boy bands and idiotic girlie pop, would any rational individual seriously yearn for a return of sclerotic 1980s behemoths such as Phil Collins or Dire Straits? And if success in the US means churning out clones of Limp Bizkit and the Backstreet Boys, we should be grateful that we can produce Craig David, the perverse Radiohead and good old David Gray instead. Anyway, if all else fails, we've got Madonna here to save us. (Adam Sweeting) 13 What's the next era due for a fashion revival? Fashion is always looking over its shoulder pads to the past for inspiration. This year has been particularly retro, with clothing cullings from the 1920s (clutch bags), the 40s (pencil skirts, war bride style high heels), the 50s (knee-length bias cut skirts) and, of course, the 80s (gold, logomania and the rest of the tacky paraphernalia)\u0085 but all are already pass\u00e9 again (re-pass\u00e9?). So what's left - the 60s and the 70s? Hardly a mouth-watering prospect. Designers such as John Galliano might like to make references to centuries past with hoop skirts and complex corsetry, but even the increasingly skilful high streets would struggle to churn out cheap copies, and these mass-market derivatives are vital for a trend to last. But we haven't run the 20th century dry just yet. In a business where anything that happened five minutes ago is, well, so five minutes ago, something that ended two years ago is ancient history, certainly ripe for a revamp. Get ready for a return to the 90s: re-styled and recycled grunge, hooded tops and that 90s classic, combat trousers - all treated as style emblems, iconic and ironic. Extra points if your gear is actually from the 90s: genuine vintage combats will be where it's really at. (Hadley Freeman)",

      "bodyText": "A delayed white Christmas persuaded most of Britain to stay at home yesterday, and many areas were braced for fresh snowfalls overnight. Forecasters predicted snow showers with temperatures struggling to rise above freezing. The cold snap is expected to last into the weekend, although there are signs that milder weather could arrive in some areas on Sunday to bring a new year risk of more flooding after a rapid thaw. Children, many of whom had never before seen significant falls of snow, took to their sledges yesterday, but for most Britons the weather was less welcome. A Devon family had to be rescued by the RAF after venturing on to Dartmoor to view snowbound landscapes. Annie Carson, 11-month-old son Luke, and boyfriend Kevin Street were stranded for more than five hours when their car skidded on black ice and crashed into a bank. They called for help on a mobile phone but the snow was so bad that a police Range Rover could not get closer than a mile and half from the family. A police helicopter was unable to land because of the conditions. An RAF helicopter was scrambled from Chivenor in Devon. It landed on the road and took the three to safety. \"The conditions were horrible,\" said winch operator Sgt David Watson. \"It was minus two or three and, with a wind speed of up to 20 knots, it would have felt up to about minus 15-20 degrees.\" \"I am so scared of flying that I have never been on a plane,\" said Ms Carson. \"I get scared just standing on a chair. I was in tears. But I think it has cured my fear of flying.\" Baby Luke slept through the drama. In Hampshire, a 35-year-old driver, believed to be from London, was transferred to a neurology hospital in Southampton after a fence post speared his forehead as he overtook a car on the A27 at Fareham. His condition last night was described as critical. The victim's girlfriend and her family, who were passengers, saw the fence post smash through the windscreen and hit the man in the centre of the forehead. PC Duncan Inness said that the car suddenly went out of control and mounted a grass verge on the driver's side. \"It then hit a wooden fence and a cross-bar on the fence speared the driver's car and went into the man's head.\" The driver's parents, who live in Gosport, Hampshire, were at their son's bedside last night. It was believed he had been travelling to their home for a post-Christmas reunion when the accident happened. In the Lake District, heavy falls of snow covered the fells and temperatures fell to -8C. In the west of the region, the water in Whitehaven harbour froze for the first time in living memory, trapping fishing boats. \"It is something I have never seen in this country,\" said harbourmaster Dave Allan. \"I have worked near the sea all my life and it is a strange phenomenon which I can only describe as spectacular.\" He suggested the sea froze after mixing with fresh water following the installation of new sea lock gates. In Bridgwater, Somerset, a woman, 29, was charged yesterday with causing criminal damage to a snowman. She was arrested after allegedly attacking it outside a house and will appear before Sedgemoor magistrates on January 4. Meanwhile members of a Cayman Islands steel band were shivering, despite having prepared for their visit by standing in a supermarket freezer. The John Gray high school band, invited to play in London's January 1 parade, spent an hour in the walk-in freezer at a local supermarket. \"We had no idea about the cold so we asked English people and they suggested spending some time in a freezer,\" said Pat Doughlin, the band's leader. \"We spent an hour dressed in various clothing and we came out smiling. But out here this morning we were freezing our butts off.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's proposal for a European second chamber, made up of members of national parliaments, is facing a backlash from British MPs and peers. Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, is to mount a new year propaganda offensive in parliament in a bid to shore up support for the proposal. The degree of opposition voiced at Westminster has surprised and irritated Foreign Office officials. \"We have a serious job of persuasion ahead in Britain, let alone Brussels,\" admitted a Downing Street official. The prime minister put forward the idea of a second chamber made up of members of national parliaments in a speech in Warsaw three months ago. Mr Blair sees the proposal as the best hope for a distinctive British reform agenda in the wake of the EU's inter-governmental conference in Nice which saw further extension of majority voting. He wants the second chamber to act as a watchdog to prevent the European commission from coming forward with directives or regulations in areas that properly should be the preserve of nation states. He believes the idea could act as a constraint on the natural tendency of commission officials, and the European parliament, to back ever closer integration. It might also help connect national parliaments and citizens with the EU institutions. Mr Blair and the Foreign Office are working to convince Britain's European partners of the benefits of the proposals , and believe they have secured backing in principle from five other states, including Germany. Britain wants the proposal, enthusiastically supported by EU commissioner Chris Patten, to be one of the central ideas in the run-up to a further EU inter-governmental conference in 2003 or 2004. Pan-European support might help Mr Blair convince a sceptical British public that the tide of integration is finally being halted, so helping him to prepare the electorate for the possibility of joining a single currency. However, the idea was given a roasting when first scrutinised at Westminster by the Lords select committee on Europe. Opposition came not only from pro-integrationist Liberal Democrats, but also from Conservative sceptic peers, such as Lord Lamont, who might have been seen as natural supporters of the proposals. Lord Lamont argued the proposal would be unworkable without a written EU constitution setting out clearly the powers of the EU, the nation state and the region. Other peers said they feared the idea would be either a mere talking shop or an extra layer of EU bureaucracy. The Labour peer Lord Brooke said he struggled to see what the second chamber could achieve that was not already available. Similar resentment is building up on the Commons European scrutiny select committee. Britain is proposing the second chamber meet three or four times a year and have as many as 10 parliamentarians appointed from each state. It has not yet decided whether it should merely say whether a proposal satisfies the principles of subsidiarity or not, or whether it could order a delay or revision by the commission of an offending proposal.",

Some trans-Pennine routes were closed, including the Snake Pass from South Yorkshire to Manchester and the A635 from Holmfirth over Saddleworth Moor. The more northerly Woodhead Pass remained open.</p> <p>North Wales had also been particularly badly hit by snow.</p> <p>Rail services were relatively unaffected. A spokeswoman for Virgin Trains said there had been problems with frozen points in Cheshire early in the day, but services were running to the normal Christmas period timetable.</p> <p><b>Yorkshire and the north-east</b></p> <p>The north-east of England was spared the worst of Wednesday night's blizzards, but snow showers are promised for today, accompanied by brisk northerly winds. Temperatures are expected to plunge to -4C (25F).</p> <p>Train services on the east coast main line were running according to the emergency timetable, and no weather related delays were reported.</p> <p>\"There has been snow in Scotland and towards the southern end of the line, but we have had no problems,\" said a spokesman for Great North Eastern Railway.</p> <p>Leeds-Bradford and Newcastle airports remained open, but flights to London were disrupted because of snow at Heathrow and Gatwick.</p> <p>\"We have not had much snow here,\" said a Newcastle airport spokeswoman. \"But we have taken in diversions, including flights from Atlanta and Accra, which were due to land at Gatwick.\"</p> <p>A British Airways flight from New York was diverted from Manchester airport while it was closed but was able to head south again after an hour's delay.</p> <p>The region's roads were mainly unaffected, with traffic flowing freely on the A1.</p> <p>About two inches of snow fell in the Yorkshire Dales. \"It's stunningly lovely here today,\" said Cory Jones, director of the field studies centre at Malham Tarn.</p> <p>\"We had some snow on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but this new fall has been dumped on top of icy roads. But the snow ploughs and gritters have been out.</p> <p>\"The snow is in the valleys and on the tops, but it is not blowing or drifting.\"</p> <p>A ground temperature of -8C (18F) was recorded at the centre on Wednesday night, and yesterday's air temperature was -3C (27F).</p> <p><b>Ireland</b></p> <p>Much of Ireland, north and south, was covered in a heavy blanket of snow yesterday, causing hold-ups on the roads and at airports, and forecasters said the big freeze could last until Sunday.</p> <p>Most major roads were passable with extreme care, but many minor ones were blocked. Police warned drivers to make only essential journeys.</p> <p>Flights were delayed, and bus and rail services faced severe disruption.</p> <p>Belfast saw one of the heaviest snowfalls in years, with up to 18cm (seven inches) recorded at the international airport. Temperatures dropped as low as -13.9C (7F) in parts of Co Down on Wednesday night.</p> <p>\"It's certainly extreme compared to previous years, making driving conditions treacherous,\" said Rob Black of the meteorological office in Belfast.</p> <p>\"Temperatures will drop to -10C [14F] overnight, and there is still the risk of further snow. Saturday will be a dry but cold day.\"</p> <p>Grahame Frazer of the roads service said his gritting staff were working flat out to ease the situation, but so much snow had fallen so fast that it was difficult.</p> <p>Many flights were held up, and delays for travellers were compounded by weather problems at other UK airports.</p> <p>Belfast international airport's marketing director, Natalie Raper, said staff had to clear ice off the runway, and temperatures would have to rise before normal service could be resumed.</p> <p>She advised passengers to check with their airline before setting out for the airport. </p> <p> <b>The midlands</b></p> <p>Leicestershire was brought to a standstill yesterday by its heaviest snowfall in a decade. With up to six inches falling in parts of the Midlands, the M1 and other motorways were reduced to a single lane, and drivers exceeded the 30mph restriction at their peril.</p> <p>Leicester city council deployed 30 extra staff to grit the roads, but police said they had received several calls from people who had become stranded and urged motorists to take all possible precautions before setting out.</p> <p>Trains were also affected. Midland Mainline warned of delays of up to 40 minutes on all services through Nottingham due to snow on the tracks, and Virgin Trains told travellers that trains from Glasgow to Birmingham would have to depart early. In Staffordshire, bus companies suspended services.</p> <p>East Midlands airport was closed for almost eight hours while three-and-a-half inches of snow were cleared from runways. Only one flight was cancelled, but 13 others were delayed.</p> <p>Conditions in the region were expected to get worse last night, with temperatures dropping as low as -6C (21F). Scattered snow showers today are likely to be followed by another night of severe frost, but the met office predicted that the cold would let up slightly towards the weekend.</p> <p>Despite the difficulties on the roads, the weather's most serious casualty appeared to be a man who was taken to hospital in Wolverhampton suffering from severe hypothermia after plunging into an icy fishing pool to try to rescue his dog. His repeated attempts to save his pet failed.</p> <p><b>Scotland</b></p> <p>As temperatures in some parts of Scotland plummeted to a five year low of -14C (7F), heavy snowfall across the west of the country in particular brought severe disruption to travellers.</p> <p>Around 2,000 passengers were stranded at Glasgow airport after its runways were shut at 5.30am. Although 100 staff struggled to clear the snow, the runways did not reopen until mid afternoon, and many people were left struggling to get to their destination.</p> <p>Sandy Ferard, spokesman for Scottish airports, said: \"People are aware of what we are trying to do in keeping the airfield and runways clear. They can see the depth of the problem by simply looking out of the window and seeing a foot of snow.\"</p> <p>With up to two feet of snow falling in places, much of south and south-western Scotland was brought to a standstill by the atrocious weather.</p> <p>Gritters and snowploughs worked throughout the night and most roads were passable, but commuters in Glasgow, Argyll, Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway faced much longer journeys.</p> <p>Police said traffic on many main highways was not moving faster than 15mph.</p> <p>Strathclyde police advised all drivers not to travel unless absolutely necessary, and a spokesperson for AA Scotland admitted that the breakdown service was struggling to cope with the number of calls.</p> <p>Train passengers also felt the ill effects of the weather. Virgin Trains said there were delays on the west coast mainline, Strathclyde rail network was disrupted, and ScotRail said all services in affected areas were subject to delays and cancellations.</p> <p>A spokesman for the post office said no mail was delivered in Glasgow yesterday, and other areas had only restricted services.</p> <p>Forecasters said sub-zero weather and hazardous driving conditions would last until at least the end of the week. Snow is also expected in the east of the country, which largely escaped yesterday's bad weather.</p> <p><b>Eastern counties</b></p> <p>Householders in the region could expect further misery last night as more snow was predicted, with thermometers expected to plunge to -4C (25F) overnight and climb no higher than -1C in parts of Cambridgeshire today.</p> <p>Luton, Bedfordshire, was the worst hit of the English airports, closing to all flights as staff struggled to clear eight-and-a-half inches of snow from its runway. A spokesman said staff hoped to reopen it by late afternoon, but scores of flights were delayed and several were scrapped.</p> <p>There were angry scenes inside the terminal as easyJet cancelled eight flights. This was after keeping some passengers waiting for more than six hours, claiming that their flight was merely running late. The company's website urged others who had booked flights to avoid travelling yesterday if at all possible.</p> <p>Many travellers had problems getting to the terminal due to drifts on approach roads. Airport Way was blocked for two hours when a coach broke down there, and other buses had difficulties on the steep hill.</p> <p>Those scenes were repeated around the region as drivers were faced with sheet ice and deep snow. Police in Cambridgeshire said officers had dealt with 58 weather related traffic incidents by midday. The county council had been unable to treat roads until early in the morning because strong winds threatened to blow away the grit.</p> <p>In Bedfordshire, the bus company Arriva axed its services, and two accidents on the southbound carriageway of the M1 reduced traffic to a crawl.</p> <p>In Essex, a crash caused disruption on the M11 northbound in the Harlow area. Police also imposed a 40mph limit on the southbound track.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the county, 10 vehicles were involved in a crash on the M25 between Epping and Brentwood. No one was thought to be seriously injured.</p> <p><b>Wales and the south-west</b></p> <p>Up to six inches of snow fell across parts of Wales and the west country, where police and motoring organisations reported dozens of accidents in the treacherous conditions on the roads.</p> <p>Speed restrictions were in force on motorways throughout the region. Some minor roads in more isolated areas were impassable.</p> <p>With temperatures expected to drop well below freezing overnight, Gloucestershire police were warning drivers to expect even more hazardous conditions this morning as the melting snow turns to ice.</p> <p>Forecasters say the cold snap will continue until the weekend. More snow is expected today and tomorrow before milder air coming in from the Atlantic brings rain on Sunday.</p> <p>In north Wales, a supermarket lorry driver had a fortunate escape when his truck crashed from a 30ft high bridge after skidding on snow on the A55 dual carriageway near St Asaph. The driver was taken to hospital but released after treatment.</p> <p>Early morning rail services between London and the west country and in the Cardiff area suffered some disruption, but the main travel difficulties were on the roads, where driving conditions were described as horrendous in places.</p> <p>The eastbound carriageway of the M4 through south Wales was closed for an hour and a half between junctions 36 and 35 after a lorry jackknifed on sheet ice, and there were lane closures on the M5 through Devon, Somerset and Gloucestershire.</p> <p>In Dorset, the A37 between Dorchester and Yeovil was blocked by lorries whose drivers had lost control in the slippery conditions. Police across the region were advising motorists not to travel yesterday morning unless their journeys were essential. Roads that had not been gritted were described as \"very dangerous\".</p> <p><b>London and the south-east</b></p> <p>Londoners woke to find the city had turned white, after experiencing its heaviest snowfall for several years. Up to three inches of snow fell overnight, closing roads and disrupting transport services around the south.</p> <p>The bitter cold halted the London Eye on the banks of the Thames. Officials stopped rides for two hours after the wheel began to slow down when a part froze.</p> <p>Despite bright sunshine, temperatures stayed well be low 5C (41F) and were predicted to drop to -4C (25F) overnight. Further snow showers are predicted today around Bracknell, Berkshire.</p> <p>Across the region, police forces and motoring organisations struggled to cope with calls, as ice and snow caused a spate of road accidents.</p> <p>Major crashes involving lorries closed the northbound M40 at junction four in Buckinghamshire, and there were speed restrictions and lane closures on almost all motorways.</p> <p>Kent police said the M25, M26, M20 and M2 were all hazardous due to heavy snow, and there were several accidents in Hampshire on the M27, one of the main link roads to the west.</p> <p>In Hove, East Sussex, five people were injured when two buses and a police car crashed on black ice, and in Brighton part of the A27 was closed after lorries started sliding back down a steep hill.</p> <p>Hospitals saw drivers with whiplash injuries and pedestrians who had broken wrists and ankles. The day's only known fatality was an elderly man who collapsed, probably of a heart attack, as he shovelled snow outside his home in Coulsdon, Surrey.</p> <p>Hundreds of Railtrack workers had to de-ice tracks to keep trains running.</p> <p>On the London Underground system, there were delays on all lines and services were suspended on the Northern line between Hampstead and Edgware and between Archway and High Barnet.</p> <p>Flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were delayed and diverted while the runways were cleared, but only a few BA services were cancelled.</p>",

      "bodyText": "North-west Snowfalls brought widespread disruption to the region yesterday, with road and air travel severely affected. Six inches of snow fell in Greater Manchester and Cheshire overnight. Liverpool airport was still closed yesterday afternoon, and many flights on the discount airline EasyJet were cancelled. Manchester airport was closed for an hour as its runway was cleared of snow; hundreds of passengers were delayed. Racing at Haydock Park, near Wigan, Greater Manchester, had to be cancelled. In Cumbria, several inches of snow fell overnight, and the harbour at Whitehaven froze over. Temperatures fell as low as -8C (18F). The harbourmaster, Dave Allan, said: \"I have worked near the sea all my life, and it is a strange phenomenon which I can only describe as spectacular. \"It is something I have never seen in this country in all my time as harbour master.\" In Lancashire, a police helicopter was scrambled to take a pensioner, 76, from his farm near Chipping to Royal Preston hospital after he had suffered a heart attack. A spokesman for the meteorological office said: \"It looks as if the wintry weather is going to continue in the north-west until the weekend, with further snow showers and frost overnight. Temperatures will be as low as -2C [28F] or -3C [27F]. \"There will be local heavier falls of snow, particularly on hills and near the coast.\" Most motorways in the north-west were passable with care yesterday, but on some sections only two of the three lanes were open, and speed restrictions were in force everywhere. An AA spokesman said there had been heavy snow in Derbyshire and in Cumbria, where roads around Whitehaven and Workington were impassable. Some trans-Pennine routes were closed, including the Snake Pass from South Yorkshire to Manchester and the A635 from Holmfirth over Saddleworth Moor. The more northerly Woodhead Pass remained open. North Wales had also been particularly badly hit by snow. Rail services were relatively unaffected. A spokeswoman for Virgin Trains said there had been problems with frozen points in Cheshire early in the day, but services were running to the normal Christmas period timetable. Yorkshire and the north-east The north-east of England was spared the worst of Wednesday night's blizzards, but snow showers are promised for today, accompanied by brisk northerly winds. Temperatures are expected to plunge to -4C (25F). Train services on the east coast main line were running according to the emergency timetable, and no weather related delays were reported. \"There has been snow in Scotland and towards the southern end of the line, but we have had no problems,\" said a spokesman for Great North Eastern Railway. Leeds-Bradford and Newcastle airports remained open, but flights to London were disrupted because of snow at Heathrow and Gatwick. \"We have not had much snow here,\" said a Newcastle airport spokeswoman. \"But we have taken in diversions, including flights from Atlanta and Accra, which were due to land at Gatwick.\" A British Airways flight from New York was diverted from Manchester airport while it was closed but was able to head south again after an hour's delay. The region's roads were mainly unaffected, with traffic flowing freely on the A1. About two inches of snow fell in the Yorkshire Dales. \"It's stunningly lovely here today,\" said Cory Jones, director of the field studies centre at Malham Tarn. \"We had some snow on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but this new fall has been dumped on top of icy roads. But the snow ploughs and gritters have been out. \"The snow is in the valleys and on the tops, but it is not blowing or drifting.\" A ground temperature of -8C (18F) was recorded at the centre on Wednesday night, and yesterday's air temperature was -3C (27F). Ireland Much of Ireland, north and south, was covered in a heavy blanket of snow yesterday, causing hold-ups on the roads and at airports, and forecasters said the big freeze could last until Sunday. Most major roads were passable with extreme care, but many minor ones were blocked. Police warned drivers to make only essential journeys. Flights were delayed, and bus and rail services faced severe disruption. Belfast saw one of the heaviest snowfalls in years, with up to 18cm (seven inches) recorded at the international airport. Temperatures dropped as low as -13.9C (7F) in parts of Co Down on Wednesday night. \"It's certainly extreme compared to previous years, making driving conditions treacherous,\" said Rob Black of the meteorological office in Belfast. \"Temperatures will drop to -10C [14F] overnight, and there is still the risk of further snow. Saturday will be a dry but cold day.\" Grahame Frazer of the roads service said his gritting staff were working flat out to ease the situation, but so much snow had fallen so fast that it was difficult. Many flights were held up, and delays for travellers were compounded by weather problems at other UK airports. Belfast international airport's marketing director, Natalie Raper, said staff had to clear ice off the runway, and temperatures would have to rise before normal service could be resumed. She advised passengers to check with their airline before setting out for the airport. The midlands Leicestershire was brought to a standstill yesterday by its heaviest snowfall in a decade. With up to six inches falling in parts of the Midlands, the M1 and other motorways were reduced to a single lane, and drivers exceeded the 30mph restriction at their peril. Leicester city council deployed 30 extra staff to grit the roads, but police said they had received several calls from people who had become stranded and urged motorists to take all possible precautions before setting out. Trains were also affected. Midland Mainline warned of delays of up to 40 minutes on all services through Nottingham due to snow on the tracks, and Virgin Trains told travellers that trains from Glasgow to Birmingham would have to depart early. In Staffordshire, bus companies suspended services. East Midlands airport was closed for almost eight hours while three-and-a-half inches of snow were cleared from runways. Only one flight was cancelled, but 13 others were delayed. Conditions in the region were expected to get worse last night, with temperatures dropping as low as -6C (21F). Scattered snow showers today are likely to be followed by another night of severe frost, but the met office predicted that the cold would let up slightly towards the weekend. Despite the difficulties on the roads, the weather's most serious casualty appeared to be a man who was taken to hospital in Wolverhampton suffering from severe hypothermia after plunging into an icy fishing pool to try to rescue his dog. His repeated attempts to save his pet failed. Scotland As temperatures in some parts of Scotland plummeted to a five year low of -14C (7F), heavy snowfall across the west of the country in particular brought severe disruption to travellers. Around 2,000 passengers were stranded at Glasgow airport after its runways were shut at 5.30am. Although 100 staff struggled to clear the snow, the runways did not reopen until mid afternoon, and many people were left struggling to get to their destination. Sandy Ferard, spokesman for Scottish airports, said: \"People are aware of what we are trying to do in keeping the airfield and runways clear. They can see the depth of the problem by simply looking out of the window and seeing a foot of snow.\" With up to two feet of snow falling in places, much of south and south-western Scotland was brought to a standstill by the atrocious weather. Gritters and snowploughs worked throughout the night and most roads were passable, but commuters in Glasgow, Argyll, Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway faced much longer journeys. Police said traffic on many main highways was not moving faster than 15mph. Strathclyde police advised all drivers not to travel unless absolutely necessary, and a spokesperson for AA Scotland admitted that the breakdown service was struggling to cope with the number of calls. Train passengers also felt the ill effects of the weather. Virgin Trains said there were delays on the west coast mainline, Strathclyde rail network was disrupted, and ScotRail said all services in affected areas were subject to delays and cancellations. A spokesman for the post office said no mail was delivered in Glasgow yesterday, and other areas had only restricted services. Forecasters said sub-zero weather and hazardous driving conditions would last until at least the end of the week. Snow is also expected in the east of the country, which largely escaped yesterday's bad weather. Eastern counties Householders in the region could expect further misery last night as more snow was predicted, with thermometers expected to plunge to -4C (25F) overnight and climb no higher than -1C in parts of Cambridgeshire today. Luton, Bedfordshire, was the worst hit of the English airports, closing to all flights as staff struggled to clear eight-and-a-half inches of snow from its runway. A spokesman said staff hoped to reopen it by late afternoon, but scores of flights were delayed and several were scrapped. There were angry scenes inside the terminal as easyJet cancelled eight flights. This was after keeping some passengers waiting for more than six hours, claiming that their flight was merely running late. The company's website urged others who had booked flights to avoid travelling yesterday if at all possible. Many travellers had problems getting to the terminal due to drifts on approach roads. Airport Way was blocked for two hours when a coach broke down there, and other buses had difficulties on the steep hill. Those scenes were repeated around the region as drivers were faced with sheet ice and deep snow. Police in Cambridgeshire said officers had dealt with 58 weather related traffic incidents by midday. The county council had been unable to treat roads until early in the morning because strong winds threatened to blow away the grit. In Bedfordshire, the bus company Arriva axed its services, and two accidents on the southbound carriageway of the M1 reduced traffic to a crawl. In Essex, a crash caused disruption on the M11 northbound in the Harlow area. Police also imposed a 40mph limit on the southbound track. Elsewhere in the county, 10 vehicles were involved in a crash on the M25 between Epping and Brentwood. No one was thought to be seriously injured. Wales and the south-west Up to six inches of snow fell across parts of Wales and the west country, where police and motoring organisations reported dozens of accidents in the treacherous conditions on the roads. Speed restrictions were in force on motorways throughout the region. Some minor roads in more isolated areas were impassable. With temperatures expected to drop well below freezing overnight, Gloucestershire police were warning drivers to expect even more hazardous conditions this morning as the melting snow turns to ice. Forecasters say the cold snap will continue until the weekend. More snow is expected today and tomorrow before milder air coming in from the Atlantic brings rain on Sunday. In north Wales, a supermarket lorry driver had a fortunate escape when his truck crashed from a 30ft high bridge after skidding on snow on the A55 dual carriageway near St Asaph. The driver was taken to hospital but released after treatment. Early morning rail services between London and the west country and in the Cardiff area suffered some disruption, but the main travel difficulties were on the roads, where driving conditions were described as horrendous in places. The eastbound carriageway of the M4 through south Wales was closed for an hour and a half between junctions 36 and 35 after a lorry jackknifed on sheet ice, and there were lane closures on the M5 through Devon, Somerset and Gloucestershire. In Dorset, the A37 between Dorchester and Yeovil was blocked by lorries whose drivers had lost control in the slippery conditions. Police across the region were advising motorists not to travel yesterday morning unless their journeys were essential. Roads that had not been gritted were described as \"very dangerous\". London and the south-east Londoners woke to find the city had turned white, after experiencing its heaviest snowfall for several years. Up to three inches of snow fell overnight, closing roads and disrupting transport services around the south. The bitter cold halted the London Eye on the banks of the Thames. Officials stopped rides for two hours after the wheel began to slow down when a part froze. Despite bright sunshine, temperatures stayed well be low 5C (41F) and were predicted to drop to -4C (25F) overnight. Further snow showers are predicted today around Bracknell, Berkshire. Across the region, police forces and motoring organisations struggled to cope with calls, as ice and snow caused a spate of road accidents. Major crashes involving lorries closed the northbound M40 at junction four in Buckinghamshire, and there were speed restrictions and lane closures on almost all motorways. Kent police said the M25, M26, M20 and M2 were all hazardous due to heavy snow, and there were several accidents in Hampshire on the M27, one of the main link roads to the west. In Hove, East Sussex, five people were injured when two buses and a police car crashed on black ice, and in Brighton part of the A27 was closed after lorries started sliding back down a steep hill. Hospitals saw drivers with whiplash injuries and pedestrians who had broken wrists and ankles. The day's only known fatality was an elderly man who collapsed, probably of a heart attack, as he shovelled snow outside his home in Coulsdon, Surrey. Hundreds of Railtrack workers had to de-ice tracks to keep trains running. On the London Underground system, there were delays on all lines and services were suspended on the Northern line between Hampstead and Edgware and between Archway and High Barnet. Flights from Heathrow and Gatwick were delayed and diverted while the runways were cleared, but only a few BA services were cancelled.",

      "body": "<p>During even the frostiest years of the cold war, Yugoslavia stood out among socialist countries as the most advanced in terms of living standards, and the most liberal in terms of market reforms, freedom of movement and political debate. </p> <p>All of this changed after its break-up. Legitimate economic activity collapsed in the face of wars, international sanctions and state-sponsored criminality. Foreign tourists and investors began to be treated with suspicion, and stayed away. </p> <p>The victory of Vojislav Kostunica, Yugoslavia's new president, has initiated a welcome reversal of domestic and foreign policy. The choice made by Serbs at the ballot box this week only confirms that a new era of economic reform and international cooperation is in the offing. </p> <p>At face value, the state of the economy is gloomy. Yugoslavia has a per capita GDP of around \u00a3800, only marginally higher than that of Albania. Many full-time workers receive wages of less than \u00a333 a month. Poverty and unemployment are widespread, and foreign debt stands at 140% of GDP. </p> <p>Yet to take only the economic figures is to miss a significant part of the story. Forced to struggle from one day to the next, people learned to cope with adversity. Many hold down two, even three, jobs, with those completely disenfranchised from the state system turning to small private initiatives that have helped build an informal economy covering as much as 50% of GDP. While state-owned enterprises continue to run up large losses and debts, these privately owned, small enterprises are creating new jobs and generating profit. </p> <p>Two towns highlight this point dramatically, bankers from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have discovered during recent missions to the country. In Kragujevac, south of Belgrade, life revolves around one large state-owned car factory, Zastava, which produces the Yugo. Seventy thousand people once counted on Zastava for work. But production has slowed almost to a standstill, leaving many jobless and local suppliers with no business. Life in Kragujevac is harder still because a large portion of Serbia's 500,000 refugees, victims of four wars in a decade, are housed in the town. </p> <p>Yet just an hour's drive away is Cacak, where the local economy is based not on heavy industry but a plethora of small and medium-sized enterprises. The town has traditionally been more politically and economically progressive than elsewhere in Yugoslavia, helped largely by being small enough (population 55,000) to avoid the gaze of Belgrade. </p> <p>During elections in 1996, only seven of 70 locally elected seats went to Milosevic's party. In 1998 the town established its own independent radio and television. Today there are 3,000 local businesses in Cacak. </p> <p>For years it has been a tale of two cities and, indeed, two economic philosophies - one based on large-scale state-owned industry, the other more laissez faire. Cacak provides an example to the new Yugoslavia.

      "bodyText": "During even the frostiest years of the cold war, Yugoslavia stood out among socialist countries as the most advanced in terms of living standards, and the most liberal in terms of market reforms, freedom of movement and political debate. All of this changed after its break-up. Legitimate economic activity collapsed in the face of wars, international sanctions and state-sponsored criminality. Foreign tourists and investors began to be treated with suspicion, and stayed away. The victory of Vojislav Kostunica, Yugoslavia's new president, has initiated a welcome reversal of domestic and foreign policy. The choice made by Serbs at the ballot box this week only confirms that a new era of economic reform and international cooperation is in the offing. At face value, the state of the economy is gloomy. Yugoslavia has a per capita GDP of around \u00a3800, only marginally higher than that of Albania. Many full-time workers receive wages of less than \u00a333 a month. Poverty and unemployment are widespread, and foreign debt stands at 140% of GDP. Yet to take only the economic figures is to miss a significant part of the story. Forced to struggle from one day to the next, people learned to cope with adversity. Many hold down two, even three, jobs, with those completely disenfranchised from the state system turning to small private initiatives that have helped build an informal economy covering as much as 50% of GDP. While state-owned enterprises continue to run up large losses and debts, these privately owned, small enterprises are creating new jobs and generating profit. Two towns highlight this point dramatically, bankers from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have discovered during recent missions to the country. In Kragujevac, south of Belgrade, life revolves around one large state-owned car factory, Zastava, which produces the Yugo. Seventy thousand people once counted on Zastava for work. But production has slowed almost to a standstill, leaving many jobless and local suppliers with no business. Life in Kragujevac is harder still because a large portion of Serbia's 500,000 refugees, victims of four wars in a decade, are housed in the town. Yet just an hour's drive away is Cacak, where the local economy is based not on heavy industry but a plethora of small and medium-sized enterprises. The town has traditionally been more politically and economically progressive than elsewhere in Yugoslavia, helped largely by being small enough (population 55,000) to avoid the gaze of Belgrade. During elections in 1996, only seven of 70 locally elected seats went to Milosevic's party. In 1998 the town established its own independent radio and television. Today there are 3,000 local businesses in Cacak. For years it has been a tale of two cities and, indeed, two economic philosophies - one based on large-scale state-owned industry, the other more laissez faire. Cacak provides an example to the new Yugoslavia. But making sense of the chaotic state of large state-owned enterprises and banks will require painful and radical reforms, which means living standards could get even worse before they get better. In nearly a decade of helping the ex-communist countries of central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union shift to a market economy, the EBRD has learned a few lessons about why some countries have been successful and others less so. It is clear that from the outset, some countries, like Hungary - and indeed Yugoslavia itself - were more advanced than others. But what counts more are the varied paths they have followed since. Those that started economic reform early have progressed furthest and fastest, suggesting that success will rest on good leadership, sound decision-making and the will of the people. The most obvious lesson in this is that a credible stabilisation programme is essential if the conditions for sustained long-term growth are to be created. Private investors cannot operate in a climate of high inflation, exchange-rate instability and fiscal irresponsibility. Such a programme will involve painful choices, but experience shows that the alternative is far worse in the long-term. Staff from the bank who have been on the ground to determine recent progress in Yugoslavia sense that the right direction is being taken. Ownership issues must be clarified early on. No foreign businessman will dare invest in a company or bank where ownership is unclear. Long-term growth will never occur in the absence of the rule of law. The legal system has to be adapted to the challenges of transition. Finally, the response of the international community must be closely coordinated. It should also be realistic in terms of both implementation and sustainability. An important factor here is the evident goodwill between the international community and the Yugoslav authorities. Yugoslavia has joined the United Nations and the stability pact, while the European Union and bilateral donors are extending emergency aid to help the country through the winter. Just last week the shareholders of my institution agreed to extend membership to the country. Membership in the International Monetary Fund and other international bodies is imminent. With hard work by the people of the region, as well as by the international community, this part of Europe could achieve stability and rapid economic growth as well.

      "body": "<p>A black and white notice on a soft yellow sandstone building opposite the Wailing Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem yesterday seemed innocuous enough: \"Mayor's Office\". But it was the most provocative symbolic act by a hardline Israeli since Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in September, setting off the Palestinian uprising.</p> <p>The Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, normally lives in the Jewish part of the city. He moved into temporary headquarters in the Old City yesterday morning in protest against the proposed Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement, which includes the division of Jerusalem, in particular the holy site known to Jews as Temple Mount and to Arabs as the Noble Sanctuary.</p> <p>The kind of fundamentalism displayed by Mr Olmert yesterday was one reason why the planned meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was cancelled. The bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv, in which 13 were injured, was another, an act of extremism by the other side.</p> <p>The prospect of a meeting between Mr Barak and Mr Arafat, the first since October, gave hope that a peace deal might be possible. It may yet be resurrected, but the problems in the way of a settlement remain huge.</p> <p>Mr Olmert was voicing Jewish fears that if the proposal put forward by the US president, Bill Clinton, was adopted, the upper half of the holy site would be under Palestinian control and Palestinians might drop stones, or fire shots, at Jews praying and kissing the Wailing Wall below, as they have done in the past.</p> <p>Surrounded by supporters singing religious songs, Mr Olmert opposed any compromise. \"Our deep link with Jerusalem did not begin with Clinton or Arafat but with King David 3,000 years ago. Jerusalem was, and will remain, the Israeli capital,\" he said.</p> <p>Many of the Jews visiting the Wailing Wall yesterday shared his views, expressing similar fear at the prospect of Palestinian police and soldiers being stationed high above them. One of them predicted that the fight between Israelis and Palestinians would last for ever.</p> <p>An even bigger problem than the holy site and the complexity of dividing between Israelis and Palestinians the myriad streets that make up Jerusalem, is the fate of the 3.5m refugees.</p> <p>This is by far the main sticking point. Palestinian refugees, those who fled or left in 1948 and their descendants, are spread in camps throughout Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and other parts of the Middle East. Mr Arafat demands a peace settlement that recognises their right to return to Israel and to homes since occupied by Israelis. The Israelis refuse to countenance the potentially destabilising consequences of such a return.</p> <p><b> Refugees</b><br></p> <p>Mr Clinton proposed a compromise, recognising the right of the refugees to return to \"Palestine\", which is basically the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. But Palestinians would react with uproar and accuse Mr Arafat of a sell-out if he agreed to such a deal.</p> <p>It would mean that most of them would have to remain in exile. The Palestinian economy would be incapable of absorbing the refugees.</p> <p>The Palestinians round Mr Arafat argue that Mr Barak and Mr Clinton are pressed for time and that the Palestinians do not have to rush to join in what has been dubbed \"fast-food diplomacy\".</p> <p>Mr Clinton's presidency ends on January 20 and Mr Barak faces an election on February 6. Mr Arafat's advisers are convinced that Mr Clinton's deadline of this weekend is an artificial one and that they can continue pressing for more concessions up to January 10.</p> <p>But many Palestinians do not want a deal even if Mr Arafat manages to squeeze out more concessions. Some members of his own organisation, Fatah, oppose a compromise, as does the youth wing, the Tanzim, which has been active in the uprising, and leaders of the refugees camps. Both the fundamentalist groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, are, predictably, opposed in principle to a settlement.</p> <p>It is against this background that the Palestinian leadership sent a letter to Mr Clinton on Wednesday expressing doubts about his proposals. It was that letter that caused Mr Barak to cancel the summit meeting with Mr Arafat at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.</p> <p>Time is running out for Mr Barak, who needs a deal fast. He is trailing badly in the polls. That too is a factor in Palestinian thinking. Even if Mr Arafat agreed a deal, he could not be sure that Mr Barak would get the agreement through the Israeli parliament, or win the election, and his opponent Mr Sharon has said he would not abide by any agreement.</p> <p>Mr Arafat and Mr Barak may yet hold their summit and find a messy compromise. Reaching a settlement would be hard enough, but selling it to their respective sides would be even harder.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A black and white notice on a soft yellow sandstone building opposite the Wailing Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem yesterday seemed innocuous enough: \"Mayor's Office\". But it was the most provocative symbolic act by a hardline Israeli since Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in September, setting off the Palestinian uprising. The Israeli mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, normally lives in the Jewish part of the city. He moved into temporary headquarters in the Old City yesterday morning in protest against the proposed Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement, which includes the division of Jerusalem, in particular the holy site known to Jews as Temple Mount and to Arabs as the Noble Sanctuary. The kind of fundamentalism displayed by Mr Olmert yesterday was one reason why the planned meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was cancelled. The bombing of a bus in Tel Aviv, in which 13 were injured, was another, an act of extremism by the other side. The prospect of a meeting between Mr Barak and Mr Arafat, the first since October, gave hope that a peace deal might be possible. It may yet be resurrected, but the problems in the way of a settlement remain huge. Mr Olmert was voicing Jewish fears that if the proposal put forward by the US president, Bill Clinton, was adopted, the upper half of the holy site would be under Palestinian control and Palestinians might drop stones, or fire shots, at Jews praying and kissing the Wailing Wall below, as they have done in the past. Surrounded by supporters singing religious songs, Mr Olmert opposed any compromise. \"Our deep link with Jerusalem did not begin with Clinton or Arafat but with King David 3,000 years ago. Jerusalem was, and will remain, the Israeli capital,\" he said. Many of the Jews visiting the Wailing Wall yesterday shared his views, expressing similar fear at the prospect of Palestinian police and soldiers being stationed high above them. One of them predicted that the fight between Israelis and Palestinians would last for ever. An even bigger problem than the holy site and the complexity of dividing between Israelis and Palestinians the myriad streets that make up Jerusalem, is the fate of the 3.5m refugees. This is by far the main sticking point. Palestinian refugees, those who fled or left in 1948 and their descendants, are spread in camps throughout Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and other parts of the Middle East. Mr Arafat demands a peace settlement that recognises their right to return to Israel and to homes since occupied by Israelis. The Israelis refuse to countenance the potentially destabilising consequences of such a return. Refugees Mr Clinton proposed a compromise, recognising the right of the refugees to return to \"Palestine\", which is basically the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. But Palestinians would react with uproar and accuse Mr Arafat of a sell-out if he agreed to such a deal. It would mean that most of them would have to remain in exile. The Palestinian economy would be incapable of absorbing the refugees. The Palestinians round Mr Arafat argue that Mr Barak and Mr Clinton are pressed for time and that the Palestinians do not have to rush to join in what has been dubbed \"fast-food diplomacy\". Mr Clinton's presidency ends on January 20 and Mr Barak faces an election on February 6. Mr Arafat's advisers are convinced that Mr Clinton's deadline of this weekend is an artificial one and that they can continue pressing for more concessions up to January 10. But many Palestinians do not want a deal even if Mr Arafat manages to squeeze out more concessions. Some members of his own organisation, Fatah, oppose a compromise, as does the youth wing, the Tanzim, which has been active in the uprising, and leaders of the refugees camps. Both the fundamentalist groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, are, predictably, opposed in principle to a settlement. It is against this background that the Palestinian leadership sent a letter to Mr Clinton on Wednesday expressing doubts about his proposals. It was that letter that caused Mr Barak to cancel the summit meeting with Mr Arafat at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Time is running out for Mr Barak, who needs a deal fast. He is trailing badly in the polls. That too is a factor in Palestinian thinking. Even if Mr Arafat agreed a deal, he could not be sure that Mr Barak would get the agreement through the Israeli parliament, or win the election, and his opponent Mr Sharon has said he would not abide by any agreement. Mr Arafat and Mr Barak may yet hold their summit and find a messy compromise. Reaching a settlement would be hard enough, but selling it to their respective sides would be even harder.",

A state of emergency is in force in Cacak.</p> <p>The crisis is caused by several factors: the disrepair of the electric system, Serbia's debts to several countries which supply it with electricity, a regional shortage of electricity, and a debt to Russia for natural gas that has prompted Moscow to reduce the flow.</p> <p>Low water levels have further reduced Serbia's ability to produce hydroelectric power and cool generators, while the export of electricity during the summer by the Milosevic regime to pay back debts also reduced the country's stock, she said.</p> <p>EU aid of around \u00a320m and additional money from Germany, totalling around \u00a31.3m, eased the situation before the election by enabling the country to pay off some of the accumulated debt.</p> <p>But Macedonia, Albania and Greece, which bailed out the country last winter, are not creating enough electricity to supply Serbia this winter, Ms Ferrari said.</p> <p>Bulgaria is supplying the whole of Kosovo, which as an international protectorate will pay its bills.</p> <p>That leaves just Hungary and Romania as Serbia's potential suppliers - and they themselves are short of electricity.</p>",

Serbs are angry that the 18-party coalition failed to prepare the country for the cuts and did not impose them until after election day, despite warning signs of an energy system collapse. \"Dos is promising too much and they made a mistake because they didn't inform people about this situation,\" said Vanja Lipovac, 38, an interpreter in Belgrade. She said she backed Dos because there was no other option. Milanka Ranisaljevic, a pensioner, was disillusioned, saying: \"This government is no better than the last.\" The power cuts have left homes in cold darkness for between eight and 18 hours in recent days and shut down many non-vital institutions. A worker in a Belgrade car parts company said: \"They are killing us. Our computers and telephones are not working. We are just sitting in the office and not doing any work.\" The energy minister, Srboljub Antic, has sought to divide the misery as equally as possible and bolster morale by promising no cuts at New Year, but he admitted that, with that exception, the punishing schedule would continue until January 3. A spokeswoman for the UN office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) - which has tried to monitor the situation - was less optimistic, saying that the immediate crisis might ease by mid-January, but shortages and power cuts would affect the country until March. And she added that the fundamental problems would not be solved for three to four years. The crisis poses a major challenge to the authorities. The coalition partners themselves predict further elections in six to eight months, and the energy shortage threatens to hamper their reformist plans to relaunch Serbia as a modern democratic state. Demonstrators have already taken to the streets. On Wednesday people from the small settlement of Atina blocked the main road north from the capital to Novi Sad. They said they had been without electricity for 20 days. In parts of Belgrade, protesters blocked main roads to voice their anger at 18-hour cuts. The Ocha energy specialist, Daria Ferrari, forecast long-term problems. \"It is extremely worrying,\" she said. She explained that although at first the blackouts only applied to domestic consumers, in recent days they had been extended to hospitals, schools and other institutions, such as television stations,regarded as having a high priority. In central Serbia the towns of Kraljevo, Cacak and Kragujevac are particularly badly affected because they have nowhere to store oil for heating. A state of emergency is in force in Cacak. The crisis is caused by several factors: the disrepair of the electric system, Serbia's debts to several countries which supply it with electricity, a regional shortage of electricity, and a debt to Russia for natural gas that has prompted Moscow to reduce the flow. Low water levels have further reduced Serbia's ability to produce hydroelectric power and cool generators, while the export of electricity during the summer by the Milosevic regime to pay back debts also reduced the country's stock, she said. EU aid of around \u00a320m and additional money from Germany, totalling around \u00a31.3m, eased the situation before the election by enabling the country to pay off some of the accumulated debt. But Macedonia, Albania and Greece, which bailed out the country last winter, are not creating enough electricity to supply Serbia this winter, Ms Ferrari said. Bulgaria is supplying the whole of Kosovo, which as an international protectorate will pay its bills. That leaves just Hungary and Romania as Serbia's potential suppliers - and they themselves are short of electricity.",

The Vehicles (Crime) Bill, published this month, aims to cut car crime by regulating the supply of number plates and introducing powers to regulate 3,000 businesses in the motor salvage industry who would be required to register with local authorities and keep records. 10 cars with the highest risk of theft in 1999 1 Nissan Laurel/Datsun Skyline pre-1985.

      "bodyText": "Police stormed a traffic island occupied by grieving relatives of the Christmas Day disco fire in Luoyang yesterday and tore down a banner demanding justice as thousands blocked the busy city centre road junction. More than 200 people marched down a main street and blocked the junction for 45 minutes, watched by large crowds. The police charged when about 10 relatives occupied a traffic control podium and raised a banner demanding justice for the \"Victims of 12-25\" - Christmas Day. The protesters demanded a meeting with officials and criticised the handling of the tragedy and what they called cold bureaucratic measures to identify the dead . The authorities are allowing only one relative of each victim into the mortuary, and insist that the bodies must be cremated within three days. Local anger has been increased by the revelation that the Dongdu department store building involved was declared one of the 40 most dangerous buildings in Henan province three years ago, that nothing had been done to remedy the deficiencies, and that the fire authorities wanted the building closed four days before the fire. Local newspaper websites said that in the emotionally charged atmosphere rumours of a cover-up were sweeping the city. Some people believed that 600 or 700 died. Partygoers had time to send messages and pleas for help by mobile phone before they were overcome by the smoke and flames, one newspaper reported On Wednesday the police arrested 12 people, including four welders suspected of causing the fire.The four were welding beams in the sub-basement on Monday night when sparks ignited rags and furniture, the police said. When water failed to douse the flames they fled without warning others in the building, including those partying in the unlicenced fourth-floor disco. The police said that six managers and employees of Dennis Co, the supermarket chain which ran the building, were among those arrested, the Luoyang Evening News reported. The basement fire spread to the first floor, and smoke clogged stairwells, trapping the partygoers and construction workers. More than 280 bodies have been identified so far, the Evening News reported. The relatives demanded compensation. But a leader of the march, who lost his brother in the fire, said: \"It's not about the money. It's about the way officials have done things and their attitudes.\" About 60 marchers gathered outside the closed gates of the municipal offices . A local official sympathised with the relatives' demands but added: \"We can't satisfy them just now.\" Another said: \"The most important thing at present is to maintain stability and keep social order.\" President Jiang Zemin expressed \"extreme concern\" and called for a speedy investigation, the Xinhua official news agency reported. Public anger at rampant disregard for public safety and a bureaucracy seen as corrupt or indifferent has worried the government. On Tuesday the public security ministry ordered officials throughout China to shut down unlicensed and unsafe dance halls and to check public venues. After the Dongdu fire, investigators discovered safety violations, lax management and inadequate supervision.The building had failed 18 safety checks in the past two years, the Southern Daily reported.",

      "bodyText": "Japanese doctors said yesterday that \"economy class syndrome\" - the supposed effect of long flights endured in cramped conditions - had caused more than three deaths a year at Narita airport, Tokyo, since 1992. The report is likely to prompt renewed calls for airlines to improve the seating on long-haul flights. The airport clinic said it had identified 25 fatalities attributable to the syndrome, which is associated with a lack of leg-room and opportunities to exercise. The study, Japan's first examination of the problem, found that between 100 and 150 long-haul passengers were treated for the syndrome upon arrival in Tokyo each year. The doctors said that about half the cases were serious. Passengers who spend hours in the cramped conditions of economy cabins are believed to be at risk of developing deep-vein thrombosis - blood clots in the legs - which can be fatal if the clots travel up to the heart or lungs. In October the syndrome was blamed for the death of the Australian Emma Christoffersen, 28, who collapsed at Heathrow airport minutes after disembarking from a 20-hour Qantas flight from Australia. The postmortem showed that a blood clot had moved from her foot to her heart. Experts are divided about the extent to which air travel heightens the danger of deep-vein thrombosis, but a parliamentary committee recently recommended that airlines should warn passengers of the health risks associated with long-distance flights. According to the latest study, pilots and passengers in all classes are at risk. \"It's wrong to assume that it is limited to economy class passengers,\" said Dr Toshiro Makino, who heads the airport clinic. \"The syndrome may have become well known only recently, but it has been around ever since people began flying.\" He said overweight and elderly passengers were most at risk. The survey said the average age of those who died was 64. Other at risk include sufferers of varicose veins or cancer, passengers with long legs, smokers, pregnant women and women taking birth-control pills. The warning signs include pain and swelling in the legs, and difficulty breathing. Dr Makino said alcohol should be avoided on flights because - along with the dry air in plane cabins - it causes dehydration, a factor in blood-clotting. A spokesman for Japan Airlines, the biggest user of Narita airport, told reporters that the company was aware of the syndrome and advised passengers to stretch their legs and drink water.",

The priority must be to develop centrally administered planning controls, so that new employment projects are discouraged or prohibited in areas which cannot absorb any increases in employment. Firms should be encouraged to locate in areas where labour market pressure is less. This may all sound very 60s, but at least they understood then that in a full employment economy regional policy and planning were required to keep the national labour market functioning smoothly. Since Thatcher, the false idea has taken root that all that is required is the occasional initiative in depressed areas. Dr Colin Crouch Harrow Weald, Middx \u0095 Your report on Labour MPs in southern England lobbying government to stop creating jobs in their constituencies should make ministers think carefully about the implications of giving the go-ahead to Heathrow terminal five later this year. A report from ClearSkies, the group representing residents under the flight path to Heathrow, showed that while a fifth terminal may create around 60,000 jobs, there were only 9,000 people registered unemployed in the six adjacent local authority areas. Employees will either be attracted from existing firms in the area that are not able to match Heathrow's wage levels, or they will be recruited from many miles way, thus adding to the already severe road congestion in west London.

      "body": "<p>There is no more recognisable sound in gospel music than the aching harmonies of the Staples Singers, underpinned by the husky murmur and throbbing electric guitar of Roebuck Staples, who has died aged 85. Leading his family group for more than 40 years, he was a pivotal figure in gospel in the 1960s and 70s, when the music gave a vivid voice to both the anger and the aspirations of the African-American community.</p> <p>Staples grew up near Winona, Mississippi, and as a boy was impressed by local blues guitarists such as Charlie Patton, who lived on a neighbouring plantation. \"That sold me on guitar,\" he recalled. \"My greatest ambition was then to play and record.\" It was a dream that he had to defer for some years while he and his wife Oceola brought up their children in Chicago, where they moved in 1935.</p> <p>He worked for the Armour tinned-meat company as a packer and killer and in his spare time sang with a gospel quartet, the Trumpet Jubilees. By his own account he \"didn't touch a guitar for at least 12 years\".</p> <p>The family group of Staples and his four teenage children, Cleotha, Purvis, Yvonne and Mavis, first appeared in public soon after the second world war, singing at neighbourhood churches. In the early 50s they began to be heard on records, first for Leonard Allen's United label, then for the larger Vee-Jay, where they made such unforgettable records as Don't Drive Me Away, This May Be The Last Time - later adapted by the Rolling Stones - and Uncloudy Day. The combination of Staples' tremolo-laden guitar and the wild beauty of Mavis's voice- what the jazz writer Stanley Crouch called \"their joy and thunder\" - was like nothing previously heard in gospel music, and Uncloudy Day sold, as Staples remarked, \"like rock 'n' roll\".</p> <p>In the early 60s the Staples Singers, now with Riverside records, looked for an audience beyond the ghetto, recording coffeehouse favourites such as Cotton Fields, Bob Dylan's Blowin' In The Wind and Woody Guthrie's This Land Is Your Land. Such choices were mildly controversial at the time, but Staples was quick to defend them. \"I think they're good material. I think it's time for the whole nation to start listening to something that means something, and think that this land belongs to everybody. If they would think like that we'd have a better United States.\"</p> <p>A further move in the late 60s to the soul label Stax found the family extending their range still further with aspirational soul material such as Respect Yourself, which won them a gold disc; the hypnotic chant I'll Take You There; and the million-selling If You're Ready (Come Go With Me). Staples also recorded an instrumental blues album, Jammed Together, with fellow guitarists Albert King and Steve Cropper. There were those who regarded these progressive accommodations to the secular music market as betrayals of the traditions the family were supposed to represent. To such accusations Staples succinctly replied, \"Ain't nobody want to go to heaven more than me, but we got to live down here too.\"</p> <p>The Staples Singers worked less after Mavis left to pursue a solo career, but in the 90s \"Pops\" Staples, as he now billed himself, enjoyed a spell of international success away from the family setting, appearing at blues festivals - though steadfastly refusing to sing the blues - and recording the well-received albums Peace to the Neighborhood and Father Father in collaboration with admirers such as Ry Cooder and Bonnie Raitt.</p> <p>His wife died in 1987 and he is survived by his children.</p> <p>Roebuck 'Pops' Staples, gospel musician, born December 28 1914; died December 19 2000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is no more recognisable sound in gospel music than the aching harmonies of the Staples Singers, underpinned by the husky murmur and throbbing electric guitar of Roebuck Staples, who has died aged 85. Leading his family group for more than 40 years, he was a pivotal figure in gospel in the 1960s and 70s, when the music gave a vivid voice to both the anger and the aspirations of the African-American community. Staples grew up near Winona, Mississippi, and as a boy was impressed by local blues guitarists such as Charlie Patton, who lived on a neighbouring plantation. \"That sold me on guitar,\" he recalled. \"My greatest ambition was then to play and record.\" It was a dream that he had to defer for some years while he and his wife Oceola brought up their children in Chicago, where they moved in 1935. He worked for the Armour tinned-meat company as a packer and killer and in his spare time sang with a gospel quartet, the Trumpet Jubilees. By his own account he \"didn't touch a guitar for at least 12 years\". The family group of Staples and his four teenage children, Cleotha, Purvis, Yvonne and Mavis, first appeared in public soon after the second world war, singing at neighbourhood churches. In the early 50s they began to be heard on records, first for Leonard Allen's United label, then for the larger Vee-Jay, where they made such unforgettable records as Don't Drive Me Away, This May Be The Last Time - later adapted by the Rolling Stones - and Uncloudy Day. The combination of Staples' tremolo-laden guitar and the wild beauty of Mavis's voice- what the jazz writer Stanley Crouch called \"their joy and thunder\" - was like nothing previously heard in gospel music, and Uncloudy Day sold, as Staples remarked, \"like rock 'n' roll\". In the early 60s the Staples Singers, now with Riverside records, looked for an audience beyond the ghetto, recording coffeehouse favourites such as Cotton Fields, Bob Dylan's Blowin' In The Wind and Woody Guthrie's This Land Is Your Land. Such choices were mildly controversial at the time, but Staples was quick to defend them. \"I think they're good material. I think it's time for the whole nation to start listening to something that means something, and think that this land belongs to everybody. If they would think like that we'd have a better United States.\" A further move in the late 60s to the soul label Stax found the family extending their range still further with aspirational soul material such as Respect Yourself, which won them a gold disc; the hypnotic chant I'll Take You There; and the million-selling If You're Ready (Come Go With Me). Staples also recorded an instrumental blues album, Jammed Together, with fellow guitarists Albert King and Steve Cropper. There were those who regarded these progressive accommodations to the secular music market as betrayals of the traditions the family were supposed to represent. To such accusations Staples succinctly replied, \"Ain't nobody want to go to heaven more than me, but we got to live down here too.\" The Staples Singers worked less after Mavis left to pursue a solo career, but in the 90s \"Pops\" Staples, as he now billed himself, enjoyed a spell of international success away from the family setting, appearing at blues festivals - though steadfastly refusing to sing the blues - and recording the well-received albums Peace to the Neighborhood and Father Father in collaboration with admirers such as Ry Cooder and Bonnie Raitt. His wife died in 1987 and he is survived by his children. Roebuck 'Pops' Staples, gospel musician, born December 28 1914; died December 19 2000.",

He pioneered the study of the 17th century's ancestors of the modern civil service. As a founder member of the University of York, he built up one of the finest schools of history in the country, and was much missed when he left to become master of St Peter's College, Oxford.</p> <p>Gerald's was a strongly individual personality, but he bore something of the stamp of his familial and educational background. It fitted one's first impression of him that his forebears had a long tradition of naval service, and that he had distinguished himself at Winchester and Balliol College, Oxford. In 1944, after just six months at Oxford, he enlisted in the navy, and survived the perils of a wartime convoy to Murmansk. The singer George Melly, one of his shipmates on the lower deck, recalled his \"deep booming voice and magnificent laugh\", his conviviality when ashore, his leftwing sympathies, and his enthusiasm for WH Auden.</p> <p>He retained these characteristics when he returned to Oxford. After getting the expected first, he spent a year at Princeton University before taking up a junior research fellowship at Balliol from 1951-54. His supervisor was RH Tawney, and his doctoral thesis on the institutions and personnel of English central administration under Charles I won such a reputation for the depth and originality of its research that it was widely read before he proceeded to publication. Gerald was a perfectionist, and took six years in refining its 1,180-plus pages down to the shapely book that we know as The King's Servants.</p> <p>Its impact was immediate. It not only charted much little-known territory, but challenged dubious current theories about rising and falling gentry and the supposed divide between court and country. Yet, in criticising the exponents of these, its tone (as in all Gerald's writings) was impeccably courteous and helped to raise historical controversy above the rancorous level to which it had sometimes descended in the immediate postwar years.</p> <p>Bureaucracy may sound a dull subject to non-specialists, but not so in Gerald's hands. His lively interest in human character and his sensitivity to motives and aspirations make his books memorable as portrait galleries, as well as studies of institutions. The King's Servants was followed in 1973 by the The State's Servants, which explores the more difficult territory of the Interregnum with even greater originality. Thereafter, Gerald steadily pushed forward his study of central administration into the post-Restoration world, and he delivered The Crown's Servants to the publishers shortly before his death.</p> <p>This trilogy will be his most lasting monument among fellow scholars, but he himself took his teaching commitments at least as seriously. He taught in the University of Manchester from 1954-62. There he found stimulating colleagues, but chafed at the professorial autocracy which prevailed and at the paucity of personal contact with students. The best thing that happened to him in his Manchester years was the wonderfully happy marriage that he contracted in 1955. He and his wife Ursula became much involved in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and their cider parties for his students are still remembered.</p> <p>His great opportunity came when the University of York appointed him its first professor of history, when he was still only 36. He met the many challenges of the post superbly. He gave a lead to his young and rapidly growing department when it was needed, but ran it as a participatory democracy, holding frequent meetings at which everyone spoke freely and no topics were barred. He had the art of guiding his junior colleagues towards a consensus without resorting to divisive votes, and he encouraged their initiative in devising new courses.</p> <p>Something of his own qualities as a teacher can be gauged from The Struggle for the Constitution, 1603-89, the model text-book that he published in 1963. The same clarity, judiciousness and readability are found again in Rebellion Or Revolution?: England 1640-1660, which is aimed at the general reader no less than the student, while The Levellers in the English Revolution sparkles with clear judgment and warm sympathy. He also co-edited a handsome History Of York Minster, and there were many other publications.</p> <p>On moving to St Peter's, he did not always find the same kindliness and companionability that he had helped to create at York. His period as Master from 1978-91, was not without its trials, which he met with his usual blend of authority and humanity. But he loved Oxford, and continued to teach postgraduate students. He was a great supervisor, and I have not met anyone whose research he guided who was not devoted to him.</p> <p>He was also generous with his time, serving the historical profession on a broader front. He was president of the Royal Historical Society from 1984-88, chairman of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts for the next five years, and he also chaired the History of Parliament's editorial board from 1989-98.</p> <p>Honours came to him steadily. He was elected to the British Academy in 1976, received honorary doctorates from Exeter and Manchester in 1991, and was presented with a festschrift in 1993. But he was a truly modest man, and his fellow scholars and pupils will remember him best for his warmth and friendship and his intuitive understanding of their concerns and problems.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.</p> <p><b> Philip Corrigan writes: </b> Gerald Aylmer was involved in the organisation of a discussion group on English state formation which has met annually at St Peter's College since 1981.

It brought together historians and others, whose focus ranged from the 8th to the 20th centuries.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton has been trying to piece together a comprehensive Middle East peace deal for eight years, but it has remained tantalisingly beyond his grasp. Now he has three weeks for a last attempt to cement his legacy as a statesman. His tetchy remarks yesterday that there was no point in further talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators unless both accepted the basic framework for peace he had laid out reflected what is at stake. A Nobel peace prize would go a long way towards scrubbing away the stain of impeachment. Despite the low expectations, the tune from the White House has been relatively upbeat. A \"senior administration official\" was quoted prominently in yesterday's New York Times as saying that Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, the moderate pillars of the Arab world, had reacted positively to the latest US peace plan. The reaction from President Hosni Mubarak, King Abdullah and King Fahd was as different as \"night to day\" from the cool reception they gave Mr Clinton's compromise proposals at Camp David in July, the official said. There is widespread concern in Israel and the Arab world that when Mr Clinton leaves office on January 20 the Middle East will fall from the top of his agenda to the bottom of George W Bush's. His only foreign policy experience is cross-border talks with Mexico. None of his senior advisers is a Middle East specialist. His secretary of state designate Colin Powell's contacts are almost wholly military.",

It is also considering requiring most league clubs to restrict the sale of away tickets to visiting team's membership clubs. Ministers will propose stricter implementation of laws against racist and sexist remarks at matches. The proposals come in a Home Office report calling for a transformation in the breadth of support for English football so women, children and minorities are no longer alienated. The report, drawn up by a 26-strong group chaired by the Home Office minister Lord Bassam, proposes that tickets for England matches abroad should be diverted away from young, white male hooligans. It claims that a transformation is necessary if the xenophobic image of the England support abroad is to change. It also suggests that uniformed, accredited stewards should travel abroad with fans to liaise with locals and police. Drawn from a pool of existing club stewards, they would have powers to intervene inside and outside grounds. The stewards, who might spot potential troublemakers, would not be presented as an external police force but as a group determined to defend the anti-violent principles of a new England Members Club. The knowledge of the stewards, the report claims, would also help the host police forces to \"distinguish between passionate English followers and potential troublemakers. \"This should help allay a common fear of many sup porters that they run the risk of being arrested simply for being English in the wrong place and at the wrong time.\" The Home Office group of police, football authorities, supporters and members of football club boards, including Delia Smith of Norwich City, has so far rejected the use of British uniformed police or a private security company. A new England Members Club, the report suggests, would require the existing 27,000 members to be vetted again. Clear criteria for expulsion and non-admission would include a criminal record. The report argues that the \"dramatic rehabilitation of the Scotland support occurred as a direct result of fans opting to act in a manner which clearly distinguished them from their menacing and disruptive English counterparts\". There are signs that some big English football clubs playing abroad no longer attract racist support. But this does not extend to some smaller clubs, many of which remain immune to anti-racist campaigns, the group says. The report also finds that many stewards at Premiership clubs are reluctant to act decisively against groups behaving in a racist or offensive manner. \"Unchallenged racist or sexist remarks and threatening behaviour can transform the communal and passionate experience of watching football into a wholly negative and intimidating one for minority community and female supporters.\" The group was set up in the wake of anger at English supporters' behaviour during the Euro 2000 tournament in Belgium and the Netherlands. The government was forced to admit that a massive policing operation for the tournament failed because few of the hooligans who travelled were known to the national criminal intelligence service. Analysis of those arrested revealed that around 42% had previous convictions, many for violent and public order offences, but not necessarily for football-related crimes. The government responded with legislation giving courts powers to ban hooligans from travelling if there are reasonable grounds to believe that would prevent football-related disorder. Euro 2000 confirmed, the report concludes, that the England following \"disproportionately comprises white males aged 20 to 35, some of whom clearly have racist and xenophobic tendencies. \"Many more seem to believe that racist or xenophobic chanting is the appropriate way to demonstrate national pride and support for the English team. \"They appear oblivious to how that behaviour is perceived and then bemused when the host police behave accordingly. \"In many respects the behaviour at England football matches mirrors that demonstrated in high streets every weekend and when on holiday on continental resorts. It is hostile, anti-social and dismissive of all things not stereotypically English.\"",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is embroiled in the UK's biggest dispute over trade union recognition after refusing to allow the ultra-moderate AEEU to represent its cabin crew, it emerged yesterday. The AEEU, headed by Sir Ken Jackson, a pro-business, Blairite trade unionist, has applied to the central arbitration committee, an independent government-backed panel, for recognition under new legislation on the basis that just over half - around 1,400 - of the airline's 2,731 cabin staff have joined the union. The union, which is recognised by airlines such as Go, Airtours, GB Airways, Maersk and Monarch, accuses Sir Richard of being anti-union and of refusing to meet Sir Ken despite repeated requests for a voluntary agreement under the new act - normally granted when a simple majority of staff vote to join a union. But Virgin insisted yesterday that a ballot of all the airline's staff in May had shown an overwhelming rejection of union membership, apart from among pilots whose main union, Balpa, was officially recognised by the company last month. The dispute is the latest blow to Sir Richard, whose People's Lottery failed to win the franchise to run the national lottery earlier this month and whose rail business is reportedly set to lose out in the battle for the franchise to operate the east coast mainline to the incumbent GNER. The AEEU claims to be recruiting scores of Virgin Atlantic cabin crew disgruntled by onerous working conditions and alleged age discrimination as well as by the airline's refusal to disclose the results of its ballot. \"What we are disappointed about is that we have ap proached Virgin three times this year about signing a voluntary agreement under the act but the airline just ignores us,\" union officials said. Roger Maskell, AEEU national officer for airlines, said: \"Virgin should take its head out of the clouds and face reality. The cabin crew want a trade union and we are going to give them a voice. This reminds us of the worst excesses of Thatcherite anti-union behaviour and the company is guilty of double standards by allowing pilots to have a union and refusing the same rights to cabin crew.\" Under the new legislation the revived central arbitration committee will appoint a panel of trade unionists and personnel directors to adjudicate on the AEEU's application for recognition.

Yesterday an Australian writer fed up with rejections for his tale of sex, money and adventure tried a rather more drastic tactic when he landed a motorised paraglider in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.</p> <p>A police helicopter was scrambled to shadow Brett De La Mare's craft as it flew at 25mph over the packed streets of central London, and the city's airports were put on alert.</p> <p>He took off from Hampstead Heath in the north of the capital before rounding the BT Tower in central London and heading for the palace via Trafalgar Square and the Mall. He even managed to fly within yards of New Scotland Yard.</p> <p>Tourists at Buckingham palace watched in amazement as Mr De La Mare brought the paraglider - advertising a website which tells of his desperation to win a publishing deal - to a halt in front of the palace. Armed police and guardsmen pounced.</p> <p>Last night, after being questioned and released on bail, he said he had been ready to do whatever it took to get noticed.</p> <p>\"I thought about getting shot, but the London police are famous for their restraint and their bravery,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The chasing helicopter affected the canopy of my craft, but the pilot backed off when he saw what was happening. I was starting to get frostbite and it was really cold up there.\"</p> <p>Commenting on his treatment by London police, he said: \"They have got a good sense of humour and are very courteous and professional.\"</p> <p>He could be charged under air safety laws and if found guilty could be jailed for up to two years.

      "bodyText": "Authors hungry for publicity usually opt for the mundane and draining round of book fairs, interviews and chat shows. Yesterday an Australian writer fed up with rejections for his tale of sex, money and adventure tried a rather more drastic tactic when he landed a motorised paraglider in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace. A police helicopter was scrambled to shadow Brett De La Mare's craft as it flew at 25mph over the packed streets of central London, and the city's airports were put on alert. He took off from Hampstead Heath in the north of the capital before rounding the BT Tower in central London and heading for the palace via Trafalgar Square and the Mall. He even managed to fly within yards of New Scotland Yard. Tourists at Buckingham palace watched in amazement as Mr De La Mare brought the paraglider - advertising a website which tells of his desperation to win a publishing deal - to a halt in front of the palace. Armed police and guardsmen pounced. Last night, after being questioned and released on bail, he said he had been ready to do whatever it took to get noticed. \"I thought about getting shot, but the London police are famous for their restraint and their bravery,\" he said. \"The chasing helicopter affected the canopy of my craft, but the pilot backed off when he saw what was happening. I was starting to get frostbite and it was really cold up there.\" Commenting on his treatment by London police, he said: \"They have got a good sense of humour and are very courteous and professional.\" He could be charged under air safety laws and if found guilty could be jailed for up to two years. The stunt raises questions about security at Buckingham Palace, although no senior members of the royal family were at home. On his website Mr De La Mare describes himself as a 36-year-old from the Northern Territory in Australia who is on \"a quest to change my life\". He says: \"I've written a book called Canine Dawn and I'm out to get it published. Brother let me tell you, it's been hell. But until it is published I'm prepared to do whatever craziness it takes.\" In October he took off in a paraglider from a field in New Jersey. He headed to Manhattan and flew around the World Trade Centre and above Broadway and Washington Square. But there was a heightened state of security because of demonstrations and helicopters and Swat teams were scrambled when he was seen. Over Central Park his engine cut out; he was arrested and sentenced to community service. He tried to make his 15 minutes pay and managed an appearance on the shock-jock Howard Stern's radio show but was roundly mocked. The New York Times noted: \"All that and still no one had offered to read his novel.\" Mr De La Mare's flatmate, Monica Kelly, a 22-year-old Australian public relations executive, said he had targeted Buckingham Palace for maximum publicity in a last-ditch attempt to find a publisher. He had tried to take off numerous times in recent weeks but had been thwarted by the weather. Then yesterday he launched himself into the sky from Hampstead Heath. She said: \"He had a timber propeller strapped to his back in a metal cage and it sort of motors him along but he has to run to get up into the air.\" An exclusion zone covers the sky above the palace but yesterday's incident was the second time it has been breached.

However, while the mobile phone company's shares fell by almost 2% to 233p, industry analysts insisted that such concerns were overdone. The move in Vodafone's share price followed reports that the company faced litigation in the US from a man who is claiming $800m in damages on the basis that his brain tumour was caused by heavy use of mobile phones. The action on behalf of Christopher Newman is being prepared by Peter Angelos, the Baltimore-based lawyer who played a prominent role in securing billions of dollars of compensation for victims of tobacco-related illnesses. However, Vodafone insisted last night that it was \"not involved nor have we received any brain tumour claims\".

The company would use research to support its case, particularly the recent Stewart report in Britain' which concluded that the balance of evidence did not show there was a link between brain tumours and mobile phone use. Vodafone said yesterday that along with other mobile phone groups it was contributing to the cost of international research into the impact of use.

Many of the problems were in regions with less dense populations. </p> <p>The insurer said the economic losses incurred in 2000 were \u00a320bn, compared with \u00a360bn, with insurance losses accounting for \u00a35bn, compared with \u00a314.5bn the previous year. Munich Re described 2000 as \"a comparatively inexpensive year as far as losses were concerned\". About 10,000 people died, however. </p> <p><strong>De Beers eyes retail move</strong><br> </p> <p>De Beers, the Johannesburg diamond company, is reportedly planning to link with Paris-based luxury goods group LVMH in its first major move in to the retail sector. </p> <p>Until now, De Beers, which refused to comment on the reports yesterday, has concentrated on marketing uncut diamonds rather than selling jewellery directly under its own brand name. </p> <p>De Beers is expected to announce the name of its retail partner before it reports annual results at the end February.</p> <p><strong>Axa buys up Spanish stake</strong><br> </p> <p>French insurer AXA announced last night that it had bought Spanish banking group BBVA's 30% stake in AXA Aurora for \u20ac205m, giving it 100% of its Spanish holding company. </p> <p>Simultaneously, BBVA acquired a 21.4 % stake in Hilo Direct Seguros from AXA Aurora for \u20ac7.5m, meaning the Spanish insurance group is now 50% owned by BBVA and 50% by AXA Aurora. </p> <p><strong>Commerzbank promise</strong></p> <p>Commerzbank, Germany's fourth largest bank, yesterday turned down shareholder demands for an extraordinary general meeting over the recent capital increase which led to reinforced ties with the Italian insurer Generali. </p> <p>However the German bank promised that the issue would be included on the agenda at its annual general meeting which is scheduled to take place in late May.</p>",

Mr Clinton used the estimates, however, to make a case for paying down the federal debt faster and to demonstrate fiscal responsibility. \"I believe, as long as we can do so, we should be shooting for a debt-free America by the end of the decade, because I think that that will strengthen our country enormously.\" The White House budget office projected that the surplus for fiscal years 2001 to the end of 2010 would reach $4.42 trillion under current tax and spending policies, up by more than $200 bn from the figure issued in June. Insurers face \u00a3400m flood bill Insurers may have to pay out \u00a3400m for claims on British property damaged by floods this winter, it was estimated yesterday. Research by German-based insurance group Munich Re concluded that the impact would be less of a burden on the insurance industry than last year, even though the number of disasters was a record in 2000. Many of the problems were in regions with less dense populations. The insurer said the economic losses incurred in 2000 were \u00a320bn, compared with \u00a360bn, with insurance losses accounting for \u00a35bn, compared with \u00a314.5bn the previous year. Munich Re described 2000 as \"a comparatively inexpensive year as far as losses were concerned\". About 10,000 people died, however. De Beers eyes retail move De Beers, the Johannesburg diamond company, is reportedly planning to link with Paris-based luxury goods group LVMH in its first major move in to the retail sector. Until now, De Beers, which refused to comment on the reports yesterday, has concentrated on marketing uncut diamonds rather than selling jewellery directly under its own brand name. De Beers is expected to announce the name of its retail partner before it reports annual results at the end February. Axa buys up Spanish stake French insurer AXA announced last night that it had bought Spanish banking group BBVA's 30% stake in AXA Aurora for \u20ac205m, giving it 100% of its Spanish holding company. Simultaneously, BBVA acquired a 21.4 % stake in Hilo Direct Seguros from AXA Aurora for \u20ac7.5m, meaning the Spanish insurance group is now 50% owned by BBVA and 50% by AXA Aurora. Commerzbank promise Commerzbank, Germany's fourth largest bank, yesterday turned down shareholder demands for an extraordinary general meeting over the recent capital increase which led to reinforced ties with the Italian insurer Generali. However the German bank promised that the issue would be included on the agenda at its annual general meeting which is scheduled to take place in late May.",

For that purpose exists, thank God, the recorded proof of that night's performance. I am taking the opportunity to ask forgiveness of the public, who I love, in case my outburst has upset them.\"",

      "body": "<p>This was the year in which we were going to relaunch the renaissance, and the invention of a new, rationalised British Film Council. Under the stewardship of Alan Parker, it was going to emphasise the importance of commercial viability with a lot more toughness. </p> <p>It is a bit early to tell if this will bear fruit, though British film-making and film-makers have had a lot to feel good about in the past 12 months. But it has become the year in which the British lottery-funded movie became a joke within the industry. </p> <p>There were some real turkeys. Rancid Aluminium was an experience to forget. And BBC Films' Love, Honour and Obey was an abysmal example of the onanist tendency within our new Brit-stars: a film to enclose in a thousand-tonne concrete sarcophagus and sink in the North Sea. </p> <p>There were some sensational Brit successes, too, though: two young British stage directors came up with huge critical and commercial hits, Sam Mendes with his Academy award-winning American Beauty and Stephen Daldry with Billy Elliot. These were fresh, stylish and intelligent pictures - and if not the most wonderful thing since sliced Hovis, they were still real achievements. It was a British director who was responsible for arguably the most exciting English-language film of the year: Christopher Nolan's Memento, an outstanding movie which is playful, yet challenging. </p> <p>Terence Davies's The House of Mirth was a mighty achievement from this great British director: a bold and confident excursion into period drama and proof that Davies can work with a film of classical mass and proportions. But maybe the real success story this year was the cynical unshaven man in the casino: Mike Hodges' Croupier starring Clive Owen - a sleeper hit in the US, which was excluded from this year's Oscars on the technical grounds that it has been shown on TV in Holland. The film was neglected by FilmFour, its original sponsor, and given a limited release by the BFI in 1999 and disappeared with hardly a ripple. But should we have noticed its talent anyway? I'm not sure. Despite Owen's strong performance, Croupier struck me as a little slack. But it is ripe for reappraisal as and when it is re-released here. </p> <p>The American movie scene began the year on terrific form with some excellent examples of films which did not insult everyone's intelligence. Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia and Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich were outstanding. These movies, along with American Beauty and Michael Mann's thriller The Insider, appeared to promise a wave of movie-making with the literacy and elegance which we once expected of the West End stage: a cinema for grown-ups, with well-written scripts and adult performances. This new wave has not really materialised and there seems to be a paucity of classy American product to scoop up next spring's Oscars - although I am hoping that a laurel crown of some sort can be placed on the head of James Gray, director of the excellent thriller The Yards. </p> <p>It wasn't that great a year for the summer movie. Gladiator was tremendous, but apart from that, well - M:i-2, directed by John Woo, was notable only for the opening sequence showing Tom Cruise free-climbing in the outback. X-Men was fun and it is always good to see Ian McKellen. (Why he doesn't get more screen roles since the triumph of Richard III is beyond me.) </p> <p>The real calamity has been children's films. Sorry, but I did not get Chicken Run. It had a certain Oliver Postgate charm, but it was twee, slight, not all that funny and heavily reliant on references to The Great Escape, a movie few of its target audience would ever have heard of.

      "bodyText": "This was the year in which we were going to relaunch the renaissance, and the invention of a new, rationalised British Film Council. Under the stewardship of Alan Parker, it was going to emphasise the importance of commercial viability with a lot more toughness. It is a bit early to tell if this will bear fruit, though British film-making and film-makers have had a lot to feel good about in the past 12 months. But it has become the year in which the British lottery-funded movie became a joke within the industry. There were some real turkeys. Rancid Aluminium was an experience to forget. And BBC Films' Love, Honour and Obey was an abysmal example of the onanist tendency within our new Brit-stars: a film to enclose in a thousand-tonne concrete sarcophagus and sink in the North Sea. There were some sensational Brit successes, too, though: two young British stage directors came up with huge critical and commercial hits, Sam Mendes with his Academy award-winning American Beauty and Stephen Daldry with Billy Elliot. These were fresh, stylish and intelligent pictures - and if not the most wonderful thing since sliced Hovis, they were still real achievements. It was a British director who was responsible for arguably the most exciting English-language film of the year: Christopher Nolan's Memento, an outstanding movie which is playful, yet challenging. Terence Davies's The House of Mirth was a mighty achievement from this great British director: a bold and confident excursion into period drama and proof that Davies can work with a film of classical mass and proportions. But maybe the real success story this year was the cynical unshaven man in the casino: Mike Hodges' Croupier starring Clive Owen - a sleeper hit in the US, which was excluded from this year's Oscars on the technical grounds that it has been shown on TV in Holland. The film was neglected by FilmFour, its original sponsor, and given a limited release by the BFI in 1999 and disappeared with hardly a ripple. But should we have noticed its talent anyway? I'm not sure. Despite Owen's strong performance, Croupier struck me as a little slack. But it is ripe for reappraisal as and when it is re-released here. The American movie scene began the year on terrific form with some excellent examples of films which did not insult everyone's intelligence. Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia and Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich were outstanding. These movies, along with American Beauty and Michael Mann's thriller The Insider, appeared to promise a wave of movie-making with the literacy and elegance which we once expected of the West End stage: a cinema for grown-ups, with well-written scripts and adult performances. This new wave has not really materialised and there seems to be a paucity of classy American product to scoop up next spring's Oscars - although I am hoping that a laurel crown of some sort can be placed on the head of James Gray, director of the excellent thriller The Yards. It wasn't that great a year for the summer movie. Gladiator was tremendous, but apart from that, well - M:i-2, directed by John Woo, was notable only for the opening sequence showing Tom Cruise free-climbing in the outback. X-Men was fun and it is always good to see Ian McKellen. (Why he doesn't get more screen roles since the triumph of Richard III is beyond me.) The real calamity has been children's films. Sorry, but I did not get Chicken Run. It had a certain Oliver Postgate charm, but it was twee, slight, not all that funny and heavily reliant on references to The Great Escape, a movie few of its target audience would ever have heard of. Elsewhere, 102 Dalmatians was dull and charmless and The Grinch, though having some nice lines for Jim Carrey, was too icky for words. The only real triumph was the magnificent Toy Story 2 which has, happily, come out on DVD. The French have given us some of the best movies of 2000. I have already exhausted my praise of the Dardenne brothers' Rosetta, the Cannes Palme d'Or winner.

We have been lucky in seeing some really brilliant Iranian movies: Abbas Kiarostami's The Wind Will Carry Us was sublime and enigmatic and Majid Majidi's Children of Heaven was a lovely, pellucid and charming film with terrific child performances. At the very end of this year, we are to see Blackboards, a remarkable film from the 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf.

He didn't have a whole lot to do as the third member of the band of chain-gang escapees in O Brother, Where Art Thou? other than point his goofy face at the camera. But Nelson's buck-toothed visage hides an active career as a playwright and director that looks set to flower in 2001. Early in the year, his high school-set adaptation of Othello, O, will be released. Campus retreads of the classics may be less than novel these days, but Nelson will show himself a heavyweight with his subsequent film, The Grey Zone, based on his own play about the moral \"grey zone\" occupied by Sonderkommandos - the Jews who staffed death-camp crematoria. Starring Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro and Mira Sorvino, the film was shot in a replica of Auschwitz built near a Bulgarian village. </p> <p><b> Kate Beckinsale </b> will become the paparazzi's darling in 2001. Item A: she secured the lead female role - a nurse for whom navy flyer Ben Affleck has the hots - in Pearl Harbor, scheduled for global box office domination in summer. Item B: she's cast alongside John Cusack in Serendipity, playing one half of a couple convinced, after 10 years apart, that they're meant for each other. </p> <p><b> Daniel Radcliffe</b> is currently anonymous but by autumn the 12-year-old will be known to millions as the face of Harry Potter. Potter author JK Rowling held out for a British lead and got her way. Radcliffe, whose tiny CV includes the younger half of the lead role in the BBC's recent David Copperfield, can expect his face to be plastered over every billboard from here to Hong Kong. Let's just pray he doesn't turn out like Drew Barrymore. <br><b>Andrew Pulver </b><br> </p> <p> <b> Sport</b><br> </p> <p> This year <b> Mark Lewis-Francis</b> blossomed from brilliant prospect to world-class sprinter - and entered the history books. A run of 10.10 seconds at the British Grand Prix in August made him the fastest 17-year-old ever. It also ensured Olympic qualification. But, having set his sights on the world junior championships, he went to Santiago rather than Sydney. He took gold in the 100m and, as anchor in the relay, closed a 4m gap to seize victory in a time just 0.05 seconds off a world record. He's beaten some of the best in Britain. Next year he can set his sights on the best in the world. </p> <p>Tranmere's 21-year-old midfielder <b> Jason Koumas</b> has put an inconsistent past behind him to leave Premiership scouts slavering this season with performances that have proved his skill, vision, finishing and sheer class. He could play for England, Cyprus or Wales, and has already been approached by the last. Should his form continue, his decision to keep his options open will not seem so over-optimistic. He will have to prove himself in the Premiership before the England call comes - but he may not have to wait long. <br><b> Simon Burnton </b><br> </p> <p> <b> Television</b> <br> </p> <p> Of the host of hosts hoping to go stellar in 2001, there are none more promising than <b> Emma Kennedy</b> and <b> Christopher Price</b>. Kennedy is the better known, having fronted The Real Holiday Show and Flatmates for Channel 4. She currently presents Soap Fever on ITV2 and, with her irreverent, sharp style, makes her job look easy while gently undermining the notion of a serious, authoritative presenter. An ex-solicitor, she has also appeared in comedies from Radio 4's excellent The Sunday Format to BBC2's People Like Us and Goodness Gracious Me. </p> <p>While not a TV hunk in the Dermot O'Leary mould, Price presents Liquid News on BBC Choice and has already been earmarked as a \"face\" of the channel by controller Stuart Murphy. If that channel becomes BBC3, you'll be seeing a lot more of 33-year-old Price and his cheeky, catty, campish antics. <br><b> Gareth McLean </b><br></p> <p> <b> Fashion </b> <br></p> <p> If <b> Hedi Slimane</b> has his way, 2001 will be the year that men change the way they dress. Previously the menswear designer at Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, 32-year-old Slimane is now preparing his first collection for Christian Dior Homme. In the normally sleepy world of menswear, this is major news - most men's collections are shadows of the womenswear lines. Dior currently has no high-fashion menswear line so Slimane has a blank canvas (plus the mighty financial support of owners LVMH) to shake up a stagnating branch of fashion. </p> <p>In Japan, Yohji Yamamoto is still going strong - and has allowed his 26-year-old daughter <b> Limi Yamamoto</b> into the spotlight as a designer. She is responsible for bringing some youthful energy back into the company, working on the mid-price lines to produce edgy, colourful yet functional separates. Insiders suggest she may be in line to take over the Yamamoto crown. <br><b> Charlie Porter </b><br> </p> <p> <b> Pop </b><br></p> <p><b> I Am Kloot</b> is the sort of dire indie-joker name you'd expect to see third on the bill at the Pottley-on-the-Beedle civic centre. It conjures a dismal image of quirky types who think singing about asparagus is amusing and that pretending to be Jimi Hendrix is enough to persuade people of your non-existent guitar skills. Thankfully, I Am Kloot live up to none of these visions. Their brooding, off-kilter take on smoky, cabaret-theatrical guitar-pop has been one of this year's major discoveries, and in Johnny Bramwell they have a frontman whose twisted way with a lyric and distinctive Mancunian yowl puts the likes of Liam Gallagher in the bog peats where they belong. If their debut album Natural History, due in May, doesn't fly off the shelves at HMV, there's no justice in the world.<br><b> Maddy Costa </b><br></p> <p> <b> Theatre</b> <br></p> <p> It's not difficult to predict a bright future for director <b> Loveday Ingram</b>. This year she directed Pal Joey, The Blue Room and Terry Johnson's Hysteria at Chichester's Minerva Studio, and supervised the revival of The Messiah at the Bush. But who is Loveday Ingram? She was John Barton's research assistant at the RSC. She has worked as a staff director at the National. And she's also bobbed and weaved around the London fringe turning up at the Gate, BAC and the White Bear. I recall seeing her do a Spanish classic, Lost In a Mirror, at Battersea and investing it with a dark, baroque stylishness. </p> <p>It is her recent work in the Chichester studio, however, that has marked her out as a name to watch: Pal Joey, in particular, caught the acid wit of Hart's lyrics and hit below the belt even more effectively than Hare's cyclical bed-hopper. Like all good directors, Ingram makes text and image work in unison. I see no reason why she shouldn't scale the heights. <br><b> Michael Billington </b><br></p> <p> <b> Art</b> <br></p> <p> At the age of 33, <b> Mike Nelson</b> is one of the most interesting and promising British artists around. His installations are fictions made real: an abandoned room clawed to shreds by some frantic being; a sinister, backwoods trapper's camp relocated to the gallery; a maze of interconnecting waiting rooms, go-downs and cab shacks from the seamier, sweatier corners of the world. This last, Coral Reef, at Matt's Gallery, was one of the highlights of 2000. Nelson's work makes you feel you've strayed into the wrong part of town, or into one of the hairier moments in a novel by Timothy Mo or Robert Wilson. In 2001, Nelson will be constructing major, sweaty-palmed works for the forthcoming Venice Biennale and, in the autumn, at London's ICA. </p> <p><b> Eija-Liisa Ahtila</b> won the first Vincent - a sort of Euro-Turner - in Maastricht this year. Like Nelson, she creates fictions. Storytelling is the big thing in art right now. Her film installations are dissections of relationships, dynamic stagings of love affairs, family romances, the knots we get ourselves into. Touching, funny, moving - her work takes film to a place mainstream movies have largely forsaken, and which installation art has been fumbling towards. She gives me emotional vertigo. This is art for grown-ups, and Ahtila will be at Tate Modern in September. <br><b> Adrian Searle </b><br> </p> <p> <b> Books</b> <br> </p> <p> It doesn't hurt to have the right kind of people on your side. In the case of <b> David Mitchell</b>, it was the grande dame of letters, AS Byatt. So impressed was she by his debut novel, Ghostwritten, that she asked to share a platform with him at a literary festival - and her enthusiasm was matched by the book's highly favourable critical reception and, for a first novel at least, pretty good sales. </p> <p>In March, publishers Sceptre will launch Mitchell's follow-up, the weirdly titled Number9dream, which concerns the efforts of a hapless and mapless Japanese teenager to find his missing father in a sprawling city. Mitchell's themes of chance, strange coincidence and the unexpected effects of human chaos theory will no doubt come to the fore once again - and could prove the winning formula for a literary breakthrough. <br><b> Alex Clark </b><br></p> <p> <b> Politics</b> <br></p> <p> Let us look to the (by political standards) teeny generation, those MPs in their late 20s and early 30s who recognise a world in which politics is no longer central to voters' concerns except on election day. <b> Charles Kennedy</b>, now Lib Dem leader, gets that point even though he is 41. Don't sell your shares unless he ploughs the coming election. He understands the importance of \"soft media\" and is all too clearly a member of the human race. He may even marry shortly. </p> <p>Labour's <b> Yvette Cooper</b> is young, 31, and already a junior minister. Equally impressive <b> Ruth Kelly</b> (ex-Guardian) is a whole year older, but has had two children since being elected in 1997 compared with Cooper's one. <b> Oonagh King</b> and <b> David Lammy</b>, both Labour MPs for London and both black, are even younger. </p> <p>There is also <b> AN Other</b>, that young dark horse who may still be at university, redbrick as likely as Oxbridge. Smart, media-savvy, watching carefully from a job in the \"professional politics\" trades of media, lobbying, or a think tank, he or she may fight a hopeless seat in the coming election. After all, at the Beaconsfield byelection, at the nadir of Labour's postwar fortunes, Michael Foot met the Labour candidate fighting a hopeless seat - and tipped him for glory. Big cheesy grin, name of Blair. <br><b> Michael White </b></p>",

Previously the menswear designer at Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, 32-year-old Slimane is now preparing his first collection for Christian Dior Homme. In the normally sleepy world of menswear, this is major news - most men's collections are shadows of the womenswear lines. Dior currently has no high-fashion menswear line so Slimane has a blank canvas (plus the mighty financial support of owners LVMH) to shake up a stagnating branch of fashion. In Japan, Yohji Yamamoto is still going strong - and has allowed his 26-year-old daughter Limi Yamamoto into the spotlight as a designer. She is responsible for bringing some youthful energy back into the company, working on the mid-price lines to produce edgy, colourful yet functional separates. Insiders suggest she may be in line to take over the Yamamoto crown. Charlie Porter Pop I Am Kloot is the sort of dire indie-joker name you'd expect to see third on the bill at the Pottley-on-the-Beedle civic centre. It conjures a dismal image of quirky types who think singing about asparagus is amusing and that pretending to be Jimi Hendrix is enough to persuade people of your non-existent guitar skills. Thankfully, I Am Kloot live up to none of these visions. Their brooding, off-kilter take on smoky, cabaret-theatrical guitar-pop has been one of this year's major discoveries, and in Johnny Bramwell they have a frontman whose twisted way with a lyric and distinctive Mancunian yowl puts the likes of Liam Gallagher in the bog peats where they belong. If their debut album Natural History, due in May, doesn't fly off the shelves at HMV, there's no justice in the world. Maddy Costa Theatre It's not difficult to predict a bright future for director Loveday Ingram. This year she directed Pal Joey, The Blue Room and Terry Johnson's Hysteria at Chichester's Minerva Studio, and supervised the revival of The Messiah at the Bush. But who is Loveday Ingram? She was John Barton's research assistant at the RSC. She has worked as a staff director at the National. And she's also bobbed and weaved around the London fringe turning up at the Gate, BAC and the White Bear. I recall seeing her do a Spanish classic, Lost In a Mirror, at Battersea and investing it with a dark, baroque stylishness. It is her recent work in the Chichester studio, however, that has marked her out as a name to watch: Pal Joey, in particular, caught the acid wit of Hart's lyrics and hit below the belt even more effectively than Hare's cyclical bed-hopper. Like all good directors, Ingram makes text and image work in unison. I see no reason why she shouldn't scale the heights. Michael Billington Art At the age of 33, Mike Nelson is one of the most interesting and promising British artists around. His installations are fictions made real: an abandoned room clawed to shreds by some frantic being; a sinister, backwoods trapper's camp relocated to the gallery; a maze of interconnecting waiting rooms, go-downs and cab shacks from the seamier, sweatier corners of the world. This last, Coral Reef, at Matt's Gallery, was one of the highlights of 2000. Nelson's work makes you feel you've strayed into the wrong part of town, or into one of the hairier moments in a novel by Timothy Mo or Robert Wilson. In 2001, Nelson will be constructing major, sweaty-palmed works for the forthcoming Venice Biennale and, in the autumn, at London's ICA. Eija-Liisa Ahtila won the first Vincent - a sort of Euro-Turner - in Maastricht this year. Like Nelson, she creates fictions. Storytelling is the big thing in art right now. Her film installations are dissections of relationships, dynamic stagings of love affairs, family romances, the knots we get ourselves into. Touching, funny, moving - her work takes film to a place mainstream movies have largely forsaken, and which installation art has been fumbling towards. She gives me emotional vertigo. This is art for grown-ups, and Ahtila will be at Tate Modern in September. Adrian Searle Books It doesn't hurt to have the right kind of people on your side. In the case of David Mitchell, it was the grande dame of letters, AS Byatt. So impressed was she by his debut novel, Ghostwritten, that she asked to share a platform with him at a literary festival - and her enthusiasm was matched by the book's highly favourable critical reception and, for a first novel at least, pretty good sales. In March, publishers Sceptre will launch Mitchell's follow-up, the weirdly titled Number9dream, which concerns the efforts of a hapless and mapless Japanese teenager to find his missing father in a sprawling city. Mitchell's themes of chance, strange coincidence and the unexpected effects of human chaos theory will no doubt come to the fore once again - and could prove the winning formula for a literary breakthrough. Alex Clark Politics Let us look to the (by political standards) teeny generation, those MPs in their late 20s and early 30s who recognise a world in which politics is no longer central to voters' concerns except on election day. Charles Kennedy, now Lib Dem leader, gets that point even though he is 41. Don't sell your shares unless he ploughs the coming election. He understands the importance of \"soft media\" and is all too clearly a member of the human race. He may even marry shortly. Labour's Yvette Cooper is young, 31, and already a junior minister. Equally impressive Ruth Kelly (ex-Guardian) is a whole year older, but has had two children since being elected in 1997 compared with Cooper's one. Oonagh King and David Lammy, both Labour MPs for London and both black, are even younger. There is also AN Other, that young dark horse who may still be at university, redbrick as likely as Oxbridge. Smart, media-savvy, watching carefully from a job in the \"professional politics\" trades of media, lobbying, or a think tank, he or she may fight a hopeless seat in the coming election. After all, at the Beaconsfield byelection, at the nadir of Labour's postwar fortunes, Michael Foot met the Labour candidate fighting a hopeless seat - and tipped him for glory. Big cheesy grin, name of Blair. Michael White",

Indeed, a swift straw poll of one particular average-ish social group of early 30-somethings revealed that equal numbers of men and women had concocted lists of resolutions, and that essentially they revolved around the same issues - weight loss (which the men tended to couch as a programme of healthier eating and minimal boozing, and the women as detoxing, the politically correct option on dieting), financial affairs and smoking. All of those surveyed admitted that they would be enormously surprised if they stuck by their pledge.</p> <p>So, assuming we are not going to abandon the notion of the new year resolution, assuming we're going to cling to the practice, is there a way of reinventing it as a less destructive business? Kathleen Cox, a chartered clinical psychologist who works on the nature of change and has researched the psychology of the new year resolution, is convinced that they can be a positive business, but only if we first ditch this idea that they are bound to fail - the very notion that makes them so harmful, and us so maladjusted in making them in the first place.</p> <p>\"It is, after all, appropriate to change,\" she explains, adding that now is a good time to do it because the symbolism of the new year could well work in your favour, and because you will have a support system of others trying to change simultaneously. \"You also don't have to be that fundamentally dissatisfied with yourself to want to change, either. Overcome that nebulous desire to change, and work out exactly why you're doing it. Don't make a resolution on a whim at midnight. Sit down and think it through carefully. Understand your motive for change, and build in spin-off advantages. For example, if you decide you're going to stop smoking, don't just think, in a nebulous way: it'll make me healthier. Work out how much money it'll save you a week, then actually look at that amount of money. Take it out of your bank account and look at it.\"</p> <p>Cox feels that we suffer from an all-or-nothing approach to the resolution, and that if we could get over being so high-handed with ourselves, giving our psyches such stern ultimatums, we might find we're more successful. \"If you have one cigarette, just think: well, that's one cigarette.\" In short, don't see it as the symbolic end of your fag-free period.</p> <p>\"Go public on your resolution,\" she adds. \" Amour-propre should help you stick to it, rather than lose face by faltering publicly.\"</p> <p>Cox does, however, believe there could be a more appropriate time to start losing weight. \"It's the middle of the winter. We're craving stodgy food. It might well be better to wait until the summer.\"</p> <p>But maybe the key to achieving a positive new year resolution experience lies in looking beyond the traditional domains of fat loss, spiritual reinvention, finances and fags. Maybe we should be casting about for new resolution types, and using them to establish a framework of rules that cuts out day-to-day tedium. Decide that you will no longer be bamboozled by door-to-door salesmen peddling digital TV or cut-price gas deals, that you will walk out of films the moment you realise they are irrevocably bad, because life is simply too short, that you will not allow yourself to be put on hold for more than five minutes at a time by your mobile phone company, that kind of thing. Maybe that way, we can spin the new year resolution list into a pledge for a nicer life, rather than a lament for all that we aren't and will never be.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ritual, wrote Wittgenstein, \"is permissible only to the extent that it is as genuine as a kiss\". We no longer really bother with rituals in this era of air kissing; we prefer just to follow routines.</p> <p>It was very different a century ago. The Victorians took their rituals seriously, using them to ward off the burgeoning uncertainties of the fin de si\u00e8cle years, nourish old roots and imply the presence of others that had never existed. The whole Christmas period, for instance, was built up to help keep harsh modernity at bay. Each year the festivities grew more elaborate and more forced, combining themes and traditions revived (such as carols, yule logs, wassail bowls and mummers' plays) and invented (such as fir trees, cards, crackers, Santa Claus and snow) to summon up warm feelings of comfort and constancy.</p> <p>Each December 31 was seized on as an opportunity to reassure everyone that stability and cohesion came through ritual, and that, in spite of all the dark talk of decay and disintegration, there would still be growth and renewal. New Year's Eve 1900, however, was celebrated more soberly than usual, because even the obdurate Victorians had to acknowledge that its arrival heralded the end of a century of familiarity and the start of a new one of inscrutable originality.</p> <p>The evening, according to many contemporary accounts, was a little quieter than usual, as if the air of heightened expectancy had acted as a distraction from the immediate activities, but as the final hour arrived the streets began to fill with those who wished to witness the last midnight of the century.</p> <p>\"No spectacle attracted the throng,\" reported the Manchester Guardian of a typical city scene, before admitting that, in a way, there had been a kind of spectacle: the great clock of the town hall. \"Yes,\" the paper observed, \"the clock was the thing. A steady stream of thought flowed upwards through the gloom to where the bells were jangling, hammering, beating, chasing echoes abroad over the city; the small noises of the people were obliterated by the metallic clatter and the resultant strife of harmonies and over-tones in the air; time, who as a rule slips by us almost disregarded, was passing in a pageant of savage music, and dominating for once the expectant crowd.\"</p> <p>Some people danced, some sang, some played on mouth organs, accordions or penny whistles, some \"gulped and shuddered over raw and nauseous spirits under a vague impression that a crisis was approaching for which they needed to be strung up\", while others looked on in silence.</p> <p>\"The bells ceased ringing some minutes before twelve,\" the report continued, \"and these last minutes were long. They were tasted and examined separately, held close before the eyes, as it were, and magnified.\" Finally, the two hands of the clock came together. \"A deep note swelled and filled the air with mellow thunder. The crowd stood for a moment irresolute, as though waiting for some great outward thing to happen, and forgetting to look inwards for its sensation. But in a second or two the people broke out in cries that seemed feeble enough beneath the now ear-splitting cannonade of the bells.\"</p> <p>After a brief shared embrace, they looked back up at the clock to see that the great moment had passed. \"The old scroll was rolled up, then, and the new one opened fair and clean and - uninteresting.\" The mood changed, the crowd dispersed, \"and the drama of the clock went on in an empty theatre.\" The 20th century had begun.</p> <p>It seems unlikely that December 31 2000 will witness similar scenes of wonderment. If the Victorians invested time with too much significance then we invest it with too little; they made it seem remarkable, we make it seem banal. Endless mechanical replays have dulled our senses; half-forgotten childhoods can now be recalled at the flick of a switch, and the old acts of remembrance and anticipation no longer mean as much. Too cynical for rituals, too lazy to break with routines, we just go on, without fear, or hope, or wonder. Happy New Year? Whatever.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ritual, wrote Wittgenstein, \"is permissible only to the extent that it is as genuine as a kiss\". We no longer really bother with rituals in this era of air kissing; we prefer just to follow routines. It was very different a century ago. The Victorians took their rituals seriously, using them to ward off the burgeoning uncertainties of the fin de si\u00e8cle years, nourish old roots and imply the presence of others that had never existed. The whole Christmas period, for instance, was built up to help keep harsh modernity at bay. Each year the festivities grew more elaborate and more forced, combining themes and traditions revived (such as carols, yule logs, wassail bowls and mummers' plays) and invented (such as fir trees, cards, crackers, Santa Claus and snow) to summon up warm feelings of comfort and constancy. Each December 31 was seized on as an opportunity to reassure everyone that stability and cohesion came through ritual, and that, in spite of all the dark talk of decay and disintegration, there would still be growth and renewal. New Year's Eve 1900, however, was celebrated more soberly than usual, because even the obdurate Victorians had to acknowledge that its arrival heralded the end of a century of familiarity and the start of a new one of inscrutable originality. The evening, according to many contemporary accounts, was a little quieter than usual, as if the air of heightened expectancy had acted as a distraction from the immediate activities, but as the final hour arrived the streets began to fill with those who wished to witness the last midnight of the century. \"No spectacle attracted the throng,\" reported the Manchester Guardian of a typical city scene, before admitting that, in a way, there had been a kind of spectacle: the great clock of the town hall. \"Yes,\" the paper observed, \"the clock was the thing. A steady stream of thought flowed upwards through the gloom to where the bells were jangling, hammering, beating, chasing echoes abroad over the city; the small noises of the people were obliterated by the metallic clatter and the resultant strife of harmonies and over-tones in the air; time, who as a rule slips by us almost disregarded, was passing in a pageant of savage music, and dominating for once the expectant crowd.\" Some people danced, some sang, some played on mouth organs, accordions or penny whistles, some \"gulped and shuddered over raw and nauseous spirits under a vague impression that a crisis was approaching for which they needed to be strung up\", while others looked on in silence. \"The bells ceased ringing some minutes before twelve,\" the report continued, \"and these last minutes were long. They were tasted and examined separately, held close before the eyes, as it were, and magnified.\" Finally, the two hands of the clock came together. \"A deep note swelled and filled the air with mellow thunder. The crowd stood for a moment irresolute, as though waiting for some great outward thing to happen, and forgetting to look inwards for its sensation. But in a second or two the people broke out in cries that seemed feeble enough beneath the now ear-splitting cannonade of the bells.\" After a brief shared embrace, they looked back up at the clock to see that the great moment had passed. \"The old scroll was rolled up, then, and the new one opened fair and clean and - uninteresting.\" The mood changed, the crowd dispersed, \"and the drama of the clock went on in an empty theatre.\" The 20th century had begun. It seems unlikely that December 31 2000 will witness similar scenes of wonderment. If the Victorians invested time with too much significance then we invest it with too little; they made it seem remarkable, we make it seem banal. Endless mechanical replays have dulled our senses; half-forgotten childhoods can now be recalled at the flick of a switch, and the old acts of remembrance and anticipation no longer mean as much. Too cynical for rituals, too lazy to break with routines, we just go on, without fear, or hope, or wonder. Happy New Year? Whatever.",

      "body": "<p>At the beginning of the last century, near the end of his tragically short life, James Elroy Flecker addressed these words \"to a poet a thousand years hence\": <br></p> <p> I care not if you bridge the seas, <br></p> <p>Or ride secure the cruel sky, <br></p> <p>Or build consummate palaces <br></p> <p>Of metal or of masonry. <br></p> <p>Well, we may not have bridged the seas, but millions now ride secure the cruel sky. And how astonished Flecker would have been to know that, a mere half-century after his death, men were preparing to go to the moon. </p> <p>That alone should prove how futile it is to attempt predictions about the world even a few decades ahead, let alone in the year 3001. For how successful would a survivor of the battle of Hastings - the only date most British people remember from their school days - have been, had he been asked to describe how we would be living nearly a millennium later? </p> <p>Even two centuries ago that would have been an impossible task because virtually everything that shapes the modern world has been invented - or discovered - since 1800. And now with the arrival of the microchip - the most important invention since the wheel - we are faced with another major discontinuity. </p> <p>But first let us consider a rather fundamental question, not as ridiculous as it may seem. Will Britain still exist in the year 3001? I don't mean politically - I mean physically. One thing is certain: the British Isles won't be where they are now. Plate tectonics (aka continental drift) will have moved them approximately 20 metres eastwards. </p> <p>But that is the most favourable scenario, for it has only recently been realised that we live in a dangerous universe. There were four major asteroid or comet impacts in the past century, luckily in uninhabited parts of the globe. In September, the Earth had a near-miss from an asteroid 500 metres wide; if the rock had hit, the explosion would have been millions of times as powerful as the atom bomb over Hiroshima. The scarred face of our next-door neighbour, the moon, shows how frequent collisions have been in the past. </p> <p>And these are not the only nasty surprises Mother Nature could spring on us. If a couple of neutron stars collide within a few thousand light years of the solar system, the resulting blast of x-rays and gamma rays could be lethal to all forms of life except those in the deep ocean. </p> <p>Of course, whether such catastrophes are a good or a bad thing depends on one's point of view. If the Earth had not received a major hammer blow from space some 65m years ago, an unpretentious little rodent-like creature might never have had a chance of going on to greater things. One of my colleagues put it in a nutshell when he said: \"The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space programme.\" </p> <p>Nor, to be honest, do we have much of a space programme at the moment: our current ventures beyond the atmosphere will one day look like early 19th-century attempts at ballooning. In fact, that is a good analogy, because the rocket may play exactly the same role in space exploration as the balloon did in the conquest of the air. It is only a matter of time - I trust not more than a few decades - before we have safe and economical space propulsion systems, depending on new principles of physics that are now being discussed by far-sighted engineers and scientists. Nasa has established an Institute for Advanced Concepts to look into such matters. </p> <p>It is not generally realised that space travel requires only trivial amounts of energy compared with jet flight in the Earth's atmosphere. The awesome power and violence of a Saturn V launch, where thousands of tons of fuel were required to take three men to the moon, is a spectacular proof of our current incompetence. When we know how to do it efficiently, the main expenses of space travel will be catering and in-flight movies. (Passengers cannot be expected to spend all their time looking at the stars, or reading that popular guide to zero-gee, the Nasa Sutra.) </p> <p>So the exploration - and later exploitation - of the solar system will be the main business of the next millennium. In 2003 alone, two probes will land on Mars, sent by Nasa and the European Space Agency. The possibilities range from robot observers (assuming lessons are learnt from the loss of Nasa's Mars Polar Lander last year) to small groups of scientists studying their environment (as they now do in Antarctica) all the way to self-sufficient colonies and, still within this time frame, the modification of many planetary environments to make them suitable for human habitation. </p> <p>And will we see the patterns of terrestrial politics repeated on an astronomical stage? It is naive to expect close parallels: any attempts by lunar or Martian colonists to achieve independence from the mother world are likely to be cultural and economic, rather than military. Yet, homo sapiens being such an obnoxious species, it is not safe to rule out the last possibility. There have been some hair-raising suggestions that asteroids, given a gentle nudge in the right direction, might be used as instruments of cosmic blackmail. This makes it all the more important that we spread over the solar system as quickly as possible: we have too many eggs in one fragile basket, here on this small blue dot. </p> <p>And in 1,000 years we will surely have done much more than that. Even if our travels round the universe are always limited by the velocity of light, that still puts many star systems within reach during a human lifetime. One of the most striking discoveries of the past decade has been the identification of planets around other suns. Only a few weeks ago, astronomers in Australia discovered three more planets, the closest just 50 light years from us. </p> <p>This enhances the prospect of what may be the greatest single event in future history - contact with other civilisations, either directly or through radio transmission. Many scared by the flood of \"invasion of Earth\" movies such as Mars Attacks! or Independence Day would prefer only long-distance phone calls (preferably with the charges reversed). However, despite the claims of pessimists, physical contact is perfectly possible, and requires no technologies much more advanced than those we can imagine today. So, long before the end of the millennium, we may be plugged into the galactic internet, downloading vast libraries from countless alien cultures. The impact on our philosophies, religions and self-esteem as a species could be overwhelming. </p> <p>Few of the superstitions we have inherited from our tribal ancestors could survive the revelations that would came from space. I would like to think that in the enormous databank of some ancient civilisation are records of the formation of our solar system - perhaps even of the galaxy. How many times in the past ages have exploring entities come this way, made the appropriate entries in their logs, and travelled onwards in the quest for knowledge, which must surely be part of the make-up of any intelligent species? </p> <p>But let us return to Flecker. In his third verse he asked his unknowable friend in the far future: </p> <p> Have you wine and music still, <br></p> <p>And statues and a bright-eyed love, <br></p> <p>And foolish thoughts of good and ill. <br></p> <p>And prayers to them who sit above? <br></p> <p> What Flecker was really wondering was: will we still be human 1,000 years from now? In some ways, I certainly hope not. As the famous anthropologist Konrad Lorenz once remarked: \"I've found the link between apes and civilised men - it's us.\" </p> <p>Even if we are civilised 1,000 years from now, will we be the dominant species on Earth? Many studies suggest that, some time this century, machine intelligence may exceed man's. From that point onwards, the purely human era will have ceased - for better or for worse. We will be sharing our planet with at least one other intelligent species - perhaps several. </p> <p>And what will happen to the arts in that post-human era? Surely music will continue, though whether it will progress is another matter. Constant Lambert's entertaining tirade, Music Ho! A Study of Music in Decline, may have been a trifle premature when it was published in 1934, (yes, 1934) but I wonder what he would have said about the eructations that all too frequently emerge when I switch on my radio. Technically, we can now create any possible sound, as well as many that ought not to be possible. Are there any melodies still undiscovered, and will all the future ages ever produce anything to match Greensleeves or the Toccata and Fugue in D? </p> <p>The 20th century saw the rise of a new art form that would have seemed miraculous to our ancestors - film. It is difficult not to feel, when immersed in some wide-screen 3-D multi-stereo epic, that here again technological finality has been reached. Not at all: the next stage will undoubtedly be input of sense impressions directly into the brain, bypassing the eyes, ears, and other input/output devices nature has given us. </p> <p>Huxley's Brave New World's \"feelies\" merely hinted at this back in 1932, and the spectre of the \"dream machine\" has horrified and fascinated science fiction writers ever since. Today's couch potatoes, occasionally twitching in front of their new DVD players, may seem like athletes compared with their totally immobile successors in their electronic sarcophagi. </p> <p>It may well be argued that Britain's greatest contribution to the arts is the English language. (Yes, I know there were minor donations from the continent.) And in his penultimate verse, Flecker addressed his friend unseen as a student of \"our sweet English tongue\", implying this may be a rather specialised occupation a millennium from now. However - and here I am sticking my neck out, though without too much fear of contradiction - I suspect that even more people will be speaking English 1,000 years from now than are doing so today. </p> <p>Equally important, we would be able to understand them, as perhaps we could not English-speakers 500 years ago. The advent of sound recording may have frozen pronunciation, though of course our descendants will have vocabularies that would often baffle us. It's an amusing game to make lists of words or phrases that would have been utterly meaningless only a generation ago. My favourite example: how would anyone before 1970 have realised that, at the beginning of the 21st century, millions would spend a major part of their working day fondling a mouse? </p> <p>Yet if English survives as a language, will there be any vestige of the United Kingdom as a political entity 1,000 years from now? I very much doubt it will have another century of existence. The nation state was already dissolving before the internet gave it the final death blow. </p> <p>But the future's most awesome possibility is this - that some people alive today may witness the year 3001. This may be through the achievement of biological immortality, \"downloading\" the mind into another carrier (probably inorganic) or suspended animation. Why anyone should wish to sleep down the centuries is another question, but who can doubt that once the way is open, some explorers will head into the future, just to see what will happen. </p> <p>I wish luck to those who some day may disprove Flecker's final verse: <br></p> <p> Since I can never see your face <br></p> <p>And never shake you by the hand, <br></p> <p>I send my soul through time and space <br></p> <p>To greet you. You will understand. <br></p>",

However - and here I am sticking my neck out, though without too much fear of contradiction - I suspect that even more people will be speaking English 1,000 years from now than are doing so today. Equally important, we would be able to understand them, as perhaps we could not English-speakers 500 years ago. The advent of sound recording may have frozen pronunciation, though of course our descendants will have vocabularies that would often baffle us. It's an amusing game to make lists of words or phrases that would have been utterly meaningless only a generation ago. My favourite example: how would anyone before 1970 have realised that, at the beginning of the 21st century, millions would spend a major part of their working day fondling a mouse? Yet if English survives as a language, will there be any vestige of the United Kingdom as a political entity 1,000 years from now? I very much doubt it will have another century of existence. The nation state was already dissolving before the internet gave it the final death blow. But the future's most awesome possibility is this - that some people alive today may witness the year 3001. This may be through the achievement of biological immortality, \"downloading\" the mind into another carrier (probably inorganic) or suspended animation. Why anyone should wish to sleep down the centuries is another question, but who can doubt that once the way is open, some explorers will head into the future, just to see what will happen. I wish luck to those who some day may disprove Flecker's final verse: Since I can never see your face And never shake you by the hand, I send my soul through time and space To greet you. You will understand.",

      "body": "<p>Robert Altman is a mandarin power to be reckoned with and his long, troubling career is one of the most fascinating in movies. His reputation depends largely on his status as a 70s icon, and as a survivor. Altman still wields cachet - not so much on the strength of the early great films but rather on his longevity and his \"maverick\" profile: meaning, he continues to make Altman movies, even if the results are unwatchable, crude and lazy. All you need to do to figure out where in hell this codger got all this respect is to see The Long Goodbye. </p> <p>Based on a Raymond Chandler novel that no one had bothered to adapt before, Altman's detective tale amounts to an anti-noir anthem, dressing down the Bogart legend, transforming hard-bitten dick Philip Marlowe into a slovenly, muttering, confused, bemused and unreadable schmoe, slumming around the glitzy LA of the 1970s like an old dog who's lost his sense of smell. </p> <p>The fact that Marlowe was played by Elliott Gould calls the 1970s and the present into sharp relief - when else could such an ungainly, unsexy man become an American movie star? Not to mention Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Warren Oates, Donald Sutherland. Casting Gould was a brilliant move - unlike Bogart, he's not fooling anyone into thinking he's the smartest guy around. Gould's Marlowe appears to be the only honest man in LA, and therein lies the film's narrative pull: Altman's version is more of a Pilgrim's Progress than a tale of justice sought, found and exacted. Toughness and hard-boiled-ness are irrelevant, indeed useless. </p> <p>The Long Goodbye, like the best 1970s films, was not constructed like a suspension bridge (full of \"arcs\" and things), nor overdiscussed in pre-production by marketing homunculi in countless \"development meetings\" and thereafter retaining all the life energy of a stone-dry houseplant. Instead, Altman made a movie in which the scenes, lines and actors all conspire to convince you that their world is real, that it doesn't end at the framelines, that it would exist whether you were watching or not. </p> <p>That could define virtually any of 50 or more films from the American new wave. Looking back into the messy, mad days from which Altman shone when he shone brightest can be disheartening. Come of age between Midnight Cowboy (1969) and Taxi Driver (1976), and you would be convinced, as I was, that the apparent maturation of the art form in Hollywood had reached a point of no return - one that, in fact, it had no intention of respecting. But for Altman, who straddles the ages, the question might be a bit more pragmatic: what exactly did Altman have in his grasp 30 years ago that he hasn't had since? </p> <p>For it does seem that we're saddled with Altman now in ways that ask us to understand the epochal movie moment from which he sprang. Only recently have the gritty, open-ended, unhappy, Hollywood movies, that began with the indie comet Easy Rider in 1967 and ended, more or less, with George Lucas's Nuremberg rally Star Wars in 1977, been given their due as a landmark era, the time when Hollywood stopped being Hollywood and started making real (expressive, risky, meaningful) movies. </p> <p>Today, 20-odd years, six major drug fads, six presidents, three or four wars, and two Oscars to Tom Hanks later, the fantastically homely, sincere, thorny, sometimes haywire but most often scorchingly rigorous movies of the Nixon/'Nam era are finally perceptible as a genre unto themselves, a distinct film-beast rising from a primordial ooze cocktail of social protest, youth culture empowerment, international cinephilia and prole restlessness. They're the most mature and fearless mainstream American movies ever made. </p> <p>Formally, the films of the American new wave have a distinctive vocabulary: natural lighting, grainy texture, free-wheeling compositions, handheld camerawork, authentic locations, ugly actors, inarticulate characters, desolate storylines, unglamorous milieus, an uncondescending vision of a working-class America bound together by a network of obsessive subcultures and a thirst for a true independence it can never find. The budgets were low, the directors free to spit in the wind, the actors ferocious in their quest for realism. Contrast the lean and hungry De Niro, Pacino and Nicholson of the 1970s with their lazy contemporary selves. </p> <p>It didn't last, of course - Ronald Reagan's 1980 ascendancy to president coincided with the new wave's coda, Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. Scorsese remains one of the few living film-makers of that era to retain his status. Bogdanovich, Coppola, Schlesinger, Friedkin, Rafelson, Penn and Pakula are essentially washed up. </p> <p>Altman, on the other hand, won't give up come hell or high water. A generation older than Scorsese, he has been plugging away, in one fashion or another, for more than 40 years. That the 60s-70s Hollywood thaw on formula and pap was waiting for him as he matured is serendipity, resulting in M*A*S*H, McCabe and Mrs Miller, The Long Goodbye, Thieves Like Us, California Split, Nashville and Buffalo Bill and the Indians. </p> <p>These were quintessential 1970s films: formally unpredictable, aurally chaotic, fastidiously realistic, deeply cynical. With M*A*S*H, Altman established his signature style: perversely jumbled soundtracks, focus-challenged compositions, a Babel-like riot of incidental characters. Traces of Altman are unmistakable in films by Paul Thomas Anderson, Steven Soderbergh, Mike Figgis, Ang Lee, Todd Solondz and of course Altman's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Alan Rudolph. </p> <p>After a series of disasters (notably Popeye), Altman hammered away on prosaic theatrical adaptations for 10 years before making his comeback with The Player, and thereafter assaulting us with his worst propensities - gratuitous nudity, dramatic slackness, overindulged ensembles, cheap jokes - in Short Cuts (a heinous mockery of Raymond Carver), Pr\u00e9t-\u00e0-Porter, Kansas City, Cookie's Fortune and Dr T and the Women. But there's no denying that Altman, in the 70s, made a handful of eccentric masterpieces that are still being emulated. </p> <p> \u0095 A two-month retrospective of Robert Altman's films begins at the NFT, London, on January 1 (tickets 020-7928 3232) before going on a national tour.

Every scene, every frame of this deeply strange and intriguing movie is permeated with a mood and a feel that the writer-producer-director effortlessly establishes as his signature. In some ways, Unbreakable is an unfinished, unrealised film, but it lingers potently in the mind for hours, and somehow without its flaws, eccentricities and longueurs it would not be the film it is. </p> <p>Like The Sixth Sense, this is a supernatural thriller with a twist, starring Bruce Willis. The ending will also send you on a frantic mental scurry back to the beginning to check you have got everything right. But unlike The Sixth Sense, there is ambiguity: we are not sure quite how much we've seen is illusory. And crucially, the whole idea of the twist - the surprise ending that the critic cannot reveal - is diluted in intensity but enlarged in scope. In Unbreakable, the ending is arguably the twist, but then so arguably is the middle and the beginning too - along with the whole genre of the film. Perhaps Unbreakable is one enormous twist! </p> <p>Anyway, Willis is David, a security guard who, astonishingly, emerges utterly unscathed from a horrific train crash that kills everyone else. Then he receives an unsettling message from Elijah, a comic book collector and connoisseur with a genetic disorder which means that his bones break at the slightest mishap. Elijah believes he is the alter ego of David, and just as he is condemned to a life of pain and vulnerability, so David is unbreakable; so Elijah passionately urges him to cultivate his destiny as a 21st century superhero. </p> <p>Samuel L Jackson plays Elijah, and gives a terrific performance - his best since Pulp Fiction. His bizarre, angular presence shimmers with charisma. And Shyamalan gets excellent work from fellow Pulp Fiction graduate, Willis. Their relationship is a pairing that works superbly, and their story progresses with its own bizarre realist logic. </p> <p>At the end Unbreakable feels oddly like a first \"collector's issue\" comic, introducing the superhero and setting him up for a long series. So it is unsatisfyingly incomplete in itself, but any sequel in that vein that Shyamalan might give us would spoil the original's mystery and enigma. Nevertheless it is a fascinating film.

There he will be asked to explain his comments in a Sunday newspaper which, among a catalogue of put-downs and criticisms of Ellis, claimed the 76-year-old is \"stuck in a time warp\" and \"talked big while acting small\". But unlike six of the previous eight managers employed during Ellis's 18 years in office, it is likely the audience will end with Gregory heading for Villa Park's last-chance saloon as opposed to the Jobcentre. That is if the normally outspoken Gregory for once demonstrates contrition rather than the attrition he has been waging against Ellis for the past few months. Gregory may call Ellis's bluff, providing there is substance in reports that he is in line to succeed Bobby Robson at Newcastle if Robson moves upstairs at the end of the season. But that scenario ignores Newcastle's refusal to let Robson take the England job on a part-time basis, and Gregory's behaviour at yesterday's weekly press briefing suggested he will be conciliatory. Ellis is expected to demand not only an explanation but also an apology from Gregory.

I know people at City, good people, and I'm sure they will feel just as I do. </p> <p>\"For it to be in the club programme is beyond belief. Whoever has written this article needs to see someone; he needs help. He's certainly no football fan, whoever he is.\" </p> <p>The article, written by David Chidlow, a lifelong City supporter, appeared in the programme for the Boxing Day game against Derby County. </p> <p>Irene Beevers, 60, whose brother, the England international David Pegg, died in the disaster at 22, still lives in his home town of Doncaster along with their mother Jessie, 84. \"Leeds United's fans are notorious for gloating about what happened but you would think there would be more sympathy in Manchester, especially because Frank Swift [one of City's all-time greats] was among those who died,\" she said. </p> <p>\"It's sick. For City to have this in their official programme is despicable. They should be ashamed of themselves. These people are sad individuals and I feel sorry for them. Why do they still do it after all this time? </p> <p>\"The anniversary is coming up in February and at this time of year it's always hard, particularly for my mother. It's time this sort of thing came to a stop. Don't these people realise how upsetting this can be?\" </p> <p>United are furious with their neighbours and City's directors have demanded an explanation from the programme's editor Mike Beddow. </p> <p>\"The programme was not edited properly and this article went into print erroneously. It is the last thing we would want to be associated with,\" said City's chairman David Bernstein. \"It was a mistake and we are sorry for any offence caused. Among other things, we will never forget that Frank Swift was killed in the disaster.\" </p> <p>City are considering carrying an apology in their next club magazine. \"We give the fans their own page in the match programme and the club magazine but they should be edited. Unfortunately this one line, and it was only one line, was missed by somebody,\" said the club's press officer Chris Bird. </p> <p>\"I will be having a meeting with the programme editor to ensure that this sort of thing never happens again. It's unfortunate but it's just a case of human error.\" </p> <p>Joe Royle last night agreed a \u00a33.2m fee with Leeds for Darren Huckerby. The forward will travel to Maine Road this morning for talks after 18 months at Elland Road which have seen him make only 12 first-team starts since signing from Coventry for \u00a34.5m. </p> <p>Robbie Keane's loan from Internazionale has given Leeds greater attacking options and Huckerby was the obvious choice to be sacrificed. </p> <p>If Huckerby and City can agree personal terms quickly, he will be registered by noon today and eligible for his debut against Charlton tomorrow. </p> <p>The Danish winger Jesper Gronkjaer has signed a 4-year contract with Chelsea after satisfying the club over his fitness following his protracted \u00a37.8m move from Ajax. </p> <p>Bradford City have taken Eoin Jess on a three-month loan from Aberdeen with a view to a permanent deal in the summer. The 30-year-old forward will cost \u00a3300,000 if City stay up and a lower fee if relegated.</p>",

Bill Foulkes, who lost eight of his United team-mates that fateful February night, said: \"I just cannot imagine that anyone at City would allow such a thing to happen. I know people at City, good people, and I'm sure they will feel just as I do. \"For it to be in the club programme is beyond belief. Whoever has written this article needs to see someone; he needs help. He's certainly no football fan, whoever he is.\" The article, written by David Chidlow, a lifelong City supporter, appeared in the programme for the Boxing Day game against Derby County. Irene Beevers, 60, whose brother, the England international David Pegg, died in the disaster at 22, still lives in his home town of Doncaster along with their mother Jessie, 84. \"Leeds United's fans are notorious for gloating about what happened but you would think there would be more sympathy in Manchester, especially because Frank Swift [one of City's all-time greats] was among those who died,\" she said. \"It's sick. For City to have this in their official programme is despicable. They should be ashamed of themselves. These people are sad individuals and I feel sorry for them. Why do they still do it after all this time? \"The anniversary is coming up in February and at this time of year it's always hard, particularly for my mother. It's time this sort of thing came to a stop. Don't these people realise how upsetting this can be?\" United are furious with their neighbours and City's directors have demanded an explanation from the programme's editor Mike Beddow. \"The programme was not edited properly and this article went into print erroneously. It is the last thing we would want to be associated with,\" said City's chairman David Bernstein. \"It was a mistake and we are sorry for any offence caused. Among other things, we will never forget that Frank Swift was killed in the disaster.\" City are considering carrying an apology in their next club magazine. \"We give the fans their own page in the match programme and the club magazine but they should be edited. Unfortunately this one line, and it was only one line, was missed by somebody,\" said the club's press officer Chris Bird. \"I will be having a meeting with the programme editor to ensure that this sort of thing never happens again. It's unfortunate but it's just a case of human error.\" Joe Royle last night agreed a \u00a33.2m fee with Leeds for Darren Huckerby. The forward will travel to Maine Road this morning for talks after 18 months at Elland Road which have seen him make only 12 first-team starts since signing from Coventry for \u00a34.5m. Robbie Keane's loan from Internazionale has given Leeds greater attacking options and Huckerby was the obvious choice to be sacrificed. If Huckerby and City can agree personal terms quickly, he will be registered by noon today and eligible for his debut against Charlton tomorrow. The Danish winger Jesper Gronkjaer has signed a 4-year contract with Chelsea after satisfying the club over his fitness following his protracted \u00a37.8m move from Ajax. Bradford City have taken Eoin Jess on a three-month loan from Aberdeen with a view to a permanent deal in the summer. The 30-year-old forward will cost \u00a3300,000 if City stay up and a lower fee if relegated.",

By the year 2050 over 3m Britons will be aged 85. By 2031 over 1,185,000 people will need continuous long-term care - an increase of 68% on today's figure, according to long-term care insurance provider, BUPA.</p>",

These will help buyers to know exactly what assistance they will get, and when, and to shop around to compare available plans so they can find the type best suited to their personal and financial circumstances.\" She added she wanted buyers to know exactly what changes in their circumstances would trigger a claim. \"This will avoid them or their families wrangling over whether they meet the criteria or not, avoiding unnecessary delay in treatment, nursing or care.\" The government also favours full regulation of long term care insurance by the FSA, but is waiting for comment from the insurance industry before this is introduced. Insurers and specialist independent financial advisers have welcomed the introduction of CAT standards. Sandy Johnstone, long-term care strategy manager for Norwich Union said: \"This is bound to move the market forward and, at last, we are released from all the uncertainties of the past.\" Stephen Sklaroff, deputy director general for the Association of British Insurers said: \"CAT standards will increase consumers' confidence to buy insurance in cases where people are responsible for their own care costs. We have always supported appropriate regulation of the marketing of long-term care insurance.\" Gordon Lishman, the director general of charity Age Concern added: \"Older people have waited a long time to get to the point where the government finally seems to have accepted the need to regulate. While putting forward a range of alternative approaches, the preferred option is clearly what we have advocated all along - full regulation.\" The regulation helps to address the growing problem of the UK's ageing population. By the year 2050 over 3m Britons will be aged 85. By 2031 over 1,185,000 people will need continuous long-term care - an increase of 68% on today's figure, according to long-term care insurance provider, BUPA.",
