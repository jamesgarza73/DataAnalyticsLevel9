A few taps back to keeper by both teams and the game has slows down a bit. That's it until Monaco realise they have a game to win and fire in a couple of speculative crosses that Rangers have no trouble clearing. Rangers get caught offside a couple of times.<br> <strong>27</strong> Giuly starts a move on the edge of the Rangers area that ends with Nonda missing what looked like a sitter after good work by Simone to keep a cross in play on the edge of the six-yard box.<br> <strong>31</strong> Mols again manages to turn a defender in the blink of an eye, but Monaco are making most of the running - shame they can't get their attacking play sorted out. <br> <strong>32</strong> Monaco free-kick 35 yards out.

Simone taps for Dabo to fire over the bar.<br> <strong>38</strong> Numan gets up on the left for Rangers and crosses from just inside the Monaco area for Miller to shoot wide.<br> <strong>39 GOAL</strong> Simone whips in a corner from the right and Da Costa meets the ball to head in the equaliser.<br> <strong>41</strong> Rangers reeling now as Nonda turns Vidmar on the edge of the area and drags his shot just wide of the far post.<br> <strong>42</strong> Monaco corner. Simone takes again and the lanky Christanval is unlucky to see his header go over.<br> <strong>45</strong> De Boer glides through midfield, finds Ricksen on the right, picks up the return and wins a free-kick. Monaco break with Nonda but Vidmar gets across to cut him off. Half-time.</p> <p> <strong>46</strong> Nonda kicks off for Monaco and Simone hoofs the ball up to Christenson in the Rangers goal. <br> <strong>47</strong> Monaco almost take the lead after Amoruso dwells on the ball and allows Simone to break through the back line.

Simone is charging around trying to do the job of three men, despite the fact the the three men around him are happy to do their bit. <strong>75</strong> Dabo shoots from 30 yards but only sees it fly into the crowd.<br> <strong>77</strong> Albertz gets on the end of a Miller cross from the right but his shot from the edge of the area is saved.<br> <strong>78 GOAL</strong> Disaster for Rangers just seconds after Albertz's chance. Prso slides the ball through to Simone and he runs across Christensen before putting a shot past the Rangers keeper at the far post. <strong>Substitution</strong> Wallace on for De Boer.</p> <p> <strong>83</strong> Rangers continue to live dangerously as a cross and header by Monaco only just clears the bar. <br> <strong>84</strong> Manic stuff now as both teams try to get the elusive winner that will see them through to the next round.<br> <strong>85 Substitution</strong> McCann on for Albertz. Rangers corner from the left - Gravelaine hooks it clear from the goal-line.<br> <strong>86</strong> Monaco free-kick from wide on the left, but it is too deep for everyone in the area.<br> <strong>87</strong> Wallace controls the ball well 30 yards out, but opts to snatch at a long-range shot instead of looking around him for other options.<br> <strong>90</strong> Rangers free-kick deep on the left; handball given against Rangers. McCann gets away on the left and crosses superbly but Wallace cannot make his shot count. Rangers last chance? Monaco then come close when Bonnal drags his shot wide of the far post. Monaco's last chance? End to end of stuff.... but that's it, full-time. Both Monaco and Rangers go out of the competition, Rangers fate assured after Sturm Graz and Galatasaray potter around for the last few minutes of their 2-2 draw in Istanbul after hearing the result in Scotland.</p>",

Simone taps for Dabo to fire over the bar. 38 Numan gets up on the left for Rangers and crosses from just inside the Monaco area for Miller to shoot wide. 39 GOAL Simone whips in a corner from the right and Da Costa meets the ball to head in the equaliser. 41 Rangers reeling now as Nonda turns Vidmar on the edge of the area and drags his shot just wide of the far post. 42 Monaco corner. Simone takes again and the lanky Christanval is unlucky to see his header go over. 45 De Boer glides through midfield, finds Ricksen on the right, picks up the return and wins a free-kick. Monaco break with Nonda but Vidmar gets across to cut him off. Half-time. 46 Nonda kicks off for Monaco and Simone hoofs the ball up to Christenson in the Rangers goal. 47 Monaco almost take the lead after Amoruso dwells on the ball and allows Simone to break through the back line. He runs it too far and after some fancy, but insignificant, jigging around, Rangers clear. 50 Nonda races away from Vidmar down the right, but Vidmar recovers well to chop him down under the guise of well-timed sliding tackle. 52 GOAL Mols, clean through just inside the area, waits to read the bounce of a high lob over the back line and shoots past Porato to put Rangers in the lead. 56 Substitution Tugay on for Mols. 57 Substitution Prso on for Nonda. 58 Rangers corner from the left; Porato gathers easily. 60 Da Costa feeds Giuly on the right but his cross is gathered by Christensen. 62 Monaco coming forward with determination now and it's clear Rangers are going to have to fight to get a result. 63 Rangers have a chance to wrap things up when Numan, on the left edge of the Monaco area, crosses for Ferguson to shoot high into the crowd. 55 Booking Gravelaine for chopping down Ricksen. 67 Simone finds Giuly in the Rangers area but Numan does well to hustle him out and clear. 68 Giuly now an ever-present threat, but Rangers manage to break as Albertz finds Miller in space on the left. Miller gets into the area and then fluffs his chance to get a second. 70 Booking Dabo for a challenge on Albertz, who needs to go off for some attention as a result. 72 Monaco are not giving up. Simone is charging around trying to do the job of three men, despite the fact the the three men around him are happy to do their bit. 75 Dabo shoots from 30 yards but only sees it fly into the crowd. 77 Albertz gets on the end of a Miller cross from the right but his shot from the edge of the area is saved. 78 GOAL Disaster for Rangers just seconds after Albertz's chance. Prso slides the ball through to Simone and he runs across Christensen before putting a shot past the Rangers keeper at the far post. Substitution Wallace on for De Boer. 83 Rangers continue to live dangerously as a cross and header by Monaco only just clears the bar. 84 Manic stuff now as both teams try to get the elusive winner that will see them through to the next round. 85 Substitution McCann on for Albertz. Rangers corner from the left - Gravelaine hooks it clear from the goal-line. 86 Monaco free-kick from wide on the left, but it is too deep for everyone in the area. 87 Wallace controls the ball well 30 yards out, but opts to snatch at a long-range shot instead of looking around him for other options. 90 Rangers free-kick deep on the left; handball given against Rangers. McCann gets away on the left and crosses superbly but Wallace cannot make his shot count. Rangers last chance? Monaco then come close when Bonnal drags his shot wide of the far post. Monaco's last chance? End to end of stuff.... but that's it, full-time. Both Monaco and Rangers go out of the competition, Rangers fate assured after Sturm Graz and Galatasaray potter around for the last few minutes of their 2-2 draw in Istanbul after hearing the result in Scotland.",

A naturally genial, humorous and self-deprecating man, he lost his cool with reporters when asked if failure tonight might lead to his dismissal. </p> <p>\"I am sick of being asked this question by the media; it is absolutely out of order,\" he barked. \"In most of my time with Rangers we have won, won, won but now in a bad period I am being asked this and I find it wrong.

Van Bronckhorst and Mols are arguably Rangers' two most gifted players, and yesterday it emerged that Van Bronckhorst will certainly miss tonight's match and Mols remains doubtful. Wearing away at Advocaat's conviction even more was the news that Ronald de Boer, from whom Rangers require a big performance, is still troubled with a knee strain. And in defence they will be without the suspended Bert Konterman. </p> <p>\"We will miss Van Bronckhorst; he needs to go back to Holland for further treatment,\" Advocaat said. \"As for Mols, he remains a doubt but I still hope he will make it.

They'll miss the daily triumphs and disasters of a character of Shakespearean complexity, a president who stirred in the American people passions of love and hatred unseen since the days of John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon - and almost never aroused by a single man. Above all, they will miss his signature feature, one which may well have redefined the presidency itself: an almost eerie gift for empathy.</p> <p>I will miss him, too. For the years of Clinton's American journey matched my own. I first came to live and work in the country in 1992, just as he exploded on to the national scene. I watched him run for president, and stayed to see him do the job. From then on, and for several years, I either watched, read or wrote about Clinton nearly every day. Just as future TV documentary makers keen to evoke the 1990s will flash up an image of the president, I suspect that, when I look back on my late 20s or early 30s, I will do the same. And tonight that era will come to a close.</p> <p>The memories come so fast that it's not easy to separate them. That 1992 election alone was so chock-full of scandal and turnarounds, such a vintage campaign, that it's hard to forget any of it - whether it was Gennifer with a G, the Vietnam draft-dodging letter, written by Clinton while a student at Oxford, or Hillary on 60 Minutes insisting she had been no Tammy Wynette standing by her man, and that if you didn't like her husband, then, \"Heck, don't vote for him.\"</p> <p>It was a crazy year, but it was that Clinton gift for empathy which saw him through. I had heard about it before - Republicans had already ridiculed the Arkansas governor's tendency to begin sentences with \"I feel\" rather than \"I think\", a habit that reached its apotheosis in the legendary \"I feel your pain.\" But there was no substitute for seeing it in action.</p> <p>Of course there were the moments widely witnessed, such as those few seconds during one of the televised debates, when the candidates were asked how the recession had affected them personally. Clinton turned the query around, asking the questioner how she had suffered. Meanwhile, his opponent, George Bush Snr, was caught on camera checking his watch.</p> <p>But there were also the tiny episodes, too small to be reported in their own right, which offered a glimpse of Clinton's sheer talent for people. It's perhaps hard, after this year's lacklustre contest, to imagine the excitement Clinton generated that autumn. \"The failed governor of a small southern state,\" the Republicans had called him. But the voters didn't see it that way. I remember two moments from a Clinton-Gore bus tour through the American heartland. It was a swing through southern Georgia and the buzz was palpable. People didn't just attend rallies, they lined the highways in crowds to catch a glimpse of the man who would be president. Some held banners urging the young governor with the gargantuan appetite (he can eat a whole apple in a single bite) to stop awhile and sample the local peaches or peanuts - and he always did.</p> <p>His aides would get enraged, every stop delaying the tour by a few more crucial minutes. By the end of a campaign day, Clinton would be running four or five hours late, but it didn't matter. In the town square at Valdosta a crowd that had gathered for a 9pm rally waited till 2am. Under floodlights on that September night, they cheered themselves hoarse.</p> <p>Earlier that day, we'd been in a small town called Tifton. Clinton had delivered the usual stump speech, his throat sore, when it began to pour with rain. The reporters ran for cover, inside a makeshift press room where there was the usual supply of chicken drumsticks and Diet Coke. Eventually an Israeli journalist tapped me on the shoulder. \"Come outside,\" he said. \"Look at this.\"</p> <p>The candidate was still out there, shaking the hands of fewer than a dozen elderly voters who had stayed out in the rain. He was talking to each one - not just a \"Hi, how are you,\" but a proper conversation - as the rain streamed down his face and theirs. His aides were urging him to hurry out, desperate to whisk him on to the bus and into a new shirt. This was not a pose to show how much he cared about ordinary people: there was not a single camera to record it. Besides me and the Israeli, no one saw it. But Clinton did it all the same.</p> <p>Who knows why? Maybe the legend was right: maybe Clinton believed that so long as he met every single voter in America, they would all vote for him. Maybe his childhood (widowed mother, alcoholic stepfather) had left him with a near-addictive need for human contact, affection and adulation. Maybe he just cared.</p> <p>Either way, it worked and worked. The crowds got bigger, his voice got hoarser and the empathy gift won that election. I returned to London determined to get work in America that would let me see the next chapter of the story: how Clinton the candidate would become Clinton the president.</p> <p>The transition was not easy. A dozen books have recounted the political errors of those first months. Day one saw a promise to let gays into the military, a move which only confirmed the brass's worst suspicions about the new, draft-dodging commander-in-chief. Later Hillary Clinton took control of healthcare reform - a move that would bring the administration's greatest defeat. The first lady presented Congress with an almost comically complicated blueprint for a new system: expressed as a diagram, it looked like a circuit-board for the space shuttle. The fact that the plan had been hatched by a taskforce of wonks meeting with Hillary in secret added to its Soviet-era aura. By 1994 the plan was dead, and the Clinton administration badly wounded.</p> <p>Things were no easier for the president himself. The Washington establishment was not sure what to make of this brash southern newcomer. They were both excited by and disdainful of him. They sniffed at the Arkansans who piled into town, supporting their beloved Razorbacks football team with the uncouth chant \"Oooo pig soo-eeee!\" For the Washington elite, Clinton and his friends were hicks, plain and simple.</p> <p>The greybeards also disdained his way of doing business. They heard that the president would have long \"bull sessions\" more akin to the college seminar room than the Oval Office. They saw the pizza delivery bikes skidding up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as the young, novice staff worked through the night. While Bush had been a grown-up, Clinton's White House seemed to lack adult supervision.</p> <p>The word of the hour back then was \"unpresidential\". The Washington snobs disliked Clinton's habit of answering reporters' questions while still out of breath, pale thighs wobbling. They winced when he answered an MTV inquiry about his taste in underwear: \"Boxers or briefs?\"</p> <p>What the scolds did not realise was that all this \"unpresidential\" behaviour was connected to the president's greatest strength: his common touch. He was comfortable with people. So when a little girl, invited to the Oval Office to take part in a candle-lighting ceremony to mark the Jewish festival of Chanukah, yelped as her hair caught fire, guess who put out the flames and calmed her nerves? Not an aide, but the prez himself.</p> <p>Clinton was like that Star Trek character, the empath, who can psychically read the emotions of those before him; he had a mind-reader's ability to see into the hearts of any individual or group he faced.</p> <p>I saw the trick at work in Baltimore, when the president was out selling his healthcare package. He was addressing an outdoor crowd of thousands of hospital staff. I was standing among a group of nurses, who began chatting and whispering. Their minds were wandering. Somehow, from faraway, Clinton sensed it. He suddenly declared that his plan really mattered, that it would affect all of them, nurses especially - and that they all had to listen up. The women around me hushed.</p> <p>The gift did not save him from the failure of the healthcare programme, a defeat that was endorsed by 1994's mid-term elections, which the Republicans won by a landslide. Overnight Newt Gingrich became the hottest politician in America, cheerily explaining that he would be prime minister to Clinton's now largely ceremonial president. Soon Clinton was forced to tell a press conference why he and his office were still \"relevant\".</p> <p>But the mood changed. On April 19 1995 a right-wing extremist detonated a bomb at a government building in Oklahoma City, leaving 168 dead. Suddenly the anti-government bile of Gingrich's revolutionaries left a much harsher taste in the mouth: America had seen where such talk could lead.</p> <p>Clinton stepped forward as the calmer voice, leading the Oklahoma families in mourning. Perhaps for the first time, he looked presidential - a father of the nation at a moment of crisis. Just then, America needed a leader who would feel their pain.</p> <p>In fact, though no official would ever say it out loud, mourning worked well for Clinton: he gave good funeral. He knew how to touch just the right nerve. I remember a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, dedicating a memorial to those who had died in the Lockerbie bombing. He spoke well, as always, but it was afterwards that he came into his own. A huddle of relatives gathered around him. He spoke to each of them, but then he extended his big hands to reach the ones who had not pressed forward, the ones too shy to approach the president themselves. He encouraged them and beckoned them closer, his eyes finding the hesitant widow or retiring father who was holding back. Again, I looked around: no cameras. The TV crews had already got their pictures; Clinton was not doing it for appearances' sake. He stayed there a full hour over schedule, maddening his handlers and listening to the stories of bereaved loved ones - and not a word was ever written about it.</p> <p>This talent or knack or psychosis - whatever it was, it secured Clinton's position as president. Groups who had once been suspicious began to like and eventually adore him.</p> <p>Take black Americans. In 1992 they had big doubts about Clinton. He was a white politician from the deep south, a Democrat who had signalled his \"centrist\" credentials by attacking black rapper Sister Souljah and by breaking off from the campaign to return to his home state - to order the execution of a retarded black man convicted of murder.</p> <p>Yet within a few years Clinton would be hailed by Toni Morrison, the African-American Nobel laureate, as \"our first black president\" and by the rapper Ice-T as \"a brother\". What had changed? Clinton had saved affirmative action from the Republican axe, but he'd also signed a welfare reform bill which hit black families hard. No, it wasn't policy which sealed the bond between Clinton and black America. It was a more subtle connection. The president displayed a comfort with black audiences that was unheard of among white politicians. He could deliver an impromptu speech-cum-sermon from the pulpit of a black church that had civil rights activists admitting they had heard nothing so inspiring since the days of Martin Luther King. The result is a white president who enjoys 95% approval ratings among African-Americans to this very day.</p> <p>Jewish voters tell a similar story. They were wary of a southern baptist Democrat in 1992: they feared he might be another Jimmy Carter, too sympathetic to the Palestinians. But Clinton reassured them, using his secret weapon: emotional intelligence. It was his instinct and body language that led to that 1993 handshake on the White House lawn between the PLO's Yasser Arafat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin. And when Rabin was assassinated two years later, it was Clinton who knew how to massage Israel's wounded spirit. He spoke to them, via TV, in their own language, addressing the dead Rabin with the words \"Shalom chaver\" - goodbye friend. The phrase had not existed in Hebrew before then; now it's common Israeli parlance. And so, in 1996, Jewish Americans turned out - alongside blacks and women and Hispanics and trade unions and every other group who felt understood by Clinton - to give him four more years.</p> <p>I took that as my cue to head back to Britain. I reckoned we'd seen the best of Clinton. The second term would be more of the same, only less so. And for the first year, 1997, I seemed to be vindicated: the economy prospered on auto-pilot and Clinton barely had to break a sweat. But in the first weeks of 1998 the sky fell in. The allegations of a dress-staining affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, the finger-wagging denial, the talk of perjury and impeachment - it all came so fast. The Washington punditocracy predicted that the Arkansas hick would be sent back to Little Rock by the end of the week. But they forgot who they were dealing with. Clinton was not just the Comeback Kid, the Houdini who had survived a thousand scrapes. He was also the empath-in-chief, and now he got the return on his investment: the American people empathised back.</p> <p>They had already forgiven or ignored the waves of scandal that had broken with every season of the first term: Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and all the other gates never really swung. The American people apparently felt the same way about the president as a former Arkansas state senator I once interviewed. He had worked with the then governor throughout the 1980s and had little sympathy for him politically. But he was adamant: \"Bill Clinton doesn't give duck crap about money.\" Americans could see that for themselves: they had a president who had never owned his own house (he had lived in the Arkansas governor's mansion since he was 32, moving from there directly to the White House). He may have been a shameless hustler after votes, but few voters believed Clinton was ever in the business of lining his own pockets. That's why all the stuff about Whitewater never stuck.</p> <p>Zippergate was different: Clinton may not have lusted after cash, but Americans knew he lusted after flesh. They knew, too, that he had an indisciplined, selfish, self-indulgent streak. They knew he could be reckless and self-destructive, taking a risk he must have known could have ended his presidency.</p> <p>But here's where empathy became a two-way street. Despite a year-long hammering from the Republicans, and a press united in its disgust for the president's actions, the public stood by him. Americans told pollsters they hated what Clinton had done but, from the first revelations in January 1998 to the senate trial a year later, they remained consistent, approving his performance as president and insisting that he should not be removed from office.</p> <p>They understood him, just as he had understood them. He had always seemed to cut them a little slack, and now they returned the compliment. In the autumn of 1998 they watched the tapes of a beleaguered president assaulted by excruciatingly personal questions from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors - grainy footage with the visual grammar of a hostage video - and they sided with him. Just like Hillary, they stood by their man.</p> <p>Once, when speaking about his faith, Clinton described the God he believed in as \"the God of second chances\" - and he let out a little smile. That was the Clinton of early 1999: a lucky man, blessed with forgiveness.</p> <p>In the end, he was less Houdini than Rasputin. The Republicans tried and tried to kill him, but they failed, destroying themselves in the attempt. Where are his enemies now? Gingrich was forced out of the Speaker's chair after the impeachment debacle, so was his successor. The rest of the president's persecutors in the House are in tight congressional races today, desperate just to hold on to their seats.</p> <p>And as for Clinton, this is his last day in total command. I can look back now on the last eight years and admit that we, those of us who covered him, were spoiled. We saw a president with towering political skills and a serious intellect - a man who could rattle off the fine-print detail of any policy programme anywhere in America and discuss the domestic politics of most countries in the world, a leader who would think nothing of calling up the great academics and writers of the day, often in the small hours, for a late-night, unarranged t\u00e9-te-\u00e0-t\u00e9te.</p> <p>And there was that gift for people. I admit it, it spoiled me - it even skewed my judgment. I came back from America to cover Britain's 1997 election, and was soon whispering to friends my anxiety that Tony Blair's success was far from assured: he got such little enthusiasm from the crowds. I'd got used to winning candidates getting a Clinton-sized response. Now I can see that I had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. Like someone who heard Sinatra sing in the 1950s or watched John McEnroe play tennis in the 1980s, I had seen a maestro at the height of his powers. Clinton was the Pele of politics, and we might wait half a century to see his like again.</p> <p>Today America is choosing between two half-Clintons. They can have a version of his smarts, in Al Gore, or a version of his warmth, in George W Bush. Clinton wants the voters to choose Gore, of course, to protect his legacy. But if America picks Bush, that will be a kind of compliment, too. For it will prove that an ability to connect, which Bush has and Gore does not, is now an indispensable part of the job - thanks to Clinton, the king of empathy.</p> <p>Smarts or warmth, one or the other is on offer today. Voters who want both will just have to wait. Or they can take one last look at the man from Hope - and remember.</p>",

For the United States has three months to let go of a leader who has, by turns, enthralled, appalled and seduced them for eight compelling years. Bill Clinton won't officially become the ex-president till a minute past noon on January 20 2001, but by late tonight he will be yesterday's man. He will lose his throne, either to his appointed heir or to the son of the king he slayed to get there. One of them will be the president-elect and, in a heartbeat, Clinton will slip from emblem of America's present to holdover from America's past.

They understood him, just as he had understood them. He had always seemed to cut them a little slack, and now they returned the compliment. In the autumn of 1998 they watched the tapes of a beleaguered president assaulted by excruciatingly personal questions from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors - grainy footage with the visual grammar of a hostage video - and they sided with him. Just like Hillary, they stood by their man. Once, when speaking about his faith, Clinton described the God he believed in as \"the God of second chances\" - and he let out a little smile. That was the Clinton of early 1999: a lucky man, blessed with forgiveness. In the end, he was less Houdini than Rasputin. The Republicans tried and tried to kill him, but they failed, destroying themselves in the attempt. Where are his enemies now? Gingrich was forced out of the Speaker's chair after the impeachment debacle, so was his successor. The rest of the president's persecutors in the House are in tight congressional races today, desperate just to hold on to their seats. And as for Clinton, this is his last day in total command. I can look back now on the last eight years and admit that we, those of us who covered him, were spoiled. We saw a president with towering political skills and a serious intellect - a man who could rattle off the fine-print detail of any policy programme anywhere in America and discuss the domestic politics of most countries in the world, a leader who would think nothing of calling up the great academics and writers of the day, often in the small hours, for a late-night, unarranged t\u00e9-te-\u00e0-t\u00e9te. And there was that gift for people. I admit it, it spoiled me - it even skewed my judgment. I came back from America to cover Britain's 1997 election, and was soon whispering to friends my anxiety that Tony Blair's success was far from assured: he got such little enthusiasm from the crowds. I'd got used to winning candidates getting a Clinton-sized response. Now I can see that I had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. Like someone who heard Sinatra sing in the 1950s or watched John McEnroe play tennis in the 1980s, I had seen a maestro at the height of his powers. Clinton was the Pele of politics, and we might wait half a century to see his like again. Today America is choosing between two half-Clintons. They can have a version of his smarts, in Al Gore, or a version of his warmth, in George W Bush. Clinton wants the voters to choose Gore, of course, to protect his legacy. But if America picks Bush, that will be a kind of compliment, too. For it will prove that an ability to connect, which Bush has and Gore does not, is now an indispensable part of the job - thanks to Clinton, the king of empathy. Smarts or warmth, one or the other is on offer today. Voters who want both will just have to wait. Or they can take one last look at the man from Hope - and remember.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q:</strong> You appear to leap from genre to genre, do you programme those leaps into the development stage?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Looking for some juicy new genre to attack? It hasn't necessarily been problematic, but I think there's two things that have happened as the years go by. One related to the nerd side of me, which is an engagement with the film's historical record and the traditions, and many of them are Hollywood traditions that Hollywood itself has just forgotten as the fads pile up. I think the engagement with that, those tasks, is very enriching for me personally. For Ang it's a different tack, but it's also quite similar, to rub up against those traditions, to continually test your craft, to treat yourself as a craftsperson as well as an artist. There's a certain luxury associated with that exercise. So I think that the generic imperative is going to continue, we don't necessarily have one that we're dying to do next. Although musicals have been bandied around a bit. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But we haven't really decided yet.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> That's the beauty of working with James, I think, a film professor. You know, whenever I am tired of doing this one, abundant sources come my way. Swoosh! So writing the script is the least interesting thing to us. It's what film we're going to create, what fun we're going to have, what kind of angle are we going to put on it, what juice are we going to put in. That was the real fun, not genre or script writing - you know, craft, what fun we're going to have. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon seems to be a big leap of faith. What was the danger? The financial risk?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Of course it was a big risk. A lot of stress. It was something I've wanted to do for a long time, but didn't really have the skill until I'd made six films. Then I was ready to take the challenge. I think the biggest challenge I had was doing a genre film that takes a lot of money to make, and on top of that I want to make A-grade drama, and see if I can keep a balance and have both of them benefit each other. On top of that, I want to do a big landscape in China. So all of that is very challenging. To me it is important after three English-language films that I go back to my cultural roots, to fulfill my boyhood dreams. But it also a new adventure, because that kind of film-making is low budget in America but is titanic in China. There are no rules. We get to make the rules. There's no producer to look over my shoulder. There is no set standard. Of course, I keep testing the limit. </p> <p>James will tell you the story of how much each area would give for an Ang Lee film with Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh. Then they would give us a number and we would come up with that budget. James can fill you in. It's a very interesting process, the financial process, and what's at stake. Once the money's raised, we're OK, we're making the movie. But for the investors, the movie has to make $60m to break even. No Chinese film has ever come close to that. It's a kind of mission impossible. But it's what we want to do. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/4.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (1 min 45)</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Well, these were interesting circumstances to go asking for money in Hollywood for Ang for a Chinese-language film. Namely because after the 'blockbuster' success of The Ice Storm and the 'firestorm of praise and heaps of money' that showered upon us after Ride with the Devil. . . Basically, if this film didn't work, Ang would be directing segments for Fox TV's Scariest Animal Moments. . . so there was a little bit of iffyness involved. And the Taiwanese billionaire who pledged to put up all the money, I don't know, maybe it was a bad mahjong day or something. . .</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It was the Asian economic storm. . .</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The virus. Anyhow. So we had to pull numbers out of Europe, and particularly a lot of long-standing friends and the distribution community here, who still had faith in Ang, and prove with those numbers that this film could support a budget of X dollars. At that point we brought in Sony Pictures Classics in the States, another Sony - the Columbia Pictures, Asia and then the Sony entity of Columbia Pictures International in order to pick up the other territories, including the Asian territories and Latin America. There was this corporate family who came in to put the pieces together and help us make the film. But at that point it was also a corporate family whose cookie jar was empty. So we had to bank all these contracts, we had to find a bank that was crazy enough to do that, and that was in France. Then we had to get a bond company to insure the movie, because the bank wouldn't give us any money until we had an insurance policy that said we would deliver this wacky movie that was being shot all over China. So they were in Los Angeles. And then we had the Taiwanese production end. But in order to close the deals, for tax reasons (it's a complicated story), they had to set up a subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands. Our limited liability corporation, that we set up in the United States, had the sub-licence to English-language rights. So we ended up with literally thousands of pages of legal documentation, all of which had to be signed in a circular way - one of those things where the guy in Italy isn't going to sign until the guy in France has signed. Meanwhile they were in Beijing already, pre-producing the movie and more or less mortgaging Ang's house. So it was a little iffy.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> All of which could have been put at risk by one or two tiny accidents, like Michelle Yeoh messing up her knee quite early on in the shoot?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Yes, second week of shooting, unfortunately. Doing a spinning flying-kick, something she did thousands of times. But she didn't pay attention and it was at the end of a night's shooting, and 'crack', she snapped her knee ligament and has to be sent away for surgery. For about 2 1/2 months we have to reschedule everything. It was a nightmare. The movie started out shooting in the Gobi desert - it was just a logistical nightmare - sandstorms, lost in the desertand flood. In the desert. Two weeks of rain!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The locals went up to our producer, Bill Kong, who had been burning incense each day for good luck and getting none of it. They said, 'Thank you so much for burning that incense, because that's what we do when we want rain!'</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> So the whole production was like that. Nothing worked. Every little detail I had to, like, kill myself, kill everybody, just to make it work. The whole production was like that. I thought I was dying sometimes. I don't know how I lived through that. When people ask me about a sequel. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It's just insane. <br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/5.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> (1 min 37)</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the novel of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon available here?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> We're trying to arrange it. . . well, there was an abridged version of the novel published in Taiwan and they're trying to arrange a translation of that abridged version. Of course, that abridged version was copyright piracy. . . Oh yeah. .. So who knows if they'll cut through that.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you both fans of the martial arts genre, and if so, which are your favourite directors in the genre?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I grew up with it. I'm a big fan. When I was younger it's the storytelling that really grabbed me, the fantasy storytelling, about power, about personal transcendence, about romance. Morality tales. A secret joy we had when growing up. As I grew a little older, the Hong Kong choreographers took over the genre and made fantastic fight sequences. Of course, they don't really care what's in between the fights. So that film language really fascinated me as a young film student. So it really fascinated me in both ways. I really wanted to hit the high notes of the Hong Kong action standards, while I have the fantastic movie and the applause and everything else. So that's something I've always wanted to do. </p> <p>Among those directors, King Hu is more of a director to look up to, and Chang Che is one of them. The recent ones, they don't really influence me except some of the really classic fighting sequences - the stories I didn't care for much.</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> I saw a fair amount when we were researching the film. My current favourite is Chang Che, who was working in the 60s and 70s, and if you ever get the chance to score a tape of One-armed Swordsman. . . These are incredibly brutal, queer, kind of sadomasochistic fight movies, with all these greased-up guys chopping each other to bits. They're pretty fun!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I heard you were planning a prequel next year and also is it true that Chow Yun-Fat has declared that he is taking a break from film for the next year and a half?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> If I were Chow and had made this movie with this guy - I wouldn't work again.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Not next year. I couldn't take it anymore. I'm so exhausted. I probably need to make one or two English-language films to recover from it. Physically I can't take it anymore.</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> But don't worry, they'll be 20 other Chinese movies with the title Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - the Prequel, coming out next year. . .</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You portray very interesting female characters in your movies. You don't see that very often in films, so where do you get your ideas from?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> From my wife, I suppose. Seriously. And my ex-girlfriend. Actually I was brought up in a very chauvinist, traditional Chinese male way, but at heart I guess I'm just not a macho guy. I'm not going to be John Woo. Strong women attract me in real life, and in dramatic context. A strong woman, when her heart is broken, it breaks my heart. It's something that speaks for me very well. When there are such characters in the text, I just tend to grab them. I don't know why. It's just chemistry find that I do a much better job with strong female characters than anything else. </p> <p>Somehow in Asia, I notice, women make up 80 per cent of my audience. So you see women with crouching men sitting next to them [pulls the face of a very quiet, small man]maybe at The Wedding Banquet you'll see a couple of guys. </p> <p>I think it is also a refreshing angle to check into repressed male-dominated society. Particularly for this one, which is a very macho genre, it just gives a different angle. There is a deeper emotional depth because we are taking an emotional tour with the heroines. I just like that. It's the best thing I can offer, I suppose. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/6.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> (2 mins 25) </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Could you speak about the fight sequence in the forest at the end of the movie - how long did it take?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It took two weeks to shoot that scene. Most of it is on the editing floor. . . it was just a crazy idea that I had and everyone refused to do it for months. There is no shortage of swordfighting in bamboo forests, because bamboo provides a very romantic environment. In China, bamboo symbolises righteousness - it shoots straight up, it's elastic, like the swordsmanship. Also it provides a very interesting foreground. But normally no-one ever gets up there because it's undo-able. That's why I wanted to do it.</p> <p>The colour of green is really the Hidden Dragon for me in the movie, against the colour of red in the desert flashback. The crouching one, the forbidden one to me is really green. The Green Destiny, Jade-eyed Fox. Anything green, with a little bit of white, is very sexy and taboo-ish for me. So I thought the bamboo choreographed sequence really, in an abstract way, is mesmerising. It's not really a fight. I thought it was a good place to do it. You know, we live in a place with gravity. I sort of underestimate that. </p> <p>It's very painful for the actors and I worry about their safety. They were down in the bamboo forest in the southern part of China, in the valleys. It's hard to get a big construction crane in there. We managed to get four or five in there and hang the actors up. There's the valley and the creek, so they're really high up there, and we had to build platforms for the tighter shots. Once you cut the bamboo, the leaves dwindle. Only on drizzling days can you shoot for half an hour, then you have to change the bamboo again. It's really painful But it's a crazy idea.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I wasn't really sure about the flashback scenes. Why did you spend so long in the desert when it didn't seem to be crucial to the film? And also, how does scriptwriting work in terms of there having to be a constant translation between English and Chinese?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> I can answer the first question about the flashback: It's a big mistake, we're sorry.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It was a very big topic for us. In general, every time I see the movie, which is less and less (but he [Ang Lee] sits through it all the time!) I think, 'I can't believe we got away with this!' All of a sudden, for 20 minutes, they go back there. . . and it's completely unapologetic, it's like cut/back, cut/back. We're ready to take it on the chin a bit, hence my feistiness. But there are a lot of reasons why we love the flashback. </p> <p>But I'll tell you a little about the scriptwriting process. It was extremely educational for me, and extremely painful for Ang. We started with a Chinese-language draft, and then Ang made a precis of the parts of the fourth volume that were most important to him. Then I wrote this completely entertaining swash-buckling romantic adventurous epic movie, that was a joke to the Chinese who reading it. I use the analogy that if a Chinese person wrote a John Wayne western, and he rides into town, gets off his horse, walks over to the sheriff, says 'Howdy' and then, like, kow-tows nine times. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But the structure was there. I think if I was Chinese it would be a nightmare parody of my entire culture. But structurally, I think, it still ended up working. Then Ang and Hui-Ling Huang really took it over and from inside-out really transformed the film, and really got into a lot of the cultural references, indices - the soul, which I had misread. Even though I'd read a lot of Chinese stuff in English translation and seen a lot of movies, I misread almost every cue. So it was great that the process became six months of mutual torture through bad translation . . .can you imagine trying to write your script and have somebody who had been fired from the UN doing bad translation? . . . I always thought we were going to make a movie that was understandable to westerners, but still very Chinese, and I still think essentially it's a Chinese film. But in a way I also recognise that why the film has been so massively successful in Asia is not because it retained its Asian identity, but because of all these wonderful new things that came about in discourse with the west. Especially in regards to the female characters and the romance, which are very foreign to the genre. I think that one of the things I find people responding to here in the west is precisely the fact that you get to see a two-hour Taoist action movie. The Chinese-ness of it, even if it's not always entirely comprehensible because of the subtitles, I think that's what's so profoundly new about it. So in a way we ended up making an eastern movie for western audiences and in some ways a more western movie for eastern audiences. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/7.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (2 mins 27)</p> <p> <strong>AL:</strong> To me, James is the best writer I personally know of. Take this film, it has to hit Asia like a summer blockbuster, but at the same time it has to be in the art-house cinemas and the New York Film Festival. So from the New York Film Festival to Asian blockbuster is a big range to cover. James doesn't know Chinese, but the structure and the film logic and the sellability, marketability and the pure grade of how good the script is. I do need his help, that's just the bottom line. It's painful for me to say so, but Goddamn it, it's so true.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I just have a comment, not a question. I found Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon exhilarating and profoundly moving. I want to say thank you.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> I've seen it twice and I think it's the most amazing film I've seen in a long time.

JS: We're trying to arrange it. . . well, there was an abridged version of the novel published in Taiwan and they're trying to arrange a translation of that abridged version. Of course, that abridged version was copyright piracy. . . Oh yeah. .. So who knows if they'll cut through that. Q: Are you both fans of the martial arts genre, and if so, which are your favourite directors in the genre? AL: I grew up with it. I'm a big fan. When I was younger it's the storytelling that really grabbed me, the fantasy storytelling, about power, about personal transcendence, about romance. Morality tales. A secret joy we had when growing up. As I grew a little older, the Hong Kong choreographers took over the genre and made fantastic fight sequences. Of course, they don't really care what's in between the fights. So that film language really fascinated me as a young film student. So it really fascinated me in both ways. I really wanted to hit the high notes of the Hong Kong action standards, while I have the fantastic movie and the applause and everything else. So that's something I've always wanted to do. Among those directors, King Hu is more of a director to look up to, and Chang Che is one of them. The recent ones, they don't really influence me except some of the really classic fighting sequences - the stories I didn't care for much. JS: I saw a fair amount when we were researching the film. My current favourite is Chang Che, who was working in the 60s and 70s, and if you ever get the chance to score a tape of One-armed Swordsman. . . These are incredibly brutal, queer, kind of sadomasochistic fight movies, with all these greased-up guys chopping each other to bits. They're pretty fun! [Laughter] Q: I heard you were planning a prequel next year and also is it true that Chow Yun-Fat has declared that he is taking a break from film for the next year and a half? JS: If I were Chow and had made this movie with this guy - I wouldn't work again. AL: Not next year. I couldn't take it anymore. I'm so exhausted. I probably need to make one or two English-language films to recover from it. Physically I can't take it anymore. JS: But don't worry, they'll be 20 other Chinese movies with the title Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - the Prequel, coming out next year. . . Q: You portray very interesting female characters in your movies. You don't see that very often in films, so where do you get your ideas from? AL: From my wife, I suppose. Seriously. And my ex-girlfriend. Actually I was brought up in a very chauvinist, traditional Chinese male way, but at heart I guess I'm just not a macho guy. I'm not going to be John Woo. Strong women attract me in real life, and in dramatic context. A strong woman, when her heart is broken, it breaks my heart. It's something that speaks for me very well. When there are such characters in the text, I just tend to grab them. I don't know why. It's just chemistry find that I do a much better job with strong female characters than anything else. Somehow in Asia, I notice, women make up 80 per cent of my audience. So you see women with crouching men sitting next to them [pulls the face of a very quiet, small man]maybe at The Wedding Banquet you'll see a couple of guys. I think it is also a refreshing angle to check into repressed male-dominated society. Particularly for this one, which is a very macho genre, it just gives a different angle. There is a deeper emotional depth because we are taking an emotional tour with the heroines. I just like that. It's the best thing I can offer, I suppose. [Listen to the soundclip (2 mins 25) Q: Could you speak about the fight sequence in the forest at the end of the movie - how long did it take? AL: It took two weeks to shoot that scene. Most of it is on the editing floor. . . it was just a crazy idea that I had and everyone refused to do it for months. There is no shortage of swordfighting in bamboo forests, because bamboo provides a very romantic environment. In China, bamboo symbolises righteousness - it shoots straight up, it's elastic, like the swordsmanship. Also it provides a very interesting foreground. But normally no-one ever gets up there because it's undo-able. That's why I wanted to do it. The colour of green is really the Hidden Dragon for me in the movie, against the colour of red in the desert flashback. The crouching one, the forbidden one to me is really green. The Green Destiny, Jade-eyed Fox. Anything green, with a little bit of white, is very sexy and taboo-ish for me. So I thought the bamboo choreographed sequence really, in an abstract way, is mesmerising. It's not really a fight. I thought it was a good place to do it. You know, we live in a place with gravity. I sort of underestimate that. It's very painful for the actors and I worry about their safety. They were down in the bamboo forest in the southern part of China, in the valleys. It's hard to get a big construction crane in there. We managed to get four or five in there and hang the actors up. There's the valley and the creek, so they're really high up there, and we had to build platforms for the tighter shots. Once you cut the bamboo, the leaves dwindle. Only on drizzling days can you shoot for half an hour, then you have to change the bamboo again. It's really painful But it's a crazy idea. Q: I wasn't really sure about the flashback scenes. Why did you spend so long in the desert when it didn't seem to be crucial to the film? And also, how does scriptwriting work in terms of there having to be a constant translation between English and Chinese? JS: I can answer the first question about the flashback: It's a big mistake, we're sorry. [Laughter] It was a very big topic for us. In general, every time I see the movie, which is less and less (but he [Ang Lee] sits through it all the time!) I think, 'I can't believe we got away with this!' All of a sudden, for 20 minutes, they go back there. . . and it's completely unapologetic, it's like cut/back, cut/back. We're ready to take it on the chin a bit, hence my feistiness. But there are a lot of reasons why we love the flashback. But I'll tell you a little about the scriptwriting process. It was extremely educational for me, and extremely painful for Ang. We started with a Chinese-language draft, and then Ang made a precis of the parts of the fourth volume that were most important to him. Then I wrote this completely entertaining swash-buckling romantic adventurous epic movie, that was a joke to the Chinese who reading it. I use the analogy that if a Chinese person wrote a John Wayne western, and he rides into town, gets off his horse, walks over to the sheriff, says 'Howdy' and then, like, kow-tows nine times. . . [Laughter] But the structure was there. I think if I was Chinese it would be a nightmare parody of my entire culture. But structurally, I think, it still ended up working. Then Ang and Hui-Ling Huang really took it over and from inside-out really transformed the film, and really got into a lot of the cultural references, indices - the soul, which I had misread. Even though I'd read a lot of Chinese stuff in English translation and seen a lot of movies, I misread almost every cue. So it was great that the process became six months of mutual torture through bad translation . . .can you imagine trying to write your script and have somebody who had been fired from the UN doing bad translation? . . . I always thought we were going to make a movie that was understandable to westerners, but still very Chinese, and I still think essentially it's a Chinese film. But in a way I also recognise that why the film has been so massively successful in Asia is not because it retained its Asian identity, but because of all these wonderful new things that came about in discourse with the west. Especially in regards to the female characters and the romance, which are very foreign to the genre. I think that one of the things I find people responding to here in the west is precisely the fact that you get to see a two-hour Taoist action movie. The Chinese-ness of it, even if it's not always entirely comprehensible because of the subtitles, I think that's what's so profoundly new about it. So in a way we ended up making an eastern movie for western audiences and in some ways a more western movie for eastern audiences. [Listen to the soundclip] (2 mins 27) AL: To me, James is the best writer I personally know of. Take this film, it has to hit Asia like a summer blockbuster, but at the same time it has to be in the art-house cinemas and the New York Film Festival. So from the New York Film Festival to Asian blockbuster is a big range to cover. James doesn't know Chinese, but the structure and the film logic and the sellability, marketability and the pure grade of how good the script is. I do need his help, that's just the bottom line. It's painful for me to say so, but Goddamn it, it's so true. Q: I just have a comment, not a question. I found Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon exhilarating and profoundly moving. I want to say thank you. NN: I've seen it twice and I think it's the most amazing film I've seen in a long time. Thank you James Schamus and Ang Lee. Sound clips 'I don't care about writing really.

      "body": "<p><strong>NN:</strong> Let's start with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This is based on the fourth of a five-part novel sequence, a sort of Chinese Pulp Fiction. At what stage did you see the possibility of a film within this?</p> <p> <strong>AL:</strong> I read the book through a friend of mine who knew I was a fan of this particular writer in 1994. The fourth volume, which is the story of a young girl, Jen, struck me that there was a movie there. When there is a strong woman character in a story - that always grabs me. Especially in this very macho genre, which since boyhood I've wanted to do. It felt as if it took six movies for me to even begin to earn the right to make this kind of movie. Of course, I'm growing up, I'm an established film-maker, known for making family dramas about personal relationships, I cannot go all the way and make a purely genre film, I've got to throw everything I know into the movie - like a combination platter. The key is to keep the balance. </p> <p>I think the book struck me in a few ways that I thought very interesting to pick it as my first martial arts film. It has a very strong female character and it was very abundant in classic Chinese textures. Usually these pulp fiction books are set aside from the lawful society - they create a world called Giang Hu, which is an entanglement, a relationship with the underworld, with swordsmanship - almost like a fairytale. But this one is not quite that way, it is very abundant in what I care about - and also to do with the process of Chinese history, which has been lost, classic Chinese textures, which I know from history, my parents, from movies. It gives the impression of China which is kind of like the hidden dragon in me, in some ways, and I feel I want to pursue it. </p> <p>At the same time I was offered Sense and Sensibility - I couldn't refuse that job, it was just too good a job - so I made that. Meanwhile, the Ice Storm was still in development, And that was something I really wanted to do, and frankly I don't think I was ready to do a big production like this. Then I did another movie, Ride with the Devil, and then I thought I was ready. Going back after three major league productions, English-language films, including one somewhat action film, Ride with the Devil, I thought I was ready. I was, you know, tougher. And then James can tell you about the scripting process. There's the script and financing. Meanwhile, I went to Beijing and started to do location scouting. It's a process of two years. Five, six months of pre-production, then five months of shooting and five months of post-production and then seven or eight months in promotions.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> The remarkable thing about this being a Chinese production is that there are resonant myths with the west. For example, the Green Destiny sword can be compared to Excalibur in Arthurian legend. And there seem to be bits of Hamlet dotted all over the film. Was this embedded in the text itself, or was it something you drew out in order to make it more universal?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I think people are universal. I took the name Green Destiny from - well there is such a sword called Green Destiny. It is green because you keep twisting it, it's an ancient skill, you keep twisting it and knocking it and twisting it until it is very elastic and light. Swoosh! It swings like that, you know? </p> <p>Green Destiny is a name which is derived from the book, and I took the name and I go further with the Taoist philosophy. The jade fox - the old green, the murky green that's what the green really means. It is the ultimate yin-ness. Yin and yan where everything exists in and derives from. . . this is hard to explain. The most mysterious feminine factor, the existence that we men, we don't know. It's woman. It's feminine. That's what the sword is about. That's the symbolic meaning of the sword. Even in Chinese you probably don't get that. . . I don't know. But that's for me. Anything green is hidden dragon, desires and repression. . . something weird when you dig into the depth. I think there is something like that in Excalibur, for example. . .</p> <p>We didn't exactly have that in mind for a western audience. For a western audience, I think between James and me, the bouncing passing forth between Chinese and English, I think it is a good exercise to make it reasonable for a worldwide audience - not just a western audience - a worldwide audience and to some degree a modern Chinese audience as well. Things and logic that we used to take for granted in the Orient might not be that logical today. It's a good exam - how to tell a story with a global sense. That means more layout of the texture of society, more explanation of rules of the games. For example, the first fight does not ensue until 15 minutes into the movie. To a Chinese audience it must feel like 30 minutes - 'Are we gonna see a fight or what?' Usually with this genre the first thing that happens is a good fight sequence to show that you're in good hands. So we broke that rule. I think a lot of that comes from the western audience. </p> <p>I also I didn't want to make just a martial arts film, you know, there's drama in it. I think there is somewhat of a western three-act structure that lays things out. Starting with a crisis or an action, things like that, or verbalising a relationship. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> James, I know you've worked on all of Ang's scripts, aside from Sense and Sensibility, but you've worked on all of Ang's films. But never anything like this. What sort of a challenge was it for you to tackle the stunt aspect of the script?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> It was an amazing challenge, because in fact I didn't do it. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>On the first draft of the script I had a little preamble. As you go through the scenes and get to the fight scene, I remember exactly the language I used - 'They fight'. The preamble said, 'While I fail to explain the fight scenes, I can assure you that they will be the greatest fight scenes ever written in cinema history. Period.' And that was our pitch to the distributors we were selling the film to at that time. I knew two things. One was that Ang was going to insist on crafting fight sequences that were not simply the kind of western fight sequences where there's a bad guy who wants to kill the good guy, while the good guy doesn't really want to kill the bad guy - but in the fight the bad guy gets the upper hand, and it looks like the good guy's going to die, but at the last minute the good guy kills the bad guy. Only he doesn't kill the bad guy he just disables him, then the bad guy finally gets out of the tub with the knife and the good guy has to kill him. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>So I knew that they were going to be expressions of relationships and meaningful. Because in most of the fights in this movie, one person really doesn't want to fight. So it's a really interesting situation, having to make dramatic fight scenes when they are more or less than that. So I knew that Ang, and in particular our martial arts choreographer, Yuen Woo-Ping, would work all this stuff out on set in pre-production. It's one of those great ironies that when we mention Yuen Woo-Ping over here in the west it's always suffixed by 'of The Matrix fame'. Because he did do the choreography for The Matrix, which we loved, but of course we know him as the guy who created Jackie Chan's career and Jet Li's career. And it's amazing to see 30 years later, full circle, the cultures revolving, and so Yuen Woo-Ping returns to us as the guy who did The Matrix.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> As the film was being put together there were reports about the different castings. I gather that Jet Li was in fact considered for the main role and I understand that you were planning two language versions - one in English and one in Mandarin. Is that true?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> That was just a thought. Is it do-able? I don't know. Has anyone done it before? I don't know. It seemed to be a waste of time to shoot two versions. Am I going to direct them with equal intensity? All of the actors had better Chinese than English. Are they going to struggle with their English? Production-wise it doesn't make sense. Unless there were, like, 50 lines in the movie, then maybe I could manage to do that. But there are too many lines in the movie. So I decided not to do that and stick with Mandarin.</p> <p>Yeah, Jet Li, the first thing you think about when doing a martial arts film is him. But at that time it was a much smaller project, I really intended to make the movie as Sense and Sensibility with martial arts [laughs]. . . a two woman story. . . So the men are just generally supporting roles, just a touch, just a vehicle for their romance and conflict. So Jet Li was invited . . . but it didn't work out. . . </p> <p>Anyway, Chow Yun-Fat was the next big movie star. I don't see that as a Jackie Chan part.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>Chow Yun-Fat said he will never play a period piece. Will never shave his head and have a ponytail. He's never held a sword before. But I know he's a good actor, and drop-dead gorgeous and everything, so I show him the script and, at that stage, he is willing to take the job. So I was very moved. So he is not going to do tumbling and all kinds of fantastic Jet Li-styles of fighting, so the fighting gets reduced and his part gets really beefed-up. His relation with Michelle Yeoh really gets beefed up, and the part really becomes a romantic lead. I think, thinking back, we were lucky to have him. The movie is more a romantic drama. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> So the fact that you cast him changed the emotional weight of the movie?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Yes. I always do that. Sometimes it happens in the writing, sometimes in the directing. Like Zhang Zi-Yi, the young girl, she didn't turn out to be the way I see the part, so I have to veer the movie towards her and make it work. I think I am the actors' tailor. As far as casting is concerned, until the last moment of the music is composed, the job is not done. The whole process is casting. You have to make them look like they're perfectly cast. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Your last four films have been based on novels. Rick Moody's The Ice Storm, Austen's Sense and Sensibility and Daniel Woodrell's book Woe to Live On and now this. When you have a source material to work from, do you think in a different way when you approach the script? James?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Oh, me?</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Well, both of you. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It's running out of things to write about. That's why I adapt. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Well essentially it means I can get away with a first draft just by ripping off somebody else. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>Which is a great comfort. Because that first stage is just going through and underlining all the juicy bits and then trying to run them in some kind of order that makes sense cinematically. Then the hard part actually does take over, and you realise that novels don't simply translate into movies. Assuming that the world the novel created for you is the basis for the enjoyment of the script and the film is a deadly error. Because that world doesn't exist once you're dealing in cinematic terms - you have to create it every step of the way. It's like film production itself. </p> <p>My partner Ted Hope, at Good Machine, who started as an assistant director, the guy who ran the set, used to say it's like a Phillip K Dick novel, if you don't think about the floor, it's not there and you fall through it. And to a certain extent it's the same adapting novels, you suddenly realise you've forgotten what you need to do to make it into a movie. So it's an interesting process, it's a good process for lazy people, because the first stage is so easy, and it's a good process for procrastinators, because you already have a draft before you even start thinking about making a movie.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Does this mean that we're not going to have any more original Ang Lee scripts?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> There could be an original James Schamus script. . . I don't care about writing really. When I started out, nobody gave me scripts, so I had to write. . . That's why I wrote family drama - I'm a domestic person, it's all I know! Now I'm kind of established as a director, I much prefer directing to writing. Writing's lonely. Directing, I get all kinds of inspiration. It's working with people. It's a lot more fun. When I have a full schedule like that, I don't see myself sitting there for a couple of months, doing the research, going through a painful process, it's just not my thing anymore. I grab the life I have to direct as many movies as I can. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/1.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (58 seconds)</p> <p> <strong>NN:</strong> Let's look at that early stage, about 1985. You were at NYU film school, you had a couple of scripts, you were not being able to get films made. So you sent two scripts into a competition run by the Taiwanese government. These scripts were Pushing Hands, which won the first prize, and The Wedding Banquet, which won second prize. Not a bad way to start! That gave you the impetus to get a film made. Enter Good Machine, James's company. How did that meeting of minds come about?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> When I sent those scripts, that was the lowest point of my life. We'd just had our second son, and when I went to collect them from hospital, I went to the bank to try and get some money to buy some diapers, the screen showed I've got $26 left. Terrible. Anyway, my first Chinese script was The Wedding Banquet, it was written six years before it was made into a film. At that time making a Chinese-language film in America was inconceivable, no-one would give me money, no matter how small it was. And it was gay-related subject matter, so I couldn't raise the money in Taiwan either, so it just sat there. </p> <p>Then at the end of 1989 a friend of mine saw an advert that that year they were expanding the script competition to off-sea Chinese. The top award was equivalent to $16,000 - good money. I had this idea of Pushing Hands and the old Tai-Chi master for a long time but I never wanted to write it. I felt like in that six years I was sitting there like an old Tai-Chi master at home, going nowhere.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>I never meant to make that movie, but I know that if I write that movie I can win the top prize from the Taiwanese government. So I wrote it for the sake of the competition. So I won it, and they sent me a ticket to receive the prize in Taiwan. So when I arrive they say, the studio, that they want to make three movies. It's related to the government, called Central Motion Pictures, and it had just changed management. They say they want to make three movies, one is going to be done by a new director, we know we're going to lose money so just do what you want.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>'The American wife in that part? Just don't choose anyone too ugly.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>A third of the budget was funded by the government, a third is a video package deal they had, so there's only equivalent to $100,000 investment, so they said go ahead and do it. The story was set in New York, and I took the money, but I said, 'Give me a couple of days, I dunno if I want to do it.' I'd been waiting 10 years. . . I didn't want to make a flop. Anyway, I took the money and I was looking for a line producer, and through a friend of mine I knew Ted. And then there was Ted and James at the new-found Good Machine. They shared two tables with another company, I think. So I did my pitch. And they did their pitch. They told me that they were the kings of no-budget film-making in New York.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>James looked like a used-car salesman and a professor. . . And they said, 'Pay attention. We said 'no-budget' not 'low-budget'. Your money, about $400,000. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> 350</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> '$350,000 is luxury for us.' They offered something very tempting to me. They said they were director-centered producers. They wanted to teach the directors how to make the movies that they can afford instead of spending time in development hell - and I'd just spent six years in there. . . so I know how that tastes. And over the years I'm just glad that these two guys, I'm just glad they're not crooks!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>And they did keep their promise. They did grow together with me and they still teach me how to make the movie I can afford. All the movies you see - small ones, bigger ones. . . they fumble along the way like I do. They're learning how to deal with bigger people and different situations, international money-raising and sales. The first movie, Pushing Hands, didn't make any money except in Taiwan, so James said, 'Let me help you with the script for the second one.' And that hit. The Wedding Banquet was international, and we were capable of doing one after another, Chinese, English. . . It is a very fruitful and nurturing relationship that we get to grow together. I now want them to teach me how to make Terminator 3. . . </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/1.ra\">'I don't care about writing really.

Especially in this very macho genre, which since boyhood I've wanted to do. It felt as if it took six movies for me to even begin to earn the right to make this kind of movie. Of course, I'm growing up, I'm an established film-maker, known for making family dramas about personal relationships, I cannot go all the way and make a purely genre film, I've got to throw everything I know into the movie - like a combination platter. The key is to keep the balance. I think the book struck me in a few ways that I thought very interesting to pick it as my first martial arts film. It has a very strong female character and it was very abundant in classic Chinese textures. Usually these pulp fiction books are set aside from the lawful society - they create a world called Giang Hu, which is an entanglement, a relationship with the underworld, with swordsmanship - almost like a fairytale. But this one is not quite that way, it is very abundant in what I care about - and also to do with the process of Chinese history, which has been lost, classic Chinese textures, which I know from history, my parents, from movies. It gives the impression of China which is kind of like the hidden dragon in me, in some ways, and I feel I want to pursue it. At the same time I was offered Sense and Sensibility - I couldn't refuse that job, it was just too good a job - so I made that. Meanwhile, the Ice Storm was still in development, And that was something I really wanted to do, and frankly I don't think I was ready to do a big production like this. Then I did another movie, Ride with the Devil, and then I thought I was ready. Going back after three major league productions, English-language films, including one somewhat action film, Ride with the Devil, I thought I was ready. I was, you know, tougher. And then James can tell you about the scripting process. There's the script and financing. Meanwhile, I went to Beijing and started to do location scouting. It's a process of two years. Five, six months of pre-production, then five months of shooting and five months of post-production and then seven or eight months in promotions. NN: The remarkable thing about this being a Chinese production is that there are resonant myths with the west. For example, the Green Destiny sword can be compared to Excalibur in Arthurian legend. And there seem to be bits of Hamlet dotted all over the film. Was this embedded in the text itself, or was it something you drew out in order to make it more universal? AL: I think people are universal. I took the name Green Destiny from - well there is such a sword called Green Destiny. It is green because you keep twisting it, it's an ancient skill, you keep twisting it and knocking it and twisting it until it is very elastic and light. Swoosh! It swings like that, you know? Green Destiny is a name which is derived from the book, and I took the name and I go further with the Taoist philosophy. The jade fox - the old green, the murky green that's what the green really means. It is the ultimate yin-ness. Yin and yan where everything exists in and derives from. . . this is hard to explain. The most mysterious feminine factor, the existence that we men, we don't know. It's woman. It's feminine. That's what the sword is about. That's the symbolic meaning of the sword. Even in Chinese you probably don't get that. . . I don't know. But that's for me. Anything green is hidden dragon, desires and repression. . . something weird when you dig into the depth. I think there is something like that in Excalibur, for example. . . We didn't exactly have that in mind for a western audience. For a western audience, I think between James and me, the bouncing passing forth between Chinese and English, I think it is a good exercise to make it reasonable for a worldwide audience - not just a western audience - a worldwide audience and to some degree a modern Chinese audience as well. Things and logic that we used to take for granted in the Orient might not be that logical today. It's a good exam - how to tell a story with a global sense. That means more layout of the texture of society, more explanation of rules of the games. For example, the first fight does not ensue until 15 minutes into the movie. To a Chinese audience it must feel like 30 minutes - 'Are we gonna see a fight or what?' Usually with this genre the first thing that happens is a good fight sequence to show that you're in good hands. So we broke that rule. I think a lot of that comes from the western audience. I also I didn't want to make just a martial arts film, you know, there's drama in it. I think there is somewhat of a western three-act structure that lays things out. Starting with a crisis or an action, things like that, or verbalising a relationship. NN: James, I know you've worked on all of Ang's scripts, aside from Sense and Sensibility, but you've worked on all of Ang's films. But never anything like this. What sort of a challenge was it for you to tackle the stunt aspect of the script? JS: It was an amazing challenge, because in fact I didn't do it. [Laughter] On the first draft of the script I had a little preamble. As you go through the scenes and get to the fight scene, I remember exactly the language I used - 'They fight'. The preamble said, 'While I fail to explain the fight scenes, I can assure you that they will be the greatest fight scenes ever written in cinema history. Period.' And that was our pitch to the distributors we were selling the film to at that time. I knew two things. One was that Ang was going to insist on crafting fight sequences that were not simply the kind of western fight sequences where there's a bad guy who wants to kill the good guy, while the good guy doesn't really want to kill the bad guy - but in the fight the bad guy gets the upper hand, and it looks like the good guy's going to die, but at the last minute the good guy kills the bad guy. Only he doesn't kill the bad guy he just disables him, then the bad guy finally gets out of the tub with the knife and the good guy has to kill him. [Laughter] So I knew that they were going to be expressions of relationships and meaningful. Because in most of the fights in this movie, one person really doesn't want to fight. So it's a really interesting situation, having to make dramatic fight scenes when they are more or less than that. So I knew that Ang, and in particular our martial arts choreographer, Yuen Woo-Ping, would work all this stuff out on set in pre-production. It's one of those great ironies that when we mention Yuen Woo-Ping over here in the west it's always suffixed by 'of The Matrix fame'. Because he did do the choreography for The Matrix, which we loved, but of course we know him as the guy who created Jackie Chan's career and Jet Li's career. And it's amazing to see 30 years later, full circle, the cultures revolving, and so Yuen Woo-Ping returns to us as the guy who did The Matrix. NN: As the film was being put together there were reports about the different castings. I gather that Jet Li was in fact considered for the main role and I understand that you were planning two language versions - one in English and one in Mandarin. Is that true? AL: That was just a thought. Is it do-able? I don't know. Has anyone done it before? I don't know. It seemed to be a waste of time to shoot two versions. Am I going to direct them with equal intensity? All of the actors had better Chinese than English. Are they going to struggle with their English? Production-wise it doesn't make sense. Unless there were, like, 50 lines in the movie, then maybe I could manage to do that. But there are too many lines in the movie. So I decided not to do that and stick with Mandarin. Yeah, Jet Li, the first thing you think about when doing a martial arts film is him. But at that time it was a much smaller project, I really intended to make the movie as Sense and Sensibility with martial arts [laughs]. . . a two woman story. . . So the men are just generally supporting roles, just a touch, just a vehicle for their romance and conflict. So Jet Li was invited . . . but it didn't work out. . . Anyway, Chow Yun-Fat was the next big movie star. I don't see that as a Jackie Chan part. [Laughter] Chow Yun-Fat said he will never play a period piece. Will never shave his head and have a ponytail. He's never held a sword before. But I know he's a good actor, and drop-dead gorgeous and everything, so I show him the script and, at that stage, he is willing to take the job. So I was very moved. So he is not going to do tumbling and all kinds of fantastic Jet Li-styles of fighting, so the fighting gets reduced and his part gets really beefed-up. His relation with Michelle Yeoh really gets beefed up, and the part really becomes a romantic lead. I think, thinking back, we were lucky to have him. The movie is more a romantic drama. NN: So the fact that you cast him changed the emotional weight of the movie? AL: Yes. I always do that. Sometimes it happens in the writing, sometimes in the directing. Like Zhang Zi-Yi, the young girl, she didn't turn out to be the way I see the part, so I have to veer the movie towards her and make it work. I think I am the actors' tailor. As far as casting is concerned, until the last moment of the music is composed, the job is not done. The whole process is casting. You have to make them look like they're perfectly cast. NN: Your last four films have been based on novels. Rick Moody's The Ice Storm, Austen's Sense and Sensibility and Daniel Woodrell's book Woe to Live On and now this. When you have a source material to work from, do you think in a different way when you approach the script? James? JS: Oh, me? NN: Well, both of you. . . [Laughter] AL: It's running out of things to write about. That's why I adapt. . . JS: Well essentially it means I can get away with a first draft just by ripping off somebody else. . . [Laughter] Which is a great comfort. Because that first stage is just going through and underlining all the juicy bits and then trying to run them in some kind of order that makes sense cinematically. Then the hard part actually does take over, and you realise that novels don't simply translate into movies. Assuming that the world the novel created for you is the basis for the enjoyment of the script and the film is a deadly error. Because that world doesn't exist once you're dealing in cinematic terms - you have to create it every step of the way. It's like film production itself. My partner Ted Hope, at Good Machine, who started as an assistant director, the guy who ran the set, used to say it's like a Phillip K Dick novel, if you don't think about the floor, it's not there and you fall through it. And to a certain extent it's the same adapting novels, you suddenly realise you've forgotten what you need to do to make it into a movie. So it's an interesting process, it's a good process for lazy people, because the first stage is so easy, and it's a good process for procrastinators, because you already have a draft before you even start thinking about making a movie. NN: Does this mean that we're not going to have any more original Ang Lee scripts? AL: There could be an original James Schamus script. . . I don't care about writing really. When I started out, nobody gave me scripts, so I had to write. . . That's why I wrote family drama - I'm a domestic person, it's all I know! Now I'm kind of established as a director, I much prefer directing to writing. Writing's lonely. Directing, I get all kinds of inspiration. It's working with people. It's a lot more fun. When I have a full schedule like that, I don't see myself sitting there for a couple of months, doing the research, going through a painful process, it's just not my thing anymore. I grab the life I have to direct as many movies as I can. [Listen to the soundclip] (58 seconds) NN: Let's look at that early stage, about 1985. You were at NYU film school, you had a couple of scripts, you were not being able to get films made. So you sent two scripts into a competition run by the Taiwanese government. These scripts were Pushing Hands, which won the first prize, and The Wedding Banquet, which won second prize. Not a bad way to start! That gave you the impetus to get a film made. Enter Good Machine, James's company. How did that meeting of minds come about? AL: When I sent those scripts, that was the lowest point of my life. We'd just had our second son, and when I went to collect them from hospital, I went to the bank to try and get some money to buy some diapers, the screen showed I've got $26 left. Terrible. Anyway, my first Chinese script was The Wedding Banquet, it was written six years before it was made into a film. At that time making a Chinese-language film in America was inconceivable, no-one would give me money, no matter how small it was. And it was gay-related subject matter, so I couldn't raise the money in Taiwan either, so it just sat there. Then at the end of 1989 a friend of mine saw an advert that that year they were expanding the script competition to off-sea Chinese. The top award was equivalent to $16,000 - good money. I had this idea of Pushing Hands and the old Tai-Chi master for a long time but I never wanted to write it. I felt like in that six years I was sitting there like an old Tai-Chi master at home, going nowhere. [Laughter] I never meant to make that movie, but I know that if I write that movie I can win the top prize from the Taiwanese government. So I wrote it for the sake of the competition. So I won it, and they sent me a ticket to receive the prize in Taiwan. So when I arrive they say, the studio, that they want to make three movies. It's related to the government, called Central Motion Pictures, and it had just changed management. They say they want to make three movies, one is going to be done by a new director, we know we're going to lose money so just do what you want. [Laughter] 'The American wife in that part? Just don't choose anyone too ugly.' [Laughter] A third of the budget was funded by the government, a third is a video package deal they had, so there's only equivalent to $100,000 investment, so they said go ahead and do it. The story was set in New York, and I took the money, but I said, 'Give me a couple of days, I dunno if I want to do it.' I'd been waiting 10 years. . . I didn't want to make a flop. Anyway, I took the money and I was looking for a line producer, and through a friend of mine I knew Ted. And then there was Ted and James at the new-found Good Machine. They shared two tables with another company, I think. So I did my pitch. And they did their pitch. They told me that they were the kings of no-budget film-making in New York. [Laughter] James looked like a used-car salesman and a professor. . . And they said, 'Pay attention. We said 'no-budget' not 'low-budget'. Your money, about $400,000. . . JS: 350 AL: '$350,000 is luxury for us.' They offered something very tempting to me. They said they were director-centered producers. They wanted to teach the directors how to make the movies that they can afford instead of spending time in development hell - and I'd just spent six years in there. . . so I know how that tastes. And over the years I'm just glad that these two guys, I'm just glad they're not crooks! [Laughter] And they did keep their promise. They did grow together with me and they still teach me how to make the movie I can afford. All the movies you see - small ones, bigger ones. . . they fumble along the way like I do. They're learning how to deal with bigger people and different situations, international money-raising and sales. The first movie, Pushing Hands, didn't make any money except in Taiwan, so James said, 'Let me help you with the script for the second one.' And that hit. The Wedding Banquet was international, and we were capable of doing one after another, Chinese, English. . . It is a very fruitful and nurturing relationship that we get to grow together. I now want them to teach me how to make Terminator 3. . . Sound clips 'I don't care about writing really. Writing's lonely.'

      "body": "<p><strong>NN:</strong> James, are you still a professor at Columbia?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Yeah, I'm keeping the day job. . . I hooked up with Ted Hope - he dropped out of film school, or was kicked out, there's conflicting stories! . . But he worked his way up on set. I came out of the graduate programme in English Literature, I was a Miltonist, and then shifted into film theory at Berkeley and had no practical experience whatever. I realised that, when I came to New York, to be a producer you had to know how to use a phone and beg. That was a central ingredient to the package. And Ted brought the knowledge of how to make money once the begging had paid off. . . make the film I mean. So we had the wacky idea to get together, and in America, you know, more or less if you have a high-school equivalency diploma you can go and get a packet of business cards, and if you're Jo Schmo you're Jo Schmo Productions Inc. And that was us. </p> <p>Ted made a list of directors who had all made great short films but were yet to make features. He said we should really go after these folks, it was a really interesting list, and on it was Ang's name. Ang had made, six years prior, this wonderful short film called Fineline. I watched the film on tape and fell in love immediately. It was also Chazz Palminteri's first film. Just a fantastic movie. So, we called Ang's then agents and said, 'Hi, we're Ted and James of Good Machine, and we're interested in finding out what's up with Ang Lee. It seems to be a long time since he dropped off the face of the Earth.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>And they said, 'Oh, you no-budget guys.' (They'd read some article I'd written about no-budget-blah-blah-blah-bullshit.) And they said, \"You can't touch Ang. he's got development deals at this studio and all that, go away.' And it was only by coincidence through a mutual friend of Ted's that Ang showed up at our office two weeks later. He said, 'You probably don't know who I am. I'm Ang Lee.' Needless to say, he doesn't have those agents anymore.</p> <p>He gave his pitch. Of course, as you know, in Hollywood the pitch is a very rarified art form that usually takes between two and five minutes, usually involves the screenwriter getting up from his chair and doing some kind of interpretive dance and then the door opening at the right moment with the telegram from the stripper who says 'Ta-da!' You know, this kind of thing, and they have it all worked out. Ang's pitch lasted almost an hour.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>You can imagine it. And I was listening to this guy thinking, 'This guy will never, never get a job. It's not gonna happen.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But when he left, I turned to Ted and said, 'The weird thing about that pitch - aside from how boring it was - was the fact. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>'. . . was the fact that he didn't actually PITCH the movie. He DESCRIBED the movie.' He had already made the movie, and he was actually talking about a film. And we sat down together for about five minutes after Ang left, and we talked through how he actually talked about it, or at least that portion that we actually heard, and it was amazing that he was actually describing a film. This guy was actually a film-maker. It was one of these exciting moments, like in a bad 60s sitcom, where Ted goes and I go [does a double-thumbs-up with a broad grin]. And then we did the movie. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/2.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (2 mins 28)</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> There is a sense, Ang, that there is a sort of emotional arc to you movies. You start off light, with three comedies, and then move into something darker with Ice Storm. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Just for the record, I wrote that as a comedy. . . </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> But they were more ambiguous - Ride with the Devil and now this. I know that for you film-making is a major emotional investment. How does this reflect on the films you have made?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I think partly because I have grown older, and part of it is because I just got saturated - I just couldn't take those movies anymore. I think being successful for four movies was something out of my nature, and not much skill was involved. After The Wedding Banquet I was thinking of a change. You can see that in Eat Drink Man Woman, it's not darker, but it's more melancholy than the first two. The ending's more ambiguous. But what I really wanted to do at the time was The Ice Storm. Something less linear. Something more patchy, more like cubism. Something just 'kerck' [twists the air with his hands]. . . you know, give it a kick [pretends to stamp on something].</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But then I got offered Sense and Sensibility. I read it and wondered why they had sent the script to me. It's all about British introductions, somebody is introduced to somebody else and then. . . eight pages later so-and-so bows. . . so what did that have to do with me? But I was the guy that did social satire and family drama - that was how they saw Jane Austen should be interpreted and I was offered the job. I felt as if I know the world. . . really at heart, I know the material, except I have to do it in English with an English touch. So the cultural barrier and the major-league production was really the challenge, and I was ready to take the challenge. Of course, working with Emma Thompson was irresistible, and the film was to be made in England, not Hollywood, so I figured that was good natured. I still didn't know if we should do a $15m movie - probably we should do The Ice Storm first, somewhere around $4-8m. But then that week we saw some Hollywood movie and we thought, 'If a schmuck like that can make a movie, what are we afraid of?' So I took the job. After the success of Sense and Sensibility I just couldn't take it anymore, you know, the same tone anymore. Get so saturated by it. I don't know why I'm embarrassed about success. I just want to do a movie that could be a flop, maybe. . . </p> <p>I was very happy that I did that movie. In fact, I was very happy that I did all the movies I did. I was a very fortunate man. They are the movies. . . as long as I'm growing and working with these guys - they have a hard time, but I have a good time making those movies. And over the years they managed to pre-sell the film, so it reduces half the risk of the film. So I get to make those movies I want to make, with European territories as my backbones, and I can stretch the budget, and I could stretch the production value and the creative freedom and the kind of mass I can create. I enjoy it. </p> <p>Maybe the next thing, I'll try to get out of this tragic movie. But I'm very glad that I did this movie, that I have a better way of doing the tragic. I have to be conceptive, have to conceal in something I deliver so I don't give these guys such a hard time selling the movie [laughs]. I don't know. I just couldn't do Sense and Sensibility again. At least not for a while. There will be a time when I will be less cynical and I come back to have some pure fun.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> The broader significance of Crouching Tiger is that it could be one of the first foreign language films to break through the box-office in the west. We've had Il Postino or Life is Beautiful, maybe, but at the moment there is a definite sense that the really exciting work is all coming from the east. There are Asian film-makers leading the way. You think of the first wave, John Woo and Jackie Chan, and then another wave which is Ang, and Wong Kar-Wai, and Chen Kaige. They are starting to form a bridgehead in the west. Do either of you have any ideas as to why this situation should be at this particular time?</p> <p>[Ang and James look at each other, shrug and shake their heads]</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Maybe it's about time this happens. I'm just glad I'm part of the wave. I was born in a certain year. I waited six years, and it just happened. It also happened that our film industry took a dive. There was a time at the end of the 70s when no-one knew what to do anymore, so people got to make art films, which have to be personal to work in the first place, they have to be because they have no movie star, no big production value. Hong Kong is going through that change. . . Eventually it catches the eye of the art-house audience and, of course, the film festivals, and it becomes something filled with enthusiasm, the creative forces. . . we have a lot to say. It's not jaded yet. I think that's very. . . the reason you go to a movie is that you want to see something fresh. I think that's very exciting, creatively. These days you watch most mainstream American films and you see a beginning, a middle and an end. Some Chinese films, you still don't know what's going on at the end. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It's very exciting. I think this year, film-makers have become more mature individually, and that's a good sign, it's not a trend that will come and go. I think it could be the beginning of a good development. In terms of subtitled movies, I'm just glad. . . I hope that this movie will break art-house ghettos, not that it doesn't have artistic values, but I hope that we break that barrier. I grew up with subtitles. To us, reading subtitles is the mainstream. I just hope that the cultural exchange can be more bilateral, more even. There's a big world out there. People, you know, they have a lot of stories to tell. Just read the Goddamn subtitles! Enjoy movies! Join the world!

I watched the film on tape and fell in love immediately. It was also Chazz Palminteri's first film. Just a fantastic movie. So, we called Ang's then agents and said, 'Hi, we're Ted and James of Good Machine, and we're interested in finding out what's up with Ang Lee. It seems to be a long time since he dropped off the face of the Earth.' [Laughter] And they said, 'Oh, you no-budget guys.' (They'd read some article I'd written about no-budget-blah-blah-blah-bullshit.) And they said, \"You can't touch Ang. he's got development deals at this studio and all that, go away.' And it was only by coincidence through a mutual friend of Ted's that Ang showed up at our office two weeks later. He said, 'You probably don't know who I am. I'm Ang Lee.' Needless to say, he doesn't have those agents anymore. He gave his pitch. Of course, as you know, in Hollywood the pitch is a very rarified art form that usually takes between two and five minutes, usually involves the screenwriter getting up from his chair and doing some kind of interpretive dance and then the door opening at the right moment with the telegram from the stripper who says 'Ta-da!' You know, this kind of thing, and they have it all worked out. Ang's pitch lasted almost an hour. [Laughter] You can imagine it. And I was listening to this guy thinking, 'This guy will never, never get a job. It's not gonna happen.' [Laughter] But when he left, I turned to Ted and said, 'The weird thing about that pitch - aside from how boring it was - was the fact. . . [Laughter] '. . . was the fact that he didn't actually PITCH the movie. He DESCRIBED the movie.' He had already made the movie, and he was actually talking about a film. And we sat down together for about five minutes after Ang left, and we talked through how he actually talked about it, or at least that portion that we actually heard, and it was amazing that he was actually describing a film. This guy was actually a film-maker. It was one of these exciting moments, like in a bad 60s sitcom, where Ted goes and I go [does a double-thumbs-up with a broad grin]. And then we did the movie. [Listen to the soundclip] (2 mins 28) NN: There is a sense, Ang, that there is a sort of emotional arc to you movies. You start off light, with three comedies, and then move into something darker with Ice Storm. . . JS: Just for the record, I wrote that as a comedy. . . NN: But they were more ambiguous - Ride with the Devil and now this. I know that for you film-making is a major emotional investment. How does this reflect on the films you have made? AL: I think partly because I have grown older, and part of it is because I just got saturated - I just couldn't take those movies anymore. I think being successful for four movies was something out of my nature, and not much skill was involved. After The Wedding Banquet I was thinking of a change. You can see that in Eat Drink Man Woman, it's not darker, but it's more melancholy than the first two. The ending's more ambiguous. But what I really wanted to do at the time was The Ice Storm. Something less linear. Something more patchy, more like cubism. Something just 'kerck' [twists the air with his hands]. . . you know, give it a kick [pretends to stamp on something]. [Laughter] But then I got offered Sense and Sensibility. I read it and wondered why they had sent the script to me. It's all about British introductions, somebody is introduced to somebody else and then. . . eight pages later so-and-so bows. . . so what did that have to do with me? But I was the guy that did social satire and family drama - that was how they saw Jane Austen should be interpreted and I was offered the job. I felt as if I know the world. . . really at heart, I know the material, except I have to do it in English with an English touch. So the cultural barrier and the major-league production was really the challenge, and I was ready to take the challenge. Of course, working with Emma Thompson was irresistible, and the film was to be made in England, not Hollywood, so I figured that was good natured. I still didn't know if we should do a $15m movie - probably we should do The Ice Storm first, somewhere around $4-8m. But then that week we saw some Hollywood movie and we thought, 'If a schmuck like that can make a movie, what are we afraid of?' So I took the job. After the success of Sense and Sensibility I just couldn't take it anymore, you know, the same tone anymore. Get so saturated by it. I don't know why I'm embarrassed about success. I just want to do a movie that could be a flop, maybe. . . I was very happy that I did that movie. In fact, I was very happy that I did all the movies I did. I was a very fortunate man. They are the movies. . . as long as I'm growing and working with these guys - they have a hard time, but I have a good time making those movies. And over the years they managed to pre-sell the film, so it reduces half the risk of the film. So I get to make those movies I want to make, with European territories as my backbones, and I can stretch the budget, and I could stretch the production value and the creative freedom and the kind of mass I can create. I enjoy it. Maybe the next thing, I'll try to get out of this tragic movie. But I'm very glad that I did this movie, that I have a better way of doing the tragic. I have to be conceptive, have to conceal in something I deliver so I don't give these guys such a hard time selling the movie [laughs]. I don't know. I just couldn't do Sense and Sensibility again. At least not for a while. There will be a time when I will be less cynical and I come back to have some pure fun. NN: The broader significance of Crouching Tiger is that it could be one of the first foreign language films to break through the box-office in the west. We've had Il Postino or Life is Beautiful, maybe, but at the moment there is a definite sense that the really exciting work is all coming from the east. There are Asian film-makers leading the way. You think of the first wave, John Woo and Jackie Chan, and then another wave which is Ang, and Wong Kar-Wai, and Chen Kaige. They are starting to form a bridgehead in the west. Do either of you have any ideas as to why this situation should be at this particular time? [Ang and James look at each other, shrug and shake their heads] AL: Maybe it's about time this happens. I'm just glad I'm part of the wave. I was born in a certain year. I waited six years, and it just happened. It also happened that our film industry took a dive. There was a time at the end of the 70s when no-one knew what to do anymore, so people got to make art films, which have to be personal to work in the first place, they have to be because they have no movie star, no big production value. Hong Kong is going through that change. . . Eventually it catches the eye of the art-house audience and, of course, the film festivals, and it becomes something filled with enthusiasm, the creative forces. . . we have a lot to say. It's not jaded yet. I think that's very. . . the reason you go to a movie is that you want to see something fresh. I think that's very exciting, creatively. These days you watch most mainstream American films and you see a beginning, a middle and an end. Some Chinese films, you still don't know what's going on at the end. . . [Laughter] It's very exciting. I think this year, film-makers have become more mature individually, and that's a good sign, it's not a trend that will come and go. I think it could be the beginning of a good development. In terms of subtitled movies, I'm just glad. . . I hope that this movie will break art-house ghettos, not that it doesn't have artistic values, but I hope that we break that barrier. I grew up with subtitles. To us, reading subtitles is the mainstream. I just hope that the cultural exchange can be more bilateral, more even. There's a big world out there. People, you know, they have a lot of stories to tell. Just read the Goddamn subtitles! Enjoy movies! Join the world! [Listen to the soundclip] (47 seconds) NN: I think you said it all! Let's open it up to the audience. Sound clips 'I don't care about writing really. Writing's lonely.' (58 seconds) JS on Ang Lee's 'boring' pitch (2 mins 28) 'Just read the goddamn subtitles!

Four people were arrested in the vault of the dome\u2019s money zone. Two more were arrested \u201cin and around\u201d the river Thames, where the robbers had a powerboat waiting to speed them from the scene, Scotland Yard said, and armed police in Kent detained five more men. In scenes reminiscent of the James Bond film The World is Not Enough, the raiders used a bulldozer to break into the dome. But officers from Scotland Yard\u2019s elite Flying Squad knew in advance about the raid and were lying in wait. Scotland Yard said that the robbers used the earth digger to crash through the gates of the dome and enter the money zone where the diamonds were located. Police said that the intelligence-led operation had been planned for several months and involved more than 100 officers. Detective Superintendent Jon Shatford, who led the Flying Squad operation, said: \u201cIf this had been carried out in accordance with their wishes, this would have been the largest robbery in the world.\u201d A spokeswoman for De Beers\u2019s London office confirmed there had been an attempt to steal the Millennium Star and a collection of 12 blue diamonds, the Millennium Jewels, which are also on show. Kate Evan-Jones refused to discuss security measures for the gems at the dome, including whether they are left in the money zone overnight or removed for safety. The Millennium Star is \u201cpriceless\u201d because it is a flawless, pear-shaped 203-carat gem, said Ms Evan-Jones. \u201cIt is impossible to put a value on it because of its rarity and uniqueness.\u201d The Millennium Star played a central role in the opening ceremony for the dome on New Year\u2019s Eve.

They include a good selection of verbs, adjectives, buildings, vehicles, foods, time, objects, people, animals, sports and events. Less Commonly Taught **** LCTL awards grants for teachers who contribute to their collection of teaching materials. It also hosts a virtual picture album for various languages, audio-video archives and an Ask the Expert service. The definition of a \"less commonly-taught language\" is any language except English, French, German or Spanish. The World's Animals **** If you want to encourage learners to think about how different languages render onomatopoeic words, this is a good place to begin. Each of the 37 animals listed has a page with a picture, the pronunciation of the sound it makes in a range of languages, and usually a sound file. Languages also have their own page Very compelling. RNID Fingerspelling **** The Royal National Institute for Deaf People has relaunched its site. It's an invaluable resource for PSHE and citizenship projects, but the best feature is an interactive guide to fingerspelling. Highly impressive. Chinese Language *** A well-chosen selection of links for Chinese teachers and learners, including fonts, romanisation guidance, online radio and newspapers and teaching resources. Sabhal Mor Ostaig *** Run by an FE college on Skye, Sabhal Mor Ostaig acts as a focal point and resource centre for teachers of Gaelic in the rest of the world. BBC Scotland's Gaelic site at www.bbc.co.uk/alba is also very helpful. Russian UK *** This site is sttill under construction, but it's useful for its help with fonts, links and details of Russian exam syllabuses in Britain. RussNet *** A small and disparate assortment of links with a forum for Russian teachers. Scandanavian *** Hull university's link collection takes in Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish, and the university's own site is a rich source of information. Japanese Language ** As one would expect from the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, the site is more concerned with the task of learning and reading Japanese online than catering specifically for teachers. Probably the most useful feature is the guide to building your own Kanji study pages, although some browsers may have difficulties with rendering the Japanese characters.",

      "body": "<p>In breaktime at Abraham Moss High school in Greater Manchester last Friday, staff threw a party to celebrate the resignation of Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools. Copies of the Guardian's front page, \"Woodhead sent packing\", were neatly cut out and stuck up on the staffroom walls. Staff were whispering, \"fantastic, fantastic\" while pouring cups of tea. </p> <p>\"They've eaten 15 packets of my best biscuits and 8lbs of bananas and satsumas,\" said the head teacher, David Watchorn, who provided the food in the 20 minute break between lessons. Woodhead's bespectacled face looked down helplessly from the broadsheets stuck on the noticeboards while teachers clutching chocolate crunch creams laughed and said they wouldn't mind aiming spit at him. </p> <p>In a new version of the John F Kennedy/death of Diana moment, everyone could remember where they were when they heard the news. </p> <p>\"I was on my way home from school,\" said Madeleine Brierley, who teaches English. \"I had left late on be half of 120 pupils I had taken to the theatre. I was going to be late home because of all the work I had put into the trip. And I was delighted that while I had been working so hard, Woodhead, who had criticised teachers so heavily, had left. The other day, I was writing about inspections and my spell check rejected the word Ofsted, suggesting 'ousted'. Quite ironic really.\" </p> <p>Lynne Wilson, head of design technology, was up late, preparing work linked to inspections, when she heard about Woodhead's resignation. \"Sometimes I'll work until 1am, trying to do everything as well as possible because of Ofsted. I'm always thinking, 'prepare well, you never know what they'll pick up on'. When the news came on TV, my daughter brought me a cup of tea, and I smiled for the first time that day.\" </p> <p>Julie Rudge, a trainee teacher, spoke as a parent and a former parent governor. She said, \"When I heard the news on the radio, I responded as a parent first, trainee teacher second. As a mother, I recognise that his influence was not all negative. It is probably a good thing that schools have become more accountable, because as a parent, you obviously want the best for your child.\" </p> <p>But at the inner city comprehensive with over 1,000 pupils - 65% from ethnic minorities, and some who are refugees who have difficulties with English - elation among the 70 staff soon evaporated with the prospect of who would fill Woodhead's shoes and what would become of Ofsted. </p> <p>Assistant head teacher Pam Thompson, heard the news on the radio while she was driving home after a long, stressful day. \"I get into school at 7am and I'm not the first. Often I don't leave until 6pm and I'm not the last to go. The last time Ofsted inspected, the inspectors were in my class for 17 minutes. They made a judgement on me in just over a quarter of an hour. It wasn't all celebration at the thought of Woodhead leaving. I'm annoyed we have to wait until February for him to go. And there is a very strong chance we could end up with someone even worse.\" </p> <p>She said the \"Woodhead effect\" of moral-crushing criticism of teachers would last for a long time, and the only way to change Ofsted was to replace Woodhead with someone who had a concept of what teachers at the sharp end faced in schools. </p> <p>\"We encourage kids to work and succeed. We don't have a philosophy of punishing failing pupils. Teachers should have a leader for standards who is interested in what we deliver, not just criticism. I would like to see someone highlighting the positive,\" she said. </p> <p>Over the bakewell biscuits, a cluster of teachers said they would have preferred to have seen Woodhead sacked than resign. \"I would rather have seen his head on a plate,\" said one. \"There's a guillotine in my office, but I don't suppose his head would fit in it,\" said another. </p> <p> On the other side of Manchester, at Stamford High School, the staffroom made do without streamers and balloons but teachers said they would never forget the day they turned on the Today programme at 6am, while scrabbling in the dark to find their clothes, and heard that the most criticised member of the education establishment was leaving. </p> <p>Head teacher Phil Taylor cited Woodhead's continual comments on matters like standards in A-levels as an example of years of throwaway public comments that have undermined confidence in teachers and schools. </p> <p>\"This is why he will make a good columnist. It's clear that he will feel at home in a world of people who don't analyse, just shout their mouths off, as that is what he likes doing,\" Taylor said. </p> <p>Taylor speaks from the experience of a head who has worked in several different comprehensives and observed procedures at a school in \"special measures\". </p> <p>\"Students felt that the constant monitoring was harming them. They sensed that the teachers were always on display, and that they were not getting their real personalities, but a show. Staff were leaving because they were fed up with the pressure and students become very sensitive to that.\" </p> <p>Stewart Hankinson, head of music, who has taught for 20 years, said he was surprised to learn of Woodhead's resignation while flicking through Teletext. </p> <p>\"He put the teaching profession under a great deal of stress. I don't mind change, and I'm sure a lot of teachers think change is a good thing, but being faced with new initiatives all the time is difficult at ground level. I feel the next step for Ofsted must be a period of calm and reflection, to take stock of the whole inspection process.\" </p> <p>Many felt Woodhead should have gone earlier, especially when it was alleged that he had had an affair with a pupil while she was still at school. </p> <p>Peggy Saul, head of humanities said the government would have to review its education policy in the light of mixed messages teachers had been sent by Ofsted. She said on one hand, Tony Blair wanted to encourage applications to the profession, and on the other Woodhead had called for 15,000 failing teachers to quit. </p> <p>Saul, who has taught humanities to 11- to 18-year-olds in several schools, was on the way to an evening class in history when she heard of Woodhead's departure. </p> <p>\"I was heading to an evening class to improve my knowledge of my subject and to teach better. </p> <p>\"The government now has to start helping us regain the respect of students and parents that we lost during the Chris Woodhead years. All this criticism has altered perspectives to teachers and made our jobs much harder. Students are not brought up to respect teachers as they were in the past and that can make classes of adolescents hard to control, because they know how we are viewed. Woodhead is going but Ofsted still has a lot to answer for.\" </p> <p><strong>Don't leave me this way...</strong></p> <p>Judy Jones, assistant head at Cliffe Hill primary school in Halifax, is one of the few teachers we asked who said Thursday was a sad day. She had been settling down to watch Hope and Glory on the television when she heard the newsflash. \"I thought, they have finally got their way. They've got him out. I was very disappointed.\" Having met Woodhead, she felt he was \"a man who has his head screwed on right\". </p> <p>\"He is not an unapproachable person. He visited the school and the staff found him very pleasant. Generally, they are sad he is going, but we know it's politics.\" </p> <p>Jean Heslop, head of Cliffe Hill school and Mixenden school, also in Halifax, was at home by the time she heard the news. \"I felt sad, because I doubt whether he will get the accolade he deserves for bringing about development in schools.\" </p> <p>Heslop met Woodhead about four years ago when she contacted him in protest at his calls for 15,000 ineffective teachers to quit. She told him to come up to Halifax and experience life at the front line. He did, and they struck up a good professional relationship. Woodhead visited Cliffe Hill four weeks ago to open a new computer centre paid for with prize money from a national teaching award. </p> <p>\"Chris had an unenviable job,\" says Heslop. \"But on reflection he made a great number of improvements. Ofsted got a lot of things right, and positive things came out of Chris's methods of inspection. Schools and teachers have become more accountable.\" </p> <p>Heslop said she would like to see improvements at Ofsted after Woodhead's departure. National test results should reflect the involvement of the school and there should be more contextual evidence included in Ofsted reports. She said the expertise of Ofsted inspectors needed to be credible and matched to individual schools.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>BUNGED UP</strong></p> <p>Before we go any further, let's get this straight: there is no conspiracy between AC Milan and FC Barcelona. They have not been involved in breeding aliens to take over the running of their club shops. They have not siphoned billions of euros into a fund to back Ken Dodd's bid for the Irish presidency in 2005. They have not been cross-breeding cows with crocodiles in a bid to make tastier handbags. And they have certainly not made a pact to knock Leeds out of Big Cup.</p> <p>According to reports in the Spanish press, Barca had offered the Rossoneri \u00a31.6m in bonuses (boni??) if they beat David O'Leary's plucky tyros. But the Italian giants released a statement today which insisted: \"No official from Barcelona has put a proposal to AC Milan, its members and officials, relating to a \"reward\" for an eventual victory over Leeds United on Wednesday.\" The statement was signed by the club's vice-president, Adriano Galli, who is apparently pals with new Barca president Joan Gaspart - so he should know.</p> <p>But in the modern game, can you ever be sure of anything? When Milan coach Alberto Zaccheroni says, as he did today \"I don't even feel like commenting on the rumours. We will do all we can to win this game\", does he mean win the game so his players can win a bonus, or win the game so his club can acquit themselves professionally, finish top of their group, and avenge an unlucky last-minute defeat at Elland Road? Even the Fiver is beginning to feel a little unsteady. But one thing does remain certain: if Oliver Bierhoff scores with his feet tomorrow night, we're calling Interpol.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>KICKED TO THE KERB</strong></p> <p>It's the vacancy that every out of work member of the League Managers Association (president Kelvin Koogan) is talking about. And who cares if Bradford City already have one huge Geoffrey Richmond-sized boot in Division One? Not Howard Kendall, that's for sure. Or Steve Coppell. Or even Roy Evans. Because according to today's tabloids, all of these men are in the running for the vacant Valley Parade job. Understandably, the Fiver would love to see one - actually, all - of these workshy wasters getting off their arses and doing an honest day's work. But unfortunately there's just one problem - the man the Bantams really want is Tottenham's director of football, David Pleat.</p> <p>Which makes the Fiver a bit worried. You see when we first bumped into Mr Pleat, we couldn't help noticing how nervous and fidgety the man looked. Even his Ted from Hi-De-Hi quiff bobbled about shiftily, like a woman of ill-repute in the Luton night. \"But there's nothing illegal about two mature adults talking in Tottenham Hotspur's Bill Nicholson suite,\" the Fiver wanted to tell him. But unfortunately we didn't have enough breath to finish the sentence, and poor Pleat left the room. Would this lack of confidence one day scupper his chances of taking charge at a top northern club we wondered?</p> <p>Perhaps it already has. When the London Evening Standard reported that Pleat was in talks with chairman Richmond about the Bantams job, the Fiver was excited. Especially when Richmond started shouting that \"Stuart [McCall, caretaker Bantam boss] has made the point that he wants an experienced assistant.\" However, by this afternoon, the dream appeared to be over when Pleat shuffled out and told the world: \"I have spoken to no one from Bradford City.\" Which is a real shame.

Stuart Gates, managing director of Fortnum &amp; Mason, said: \"We wanted to maintain the quality of service for which we are renowned and if anything we have enhanced it to give online customers the complete Fortnum &amp; Mason service. \"The service allows Fortnum &amp; Mason to act as a local speciality store wherever the customer may be.\" Fortnum &amp; Mason offered a limited online shopping service last Christmas. Bamber Forsyth's director of interactive media, Mark Wilson, said: \"Last year the site was heavily used in the run-up to Christmas. This year customers will enjoy more choice, a streamlined shopping process and much better performance than last year.\"",

      "bodyText": "Fresh storms were forecast today across Britain as a record number of severe flood warnings was issued for more than 40 rivers. More householders were evacuated from their homes last night and police warned that further rain today would trigger more flooding and evacuations. The highest ever number of severe flood warnings were in place after the number of weather-related deaths over the last 10 days in Britain and Northern Ireland climbed to 12 at the weekend. The environment agency issued 45 of its most serious alerts across 41 rivers - with more affected than ever before. \"We are breaking records by the hour,\" said an agency spokeswoman. \"The worst-hit areas are Kent and Sussex, the north east and the Midlands.\" In Kent and Sussex, up to 2.7ins of rain fell in several areas yesterday and more heavy showers are expected today. Villagers in the Ashford area, who have so far escaped flooding, have been forced to consider whether they should move out or move upstairs. More than 1.3ins of rain has fallen in the area of the East Stour, near the villages of Mersham and Torrington, in the last 12 hours. This overfilled the Aldington storm reservoir and rising levels of flood water were pouring on to land near the isolated properties. The area around Ashford International Station, which is used by Eurostar, was also been flooded. The agency was also worried about low lying areas of Canterbury, particularly the Westgate area. In Yorkshire, emergency services have pinpointed the towns of Barlby and Selby as the main trouble spots later today, but believe York will not see water levels as high as last week. \"The problem for these towns is that they are situated south of York, where the rivers Ouse, Nidd and Wharfe have come together. The severe flood warnings here are still in place and we are expecting a peak some time after 4pm today,\" said an agency spokesman. Dozens of homes in the two towns have already been flooded, amid accusations from locals that they have been sacrificed to save York - a charge that has been denied by the emergency services. Police and Army officers have also advised scores of homeowners in two villages in North Yorkshire to evacuate their homes today. The officers toured the neighbouring villages of Beal and Birkin after the environment agency advised that both villages should be evacuated urgently, a police spokesman said. \"For some people we believe the worst is over, but for others it is still a case of take precautions and wait and see,\" added the spokeswoman. Persistent driving rain is forecast for much of northern Britain today, with the worst weather concentrated over Northern Ireland and Scotland before spreading into northern England. A band of heavy rain has been predicted for Northumberland, Yorkshire and Wales. The north-east was braced for further rain, with severe flood warnings remaining in place on the rivers Pont and Wansbeck in Northumberland, and evacuations taking place throughout the area. Heavy rain was also causing flood chaos across the east coast of Scotland. Roads were closed in several areas of Edinburgh, the Lothians, Fife and the Borders, where police warned motorists only to make essential journeys. Staffordshire Police said large parts of the town centre, including most car parks, were badly affected by flood waters after the River Sow burst its banks. Police and council staff erected barriers on several routes into the town centre where the situation is not likely to improve for at least 24 hours. The main road link between Brighton and London was closed this morning after flooding, causing rush-hour chaos. The A23 at Patcham, just north of Brighton, was closed by Sussex Police just before 8am after it flooded to a height of one foot. Traffic was diverted and thousands of cars were backed up on local roads. Interactive quiz Is this the end of the world? Talk about it Is global warming to blame?

Prince Charles, who has warned before of the dangers of regarding nature as something to be engineered for human convenience, weighed into the national debate over the flooding with a typical intervention about the dangers, as well as benefits, of scientific progress.

      "body": "<p>Apparently horses can sleep standing up with their eyes open. Now here's what really aggravates me: all the other people in the hospital, who aren't doctors, but who look after the same patients as me, go home at five every day. Occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, clinical nutrition specialists, ward clerks, x-ray secretaries, social workers, phlebotomists: with a few honourable exceptions, they are very careful to make a sharp exit. They plan their day around it. It wouldn't occur to them to stay, like I do, until half six, often beyond eight, until the patients are sorted. </p> <p>Once they leave the building, bang on time, two things happen. Firstly, if the job they would have done is urgent, and if it is within my power, I stay behind even longer to do it myself. Alternatively, if the job wasn't urgent (for example, a home visit to assess someone for services), the likely upshot is that the patient languishes in hospital for another day or two, increasing their daily chance of catching a hospital acquired infection that will knock them for six and be resistant to antibiotics, and denying the patients who are sleeping on stretchers in the corridors of casualty a safe and comfortable bed on a ward. </p> <p>Now there are many reasons why junior doctors are made to feel guilty about complaining about their long hours. The therapists who I listed above will tell me that I chose the hours when I chose the job (when I was at school aged 17, I suppose) and implicit in much of what they say is that I reap society's adulation and future financial rewards, and so I deserve to work myself into a psychiatric diagnosis. When they say this after I mention how awful I'm feeling on three hours sleep, and just as they're going home and telling me about the things they've \"not been able to fit in\" that day, it seems a tad insensitive, but maybe they have a point, and maybe they feel undervalued. </p> <p>Consultants, who worked even more bizarre hours in their day, will tell you that doctors need to accumulate clinical experience for their professional training, and given the nature of disease this takes time. This would all be very well if I spent my time practising clinical medicine, but as I may have already mentioned, in the daytime on the wards (as opposed to when I'm on call) I am a paperwork clerk, a machine for processing forms, a robot for carrying them from A to B, a St Bernard for seeking out lost x-rays in the radiology department, and a mobster's enforcer for bullying social workers into sorting out my patients. </p> <p>None of these learning opportunities will help me get my membership of the Royal College of Physicians in two years time. I love being on call, even all night. I would dearly love to work as a doctor, day in, day out, to absorb myself in the healing arts. If you took out all the parts of my job that should be done by someone else, and left me just doing the doctor stuff, on some days I'd be home by lunchtime. Then I could leave work early after a night on call. Or you could give me more patients to learn from. Either would be great. </p> <p>But there is another, darker reason why we have to work such long hours. Just as the other health professionals in the hospital know that they can ultimately rely on doctors to sort out the patients if they'd rather go home on time, so do the managers of the hospital trust. Why on earth would an organisation like a hospital, run by managers, want to employ an extra ward clerk, or a phlebotomist to take the bloods, for five pounds an hour, when a doctor will stay late and do it for free? Any organisation faced with such a priceless opportunity would be obliged to rip us off. </p> <p>So up and down the country this week, small conspiratorial bands of junior doctors were crouched in their squalid underground bunkers (sorry, I mean hospital accommodation) filling out their \"banding questionnaires\" to determine which pay scale their job will fall into. I don't know anyone who won't fall into the top one (more than 56 hours a week), although I know about plenty of hospitals that are trying to bribe and bully their doctors into lying on the form. </p> <p>Doctors will continue to work their ridiculous hours, albeit on higher pay, but ultimately the positive outcome will not be an improvement in their own personal finances: it will be a restructuring of the work that junior doctors perform. Because, since the pay for each band increases exponentially in relation to the lunacy of the workload, doctors will suddenly become a more costly resource than other staff (representing also the financial burden to the country of training one). And an overworked doctor will cost more, per hour, than two happy doctors. Doctors will finally get the deal they deserve, simply because cashflow is the only language that hospital managers will understand. </p>",

So up and down the country this week, small conspiratorial bands of junior doctors were crouched in their squalid underground bunkers (sorry, I mean hospital accommodation) filling out their \"banding questionnaires\" to determine which pay scale their job will fall into. I don't know anyone who won't fall into the top one (more than 56 hours a week), although I know about plenty of hospitals that are trying to bribe and bully their doctors into lying on the form. Doctors will continue to work their ridiculous hours, albeit on higher pay, but ultimately the positive outcome will not be an improvement in their own personal finances: it will be a restructuring of the work that junior doctors perform. Because, since the pay for each band increases exponentially in relation to the lunacy of the workload, doctors will suddenly become a more costly resource than other staff (representing also the financial burden to the country of training one). And an overworked doctor will cost more, per hour, than two happy doctors. Doctors will finally get the deal they deserve, simply because cashflow is the only language that hospital managers will understand.",

      "body": "<p>Holly Loach sits in her high chair. Her eyes burn with curiosity, her fingers are everywhere, but she is silent. I say hello, and there is no response. A few weeks ago Holly was as loud as they come, says her mother, Hannah. Back then she sang, she screamed, she babbled away. A few weeks - a lifetime. </p> <p>It was August bank holiday Monday when 16-month-old Holly became sick. She was hot, sleepy, lacklustre. \"She was just lying on her back not moving, which I had never seen before. She looked blank, spaced out,\" says her mother. When Holly went back to bed an hour later Hannah knew something was up. </p> <p>The GP's surgery was shut, so Hannah took her daughter to Seldoc, the emergency medical practice for south-east London. She was told that they had seen lots of children with the same virus, and that she would get through it. Hannah was worried because Holly wasn't eating or drinking. The doctor said that food wasn't important as long as she was taking fluids. They went home. Holly continued to refuse liquid. Hannah and her partner, Mike, took her to the GP on the Tuesday morning. The doctor examined the little girl's ears, eyes and throat, prescribed paracetamol suppositories, and fitted this advice neatly into a five-minute appointment slot. </p> <p>By Tuesday evening, there was no change. \"She was like a ball of fire,\" says Mike. The surgery was closed, so Hannah returned to Seldoc where another doctor told her that she had nothing to worry about, but she would refer her to King's College Hospital just to put her mind at rest. </p> <p>As it turned out, there was nothing soothing about the visit to King's: only a series of increasingly distressing, infuriating, and perplexing, delays. Hannah had been told to go straight to the ward, so by the time she was sent back to casualty, another hour had been wasted. Despite Hannah's obvious concern, she was told to take a number and that she would have to wait to see a nurse. \"There were only four ahead of us so I thought that would be fine, but we sat waiting for an hour and 20 minutes. I kept going over and saying, 'I'm really worried,' but I was just told to wait my turn.\" After seeing the assessment nurse they waited for the paediatrician. \"Eventually someone came and started taking notes, and after about 10 or 15 questions I realised she was working from the wrong notes. She said, 'So Holly's four months old?' and I said no.\" </p> <p>The doctor told Hannah they would test Holly's urine. Hannah asked how, given that Holly had not had anything to drink for two days - they were then left in the cubicle for the best part of two hours, by which time it was midnight. </p> <p>By now Hannah was panicking. She went over to a doctor, waited until she had finished making her notes and asked if she could please have a word. \"She just completely blanked me. This was the doctor we had seen before. She stared at the wall, rolling her eyes.\" </p> <p>Hannah returned to sit with Holly. </p> <p>A few minutes later, another doctor examined Holly, and said she was happy for her to go home. \"I said, 'What about the temperature?' and she said, 'I can give you some Nurofen which is a bit stronger for children, but I'm pretty sure it's a virus that she's sleeping off.'\" </p> <p>Hannah told the doctor that Holly had been asleep since Monday lunchtime - it was now 1.30am on Tuesday night. \"The doctor asked me if she is usually asleep at this time of night. I said, 'Well yes, usually,' and she said, 'I'd still expect her to be asleep at this time, so you know, don't worry.'\" The doctor wrote a prescription for Nurofen and left it on a chair. Another half hour passed before a nurse found it for them. </p> <p>\"The ironic thing is that we couldn't wait to get out of there,\" Mike says. \"You get there, think something's going to happen, and when it doesn't you're just glad to get out.\" What astonished Mike throughout was the way the doctors refused to listen to what they had to say about Holly. \"As parents, you know when something isn't quite right - that's why we'd seen four doctors in two days - and that should be taken into account. But it wasn't in our case.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday morning Holly didn't wake up. Hannah brought her down to lie on the sofa, and tried her with a different bottle but she would not take anything. </p> <p>Hannah's cigarette is shaking in her hand as she tells the story. She is constantly on the verge of tears. She has played back every event so many times, as if this time things might work out differently. \"I went to the bloody gym in the afternoon.\" </p> <p>\"But she was with me,\" Mike says, gently. </p> <p>\"I know, but I don't know why I went. I had an appointment for the induction and didn't want to go, but I just wanted to get out of the house. And when I came back you still hadn't managed to give her anything to drink, and I rang up the doctor, and asked if he could come round to the house.\" </p> <p>But he was too busy, and told her that the walk to the surgery might wake Holly up. </p> <p>Hannah asked if it could be anything insidious and, like the other doctors, this one said no. He was sure that Holly was sleeping off a virus, but he referred her back to King's anyway - again, just in case. King's wouldn't take her because they were too busy. Eventually St Thomas's agreed to see her. </p> <p>\"Thankfully, they took her in straight away, and put a sticker on her saying 'unwell baby',\" Hannah says. They put her on a drip, took blood tests, and said Holly would have to stay the night while they did a lumbar puncture. They finally took some urine by inserting a needle into her bladder. </p> <p>\"They said to get some sleep, but obviously I couldn't. I was just watching her. She looked bloody awful. Then her face just went all blotchy and she was having difficulty breathing. I ran to get the doctor.\" </p> <p>Doctors, nurses and porters all came running. It was decided that Holly should be taken to the intensive care department at Guy's hospital because the equipment was better. But even there, there were delays. The CT scanner wasn't working and the theatre at St Thomas's had been locked for the night. </p> <p> Hannah and her mother were left in a corridor outside the surgery. She was told they would have to wait for 10-15 minutes. The doctor returned three hours later. \"He was walking very slowly, hands in his pockets, looking at the floor. He had another female doctor with him and a nurse. I just knew he wasn't going to tell me what I wanted to hear.\" </p> <p>The doctor told her that Holly had meningitis. \"He said, were there any questions. Of course, I couldn't think of anything. But mum said, 'Is she going to be all right?' He just said, 'There's a possibility she'll recover.' We sat there not looking at each other.\" </p> <p>That Thursday morning, Holly was transferred to Guy's where Hannah says Holly was looked after \"brilliantly\". The staff explained what the side effects could be, but added that they were rare. \"I thought she would go back to being like a baby, take a long time to recover but I assumed she'd be OK. But very soon after she woke up we knew she couldn't hear anything. 'Unlucky' was the word they used.\" </p> <p>Both Hannah and Mike are musicians. Hannah's mother, Lesley, says this makes it even more difficult for them to cope with Holly's deafness. Holly used to love it when Mike played simple tunes for her on his saxophone. </p> <p>The word \"meningitis\" had crossed Hannah's mind - after all, it is every parent's worst fear - but of course she had put her faith in the medical profession. \"I feel terrible, that I didn't actually use that specific word right from the beginning, just stand up and shout.\" </p> <p>But how could she have done any more? She went to the doctor several times. Meningitis is often hard to detect in babies, but Hannah felt that the doctor should have been able to diagnose it on examining Holly. \"If I had just made more fuss... but I'm not that kind of person. You just think, if I had made more fuss, they might have caught it earlier... it might have made a difference.\" </p> <p>The doctors say that the only hope for Holly's hearing is a cochlear implant, but it is too early to say whether that will work. Holly is also expected to have learning difficulties due to brain damage. </p> <p>Hannah kisses her elder daughter, Martha, goodbye as she heads off for nursery with a big smile. \"The worst thing is knowing that Holly is not going to grow up like Martha.\" She talks about the way they used to sing and dance together. </p> <p>The doctors at Guy's hospital told Hannah and Mike how advanced Holly was for her age. She already had a vocabulary of half a dozen words. These have disappeared. She is already retreating into a world of silence. \"The way she is getting quieter and quieter is terrifying,\" says Hannah. </p> <p>Yesterday the King's College Hospital NHS Trust said that it would like to apologise \"for the distress felt by the parents of Holly Loach\" - but the hospital did not think that it was unreasonable that she had been sent home before being diagnosed as having meningitis. \"Following concerns raised by Holly's parents, the trust has reviewed Holly's care and concluded that the clinical decision was appropriate for the symptoms that she was showing at the time. A diagnosis of meningitis was considered within that clinical decision.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The National Meningitis Trust has a 24-hour helpline: 0800 6000 800.</p>",

What with going to bed for the night during the commercial break in Countdown, there is no time to study any more than the index of Dr Jarvis's book, but I will try to get down to it tomorrow. </p> <p><strong> Thursday</strong> </p> <p> After a supper that I imagine must have been part of my wife's ongoing market research for the prototype ITV game show Name That Meat, I complain about some of the sloppy omissions - prostate problems, for example, and no mention of pattern baldness under \"hair loss\" - in Dr Jarvis's book. \"Did the topic on page 158 not suggest anything?\" asks Rebecca. \"I haven't got that far yet. Let me see.\" She throws the book across the sitting room at a speed and trajectory that would have frightened Oddjob, and once feeling has returned to my left arm, I turn to page 158. \"Vulval irritation and/or sores\" is the topic. \"This wouldn't be a book written for women, would it?\" I ask. Rebecca makes a sub-Homer Simpson grunt, and leaves the room. </p> <p><strong> Friday </strong> </p> <p> I am exhausted and rather tetchy having had a troubled night. With the jet lag seemingly in retreat at last, I was up until 4am reading A Younger Woman's Diagnose it Yourself Guide to Health, and excellent it is with diagrams on the left-hand side of the page narrowing down possible illnesses, and written advice on the right. Most material is common to both sexes, but frankly some seems ambiguous. If I didn't know better, I'd swear from the symptoms that I was going through an early menopause. </p> <p> <strong> Saturday </strong> </p> <p> The book has vanished.

In this, the Bermuda Triangle of medical publishing, I make that the 23rd book, text book or dictionary to go in three years.

Gradually it dawns on me what it is: I am feeling refreshed, free of pain and full of energy. Well, in fact. I take the dog for a walk in a starkly sunny, crisp, high clouded, autumnal morning, and as we amble round Ravenscourt Park I realise something else: for whatever reason or combination of reasons - a long run without a serious medical scare, reading in Dr Jarvis's book about so many nasty things I cannot get, a story in the Observer about a new early detection cancer test - the terror of death which has plagued me remorselessly since I turned 19 seems as distant today as I can remember. </p> <p> <strong>Monday </strong></p> <p> An old friend rings to tell me something. Last night she dreamed I had died. \"Yes, but I did cry,\" she says consolingly, and is gone. Unthinkingly, I turn for refuge to the whisky bottle and am beginning to feel less distressed when Rebecca returns from work. I tell her about the dream. \"Well, even you aren't going to believe that, are you? It's not as if she's psychic, is it? What possible reason could you have to be worried by her dream?\" I stare at Rebecca very hard. \"What's her name?\" I ask, icily. \"Sorry?\" \"It isn't a trick question from quantum mechanics. What is the name of the friend whose insight into the future you advise me not to believe.\" \"Cassandra. It's Cassandra,\" replies Rebecca. \"Oh my God, it's Cassandra.\" Taking the bottle of Glenlivet in one hand and Dr Jarvis's book in the other, I head dolefully up the stairs to bed.</p>",

I tell her about the dream. \"Well, even you aren't going to believe that, are you? It's not as if she's psychic, is it? What possible reason could you have to be worried by her dream?\" I stare at Rebecca very hard. \"What's her name?\" I ask, icily. \"Sorry?\" \"It isn't a trick question from quantum mechanics. What is the name of the friend whose insight into the future you advise me not to believe.\" \"Cassandra. It's Cassandra,\" replies Rebecca. \"Oh my God, it's Cassandra.\" Taking the bottle of Glenlivet in one hand and Dr Jarvis's book in the other, I head dolefully up the stairs to bed.",

      "bodyText": "High street stationery retailer Ryman has found its perfect online match - a long-term deal with Bertelsmann's shopping service Bol.com. The partnership is part of Bol's initiative to hook into high street commerce, a move it initiated at the end of September when it tied up with book wholesalers Bertrams to take Britain's 3,000-plus independent book shops online. The Ryman's deal will enable Bol to market itself in all the stationery retailer's 90 high street stores. Plans under consideration include window posters and Bol shelf branding, in addition to a Bol ad being given the whole back page of Ryman's Christmas catalogue, of which 750,000 copies have been printed. A co-branded website has been created, linking from bol.com, as part of the deal. Commission of around 7% is to be paid for any sales that are generated by referrals from either partner's site. It is thought the deal may lead to Bol helping Ryman's to upgrade its clunky website, although nothing has been decided at this stage. Malcolm Cooke, group marketing director at Ryman said: \"Ryman has been growing at over 10% like for like over the past few years and this link with Bol should help continue to keep us well ahead of our competition.\"",

      "body": "<p>The polling stations have opened on the east coast of the US for today's presidential election that is still too close to call after the tightest race in 40 years.</p> <p>Exhausted by the effort, the candidates, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W Bush, have now surrendered their fate to the voters.</p> <p>Mr Bush, the governor of Texas and son of former president George Bush, is topping most of the polls, but the outcome is uncertain.</p> <p>Mr Gore, who has been the US vice-president for eight years, put in a final push of campaigning in Florida, a key state to win.</p> <p>The earliest results are already in from the two New Hampshire towns where votes are traditionally first posted.</p> <p>In Dixville Notch, the result was Bush, 21, Gore 5, and the green candidate, Ralph Nader, 1. In nearby Hart's Location, it was Bush 17 and Gore 13, with one vote for a write-in candidate.</p> <p>\"It's not close here, but I believe it will be close in New Hampshire and across the country,\" said Stephen Barba, a Dixville Notch voter.</p> <p>Mr Bush will cast his ballot in Austin, Texas, and has been making calls to west coast radio stations to urge voters to turn out.

      "bodyText": "The polling stations have opened on the east coast of the US for today's presidential election that is still too close to call after the tightest race in 40 years. Exhausted by the effort, the candidates, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W Bush, have now surrendered their fate to the voters. Mr Bush, the governor of Texas and son of former president George Bush, is topping most of the polls, but the outcome is uncertain. Mr Gore, who has been the US vice-president for eight years, put in a final push of campaigning in Florida, a key state to win. The earliest results are already in from the two New Hampshire towns where votes are traditionally first posted. In Dixville Notch, the result was Bush, 21, Gore 5, and the green candidate, Ralph Nader, 1. In nearby Hart's Location, it was Bush 17 and Gore 13, with one vote for a write-in candidate. \"It's not close here, but I believe it will be close in New Hampshire and across the country,\" said Stephen Barba, a Dixville Notch voter. Mr Bush will cast his ballot in Austin, Texas, and has been making calls to west coast radio stations to urge voters to turn out. He also was calling voters in Michigan, Oregon, Florida, Iowa and Wisconsin. After his pre-dawn campaigning in Florida, Mr Gore was voting in Carthage, Tennessee. Voters were choosing between Mr Bush's promise to be a \"uniter not a divider\" and Mr Gore's assertion that he alone has the experience to \"fight for you and win.\" A new Congress was also being decided at the polls. Before that election day ritual in New Hampshire, the candidates had barnstormed the country one last time. Mr Bush hit four states - Tennessee, Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas - that voted for Bill Clinton and Mr Gore in 1992 and 1996, but which polls suggest could go Republican. \"If people do what I think they're going to do, you're looking at the next president of the United States,\" the Texas governor told an audience of several hundred supporters after returning to Austin. For his part, Mr Gore engaged in a marathon 30-hour campaigning flurry through crucial Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida. In Florida, he said that the crowd of tens of thousands who greeted him in Miami's fashionable South Beach left him with \"no doubt whatsoever\" he'd finish the day as president-elect. \"Americans are coming together and making a very powerful decision that we are not going to allow ourselves to go back to the policies of the past,\" Mr Gore told the crowd. \"We're going forward with the policies of the future - a bright future that includes all Americans.\" A cast of stars - Glenn Close, Robert De Niro, Stevie Wonder, Billy Dee Williams, Ben Affleck - were there to boost his final campaigning. From Miami, Mr Gore headed to a decidedly more sombre event, holding a pre-dawn meeting with nurses at a Tampa cancer centre, where he sat around a table and talked health care. Mr Gore also was rallying workers on their way to \"get out the vote\" before heading home to cast his own vote at a small school in Carthage. Behind Mr Gore and Mr Bush was the most expensive election in history - $3bn (\u00a32bn) on presidential and congressional races, about $30 for every vote cast - but one that failed to stir much excitement. President Bill Clinton predicted that Mr Gore will emerge victorious on the strength of the economy and a hoped-for large turnout among black people, Latin Americans, immigrants and the working poor. \"He's run a good campaign on his own,\" Mr Clinton said, before taking off from Washington bound for his new home in Chappaqua, New York, where he planned to vote. \"Especially the last couple of weeks, I think he's really been in gear and you also see a lot of our people getting energised. I think he'll win.\" In addition to replacing Mr Clinton, the people were deciding control of the house of representatives and senate, both narrowly held by Republicans. Voters were picking all 435 members of the House, 34 senators and 11 governors and members of state legislatures. For the first time in history, a president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, is seeking election to the Senate. She faced Republican Rick Lazio in New York, nominated when prostate cancer caused the mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, to abandon plans to run. With peace and prosperity both at hand and not big issues, the fight was chiefly over how to divide the spoils of prosperity. Mr Bush proposes tax cuts and Mr Gore favours shoring up federal pensions, health care and education.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The old argument about whether writing can be taught or not is \"nonsense\", according to Graham Joyce, a 46-year-old senior lecturer in creative writing at Nottingham Trent University who has just won the British Fantasy Award for Best Novel for an extraordinary fourth time. </p> <p>\"It's the only art form where anybody would raise that question. With any other art form - ballet, music - of course there has to be teaching. It's the same with writing.\" </p> <p>He prefers a spare prose style. In the mining village of Keresley near Coventry, where he grew up, anybody using words of more than two syllables was instantly suspected of being a homosexual. \"Generally fantasy writers write long. I write short.\" </p> <p>He adds: \"You cannot teach inspiration or grace, but lots of craft elements can be taught. Dialogue, for instance, is something people find tricky, but there are all sorts of tips on how to make it work. It's all about editing down. Narrative structure, character development and sense of place can all be taught.\" </p> <p>From a mining family - his dad, grandfather and brothers went down the pit - Joyce was brought up in a house with scarcely any books. After failing the 11-plus, he went to a comprehensive in Bedworth, Warwickshire. \"Education was a closed box to my parents,\" he says. \"But they could see it was a way out of mining. They knew that intuitively.\" </p> <p>There was, however, an oral storytelling tradition in his family - his dad loved recounting anecdotes and several relatives on his mother's side used to tell a good tale. \"You have to be able to imagine a scene,\" he said. \"This addresses the hoary old question of the difference between telling and showing in a story. A lot of people can write stuff, but for some reason they cannot impress in their mind's eye the thing happening live and therefore cannot render a scene.\" </p> <p>As well as talent, would-be writers also need doggedness to finish, for example, an 80,000-word novel. \"I have seen loads of students with a natural flair for words,\" he said. \"but they just do not have the persistence.\" Joyce is a great believer in writers spending time serving their craft before becoming fluent at pushing the words around on a page. </p> <p>\"What I do at the university enriches my writing because I am constantly having to break down the craft elements to communicate clearly.

      "bodyText": "The old argument about whether writing can be taught or not is \"nonsense\", according to Graham Joyce, a 46-year-old senior lecturer in creative writing at Nottingham Trent University who has just won the British Fantasy Award for Best Novel for an extraordinary fourth time. \"It's the only art form where anybody would raise that question. With any other art form - ballet, music - of course there has to be teaching. It's the same with writing.\" He prefers a spare prose style. In the mining village of Keresley near Coventry, where he grew up, anybody using words of more than two syllables was instantly suspected of being a homosexual. \"Generally fantasy writers write long. I write short.\" He adds: \"You cannot teach inspiration or grace, but lots of craft elements can be taught. Dialogue, for instance, is something people find tricky, but there are all sorts of tips on how to make it work. It's all about editing down. Narrative structure, character development and sense of place can all be taught.\" From a mining family - his dad, grandfather and brothers went down the pit - Joyce was brought up in a house with scarcely any books. After failing the 11-plus, he went to a comprehensive in Bedworth, Warwickshire. \"Education was a closed box to my parents,\" he says. \"But they could see it was a way out of mining. They knew that intuitively.\" There was, however, an oral storytelling tradition in his family - his dad loved recounting anecdotes and several relatives on his mother's side used to tell a good tale. \"You have to be able to imagine a scene,\" he said. \"This addresses the hoary old question of the difference between telling and showing in a story. A lot of people can write stuff, but for some reason they cannot impress in their mind's eye the thing happening live and therefore cannot render a scene.\" As well as talent, would-be writers also need doggedness to finish, for example, an 80,000-word novel. \"I have seen loads of students with a natural flair for words,\" he said. \"but they just do not have the persistence.\" Joyce is a great believer in writers spending time serving their craft before becoming fluent at pushing the words around on a page. \"What I do at the university enriches my writing because I am constantly having to break down the craft elements to communicate clearly. It's kind of exporting the knowledge from the intuitive to the rational mode. If you are claiming to be a craftsperson, you should be able to replicate these effects time and time again. \"Intellectually that is quite challenging because then you can start looking at other great writers and see how they do it.

Neil Warnock, currently at Sheffield United, ex-Huddersfield boss Steve Bruce, Joe Kinnear, Howard Kendall, Roy Evans and David Pleat are all in the running. The Sun adds Steve Coppell to the list of potential managers but suggests Evans and Kendall are front-runners for the post. The Daily Mail touts Pleat as favourite. The \u00a36 million price-tag that Claudio Ranieri has placed on out-of-favour Jody Morris at Stamford Bridge is too high for Leicester City, although Peter Taylor is interested, the Daily Star reports. Manchester United are ready to sign Canadian defender Kevin McKenna from German club Energie Cottbus according to the Daily Star. However, according to planetfootball, West Ham are more likely to capture McKenna's signature. Planetfootball claim Arsenal are pursuing Kennedy Bakircioglu, who once had a trial at Manchester United and is currently at Hammarby in Sweden. Barcelona and Gothenborg are also interested in the 20-year-old. Bolton's South African international Mark Fish will sign for Charlton today for \u00a3700,000, according to The Sun. Jim Smith is ready to let Lars Bohinen leave Premiership strugglers Derby while Coventry look to add to their Moroccan contingent by targeting Youssef Safri.",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore was closing the gap on George W Bush as Americans prepared to go to the polls today to elect a successor to Bill Clinton in one of the closest-fought presidential election campaigns in US history. The final daily tracking polls of the campaign showed Mr Gore, the Democrat, narrowing the long-standing lead of his Republican rival to well within the statistical margin of error. One poll even gave Mr Gore a 2% lead on the back of a strong 48 hours of polling. In the final Gallup tracking survey of the campaign, Mr Bush led by 47% to Mr Gore's 45%, compared with a 48%-43% lead at the weekend. In the final Zogby International tracking poll, Mr Bush led by just one point, 47% to 46%. A late tracking poll by Reuters/MSNBC put Mr Gore in the lead at 48% to 46%. Further evidence of a neck- and-neck finish came last night in a Harris poll based on an unusually large sample, which showed Mr Bush leading 47%-46% in the popular vote, but projected Mr Gore as the next president by virtue of a 286-241 victory in the electoral college, with Washington state's 11 votes too close to call. The Harris poll was based on a sample of 134,000 people and was carried out between October 30 and November 4. It also supported the opinion of some experts that Mr Gore might become the first man since 1888 to be elected president without winning a majority of the popular vote. Oozing confidence, Mr Bush took his campaign deep into opposition territory on the last full day on the stump, campaigning in Mr Clinton's Arkansas and Mr Gore's Tennessee before returning to his home in Austin, Texas. \"We've laid the groundwork for victory. Now it's up to us to get people to the polls,\" Mr Bush told supporters in Orlando, Florida yesterday. Mr Gore campaigned in the key states of Iowa, Missouri, Michigan and Florida, all of which he needs to win if he is to fulfil his dream of succeeding Mr Clinton. \"You are the ones who are going to make the difference in this race,\" Mr Gore told Iowa campaign workers in a pre-dawn briefing. \"That's what's going to win this race.\" A new Gallup poll of independent voters showed a sharp swing from Mr Nader to Mr Gore.

As well as a president, a new House of Representatives was being elected today by American voters, along with 34 members of the US Senate.

The latest research from media monitoring company ACNielsen MMS shows that the growth in UK ad spend dropped to 4% in the year to September 2000, down from 7% in the previous year. And the growth in advertising spend was mainly driven by the dot.com and IT sectors, prompting fears that the advertising market could fall if, as experts predict, struggling dot.coms begin to cut their marketing budgets. In the last year advertising revenues have been dramatically boosted by the flood of internet companies launching high-profile TV and billboard campaigns. The growth in dot.com ad spend is now falling as more and more internet companies go to the wall. Several industries that have traditionally been big advertisers have actually cut their advertising spend over the last year.

Surgeons and medical teams worked for 20 hours to separate the twins at St Mary's hospital in Manchester where they were born three months ago. The operation ended early today and Jodie was said to be in a \"critical but stable condition\". \"Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of the medical team, Mary sadly died,\" a hospital spokesman said. \"As with all major surgery, the first few days following an operation are the most critical and our thoughts remain with Jodie and her parents.\" Their parents, who opposed the operation for religious reasons, said their goodbyes to Mary before the operation started yesterday morning. Mary, who had primitive brain functions, was said to have been \"draining the life\" out of Jodie, who is thought to have normal mental abilities. Jodie's heart and lungs had kept them both alive. Jodie will now need extensive skin grafts and surgery but doctors say she could be of normal intelligence, able to walk, have children and have an average life expectancy. The legal battle to save her began shortly after the twins were born with fused spines, joined at the abdomen and with arms and legs at right angles to their upper bodies. Doctors from St Mary's went to the high court in August and won the right to operate despite the objection of the parents, who are strict Roman Catholics from the Maltese island of Gozo. They challenged the decision in a privately funded appeal the following month, but lost after agonising deliberations by the three judges involved who decided Mary must die to save the life of her stronger sister. An 11th hour appeal was lodged by the ProLife Alliance last Friday but it also failed to halt the surgery.

      "body": "<p>George W Bush is a political blue-blood. Like his Democratic rival Al Gore, his father was a successful politician - and, also like Al Gore, he shares his father's name.</p> <p>But even more than Gore, Bush's candidature suggests that the US is not quite the land of open-for-all opportunity people think it is.</p> <p>If George Bush is elected to the White House, it will have as much to do with his father's reputation and fund-raising powers as it will with Bush's own character.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he is typical of his generation and his country. A Spanish-speaking millionaire who has moved with the nation from his east coast roots to the booming south-west - in his case, Texas - he grew up more involved in baseball than in anything else.</p> <p>He studied at Yale, where he was noted more for his personality than for his academic skills. After a spell in the Texas National Guard (which earned him exemption from serving in Vietnam) he spent the early 1970s apparently lost. He partied, drank and - though the details are unclear - took drugs. In 1976, he was convicted of drink driving.</p> <p>After a failed bid for a seat in Congress, Bush made - and lost - money in the oil business as his father became first vice-president and then president. He married and his wife, Laura, helped him put his unsettled past behind him.</p> <p>In 1994, after his father's defeat by Bill Clinton, he beat the Democratic governor of Texas, Ann Richards, in a tough fight. Bush took notably conservative positions - on homosexuality, the death penalty and youth crime.</p> <p>In office, he stuck to them - although he worked with Democrats on his only real political passion, education. By keeping his election promises, Bush was re-elected in 1998 with 68% of the vote.</p> <p>That success made him a natural front-runner for the Republican nomination.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush is a political blue-blood. Like his Democratic rival Al Gore, his father was a successful politician - and, also like Al Gore, he shares his father's name. But even more than Gore, Bush's candidature suggests that the US is not quite the land of open-for-all opportunity people think it is. If George Bush is elected to the White House, it will have as much to do with his father's reputation and fund-raising powers as it will with Bush's own character. Nonetheless, he is typical of his generation and his country. A Spanish-speaking millionaire who has moved with the nation from his east coast roots to the booming south-west - in his case, Texas - he grew up more involved in baseball than in anything else. He studied at Yale, where he was noted more for his personality than for his academic skills. After a spell in the Texas National Guard (which earned him exemption from serving in Vietnam) he spent the early 1970s apparently lost. He partied, drank and - though the details are unclear - took drugs. In 1976, he was convicted of drink driving. After a failed bid for a seat in Congress, Bush made - and lost - money in the oil business as his father became first vice-president and then president. He married and his wife, Laura, helped him put his unsettled past behind him. In 1994, after his father's defeat by Bill Clinton, he beat the Democratic governor of Texas, Ann Richards, in a tough fight. Bush took notably conservative positions - on homosexuality, the death penalty and youth crime. In office, he stuck to them - although he worked with Democrats on his only real political passion, education. By keeping his election promises, Bush was re-elected in 1998 with 68% of the vote. That success made him a natural front-runner for the Republican nomination. He won it by portraying himself as a \"compassionate conservative\" - able to work across party lines and take tough decisions on social issues. Critics pointed to his record on the death penalty (150 people have been executed in Texas during his time as governor, one a fortnight) and on pollution. No issue caused more controversy than his decision to allow the execution of Karla Faye Tucker. Convicted of a double-murder, she appealed for clemency on national television. After what he described as one of the hardest decisions he had ever had to take, Bush allowed her to die. Early this year, he beat a strong challenge from the reformist Republican John McCain in the primary vote to decide the Republican candidate, and built a lead over Al Gore which, though wavering, has endured to the eve of polling day. Critics have pointed to his lightweight past, and his verbal slips. Even supporters admit that he is not a man for detail, but say he is a good delegator. That is one strength. His amiability and apparent self-confidence are others. American voters connect with him in a way they do not with Al Gore, and that may be enough to see him to victory on polling day.

      "body": "<p>Playing the lead in a comedy is not where you'd expect to find <a href=\"/Film/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,45424,00.html\">Linus Roache</a>. Acclaimed for his riveting performance as the tortured Father Greg in 1994's Priest, and as the flawed journalist-gigolo in Iain Softley's adaptation of The Wings of the Dove, the 36-year-old actor is associated more with the intense and brooding shades of the acting spectrum than the lighter, comic ones.</p> <p>Yet, he tells me one wet afternoon in a dark Leicester Square bar, what attracted him to the lead role in Siam Sunset was its humour. \"I really wanted to do a comedy, but a lot of the comedies I'd seen or read were formulaic. Siam Sunset felt so off-the-wall and different and fresh and new, and had so many different qualities to it. It also had real drama, and an element of magic and mystery.\"</p> <p>Siam Sunset is indeed far from formulaic. Part road movie, part romance, part thriller, part farce: it's a truly black comedy that explores what happens to a man after his wife dies in a bizarre accident - the kind of bizarre accident that you think is only an urban myth. </p> <p>Perry (Roache), an industrial chemist who creates colours, believes that someone has \"got it in\" for him. After a lorry crashes through his living room, he decides to get away from it all, and heads for Australia on a touring holiday won at a bingo game. But his troubles are far from over. He finds himself on an antiquated coach with a variety of misfits led by driver Bill. Also along for the ride is Grace (Danielle Cormack), on the run from her drug-dealing boyfriend. The Siam Sunset of the title is 'the colour of peace' that Perry hopes to create. Phew. </p> <p>\"I hadn't done a film that actually gives people joy and fun. It's great to be in cinemas and watch people respond,\" explains Roache. \"...it was great fun and it surprised me as well what happens at the beginning still makes me laugh now.\" He adds that he's been instructed not to reveal quite how his unfortunate 'wife' meets her end. </p> <p>Passing unnoticed in the throng of Leicester Square, Roache is a slight figure, who is casually dressed and friendly and relaxed. He looks far too good for someone who's getting over jetlag and a non-stop seven month run of stage performances. He's just returned from Tokyo where he has been touring in productions of Richard II and Coriolanus, acting opposite Ralph Fiennes. He's in town today for the London Film Festival screening of Pandaemonium, in which he plays the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. </p> <p>However, Siam Sunset is uppermost on his mind. Made over two years ago, and premiered at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, Siam Sunset was Australian actor John Polson's directorial debut, but it has been sitting on the distributor's shelf for some time now. Roache acknowledges that it's a difficult film to sell: \"It's a challenge because it's not clearly this kind of movie or that kind of movie, it's a road movie, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce, it's all these things. Maybe it's very ambitious in that way, it does make it hard to find your audience, but I think there's something in there for everybody.\"</p> <p>I ask him about the filming. With the final third of the movie set in the desolate desert of the Australian outback amid extreme heat, it must have been a gruelling shoot. </p> <p>Not really, he tells me. He remembers the experience fondly. \"We were having a great time. We were a bunch of actors who really got on well with a director who's the kind of guy who makes you want to work for him, with a real sense of fun. It's an old metaphor, but it's a true one and it works: this guy ends up in the middle of nowhere with nothing, and there he finds peace. I liked that, and it's kind of true - you're in the desert and there's just the ground and the sky.\" </p> <p>With roles extending from an accident-prone industrial chemist to one of England's greatest romantic poets, and then on to Shakespeare on stage, Roache - unlike his famous father Bill (who, as Coronation Street's Ken Barlow, is the world's longest-serving soap opera actor) - seems determined not to be defined by any one period or role. How does he choose his projects? \"Sometimes out of reaction to what you've just done. If you've just done Wings of the Dove, you don't want to go near the next Merchant-Ivory, but quite often you do get asked to do the same sort of thing immediately again. So I did Shot through the Heart [in which he played a Croatian soldier] after Wings of the Dove, which couldn't be more different. And then Siam Sunset came along.</p> <p>\"I don't have a game plan, a strategy. You just smell your way around. I'm not in a position to just have the pick of the crop, but I am lucky enough to be able to take my time and choose a good job ...something I connect with. Basically I look for a good story.\" </p> <p>Three years ago, critics were salivating over his performance in the Henry James adaptation Wings of the Dove, and Hollywood was calling. His breakthrough role in Antonia Bird's Priest in 1994 also led to acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic. So why has he not headed west? Does he envy the international success of his long-time acting associate Ralph Fiennes? \"A few years ago I would have said yes,\" he confesses, but he's not so sure now. \"Ralph is extraordinary. I really admire him - we've just spent seven months working together. But as well as carrying it all off, he's got all the responsibilities of a leading star - the publicist, the PA, the lawyers, he's got the whole machine and I don't want all that. I want to make films, I want to do bits of theatre, and do the things that I want to do... It's a lot to handle. I just want to enjoy my freedom and be able to be creative and do more movies. I'd like more choice - I'd like more power in that way, but I don't want to have to deal with all that.\"</p> <p>But, he does admit that he would love to work in America, should the right thing came along, whatever that may be. \"It's not necessarily an art film,\" he says. \"I love a lot of mainstream movies. I love The Matrix - a genius, brilliant film. I'd love to be part of something big like that. I'd love to work with an American crew and experience a real Hollywood blockbuster. Not having to worry about using up too much film stock and doing too many takes.\"</p> <p>Which was a problem he had to contend with on the Julien Temple project. \"Pandaemonium was pandemonium,\" he laughs. Filming began straight after Siam Sunset, and \"it was great to go and do something with such a different energy... [Coleridge] is such an extrovert, outwards character, and a lot of the characters I play are introspected, so that was a great shift.\"</p> <p>I wonder whether Temple had a personal vendetta against Wordsworth, who is portrayed as a mean-spirited pedant who'd be more fitted to writing parking tickets than soaringly beautiful poetry. \"Yes, Coleridge comes out very well,\" agrees Roache. \"I think that was Julien's aim - to redress things. He feels that Wordsworth has been given all this respect for not much, and that, really, Coleridge was the genius.\" I suspect that Wordsworth fans will be up in arms, while Roache's involving performance as the opium-addicted Coleridge will do wonders towards rejuvenating his appeal, even if Temple's story bears little relation to reality. </p> <p>Having worked across film, theatre and TV, is Roache one of those actors who claim they only really feel 'alive' on stage? Not so, apparently. \"I prefer film, definitely. I like the concentration, the whole atmosphere round the film set, that you're constantly in a state of rehearsal.\" He compares it to theatre where \"every night you have to go the whole nine yards and deliver. But in film, you've got your big scene, and you know it's coming up, and you work towards it, and you work it on that day, and then it's done. There's a certain freedom in that.\"</p> <p>But don't most actors claim the opposite, complaining of a lack of freedom and control on the film set? \"Yes, it can be frustrating, and I understand completely why actors end up directing and producing, because you are at the mercy of the editor and the director. But I don't have a burning desire to have that kind of power, and I'm quite happy to put myself in the hands of other people. I've been lucky - I've been in good hands, and most of the time I've been enhanced, not reduced by their work.\"</p> <p>Roache's disinterest in the 'glamorous' side of the film industry is well documented. After the release of Priest, he ducked out of the limelight to take an 18-month trip through India. When asked how he feels about the flipside of his fame, he counters with, \"What do you mean by glamour? What is glamorous about it? If there's glamour there I haven't seen it. Sure, sometimes you get treated very well and stay in nice places, but that's not really glamour.\" </p> <p>But surely he feels something about the fact that his chiselled good looks are used to sell movies? \"Is it inevitable to be a pin-up?\" he muses. \"How can you say no to that side of it? It's just the way it is. It's neither good nor bad. I don't court it. I just do that job.\" He tells me of his recent trip to Tokyo. \"[Ralph and I] turned into pop stars. But it's not real. It's some worship thing that's projected onto you. It takes a lot to stay sane in the middle of it all... I'm not going to push it all away, but at the same time I'm not going to start feeding on it or adding to it. It just is what it is.\"</p> <p>Roache credits much of his sanity to the spiritual organisation known as FACE (Friends of Andrew Cohen Everywhere) with which he became involved on his Indian pilgrimage. The group teaches spiritual enlightenment and independence through self-enquiry, and Roache is more than happy to talk about it: \"Andrew Cohen is a big part of my life - the foundation of my life.\" </p> <p>Does he worry about seeing himself and his beliefs ridiculed, as has happened in the past, with the organisation demonised as a cult, and Cohen vilified as a dangerous megalomaniac? \"Well, people can read the magazine (What is Enlightenment) and find out for themselves,\" he says. \"There's a lot of cynicism in the world today, but I can't let that stop me. What's wrong with investigating the nature of reality and truth in an unbiased and unprejudiced way?\" </p> <p>As far as his acting's concerned, Roache reckons his beliefs have made him \"more relaxed, much less needy.\" Not that he's pretending it's solved all his problems: \"I'm not totally free from all paranoias of acting, but I have a much saner relation with it. </p> <p>\"It's like a wheel - you can go on forever. I'd done film, I'd done TV, I'd done the West End, I'd done the RSC, and it's like: well, ok, what's next? A BIG movie. What's next? Another B-I-I-I-I-G movie. An Oscar! Ten! I thought, 'I don't want that'. So I took the time out to travel and look at things from a different perspective. A lot of people thought I was insane. But you follow your instincts.\"</p> <p>Roache strikes me as someone who is incapable of doing anything but follow his instincts. Thinking back to Siam Sunset, he laughs as he remembers that despite his intention to do comedy, he found himself again playing the tragic figure.</p> <p>\"I was so excited to be in a comedy that I started goofing around. The first few days I was throwing a few comic looks and so on, and looking at the rushes, John said, 'I want you to be the tragic figure, the straight man, walking through all this. Let everybody else do the comedy, and let the situation be funny.' And that was quite a renunciation for me because I was wanting to be a little bit goofy as well.\"</p> <p>I like the idea of him being a little bit goofy. Maybe the opportunity will present itself. But whatever happens, I feel sure that as long as Linus Roache the man follows those instincts, Linus Roache the actor will continue to be taken seriously.</p> <p>\u0095 Tickets for Thursday's charity premiere of Siam Sunset are available on 020-7419 8109. Siam Sunset is released on November 10. Pandaemonium will be released early next year.</p>",

And that was quite a renunciation for me because I was wanting to be a little bit goofy as well.\" I like the idea of him being a little bit goofy. Maybe the opportunity will present itself. But whatever happens, I feel sure that as long as Linus Roache the man follows those instincts, Linus Roache the actor will continue to be taken seriously. \u0095 Tickets for Thursday's charity premiere of Siam Sunset are available on 020-7419 8109.

Most states allow voters to register to vote until 10 days or so before polling day and in recent years, the process has been simplified. Americans can apply to register online and even when they renew driving licences. <p><b>How does polling day work? </b><br> Again, the rules vary from state to state: but almost everywhere, voting is a different experience from the same process in Britain. For a start, only 1.7% of voters use British-style ballot papers. Traditionally, Americans vote using mechanical levers (a bit like adding up on an old-style cash register). About a fifth of US votes are still cast this way, but computer technology is taking over. Whichever system is used, the votes are counted quickly. Since polling stations close early in the evening, the result is often declared surprisingly early. Adding to the complexity, though, are America's multiple time zones. Exit polls from some eastern states are available before voters have finished choosing candidates in the west. This can have a big impact on the result. </p> <p><b>What happens once the polls have closed? </b><br> The votes are counted and results declared state by state. Most international attention will be on the presidential race, but Americans will also vote on a huge range of other jobs, including some state governors, senators, members of the House of Representatives and local officials such as police chiefs. In some states voters also take part in referenda on contentious local issues. </p> <p><b>But how does the presidential vote work?</b><br> American presidents are not elected directly but through an electoral college. In 48 of the 50 states, the candidate who finishes top collects all of that state's votes in the \"electoral college\" (in the two oddballs, Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who comes second is given one of the college votes as well).</p> <p><b>How is the electoral college organised? </b><br> The college has 538 seats. A candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. Roughly, college votes are allocated to states by population. As the largest state, California has 54 votes in the electoral college. New York is second with 33. Seven sparsely populated states, plus the District of Columbia, have three votes each, the minimum allowed. </p> <p><b>Which states will decide the election? </b><br> Mr Gore's hopes now rest absolutely on a victory in Florida, a state with 25 electoral college votes. At one time it seemed likely to go to Mr Bush, but as things have turned out, Mr Gore has been in the lead there in most opinion polls this autumn. </p> <p>The other fiercely fought state is Pennsylvania (23 votes), where the polls now put Mr Gore ahead. He also needs to win in Michigan (18 votes), where the race has been neck-and-neck and the survey results contradictory, and in Wisconsin (11 votes). And he must squeeze Ralph Nader's Green support to take Minnesota (10), Oregon (7) and Washington state (11). </p> <p>The most recent electoral college survey by Reuters showed Mr Gore lagging, with 196 votes solid or leaning his way, against Mr Bush's 209. This leaves 133 in states that are too close to call. </p> <p><b>Could there be an upset?</b><br> Al Gore's Democratic camp hopes to upset the odds by winning the electoral college votes of the handful of key states that are too close to predict. Therefore, Mr Gore may become president even though more people nationwide voted for the Republican Mr Bush. </p> <p>If that were to happen - a Gore win in the electoral college despite a Bush victory in the popular vote - it will be the third time in US electoral history.

I suspect this will prove unfounded. Marr may not be a great newspaperman - his brief editorship of the Independent was a disaster - but he is long on integrity and will bend over backwards to be fair to those whose views he does not share. The point here, however is that the BBC does not need Marr to set it on a leftward leaning course, because running through the corporation, from top to bottom, like the word Blackpool through a stick of rock, is a liberal agenda, set by patronising, middle-class, guilt-ridden do-gooders who dominate its corridors. The worst examples can be heard daily on Radio 4. If this were your only source of news and information, you would inevitably conclude that happily married Anglo-Saxon, heterosexual law-abiding tax-payers are a dying breed on these islands. No doubt, someone from the BBC will dub me a homophobic racist for saying so - a charge I reject - but Radio 4's programming displays an obsessive obsequiousness to the interests and concerns of social and ethnic minorities, the unemployed, and those who enjoy denigrating conventional values. The BBC should, of course, cater for all sections of Britain. And that includes financially secure, hard-working citizens (ie, the vast majority), who are proud of this country, content with their lot, and do not regard the Union Jack as a symbol of evil. Politically correct Radio 4 gives far too much credence to the claims of professional gripers who want compensation, usually in the form of government hand-outs, simply for being less well-off than they would like. By contrast, the flagship station's coverage of business matters is almost non-existent. The Financial World Tonight was shunted off to the graveyard slot of 11.15pm on Radio 5 long ago. Business is rarely covered in Radio 4 news bulletins, unless it is a story about a beastly multi-national making workers redundant or fat-cat directors collecting outrageous salaries. It is as though this country's executive class, whose taxes underpin the funding of the BBC, does not exist. The BBC's new director general, Greg Dyke, made a personal fortune from business.

The product is being launched today by Connextra, a technology company focused on information-based software. David King Lassman, founder and chief executive of Connextra, explained that Sidewize would make the internet more easily accessible for users. He said the need for an add-on browser was borne out of the increasingly frustrating experience of using the web. Sidewize is a side bar that sits on the right of the browser window suggesting links to other relevant content on signed up publishers' websites. For instance, if a user is viewing a story on FT.com about the BBC, Sidewize will suggest they visit Mediatheguardian.com to read additional stories and information. To this end, the tool is mainly a traffic builder but also has potential for targeted advertising. Lucy Wood, head of active travel at Emap Online, which has signed 1Ski.com up to Sidewize, said: \"Sidewize allows us to stick by our users providing them with invaluable timely information relevant to their current web activity. \"We hope to launch many additional services that give leverage to the Sidewize technology in the near future.\" Other content partners include Ticketmaster, ZDNet, Motley Fool, dotmusic, Britannica, Ask Jeeves, Lonely Planet, TeamTalk and Firebox. Sidewize is the first product to be launched by Connextra, which has raised almost \u00a36m in funding.",

The poll findings suggest that farmers and hauliers risk a backlash if they try to bring Britain to a standstill when the government refuses tomorrow to bow to their demands for a big cut in fuel tax. A majority of the public would still back further disruption but support appears to be declining. The backing found by ICM is marginally down on poll results published at the weekend and well below the groundswell of support during September's protest when 80% backed the protesters' aims. ICM found 39% of the public, including a majority of Labour voters, opposed any new blockades, as the home secretary Jack Straw claimed that the government was finally winning the propaganda battle. The government's hand will also be strengthened after the survey found that a clear majority of voters, 56%, believe that raising pensions should take priority over reducing the cost of motoring. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown will hold separate meetings with pensioners' leaders today, ahead of the chancellor's pre-budget statement tomorrow in which the elderly are expected to do better than the hauliers. With the single pension expected to go up by \u00a35 a week and that of a married couple by \u00a38, fuel duty is likely to be frozen for two years - worth 2p a litre this financial year - rather than cut. Mr Straw said: \"The public understands that there are competing priorities for the same money, not least the claim of the pensioners.\" Rodney Bickerstaffe, the retiring head of the Unison public service workers union, said: \"A \u00a35 increase may offer a short-term boost to pensions, but unless a regular uprating such as the link with earnings is restored, the state pension will continue to wither on the vine.\" Improving public transport and cutting fares is also favoured by the government over cheaper motoring, but the longer-term damage to Labour inflicted by the fuel crisis is underlined by the poll, which shows Labour stuck on 40% and the Conservatives dropping by one point to 34%. September's Tory lead has been reversed, though Labour's relatively slender advantage will heighten the pressure on Mr Brown to use his pre-budget statement as an electoral springboard. Aware of the potential unpopularity of new demonstra tions, protest leaders have attempted to row back during recent days from earlier threats to disrupt Britain as tensions surface within the network of hauliers and farmers over how to press home their demands. Support for the petrol protesters, according to the Guardian/ ICM survey, is greatest among the truckers' own C2 social grouping. Mr Brown yesterday warned the Confederation of British Industry conference in Birmingham that the 26p fuel tax cut demanded by some protesters would drive up interest rates and jeopardise the economy. \"The budget will respond to the genuine concerns of hauliers and motorists but I will do nothing that would risk returning the economy to 1980s boom and bust,\" he said. Mr Blair's deputy spokesman, Godric Smith, gave clear endorsement to a threat by Mike Hodgkinson, the BAA chief executive, that his company would take out injunctions against any protesters who blocked the M25 and thereby impeded travel to and from Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Heathrow alone has 100,000 workers and ships \u00a360bn worth of cargo a year, Mr Hodgkinson told the airport's transport forum. His warnings are the latest twist in the government's get-tough rhetoric since steps were instigated, after the September blockades, to counter any similar action in the future. In a significant move, the Tory leader William Hague and Michael Portillo, the shadow chancellor, both rejected in advance hints that Mr Brown will merely freeze petrol duties.

Mark Francis, who has effectively sidelined David Handley as chief spokesman for the People's Fuel Lobby after dissension over his role within the group, said calls for mayhem by other leaders had been misreported and that next week's motorway demonstration should not be disruptive. \"The aim is not to block the motorway,\" Mr Francis said of the lorry convoy scheduled to leave Jarrow on Friday for a London demonstration next Tuesday. \"The vehicles should travel at a safe speed and listen to the police. All this talk of mayhem is poppycock.\" The pronouncement represents a retreat from recent threats of renewed blockades - against fuel distribution centres and railways and action to disrupt the national grid - if the chancellor, Gordon Brown, fails to meet protesters' demands for a sharp cut in fuel duty. It is also in sharp contrast with remarks made by Nigel Kime, spokesman of British Hauliers Unite and a member of Mr Francis's group, who was quoted yesterday as warning that if the truckers were prevented from demonstrating in London, they would \"bugger up three major airports\". The British Airports Authority yesterday threatened injunctions against fuel protest leaders if there were attempts to blockade the M25 or airports. Mr Francis argued that Mr Kime had not been reported accurately and said: \"Anyone who goes to the national grid, the railways or food distribution centres will be taking their own and other people's lives into their hands.

Meanwhile, the People's Fuel Lobby came under attack from John Bridge, chairman of the Road Haulage Association - also John Major's Tory constituency chairman in Huntingdon - for using \"clandestine and undemocratic\" methods. Mr Bridge said he and like-minded others had been excluded from the People's Fuel Lobby, even though the RHA represented 10,000 hauliers. The continuing dissension among the protest leaders reflects both tactical and personality differences and a realisation they have lost crucial allies and the element of surprise that helped make the September refinery blockades so successful. The anti-fuel tax alliance, which two months ago became the focus for wider anti-government discontent, has already begun to fracture in the face of government preparations for a second round. Differences of interest between farmers and hauliers have manifested within the protest groups, which have now also been heavily infiltrated by police special branch. The oil companies, whose passivity towards the September blockades was a vital element in their success, are back in harness with the government. The Tory leadership, which was singing the praises of the \"fine upstanding citizens\" who led the blockades, has distanced itself from further disruption and newspapers which backed the September protests are now urging caution. Most significantly, the Daily Mail, which played a key role as a focus for the anti-fuel tax protest movement both before and during the blockades has told the farmers and hauliers to \"think long and hard about taking further action\". Few on the protesters' side believe whatever concessions Mr Brown makes tomorrow will measure up to demands. But the expectation is increasingly that, while disruptive protests are almost certain to resume next week, they are unlikely to have the national impact of the September upheaval.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>His seven trucks are among more than 400,000 plying the highways for an ever-diminishing return. Craig Eley has lost count of the times he has asked customers - invariably supermarket groups and food related companies - for an increase to compensate for rapidly rising fuel prices.</p> <p>\"I've tried everything, itemised every cost, but they think we're fiddling the figures and we haven't had a rise in two years,\" he sighs in an office-cum-garage just off the A1 in Gateshead where he launched a string of nationwide rolling road blocks in September. For some time, he laments, business has been so cut-throat that customers have been dividing and ruling, threatening to take contracts elsewhere if hauliers whinge too much. \"They just say 'Craig, if you can't do it we'll get somebody else'.\"</p> <p>It is the end of another depressing week and time for the calculator: a trip to Birmingham, for instance, which has netted \u00a3435 (\u00a3235 outward and only \u00a3200 for a the traditionally cheaper return 'back load'). With two days' wages to pay for that trip (\u00a3140), diesel for trucks which consume a gallon every seven miles (\u00a3194), maintenance (\u00a330), insurance and tax (\u00a324), and a modest night-out allowance for the driver (\u00a320), he says he has had to fork out a total of \u00a3408 - leaving a tiny profit of \u00a327. He is considering putting four of his seven trucks on the market, and maybe packing in altogether. \"We are hovering between making a profit on some trips and a loss on others. You just can't keep going on like this.\"</p> <p>But the hauliers' public enemy number one is not necessarily the government, but another group which partly controls road transport in Britain - the retail and food industry. Would truckers be significantly better off if Gordon Brown bowed to their pressure and cut diesel duty by 30p a litre this week? Privately, some transport companies say it is likely that supermarkets would then attempt to drive haulage prices down even further. \"There is a macho culture for retailers and manufacturers to squeeze hauliers to the limit,\" says Professor Alan McKinnon, of the transport studies group at Heriot Watt University and a leading haulage expert.</p> <p>But with more trucks chasing fewer orders, are there simply too many lorries for the available work? And with a 1,000-litre tank of diesel costing \u00a3840 in the UK and only \u00a3550 in France, do hauliers have a reasonable argument when they complain that fuel taxes in Britain are forcing them out of business - or are other, less-publicised factors responsible? And is there a strong environmental case for keeping taxes high to make hauliers pay for damage they inflict on roads and the carbons they pump into the atmosphere?</p> <p><b> High fuel taxes?</b></p> <p>Road hauliers say the 48p per litre fuel duty is crippling the industry. The Freight Transport Association puts the fuel duty for a 40-tonne truck - undertaking 70,000 miles annually at barely eight miles to the gallon - at \u00a320,000, plus another \u00a33,950 for a licence.</p> <p>But when higher corporation tax, road tolls and other factors are taken into account - such as a lorry ban in some EU countries at weekends - some experts have calculated that the differential between UK fuel taxes and Europe narrows to just 5%. In a survey comparing haulage costs between the UK, Holland, France, Luxembourg and Belgium, accountants Ernst and Young also say the Europeans have much less of an advantage than the trucking industry claims, with higher payroll charges, taxes and road tolls outweighing cheaper fuel.</p> <p><b> Too many lorries?</b></p> <p>Experts disagree. John Whitelegg, professor of environmental studies at Liverpool's John Moores University, estimates a third of the country's 400,000 trucks - run by 110,000 operators - are running without freight at any one time. With road haulage carrying 90% of UK freight - far more than most European countries - he says rail, canals and sea transport (in a country with 300 ports) should take more. Prof McKinnon, however, says that since the \"intensely competitive\" industry was deregulated in 1970, it may have found its natural size.</p> <p><b> Business squeezing the hauliers?</b></p> <p>There seems little doubt that supermarkets, food companies and others are exploiting excess capacity to keep their transport costs to a minimum.

      "bodyText": "His seven trucks are among more than 400,000 plying the highways for an ever-diminishing return. Craig Eley has lost count of the times he has asked customers - invariably supermarket groups and food related companies - for an increase to compensate for rapidly rising fuel prices. \"I've tried everything, itemised every cost, but they think we're fiddling the figures and we haven't had a rise in two years,\" he sighs in an office-cum-garage just off the A1 in Gateshead where he launched a string of nationwide rolling road blocks in September. For some time, he laments, business has been so cut-throat that customers have been dividing and ruling, threatening to take contracts elsewhere if hauliers whinge too much. \"They just say 'Craig, if you can't do it we'll get somebody else'.\" It is the end of another depressing week and time for the calculator: a trip to Birmingham, for instance, which has netted \u00a3435 (\u00a3235 outward and only \u00a3200 for a the traditionally cheaper return 'back load'). With two days' wages to pay for that trip (\u00a3140), diesel for trucks which consume a gallon every seven miles (\u00a3194), maintenance (\u00a330), insurance and tax (\u00a324), and a modest night-out allowance for the driver (\u00a320), he says he has had to fork out a total of \u00a3408 - leaving a tiny profit of \u00a327. He is considering putting four of his seven trucks on the market, and maybe packing in altogether. \"We are hovering between making a profit on some trips and a loss on others. You just can't keep going on like this.\" But the hauliers' public enemy number one is not necessarily the government, but another group which partly controls road transport in Britain - the retail and food industry. Would truckers be significantly better off if Gordon Brown bowed to their pressure and cut diesel duty by 30p a litre this week? Privately, some transport companies say it is likely that supermarkets would then attempt to drive haulage prices down even further. \"There is a macho culture for retailers and manufacturers to squeeze hauliers to the limit,\" says Professor Alan McKinnon, of the transport studies group at Heriot Watt University and a leading haulage expert. But with more trucks chasing fewer orders, are there simply too many lorries for the available work? And with a 1,000-litre tank of diesel costing \u00a3840 in the UK and only \u00a3550 in France, do hauliers have a reasonable argument when they complain that fuel taxes in Britain are forcing them out of business - or are other, less-publicised factors responsible? And is there a strong environmental case for keeping taxes high to make hauliers pay for damage they inflict on roads and the carbons they pump into the atmosphere? High fuel taxes? Road hauliers say the 48p per litre fuel duty is crippling the industry. The Freight Transport Association puts the fuel duty for a 40-tonne truck - undertaking 70,000 miles annually at barely eight miles to the gallon - at \u00a320,000, plus another \u00a33,950 for a licence. But when higher corporation tax, road tolls and other factors are taken into account - such as a lorry ban in some EU countries at weekends - some experts have calculated that the differential between UK fuel taxes and Europe narrows to just 5%. In a survey comparing haulage costs between the UK, Holland, France, Luxembourg and Belgium, accountants Ernst and Young also say the Europeans have much less of an advantage than the trucking industry claims, with higher payroll charges, taxes and road tolls outweighing cheaper fuel. Too many lorries? Experts disagree. John Whitelegg, professor of environmental studies at Liverpool's John Moores University, estimates a third of the country's 400,000 trucks - run by 110,000 operators - are running without freight at any one time. With road haulage carrying 90% of UK freight - far more than most European countries - he says rail, canals and sea transport (in a country with 300 ports) should take more. Prof McKinnon, however, says that since the \"intensely competitive\" industry was deregulated in 1970, it may have found its natural size. Business squeezing the hauliers? There seems little doubt that supermarkets, food companies and others are exploiting excess capacity to keep their transport costs to a minimum. Prof Mc-Kinnon recalls a discussion with a senior Treasury official who was surprised that hauliers were enraged by fuel tax increases. \"Surely they will simply pass on the increase to their clients?\" he asked. If that had happened, McKinnon says there would have been no blockades in September - let alone the threat of more protests next week - because the cost would have been passed down the supply chain. He has calculated that if the one third increase in hauliers' fuel costs over the past three years had been passed in full to shoppers, just over 20p would be added to a \u00a3100 family shopping bill - \"barely perceptible\".

Having gone through eight premiers in 10 miserable years, the Japanese electorate have little love for their political leaders, but Mr Mori - described by friends as a gentle and well-intentioned man - has managed to hit new levels of unpopularity with his old-fashioned views and ill-judged statements. Yesterday, a poll in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper gave him an impressively bad disapproval rating of 71%, the worst for any prime minister since the ruling Liberal Democratic party last lost power in 1993. In the same survey, only 6% of voters thought that he was the best man to run the country, putting him in sixth place. Outside a small circle of associates, nobody has a good word for him. Raise the subject of Mr Mori with a neighbour or taxi driver, and the first response is usually a scornful laugh, often followed by the words \"he's an embarrassment to Japan\". In press conferences, several Japanese journalists have refused to use polite forms of address when asking Mr Mori questions - a shocking departure from protocol in a country that places such importance on good manners, respect for hierarchy and close ties between senior politicians and their assigned reporters. Politicians need thick skins, but the portly premier cannot fail to have been hurt earlier this month when he attended the national stadium to watch a game of his beloved rugby only to be booed by the crowd. Even in his own party, several prominent young members have called for his resignation. As numerous editorials and commentaries have pointed out, Mr Mori has brought much of this scorn upon himself, both by the secretive way he took power and the amateurish way that he has exercised it. Nobody forgets that he was chosen behind closed doors by five faction leaders in the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) - a typical appointment based on loyalty rather than leadership qualities. Mr Mori has kept political writers busy ever since by putting his foot in his mouth on an almost monthly basis. His gaffes are legendary. Some - like his reference to Japan as a land of gods that is centered on the emperor - reveal a mind still stuck in the pre-war militarist era. Others - such as his misspelling of IT - suggest a man who is more comfortable with the glad-handing and geisha parties of old-style Japanese politics than modern campaigning by email and the internet. Mr Mori has also made several disastrous appointments of ministers who were very quickly forced to resign amid bribery and sex scandals. Last week, his right-hand man, the chief cabinet secretary Hidenao Nakagawa, was forced to stand down amid a barrage of allegations. Mr Mori can now do no right. Journalists hang on his every word, waiting for a slip, many of which are nothing of the sort. Last month, the prime minister was harangued for sharing sensitive information about North Korea with Tony Blair, though the fault lay not with Mr Mori, but with his indiscrete spokesman who decided to pass that confidential conversation on to the world. This is not to excuse the hapless premier, but he is a symptom rather than a cause of Japan's sick political system. With regular elections but only one brief change of government in 45 years, Japanese-style democracy has always seemed anomalous with the British parliamentary system on which it is supposed to be modeled. In theory, the ruling LDP is accountable to the electorate, but in practice there has never been an opposition party capable of offering a viable alternative. This did not matter for most of the postwar period, when the LDP adroitly ensured an even distribution of wealth around the nation, albeit often through bribes, bid-rigging and dubious favours for supporters in agriculture and construction. But, after a decade-long economic pinch, that system is looking increasingly anachronistic and inefficient, especially to urban voters who pay the majority of the country's taxes. To them, Mr Mori has become a symbol of a political world that remains stuck firmly in the past, even as corporate Japan goes through the painful process of modernisation. The salaryman's evening newspaper - the Gendai - put this in even stronger terms yesterday, calling the prime ministers and other LDP leaders \"cancers eating away at the body of our nation\". In Kasumigaseki - Japan's political heartland - speculation is now rife that Mr Mori will not last until the end of the year. History suggests his position is precarious: no prime minister with a support rate under 20% has ever survived more than three months. But proponents of reform may be disappointed again. Mr Mori's main rival in the LDP - Koichi Kato - has become increasingly critical of the government, but his allies say that he is unlikely to make a move unless the prime minister's rating slip below 10%. The opposition Democratic party of Japan, meanwhile, has amazingly failed to capitalise on Mr Mori's misfortune. Racked by internal divisions, they have lost considerable credibility by boycotting parliament twice this year. In the latest poll, they were seven points behind the LDP. Even more than the pathetic figure of Mr Mori, this lack of an alternative for voters is the saddest aspect of Japanese politics and one that may well ensure that the current prime minister will not be the last laughing stock in the nation's top post.

According to the poll, Mr Bush leads Mr Gore in the national popular vote by 47% to 46%, with Green candidate Ralph Nader on 4% and the Reform party's Pat Buchanan 1%. But Mr Gore leads Mr Bush in the electoral college, the same poll suggests, with a winning total of 286 votes to 241.

But what is special about the Harris Interactive survey is that it combines the two findings in a single huge state-by-state survey of American opinion, with a sufficiently large sample to take the possibility out of the realm of fantasy and place it in the realm of reality. Harris's survey contacted an unprecedentedly large sample of 134,000 likely voters online in 50 states between October 30 and November 4 before weighting their replies by age, sex, education, race, urban or rural home and propensity to be online. Most of the state samples are sufficiently large for their results to be much more statistically reliable than most other polls. The sample in the largest state, California, was 14,632 while that from Alaska was 591.

Fuelled by a steadily increasing number of BSE cases uncovered in France, fears are mounting.

In a statement to police, he said he had \"no reason or motive, financial or otherwise, to kill my wife\".</p> <p>The couple had been married for seven years at the time of Mrs Phillips's death and had three children, Nicholas Hilliard, prosecuting, told Southwark crown court. They owned two children's nurseries in Fulham. At the beginning of this year, they sold one for more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>The couple slept in separate beds in their semi-detached, three-storey house. Mrs Phillips's bedroom, which had an en suite bathroom, was on the first floor. Mr Phillips slept in the office on the top floor, the court heard.</p> <p>On May 15 a friend of Mrs Phillips, who telephoned her at 8.37pm, said that she sounded \"very cheerful and her normal self\".</p> <p>Mr Hilliard said: \"This is the last time the prosecution can say for certain that Mrs Phillips was alive.\"</p> <p>At 7.50am the next day, a school bus driver, who came to the house to collect one of the children, told the court that he was greeted by Mr Phillips and two of his children.

      "bodyText": "A millionaire businessman murdered his wife in the bath of their home and then claimed an intruder was responsible for her death, a court was told yesterday. Nadine Phillips, 34, was found naked and face down in the bath in the family home in Putney, south-west London, in May. Bruises on her arms, hips and back indicated she had been \"forced down\" into the water, the pathologist who examined the body said. Her husband, Alun Phillips, 36, denies murder. In a statement to police, he said he had \"no reason or motive, financial or otherwise, to kill my wife\". The couple had been married for seven years at the time of Mrs Phillips's death and had three children, Nicholas Hilliard, prosecuting, told Southwark crown court. They owned two children's nurseries in Fulham. At the beginning of this year, they sold one for more than \u00a31m. The couple slept in separate beds in their semi-detached, three-storey house. Mrs Phillips's bedroom, which had an en suite bathroom, was on the first floor. Mr Phillips slept in the office on the top floor, the court heard. On May 15 a friend of Mrs Phillips, who telephoned her at 8.37pm, said that she sounded \"very cheerful and her normal self\". Mr Hilliard said: \"This is the last time the prosecution can say for certain that Mrs Phillips was alive.\" At 7.50am the next day, a school bus driver, who came to the house to collect one of the children, told the court that he was greeted by Mr Phillips and two of his children. The driver said that Mr Phillips would usually put a note on the door asking him to knock rather than press the buzzer when his wife slept in. There was no note on the door on May 15. At 10.30am, Mr Phillips telephoned for an ambulance and said there was \"a problem\" with his wife. Mr Hilliard said that a member of the ambulance crew told Mr Phillips that the temperature and stiffness of his wife's body suggested she had been dead for several hours. \"The defendant started shouting and said his wife had been involved in an incident the night before with a 'fucking nutcase',\" Mr Hilliard said. The jury of six men and six women was told Mrs Phillips had made an appointment with her doctor at 9.30am that day. In a statement to police, Mr Phillips claimed that at around 8.30pm on May 15, his wife had told him that she had seen a stranger at the front door of their home. \"He also told police that his wife had described the man involved in this incident as weird... and he said he had been worried recently about someone hanging about the house,\" Mr Hilliard told the court. Mr Phillips told police that he had found the front door open at 11.30pm and set the alarm just before midnight. He did not check on his wife until the next morning. The court heard that the alarm went off just before 1am. It was deactivated moments later and not reset for the rest of the night. Mr Hilliard said that Mr Phillips was \"very security conscious\". The family home was fitted with protective grilles, an alarm, a video entry system and the front door had several locks and bolts. The trial continues.",

Ministers have instructed the medicines control agency (MCA) to conduct urgent checks on brand names such as Day Nurse, Night Nurse, Contact 400, Sinutab, Benylin and Vicks. The products will remain on sale but the Department of Health last night advised concerned members of the public to contact their GP or chemist. The alarm was raised after the American food and drug administration determined that an ingredient called phenylpropanolamine (PPA), used in drugs to suppress patients' appetites was unsafe.

      "body": "<p>In Brooklyn's Crown Heights, Sandra Brathwaite stands at the top of her block and delivers an ethnic inventory. \"That side is all Jewish,\" she says, pointing to the right. \"And this side is black... well a mix of African-American and Caribbean really. But the Jews have started moving over.\" As she continues down Eastern Parkway, her vocal audit keeps pace with her stride. \"This house is black, that house is black, that one is Jewish, the next three are black, the one after that is Jewish... I could go on.\"</p> <p>On one side of the street, the African-American flag flies from the black firefighters hall; on the other, inscriptions on an ambulance and posters on lamp-posts are in Yiddish. Geographically close yet culturally distant, politically united yet mutually antagonistic, once economically interdependent, now socially stratified - the story of the relationship between African-Americans and Jews is long and complex. It is a narrative stretching back through the last century and beyond, which has veered from the inspiring to the horrific. They were once great allies during the civil rights era and within the Democratic party, but more recently have been bitter and sometimes bloody foes.</p> <p>But now black-Jewish relations seem to be entering a more optimistic, if uncertain phase. The nomination of Joseph Lieberman, a Jewish senator from Connecticut, as running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, has proved an unlikely catalyst for a desire on both sides for greater understanding, if not reconciliation. Lieberman's nomination received the warm endorsement of the Reverend Jesse Jackson - once reviled in the Jewish community for referring to New York as \"Heimie town\". Lieberman in turn has extended an olive branch to the leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan - the man who branded Judaism \"a gutter religion\" and called Hitler \"a great man\". Farrakhan looks as though he may accept. \"I would welcome a meeting... it could be a bridge between the black community and the Jewish community,\" he said.</p> <p>There has been as much pragmatism in this as principle. African-Americans are the most loyal constituency the Democrats have. Since the second world war the Democratic party has only once won the presidency - with Lyndon Johnson in 1964 - with a majority of the white vote. One of Lieberman's first visits after being officially nominated this summer was to the Congressional black caucus.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Farrakhan's church is struggling to overcome high-level defections, following accusations of adultery and federal lawsuits alleging sexual harassment. Farrakhan, who is suffering from prostate cancer, is in search of a meaningful legacy. His attempt to cement one earlier this month through the Million Family March failed, thanks to a poor turnout. Reinventing himself as a religious and racial healer rather than an anti-semitic firebreather may be his last hope.</p> <p>Embarking on this new route has not been without its obstacles on both sides. Explaining the rationale behind Lieberman's selection, Harlem's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, wrote in an editorial: \"The reasoning in the Gore camp went out all over the world to Jews of means: 'You've got to show me the money.' The word went out... that the major protector of Jews in this world, the American government, is now available.\" Meanwhile, two major Jewish lobbying organisations, the Anti-Defamation League and the Republican Jewish Coalition, urged Lieberman to stay away from Farrakhan.</p> <p>One reason for this climate of mistrust and antagonism is economic. Pogroms and poverty sent a large number of Jews to America from eastern Europe at the beginning of the last century; roughly the same time that racism and poverty delivered African-Americans from the south to the north. As is the case in Crown Heights today, they often lived cheek by jowl. With access to mortgages, loans or a decent education denied to most African-Americans and granted to Jews - because they were white - an unequal economic relationship soon developed.</p> <p>James Baldwin, in his essay The Harlem Ghetto, wrote of Jews, particularly Jewish landlords, \"They operate in accordance with the American business tradition of exploiting negroes and they are therefore identified with oppression and are hated for it.\" In short, the standard tension between landlords and tenants or employers and employees took on an ethnic dimension. As Jews advanced economically and moved out of black areas, this particular relationship died, but the prejudice continued.</p> <p>This is reflected in polling data. \"There are certain stereotypes that black Americans are more likely to believe about Jews than white Americans,\" says Tom Smith, a social scientist at the university of Chicago. \"Namely, that Jews are 'unscrupulous in business' and 'mean about money'. In all other aspects they are no more negative than white Americans.\"</p> <p>Nor, some are keen to point out, does the fact that both groups endure discrimination mean that they cannot also inflict it. Jews are still white, and African-Americans are still gentiles; the former can still be racist; the latter can still be anti-semitic. Nowhere was this clearer than in Crown Heights almost 10 years ago, after a Hasidic driver ran over a seven-year-old African American boy and was then attacked by a mob. A Hasidic ambulance arrived first and took care of the driver while the boy and his injured cousin had to wait for a city ambulance. The boy died. Hours later black youths killed a rabbinical student in revenge. Riots ensued.</p> <p>Add an organisation like the Nation of Islam to the mix, says David Bositis, a senior political analyst at the joint centre for political and economic studies in Washington, and the possible points of conflict grow. \"Muslims and Jewish people are at odds. Jews are basically white and the NOI's creed is that the devil created white people. On those grounds alone you wouldn't expect them to get on.\"</p> <p>Bositis believes that to concentrate on Farrakhan's anti-semitism is to misunderstand both his function and his importance. \"He's said a lot of things that are anti-semitic, but the question is, does it represent anything significant about black politics? The answer is no. It may be central to his message but not to his meaning.\"</p> <p>None of this makes solidarity between Jews and African-Americans impossible. Far from it. Jews were overrepresented in the struggle for civil rights, partly because they had a keen sense of what it meant to be denied rights. There was an element of self-preservation in it too: the principal target for southern bigotry was blacks, but Jews were not far behind.

      "bodyText": "In Brooklyn's Crown Heights, Sandra Brathwaite stands at the top of her block and delivers an ethnic inventory. \"That side is all Jewish,\" she says, pointing to the right. \"And this side is black... well a mix of African-American and Caribbean really. But the Jews have started moving over.\" As she continues down Eastern Parkway, her vocal audit keeps pace with her stride. \"This house is black, that house is black, that one is Jewish, the next three are black, the one after that is Jewish... I could go on.\" On one side of the street, the African-American flag flies from the black firefighters hall; on the other, inscriptions on an ambulance and posters on lamp-posts are in Yiddish. Geographically close yet culturally distant, politically united yet mutually antagonistic, once economically interdependent, now socially stratified - the story of the relationship between African-Americans and Jews is long and complex. It is a narrative stretching back through the last century and beyond, which has veered from the inspiring to the horrific. They were once great allies during the civil rights era and within the Democratic party, but more recently have been bitter and sometimes bloody foes. But now black-Jewish relations seem to be entering a more optimistic, if uncertain phase. The nomination of Joseph Lieberman, a Jewish senator from Connecticut, as running mate to the Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, has proved an unlikely catalyst for a desire on both sides for greater understanding, if not reconciliation. Lieberman's nomination received the warm endorsement of the Reverend Jesse Jackson - once reviled in the Jewish community for referring to New York as \"Heimie town\". Lieberman in turn has extended an olive branch to the leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan - the man who branded Judaism \"a gutter religion\" and called Hitler \"a great man\". Farrakhan looks as though he may accept. \"I would welcome a meeting... it could be a bridge between the black community and the Jewish community,\" he said. There has been as much pragmatism in this as principle. African-Americans are the most loyal constituency the Democrats have. Since the second world war the Democratic party has only once won the presidency - with Lyndon Johnson in 1964 - with a majority of the white vote. One of Lieberman's first visits after being officially nominated this summer was to the Congressional black caucus. Meanwhile, Farrakhan's church is struggling to overcome high-level defections, following accusations of adultery and federal lawsuits alleging sexual harassment. Farrakhan, who is suffering from prostate cancer, is in search of a meaningful legacy. His attempt to cement one earlier this month through the Million Family March failed, thanks to a poor turnout. Reinventing himself as a religious and racial healer rather than an anti-semitic firebreather may be his last hope. Embarking on this new route has not been without its obstacles on both sides. Explaining the rationale behind Lieberman's selection, Harlem's black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, wrote in an editorial: \"The reasoning in the Gore camp went out all over the world to Jews of means: 'You've got to show me the money.' The word went out... that the major protector of Jews in this world, the American government, is now available.\" Meanwhile, two major Jewish lobbying organisations, the Anti-Defamation League and the Republican Jewish Coalition, urged Lieberman to stay away from Farrakhan. One reason for this climate of mistrust and antagonism is economic. Pogroms and poverty sent a large number of Jews to America from eastern Europe at the beginning of the last century; roughly the same time that racism and poverty delivered African-Americans from the south to the north. As is the case in Crown Heights today, they often lived cheek by jowl. With access to mortgages, loans or a decent education denied to most African-Americans and granted to Jews - because they were white - an unequal economic relationship soon developed. James Baldwin, in his essay The Harlem Ghetto, wrote of Jews, particularly Jewish landlords, \"They operate in accordance with the American business tradition of exploiting negroes and they are therefore identified with oppression and are hated for it.\" In short, the standard tension between landlords and tenants or employers and employees took on an ethnic dimension. As Jews advanced economically and moved out of black areas, this particular relationship died, but the prejudice continued. This is reflected in polling data. \"There are certain stereotypes that black Americans are more likely to believe about Jews than white Americans,\" says Tom Smith, a social scientist at the university of Chicago. \"Namely, that Jews are 'unscrupulous in business' and 'mean about money'. In all other aspects they are no more negative than white Americans.\" Nor, some are keen to point out, does the fact that both groups endure discrimination mean that they cannot also inflict it. Jews are still white, and African-Americans are still gentiles; the former can still be racist; the latter can still be anti-semitic. Nowhere was this clearer than in Crown Heights almost 10 years ago, after a Hasidic driver ran over a seven-year-old African American boy and was then attacked by a mob. A Hasidic ambulance arrived first and took care of the driver while the boy and his injured cousin had to wait for a city ambulance. The boy died. Hours later black youths killed a rabbinical student in revenge. Riots ensued. Add an organisation like the Nation of Islam to the mix, says David Bositis, a senior political analyst at the joint centre for political and economic studies in Washington, and the possible points of conflict grow. \"Muslims and Jewish people are at odds. Jews are basically white and the NOI's creed is that the devil created white people. On those grounds alone you wouldn't expect them to get on.\" Bositis believes that to concentrate on Farrakhan's anti-semitism is to misunderstand both his function and his importance. \"He's said a lot of things that are anti-semitic, but the question is, does it represent anything significant about black politics? The answer is no. It may be central to his message but not to his meaning.\" None of this makes solidarity between Jews and African-Americans impossible. Far from it. Jews were overrepresented in the struggle for civil rights, partly because they had a keen sense of what it meant to be denied rights. There was an element of self-preservation in it too: the principal target for southern bigotry was blacks, but Jews were not far behind. When legislation came to remove many of the legal barriers to equality, Jews would benefit too. Because Jews have experienced discrimination first hand, Bositis says, \"On balance they are less racist than the typical white person.\" It is facile to trade off the two groups' completely different experiences of oppression, as though the Holocaust and slavery were two chips in a poker game of victimisation. This not only belittles the suffering but insults the sufferer. In 1926, Louis Marshall, a Jewish jurist and supporter of black rights, addressed the convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with tales of massacres of Jews in Europe. \"We were subject to indignities in comparison with which to sit in a Jim Crow car is to occupy a palace,\" he said to a stunned and angry audience. Never were these differences more apparent than in the post-civil rights era of Black Power. \"Black people felt they had to assert control of the movement, and there wasn't much room for any whites, including Jewish people, in that,\" says Smith. The two groups became estranged by class as well as race and religion. Jews, as a community, got wealthier, while blacks, on the whole, remained at the bottom of the pile. \"There are class differences as you would understand them in Europe,\" says Smith, \"in terms of whole culture, education, expectations, rather than just money.\" This created tensions that have been most evident around affirmative action - a matter of great importance to African-Americans. Smith says, \"Jews are more likely to believe that affirmative action might exacerbate differences than assuage them.\" Some say this is because before the war many universities established quotas to restrict Jewish entrants. The quotas were removed, thanks to the struggle for civil rights, but because Jews fought against them on principle then, many still oppose them now.

      "bodyText": "Not content with shattering all known spending records at every stage of the 2000 election, America's political parties will today blow another $100m (\u00a369m) on a final orgy of spending to get voters to the polls. With the national opinion polls suggesting a last-minute tightening in the race between Al Gore and George W Bush, and an unusually large number of swing states still considered up for grabs, everything now comes down to which candidate has the superior organisation in the desperate contest for the White House. In a race in which less than half of the eligible electorate is likely to vote today, the winner will be the man who can do what the professionals call mobilising the base - a contest in which polls suggest Republicans are generally more likely to turn out than Democrats. In big battleground states like Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, voters are being bombarded with leaflets, telephone calls, emails and old-fashioned knocks on the door. The stakes could hardly be higher or more evenly balanced. The final national polls yesterday continued to show Mr Bush in the lead, but Mr Gore was apparently closing the gap in the final hours, leaving most of the poll findings within the margin of error. The final Gallup daily tracking poll showed Mr Bush leading 47% to 45%, while the Zogby International daily tracking poll had the race even closer, with Mr Bush ahead 47% to 46%. A new poll of likely voters by the Pew Research Centre showed Mr Bush leading 49% to 47%, with the Green Party candidate Ralph Nader on 4%. The tightness of the race ensured that the contest will be decided in the battleground states of the north-west and midwest, as well as Florida, where Mr Gore was due to end his final day of campaigning last night. Mr Bush showed his confidence by choosing to make two of his final four state visits of the campaign in Bill Clinton's Arkansas and in Mr Gore's Tennessee. Phone campaigning A series of tracking polls by Zogby International in nine of the swing states gave encouragement to both sides, with Mr Bush leading in Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin and Mr Gore's home state of Tennessee, while Mr Gore had the lead in Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Washington. Many of the state findings were inside the margin of error. The biggest development this year has been the proliferation of different new technologies in the \"get out the vote\" effort. The internet is at the heart of both parties' organisational efforts, but the main way to reach voters on polling day remains the telephone. Americans are already well accustomed to tele-marketing by commercial organisations, but cheaper telephone calls, higher campaign fundraising and the shrinking of the numbers of voters prepared to turn out have combined to make the telephone appeal the most effective of all last-minute campaign weapons for both parties. Automated calls from celebrities and leading politicians will begin going out from the early hours this morning, and will continue right up to the close of the polls. President Clinton may not have been very visible on the campaign trail this year, but his phone calls were going into tens of thousands of households yesterday and today, urging a vote for Mr Gore. Younger women voters in swing states can expect to calls from television star Sarah Jessica Parker, who is fronting a huge phone effort by abortion rights groups. On the Republican side, General Nor man Schwarzkopf can be heard in Michigan, Missouri and Florida urging a vote for Mr Bush, while well-resourced lobby groups like the National Rifle Association are backing Mr Bush with their own phone efforts in states like Pennsylvania with calls from the association president Charlton Heston. It is in the telephone call war that both sides and their allies are most likely to resort to the negative campaigning and scare tactics that have mostly been absent from the more public phases of this year's campaigns, such as speeches and even television advertising. In Michigan, some black American voters have complained that they have been receiving calls purporting to come from the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People advocating a vote for Mr Bush in the presidential contest. The NAACP is spending $10.5m supporting Mr Gore and the Democrats. In the New York senate race, the Republican Party admits that it has financed more than 50,000 calls including some which link Hillary Clinton, Yasser Arafat and the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen last month and another targeted at Jewish voters which says Mrs Clinton supports the creation of a Palestinian state. \"In the last week, the Marquis of Queensbury rules seem to go out the window,\" says Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the Republican con gressional election campaign. \"Everyone seems to take off the gloves and put on the brass knuckles.\" Party campaigners' tasks have been made even more difficult this time round by the huge growth in postal voting - known here as absentee balloting - and by innovations such as Oregon's decision to abolish all polling stations in favour of votes by mail. Election officials have reported that the demand for absentee ballots has been at an all-time high in key states such as Florida, Illinois and Michigan. States like North Carolina and Mr Bush's Texas allow early voting in person - former president George Bush and his wife Barbara were among those who took advantage of the system last week - making it even harder for party organisations to keep track of who has voted and who has not. In the end, though, the difference between victory and defeat tonight may all come down to shoe leather and person-to-person contacts, as party workers knock on the doors of those who have yet to cast their votes.",

      "bodyText": "Tobacco giants Philip Morris and R J Reynolds are being sued in a New York court for their alleged involvement in smuggling cigarettes into the European Union, it was announced yesterday. In an extraordinary move, the European Commission said the two US corporations - named for the first time in this unprecedented case - were accused of breaches of the US Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organisation Act. Under these laws, introduced to wipe out mob crime, the EU can claim three times the amount of lost revenue from unpaid customs duties and VAT - believed to run into billions of dollars - in compensation. The development adds to the legal difficulties faced by big tobacco companies, recently hit by huge punitive damages awards. Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, is best known for its Marlboro brand. R.J. Reynolds' products include Camel and Winston cigarettes. Michaele Schreyer, the EU budget commissioner, said Brussels was also seeking an injunction preventing further smuggling. \"The present case is a new step in our strategy to fight against fraud and financial irregularities,\" Ms Schreyer said in a statement. Philip Morris yesterday said it would vigorously contest the EU's smuggling allegations and attacked the \"unprecedented\" use of US law courts by a foreign government. The company blamed the fact that it had not seen the lawsuit, which was filed in New York, for its inability to comment on the specific EU allegations. But, in a statement, David Davies, European spokesman for the company, said: \"Philip Morris Europe does not understand why, either as a matter of law or practice, the European Commission has chosen to address this issue in a US court rather than through regulatory and co-operative actions within the framework of the European Union.\" But Clive Bates, director of Ash, the anti-smoking lobby group, said last night: \"The authorities are finally getting to grips with the real commercial drivers behind smuggling - and that's the tobacco companies. These really are the Mr Bigs.\" Last week the Department of Trade and Industry ordered an investigation into allegations that British American Tobacco orchestrated cigarette smuggling. Yesterday's decision to sue Philip Morris and R J Reynolds was taken by the European Commission last July in its role as guardian of the treaties and of the community's $95bn annual budget. It followed a two-year inves tigation by the EU's independent fraud-busting office, Olaf, together with national police and customs authorities. Cigarette smuggling constitutes the biggest single fraud against the budget, with a single container of cigarettes worth almost 1m euros in tax. The civil action was filed last Friday in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Individual European governments may launch similar actions. In some countries, contraband cigarettes account for 10% of all sales. Italy, where the business is run by highly organised Mafia gangs, has a very serious problem with smuggling. Outside the EU, illicit cigarettes are the mainstay of the Montenegran economy, undermining efforts to push through reforms in a country that is already heavily dependent on western aid.

      "body": "<p>The world's most powerful capital is today holding its breath, waiting to discover who its new tenants will be. If Al Gore pulls off a miracle it will presumably be business as usual - more or less the same breed of earnest young Democrats that has been filling the Starbucks branches on Pennsylvania Avenue for the past eight years.</p> <p>If George W Bush triumphs, however, Washington will have to brace itself for a cultural tidal wave rolling in from Texas. If elected, the governor from Austin would inevitably bring a new crowd of advisers, wonks, gurus and hangers-on from the governor's mansion in Austin.</p> <p>There will be many immediate changes. Overnight, cowboy boots will become de rigueur with business suits, and the Texas twang (in both its authentic and ersatz varieties) will reverberate around the cafes of Georgetown.</p> <p>But beneath the froth, there will be another, more profound, cultural transformation at the epicentre of the world's sole superpower. Gore has the reputation of making key decisions on his own. To know him is to know who is going to be behind the wheel.</p> <p>Bush is an entirely different kind of operator. He keeps normal business hours, and expects his team to agree on a policy decision and present it to him in digestible form, rather like Ronald Reagan. So, as with Reagan, the identity of those advisers will take on a particular significance for the US and the world should America swing right today.</p> <p>They are, to say the least, a pretty interesting bunch - a different tribe entirely from the slick, pragmatic New Democrats in power at the moment. They have more in common with the Reaganauts than the subsequent court run by Bush the Elder.</p> <p>Bush's key economic adviser is Larry Lindsey, an early adherent from the Reagan era of supply-side economics. The doctrine (famously derided as \"voodoo economics\" by the governor's dad), provides an academic rationale for giving tax cuts to the rich. The theory is that rich people would invest their windfall in the stock market, providing a morale-boosting injection of funds and investment capital to create jobs, providing \"trickle-down\" wealth to the ordinary people. The supply-siders thus provide a do-gooder gloss to the Bush tax-cut plan, which would hand $81bn (60% of the total reduction) to the richest 13m taxpayers.</p> <p>The foreign affairs team also has an 80s feel to it. Condoleeza Rice, the likely national security adviser in the event of a Bush win, worked for the governor's father, but is a child of the cold-war mentality which reigned supreme under Reagan. Together with Paul Wolfowitz (another hard-line Reaganaut and possible defence secretary), she advocates a much tougher, adversarial stance towards Russia and China, and a much more hard-headed assessment of vital national interests, stripped of the humanitarian interventions which have flourished under the Clinton-Gore administration.</p> <p>In terms of economic and foreign policy then, a Bush White House is likely to be merely a throwback.

      "bodyText": "The world's most powerful capital is today holding its breath, waiting to discover who its new tenants will be. If Al Gore pulls off a miracle it will presumably be business as usual - more or less the same breed of earnest young Democrats that has been filling the Starbucks branches on Pennsylvania Avenue for the past eight years. If George W Bush triumphs, however, Washington will have to brace itself for a cultural tidal wave rolling in from Texas. If elected, the governor from Austin would inevitably bring a new crowd of advisers, wonks, gurus and hangers-on from the governor's mansion in Austin. There will be many immediate changes. Overnight, cowboy boots will become de rigueur with business suits, and the Texas twang (in both its authentic and ersatz varieties) will reverberate around the cafes of Georgetown. But beneath the froth, there will be another, more profound, cultural transformation at the epicentre of the world's sole superpower. Gore has the reputation of making key decisions on his own. To know him is to know who is going to be behind the wheel. Bush is an entirely different kind of operator. He keeps normal business hours, and expects his team to agree on a policy decision and present it to him in digestible form, rather like Ronald Reagan. So, as with Reagan, the identity of those advisers will take on a particular significance for the US and the world should America swing right today. They are, to say the least, a pretty interesting bunch - a different tribe entirely from the slick, pragmatic New Democrats in power at the moment. They have more in common with the Reaganauts than the subsequent court run by Bush the Elder. Bush's key economic adviser is Larry Lindsey, an early adherent from the Reagan era of supply-side economics. The doctrine (famously derided as \"voodoo economics\" by the governor's dad), provides an academic rationale for giving tax cuts to the rich. The theory is that rich people would invest their windfall in the stock market, providing a morale-boosting injection of funds and investment capital to create jobs, providing \"trickle-down\" wealth to the ordinary people. The supply-siders thus provide a do-gooder gloss to the Bush tax-cut plan, which would hand $81bn (60% of the total reduction) to the richest 13m taxpayers. The foreign affairs team also has an 80s feel to it. Condoleeza Rice, the likely national security adviser in the event of a Bush win, worked for the governor's father, but is a child of the cold-war mentality which reigned supreme under Reagan. Together with Paul Wolfowitz (another hard-line Reaganaut and possible defence secretary), she advocates a much tougher, adversarial stance towards Russia and China, and a much more hard-headed assessment of vital national interests, stripped of the humanitarian interventions which have flourished under the Clinton-Gore administration. In terms of economic and foreign policy then, a Bush White House is likely to be merely a throwback. It is the underlying ethos (what the governor would undoubtedly call \"the heart\") of a future Republican administration that would be truly exotic, even bizarre. Bush's favourite slogan \"compassionate conservatism\" is no empty jingle - it is actually borrowed from a body of work by a pair of obscure conservative gurus, whose influence would surely grow exponentially if the Republicans recapture the White House. One is Myron Magnet, a cultural hawk from the right-wing Manhattan Institute. His rival for George W's heart and soul is a Marxist turned born-again Christian from Texas, Marvin Olasky, who believes the whole machinery of state-provided social welfare should be scrapped in favour of a return to 19th-century-style religious charities and soup kitchens. Olasky has come on a long intellectual journey. Born into a Boston Jewish family in 1950, he renounced his religion at the age of 14 and became an avowed atheist. At Yale, he joined the Communist party and in 1972 travelled to Moscow on a Russian freighter, to prove his Marxist-Leninist ardour. His 180-degree transformation came only a year later, apparently as a result of watching a lot of Hollywood westerns. He was doing a graduate degree in American culture at the University of Michigan, focusing on US cinema. He later said that the profound moral sense of right and wrong he found in the western genre, raised in his Marxist mind the nagging question: \"What if there is a God?\" The answer seems to have been not far behind, because Olasky quickly renounced his Communist affiliation, and converted to evangelical Christianity. He now teaches journalism at the University of Texas, but most of his effort is spent in publishing a right-wing Christian conservative journal ambitiously called World (largely devoted to the denunciation of Bill Clinton and all his evils) and running the church he founded in Austin, the Redeemer Presbyterian. The Redeemer church teaches that women have no place in leadership, having already engineered the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. Olasky once said that there was \"a certain shame attached\" to the idea of voting for a woman, because it meant that men had failed in their role. Olasky also believes that liberal journalists have \"holes in their souls\" and practice \"the religion of Zeus\", which came as something of a surprise to the east-coast press. \"What could he mean?\" they wondered.

Olasky's golden age for Christian charitable works was the 1890s, when the grateful poor were ministered to by \"slum angels\" who gave \"gladly\" through \"Jesus's love\".

He would preserve Alaska's Arctic Wildlife Preserve. Bush opposes the Kyoto treaty, would give tax breaks for ethanol use and supports state efforts to reduce pollution from coal-fired power stations. He supports opening the Alaska reserve to oil and gas exploration. Taxes Gore backs tax cuts for middle and lower-income Americans, including an $80bn cut over 10 years for married couples, an increase in earned income tax credit by up to $500 a year for families with more than three children and will provide tax breaks to help fund college education. Bush proposes a $483bn tax-cut package over five years, would simplify the income tax system eliminating one bracket, would cut rates for all Americans, increase child credits, phase out the estate tax. Healthcare Gore would provide health insurance for all children and move slowly towards universal coverage. He would work for a Patient's Bill of Rights, allowing them to sue health organisations, and he would provide a $3,000 tax credit for prescription benefit for the elderly. Bush would reduce the number of uninsured by subsidising their ability to buy private coverage. He would expand medical savings accounts and make the cost of long-term care tax deductible.",

      "bodyText": "The cost of electing George W Bush or Al Gore today as president of the United States comes to a record of almost a third of a billion dollars - and that is without taking into account millions more in \"soft-money\" contributions that are unregulated and hard to track. Mr Bush has raised $187m (\u00a3130m) for his Republican campaign, all but $20m of it spent by a fortnight ago. Mr Gore raised $133m (\u00a392m) for his Democratic campaign, and Ralph Nader of the Green Party raised $6m (\u00a34m), according to the latest official figures. The Republican national commitee has raised another $214m on top of that and the Democrats $179m in unregulated \"soft money\" which was spent across a range of campaigns for president, congressional and local state elections. \"The growing role of money in the political system is a growing problem, yes,\" said Douglas Webber of the non-partisan Centre for Responsive Politics, a research group that monitors contributions to candidates. \"There's just been this constant downpour of money running all over the political process this year. This election will go down as the most expensive by far.\" Mr Gore has said that a campaign finance reform bill will be the first thing he signs if he wins and some senior Republicans have said that they, too, will pursue this matter. The most influential of these is John McCain, Mr Bush's defeated opponent for the Republican nomination to run for the presidency. \"The issue has had enough attention in this campaign that it's safe to assume that there will be some attempt for a change, no matter who wins,\" said Mr Webber. \"Several members of Congress will bring this up.\" Combined spending on the presidential and congressional elections is put at $3bn and on the state contests at another $1bn. Taken together this is an increase of nearly 50% on the 1996 elections in America. Mr Bush raised an unprecedented $100m for his primaries campaign alone; in the much more obscure contest for a New Jersey seat in the US Senate, Jon Corzine, a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has spent $60m of his own money. Congressional candidates are limited to donations of $1m maximum from individuals and $5,000 from political committees. But the rules are side-stepped by setting up \"soft money\" committees. These shell organisations accept funds from corporations, trade unions and the wealthy and spend it on advertising and canvassing on behalf of candidates. Mr Gore and Mr Bush have each accepted $67.6m in public funding, supposedly in return for refraining from raising money for their campaigns. Unrestricted \"soft money\" now exceeds those sums to such an extent that the parties and outside groups can spend more than the candidates. The Republican party spent $36m on television advertising in support of Mr Bush in five months to the end of October compared with $28m spent by the candidate's campaign, says a study by the Brennan Centre at New York University. The Democratic party spent $31m, and oustide groups $9m, on advertisements backing Mr Gore in that period, against his campaign's $21m. \"The outstanding development this cycle is that this is the first election in which non-candidate spending in close races for the House of Representatives, Senate and presidency will exceed spending by the candidates,\" said Michael Malbin of the Campaign Finance Institute. Trevor Potter, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said: \"We haven't seen an election like this since 1972 in terms of the effectively unlimited amounts of money being spent.\" Corporations have been prevented for almost 100 years from making direct political contributions but devices are used to get around the federal spending limits, a development attributed most recently to President Clinton and the Democratic Party. Fred Wertheimer of another monitoring group, Democracy 21, said: \"All the fig leaves have disappeared in this election. There is such a sense now that anything goes that people aren't even looking for cover in terms of massive use of unlimited, unregulated funds. \"If you look at 2000 in comparison with other years, campaign records are being shattered everywhere.

      "bodyText": "Home Office ministers are privately blaming violent story lines in TV programmes, such as The Bill and Crimewatch, for what they say are unjustifiably high fear of crime figures in Britain. The latest fear-of-crime figures in the British Crime Survey show that two thirds of the population believes crime rose between 1997 and 1999. Thirty-three per cent believe crime has risen a lot. Although recorded crime figures have risen, almost entirely due to changes in police counting, figures in the BCS show an overall fall of 10%. Ministers, eager for a change in public perceptions before the general election, are frustrated by the repetitively violent story lines in programmes such as The Bill and the frequent portrayal of the police as corrupt or negligent. They believe it has created an insidious atmosphere and a wholly disproportionate fear of violent crime . Ministers are reluctant to go public about their anger, fearing they will be ridiculed for wanting a return to the era of Dixon of Dock Green, the series in which petty crime was cleared up by placid police officers. In the past, however, ministers have inserted public service messages into some soap operas and they are interested in pressing on programme makers their wider responsibilities. Ministers take the issue seriously since surveys show fear of crime can be almost as debilitating as crime itself. The latest BCS, for instance, shows that 36% of women do not go out at night alone due to fear of crime, while 59% of women aged 60 or over refuse to go out alone. Fear of crime is highest in inner cities, and among ethnic minorities and elderly women. However, the disparity between fear of crime and actual crime is high in rural areas. The 2000 BCS also found that people believe crime has even risen in their own locality with 50% reporting it had risen, and only 14% per cent believing it had fallen. Thirty-three per cent believed it was \"very or fairly likely\" that they would personally suffer crime to their car. Twenty-one per cent expected their home to be burgled, even though figures show only 4.3% of households on current trends will be burgled. In an effort to reassure the public in rural areas, the Home Office minister, Charles Clarke, yesterday urged the police to become more visible in their local communities. He said that police authorities should advertise all that their local units were doing to raise their profile in the local area. Mr Clarke also said he wanted more police to establish a \"local blue light\" through reopening local stations on a part time basis, or by sharing accommodation with other emergency services, or in village halls. He told a rural affairs conference yesterday: \"I believe that every community has the right to information about this work, to offer them the reassurance they seek and to reduce their fears of crime and disorder.\" The government has set a target of cutting fear of crime between 1998 and 2002, but the BCS suggests ministers have made no progress in the first two years in terms of fear of burglary, car theft, or theft from cars - three of the four key indicators set down by the Home Office. The shadow Home Office minister, Ann Widdecombe, told the same conference that fear of crime in the countryside will only be solved by a return to police officers on the rural beat. Miss Widdecombe dismissed a report from the Neighbourhood Watch Association which said bobbies on the beat were a waste of resources, saying they addressed a public need. Drawing on her experience of US policing, Miss Widdecombe called for \"cops in shops\". This would mean giving police temporary bases in shops and local businesses.

Williams, 29, of Bishops Cannings, near Devizes, Wilts, decided to act after becoming incensed by the claims of Michael Glickman, a former professor of architecture who has studied crop circles for many years. He heard Professor Glickman claim on an American radio show that is was impossible for a human to create a seven pointed star shape in a crop field - it could only have been created by aliens.

The UN security council is to consider the demand in a closed session tomorrow, a day before the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, meets President Clinton in Washington. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, will travel to the US on Sunday. Meanwhile the UN said that Israeli helicopters had flown into south Lebanon, a sign of deepening tensions in the region six months after Israeli troops were withdrawn. The Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, said in a statement that two helicopters had landed near a village. He regarded it as \"an act of war\". President Clinton is hoping to use his separate meetings with Mr Barak and Mr Arafat to stabilise the fragile ceasefire achieved last week in an extraordinary return to the frontline of Israeli diplomacy by the elder statesman Shimon Peres. However, the Palestinians are resisting Mr Clinton's efforts to corral Mr Arafat in the negotiating framework whose collapse has led to 180 deaths and thousands hurt during more than five weeks of violence. Yesterday a Palestinian teenager was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Tulkarm. Another man died under Israeli gunfire at a flashpoint in Gaza, where a teenager was blinded in both eyes after being shot in the head, doctors in Gaza City said. With Palestinian casualties continuing to rise, Mr Arafat is renewing his demand for a 2,000-strong observer force in the West Bank and Gaza, which would be the first step in breaking Washington's monopoly on Middle East peacemaking. There has been a small unarmed force of 120 international observers in the West Bank city of Hebron for six years, since the 1994 massacre of more than two dozen Palestinians by a Jewish settler. \"I am asking for quick international forces to protect us, to stop this war, the massacres against our people,\" Mr Arafat told CBS television on Sunday night. \"I am asking the American people, I am asking the whole international community to save the peace process.\" That demand was amplified yesterday by Mr Arafat's aides, who said he would discuss an international force in his talks with President Clinton. \"We are in need of more than guarantees. We need to have an international force to replace Israeli occupation troops,\" one of Mr Arafat's spokesmen, Nabil Abu Rudeinah, said. The push for an international observer force is part of a greater Palestinian effort to secure UN and European involvement in the peace process. \"The rules of management for all previous negotiations are no longer valid,\" the speaker of the Palesinian parliament, Ahmed Qureia, said. \"There should be a new way for negotiations. There should be other international powers besides the US. I think the European Union, Russia, China and the United Nations should be involved to help the partners reach an agreement.\" Palestinian analysts argue that the seeds of the present crisis were sown at the Camp David summit in July, and during seven years of negotiations in which Israel failed to honour commitments to withdraw from territory in the West Bank and release Palestinian prisoners. The visit of the hawkish Likud party leader Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's holiest Muslim site on September 28 merely served to ignite long-smouldering frustrations. \"I think the intifada started at Camp David in a way, because the intifada is a specific expression of the basic crisis and confrontation in the peace process,\" said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst. But the very prospect of international involvement in its conflict with the Palestinians - let alone a 2,000-strong observer force - is anathema to Israel. \"Any international presence will become a reward for Palestinian violence,\" Mr Barak said yesterday. US diplomats said the Israeli opposition to the idea articulated by Mr Barak, Shimon Peres, and the foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami made it a non-starter for Washington. \"I think it is important to stop this, because if there is more than one mediator we will discover that we are mediating each other rather than mediating the conflict,\" Mr Peres told the Guardian.

The select committee on modernisation of the Commons found that the experiment to run from 11.30am to 7pm on Thursdays had been a success even though some complained that Westminster was like a morgue on Thursday evenings. Bad Day William Hague: The Tory leader suffered badly in a survey to find the country's sexiest politician, with 2% of women and 2% of men voting for him. Top of the survey of 500 people for a sex festival at Olympia, London, was Tony Blair with 16% of women and 10% of men. Rebuttal of the day Yesterday's Media Guardian caused a stir in the house with ministers forced to answer claims that \"bullying tactics\" were being used to set the news agenda. Culture minister Janet Anderson insisted the government did not think it had a remit to \"dictate to broadcasters\" the contents of their news bulletins. Today Commons: Questions to foreign secretary Robin Cook. Motion on modernisation of house. Lords: Countryside and rights of way bill, report. Energy Act 1976 (reserve powers) order 2000.",

      "body": "<p>It is becoming less and less likely the government's public-private partnership (PPP) to improve and expand London's tube will see the light of day.</p> <p>Here comes Bob Kiley from New York as transport commissioner and with him a chance to resolve the funding question once for all. He demonstrated that investment in a municipally owned urban railway can be secured and he knows how to do it. Mr Kiley, in London yesterday full of doubts about the government scheme, starts full-time in January.</p> <p>The PPP proposed three separate 30-year contracts with private companies which would do track and signalling plus a fourth public company running trains. Even before the Hatfield crash it was unpopular and poorly understood.</p> <p>The crash eroded confidence in the ability of a private company to manage a railway. The inquiries into Paddington and other accidents may or may not conclude that privatisation was a factor but the general public will see PPP as more of the \"fragmentation\" that ministers have themselves condemned. It is also inconsistent to devolve power to a London authority, then expect the mayor and commissioner to be responsible for deals negotiated for them by Whitehall.</p> <p>In any case, the sheer complexity of negotiations make it uncertain the PPP deal will be completed by the latest target date - April 2001, already a year late. Labour faces the prospect of an election campaign without having achieved any of its 1987 objectives for the tube, whilst incurring vast expense on consultants.</p> <p>There are two alternatives to PPP. One is to simply keep the tube under the direct control of central government. This could have been accepted without more ado from the beginning. A much more sensible alternative would be to pass it to the mayor and leave him to decide how to pay for investment. Mr Kiley's proven experience teamed with Mr Livingstone's strong electoral mandate should be quite a force.</p> <p>But how to pay? Some new method needs to be found and while the American experience of using revenue bonds is useful, there is work to be done to establish such a scheme in the UK.</p> <p>The ball has to land in the Greater London Authority's court. Contrary to popular belief, the PPP relates only to the underground as it is and the GLA will have to find ways to finance any new tube lines. Second, the mayor is committed to introducing congestion charging. This will make much more sense as part of transport strategy if part of the revenue can be capitalised to finance trains and buses.</p> <p>A \"plan B\" is going to be needed anyway. The government can proceed with the PPP only if the independent health and safety executive says it is safe and the national audit office certifies it gives value for money. The absence of either could stop the PPP and it would be intolerable to suffer further delay.</p> <p>A different approach would involve issuing bonds under the GLA's auspices. Two types are possible: government-guaranteed bonds (such as those for the Channel tunnel rail link) or \"revenue bonds\", backed by dedicated revenues, without government guarantee. The Americans use a \"public benefit corporation\" through which government retains control but management and finance are done separately. New York's metropolitan transportation authority is an example.</p> <p>Here trusts were common in the 18th century as a means of funding and procuring local services - they were the very beginnings of local government.

      "bodyText": "It is becoming less and less likely the government's public-private partnership (PPP) to improve and expand London's tube will see the light of day. Here comes Bob Kiley from New York as transport commissioner and with him a chance to resolve the funding question once for all. He demonstrated that investment in a municipally owned urban railway can be secured and he knows how to do it. Mr Kiley, in London yesterday full of doubts about the government scheme, starts full-time in January. The PPP proposed three separate 30-year contracts with private companies which would do track and signalling plus a fourth public company running trains. Even before the Hatfield crash it was unpopular and poorly understood. The crash eroded confidence in the ability of a private company to manage a railway. The inquiries into Paddington and other accidents may or may not conclude that privatisation was a factor but the general public will see PPP as more of the \"fragmentation\" that ministers have themselves condemned. It is also inconsistent to devolve power to a London authority, then expect the mayor and commissioner to be responsible for deals negotiated for them by Whitehall. In any case, the sheer complexity of negotiations make it uncertain the PPP deal will be completed by the latest target date - April 2001, already a year late. Labour faces the prospect of an election campaign without having achieved any of its 1987 objectives for the tube, whilst incurring vast expense on consultants. There are two alternatives to PPP. One is to simply keep the tube under the direct control of central government. This could have been accepted without more ado from the beginning. A much more sensible alternative would be to pass it to the mayor and leave him to decide how to pay for investment. Mr Kiley's proven experience teamed with Mr Livingstone's strong electoral mandate should be quite a force. But how to pay? Some new method needs to be found and while the American experience of using revenue bonds is useful, there is work to be done to establish such a scheme in the UK. The ball has to land in the Greater London Authority's court. Contrary to popular belief, the PPP relates only to the underground as it is and the GLA will have to find ways to finance any new tube lines. Second, the mayor is committed to introducing congestion charging. This will make much more sense as part of transport strategy if part of the revenue can be capitalised to finance trains and buses. A \"plan B\" is going to be needed anyway. The government can proceed with the PPP only if the independent health and safety executive says it is safe and the national audit office certifies it gives value for money. The absence of either could stop the PPP and it would be intolerable to suffer further delay. A different approach would involve issuing bonds under the GLA's auspices. Two types are possible: government-guaranteed bonds (such as those for the Channel tunnel rail link) or \"revenue bonds\", backed by dedicated revenues, without government guarantee. The Americans use a \"public benefit corporation\" through which government retains control but management and finance are done separately. New York's metropolitan transportation authority is an example. Here trusts were common in the 18th century as a means of funding and procuring local services - they were the very beginnings of local government. The port of London authority was created in 1908 as a public trust agency with the capacity to issue its own bonds, secured by port revenues. It still exists. The London passenger transport board, existed as a trust from 1933 to 1948, with Treasury authority to issue bonds for capital investment. For argument's sake, if a London body issued bonds for a term of 30 years paying 7.5% a year, London Underground's operating surplus of \u00a3250m a year could support a bond issue of approximately \u00a33bn. Every \u00a3100m a year of added cash would support bonds worth \u00a31.2bn. That added cash could be government grant (which would be forthcoming in any case under the PPP) or special fees or levies. This type of financing structure could accommodate other kinds of capital spending as London's local government develops. The chart shows how income from fares generates a surplus over running costs, but not enough to pay for needed investment. The counter argument is that bonds would leave London Transport's poor-quality management intact. But Mr Kiley will expect to seek efficiencies and it would be perfectly possible for bond issues to be invested in pro jects where private firms are brought in to manage projects or goods and services procured using the best business practice. The point is that there are precedents for almost any financing structure. One of the advantages of the way we are governed is that almost anything can be created - though enabling legislation might be required. It is a matter of government deciding how, realistically, it wishes to achieve its ends. When that is done, Treasury rules and local government financing restrictions can be varied to accommodate the policy, as has happened often enough in the past.

He was reported to have left the Khost camp an hour before the strike. The hardline Islamic Taliban regime has repeatedly refused to hand him over, despite UN sanctions imposed a year ago and a $5m reward offered by the US for information leading to his capture. Such is the sensitivity regarding Mr Bin Laden's whereabouts that the vehicle of a UN team inspecting aid projects close to the Kandahar base was recently forced off the road by three Land Cruisers packed with his men. Two UN officials were taken at gunpoint to the residence of Kandahar's Taliban governor to explain themselves. They were released after admitting that they had made a mistake, UN sources reported. Mullah Omar has also stepped up his personal security since a bomb attack last year which appears to have been more devastating than originally thought. As many as 50 people, including members of his family, may have died when a truck parked outside his house exploded. The toll was originally put at 10. Mullah Omar has now moved to a more secure house in Kandahar, allegedly paid for by Mr Bin Laden.",

Although much of what the airline announced yesterday had been started by the deposed Bob Ayling earlier this year - a point which Mr Eddington recognises - the root and branch examination of BA's operation is Mr Eddington' s initiative alone. </p> <p>The personable Australian has spent the past six months carefully studying the company's structure. Both the frills and the no frills are out, starting with Go, BA's low-cost carrier, which will be sold off to the highest bidder as soon as possible. The frills are the extras that BA has acquired over the past few years, appendages that are unprofitable and have diverted the airline from what it once did best: providing an excellent service at top of the market prices. </p> <p>So it is back to BA's core business for Mr Eddington, and those passengers at the rear of the aircraft will just have to live with the cramped conditions. They have their place on long-haul trips, of course, but the burgeoning business of the low-cost carriers will take care of them. Witness Luton and Stansted early in the morning. </p> <p>Still, it is a high-risk policy to tempt premium passengers with the promise of more frequent flights in flat beds in and out of Heathrow, even though the numbers are beginning to stack up. </p> <p>If Mr Eddington can win back BA's tarnished reputation as an airline that puts customer care first, he will win new friends. And if he can do it without firing staff, he will do much to restore staff morale. Under the Ayling regime it suffered badly. </p> <p>However, the hurdle of what to do with Gatwick remains, as does the long-term position of the airline which is in danger of being throttled because it cannot expand out of Heathrow. </p> <p><strong> BBC rethink </strong><br> </p> <p>Ah! So you have arrived here on Page 29, half way between an obit of Jimmie Davis and the Derby/West Ham fixture. These are the financial pages. Either you are on a very long train journey or you have an interest in the world of business and economics. </p> <p>The BBC has been serving you badly. You probably already know that, having sat from time to time through a 20-minute dissection of Serbo-Croat politics by Mark Urban, only to watch Peter Jay trying to explain why interest rates have gone up with the aid of some toy-town graphics, all in the space of two minutes, twenty seconds. </p> <p>Greg Dyke, the BBC's director general, issued you all an apology yesterday. While speaking at the Confederation of British Industry conference in Birmingham, he promised lots more resources to both expand business coverage and modernise editorial thinking on business stories across the corporation's flagship news programmes. </p> <p>Implementer-in-chief will be Jeff Randall, the current editor of Sunday Business, who is moving to the newly created position of BBC business editor. </p> <p>Mr Randall is a business journalist of substantial swagger (not to mention sway in the Savoy Grill Room). He will find willing journalistic talent in corners such as the Financial World Tonight or the professionally turned Business section of BBC Online. All the same, nudging other parts of the corporation away from the assumption that all bosses are greedy men who just enjoy sacking people will take time. </p> <p>For what it is worth, Mr Randall's favourite line to fire at one-paced reporters is \"get an alarm clock\". But John Humphries and his colleagues on the Today programme might already have an answer to that one. </p> <p><strong> Snookered? </strong><br> </p> <p>Hans Snook, chief executive Orange, said yesterday that we will have to wait another month before we know whether he is retaining a senior executive role at the mobile phone business once the new owners, France Telecom, refloat it early next year. </p> <p>His comments follow the unexpected move by the French last month to install a new chief executive (Jean-Francois Pontal) at Orange and then, more recently, news that the business will have its primary share listing in Paris rather than London - fuelling further speculation on Mr Snook's future. </p> <p>Whatever France Telecom's advisers say, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the man is being edged out of a business which has been largely built in his idiosyncratic image. </p> <p>Orange has been padded out with France Telecom's existing mobile phone interests and the assumption is that the top man, Michel Bon, did not want someone like Mr Snook throwing their weight around. </p> <p>This is a shame, since the world of mobile telephony will be a less colourful place without him. But the man knows about brands and how to build them. The scores of millions Mr Snook has made at Orange will probably pale into insignificance at his next venture.</p>",

If Mr Eddington can win back BA's tarnished reputation as an airline that puts customer care first, he will win new friends. And if he can do it without firing staff, he will do much to restore staff morale. Under the Ayling regime it suffered badly. However, the hurdle of what to do with Gatwick remains, as does the long-term position of the airline which is in danger of being throttled because it cannot expand out of Heathrow. BBC rethink Ah! So you have arrived here on Page 29, half way between an obit of Jimmie Davis and the Derby/West Ham fixture. These are the financial pages. Either you are on a very long train journey or you have an interest in the world of business and economics. The BBC has been serving you badly. You probably already know that, having sat from time to time through a 20-minute dissection of Serbo-Croat politics by Mark Urban, only to watch Peter Jay trying to explain why interest rates have gone up with the aid of some toy-town graphics, all in the space of two minutes, twenty seconds. Greg Dyke, the BBC's director general, issued you all an apology yesterday. While speaking at the Confederation of British Industry conference in Birmingham, he promised lots more resources to both expand business coverage and modernise editorial thinking on business stories across the corporation's flagship news programmes. Implementer-in-chief will be Jeff Randall, the current editor of Sunday Business, who is moving to the newly created position of BBC business editor. Mr Randall is a business journalist of substantial swagger (not to mention sway in the Savoy Grill Room). He will find willing journalistic talent in corners such as the Financial World Tonight or the professionally turned Business section of BBC Online. All the same, nudging other parts of the corporation away from the assumption that all bosses are greedy men who just enjoy sacking people will take time. For what it is worth, Mr Randall's favourite line to fire at one-paced reporters is \"get an alarm clock\". But John Humphries and his colleagues on the Today programme might already have an answer to that one. Snookered? Hans Snook, chief executive Orange, said yesterday that we will have to wait another month before we know whether he is retaining a senior executive role at the mobile phone business once the new owners, France Telecom, refloat it early next year. His comments follow the unexpected move by the French last month to install a new chief executive (Jean-Francois Pontal) at Orange and then, more recently, news that the business will have its primary share listing in Paris rather than London - fuelling further speculation on Mr Snook's future. Whatever France Telecom's advisers say, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the man is being edged out of a business which has been largely built in his idiosyncratic image. Orange has been padded out with France Telecom's existing mobile phone interests and the assumption is that the top man, Michel Bon, did not want someone like Mr Snook throwing their weight around. This is a shame, since the world of mobile telephony will be a less colourful place without him. But the man knows about brands and how to build them. The scores of millions Mr Snook has made at Orange will probably pale into insignificance at his next venture.",

      "body": "<p>Over the past 10 days, liberals have been voicing shock and dismay at the imminent prospect of their old hero, Ralph Nader, intentionally throwing the election to George W Bush. A first, eloquent protest came 10 days ago from a group of a dozen former \"Nader's Raiders,\" who asserted that their former mentor had broken a promise not to campaign in states where he could hurt Gore and begged him to reconsider doing so. Others, including Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter, have expressed a similar sense of disappointment and betrayal.</p> <p>Nader's response to all this heartfelt hand-wringing has been to scoff and sneer. On Good Morning America, he referred contemptuously to his old disciples as \"frightened liberals\". The Green party nominee is spending the final week of the campaign stumping in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington - the very states where a strong showing stands to hurt Gore the most.</p> <p>Nader has said he wants to maximise his vote in every state in hopes of attaining the 5% of the vote that will qualify the Green party for $12m in federal matching funds in 2004. Speaking to foreign journalists in Washington yesterday, he explicitly rejected internet vote-swapping schemes that could help him reach this qualifying threshold without the side-effect of electing Bush president. In various other TV appearances, Nader has stated bluntly that he couldn't care less who wins.</p> <p>This depraved indifference to Republican rule has made Nader's old liberal friends even more furious. A bunch of intellectuals organised by Sean Wilentz and Todd Gitlin are circulating a much nastier open letter, denouncing Nader's \"wrecking-ball campaign - one that betrays the very liberal and progressive values it claims to uphold\".</p> <p>But really, the question shouldn't be the one liberals seem to be asking about why Nader is doing what he's doing. The question should be why anyone is surprised. For some time now, Nader has made it perfectly clear that his campaign isn't about trying to pull the Democrats back to the left. Rather, his strategy is the Leninist one of \"heightening the contradictions\". It's not just that Nader is willing to take a chance of being personally responsible for electing Bush. It's that he's actively trying to elect Bush because he thinks that social conditions in American need to get worse before they can better.</p> <p>Nader often makes this \"the worse, the better\" point on the stump in relation to Republicans and the environment. He says that the Reagan-era interior secretary James Watt was useful because he was a \"provocateur\" for change, noting that Watt spurred a massive boost in the Sierra Club's membership. More recently, Nader applied the same logic to Bush himself. Here's the Los Angeles Times' account of a speech Nader gave at Chapman University in Orange, California, last week: \"After lambasting Gore as part of a do-nothing Clinton administration, Nader said, 'If it were a choice between a provocateur and an anaesthetiser, I'd rather have a provocateur. It would mobilise us.' \"</p> <p>Lest this remark be considered an aberration, Nader has said similar things before. \"When [the Democrats] lose, they say it's because they are not appealing to the Republican voters,\" Nader told an audience in Madison, Wisconsin, a few months ago, according to a story in the Nation. \"We want them to say they lost because a progressive movement took away votes.\"</p> <p>That might make it sound like Nader's goal is to defeat Gore in order to shift the Democratic party to the left. But in a more recent interview with David Moberg in the socialist paper In These Times, Nader made it clear that his real mission is to destroy and then replace the Democratic party altogether. According to Moberg, Nader talked \"about leading the Greens into a 'death struggle' with the Democratic party to determine which will be the majority party\". Nader further and shockingly explained that he hopes in the future to run Green party candidates around the country, including against such progressive Democrats as Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, and Representative Henry Waxman of California. \"I hate to use military analogies,\" Nader said, \"but this is war on the two parties.\"</p> <p>Hitler analogies always lead to trouble, but the one here is irresistible since Nader is actually making the argument of the German Communist party circa 1932, which helped bring the Nazis to power. I'm not comparing the Republicans to fascists or the Greens to Stalinists for that matter. But Nader and his supporters are emulating a disturbing, familiar pattern of sectarian idiocy.</p> <p>You hear these echoes whenever Nader criticises Bush half-heartedly, then becomes enthusiastic and animated blasting the Green version of the \"social fascists\" - Bill Clinton, Gore, and moderate environmentalists. It's clear that the people he really despises are those who half agree with him.</p> <p>To Nader, it is liberal meliorists, not rightwing conservatives, who are the true enemies of his effort to build a \"genuine\" progressive movement. He does have a preference between Republicans and Democrats, and it's for the party that he thinks will inflict maximum damage on the environment, civil rights, labour rights, and so on. By assisting his class enemy, Nader thinks he can help pull the wool from the eyes of a sheep-like public.</p> <p>If Nader's goal were actually progressive reform - a ban on soft money, a higher minimum wage, health-care coverage for some of the uninsured, a global warming treaty - it would be possible to say that his strategy was breathtakingly stupid. But Nader's goal is not progressive reform; it's a transformation in human consciousness. His Green party will not flourish under Democratic presidents who lull the country into a sense of complacency by making things moderately better. If it is to thrive, it needs villainous, rightwing Republicans who will make things worse.</p> <p>Like Pat Buchanan, Nader understands that his movement thrives on misery. But the comparison is actually unfair to Buchanan (words I never thought I'd write) because Buchanan doesn't work to create more misery for the sake of making his movement grow the way Nader does. From a strictly self-interested point of view, Nader's stance is the more rational one.</p> <p>So Gore supporters might as well quit warning the Green candidate that he's going to put George W Bush in White House. Ralph Nader is a very intelligent man who knows exactly what's he doing. And they only seem to be encouraging him.</p> <p>This has been extracted from Slate magazine <a href=\"http://www.slate.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.slate.com</a></p>",

You hear these echoes whenever Nader criticises Bush half-heartedly, then becomes enthusiastic and animated blasting the Green version of the \"social fascists\" - Bill Clinton, Gore, and moderate environmentalists. It's clear that the people he really despises are those who half agree with him. To Nader, it is liberal meliorists, not rightwing conservatives, who are the true enemies of his effort to build a \"genuine\" progressive movement. He does have a preference between Republicans and Democrats, and it's for the party that he thinks will inflict maximum damage on the environment, civil rights, labour rights, and so on. By assisting his class enemy, Nader thinks he can help pull the wool from the eyes of a sheep-like public. If Nader's goal were actually progressive reform - a ban on soft money, a higher minimum wage, health-care coverage for some of the uninsured, a global warming treaty - it would be possible to say that his strategy was breathtakingly stupid. But Nader's goal is not progressive reform; it's a transformation in human consciousness. His Green party will not flourish under Democratic presidents who lull the country into a sense of complacency by making things moderately better. If it is to thrive, it needs villainous, rightwing Republicans who will make things worse. Like Pat Buchanan, Nader understands that his movement thrives on misery. But the comparison is actually unfair to Buchanan (words I never thought I'd write) because Buchanan doesn't work to create more misery for the sake of making his movement grow the way Nader does. From a strictly self-interested point of view, Nader's stance is the more rational one. So Gore supporters might as well quit warning the Green candidate that he's going to put George W Bush in White House. Ralph Nader is a very intelligent man who knows exactly what's he doing. And they only seem to be encouraging him. This has been extracted from Slate magazine www.slate.com",

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, I was working with Paula Yates on the publicity for her novel, and had booked her on a chat show in Dublin. Afterwards, we went clubbing with the other guests, Lennox Lewis and fashion designer John Rocha. While Lewis's entourage cruised the club in search of women, he and Paula sat on a sofa having a natter. After an hour, she headed back to the hotel to be with her kids. \"Lennox is very sweet but I think he's a bit inexperienced with women,\" she told me the next day. That really summed Paula up. She wanted to be fantastically glamorous, but what she really loved was an intimate chat before heading to bed with a cup of cocoa. </p> <p>When Princess Diana met Paula before Michael Hutchence died, she thanked the presenter for sharing the duty of keeping the tabloids sated. For the most photographed woman in the world, who could spark a debate on cellulite from a car-seat imprint on her thigh, the presence of another blonde who gave good headline was a welcome respite. And, of course, Paula's public response to any tabloid abuse was newsworthy in itself: she would strut through Heathrow wearing a skimpy \"Little Miss Naughty\" T-shirt. </p> <p>The Diana anecdote, told by Michael Hutchence's brother Rhett, appears in The Real Paula Yates, tonight's Channel 4 documentary, which has been hastily - but tastefully - put together in the wake of her death. Channel 4 was, in many ways, Paula's natural home, from her Pretty in Punk days at The Tube to her bedroom antics on The Big Breakfast. Clips of her interviewing Hutchence on both shows, several years apart, sizzle with sexual tension. </p> <p>The programme covers a lot of familiar ground: her isolated childhood; the jelly and ice-cream party she wanted her own family life to be; the career that paved the way for female presenters; and her comet-blaze of passion for Hutchence, the Heathcliffe to her Cathy. It has an impressive roster of contributors who genuinely knew her sharing their insights and memories, including her friend Brenda Brewin's summation that Paula \"wanted to be somewhere between Marilyn Monroe and Mary Poppins\". </p> <p>Among the TV clips is the first edition of The Tube, when Paula, sprightly in a fairy ball-gown of candy-pink tulle, cheerfully confesses that her stomach will be growing week by week. The Tube's producers had wanted a wild child presenter for their anarchic new show; instead they got one with child. And this was a decade and a half before the Pregnant Spices and Zo\u00eb Ball could Carry On Up The Duff without raising the collective public's eyebrow. </p> <p>I was glad to find something to smile about in many of the clips and anecdotes, because the Paula Yates I worked with was fun. She would dash out of her stint at The Big Breakfast looking like a Barbie punk princess in a lacy designer dress with balcony-cleavage that needed more flesh-coloured undergarments than a village hall production of Hair. There is nothing quite like a publicity book tour to bring a celebrity down to earth, but Paula kept her sense of humour throughout, even when her interview on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour was preceded by an item on constipation that was as painfully long as the affliction itself. </p> <p>\"Flirting is the very essence of my being\", was Paula's tongue-in-cheek answer for one magazine questionnaire. \"She was great at flirting and keeping it at that,\" Simon Le Bon explains in the documentary. But she also loved a girly giggle with other women. She called me \"the lissom Michelle\" and pinched my bum when I wasn't looking. We discussed make-up, underwear, families, life in general and - once - drugs. She told me she had heard that Hutchence took drugs and didn't I think drug users were unsavoury, all that lying in the gutter and dribbling at the mouth? Then she gave that lupine grin. </p> <p>The literary dinners she attended were the first time she spent nights away from her girls, and she would dive into toyshops to stock up on fairy outfits to take back for them. It was only after she started seeing Hutchence that the drug rumours began. It was a far cry from the home-loving, clean-living Paula of old. </p> <p>The documentary contains some poignant images of Tiger Lily, a \"bonsai Michael\" as Paula described her, clinging to her mother's torso at her father's funeral like a wide-eyed koala cub. I was reminded of Frances Bean after Kurt Cobain's death three years earlier, same eyes, same grip. The all-too-frequent cry nowadays of \"What about the children?\" - the innocent casualties of celebrity crash and burn - is put into context by Chris Hill from Ensign Records. \"If she'd stayed clean when Michael had gone... she would have got on with her life, because the kids meant that much to her... [the drink and the drugs] made the kids secondary.\" It's no excuse, as they say, but it's a reason. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Brenda Brewin gives evidence that Paula was starting to pull herself out of the domino effect of the tragedies that had blighted the final three years of her life. Her last summer was spent in Hastings where she was planning to move into a house by the sea. Paula once told me how much she envied people who had the courage to give everything up for a more peaceful way of life. Perhaps she is walking along that beach now, barefoot, her sparkling evening gown skimming the sands. </p> <p>\u0095 The Real Paula Yates, tonight, 9.30pm, C4</p>",

Nicole Lavelle, 16, told Stirling sheriff court that her father, Callum, was happy to pay \u00a312,000 a year for her to attend an exclusive school of his choosing, but withdrew his support when she decided to go to a cheaper school closer to her mother's home. Miss Lavelle said that her father, who lives in Dunblane, near Stirling, told her that she must decide between a relationship with him and a relationship with her mother. As she took the stand, dressed in her navy school uniform, Miss Lavelle said she had tried to find equal ground between her parents when they divorced in 1998. But she could think of no other reason for her father's actions than the feud between her parents. She is suing Mr Lavelle for the \u00a36,600 a year she needs to continue her education at King's School, Worcester. If Miss Lavelle is successful, she will become the first child in Scotland to use the \"right to aliment\", which is contained in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985, to force a parent to pay private school fees. The court heard that when Miss Lavelle's parents split up she decided to stay in Scotland with her father, a computer executive in Stirling. Initially the pair lived together in a rented flat. But the pressures of Mr Lavelle's job made him decide to send his daughter away to school. \"My dad said I had to go to a boarding school because he worked abroad a lot and there would be nobody at home,\" she told the court. \"He said it was in everybody's best interests.\" While her father stayed in Dunblane and remarried, Miss Lavelle studied at Harrogate Ladies' College, North Yorkshire.

She told the court that she planned to spend weekends with her mother and sister in Peopleton, near Worcester, and longer breaks with her father. The court heard that her father was amenable to this, but then he visited her at Harrogate and told her he had changed his mind.

      "body": "<p>Nicolas Poussin and Sandro Botticelli were painters of myth, who pictured the gods and demigods of ancient Greece and Rome as immediately as if they had been born 2,000 years ago in the fields of Campania, worshipping Bacchus. Poussin was obsessed with Rome. Born in Normandy in 1594, he tried and failed twice to travel to the city before he finally secured the patronage to live there. Poussin was an artist of ruins, decline and melancholy. His classical world is perfect but doomed. \"Et in Arcadia ego,\" says the writing on the tomb discovered by the shepherds in his most famous painting: \"I too was in Arcadia.\" </p> <p>The 15th-century artist Botticelli only came to Rome because the Pope invited him to paint part of the Sistine Chapel. According to Vasari in The Lives of the Painters, the great city was too much for him; he spent all his money and went home to Florence with his tail between his legs. Botticelli's ancient world is defined by sharp lines, sensual bodies and the lucidity of dreams. In The Calumny of Apelles (c.1494), based on ancient descriptions of a lost masterpiece by the painter Apelles, Botticelli stages the action against classical architecture, a monumental setting in which statues seem alive and living people frozen like statues. </p> <p>Poussin and Botticelli were painters of myth yet both, according to two major exhibitions in Rome, were orthodox Christians, good Catholics all along. This year is Rome's Great Jubilee 2000, a massive celebration declared by the Vatican that has drawn pilgrims to the city from all over the world. Buildings have been cleaned and restored, churches opened at more congenial hours; the eternal city looks more eternal than ever - and there are some stupendous art exhibitions. </p> <p>The French Academy, which occupies the Villa Medici on the Pincio hill at the top of the Spanish Steps, has The Hidden God, co-curated by Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery in London. MacGregor recently presented the TV series Seeing Salvation, which accompanied a show at the National Gallery, and The Hidden God continues his argument that at the core of great European painting is Christianity. Here he focuses on French classicism in the first half of the 17th century, the age of Poussin, the period of a supremely intellectual art - manifesting itself also in the drama of Racine and Corneille - that replaces the sensuousness of Italian Renaissance painting with a self-consciously distanced, historically grand aesthetic. </p> <p>According to The Hidden God, the art of Poussin and his contemporaries - painters such as Philippe de Champaigne, Charles Le Brun, Simon Vouet and Jacques Stella - is profoundly religious. Yet it is also about myth. French classicism is a deeply melancholy art that acknowledges its own inability to do what painting dreams of doing: to set an absent scene before us. When Italian painters in the early 17th century wanted to paint Christian stories, they went to extremes to make the Bible real. </p> <p>Down the hill from the Villa Medici you can step into the church of Santa Maria del Popolo, where Caravaggio's The Crucifixion of St Peter has three men struggling with the weight of St Peter as they try to erect the cross upside-down to which he is nailed. This painting tries to make the martyrdom immediate, as if we were there; the French religious paintings MacGregor and his co-curator Olivier Bonfait have collected do the opposite. They seem to delight in the remoteness of the Christian story, holding it up for scrutiny and, in the case of Poussin, to an analysis of mythic narrative. </p> <p>Poussin's Annunciation (1657) states explicitly that this is a painting - not the real thing, but an attempt to visualise a written narrative in the Bible. Poussin designed his paintings using a kind of toy theatre in which he arranged little clay figures. This painting bears the traces of that theatre; it is consciously stagey. Mary and the angel are posed on a raised stone stage. Below Mary is a plaque fixed to the stone pedestal on which she sits declaring \"Poussin faciebat\", Poussin made it, and giving the date. Poussin made this; it is not an image directly inspired by God. The kinds of theology popular in elevated circles in 17th-century France made space for doubt, for a faith won intellectually rather than emotionally. </p> <p>The Hidden God is a quotation from Pascal, who described painting as a secondary reality that cannot approach the true divine reality and is condemned to be a mourning for what is absent. This mourning is explicit in Poussin's Lamentation, on loan from the National Gallery of Ireland, in which stately robed figures weep over the grey, lifeless body of Christ. To the right is a classical tomb with a black doorway to death; in the distance are the walls of a city. This painting takes us to the still, tragic centre of Poussin's art. He is a tragedian; but is he also a theologian? When a man in an otherwise supremely calm landscape is poisoned and dies in the National Gallery's Landscape with a Man Killed by a Snake, are we really looking at a Christian allegory? </p> <p> That's what this exhibition suggests. But you can also see Poussin's religious paintings as essays in the power of myth. Poussin was a student of antiquity - he goes to enormous lengths to set his paintings in archaeologically accurate versions of the ancient world - and you can see him as an anthropologist, exploring the meanings of myths in Ovid and in Bible stories alike. In his painting The Abandonment of Moses, he seems most interested in the antiquarian details of the setting: the Sphinx, a pyramid, an obelisk. Poussin concocts a rich blend of Christian and pagan melancholy, a gloomy dance to the music of time. He is a genius of atmosphere. Poussin's paintings juxtapose planes of colour, receding into a distant landscape. </p> <p>Botticelli is much sharper, more resolved. He defines everything with clear lines and firm perspective: the perfect Florentine Renaissance artist. Pallas and the Centaur stand there before you in the exhibition Sandro Botticelli: Painter of the Divine Comedy on the Quirinale hill. Botticelli does not paint myth at one remove, as a narrative ruin. He puts flesh on the story. Pallas Athena, goddess of wisdom, swathed in laurels and armed with a lethal-looking axe, holds by his tangled, wild hair a centaur, half-man, half-horse, a creature famous for being savage. Their bodies are strong and vivid, and the join of the man's body to that of a horse is so anatomically convincing you can imagine the artist having done some terrible surgical research. Athena is supremely alive, sexy. Botticelli's men and women are \"always attractive\" noticed the Victorian aesthete Walter Pater. </p> <p>Botticelli moved in the same circles as the Medici family in Florence, where pagan and Christian ideas were treated as aspects of the same divine truth. Botticelli gives ancient myth an unadorned energy. He does the same thing when he paints the Christian story. When in the 1490s Botticelli became a follower of the religious extremist Savonarola, who predicted the destruction of Florence and the salvation of only the few, he painted the Apocalypse with passionate urgency. In his Crucifixion with the Madonna and an Angel (1498-1500) Florence is about to be destroyed by fire from heaven. </p> <p>Botticelli's lucid way with myth makes his illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy, which are the core of this exhibition and will tour next year to the Royal Academy, his masterpiece and one of the giddiest high points of western art. His drawings take us in detail through Dante's three books, Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso, telling the entire poem in a sublime comic strip, presenting a diagram of Hell as an inverted mountain, a stepped funnel leading down to the place where great Satan eats souls. Botticelli keeps to this spatial conception as we follow Dante and Virgil from one scene of horror to another. They enter the City of Dis, where the houses are tombs imprisoning sinners in perpetual fire; they cross rivers of boiling blood where souls are tormented by \"hellrakers\", demons with spiked rakes; and they meet Centaurs, employed in hell along with harpies and gorgons to torture sinners. </p> <p>Botticelli's underworld is a fusion of Christian and pagan myth, drawn with a precise, unhesitating line that makes you believe he has just seen it all and set it down, quickly and accu rately. This is a mythological world that is comprehensively visible - until we reach Paradise. There, Botticelli leaves the pages almost blank. Paradise is not visible like Hell. It is not something we can picture. You cannot reinvent either Poussin or Botticelli as straight- forwardly Christian. Rome is right to celebrate the Christian dimension to European art in the Vatican's Jubilee Year. But to enjoy great works of art like these, you must also acknowledge the pagan mysteries. </p> <p>\u0095 The Hidden God, The Villa Medici, Rome (00 39 06 67611) until January 28. Botticelli: The Drawings for Dante's Divine Comedy (currently at the Scudiere Papali al Quirinale, Piazza Quirinale, Rome) opens at the Royal Academy, London, March 17, 2001.</p>",

While men react to pressure with a \"fight or flight\" response, women's hormonal make-up causes them to \"tend and befriend\". Ain't oestrogen grand? Peculiar, then, that anxiety produces a somewhat different response in Sidelines - either \"scream and shout\", \"punch and kick\" or \"drink and fall over\". \u0095 Proof, if proof be needed, that it is possible to have too much of a good thing. George Clooney has lost his \u00a310m job as Batman because he is, according to studio executives, too handsome. Which reminds Sidelines of the time we were asked to leave the world for being too hilarious.",

In the 1951 British election, when 83% turned out to vote, 97% of them voted Labour or Conservative. Second, economic competence, as proved or disproved in the previous few years, had a correlation with the next election result. There seemed to be a direct trade-off between votes and jobs. Democracies rewarded leaders who supplied high growth, low inflation and reduced unemployment.</p> <p>Neither rule any longer holds. Allegiance has lost the glue of heavy doctrinal disagreement. Politicians no longer refer to themselves, or the other side, as left or right (though it was startling to read in Peter Mandelson's important Morrison lecture last week a straight-faced reference to \"what Tony Blair calls One Nation socialism\" - a phrase not recently heard, I think, from Mr Blair). Simultaneously, economic success no longer guarantees anything. Look at Al Gore. He inherits the longest run of economic prosperity on every count - jobs, growth, stock market - America has known, but may today become the most shocking loser in American history.</p> <p>So America is replacing old paradigms. A sound economy is the basis not for endorsing present office-holders but flirting with their enemies. Instead of competence, the people dabble with dignity, respect, leadership and similar abstractions layered with moral coating. For Mr Blair, a Gore defeat will be worrying not because it signals, other than to exuberant rightist pattern-makers, the fall of the centre-left, but because it shows how unreliable the rewards can be for that old elusive goal, a solid economic record. Should Blair, also, be seeking an alternative appeal? Facing his own crisis, in the form of fuel protests, will he do so?</p> <p>In this de-racinated environment, nobody can be sure how big the crisis will be. A number of epithets fit the electorate that has evolved from the tribal, committed body of half-a-century ago. How about cynical, disbelieving, fickle, grasping, materialistic, self-centred, loose, indifferent? Perhaps it can't be relied on to identify the higher good, as against instant advantage. More engaged and less moralistic than the US electorate, it may be regarded as no less frightening. There's a temptation to search as desperately as Al Gore and George W Bush for the tricksy embraces that will win it over.</p> <p>This is not only unnecessary. It would also be dangerous. For one thing, Britain is at a different point in the electoral cycle, year four not year eight of a government the voters might feel free to get bored with, and casually throw out despite unprecedented economic prosperity. More important, it's by no means clear that in the end the British electorate want governments to be as irresolute as they are themselves. The old anchors have gone, but two new rules are cardinal in Blair's present situation.</p> <p>First, the government can't credibly amend its commitment to long-term economic stability. It paid a heavy political price for declaring this ambition from the start, and running public spending on a tight rein in its first two years. That's why health and transport, and now environmental protection, still show painful evidence of under-spending, more than three years in. The justification for that would be destroyed by a panicky pre-election blow-out.</p> <p>In his speech to the CBI yesterday, Gordon Brown rammed home the long-termist message. Many chancellors have spouted it before him. Nigel Lawson thought his tax-cutting 1988 budget laid the base for a long-term transformation of the economy; instead it contained the seed of the boom-and-bust that persisted into the 1990s. Mr Brown is making a believable virtue of the stability which is the goal he clings to. His prudent, sonorous, Scottish presence at the Treasury personifies the very reverse of fickleness. It's the essential precondition of survival for the governing party Labour has become. In place of left-right dialectic, he says, we offer a massive determination not to yield to short-term pressures. It's what - sometimes to our cost, and some times, as with pensions, by inhuman negligence we must correct - we are about.</p> <p>Second, the government needs to be in charge of politics. The lures the other way are devious and spectacularly dishonest. Watching the next bout of fuel protest gather, one sees newspapers apparently more united against it than they were last time, and a Conservative leadership mouthing its refusal to support direct action. But the words have weaselly accompaniments. We sympathise with the hauliers' predicament, says the Mail, we must understand their pain. By implication, their case is serious. Likewise, Conservative PR hacks like Lord Bell note the body of opinion which, according to a Sunday poll, would support further haulier blockades. Affecting merely clinical interest, on Breakfast with Frost, he can barely conceal a foaming excitement at the prospect.</p> <p>From a party viewpoint he may be right. The Tories look with keenest anticipation on the possible breakdown of Britain. But this only makes clearer the course the government must take. People expect it, above all else, to keep the country running. The lures must be resisted. So must the threats and the bogus ridicule. Of the many false arguments made in defence of the hauliers, the most corrupt is the claim that, if trouble now happens, ministers are to blame for taking measures to anticipate it. That such a travesty can be seriously touted in the same leader columns that two months ago were chiding ministers for their lack of readiness shows how political this dispute has become. If Blair wins this one, they're saying, he's got the election cold. Let us therefore do our best to see he doesn't.</p> <p>The public, however, takes a more complex attitude. It long ago lost the habit of political allegiance. It can still tell pollsters, before the damage starts, that it supports direct action in favour of lower fuel duties. But in the end it wants governments to govern. In its wisdom, it knows that this is how things must be, and also, even more plainly, that the alternative government now on offer is a non-starter. It is ready to channel short-termism, lower petrol prices, into temporary protest, but long-termism - its preference for future government - into the resumption of support for Labour, as was shown very clearly in opinion polls taken soon after the September calamities were over.</p> <p>To underpin this, Labour needs no quick fixes. Calling the government out of touch is another bogus crack. What would be out of touch would be to slide into submission to violent protest. The old anchors may have gone, but the demand for a government that does not drift from strategy and conviction has not. If anything, Labour ministers have been short of that quality. The fuel issue obliges them to reaffirm it. They're right to make their economic choice, and right to prepare their political defence, pending proof from the voters, at the democratic moment, that it's what they want.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

The old anchors have gone, but two new rules are cardinal in Blair's present situation. First, the government can't credibly amend its commitment to long-term economic stability. It paid a heavy political price for declaring this ambition from the start, and running public spending on a tight rein in its first two years. That's why health and transport, and now environmental protection, still show painful evidence of under-spending, more than three years in. The justification for that would be destroyed by a panicky pre-election blow-out. In his speech to the CBI yesterday, Gordon Brown rammed home the long-termist message. Many chancellors have spouted it before him. Nigel Lawson thought his tax-cutting 1988 budget laid the base for a long-term transformation of the economy; instead it contained the seed of the boom-and-bust that persisted into the 1990s. Mr Brown is making a believable virtue of the stability which is the goal he clings to. His prudent, sonorous, Scottish presence at the Treasury personifies the very reverse of fickleness. It's the essential precondition of survival for the governing party Labour has become. In place of left-right dialectic, he says, we offer a massive determination not to yield to short-term pressures. It's what - sometimes to our cost, and some times, as with pensions, by inhuman negligence we must correct - we are about. Second, the government needs to be in charge of politics. The lures the other way are devious and spectacularly dishonest. Watching the next bout of fuel protest gather, one sees newspapers apparently more united against it than they were last time, and a Conservative leadership mouthing its refusal to support direct action. But the words have weaselly accompaniments. We sympathise with the hauliers' predicament, says the Mail, we must understand their pain. By implication, their case is serious. Likewise, Conservative PR hacks like Lord Bell note the body of opinion which, according to a Sunday poll, would support further haulier blockades. Affecting merely clinical interest, on Breakfast with Frost, he can barely conceal a foaming excitement at the prospect. From a party viewpoint he may be right. The Tories look with keenest anticipation on the possible breakdown of Britain. But this only makes clearer the course the government must take. People expect it, above all else, to keep the country running. The lures must be resisted. So must the threats and the bogus ridicule. Of the many false arguments made in defence of the hauliers, the most corrupt is the claim that, if trouble now happens, ministers are to blame for taking measures to anticipate it. That such a travesty can be seriously touted in the same leader columns that two months ago were chiding ministers for their lack of readiness shows how political this dispute has become. If Blair wins this one, they're saying, he's got the election cold. Let us therefore do our best to see he doesn't. The public, however, takes a more complex attitude. It long ago lost the habit of political allegiance. It can still tell pollsters, before the damage starts, that it supports direct action in favour of lower fuel duties. But in the end it wants governments to govern. In its wisdom, it knows that this is how things must be, and also, even more plainly, that the alternative government now on offer is a non-starter. It is ready to channel short-termism, lower petrol prices, into temporary protest, but long-termism - its preference for future government - into the resumption of support for Labour, as was shown very clearly in opinion polls taken soon after the September calamities were over. To underpin this, Labour needs no quick fixes. Calling the government out of touch is another bogus crack. What would be out of touch would be to slide into submission to violent protest. The old anchors may have gone, but the demand for a government that does not drift from strategy and conviction has not. If anything, Labour ministers have been short of that quality. The fuel issue obliges them to reaffirm it. They're right to make their economic choice, and right to prepare their political defence, pending proof from the voters, at the democratic moment, that it's what they want. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "body": "<p>Jimmie Davis, who has died at the reputed age of 101, stood largely alone in the murky world of Louisiana politics. The apparent author of one of the world's best known songs, You Are My Sunshine, he twice served as state governor. At last year's celebration of his 100th birthday, one of his successors, Edwin Edwards - who spent most of his final term on trial for corruption - paid an awed tribute. \"Just imagine,\" he said, \"Jimmie served two terms as governor and was never indicted. That's a genuine achievement.\" It was also a pretty close-run thing.</p> <p>Yet, in the appalling political culture established by the Long family, Davis's legislative record was surprisingly benign. In a state still described as \"America's banana republic\", suffering some of the country's highest cancer, Aids and premature death rates, he introduced free school milk, accelerated hospital building, special care for the mentally ill and 6,000 miles of new roads.</p> <p>Davis claimed, at different times, to have been born in any year from 1899 to 1902. As sharecroppers in north Louisiana's cottonfields, his parents jammed 12 children into a two-roomed shack, and remained uncertain of the order of their birth. Davis said he had never slept in a bed until he was nine, and recalled a Christmas gift the children once received - a skinned blackbird and a dried pig's bladder. \"We ate the bird, and played ball with the bladder. I've never been happier with anything I've had since.\"</p> <p>Davis studied hard, at primary school, high school, and Louisiana College, graduating in education. After a year teaching at his old primary school, he enrolled at Louisiana state university for a master's degree. Throughout this period, he also pursued his musical career.</p> <p>In 1929, he became clerk to Shreveport city court. Huey Long had just become governor of Louisiana, exerting his demagogic power and offering his share-the-wealth policy of social services and vast public works - which were mostly a mechanism to siphon off huge sums for himself. For 10 years, Davis quietly consolidated his own political career, combining it with increasing popularity as a singer. In 1938, he won his first election, becoming commissioner of public safety for Shreveport - controlling the police and fire services.</p> <p>He soon moved to the state public service commission, a body at the heart of the Long family's financial shenanigans. From this key position, he emerged as the likeliest figure to unite the state's bitterly feuding political factions, the Long family and those they had ousted from their lucrative state pickings.</p> <p>In 1944, with most of America's attention fixed on the second world war, Davis launched one of the most eccentric gubernatorial campaigns in US history. Relying on his musical reputation, he took his band across the state, concentrating primarily on giving the crowds a good time - and romped into the governor's mansion.</p> <p>One of his first acts was to introduce driving licences to a population which had never thought them necessary. Though he successfully advanced the social measures being advocated nationally by his old ally President Truman, he was criticised for frequent absences from the office, not least to star in a 1947 Hollywood film about his own life.</p> <p>Unable, under state law, to succeed himself, he concentrated throughout the 1950s on a musical career. But in 1960, with the explosive issue of desegregation filling the political horizon, he was again elected governor as a compromise candidate.</p> <p>Davis then seemed to act as just another redneck bigot, calling five special sessions of the state legislature to combat federal desegregation orders, and eventually seeing this rearguard campaign struck down by the US supreme court. He later justified his actions on the grounds that they offered the least bad option. \"Everybody ran on the segregation ticket. You couldn't be elected without it. When desegregation came, we did it without having anybody killed. We didn't even have a fist-fight\".</p> <p>His first wife died in 1968.

      "bodyText": "Jimmie Davis, who has died at the reputed age of 101, stood largely alone in the murky world of Louisiana politics. The apparent author of one of the world's best known songs, You Are My Sunshine, he twice served as state governor. At last year's celebration of his 100th birthday, one of his successors, Edwin Edwards - who spent most of his final term on trial for corruption - paid an awed tribute. \"Just imagine,\" he said, \"Jimmie served two terms as governor and was never indicted. That's a genuine achievement.\" It was also a pretty close-run thing. Yet, in the appalling political culture established by the Long family, Davis's legislative record was surprisingly benign. In a state still described as \"America's banana republic\", suffering some of the country's highest cancer, Aids and premature death rates, he introduced free school milk, accelerated hospital building, special care for the mentally ill and 6,000 miles of new roads. Davis claimed, at different times, to have been born in any year from 1899 to 1902. As sharecroppers in north Louisiana's cottonfields, his parents jammed 12 children into a two-roomed shack, and remained uncertain of the order of their birth. Davis said he had never slept in a bed until he was nine, and recalled a Christmas gift the children once received - a skinned blackbird and a dried pig's bladder. \"We ate the bird, and played ball with the bladder. I've never been happier with anything I've had since.\" Davis studied hard, at primary school, high school, and Louisiana College, graduating in education. After a year teaching at his old primary school, he enrolled at Louisiana state university for a master's degree. Throughout this period, he also pursued his musical career. In 1929, he became clerk to Shreveport city court. Huey Long had just become governor of Louisiana, exerting his demagogic power and offering his share-the-wealth policy of social services and vast public works - which were mostly a mechanism to siphon off huge sums for himself. For 10 years, Davis quietly consolidated his own political career, combining it with increasing popularity as a singer. In 1938, he won his first election, becoming commissioner of public safety for Shreveport - controlling the police and fire services. He soon moved to the state public service commission, a body at the heart of the Long family's financial shenanigans. From this key position, he emerged as the likeliest figure to unite the state's bitterly feuding political factions, the Long family and those they had ousted from their lucrative state pickings. In 1944, with most of America's attention fixed on the second world war, Davis launched one of the most eccentric gubernatorial campaigns in US history. Relying on his musical reputation, he took his band across the state, concentrating primarily on giving the crowds a good time - and romped into the governor's mansion. One of his first acts was to introduce driving licences to a population which had never thought them necessary. Though he successfully advanced the social measures being advocated nationally by his old ally President Truman, he was criticised for frequent absences from the office, not least to star in a 1947 Hollywood film about his own life. Unable, under state law, to succeed himself, he concentrated throughout the 1950s on a musical career. But in 1960, with the explosive issue of desegregation filling the political horizon, he was again elected governor as a compromise candidate. Davis then seemed to act as just another redneck bigot, calling five special sessions of the state legislature to combat federal desegregation orders, and eventually seeing this rearguard campaign struck down by the US supreme court. He later justified his actions on the grounds that they offered the least bad option. \"Everybody ran on the segregation ticket. You couldn't be elected without it. When desegregation came, we did it without having anybody killed. We didn't even have a fist-fight\". His first wife died in 1968. He is survived by his second wife, Anna, and a son. Tony Russell writes: Jimmie Davis always maintained that You Are My Sunshine was his bright idea. When reminded that other artists had recorded the song before him, he invented even earlier sessions at which, he claimed, he had recorded it, but, unsatisfied, vetoed its release. The truth seems to be that Davis bought the song for $35 from a musician who needed to pay his wife's hospital bills.

John Patrick Kenneally VC, soldier, born March 15 1921; died September 28 2000",

First reactions are encouraging: \"I am glad to see finally,\" says one respondent, \"that someone has had the sense to make fishing licences available online\". Finally. But why so long?</p> <p>\u0095 Word arrives that the Sunday Express is still being published, and that its magazine has enjoyed a triumph. On page 4 on Sunday, the regular A Good Walk feature advised readers to \"take a stroll about Guy Fawkes's birthplace, York city\". An excellent idea. York is \"readily accessible by train\", after all. \"Cross the Ouse by Lendal Bridge,\" is one recommendation.</p> <p>\u0095 A Sun leader heightens concern, meanwhile, about alopecian editor David Yelland. Dismissing the George W Bush drink-driving story as an irrelevant smear, it declares: \"We hope you've noticed that the Sun doesn't rake over people's private indiscretions unless there is a justifiable public interest\". Not a shred of irony. In that same edition, penis size-obsessed showbiz hack Dominic Mohan reports that Ronnie Wood has fallen off the wagon. Doubtless if he came to the phone David could explain why an old rock star's drink problem is more in the public interest than a would-be US president's. He won't, however, and until we see the neurologist's report on residual damage from the subway door shutting on his Irish jig, we'll need to keep a closer eye on Old Slappy.</p> <p>\u0095 A fax addressed to \"Matty lad\", on Daily Telegraph paper and simply signed (as if from a peer) \"Henderson\", arrives at home. The author seems cross. \"What marvellous certainty you have,\" his Lordship begins. \"Petrol protesters are charlatans, the C of E is run by imbeciles . . . Stephen Glover is a bore . . .\" And so on. He's not pleased. \"When people see you waddling along Goldhawk Road,\" (a neighbouring West London thoroughfare) with that capacious arse hanging out of your pants, exhibiting that air of effortless superiority, I'm sure they can make up their own minds about you. They do.\" Capacious arse? If anyone has any idea who Henderson might be, and how he managed to steal Telegraph writing paper, do get in touch.</p> <p>\u0095 The C of E run by imbeciles? What a thought. You will recall the leaflet sent to those attending the General Synod later this month. Apart from warning them that November can be chilly and they should bring warm clothing, it also has information on accommodation. \"The Union Jack Club (Waterloo) is the cheaper, with a large restaurant and an even larger bar,\" it explains. \"It has tight military security and is hung around with tanks and pictures of VCs. An 'en suite' is recommended, as you may not wish to compete with paratroopers for the bathroom.\" Just right for those who need reminding to wear coats when it's cold.</p> <p>\u0095 A courageous bank robbery has ended unluckily in Lyons, where Jean Tournier was close to making good his escape with \u00a315,000 in cash when a customer dived and, in rugby tackle style, took his legs. Literally, in one case. When the police arrived they found Jean sitting on the floor politely requesting the return of his artificial limb.</p>",

Dismissing the George W Bush drink-driving story as an irrelevant smear, it declares: \"We hope you've noticed that the Sun doesn't rake over people's private indiscretions unless there is a justifiable public interest\". Not a shred of irony. In that same edition, penis size-obsessed showbiz hack Dominic Mohan reports that Ronnie Wood has fallen off the wagon. Doubtless if he came to the phone David could explain why an old rock star's drink problem is more in the public interest than a would-be US president's. He won't, however, and until we see the neurologist's report on residual damage from the subway door shutting on his Irish jig, we'll need to keep a closer eye on Old Slappy. \u0095 A fax addressed to \"Matty lad\", on Daily Telegraph paper and simply signed (as if from a peer) \"Henderson\", arrives at home. The author seems cross. \"What marvellous certainty you have,\" his Lordship begins. \"Petrol protesters are charlatans, the C of E is run by imbeciles . . . Stephen Glover is a bore . . .\" And so on. He's not pleased. \"When people see you waddling along Goldhawk Road,\" (a neighbouring West London thoroughfare) with that capacious arse hanging out of your pants, exhibiting that air of effortless superiority, I'm sure they can make up their own minds about you. They do.\" Capacious arse? If anyone has any idea who Henderson might be, and how he managed to steal Telegraph writing paper, do get in touch. \u0095 The C of E run by imbeciles? What a thought. You will recall the leaflet sent to those attending the General Synod later this month. Apart from warning them that November can be chilly and they should bring warm clothing, it also has information on accommodation. \"The Union Jack Club (Waterloo) is the cheaper, with a large restaurant and an even larger bar,\" it explains. \"It has tight military security and is hung around with tanks and pictures of VCs. An 'en suite' is recommended, as you may not wish to compete with paratroopers for the bathroom.\" Just right for those who need reminding to wear coats when it's cold. \u0095 A courageous bank robbery has ended unluckily in Lyons, where Jean Tournier was close to making good his escape with \u00a315,000 in cash when a customer dived and, in rugby tackle style, took his legs. Literally, in one case. When the police arrived they found Jean sitting on the floor politely requesting the return of his artificial limb.",

      "body": "<p>Cruise passengers were yesterday promised a \"new golden age of sea travel\" as Cunard unveiled plans for its lavish 150,000 tonne Queen Mary 2, set to be the world's biggest ocean liner.</p> <p>Touted as the \"grandest and largest liner ever built\", the pledge came from the French shipyard that has now signed a contract with the shipping line to build the \u00a3538m vessel.</p> <p>With a home port of Southampton and flying the British flag, the QM2 will be in service by 2003 - nearly 70 years after the 80,000 tonne Queen Mary was launched. The new liner will also be the first built for Cunard since the QE2 in 1967.</p> <p>\"We are pleased to have been selected for one of the most sought after and highly anticipated shipbuilding contracts in modern day cruising,\" said Patrick Boissier, chairman of shipbuilders Alstom Chantiers de l'Atlantique.</p> <p>Cunard president Larry Pimentel said the new 2,630-passenger ship would follow in the tradition of other great Cunard vessels. Of all the new cruise ships which have been ordered in recent years, none has captured the industry's collective imagination more than the Queen Mary 2.</p> <p>She will measure 237ft (72 metres) from keel to funnel top, towering over 200ft above her waterline, and will cover an area of 3.5 acres.</p> <p>Alstom Chantiers, based at St Nazaire, will now begin calculating specifications and ordering materials.</p> <p>Cunard had initially said it did not think any British shipyard could build the QM2. Later, though, Belfast's Harland and Wolff emerged as a front runner.</p> <p>Yesterday Peter Harbinson, Harland's spokesman, said the loss of the contract had been a \"great disappointment\" as it could have revived Britain's depressed shipbuilding industry.</p> <p>\"It is a blow to lose out on any contract but more so one of the prestige and magnitude of this one. It would have been a very major project over a considerable time frame. Had we been successful it would have given a stimulus, not only to Harland but to the whole of the British ship building industry because these very large luxury cruise ships tend to be built predominantly among four to five yards in Europe. It would have opened up other possibilities for us and provided another element of competition.\"</p> <p>Asked why the Belfast yard had missed out, Mr Pimentel replied they had considered four or five shipyards.</p> <p>\"We did consider putting together a team at Harland and Wolff. In fact the chairman went there and we thought they had the capabilities with regard to steel structures,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But difficulties arose in the ability to build the refined hotel part of the vessel.\"</p> <p><b>The ship of things to come</b></p> <p>\u0095She is 1,132ft (345 metres) long and will have a crew of 1,254</p> <p>\u0095Her power plant will produce sufficient electricity to light a city the size of Southampton (population 200,000) and the engines will produce 157,000 horsepower - the equivalent of 1,570 family cars.</p> <p>\u0095The main dining room, which will span the width of the ship will seat 1,310 passengers.</p> <p>\u0095A 1,100-seater main lounge will feature Broadway-style productions</p> <p>\u0095There will be a nightclub, a planetarium, an education area where passengers can take instruction on seamanship, cooking and languages, and a casino</p> <p>\u0095There will be four outside swimming pools, one with a sliding glass roof, a promenade deck, kennels and pet areas</p> <p>\u0095There will be nine classes of cabin from duplex apartments and penthouse suites - both of which will feature butler service - to standard cabins</p> <p>\u0095She will be able to reach speeds of almost 30 knots (nearly 35mph)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cruise passengers were yesterday promised a \"new golden age of sea travel\" as Cunard unveiled plans for its lavish 150,000 tonne Queen Mary 2, set to be the world's biggest ocean liner. Touted as the \"grandest and largest liner ever built\", the pledge came from the French shipyard that has now signed a contract with the shipping line to build the \u00a3538m vessel. With a home port of Southampton and flying the British flag, the QM2 will be in service by 2003 - nearly 70 years after the 80,000 tonne Queen Mary was launched. The new liner will also be the first built for Cunard since the QE2 in 1967. \"We are pleased to have been selected for one of the most sought after and highly anticipated shipbuilding contracts in modern day cruising,\" said Patrick Boissier, chairman of shipbuilders Alstom Chantiers de l'Atlantique. Cunard president Larry Pimentel said the new 2,630-passenger ship would follow in the tradition of other great Cunard vessels. Of all the new cruise ships which have been ordered in recent years, none has captured the industry's collective imagination more than the Queen Mary 2. She will measure 237ft (72 metres) from keel to funnel top, towering over 200ft above her waterline, and will cover an area of 3.5 acres. Alstom Chantiers, based at St Nazaire, will now begin calculating specifications and ordering materials. Cunard had initially said it did not think any British shipyard could build the QM2. Later, though, Belfast's Harland and Wolff emerged as a front runner. Yesterday Peter Harbinson, Harland's spokesman, said the loss of the contract had been a \"great disappointment\" as it could have revived Britain's depressed shipbuilding industry. \"It is a blow to lose out on any contract but more so one of the prestige and magnitude of this one. It would have been a very major project over a considerable time frame. Had we been successful it would have given a stimulus, not only to Harland but to the whole of the British ship building industry because these very large luxury cruise ships tend to be built predominantly among four to five yards in Europe. It would have opened up other possibilities for us and provided another element of competition.\" Asked why the Belfast yard had missed out, Mr Pimentel replied they had considered four or five shipyards. \"We did consider putting together a team at Harland and Wolff. In fact the chairman went there and we thought they had the capabilities with regard to steel structures,\" he said. \"But difficulties arose in the ability to build the refined hotel part of the vessel.\" The ship of things to come \u0095She is 1,132ft (345 metres) long and will have a crew of 1,254 \u0095Her power plant will produce sufficient electricity to light a city the size of Southampton (population 200,000) and the engines will produce 157,000 horsepower - the equivalent of 1,570 family cars. \u0095The main dining room, which will span the width of the ship will seat 1,310 passengers. \u0095A 1,100-seater main lounge will feature Broadway-style productions \u0095There will be a nightclub, a planetarium, an education area where passengers can take instruction on seamanship, cooking and languages, and a casino \u0095There will be four outside swimming pools, one with a sliding glass roof, a promenade deck, kennels and pet areas \u0095There will be nine classes of cabin from duplex apartments and penthouse suites - both of which will feature butler service - to standard cabins \u0095She will be able to reach speeds of almost 30 knots (nearly 35mph)",

In a saga that makes Trevor Nunn's National Theatre resemble an oasis of serenity, 300 people stormed the stage to demand the return of its director, the wonderboy of Italian cinema Mario Martone who, citing dark forces of persecution, quit his post last week after two tumultuous years. A daring, innovative period of Italian theatre is in danger of being squashed by establishment reactionaries, his supporters say. A string of commercial failures which insulted Catholicism and brought a once-great institution to its knees has been halted, his critics reply. On one thing everybody agrees: the politicisation of the arts has turned the publicly funded theatre into an election football. Inaugurated at Largo di Torre Argentina in 1732, the theatre was supposed to embark on a renaissance under Mr Martone, 40, from Naples. Yesterday the Democratic Left, the former communist who are the biggest party in the government coaltion, begged him to return. The far-right National Alliance, the descendants of Mussolini's blackshirts, suggested that he should stay in Naples. Mr Martone, a judge at last May's Cannes film festival, resigned last week after accusing colleagues and politicians of smears and intimidation. In an open letter to the mayor of Rome, he said that an \"infamous campaign\" had made his tenure impossible. His decision to stage a series of plays dealing with Islam in the middle of the Vatican's jubilee flushed out intolerance, he said. Blaming the board's two rightwing members, he said they were backed by their parties, which control the province of Rome and region of Lazio Walter Pedulla, president of the board, said fringe topics had alienated audiences and led to financial meltdown - a claim denied by the director.

      "body": "<p>As the European Union prepares to issue a report tomorrow telling Ankara what it must do to pursue its ambition of membership, the Turkish army is setting out its stall for peace after years of brutal suppression of the Kurdish rebellion in the south-east.</p> <p>With an eye on EU membership, it is claiming victory in its war on the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and pursuing new challenges.</p> <p>In the remote highlands of Tunceli, a former PKK stronghold, the situation appears to have changed dramatically. Only a few dozen rebels remain in the mountains - most PKK members have withdrawn hundreds of miles across the border into northern Iraq.</p> <p>\"This region needs social and economic help,\" General Tuncer Kilinc, commander of the 3rd Army, said.</p> <p>\"The people are fed up with terrorism and now we are all fighting together.\"</p> <p>Severe restrictions on travel in Tunceli and an embargo on the movement of food supplies have been lifted. A state of emergency remains in place, and there is still a huge military presence, but local people hope the violence has come to a permanent end.</p> <p>\"We used to live in the midst of the bullets,\" a village official said. \"But the soldiers have really changed.</p> <p>\"They used to beat us and curse us, but they don't do it any more. It's been banned.\"</p> <p>Instead, the army is making an effort to win hearts and minds by building roads, improving schools and touring villages with mobile health clinics.</p> <p>But the task ahead is huge: unemployment is sky-high and many villages have been forcibly evacuated by the state.</p> <p>The EU has already welcomed the new focus on economic development rather than military might - it has been urging Ankara to take steps in this direction since well before the capture and trial of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan last year.</p> <p>But there are some subjects that the army is still unwilling to discuss, including identity, ethnicity, and Kurdishness. These are issues on which the EU is expecting Ankara to make greater progress.</p> <p>\"Ordinary people want peace,\" said Professor Dogu Ergil, an expert on the southeast, \"but they want peace with dignity. That means being acknowledged as Kurds, and respected as Kurds.\"</p> <p>And that simply has not yet happened. To many Turkish soldiers, and indeed many politicians, concessions to those who want Kurdish cultural rights smack of concessions to the PKK.</p> <p>After 15 years of bitter conflict and an estimated 300,00 deaths, senior generals have issued blunt warnings that they will not allow the PKK to gain in the political arena what it failed to win on the battlefield.</p> <p>The army has been busy erecting dozens of statues of modern Turkey's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in Tunceli. The message is not lost on local people.</p> <p>\"We'll have to see how things go,\" a man said as he watched the opening ceremony of a new children's playground built by the military.</p> <p>\"We need jobs, but we need a little bit more as well.

      "bodyText": "As the European Union prepares to issue a report tomorrow telling Ankara what it must do to pursue its ambition of membership, the Turkish army is setting out its stall for peace after years of brutal suppression of the Kurdish rebellion in the south-east. With an eye on EU membership, it is claiming victory in its war on the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and pursuing new challenges. In the remote highlands of Tunceli, a former PKK stronghold, the situation appears to have changed dramatically. Only a few dozen rebels remain in the mountains - most PKK members have withdrawn hundreds of miles across the border into northern Iraq. \"This region needs social and economic help,\" General Tuncer Kilinc, commander of the 3rd Army, said. \"The people are fed up with terrorism and now we are all fighting together.\" Severe restrictions on travel in Tunceli and an embargo on the movement of food supplies have been lifted. A state of emergency remains in place, and there is still a huge military presence, but local people hope the violence has come to a permanent end. \"We used to live in the midst of the bullets,\" a village official said. \"But the soldiers have really changed. \"They used to beat us and curse us, but they don't do it any more. It's been banned.\" Instead, the army is making an effort to win hearts and minds by building roads, improving schools and touring villages with mobile health clinics. But the task ahead is huge: unemployment is sky-high and many villages have been forcibly evacuated by the state. The EU has already welcomed the new focus on economic development rather than military might - it has been urging Ankara to take steps in this direction since well before the capture and trial of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan last year. But there are some subjects that the army is still unwilling to discuss, including identity, ethnicity, and Kurdishness. These are issues on which the EU is expecting Ankara to make greater progress. \"Ordinary people want peace,\" said Professor Dogu Ergil, an expert on the southeast, \"but they want peace with dignity. That means being acknowledged as Kurds, and respected as Kurds.\" And that simply has not yet happened. To many Turkish soldiers, and indeed many politicians, concessions to those who want Kurdish cultural rights smack of concessions to the PKK. After 15 years of bitter conflict and an estimated 300,00 deaths, senior generals have issued blunt warnings that they will not allow the PKK to gain in the political arena what it failed to win on the battlefield. The army has been busy erecting dozens of statues of modern Turkey's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in Tunceli. The message is not lost on local people. \"We'll have to see how things go,\" a man said as he watched the opening ceremony of a new children's playground built by the military. \"We need jobs, but we need a little bit more as well. Let's see what they have in mind\". There are still reminders of the bad old days in the southeast. In a province adjoining the Iraqi border, 12 PKK fighters were killed in a clash with the army a few days ago. Elsewhere, three civilians returning to their village for the first time in years were shot dead. Officially the PKK was blamed, but it has denied being involved, and many local politicians are convinced that state forces were responsible. There are growing calls for a full inquiry. Even if the war is officially over, the potential for violence has not gone away. The military high command says it is determined to hunt down every PKK member until the rebels turn in their weapons and permanently surrender to the state. Few civilians in the south-east have any intention of taking on the army, but many have yet to be won over by the charm offensive. The army' may have a job on if its goal is to turn out standardised Turks in every town and village.",

Government figures show that up to 25% of Kenyans are HIV positive, but only 2% can afford the recommended cocktail of anti-retroviral medicines. At about 432,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a33,800) for a year's course, the cost of treating all the infected Kenyans would exceed the national budget. \"Instead, our people are left to succumb to what doctors in Kenya have become adept at doing: simply managing their decline and death,\" Dr Chris Ouma of the charity Action Aid said. \"The ministry of health cannot provide the most basic medicines,\" Dr Abdullah said. \"It cannot treat malaria, it cannot treat diarrhoea, and it will never be able to treat Aids at any western price.\" The World Trade Organisation (WTO), which draws more than three-quarters of its members from the developing world, sets the patent controls that have, in part, maintained current price levels. In January Kenya must agree to extend its patent protection from the seven years stipulated in British colonial law to the WTO's 20 years, sealing the western pharmaceutical companies exclusive rights to anti-retroviral treatments for several generations of Aids patients. Dr Sophie-Marie Scouflaire, head of the Access to Essential Medicines campaign for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), agreed that price cuts were not the answer. \"Price reductions are just a tool of the multinationals to try to stop Africa producing its own drugs,\" she said. \"We want to see patent law change entirely, to see all drugs produced locally or imported from cheaper producers, currently outside patent law.

The temperature inside the car, where three-month-old Courtney Trueman had been placed by her mother Marie, would have risen \"like an oven\", Susan Klonin, for the prosecution, told Manchester crown court. Mrs Trueman, 32, of Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, denies manslaughter and cruelty. She dressed Courtney in warm clothes before placing her in the fleecy car seat of the Metro in the drive, with the door and windows shut, on June 26 last year. Miss Klonin said that temperatures outdoors would have been between 19C (66F) and 22C (72F). \"Inside the car, parked on concrete in full sunlight in the drive, sheltered from the breeze, the temperature must have risen like an oven,\" she told the jury. \"You wouldn't leave your pet in the car in those conditions and leaving a little baby there in that way was a reckless disregard for the dangers to the baby's health and welfare.\" Miss Klonin said that Mrs Trueman appeared to have fragile mental health and to be educationally limited. She said that after putting Courtney in the car Mrs Trueman had then \"settled down to do a bit of pottering around the garden\", moving some rocks and stones and sunbathing for around two hours. On the day of the baby's death Mrs Trueman's behaviour was \"certainly bizarre\". She had been seen in a field next to the house staring at stones. It was only when her hus band Andrew returned two hours later that they realised the baby was in distress. \"Courtney's eyes were glazed and she couldn't catch her breath,\" Miss Klonin said. The couple tried to bathe her with cold water and sought help over the telephone from Mr Trueman's mother, who told them to call an ambulance. Courtney died in hospital 75 minutes later. At first Mrs Trueman appeared not to be taking the matter seriously, but when it became clear her baby had died her distress was obvious. Mrs Trueman told police that while Courtney was in the car she had \"glanced over\" twice in her direction. Miss Klonin told the jury: \"Mrs Trueman committed the manslaughter of Courtney by an act of gross negligence. \"She did not deliberately kill her baby. She did not want her baby to be killed, she did not wish for that, but what she did caused the death of Courtney by gross negligence. \"The prosecution must prove Mrs Trueman had a duty of care for Courtney. She was the mother of a defenceless, helpless baby. You may think it was clear she had a duty of care.\" She said that the issue was not whether Trueman, \"limited as she was\", had failed to appreciate the risk or failed to notice the baby was in distress. \"The test is whether anyone in that position, a mother putting a baby in the car in that way, should have cared for her, should have appreciated, should have noticed and should have responded to the signs she would have seen had she bothered to look,\" said Miss Klonin.

      "bodyText": "An angry and embittered woman appeared before a Paris court yesterday armed with enough ammunition to sink President Jacques Chirac's re-election campaign before it gets properly under way. Xavi\u00e8re Tiberi, the wife of the embattled mayor of Paris, Jean Tiberi, went on trial again a year after the case against her was dropped on a technicality. The case arises from a series of potentially explosive criminal investigations into sleaze in President Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic (RPR) party. There is nothing particularly outrageous about the offence with which Mrs Tiberi is charged.The prosecution alleges that in 1994 she was paid \u00a321,000 by the district council of Essonne, just outside Paris, which was led at the time by Xavier Dugoin, a now-disgraced former RPR senator and close political ally of her husband. Investigating magistrates discovered that the only work she did for the council was to produce a laughable 36-page report, most of it copied from a book and stuffed with elementary mistakes, on the prospects for economic cooperation between Essonne and French-speaking countries. Compared with some of the other alleged dodgy dealings in the Paris town hall while Mr Chirac was mayor from 1987 to 1995 - before he won the presidential elections and passed the mayor's job on to his once - loyal lieutenant Jean Tiberi - this is small beer. Two magistrates are investigating claims that hundreds of RPR activists were given well-paid but non-existent jobs at city hall, others are looking at the increasing evidence that the party's coffers were illegally filled by kickbacks from building companies with Paris council housing contracts. RPR officials have tried before to halt the investigation of Mrs Tiberi's now-infamous report. Late in 1996 the justice ministry chartered a helicopter in the Himalayas and sent the first-secretary of the French embassy in Nepal into the mountains to bring back the holidaying state prosecutor, who might have been able to dismiss the case. This time the stakes are even higher. The French equivalent of Private Eye, Le Canard Enchain\u00e9, has quoted former city hall colleagues of Mr Chirac as saying that the future president was personally responsible for ensuring that Mrs Tiberi was given a fake job by a friendly local council. But the main reason the RPR is worried by Mrs Tiberi's appearance in the dock is that her efficient but uncharismatic husband was kicked out of the party last month, having refused to accept its decision that a more glamorous heavyweight candidate should stand for mayor in next year's municipal elections. A furious Mr Tiberi has already issued a thinly veiled warning that he is not prepared to carry the can for the illicit fundraising and other scams allegedly presided over by his more illustrious predecessor. His wife, who has sworn to \"stand by him till the end\", could prove to be his best weapon. \"She is understandably absolutely livid,\" said a Chirac aide who asked not to be named. \"She was already fed up with her husband taking the corruption flak. This is a couple which has nothing to lose - she could prove very, very dangerous.\" Mrs Tiberi was not called upon to speak in court yesterday, when the opening statements were made. The court is expected to deliver its verdict later this month.",

Animals are reared without the drugs such as antibiotics and wormers which are used in most traditional livestock farming. All organic food production and processing is also governed by strict guidelines set down by law. Detailed records must be kept so that you can find out how the food got from the farm to your plate. </p> <p><strong>How do organic farms deal with pests?</strong> </p> <p>Organic farmers aim to make their soil healthy and fertile, and they grow a mixture of crops. They hope this will attract a wide variety of insects - such as ladybirds - and other wildlife which will benefit the crops by acting as natural predators on pests. Earthworms, and other very small animals or insects - micro-organisms - keep soil healthy. </p> <p><strong> What are the benefits of organic farming?</strong> </p> <p>The Soil Association - which controls organic farming - believes that this type of farming is important for the well-being of animals, the environment and humans alike. Organic animals can graze in fields, are provided with comfortable bedding and are not housed in cramped conditions. </p> <p>Surveys by government departments like the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) have shown that organic farming can be good for wildlife. This is because the chemical pesticides used in large-scale farming often destroy the useful organisms in the soil, and the helpful plants and insects as well as those which attack the crops. When the pesticides destroy natural habitats like this, it means fewer food sources for other animals, birds and insects. </p> <p>Studies have also shown that organic food has more vitamins and beneficial chemicals, for example iron or zinc - known as trace elements - than food not grown organically. </p> <p>Some of the pesticides used on non-organic foods can even be extremely poisonous to humans. Scientists have said what the safe levels are, but there has not been much research into what happens when pesticides are mixed together. </p> <p><strong>Would organic farming have prevented the outbreak of BSE?</strong> </p> <p>Scientists do not know how cattle first came to be infected with BSE, so it can't be said for certain that organic farming would have prevented the disease. However, in 1983, long before the crisis began, the Soil Association banned the use of animal remains in the feeds of cud-chewing animals - known as ruminants - such as cows and sheep. There has not been a recorded case of BSE in any herd that has been fully organic since before 1985. </p> <p><strong>How much of British farming is currently organic?</strong> </p> <p>MAFF calculates there are currently 540,191 hectares of land either in full organic use or in the process of being converted; this is about 3% of all the UK's agriculture. Consumer demand for organic food has risen for the past two years at a rate of 40%. But the estimated total of organic food sales in the UK for 1999/00 is \u00a3546m - only 1% of all food sales. </p> <p><strong>What are the drawbacks of organic farming?</strong> </p> <p>Organic food usually costs more to produce and so is more expensive than non-organic foods. Many people say that organic foods are a luxury. But traditional farmers say they could not produce the amount of food needed and at a cheap price without pesticides. </p> <p><strong>Could we produce enough food to feed the world's population using organic processes? </strong> </p> <p>The Soil Association says that Britain is already self-sufficient in many foods and produces more than we need in others.

      "body": "<p><strong> Dr Carolyn Skilling, director, National Association for the Education of Sick Children</strong> </p> <p>Firstly, go back to your son's school, even if you've talked to them already, and get them to make arrangements to send work home for him. The school may refer you to the local education authority's support services for sick children, who can provide home tuition. The local education authority is legally responsible for ensuring children out of school for any reason receive a \"suitable education\" (Education Act, 1996). Typically, they will assign one or more tutors for between three to six hours a week. </p> <p>If you still feel your son's education is inadequate and fragmented, you might then look for an external supplier of home tuition. However, we wouldn't advise removing him from the school roll, as he would then lose his rights and entitlement. As parents, you would become solely responsible for his education. In this case, the school would be likely to inform the LEA's education welfare service and you would have to argue the case with them as to why he was being kept away from school. </p> <p>If you do decide to look for alternative teaching arrangements, you should be able to hire home tutors yourself. A more recent innovation is electronic tuition by tutors connected via the internet. The service run by the National Association for the Education of Sick Children offers various forms of help. In some circumstances, the LEA will pay for such a service to discharge its legal obligations. </p> <p><strong> Legal requirements: </strong>Local education authorities must arrange for the provision of suitable education for children of compulsory school age (DfEE circular 11/99). \"Suitable\" education is defined as \"efficient education suitable to the age, ability, aptitude and to any special educational needs the child may have.\" </p> <p>LEAs decide what is suitable education out of school for a particular child - in consultation with parents and in line with their own policies and the efficient use of resources. Where a child is ill for up to a month, this will be the provision of work by your child's teachers, to help him or her keep up with what is being done in school. </p> <p>For a longer illness, a tutor may provide home tuition up to key stage 3; at key stage 4, specialist tutors may be provided to fulfil GCSE course requirements. Again, this varies from LEA to LEA. </p> <p>In all cases, parents should contact the school in the first instance, which should be able to put them in touch with the education welfare service in their area. Many LEAs also provide advice via a pupil support service, which can help both parents and the school. This is especially pertinent if the school has not had to deal with a long-term illness in the past and may not be aware of the full range of services available to you and your child. </p> <p>\u0095 The National Association for the Education of Sick Children is a charity working to improve educational opportunity for all children whose education is disrupted by illness. Free-phone 0800 027 8523 or visit: <a href=\"http://www.sickchildren.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sickchildren.org.uk</a></p> <p><strong> Susan Littlemore, from Parentline Plus</strong> </p> <p>It's entirely natural to focus all your attention upon your child and the issues surrounding their well being - but you must acknowledge the stress that this puts you under too. </p> <p>When a child is ill, especially for a long time, inevitably the whole family has to rearrange its home and working life. If possible, explain what has been happening to your employer, and how this is affecting you. She or he could prove to be of real support. </p> <p>You're bound to feel anxious when your child goes back to school, even for the occasional day - this is a transition period for you and your child, with all the incumbent worries and concerns. </p> <p>It's vital to talk about this - try to look beyond the immediate context of your child's illness to your own health. It may help to talk to your GP for a referral to a counsellor, or to contact your local family centre. There may be a support group that can help regarding a specific illness, or contact an advice line such as Parentline Plus. </p> <p>Many parents feel anger and frustration, born out of tiredness, isolation and lack of support - especially when you're at home with a sick child. Often these emotions are reflected onto the child. By seeking time and attention for yourself, you will be more able to offer such support to your child. </p> <p>\u0095 Parentline Plus can be contacted on freephone 0808 800 2222, or visit: <a href=\"http://www.parentlineplus.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.parentlineplus.org.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Next week's problem:</strong> My child doesn't get much physical activity. She is bogged down with homework most nights, and isn't spending much time at school doing PE or sport. What should she be doing at school, how can I get her more active, and am I right to be concerned?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dr Carolyn Skilling, director, National Association for the Education of Sick Children Firstly, go back to your son's school, even if you've talked to them already, and get them to make arrangements to send work home for him. The school may refer you to the local education authority's support services for sick children, who can provide home tuition. The local education authority is legally responsible for ensuring children out of school for any reason receive a \"suitable education\" (Education Act, 1996). Typically, they will assign one or more tutors for between three to six hours a week. If you still feel your son's education is inadequate and fragmented, you might then look for an external supplier of home tuition. However, we wouldn't advise removing him from the school roll, as he would then lose his rights and entitlement. As parents, you would become solely responsible for his education. In this case, the school would be likely to inform the LEA's education welfare service and you would have to argue the case with them as to why he was being kept away from school. If you do decide to look for alternative teaching arrangements, you should be able to hire home tutors yourself. A more recent innovation is electronic tuition by tutors connected via the internet. The service run by the National Association for the Education of Sick Children offers various forms of help. In some circumstances, the LEA will pay for such a service to discharge its legal obligations. Legal requirements: Local education authorities must arrange for the provision of suitable education for children of compulsory school age (DfEE circular 11/99). \"Suitable\" education is defined as \"efficient education suitable to the age, ability, aptitude and to any special educational needs the child may have.\" LEAs decide what is suitable education out of school for a particular child - in consultation with parents and in line with their own policies and the efficient use of resources. Where a child is ill for up to a month, this will be the provision of work by your child's teachers, to help him or her keep up with what is being done in school. For a longer illness, a tutor may provide home tuition up to key stage 3; at key stage 4, specialist tutors may be provided to fulfil GCSE course requirements. Again, this varies from LEA to LEA. In all cases, parents should contact the school in the first instance, which should be able to put them in touch with the education welfare service in their area. Many LEAs also provide advice via a pupil support service, which can help both parents and the school. This is especially pertinent if the school has not had to deal with a long-term illness in the past and may not be aware of the full range of services available to you and your child. \u0095 The National Association for the Education of Sick Children is a charity working to improve educational opportunity for all children whose education is disrupted by illness. Free-phone 0800 027 8523 or visit: www.sickchildren.org.uk Susan Littlemore, from Parentline Plus It's entirely natural to focus all your attention upon your child and the issues surrounding their well being - but you must acknowledge the stress that this puts you under too. When a child is ill, especially for a long time, inevitably the whole family has to rearrange its home and working life. If possible, explain what has been happening to your employer, and how this is affecting you. She or he could prove to be of real support. You're bound to feel anxious when your child goes back to school, even for the occasional day - this is a transition period for you and your child, with all the incumbent worries and concerns. It's vital to talk about this - try to look beyond the immediate context of your child's illness to your own health. It may help to talk to your GP for a referral to a counsellor, or to contact your local family centre. There may be a support group that can help regarding a specific illness, or contact an advice line such as Parentline Plus. Many parents feel anger and frustration, born out of tiredness, isolation and lack of support - especially when you're at home with a sick child. Often these emotions are reflected onto the child. By seeking time and attention for yourself, you will be more able to offer such support to your child. \u0095 Parentline Plus can be contacted on freephone 0808 800 2222, or visit: www.parentlineplus.org.uk Next week's problem: My child doesn't get much physical activity. She is bogged down with homework most nights, and isn't spending much time at school doing PE or sport. What should she be doing at school, how can I get her more active, and am I right to be concerned?",

One of the WEA's earliest and most distinguished tutors, the historian R H Tawney, said that: \"The friendly smiting of weavers, potters, miners and engineers have taught me much about the problems of political and economic science which cannot be learned from books.\" </p> <p>Two out of the three words in the title are mildewed, to say the least. Workers is hardly New Labour, and we've all got to learn to call education \"learning and skills\". But the WEA's general secretary is not having the Jurassic tag: \"It would be a funny old dinosaur that is not only growing each year, but consistently over-achieves the targets given to it by the Further Education Funding Council and is more successful than ever in attracting funds from the National Lotteries Board, the European Union and the Department for International Development.\" </p> <p>Haunted by its illustrious past, however, the WEA, a voluntary movement and charitable organisation, continues to wrestle with the question of precisely what role it should play in today's lifelong learning society. In this age of quantification and targets, can its courses simply be regarded as intrinsically valuable or should they have measurable outcomes? </p> <p>Founded by Albert Mansbridge in 1903, the Association was created as an alliance between labour (working men) and learning (the universities). Its ideological roots are shared with a clutch of 19th-century initiatives, such as the mechanics institutes, the co-operative movement and popular public lectures on science, designed to slake the working classes' thirst for knowledge from which they felt excluded by the class system. </p> <p>The Association to Promote the Higher Education of Working Men, as it was first called, was formed at a conference of representatives of the trade unions, the cooperative movement and the University Extension authorities. Mary Stocks, a historian of the WEA, calculated that in 1945 fourteen members of the government were tutors, former tutors or members of the WEA executive and 56 MPs were active in the WEA either as tutors or students. At that time there were more than 800 local WEA branches. Richard Crossman was a vice-president for three years, Rab Butler for 12 and Hugh Gaitskell for 10. </p> <p>Today the WEA is divided into four organisations - two associations in Wales, one in Northern Ireland and one covering both England and Scotland. Mr Lochrie, general secretary of the English and Scottish WEA which has some 600 local branches, says there is still a very real job to be done. </p> <p>\"A very, very significant proportion of the population does not engage in lifelong learning in a structured way,\" he said. \"Our very particular job is to bring those people in, in partnership with the unions.\" He adds that the association has moved some way from providing learning for its own sake towards evaluating the benefits of its courses. A learning outcomes strategy now helps to measure the extent to which educational goals are being met. </p> <p>The WEA's work consists of three main strands. A general education programme is delivered through local branches and tutors. This involves a wide variety of provision ranging from classes in dowsing in Cornwall and west Devon, Egyptology in Blackburn, creative writing in Bury, philosophy in Cheshire to ICT courses in the east Midlands. </p> <p>The second major area of work is community learning aimed at specific groups of people with particular needs. This can involve working with the blind and others with special needs, helping to deliver return-to-learning programmes, basic skills programmes and English courses for speakers of other languages. </p> <p>In the London district a community-based creative writing project is targeted at the homeless, refugees and asylum seekers. In Yorkshire the WEA is helping economically beleaguered hill farmers find more efficient ways of running their businesses, often using computers. </p> <p>The WEA's final strand of work is its workplace learning programme where students are recruited in the workplace, via the trade unions. Such programmes are flourishing especially in Cheshire, Merseyside, west Lancashire and Scotland. The WEA works alongside unions such as Unison, the General, Municipal, and Boilermakers and others to provide programmes in communication skills, IT and literacy and numeracy initiatives. </p> <p>As a proportion of its total work the WEA's liberal education programme is falling, while work-based and community-based provision is growing. In 1998/9 it ran more than 9,000 courses. These are typically part-time and comprise 10 or 12 weekly classes, lasting two or three hours. The largest programme areas are in art, crafts, music, history, archaeology, philosophy, religion, personal development, literature, languages and communications. There are 5,000 part-time tutors in England and Scotland. </p> <p>Funded by the Further Education Funding Council as if it were a further education college, the WEA receives \u00a312m a year for its vocational and non-vocational work. All its students are part-time and 89% are aged 25 or over. The WEA is supported by hundreds of voluntary members at branch, district and national level. A Further Education Funding Council inspection report, based on an inspection conducted in March last year, praised most of its teaching for being of good quality and some of it for being outstanding. </p> <p>However, it added that provision for students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities was poor. There were also criticisms of the WEA's arrangements for assessing students' learning and of its financial planning and management. Mr Lochrie said: \"What we now do is target individuals and groups in a much more systematic way than ever before. </p> <p>\"Our student numbers are growing, but not within the traditional structures of the association, ie the local branches, or in general liberal education. Most of the work that is bringing in new students is outside the traditional programme - in the workplace and in communities.\" The WEA, he added, takes a very broad view of what lifelong learning is and of the many pathways that people can travel to get back into education and work. </p> <p>\"We ought to be bringing into lifelong learning those people who have not participated, who are educationally disadvantaged and who left school at the earliest possible age,\" he said. </p> <p>The report says that the WEA's knowledgeable and committed voluntary members are one of its major strengths. It also praises the WEA's \"clear mission, values and strategic objectives\" leading to \"successful widening of participation and significant contributions to lifelong learning.\" Ah, perhaps not quite such a dinosaur after all.</p>",

Beleaguered students have now joined the ranks of those deserving emergency food aid. </p> <p>Late October is when the realities of living away from home start to break through the euphoria of fresherdom. With wide-eyed shock, students across the land, outside the safety net of catered accommodation, are coming to the chilling realisation that cupboards and fridges do not spontaneously fill themselves. </p> <p>So, it is with impeccably good timing that food retailer Iceland has launched the Save Our Students (SOS) Survival Pack - a scheme enabling parents to shop at a distance for their provision-challenged offspring. </p> <p>The idea belongs to Ben Dutton, a 21-year-old student of Spanish and public relations at Leeds Metropolitan University.

      "bodyText": "POWs, refugees and front line troops awaiting parachute drops come to mind when you hear talk of food parcels? Well, think again. Beleaguered students have now joined the ranks of those deserving emergency food aid. Late October is when the realities of living away from home start to break through the euphoria of fresherdom. With wide-eyed shock, students across the land, outside the safety net of catered accommodation, are coming to the chilling realisation that cupboards and fridges do not spontaneously fill themselves. So, it is with impeccably good timing that food retailer Iceland has launched the Save Our Students (SOS) Survival Pack - a scheme enabling parents to shop at a distance for their provision-challenged offspring. The idea belongs to Ben Dutton, a 21-year-old student of Spanish and public relations at Leeds Metropolitan University. It was while on secondment with Iceland that he dreamed up the idea. He suggested the company should adapt their homeshopping facility to create a standard set of student supplies. These could then be ordered and paid for from a parent's address and delivered to their son's and daughter's digs. Ben's colleagues were so taken with the notion that they gave him a budget and suggested he did some research.

      "body": "<p>Hardly anyone disagrees that there is an urgent need to change the way UK universities are funded. How could they when faced with the facts? </p> <p>Public funding per student has fallen by 50% since 1980. Universities have responded by increasing productivity - we not only teach more students, but have also increased our market share of international students and raised the status of the UK science base. Nonetheless, the adverse effects of two decades of declining public funding are plain: </p> <p>\u0095 Academic salaries are low, compared with non-academic jobs and with salaries of academic staff overseas. Recruitment and retention of high quality staff is difficult and getting harder; even if they are attracted into academia, many of the most talented are easily tempted overseas. </p> <p>\u0095 Student: staff ratios have increased and average class sizes have doubled. </p> <p>\u0095 Notwithstanding the recent funding pulses via the Joint Infrastructure Fund, there has been a serious lack of capital investment over the last 20 years, especially when compared to international competitors. In 1995, the UK spent 0.7% of GDP on higher education. The OECD average was 1.5%. The US invested 2%. To increase UK expenditure to the OECD average would require additional public funding of \u00a35 bn a year. Neither government nor taxpayer are likely to make this a priority. After all, \u00a35bn a year could buy around 200,000 more teachers or 240,000 more nurses. </p> <p>No change in the status quo will also mean no funds for all-important new initiatives, such as e-learning and biotechnology developments. We will lag behind our international counterparts in these innovative and exciting areas. And if the reputation of UK higher education that attracts 200,000 international students to the UK each year is compromised we will quickly lose ground. </p> <p>The present system already falls short on other counts: </p> <p>\u0095 Although student numbers have more than doubled, universities are almost as socially exclusive today as they were 20 years ago. Just 10% of 18-year-olds from unskilled and partly skilled backgrounds enter higher education. For 18-year-olds from senior managerial and professional backgrounds, this figure is 80%. </p> <p>\u0095 The current system is incredibly inefficient. Government control over use of public funds grows ever more intrusive. This is both expensive and slows down the speed at which the system can respond to new initiatives (e-learning and biotechnology again). So a new system must not only increase funding available to universities from non-government sources, but should also reduce social exclusion and wasteful regulation and enable higher education to be more market sensitive and compete internationally. </p> <p>What is the answer?

      "bodyText": "Hardly anyone disagrees that there is an urgent need to change the way UK universities are funded. How could they when faced with the facts? Public funding per student has fallen by 50% since 1980. Universities have responded by increasing productivity - we not only teach more students, but have also increased our market share of international students and raised the status of the UK science base. Nonetheless, the adverse effects of two decades of declining public funding are plain: \u0095 Academic salaries are low, compared with non-academic jobs and with salaries of academic staff overseas. Recruitment and retention of high quality staff is difficult and getting harder; even if they are attracted into academia, many of the most talented are easily tempted overseas. \u0095 Student: staff ratios have increased and average class sizes have doubled. \u0095 Notwithstanding the recent funding pulses via the Joint Infrastructure Fund, there has been a serious lack of capital investment over the last 20 years, especially when compared to international competitors. In 1995, the UK spent 0.7% of GDP on higher education. The OECD average was 1.5%. The US invested 2%. To increase UK expenditure to the OECD average would require additional public funding of \u00a35 bn a year. Neither government nor taxpayer are likely to make this a priority. After all, \u00a35bn a year could buy around 200,000 more teachers or 240,000 more nurses. No change in the status quo will also mean no funds for all-important new initiatives, such as e-learning and biotechnology developments. We will lag behind our international counterparts in these innovative and exciting areas. And if the reputation of UK higher education that attracts 200,000 international students to the UK each year is compromised we will quickly lose ground. The present system already falls short on other counts: \u0095 Although student numbers have more than doubled, universities are almost as socially exclusive today as they were 20 years ago. Just 10% of 18-year-olds from unskilled and partly skilled backgrounds enter higher education. For 18-year-olds from senior managerial and professional backgrounds, this figure is 80%. \u0095 The current system is incredibly inefficient. Government control over use of public funds grows ever more intrusive. This is both expensive and slows down the speed at which the system can respond to new initiatives (e-learning and biotechnology again). So a new system must not only increase funding available to universities from non-government sources, but should also reduce social exclusion and wasteful regulation and enable higher education to be more market sensitive and compete internationally. What is the answer? Several options are debated in the report, Funding Universities to Meet National and International Challenges, by Professor David Greenaway and Dr Michelle Haynes (www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics/funding). But the only realistic option is to ask beneficiaries of higher education to pay more to provide it, although public money must remain a central part of the funding. Any decent state will invest in its youth. And the benefits to graduates themselves are huge. They are more likely to be employed than non-graduates, and they will earn more - on average \u00a3400,000 more than non-graduates over their working life. Enabling different universities to charge different fees for different courses, according to market demand and cost, would draw extra funding into the system. Even if the government set an upper limit on fees, the extra funding would be substantial. With, say, a fee cap of \u00a34,000, more than \u00a33bn extra would be generated each year. And the Greenaway/Haynes report suggests all universities, not just the old ones, would benefit. If students were able to contribute more by drawing on future earnings through risk-free loans to be repaid only when they could afford to, it would ensure extra income at no public cost. That is, providing the finance up front would also ensure no one was denied access because of cost. Another benefit of additional income is that universities could then start building up scholarship funds to broaden access further. Of course, these proposals need further development to ensure we increase funding and broaden access. But we cannot sit on our hands indefinitely. The competition is getting stronger all the time. \u0095 Sir Colin Campbell is vice-chancellor of Nottingham University.",

Her parents, who own a small retail business, were even willing to buy her a car so she could commute more easily. </p> <p>Her parents' fears are similar to Zhanara's. They just want their daughter to have an education, and not get involved in the university lifestyle. \"They want me at home so they can keep tabs on me.

And UCAS statistics prove it. </p> <p>\"The number of UK female students from Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani backgrounds applying to university has been steadily increasing over the past five years, generally at a rate faster than the total female population of higher education students,\" says Anthony MaClaran, deputy chief executive of UCAS. </p> <p>But the percentage of Asian females applying to university is lower than that of males. For instance, last year only 947 female students with a Bangladeshi background entered university, compared to 1,102 males from the same background. </p> <p>Figures for Pakistani and Indian students show similar discrepancies, which contradict the national trend in the gender balance of university applicants, where more females are applying than males. </p> <p>Dr Zaki Badawi, principal of the Muslim College of Britain in London, says this is bad news for the Asian community. \"Educated women are a valuable asset to society. They are essential for the family as well as the rest of society.\" </p> <p>He acknowledges that Asian parents do stop their daughters from going to university. He says it is harmful, as it prolongs the oppression of women. </p> <p>\"There's prejudice against women learning in the Asian community. It is a form of male domination,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Often the fears of daughters going astray or becoming corrupted by all sorts of influences is an excuse to hide that prejudice,\" he adds. </p> <p>Dr Badawi, who has taught Islamic studies around the world, admits that Asian parents are right in fearing the \"moral decadence\" on campuses, but says they must trust their daughters. </p> <p>\"All societies have decadence. But it is up to the individual to stay away from it.\"</p>",

And UCAS statistics prove it. \"The number of UK female students from Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani backgrounds applying to university has been steadily increasing over the past five years, generally at a rate faster than the total female population of higher education students,\" says Anthony MaClaran, deputy chief executive of UCAS. But the percentage of Asian females applying to university is lower than that of males. For instance, last year only 947 female students with a Bangladeshi background entered university, compared to 1,102 males from the same background. Figures for Pakistani and Indian students show similar discrepancies, which contradict the national trend in the gender balance of university applicants, where more females are applying than males. Dr Zaki Badawi, principal of the Muslim College of Britain in London, says this is bad news for the Asian community. \"Educated women are a valuable asset to society. They are essential for the family as well as the rest of society.\" He acknowledges that Asian parents do stop their daughters from going to university. He says it is harmful, as it prolongs the oppression of women. \"There's prejudice against women learning in the Asian community. It is a form of male domination,\" he says. \"Often the fears of daughters going astray or becoming corrupted by all sorts of influences is an excuse to hide that prejudice,\" he adds. Dr Badawi, who has taught Islamic studies around the world, admits that Asian parents are right in fearing the \"moral decadence\" on campuses, but says they must trust their daughters. \"All societies have decadence. But it is up to the individual to stay away from it.\"",

In 1997 Labour committed itself to reducing infant class sizes to a maximum of 30 by 2002. Since then, said Education Secretary David Blunkett, class sizes have indeed been shrinking: \"The number of children in classes above that level fell from a peak of 485,000 in January 1998, through 177,000 in January 2000, to stand at 30,000 at the beginning of September.\" </p> <p>Responding to critics who claim that the problem has merely shifted further up the school, he announced a \u00a373m drive to cut class sizes for 8- to 11-year-olds. </p> <p>\"This is a priority for parents,\" said Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers. \"They know that high class sizes mean less individual attention for their children.\" McAvoy's opinion is confirmed by studies of the factors influencing parents who choose a private education for their children. </p> <p>\"It is one of the top three factors in the decision,\" said a spokesman at the Independent Schools Information Service, which carried out the research. In prep schools class sizes are around 15 or 16, half the government's target figure. </p> <p>The issue of class size is so obvious to most parents and teachers that it is amazing that there should ever have been any debate. But academic research into class size has been confused and contradictory. </p> <p>\"Every teacher I've ever spoken to in the whole world would argue that a smaller class allows them to do a better job,\" says Dr Peter Blatchford at London's Institute of Education. \"But the research evidence was so puzzling as to be bizarre. Studies seemed to show that children in larger classes were doing better.\" </p> <p>Research into class size in the 50s and 60s did indeed appear to indicate that large classes were best, and an Ofsted report in 1998 argued that class size was not a factor in educational attainment. Chris Woodhead endeared himself to the profession again by arguing that it was the \"quality of the teaching\" that was critical. </p> <p>In America, the Star project in Tennessee found that children in small classes did better in reading and maths, but the research made no attempt to identify just why it was that small classes made a difference. Various states have introduced class size reduction initiatives, at huge expense, but there are academics and policy makers who think that this is money wasted. </p> <p>Not Peter Blatchford. He is directing the Class Size Research Project looking at the experience of over 10,000 very young children in schools across the UK. Blatchford dismisses the Ofsted claim and argues that earlier studies were based on poorly designed research. </p> <p>The first clear results from the project will be published next year. \"The message we are getting is very clear,\" he says. \"Children in smaller classes are making more progress in literacy and maths.\" </p> <p>It's particularly important for the weakest attainers (bottom 25%). \"They are the children who made the most progress in smaller classes.\" </p> <p>But the researchers also found differences in the classroom interaction. \"Children in smaller classes initiate more, and there's less time off task. Children in larger classes are more distracted and less engaged.\" </p> <p>Teachers at Holyhead Primary School in the West Midlands know what Blatchford means. The school serves a challenging area of Sandwell, near Birmingham, and a failed Ofsted inspection resulted in a very small intake of children three years ago. Year 3 at the school still has just 16 children. </p> <p>\"You can see the difference,\" says headteacher Hilary Bills. \"The teacher who has the small class has a fantastic year.\" </p> <p>\"There's a huge difference,\" says Year 3's teacher Simmone Edge. \"I heard the entire class read yesterday, I couldn't have done that with a class of 36.\" </p> <p>Her colleague Paul Smith has one of the larger groups. \"There's no room to move around in the class,\" he says. \"With so many children it's very difficult to have a quiet classroom. You haven't got the time during the day to go around the class on an individual basis - so they don't get the attention. If they are struggling I don't always see that as quickly as I would in a smaller class.\" </p> <p>And the differences aren't just academic. \"Teachers of very young children have an emotional involvement in seeing children develop,\" says Blatchford. \"The information we're getting is almost a cry from the heart. Teachers are saying: 'It's very difficult to do the job that I want to do when I've got 30-plus children'.\" </p> <p>Paul Smith is familiar with that sense of frustration. He entered the profession because he wanted to make a difference to children's lives, but in a large class he doesn't feel he is achieving what he could - and the workload is eroding his commitment to his chosen career. </p> <p>\"For my first two years in the job I was perfectly happy,\" he says. \"But during these last two, with the larger classes, I'd have to be honest and say that there have been times when I've asked myself 'Do I want to do this?' You have no real life in term-time, you spend most of your time trying to get ahead of the work.\" </p> <p>A recent report by Teacherline, the independent counselling helpline for teachers, reported that nearly half the country's teachers were suffering from stress, with overwork one of the most common complaints. </p> <p>\"You're sitting there until eleven o'clock at night marking maths books,\" says Hilary Bills. \"You get to the number 25 and you still have 10 more to go - it's a killer.\" </p> <p>And the problem isn't confined to teachers. Interviews by a team from a leading psychotherapy institute found \"worryingly high\" levels of stress in children. More than a quarter of those questioned said they were often or always stressed. Children said many problems were caused by school. </p> <p>\"We were surprised by the extent of the problem, particularly by the amount of stress reported by very young people,\" said Professor Stephen Palmer, from City University, London, who led the study. </p> <p>Stress for children in school can arise from bullying, poor performance, poor relationships with the teacher - all the things which teachers claim are more easily dealt with in smaller classes. </p> <p>\"One of the boys in our small class is on the autistic spectrum,\" says Hilary Bills. \"We've maintained him in mainstream, which is what his mother wants, because he's had the extra attention of a small class. In a larger group he would have been in special school by now.\" </p> <p>In a large class the child who loses out the most is often the quiet, seemingly average child, whose progress is apparently no cause for concern. \"It's very easy to overlook the quiet child,\" says Simmone Edge. \"High flyers get attention, you're very aware of children with special needs and, of course, loud noisy boys - but it's the quiet ones who lose out in a large class.\" </p> <p>Blatchford's research clearly supports the government's decision to begin the reduction of class sizes with the youngest children. He is less sure about the benefits of smaller classes for older pupils. \"The literature suggests that the biggest effects are with the youngest children,\" he says. But Tony Cooper would disagree. </p> <p>Cooper won a teachers' Oscar last month. He's head of Aldercar school near Nottingham where he has achieved phenomenal results. The past five years have seen a 231% increase in higher grades at GCSE. One of the first things Cooper did on becoming head was to reduce class sizes. </p> <p>\"There are many reasons why I thought it would work,\" he says. \"The individual attention that children get in the classroom, relationships between the teacher and 18 to 25 pupils, as opposed to 28 to 37. They get to know each other and they work together much better.\" </p> <p>But keeping classes down to 18-25 in a secondary school is expensive. Aldercar's buildings look tired and shabby. \"We could have made our buildings more attractive,\" Cooper says. \"But for \u00a320,000, which might have painted one exterior block of my school, I get another teacher.\" </p> <p>And Cooper is another voice arguing that class size has an effect beyond Sats scores and GCSE results. He strongly believes that smaller classes produce better relationships and less stress for his teachers. </p> <p>\"People do have stressful times, but in five years I've had just one member of staff off with long-term stress.\" </p> <p>His gut feelings are supported by a study into class size by the National Foundation for Educational Research which argued that the morale, motivation and self-esteem of teachers was affected by class size and that larger classes combined with classroom overcrowding had negative effects on children's behaviour. </p> <p>In short, class size is indeed the issue for schools. Real government action to reduce numbers to well below 30 would impact on a whole series of headline-inducing concerns, from teacher stress through to bullying and childhood mental health - something parents have known instinctively all along. </p> <p>\"If you went to a supermarket which checkout would you go to?\" asks Hilary Bills. \"The short queue or the long wait for a harassed checkout operator? It's exactly the same with a school.\"</p>",

It wouldn't deal with the root causes of other grievances and in the long run would cause a deterioration in quality of life. The signs are promising that Gordon Brown won't back down over fuel tax. But he must attend to the deeper separate grievances embedded in the fuel protest. Only then will the public be willing to shed their second skin - the car. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>I came to the UK from India in 1993. I had diploma in electronics and radio engineering and experience working for a highly reputable body called Indian space research organisation. I worked in system engineering and integration and earth station equipment testing department.</p> <p>But to cover my living expenses I took a machine operator's job at a hosiery factory in Leicester. I am doing the same job seven years later.</p> <p>I am bored and frustrated. I want to go back to the technical job but I am seven years out of that and my knowledge needs to be refreshed. I am 32. I am married and have two kids. </p> <p>I am confused and remain upset. I can not see my future ahead. Is there any way I can have job satisfaction. I am hard working and can work long hours.</p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>Everyone deserves job satisfaction, although some people are able to accept poor job satisfaction in return for satisfaction in other areas of their lives. For example, some mothers work in unskilled factory jobs because it enables them to pick their kids up from school and care for them - which is more important to them than job satisfaction. </p> <p>In your case, you have traded a highly satisfying job for a new life in a different country. My guess is that you have put up with the trade-off for this long, but have now reached the point where your life in the UK does not compensate for your boredom at work. In which case, I encourage you not to put up with it any longer and to take every step to gain more stimulating work. Here are some of my suggestions to help you:</p> <p>\u0095 Contact your local university or college and see if they run courses in electronics or radio engineering. Perhaps you can do a part-time (evening) degree, HND or diploma course to update your skills.</p> <p>\u0095 Contact your local university careers service and ask them what publications you would need (local papers, specialist publications, etc.) to get in order to seek out jobs in this field. Ask for any other advice. You may have to pay for this as you are not a graduate in this country.</p> <p>\u0095 Apply for jobs. You might have to accept lower pay to start with, and start at the bottom, but it should be worth it in the long run. You are still young enough to work your way up.</p> <p>\u0095 Contact employers that you have seen advertise vacancies in your chosen field or even if you just know they employ people in this field. Ask their advice - many people are only too happy to spare a few minutes to help others get a foot in the door. </p> <p>You might have to take a drop in income, or spend money in training, but the investment should reap dividends in a few years by increasing the quality of your life. </p> <p> \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).</p> <p>Advice given to this problem should only be regarded as a guide based on the limited information provided by the letter-writer. No responsibility can be taken by Dr Mann for any outcomes following advice given.</p>",

For example, some mothers work in unskilled factory jobs because it enables them to pick their kids up from school and care for them - which is more important to them than job satisfaction. In your case, you have traded a highly satisfying job for a new life in a different country. My guess is that you have put up with the trade-off for this long, but have now reached the point where your life in the UK does not compensate for your boredom at work. In which case, I encourage you not to put up with it any longer and to take every step to gain more stimulating work. Here are some of my suggestions to help you: \u0095 Contact your local university or college and see if they run courses in electronics or radio engineering. Perhaps you can do a part-time (evening) degree, HND or diploma course to update your skills. \u0095 Contact your local university careers service and ask them what publications you would need (local papers, specialist publications, etc.) to get in order to seek out jobs in this field. Ask for any other advice. You may have to pay for this as you are not a graduate in this country. \u0095 Apply for jobs. You might have to accept lower pay to start with, and start at the bottom, but it should be worth it in the long run. You are still young enough to work your way up. \u0095 Contact employers that you have seen advertise vacancies in your chosen field or even if you just know they employ people in this field. Ask their advice - many people are only too happy to spare a few minutes to help others get a foot in the door. You might have to take a drop in income, or spend money in training, but the investment should reap dividends in a few years by increasing the quality of your life. \u0095 Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).

      "body": "<p> It may have been part of the Philharmonia's Mendelssohn series, but there was no doubt where the focus lay in Wolfgang Sawallisch's concert - and it was not on Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony, in the second half of the programme. </p> <p>Before the interval, Krystian Zimerman performed that most evocative of virtuoso showpieces, Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto. On paper, this was a match made in heaven, with Zimerman's extroversion enhanced by Sawallisch's classicism, with the luxurious support of the Philharmonia. </p> <p>Yet in practice, the relationship between soloist and conductor, while built on contrast, was rather a dissonant clash of musical approaches. Where Zimerman strove to create the expressive ebb and flow that characterises his solo performances, he found himself contained by the strict boundaries of speed and articulation set by Sawallisch. </p> <p>Although the sensuous second theme of the first movement was allowed an expansive tempo, there was little of the poetic momentum the music demands. Similarly, Sawallisch's refusal to complement the spontaneity of his soloist compromised the emotional charge of the slow movement. </p> <p>Zimerman's exposed dialogues with the woodwind soloists of the orchestra were not helped by the oppressive brightness of his piano, or the unforgiving acoustics of the Royal Festival Hall. But as the cold energy of the finale demonstrated, this was an account defined by musical difference rather than creative synergy - even if the brilliance of the coda at last gave a glimpse of unity between soloist and orchestra. </p> <p>Sawallisch and the Philharmonia were on much firmer interpretative ground in Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony. Sawallisch turned the fantasy of Mendelssohn's novel structure into a single sweep of classical integrity. Yet there was real variety here, too: from the first movement's slow-burning melancholy to the unbridled round-dance of the second. Sawallisch's tour de force came in his purposeful slow movement and the lean power of his finale. The major-key coda - which can sound like one of Mendelssohn's most ill-judged inspirations - was, at Sawallisch's fleet-footed speed, the only logical conclusion to the symphony. </p> <p>Samuel Barber's ebullient School for Scandal Overture, which opened the concert, was projected with the same combination of clarity and finesse. </p>",

      "bodyText": "It may have been part of the Philharmonia's Mendelssohn series, but there was no doubt where the focus lay in Wolfgang Sawallisch's concert - and it was not on Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony, in the second half of the programme. Before the interval, Krystian Zimerman performed that most evocative of virtuoso showpieces, Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto. On paper, this was a match made in heaven, with Zimerman's extroversion enhanced by Sawallisch's classicism, with the luxurious support of the Philharmonia. Yet in practice, the relationship between soloist and conductor, while built on contrast, was rather a dissonant clash of musical approaches. Where Zimerman strove to create the expressive ebb and flow that characterises his solo performances, he found himself contained by the strict boundaries of speed and articulation set by Sawallisch. Although the sensuous second theme of the first movement was allowed an expansive tempo, there was little of the poetic momentum the music demands. Similarly, Sawallisch's refusal to complement the spontaneity of his soloist compromised the emotional charge of the slow movement. Zimerman's exposed dialogues with the woodwind soloists of the orchestra were not helped by the oppressive brightness of his piano, or the unforgiving acoustics of the Royal Festival Hall. But as the cold energy of the finale demonstrated, this was an account defined by musical difference rather than creative synergy - even if the brilliance of the coda at last gave a glimpse of unity between soloist and orchestra. Sawallisch and the Philharmonia were on much firmer interpretative ground in Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony. Sawallisch turned the fantasy of Mendelssohn's novel structure into a single sweep of classical integrity. Yet there was real variety here, too: from the first movement's slow-burning melancholy to the unbridled round-dance of the second. Sawallisch's tour de force came in his purposeful slow movement and the lean power of his finale. The major-key coda - which can sound like one of Mendelssohn's most ill-judged inspirations - was, at Sawallisch's fleet-footed speed, the only logical conclusion to the symphony. Samuel Barber's ebullient School for Scandal Overture, which opened the concert, was projected with the same combination of clarity and finesse.",
