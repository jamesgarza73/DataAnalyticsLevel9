Given its capacity for inculcating greed in young people, I'm amazed and shocked that the BBC should have been willing to publish it. </p> <p>The claim had to do with gifts alleged by Dame Joan Sutherland to have been showered on her over Christmas by her true love - identity unspecified, but presumably her husband of many years, Richard Bonynge, the distinguished conductor. Since the 12 days of Christmas had at this stage yet to begin (purists tell me they start with Boxing Day, making today the fifth of them), the events she described must have happened last year. The process, as she recalled it, began unobjectionably, as Dame Joan took delivery of a partridge in a pear tree. Subsequent days brought, in modest numbers, various species of bird: turtle doves, French hens and calling birds - all listed by Dame Joan in a tripping, insouciant manner. At this point, however, her manner changed. The next line was delivered more slowly, and much more portentously. The reason, I thought, was clear: the flow of birds had at that point dried up, and five gold rings had arrived. The calculation was clear. \"Whoopee,\" the Dame must have told herself. \"At last he's out of the aviary and into the jeweller's.\" </p> <p>But here she was wrong. On day six - New Year's Eve, and a day when last year much of the world was busy mistakenly hailing the imminent dawn of a new millennium - the supply of jewellery ceased and the flow of birds resumed with six geese a-laying, followed by seven swans swimming on New Year's Day. From here on, the arrival of presents assumed quite alarming dimensions, with eight maids a milking on Sunday, nine ladies dancing on Monday, 10 lords a-leaping (unlikely under this Labour government to have been hereditary peers) on Tuesday, 11 pipers piping on Wednesday, and finally 12 drummers drumming on Thursday, January 6. </p> <p> Similar claims, of course, have been made before, but never in my experiences with the authority of a dame of the British Empire. And never before had I realised the magnitude of what was alleged. For each item in the consignment was delivered not once but daily from its inception: the partridges, complete with their pear trees, on 12 successive days, the turtle doves on 11 and the French hens on 10. As figure one shows, the total of presents delivered had by the end reached 364: one for every day of the year except Christmas Day.</p> <p> A little further analysis revealed one of those arithmetical pleasures which cause serious mathematicians to find such tear-jerking beauty in their profession. The sequence of these deliveries takes the form of what we bookish folk call a palindrome, though I guess you might also call it a perfect parabola. The first and last arrivals will in each case have contributed 12 to the final total (that is, 12x1 partridge-in-pear-tree, 1x12 drumming drummers.) The second and the penultimate category muster 22 each (11x2 turtle doves, 2x11 pipers). The acme is reached with the geese and the swans, of whom at the end there are 42 in each case (ie 6x7 swans a swimming, and 7x6 geese a laying.) </p> <p> But that was only the start of it. As I contemplated the enormity of what Mr Bonynge had done, I began to assess its dire implications for public health and animal welfare. It is clear when you study the make-up of Dame Joan's gifts that other deliveries too must have taken place. The turtle doves will have needed a dovecote, and so on. One can easily imagine the crisis which must have occurred on day eight when the milking maids appeared on the scene. Note that Dame Joan specifies that the maids were not just milkmaids on their day off but were maids a -milking: ergo, they must have brought cows. Just how many cows is beyond my powers of computation. Ideally, there would have been eight, one for each maid. By the end of the process, though, a further 32 maids would have arrived, each presumably with a cow. A congregation like that would have needed a byre, and one very much hopes one was built to Maff specifications. </p> <p> But worse still, the maids would have needed somewhere to sleep, as would the next day's contingent, the lords; and anyone even mildly familiar with the wicked ways of the aristocracy would hope the two groups were not billeted too close together. Perhaps rooms were found for these people down the road at the Dove and Drummer; but there may at a season like this have been no room at the inn. The problem would have grown even graver when the pipers arrived. What kind of pipes they were piping is nowhere specified: we must hope that they were not bagpipes, for bagpipers have to practise, and had they insisted on doing so close to the spot where the maids and the lords were attempting to sleep (preferably, as I say, not together), the standard of performance in the milking parlour and the leaping arena next day might have left Dame Joan disappointed. Since drummers are, if anything, even noisier than pipers, it is just as well the drummers were only there for one day. </p> <p>And yet, were they? What happened to this gallimaufry of people and birds once the 12 days of Christmas were over is something of which Dame Joan neither sang nor spoke. Were they all paid off and sent home on January 7? Or do they continue to cluster around her home? And if so, are they now being joined by a further Christmas collection marshalled at the behest of Dame Joan's loving spouse? She published an autobiography in 1997, I see. Perhaps the time has come to update it.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"Rolex?\" \"No, thank you. Just some coffee and a glass of orange juice.\" \"No Rolex?\" \"No.\" \"Any other ex?\" \"Oh! Eggs.\" \"Yes! Rolled eggs. My grandmother makes them. She is from Danzig. It is very old recipe.\" </p> <p>I was in Poland for the first time in my life and was already struggling with the language. Such are the delicate nuances of pronunciation that even my attempts to learn \"Hello\" in Polish had surreal results. \"You keep saying 'father-in-law',\" explained my guide politely. </p> <p>I was in Szczecin because of Winston Churchill, who had no trouble with the pronunciation when, in a speech in Fulton, Missouri, in March 1946, he uttered the prophetic words: \"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.\" </p> <p>He used the German name Stettin because the city had been part of Prussia for 225 years. As a result of the Potsdam Treaty, it was taken from them after the second world war and handed over to Poland. Most of the German population fled and more than 100,000 dispossessed Poles from all over the country moved into their homes. </p> <p>The existence of the Iron Curtain shaped international politics for most of my life, and its almost shockingly swift destruction in 1989 only made me want to know more about it, and more particularly to put a face to the two cities Churchill chose as the limits of the new East and West. Which is why I'm here in this surprisingly handsome city on the banks of the Odra saying \"father-in-law\" to the conductor as I hop on one of the well-worn, ad-plastered, tram-cars that run through the centre of Szczecin. </p> <p>Whenever possible I prefer to approach cities by land, so I had taken a northbound express out of Berlin Ostbahnhof, which dropped me at Angermunde, where I joined a local service that ran, in disorientating November darkness, across the Mecklenburg plain and into Poland. </p> <p>Szczecin station had a neglected end-of-the-line feel to it. Its ornate old iron canopy and lovingly detailed stone work cried out for some of the money that had been lavished on the restoration of the Ostbahnhof in Berlin. </p> <p>I was put up at one of the city's newest hotels, open only three weeks. The Rondo was small, welcoming, family-run and, like almost everywhere in Szczecin, laced with recent history. Until 10 years ago, this solid German villa had been the library of the Central Party committee and the six rooms consisted of pointlessly large suites, still clearly built for committee meetings. The hotel also doubled as a language school and, as I was to find at breakfast next morning, everyone did their best to speak English. </p> <p>I was quite unprepared for the appearance of the city by daylight. As I waited for my rolled eggs, I looked out on an orderly network of tree-lined boulevards, radiating from roundabouts and flanked by four- or five-storied terraces with wrought-iron balconies and Teutonic motifs. After reaching Paris in the war of 1871, the Prussians decided they liked it very much and imported French architects and builders to re-create Paris in their own cities. </p> <p>Much of the elegance is faded and though neon signs give a surface glitter, there is no Gap and Starbucks tidiness here. There is instead the faint unease that comes from a dysfunctional recent history. As I admire the solid red granite slabs of the pavements off Grunwaldski Place, my guide Richard Jasinski points out that they were re-laid in the 1960s, sometimes with gravestones of Germans and Jews from the cemetery. </p> <p>One long, bland modern office-building, down towards the river, seems to embody all the dramatic twists and turns of Szczecin's post-war history. This was by turns Nazi, then Communist Party headquarters and in 1970 Jasinski remembers seeing it stormed and set alight by shipyard workers, protesting against food shortages. </p> <p>The insecurity of those post-war years is only slowly fading from the city. It has, after all, been little more than a decade since an unlikely alliance of workers, intellectuals and the Catholic church finally saw the communist government collapse. </p> <p>Now Szczecin is intent on putting the past behind it. The deputy mayor meets me in a bar, hands over some prints of old Stettin and regales me with news of economic progress - new roads, bridges, a regional airport. </p> <p>The great Gothic buildings high on the west bank of the Odra precede 20th century troubles. They are impressive reminders of the mercantile traditions of a city that grew rich on Baltic trade, and it is from the sea that Szczecin still makes a living. A visit to the shipyards in the north-east of the city is bittersweet for one brought up in the industrial heart of Britain. Here heavy industry survives and seems to be thriving. There are five or six huge tankers and container ships under construction, ships we in Britain can no longer afford to build. In sheds several hundred metres long welding sparks fly as steel plates are being cut like strips of cloth. Work is still hard here and wages low. The only difference now is that the yard is privately owned. </p> <p>Perhaps because of its traumatic history, I found welcome eccentricity and self-expression in Szczecin. After all, Catherine the Great, raunchiest of the tsarinas, was born here. I enjoyed a visit to one of the city's most famous poets, who is also a gynaecologist. He received me dressed like Wagner in velvet jacket, neck-scarf and floppy beret and offered me sausages and champagne while two friends sang arias from his latest opera. </p> <p>Later, at dinner in a basement restaurant called Chate Plac, they served a meat dish translated on the menu as \"pork chop of village administrator\". </p> <p> <strong>Trieste</strong> </p> <p> My Churchillian researches next took me some 530 miles south to Italy. At Venice Mestre station, I turned my back on the Serenissima and boarded the well-graffitied 14.32 electric train service which ran across the remorselessly flat fields of the Veneto before turning south and east along the limestone ridge at whose base is spread Italy's most easterly and easily forgotten city, Trieste. </p> <p>The proximity of Venice makes for invidious comparisons. Trieste is no feather-light lagoon city. The buildings I passed on the way to my hotel were big and bulky and several lanes of noisy highway separated me from the seafront. I made out tall functional buildings and stone jetties empty save for a Greek ferry looming higher than the buildings on shore, into which a seemingly endless line of trucks was being loaded. Trieste's only canal, the Canale Grande, runs for about 300 yards and could well be challenged under the Trades Descriptions Act. </p> <p>I passed a lot of people heading for the station. These were not your average commuters, more like figures from classical legend, staggering out of the gloom bearing huge loads, suitcases straining at the seams, black bags filled to bursting and piled one on top of the other on groaning trolleys. </p> <p>With some relief, I turned off the waterfront and made my way around a mighty square signposted as the Piazza Unita d'Italia. It was undergoing extensive renovation, but will be unwrapped from its protective green plastic by the summer of 2001. </p> <p>One side looks out clear toward the Adriatic. The flamboyant and imposing buildings on the three other sides have recently been cleaned. In the centre is the town hall, a rich mix of styles from mannerist to neo-classical to Venetian, and a grand art-nouveau facade on one side is matched by the neo-renaissance style of the Rossetti theatre on the other. </p> <p>No wonder people forget that Trieste is part of Italy. Its looks and style are all middle European, heavy and dripping with ornament. If Szczecin is a Polish city living in a Prussian body, then Trieste is Italian living inside an Austrian. Empress Maria Theresa plucked it from relative obscurity to make it one of a triumvirate of great cities of the Austro-Hungarian empire - Vienna was the court, Prague the administration and Trieste the seaport. Her architects built the neo-classical terraces that line the grid plan streets of the old town - the Borgo Theresiano. Impressive, but not cosy. </p> <p>Walking out next morning, I found welcome gaps in the Theresian uniformity. Turning away from the sea and heading east towards the steep slopes behind the city centre, I passed a Greek Orthodox church on my way to the old Jewish ghetto, where tall, crumbling facades confronted each other across narrow alleyways which converged on a square that reminded me briefly of the theatricality of Venice. There was a preponderance of antique shops, not the smart, intimidating kind, but full of bric-a-brac - German army helmets from the first world war, letters, diaries, collections of old newspapers. A rich social record of a cosmopolitan city. </p> <p>Walking up the hill to the plateau on which stands the 14th-century Cathedral of San Giusto and the ramparts of the castle, I paused for breath outside the Baroque church of Santa Maria Maggiore, which is cheek by jowl with the small, finely-proportioned Romanesque church of San Silvestre, from which organ music resounded. In many cities, this would be a coach-tour stop, but I was the only person there. </p> <p>Trieste is so overlaid with accretions of foreign culture that it's hard to detect any single national influence. It is as close to the rest of Italy as it is to Croatia and Slovenia. The Austrian border is 65 miles north, and a local told me that most of those I saw with bulging suitcases making their way to the station were Hungarians drawn here by the abundance and cheapness of the goods. </p> <p>Trieste's famous caf\u00e9s are grand and Viennese. The most celebrated, the Caffe San Marco, had tall ceilings, art-nouveau decoration and a collection of clich\u00e9d caf\u00e9 characters: chess players, anxious students shuffling essay papers, lovers, novelists, poets. There seemed to be room for the whole world in there and no one was hurried on. </p> <p>The diverse cultural influences and congenial pace of life have always made Trieste attractive to writers. In addition to Rilke and Italo Svevo, it was, on and off between 1904 and 1920, home to James Joyce. Exiled from narrow-minded Dublin, he found little difficulty re-creating it in Trieste. Much of his essential work on Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist and Ulysses was completed here. The city is proud of the association and there is an extensive and well-signposted Joyce trail to be followed. </p> <p>Trieste seemed optimistic, as if it were finally waking from the deep sleep into which it fell after the city was taken from the dismembered Austrian empire in 1918. It is still home to world-class writers such as Claudio Magris and Joyce expert John McCourt, while remaining the catchily-named \"insurance centre of Italy\". The mayor is the head of the Illy coffee company and his product is one of Trieste's most lucrative. </p> <p>As for the Iron Curtain, well, it was full of holes down here. Neighbouring Yugoslavia, though communist, was much less paranoid than the hardliners of the Warsaw Pact and though there were fences and barbed wire, there was also largely unrestricted movement of local people across the border. </p> <p>This perhaps accounts for why Trieste felt sleepier, more laid back than Szczecin. With less in its past to hide, it lacked the abrasive, everything-to-prove energy of the Poles. </p> <p>These two cities that Churchill plucked from relative obscurity do have considerable similarities. Both have a heavy legacy of Germanic taste and style, both have changed national identities in the last 80 years, and both have bright futures. </p> <p>Churchill foresaw the ideological partition of Europe after the second world war, and he pretty correctly judged that Szczecin and Trieste would mark the north and south extremes of this new dividing line, torn between East and West, between the free world and communism. </p> <p>Now, with the Cold War over and the Iron Curtain gone, Szczecin and Trieste are no longer at the edges of a divided continent but, potentially, at the centre of a new, united Europe. </p> <p>So, hurry. See them now, before they become like everywhere else. </p> <p><strong>Where to eat and drink</strong></p> <p><strong>Szczecin </strong></p> <p>Restaurants:</p> <p>Chate Plac<br> (Holdu Pruskiego 8, 70 -550, Tel/fax: 091 488 73 70) <br> Jolly, slightly touristy but none the worse for it really. Folksy music,but great game, and excellent northern fare such as bread and dripping and black pudding - Polish style, of course. </p> <p> Admiral<br>(Monte Cassini 37 432 28 15)<br> Best fish restaurant in Poland - and we agreed having eaten in no other fish restaurant in Poland. </p> <p> <strong>Trieste</strong></p> <p> <strong>Caf\u00e9s</strong> are a big feature of the city, and the two most famous are the <strong> Caffe San Marco</strong> (Via Battisiti) and <strong> Antico Caf\u00e9 Tommaseo</strong> (Piazza Tommaseo), which is more Viennese in style. </p> <p> Restaurants:</p> <p> Osteria da Marino<br>(Via del Ponte 5, tel: 040 366596) <br>Try the Tokay wine and lunches of mushrooms, cheese and ham which you never want to end. </p> <p><br> Enoteca Nanut<br>(Via Genova) <br>Stuffed with bottles of Italian wine. Ask the man behind the counter to recommend glasses for you to try or head out the back again for lunch and supper at wooden tables. </p> <p> <strong> How to find the Iron Curtain </strong> </p> <p>You have to go to the border of former East and West Germany, which is a five-hour drive from Szczecin.

      "bodyText": "\"Rolex?\" \"No, thank you. Just some coffee and a glass of orange juice.\" \"No Rolex?\" \"No.\" \"Any other ex?\" \"Oh! Eggs.\" \"Yes! Rolled eggs. My grandmother makes them. She is from Danzig. It is very old recipe.\" I was in Poland for the first time in my life and was already struggling with the language. Such are the delicate nuances of pronunciation that even my attempts to learn \"Hello\" in Polish had surreal results. \"You keep saying 'father-in-law',\" explained my guide politely. I was in Szczecin because of Winston Churchill, who had no trouble with the pronunciation when, in a speech in Fulton, Missouri, in March 1946, he uttered the prophetic words: \"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.\" He used the German name Stettin because the city had been part of Prussia for 225 years. As a result of the Potsdam Treaty, it was taken from them after the second world war and handed over to Poland. Most of the German population fled and more than 100,000 dispossessed Poles from all over the country moved into their homes. The existence of the Iron Curtain shaped international politics for most of my life, and its almost shockingly swift destruction in 1989 only made me want to know more about it, and more particularly to put a face to the two cities Churchill chose as the limits of the new East and West. Which is why I'm here in this surprisingly handsome city on the banks of the Odra saying \"father-in-law\" to the conductor as I hop on one of the well-worn, ad-plastered, tram-cars that run through the centre of Szczecin. Whenever possible I prefer to approach cities by land, so I had taken a northbound express out of Berlin Ostbahnhof, which dropped me at Angermunde, where I joined a local service that ran, in disorientating November darkness, across the Mecklenburg plain and into Poland. Szczecin station had a neglected end-of-the-line feel to it. Its ornate old iron canopy and lovingly detailed stone work cried out for some of the money that had been lavished on the restoration of the Ostbahnhof in Berlin. I was put up at one of the city's newest hotels, open only three weeks. The Rondo was small, welcoming, family-run and, like almost everywhere in Szczecin, laced with recent history. Until 10 years ago, this solid German villa had been the library of the Central Party committee and the six rooms consisted of pointlessly large suites, still clearly built for committee meetings. The hotel also doubled as a language school and, as I was to find at breakfast next morning, everyone did their best to speak English. I was quite unprepared for the appearance of the city by daylight. As I waited for my rolled eggs, I looked out on an orderly network of tree-lined boulevards, radiating from roundabouts and flanked by four- or five-storied terraces with wrought-iron balconies and Teutonic motifs. After reaching Paris in the war of 1871, the Prussians decided they liked it very much and imported French architects and builders to re-create Paris in their own cities. Much of the elegance is faded and though neon signs give a surface glitter, there is no Gap and Starbucks tidiness here. There is instead the faint unease that comes from a dysfunctional recent history. As I admire the solid red granite slabs of the pavements off Grunwaldski Place, my guide Richard Jasinski points out that they were re-laid in the 1960s, sometimes with gravestones of Germans and Jews from the cemetery. One long, bland modern office-building, down towards the river, seems to embody all the dramatic twists and turns of Szczecin's post-war history. This was by turns Nazi, then Communist Party headquarters and in 1970 Jasinski remembers seeing it stormed and set alight by shipyard workers, protesting against food shortages. The insecurity of those post-war years is only slowly fading from the city. It has, after all, been little more than a decade since an unlikely alliance of workers, intellectuals and the Catholic church finally saw the communist government collapse. Now Szczecin is intent on putting the past behind it. The deputy mayor meets me in a bar, hands over some prints of old Stettin and regales me with news of economic progress - new roads, bridges, a regional airport. The great Gothic buildings high on the west bank of the Odra precede 20th century troubles. They are impressive reminders of the mercantile traditions of a city that grew rich on Baltic trade, and it is from the sea that Szczecin still makes a living. A visit to the shipyards in the north-east of the city is bittersweet for one brought up in the industrial heart of Britain. Here heavy industry survives and seems to be thriving. There are five or six huge tankers and container ships under construction, ships we in Britain can no longer afford to build. In sheds several hundred metres long welding sparks fly as steel plates are being cut like strips of cloth. Work is still hard here and wages low. The only difference now is that the yard is privately owned. Perhaps because of its traumatic history, I found welcome eccentricity and self-expression in Szczecin. After all, Catherine the Great, raunchiest of the tsarinas, was born here. I enjoyed a visit to one of the city's most famous poets, who is also a gynaecologist. He received me dressed like Wagner in velvet jacket, neck-scarf and floppy beret and offered me sausages and champagne while two friends sang arias from his latest opera. Later, at dinner in a basement restaurant called Chate Plac, they served a meat dish translated on the menu as \"pork chop of village administrator\". Trieste My Churchillian researches next took me some 530 miles south to Italy. At Venice Mestre station, I turned my back on the Serenissima and boarded the well-graffitied 14.32 electric train service which ran across the remorselessly flat fields of the Veneto before turning south and east along the limestone ridge at whose base is spread Italy's most easterly and easily forgotten city, Trieste. The proximity of Venice makes for invidious comparisons. Trieste is no feather-light lagoon city. The buildings I passed on the way to my hotel were big and bulky and several lanes of noisy highway separated me from the seafront. I made out tall functional buildings and stone jetties empty save for a Greek ferry looming higher than the buildings on shore, into which a seemingly endless line of trucks was being loaded. Trieste's only canal, the Canale Grande, runs for about 300 yards and could well be challenged under the Trades Descriptions Act. I passed a lot of people heading for the station. These were not your average commuters, more like figures from classical legend, staggering out of the gloom bearing huge loads, suitcases straining at the seams, black bags filled to bursting and piled one on top of the other on groaning trolleys. With some relief, I turned off the waterfront and made my way around a mighty square signposted as the Piazza Unita d'Italia. It was undergoing extensive renovation, but will be unwrapped from its protective green plastic by the summer of 2001. One side looks out clear toward the Adriatic. The flamboyant and imposing buildings on the three other sides have recently been cleaned. In the centre is the town hall, a rich mix of styles from mannerist to neo-classical to Venetian, and a grand art-nouveau facade on one side is matched by the neo-renaissance style of the Rossetti theatre on the other. No wonder people forget that Trieste is part of Italy. Its looks and style are all middle European, heavy and dripping with ornament. If Szczecin is a Polish city living in a Prussian body, then Trieste is Italian living inside an Austrian. Empress Maria Theresa plucked it from relative obscurity to make it one of a triumvirate of great cities of the Austro-Hungarian empire - Vienna was the court, Prague the administration and Trieste the seaport. Her architects built the neo-classical terraces that line the grid plan streets of the old town - the Borgo Theresiano. Impressive, but not cosy. Walking out next morning, I found welcome gaps in the Theresian uniformity. Turning away from the sea and heading east towards the steep slopes behind the city centre, I passed a Greek Orthodox church on my way to the old Jewish ghetto, where tall, crumbling facades confronted each other across narrow alleyways which converged on a square that reminded me briefly of the theatricality of Venice. There was a preponderance of antique shops, not the smart, intimidating kind, but full of bric-a-brac - German army helmets from the first world war, letters, diaries, collections of old newspapers. A rich social record of a cosmopolitan city. Walking up the hill to the plateau on which stands the 14th-century Cathedral of San Giusto and the ramparts of the castle, I paused for breath outside the Baroque church of Santa Maria Maggiore, which is cheek by jowl with the small, finely-proportioned Romanesque church of San Silvestre, from which organ music resounded. In many cities, this would be a coach-tour stop, but I was the only person there. Trieste is so overlaid with accretions of foreign culture that it's hard to detect any single national influence. It is as close to the rest of Italy as it is to Croatia and Slovenia. The Austrian border is 65 miles north, and a local told me that most of those I saw with bulging suitcases making their way to the station were Hungarians drawn here by the abundance and cheapness of the goods. Trieste's famous caf\u00e9s are grand and Viennese. The most celebrated, the Caffe San Marco, had tall ceilings, art-nouveau decoration and a collection of clich\u00e9d caf\u00e9 characters: chess players, anxious students shuffling essay papers, lovers, novelists, poets. There seemed to be room for the whole world in there and no one was hurried on. The diverse cultural influences and congenial pace of life have always made Trieste attractive to writers. In addition to Rilke and Italo Svevo, it was, on and off between 1904 and 1920, home to James Joyce. Exiled from narrow-minded Dublin, he found little difficulty re-creating it in Trieste. Much of his essential work on Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist and Ulysses was completed here. The city is proud of the association and there is an extensive and well-signposted Joyce trail to be followed. Trieste seemed optimistic, as if it were finally waking from the deep sleep into which it fell after the city was taken from the dismembered Austrian empire in 1918. It is still home to world-class writers such as Claudio Magris and Joyce expert John McCourt, while remaining the catchily-named \"insurance centre of Italy\". The mayor is the head of the Illy coffee company and his product is one of Trieste's most lucrative. As for the Iron Curtain, well, it was full of holes down here. Neighbouring Yugoslavia, though communist, was much less paranoid than the hardliners of the Warsaw Pact and though there were fences and barbed wire, there was also largely unrestricted movement of local people across the border. This perhaps accounts for why Trieste felt sleepier, more laid back than Szczecin. With less in its past to hide, it lacked the abrasive, everything-to-prove energy of the Poles. These two cities that Churchill plucked from relative obscurity do have considerable similarities. Both have a heavy legacy of Germanic taste and style, both have changed national identities in the last 80 years, and both have bright futures. Churchill foresaw the ideological partition of Europe after the second world war, and he pretty correctly judged that Szczecin and Trieste would mark the north and south extremes of this new dividing line, torn between East and West, between the free world and communism. Now, with the Cold War over and the Iron Curtain gone, Szczecin and Trieste are no longer at the edges of a divided continent but, potentially, at the centre of a new, united Europe. So, hurry. See them now, before they become like everywhere else. Where to eat and drink Szczecin Restaurants: Chate Plac (Holdu Pruskiego 8, 70 -550, Tel/fax: 091 488 73 70) Jolly, slightly touristy but none the worse for it really. Folksy music,but great game, and excellent northern fare such as bread and dripping and black pudding - Polish style, of course. Admiral (Monte Cassini 37 432 28 15) Best fish restaurant in Poland - and we agreed having eaten in no other fish restaurant in Poland. Trieste Caf\u00e9s are a big feature of the city, and the two most famous are the Caffe San Marco (Via Battisiti) and Antico Caf\u00e9 Tommaseo (Piazza Tommaseo), which is more Viennese in style. Restaurants: Osteria da Marino (Via del Ponte 5, tel: 040 366596) Try the Tokay wine and lunches of mushrooms, cheese and ham which you never want to end. Enoteca Nanut (Via Genova) Stuffed with bottles of Italian wine. Ask the man behind the counter to recommend glasses for you to try or head out the back again for lunch and supper at wooden tables. How to find the Iron Curtain You have to go to the border of former East and West Germany, which is a five-hour drive from Szczecin. The nearest airport is Hamburg. The nearest city is L\u00fcbeck, and the border is about 10km away - the small border post will be converted into a museum next year. A good place to stay at is the Hotel Jensen am Holstentor (tel: 00 49 451 702 490/fax: 00 49 451 733 86), which costs DM160-DM 210 (\u00a350-\u00a367) for a double room.

Rising sea levels may mean that, by 2045, only the fish will enjoy the beach where you now stand. </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> January 5-26 Sydney Festival Sydney <br> </p> <p> Australia celebrates the centenary of its Federation on January 1, and the annual Sydney Arts Festival promises to be bigger and better than ever. Highlights include The Tale of the Rainbow Serpent, a fantastic parade of inflatable animals including a 15-metre snake; and, of course, the Sydney Fringe, which is as unorthodox as its Edinburgh cousin - but better because you're on the beach. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> January 19-21 Ati-Atihan Kalibo <br> </p> <p> In Australian terms, it's a short hop to Panay Island in the Philippines, where every year they hold a monumental street party called Ati-Atihan. This involves blackening your face with paint, downing plenty of rice wine and dancing for three days through the streets of Kalibo. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> January 9 - February 21 Kumbha Mela Allahabad <br> </p> <p> According to the Guinness Book of Records, Kumbha Mela in India is \"the largest number of human beings ever to assemble with a common purpose\". (This might explain why it only happens every 12 years.) Long ago, the story goes, the gods fought over a \"kumbh\" (pitcher) containing immortality. Four drops were spilled, which landed in Alla habad, Haridwar, Nasik and Ujjain. As a consequence, 15 million pilgrims come to bathe in the Ganges. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> February 22-26 Sri Lanka v England First Test Galle <br> </p> <p> It's just a short plane ride to Galle, Sri Lanka, for a celebration of another religion widely revered on the subcontinent - cricket. </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> March 1-14 Omitzutori Nara <br> </p> <p> For the past 1,200 years or so, the Todaji Temple has been the home of the Omitzutori festival, in which the monks celebrate the coming of spring by sprinting round the temple's balcony in the middle of the night, brandishing flaming torches. Considering the torches weigh 80kg and the temple is the largest wooden structure in the world, this is no mean feat. </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> March 24 Dubai World Cup <br> </p> <p> Before heading over to Europe, you've just got time to stop over in Dubai to place a bet on the world's richest horse race. The race coincides with Dubai's annual month-long shopping festival which offers top designer clothes at knock-down prices. So you can arrive in the Old World looking your very best. </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> April 1-7 Feria de Abril Seville <br></p> <p> Seville's April fair sees the area south of the river taken over by a canvas city known as the Real de la Feria, where more than a thousand brightly-coloured marquees are filled with flamenco dancers day and night. </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> April 15 Scoppio del Carro Florence <br> </p> <p> At Easter, two shards of the Holy Sepulchre brought to Florence in 1099 are used to start a fire. This lights a dove-shaped rocket known as the Colombina, which spins along a wire from the Duomo to a cart in the square below. The cart is heavily laden with fireworks; when it explodes, the city is guaranteed another year's prosperity. </p> <p><strong> 10</strong> April 20-30 Keukenhof Spring Bulbs, Lisse <br> </p> <p> Each spring also sees an explosion of colour at the leading showcase for Dutch bulb-growers - the Keukenhof Gardens in Lisse. Throughout the 70 acres of wooded parkland, some seven million flowers come into bloom - tulips, daffodils, hyacinths, Japanese cherry trees, azaleas and more. </p> <p><strong> 11</strong> May 1 May Day 'Obby 'Oss Celebrations Padstow <br> </p> <p> Every year, Padstow hails the coming of summer with a pagan procession of ale-quaffing locals accompanying a hobbyhorse who, for reasons unknown, draws hapless women under his cloak and daubs them with coal. Conveniently, and perhaps not coincidentally, the whole thing starts off in a local pub, the Golden Lion Inn. </p> <p><strong> 12</strong> May 1-31 Maison du Vin Bordeaux <br> </p> <p> The exquisite 18th-century Hotel Gobineau is home to France's Bordeaux wine school. If you ever confuse your Pomerol with your Sauternes, it might be best to take a Maison du Vin wine course to get your olfactory memory in good working order before touring the Bordeaux wine region. </p> <p><strong> 13</strong> May 9-20 Cannes Film Festival <br> </p> <p> Still the most glamorous film festival in the world. The Palais des Festivals itself is hard to get into, and your best bet for successful star-spotting is to get drinking at some of the posher bars and hotels. Cannes is notoriously expensive, though, so remember to pack a fat wallet. </p> <p><strong> 14</strong> June 10-30 White Nights St Petersburg <br> </p> <p> After the over-indulgence of Cannes, it's time to take stock in Russia's most beautiful city. June's White Nights (it never gets dark) are legendary. During the festival, locals come out to play, heading for the Marinsky theatre when the Kirov Ballet and Opera companies are at home. </p> <p><strong> 15 </strong> Anytime. Zero Gravity Flight, Star City, Russia <br> </p> <p> Have you ever wanted to be an astronaut? Well now you can. A brief 10-minute zero-gravity flight awaits you at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, a brief hop from St Petersburg. For a price, you can pretend you've just stepped into the rolling credits of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Well, it is 2001 after all. </p> <p><strong> 16</strong> July 14 Love Parade Berlin <br> </p> <p> You've come for the trucks of speakers blasting every kind of big beat music and to join the crowds who party in various states of undress. The great monuments of Berlin roll on by as your dancing feet propel you round Germany's nonconformist capital. </p> <p><strong> 17</strong> July 10-29 Lincoln Center Festival, New York City <br> </p> <p> You're just in time to catch the Lincoln Center's celebration of global artistic talent. It's innovative, funky and guaranteed to inspire. </p> <p><strong> 18</strong> August 27- September 3 Burning Man Nevada Desert <br> </p> <p> Take your own body weight in water and leave your inhibitions at home. You're joining 20,000 of California's most spun-out souls to camp in the desert of Nevada. The finale is the burning of an enormous wicker man. By that time, you'll have seen naked people driving around on sofas, built kinetic sculptures, experienced an Inipi sweat lodge workshop and partied - hard. </p> <p><strong> 19</strong> September 22-23 San Francisco Blues Festival <br> </p> <p> Take some time out to discover the joys of California, but before you go south, don't miss one of the great jazz festivals. The San Francisco Blues Festival has seen anyone who's anyone make an appearance over the past three decades. </p> <p><strong> 20</strong> Late September Dunes of Utah Kanab <br> </p> <p> Just before you leave the US for good, get back to nature with a trip to the 3,730-acre, vehicle-free Coral Pink Sand Dune State Park. </p> <p><strong> 21</strong> September 16 - October 17 Cayman Madness Diving Festival Grand Cayman <br> </p> <p> From the desert to the deep blue sea. At this time of year visibility is at its best, so dive all day (and night, too) before heading to one of many beach parties. </p> <p><strong> 22</strong> October 26-28 World Creole Music Festival, Roseau <br> </p> <p> One of the top annual Caribbean shindigs, this festival in Dominica celebrates the Caribbean Creole musical heritage. Artists play zydeco (France via Louisiana), zouk (France via Guadaloupe), soukous (Zaire via Dominica), compas (direct from Haiti) and salsa (hailing from Cuba). </p> <p><strong> 23</strong> October 31- November 2 Day of the Dead Mexico City <br> </p> <p> You might be of the opinion that hanging around in cemeteries is not cool. You'll find you're mistaken when you rock up in Mexico City's largest cemetery on the night of October 31. For the graves of the dead will be covered by picnicking relatives, children will be eating skull candy and the tequila will be flowing. The next day, amazing parades of skeletons and coffins take to the streets. </p> <p><strong> 24</strong> November 17 Leonids meteor shower <br> </p> <p> You can be anywhere in South America to see this, as long as the sky is clear and your gaze is directed into space. The shower occurs when the earth passes near the orbit of the comet Tempel-Tuttle and the dusty debris of its path hits the earth's atmosphere. Be sure to get your hands on a telescope. </p> <p><strong> 25</strong> Early November Galapagos Islands <br> </p> <p> Although the waters are not at their warmest, with a decent wet suit you may strap on your snorkelling gear and prepare for some close encounters with friendly sealions, not so friendly hammerhead sharks and what will feel like a billion fish. What's more, experience the bliss of being separated from your fellow man by a thousand miles in any direction. </p> <p><strong> 26</strong> Late November Machu Picchu Cuzco <br> </p> <p> The mountain-top city of Machu Picchu was built by the Incas. If you want to earn your view, trek for three days to the 4,200m-high pass along the 1,000-year-old Inca roads. Be sure to arrive at the Puerta del Sol in time for sunrise and when the mist clears, the sacred city will appear 1,000ft below you wrapped by a loop of the Urubamba river and backed by snowy mountains. </p> <p><strong> 27 </strong> December Los Glaciares National Park <br> </p> <p> The largest ice mantle outside the Antarctic stretches across the Patagonian ice field hiding 47 glaciers in a series of rugged mountains and glacial lakes. The Perito Moreno is a sheer wall of ice rising 200ft out of the water. Over a cycle of four years, its contours and size fluctuate (at times it's three miles wide and 22 miles long). </p> <p><strong> 28</strong> New Year's Eve Copacabana Rio de Janeiro <br> </p> <p> You've covered every continent except Africa, heard some of the best music, watched the most talented performers, tasted the finest wines, seen some wonders of the world and danced your socks off. It's time to reflect on your year - oops no, you're off to Rio to see in the year 2002 in your samba shorts on Copacabana beach, under the stars with the Atlantic ocean lapping at your feet. Perhaps it's time to fly to Kiribati again. </p> <p> \u0095 Annie Mills is head of content at whatsonwhen.com.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On my first day - ever - on the slopes, Anna, my ski instructor, introduced herself. \"Sometimes people call me the Slave Driver,\" she said. Only sometimes, Anna? Why's that? </p> <p>She had the job of teaching me how to ski at the age of 41, and her method was reminiscent of Chumbawamba: you fall down, you get up again, over and over until aching and bruised and near to tears you will yourself not to fall down any more. Well, not often. </p> <p>We'd come to \u00c5re to be initiated into the pull of the piste. The closest I'd ever got to skiing before was watching it on the telly on boring winter Sunday afternoons, cheering every fall. Allan had skied regularly before fatherhood ruled it out on grounds of time, cost and energy levels. Frankie, 15, and Rachel, 12, had barely even seen snow in their globally-warmed young lives. </p> <p>So there we were, kitted out with the requisite extraordinary paraphernalia - ankle-breaking boots, skis, poles, hats, gloves, goggles, ski pass - ready to go. Except I couldn't. With patient coaxing and a little pushing and pulling, Anna eventually positioned me at the bottom of the ski lift. At least this bit will be easy, I thought. Wrong: it took me four attempts to get the hang of gliding uphill; four humiliating crashes in front of a line of six year olds who had not only mastered the ski lift shortly after birth but had probably graduated on to the black run before starting kindergarten. </p> <p>My distress at getting up the hill was matched by my fear when I realised I'd have to ski down. Anna was a patient woman, but by the end of the first morning even she was beginning to lose it. \"Get off your butt and stay off your butt,\" she ordered me through clenched teeth. Sorry, Anna. I think she was a bit surprised to see me there on day two - and I was a bit surprised to be there. Allan had regained his ski legs pretty instantly, Rachel - after a literally wobbly start - had made huge progress with the ease of the young, and Frankie had shunned skiing for infinitely more cool snowboarding. I wasn't sure I was going to get the hang of it, even less sure I wanted to. </p> <p>But Anna wasn't going to take no for an answer. Up the lift, down the slope, over and over. I was tense (the muscles that ached the most each morning were in my neck) and terrified of going fast, of being unable to stop, of falling over again. So I did the ski equivalent of totter - it must have looked hilarious, but I was in no mood for laughing. Every time I fell, I longed to snuggle down in the snow and drift off to sleep rather than go through the hell that is regaining an upright position while wearing boots and skis. </p> <p>By the third day, I'd practically given up. Anna wanted to take Rachel off to a longer, steeper slope, and my lack of progress was clearly in the way. </p> <p>The turnaround came the next day. I asked a bus driver if he could take me from one run to another. Yes, but why don't you ski there? he asked, genuinely puzzled. Because I'm too scared to, I replied. On the 10-minute bus ride, he gently lectured me about the importance of relaxing, of not tensing every muscle in my body, of not worrying about falling and, above all, of enjoying myself, the snow, the scenery and the sensation of skiing. I got off the bus resolved to give it one last go. </p> <p>And it worked. Suddenly, I could see what it was all about, and I made more progress on that (our last) day than I had on the previous three put together. I can't pretend to be a natural skier, and I can't even pretend to be keen to do it again. But I know that next time I might even enjoy it from day one. </p> <p>I never ventured beyond the nursery slopes, although the others felt no such restriction. Allan was impressed with the snow, the slopes and the facilities, although really experienced skiers might find the slopes around \u00c5re lacking the challenge and excitement of the Alps. </p> <p>We stayed in Fjallby, a sprawling apartment-hotel with several bars, an excellent restaurant, a tiny pool and spa, within walking distance of the village centre, and only yards from the nearest ski lift. Sadly the slope it served was a little too advanced for me, and we took taxis - which came within minutes of a telephone call and weren't exorbitant - to more suitable areas. </p> <p>One of our biggest concerns had been that Sweden would be horribly expensive, but prices were not dissimilar to those in the UK, although much higher than in the southern European countries or the US where we usually take family holidays. We ate out a couple of times in \u00c5re village, spending \u00a380-\u00a390 on a meal for four with wine and soft drinks. One night we tried the restaurant at Fjallby, which served fabulous Swedish food - reindeer, elk, fish - but was alarmingly expensive: about \u00a3150 for four. </p> <p>We could have saved money by cooking for ourselves in the apartment, which was properly equipped with microwave, hob and fridge, but I can't imagine anyone who has the energy to rustle up an evening meal for four after a day's skiing. Our apartment had two tiny bedrooms with bunk beds, a sitting room/dining room/ kitchenette, two shower rooms and - best of all - lobby areas with heated cupboards where you sling all your sodden clothing and boots to dry out overnight. </p> <p>There are plenty of off-piste activities - our favourites were snowmobiling and dog-sledging. Both took us to remote parts of the mountains, where in the extraordinary stillness there was nothing apart from the odd bird and a deep sense of peace. Until the roar of the snow-mobiles or the barking of the dogs interrupted it, of course. </p> <p>On our last full day, we staggered into the village for a quiet beer. From some distance we could hear the sound of loud music, and as we turned into the main square we found ourselves unable to move for the ranks of skiers - most still in their boots - rocking to a local band playing from the back of a flat-bed lorry. The sun was beating down, the music was deafening, the crowds welcoming and friendly, and the beer flowing. For a nation that is sometimes portrayed as earnest and humourless, that crowd certainly knew how to have a good time. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Ryanair (<a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">www.ryanair.com</a>) flies London Stansted to Stockholm for \u00a339 return. </p> <p> A Sunday to Thursday package from \u00c5re Resor (00 46 647 177 00, <a href=\"http://www.iskion.com\">www.iskion.com</a>), including flights from Stockholm to Ostersund, transfers to \u00c5re and accomodation in a four-bed flat, ranges from \u00a3114pp in January to \u00a3140 in April. </p> <p> Lift passes cost \u00a318 a day or \u00a397 a week for adults, \u00a315 a day or \u00a378 a week for 8-15 year olds; children under eight free. </p> <p> Group lesson (1 hours): \u00a317 per adult; \u00a314.50 per child.

      "bodyText": "On my first day - ever - on the slopes, Anna, my ski instructor, introduced herself. \"Sometimes people call me the Slave Driver,\" she said. Only sometimes, Anna? Why's that? She had the job of teaching me how to ski at the age of 41, and her method was reminiscent of Chumbawamba: you fall down, you get up again, over and over until aching and bruised and near to tears you will yourself not to fall down any more. Well, not often. We'd come to \u00c5re to be initiated into the pull of the piste. The closest I'd ever got to skiing before was watching it on the telly on boring winter Sunday afternoons, cheering every fall. Allan had skied regularly before fatherhood ruled it out on grounds of time, cost and energy levels. Frankie, 15, and Rachel, 12, had barely even seen snow in their globally-warmed young lives. So there we were, kitted out with the requisite extraordinary paraphernalia - ankle-breaking boots, skis, poles, hats, gloves, goggles, ski pass - ready to go. Except I couldn't. With patient coaxing and a little pushing and pulling, Anna eventually positioned me at the bottom of the ski lift. At least this bit will be easy, I thought. Wrong: it took me four attempts to get the hang of gliding uphill; four humiliating crashes in front of a line of six year olds who had not only mastered the ski lift shortly after birth but had probably graduated on to the black run before starting kindergarten. My distress at getting up the hill was matched by my fear when I realised I'd have to ski down. Anna was a patient woman, but by the end of the first morning even she was beginning to lose it. \"Get off your butt and stay off your butt,\" she ordered me through clenched teeth. Sorry, Anna. I think she was a bit surprised to see me there on day two - and I was a bit surprised to be there. Allan had regained his ski legs pretty instantly, Rachel - after a literally wobbly start - had made huge progress with the ease of the young, and Frankie had shunned skiing for infinitely more cool snowboarding. I wasn't sure I was going to get the hang of it, even less sure I wanted to. But Anna wasn't going to take no for an answer. Up the lift, down the slope, over and over. I was tense (the muscles that ached the most each morning were in my neck) and terrified of going fast, of being unable to stop, of falling over again. So I did the ski equivalent of totter - it must have looked hilarious, but I was in no mood for laughing. Every time I fell, I longed to snuggle down in the snow and drift off to sleep rather than go through the hell that is regaining an upright position while wearing boots and skis. By the third day, I'd practically given up. Anna wanted to take Rachel off to a longer, steeper slope, and my lack of progress was clearly in the way. The turnaround came the next day. I asked a bus driver if he could take me from one run to another. Yes, but why don't you ski there? he asked, genuinely puzzled. Because I'm too scared to, I replied. On the 10-minute bus ride, he gently lectured me about the importance of relaxing, of not tensing every muscle in my body, of not worrying about falling and, above all, of enjoying myself, the snow, the scenery and the sensation of skiing. I got off the bus resolved to give it one last go. And it worked. Suddenly, I could see what it was all about, and I made more progress on that (our last) day than I had on the previous three put together. I can't pretend to be a natural skier, and I can't even pretend to be keen to do it again. But I know that next time I might even enjoy it from day one. I never ventured beyond the nursery slopes, although the others felt no such restriction. Allan was impressed with the snow, the slopes and the facilities, although really experienced skiers might find the slopes around \u00c5re lacking the challenge and excitement of the Alps. We stayed in Fjallby, a sprawling apartment-hotel with several bars, an excellent restaurant, a tiny pool and spa, within walking distance of the village centre, and only yards from the nearest ski lift. Sadly the slope it served was a little too advanced for me, and we took taxis - which came within minutes of a telephone call and weren't exorbitant - to more suitable areas.

There are plenty of off-piste activities - our favourites were snowmobiling and dog-sledging. Both took us to remote parts of the mountains, where in the extraordinary stillness there was nothing apart from the odd bird and a deep sense of peace.

      "body": "<p>The Nevis Highwire bungy jump is very, very high - 134 metres, or 439 feet, if you prefer. That's around eight seconds of falling. Eight very, very long seconds. </p> <p>You don't jump from a platform or a bridge, as you do with more civilised bungies (though civilised and bungy are not words that really go together). You jump from a pod suspended by cables over the Nevis gorge. It's not a friendly place; the cliffs are dark and threatening, and the river way down at the bottom looks rocky and mean. You reach the pod in a small, steel cage, feeling as if you're going to your own execution. </p> <p>The dead man walking theme continues inside the pod, where the executioner sits you in a chair and ties straps to your legs. There isn't a priest, but there should be. It's a wild place - a little box full of fear, adrenalin, speed, metal and testosterone, hanging over a canyon. There are two kinds of people in there: the ones who haven't jumped and are sitting quietly in their own little worlds; and the ones who have - high-fiving or shouting \"awesome\" and \"fuck\", or simply grinning and looking as if they've just met Jesus for the first time. </p> <p>Next, the executioner orders you to stand by the edge of the open door. It's best not to look down at this point. I saw an Irishman throw up when he looked down; he bottled it and went back into the cage in shame, only his breakfast having made the leap. But that's rare. Most people who've got this far don't go back. There's a brief countdown. And then, even though everything in your body is telling you not to, you jump. </p> <p>You then enter a wholly different world. There is no gravity because you're falling with it, accelerating headfirst past the dark cliffs towards the rocky canyon floor, your internal organs floating all over the place, and about eight litres of adrenalin pumping around your body. It's both joyous and terrifying, and lasts pretty much for ever. But then the bungy comes into action and your eyeballs are pushed forward in their sockets. From then on, when you know you haven't died, it's the best thing you've ever done. </p> <p>Apparently. I mean, that's what the guys I talked to said. Me? No, I didn't do a jump myself. Didn't even get as close as the Irishman in fact. As soon as I saw the Nevis Highwire, I knew I wasn't going to do it. </p> <p>\"The main reason we built the Nevis is that we wanted to take the whole thing to another level,\" said Henry van Asch, the bungy pioneer responsible for it. \"I don't think of it as a sport, but a challenge. It's a metaphysical personal challenge.\" </p> <p>A metaphysical personal challenge I failed very convincingly. Henry's done all right out of throwing people from high heights; he now has a vineyard and a fleet of flash cars. He took me to the Kawarau Bridge, a baby jump of only 140ft, but I still wasn't tempted. It was from here that Zara Philips made her well-publicised jump, and it sounds like she was effing and blinding like everyone else right after her jump. \"She was one of the most foul-mouthed people we ever had here,\" said van Asch. </p> <p>This is Queenstown in New Zealand's South Island, the centre of all things to do with adrenalin. If it's not bungying, then it's jetboating, white-water rafting, quad-biking, river surfing, hang-gliding, heliskiing, or flying by wire. </p> <p>I never even found out what flying by wire means. Instead, I took a gentle walk up the lovely Routeburn Valley, enjoying the snowy peaks, the flat grassy glacial valleys, the wild lupins, the beech forests and the clearest and most delicious water in the world. Not a drop of adrenalin around. </p> <p>Over in Dunedin, I discovered an even more leisurely, but equally enjoyable pursuit: penguin watching. Eric the penguin man took me in his van before dawn. As we drove along, Eric warned me what to watch out for on the beach - a couple of quite feisty female hooker sealions, and an aggressive male whose testicles hadn't quite dropped yet - \"so he's having a bit of a testosterone surge\". Send him to the Nevis Highwire, I thought, that should make them drop. </p> <p>We crept past the hookers on the beach and waited for the penguins. As soon as the eastern sky began to light up, out they came. Yellow-eyed penguins - they spend the nights in the grassy hills and shuffle down in the morning to go fishing. We watched them coming down the hills, often in pairs, doing their funny penguin walk. </p> <p>On reaching the beach, they'd check up and down for danger, then break into a trot across the wet sand before diving in to the icy breakers to contend with more sealions, sharks, and killer whales. I hope they all made it back that evening, because a yellow-eyed penguin is a wonderful thing. </p> <p>As are the royal albatrosses that nest at Taiaroa Head, at the end of the sound. Clumsy on land, as soon as they're in the air, they're the most majestic of creatures, and every bird the soul of a drowned sailor. </p> <p>Stewart Island is south of the South Island - next stop Antarctica. It's a stormy, gloomy, romantic place, and it rains 275 days a year. To get there we flew over the boiling waters of the Foveaux Strait and landed on Mason Bay, where the winds of the roaring forties turn the beach into a giant sandblaster. We walked inland, through the sand dunes, to a landscape of huge shadowy hills, bogs and coloured scrub, to spend the night in an old farmhouse and read the ranger's diary from 20 years ago. It seems it was a sad existence, being a ranger alone in the middle of Stewart Island, and didn't attract the brightest people. \"Counted sheep today. Approximately seven,\" said one day's entry. Another day simply read: \"Put down kittens.\" No one farms on Stewart Island any more - it's just too much effort for too little return. </p> <p>At night we went out to look for kiwis, without success. But the following day, walking over the island to freshwater river, we saw one in the manuka bushes beside the path. They're funny things, kiwis - like big hedgehogs with bird bits sticking out, and they snuffle around with their heads to the ground. They're a dying breed, too, being killed off by the rats, dogs, and stoats introduced by Europeans. </p> <p>The main town of Stewart Island is Oban, population a little under 400. There used to be more people, but like New Zealand as a whole, people are upping and leaving. Two hundred people leave New Zealand every day. There are plenty of people in Oban's pub, though, the pub with a jukebox with nothing much post 1975 on it. A row of men with big beards and pints of Speight's Old Dark nod along to Genesis at the bar. Very big beards - it's like a competition to see who has the most facial hair. And the winner is Sam Sampson; an albatross could nest in that beard, Sam. </p> <p>Sam does tours of Oban in his bus. His voice is so singsong that \"yeah\" has at least four syllables, and he delivers his monologue as he drives. That's where the publican who drowned used to live. Here's the golf course. \"That's the sixth hole there. The sixth hole is also the last hole.\" </p> <p>I ate my first mutton bird in Oban. My first and last. If anyone asks you round for mutton bird, you're busy - that's my advice. It's like a cross between venison and extra strength kipper, with added fat: horrid. But I loved Stewart Island, in spite of its sadness. Sweet as, as they say round here. Much better than any bungy jump anyway (yeah right, like I'd know). </p> <p>I thought I'd escaped bungies and adrenalin, but that's hard in New Zealand. There's something about the place that makes people want to catapult themselves violently about the place. In downtown Auckland, on the way through, just when I thought I was safely away from any temptation to scare myself senseless, I came across the Sky Screamer. A terrifying-looking contraption, it promised: \"Twice the ride of a bungy. Experience 5gs. Max adrenalin rush. 200kmh in two seconds.\" As if that were a good thing. I don't know if it was another personal metaphysical challenge, but if it was, it was one I was happy to fail once again. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Air New Zealand (020-8741 2299, <a href=\"http://www.airnewzealand.com\">www.airnewzealand.com</a>) flies daily from London Heathrow to New Zealand, via LA.

If Posh and Becks think they can hardly move without the world knowing, they should consider life back home for Bagheri. </p> <p>The day he found thousands of people gathered outside his house in Tabriz was just for starters. As the 26-year-old recounts the chaos caused by his trip to a market for the Iranian new year, it is hard not to smile. \"One minute I was choosing my fish,\" he says, \"and the next thing I turned round and there were hundreds and hundreds of people. Someone had noticed me, word had got round and they were coming up to me, asking for autographs, pushing and shoving just to touch me or shake my hand. The fanaticism is amazing. </p> <p>\"It's not such a problem when I go to a restaurant because the crowds can be controlled, but when I go shopping it can be difficult, particularly if I go with my family.

      "bodyText": "Karim Bagheri does not have his wife and young son's names tattooed on his body but when it comes to national profile Charlton's Iranian import is very much a David Beckham. If Posh and Becks think they can hardly move without the world knowing, they should consider life back home for Bagheri. The day he found thousands of people gathered outside his house in Tabriz was just for starters. As the 26-year-old recounts the chaos caused by his trip to a market for the Iranian new year, it is hard not to smile. \"One minute I was choosing my fish,\" he says, \"and the next thing I turned round and there were hundreds and hundreds of people. Someone had noticed me, word had got round and they were coming up to me, asking for autographs, pushing and shoving just to touch me or shake my hand. The fanaticism is amazing. \"It's not such a problem when I go to a restaurant because the crowds can be controlled, but when I go shopping it can be difficult, particularly if I go with my family. As a result I don't tend to go out often. It's not that the fans are bad, it's just that they love the game and the players so much.\" So far Bagheri has had a lower profile than he might have liked at the Valley.

      "byline": "Jon Ronson",

      "body": "<p>Unfortunately, Armageddon had already arrived in the form of tornadoes and floods. It felt like Armageddon for a while, it really did. The country was tired and wet and immobile and beginning to believe that there might, after all, be a relationship between fuel consumption and global warming. They couldn't muster up much sympathy for the new Jarrow crusaders, who were, in truth, nothing like the old Jarrow crusaders. \"Let's get something straight,\" began a letter in the Newcastle Journal. \"The Jarrow marchers were starving. Seen any poor hauliers lately? Ever counted the number of four-wheel drives at foxhunts and county shows? In the churchyards of South Tyneside, some dear, brave souls will surely be spinning in their graves.\"</p> <p>Michael Meacher's department grabbed the opportunity to remind the public that: \"It is remarkable that during the recent fuel crisis hardly anyone mentioned the environment.\" But then added, a little confusingly, that we were experiencing the worst storms since 1947. So perhaps it wasn't global warming. And in the midst of this, on October 17, the 12.10 GNER King's Cross to Leeds train fell off its track - and the rail system collapsed. \"Nobody move,\" screamed a guard. \"Stay in the carriage. I repeat, nobody move.\" </p> <p> But, of course, people did move. There were missing laptops to be found, loved ones to telephone. Eyewitness accounts printed in the following day's papers could have been taken from the cuttings library, they have become so familiar. A woman in a pressed white shirt cradles a member of the train's crew whose forearm is seared and raw. A man in an expensive suit clutches a mobile phone to his bleeding ear. The fire brigade arrives at the same time as a group of schoolboys, jeering and sniggering on the road below. Railtrack puts up posters saying that sorry wasn't enough. In the chaos that followed, rail operators offered some commuters \u00a37 compensation. Other passengers, held in sidings for up to eight hours, were offered one free item each from the buffet car.</p> <p>In September, Blair told the Reader's Digest that he'd give it all up for his children. This seemed like a genuine and honourable claim. He guarded their privacy with an obsession that was understandable, yet seemingly exaggerated given the tone of the coverage they received. The press could not have been less critical when Euan Blair was discovered slumped outside the Odeon, Leicester Square: \"Good for you, kid,\" summed up the Mirror. \"He had a few beers and ended up face down. Thank God for that. Euan's behaviour seems a damned sight more normal than the glazed grin his parents wear in public.\"</p> <p>The birth of Leo, too, was greeted with a reverence reminiscent of the old days of clipped BBC announcers and courteous newspaper proprietors. Mystic Meg predicted in the News of the World that the baby will grow up to be a \"worldwide pop sensation or midfield soccer ace\". Nonetheless, when the Northern Echo published a photo of Leo taken by a teacher on a Blair family visit to a local school, Downing Street treated it as if a paparazzo had climbed a drainpipe and snuck into the nursery.</p> <p>Rarely in 2000 did the prime minister's face flash with such sincerity and conviction in political matters. Until, that is, Lady Thatcher labelled his endorsement of the proposed European rapid reaction force a \"monumental folly\". Blair's anger was invigorating: \"It really is time that we move British politics beyond the time of Margaret Thatcher,\" he said, adding that the Daily Mail's coverage was \"quite disgraceful and totally unwarranted\".</p> <p>By December, New Labour was buoyant again, 10 points ahead in the opinion polls. Blair's terrible summer - crystallised by Livingstone's landslide in the mayoral elections, the stinging slow handclap to his speech from members of the Women's Institute, and the claims that both he and Gordon Brown lied about Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m donation to party funds - seemed more distant, less fatal, thanks partly to a little help from Ann Widdecombe. Her call at the Tory party conference for zero tolerance of cannabis users reminded the country of the insanity at the heart of the shadow cabinet. Seven top Tories immediately confessed to smoking cannabis while at university (they all found it disagreeable and never did it again - surprise, surprise), but Widdecombe did not stop there. Zero tolerance, she explained, was not aimed at \"educated, articulate people\" but at \"housing estates\". Suddenly, Lord Falconer's apology back in January to the \"VIPs and the ordinary people\" did not seem quite so bad.</p> <p> On September 24, eight million people turned up to vote in the Serbian elections. Slobodan Milosevic lost the popular vote by around 100,000. He refused to step down. He blamed his election defeat on the New World Order, a shadowy elite of internationalists bent on establishing an all-powerful world government. His views were widely derided. </p> <p>On November 27, a CCTV camera caught a 10-year-old boy called Damilola Taylor skipping home from his computer club through a Peckham estate. He skipped out of shot. Then he was stabbed in the leg with a broken bottle. He bled to death in his school uniform in a urine-stained stairwell. Some passers-by tried to stem the flow of blood, but others ran away, considering the sight of a dying child - blood flowing like a fountain from his leg - to be too horrible to witness. \"The Boy Who Came Here For A Better Way Of Life,\" headlined the Daily Mail, making no reference to the fact that, a month earlier, the paper had sternly called for \"tough action from Jack Straw to quell fears that Britain is a soft touch for economic migrants seeking a better life here\".</p> <p> William Hague assured Britain's racists that he was fully aware that \"a disproportionate number of street crimes are being committed by black young men\". He stopped just a hair's breath short of blaming Jack Straw and the Macpherson report for the murder - for falsely accusing the British police force of being racist and consequently bringing about the decline in police numbers. </p> <p>In the US elections, the first televised debate of the presidential campaign was declared a draw by American commentators. \"Al Gore may have the experience and most of the issues on his side,\" wrote a New York Times columnist, \"but he can't keep his superciliousness in check. Earth to Al Gore: this turns people off.\" The paper also accused Gore of \"showing off\" for correctly pronouncing the name \"Slobodan Milosevic\" and reproached him for \"digressing to explain things\". George W Bush, meanwhile, was judged to have been stupid in an endearing way. </p> <p> Gore took the criticism to heart. He changed tack. No longer would aptitude be a factor in his campaign. Instead, he pledged to \"rip the lungs\" out of his enemies should America choose to elect him. It was hilarious to watch the spawn of these two old billionaire elitist families ingratiate themselves with the underprivileged. Gore all but blacked-up for the southern states, twanging like a banjo at an old-time revival, comparing his opponent to the ol' Devil himself. Bush, meanwhile, in one of his less publicised gaffes, told America's poor: \"I know how hard it is to put food on your family.\"</p> <p> Bush enthusiastically promoted himself as lazy and careless - his long lie-ins, his inability to pronounce the word \"subliminal\", his declaration that Texas had never executed a \"guilty ... I mean innocent man\". Although he had only travelled outside the US on three occasions, he rousingly stated: \"The fundamental question is, 'Will I be a successful president when it comes to foreign policy?' I will be, but until I'm the president, it's going to be hard for me to verify that I think I'll be more effective.\" He was clearly pitching himself as the president for the people who didn't want a president. The nihilistic voter was enamoured. On election night, a jubilant Bush declared, \"They misunderestimated me!\"</p> <p> And then all hell broke loose. In Palm Beach, Florida, an estimated 6,000 Jewish retirees were confused by lousy ballot design into inadvertently voting for the rightwinger Pat Buchanan. All over Florida, black voters - 90% of whom were Gore supporters - complained of intimidation by the police on their way to the polling stations.</p> <p>For all the Supreme Court chaos that followed, the decisive moment came in the early afternoon of November 22. A group of demonstrators, posing as tourists on their way to Miami Seaquarium, stormed the Stephen P Clark Government Centre where the hand recounts were in full swing. It was clear that Gore would win the election should the counts continue. So the mob stopped the counts. According to the Wall Street Journal, Bush even telephoned to \"offer encouragement to those who had physically intimidated the Dade County canvassing board before it abruptly reversed its decision to count disputed ballots and instead cast those 10,750 ballots aside\".</p> <p>When Miami-Dade Democratic chairman Joe Geller walked out of the counting room with a sample ballot, the crowd accused him of stealing a real one. Geller was pushed by two dozen protesters screaming, \"I'm gonna take you down!\" Democrat bystanders were punched and kicked. The protesters included 150 Republican supporters who had been offered $30 a day and invitations to a VIP Thanksgiving party in Fort Lauderdale.</p> <p>Two hours later, the canvassing board voted to shut down the count. The Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris - who was outed on the Democrat party website as the girlfriend of Bush's brother, Jeb - said, \"The true winner is the rule of law. Thank you and may God bless America.\"</p> <p>\"Now,\" Bush added, \"we must live up to our principles. We must show our commitment to the common good, which is bigger than any person or any party. The end of an election is the beginning of a new day. Together we can make this a positive day of hope and opportunity for all of us who are blessed to be Americans.\" It was appropriate that - in this year of the mob - American democracy collapsed in this fashion</p> <p> <strong>Products we won't miss</strong><br></p> <p>A dog lead designed by Gucci with silver squares spelling 'Gucci dog' on a black leather collar (price: \u00a3220). </p> <p>Taebo - an exercise mish-mash of martial arts, aerobics and circuit training (Pamela Anderson, a prime exponent). </p> <p>Play With The Teletubbies - brain-melt videogame for PlayStation. </p> <p>Naked quiz programmes on Channel 5 (and Keith Chegwin, for that matter). </p> <p>Pok\u00e9mon cards: children were obsessed by Pikachu and his 149 friends.

      "bodyText": "Unfortunately, Armageddon had already arrived in the form of tornadoes and floods. It felt like Armageddon for a while, it really did. The country was tired and wet and immobile and beginning to believe that there might, after all, be a relationship between fuel consumption and global warming. They couldn't muster up much sympathy for the new Jarrow crusaders, who were, in truth, nothing like the old Jarrow crusaders. \"Let's get something straight,\" began a letter in the Newcastle Journal. \"The Jarrow marchers were starving. Seen any poor hauliers lately? Ever counted the number of four-wheel drives at foxhunts and county shows? In the churchyards of South Tyneside, some dear, brave souls will surely be spinning in their graves.\" Michael Meacher's department grabbed the opportunity to remind the public that: \"It is remarkable that during the recent fuel crisis hardly anyone mentioned the environment.\" But then added, a little confusingly, that we were experiencing the worst storms since 1947. So perhaps it wasn't global warming. And in the midst of this, on October 17, the 12.10 GNER King's Cross to Leeds train fell off its track - and the rail system collapsed. \"Nobody move,\" screamed a guard. \"Stay in the carriage. I repeat, nobody move.\" But, of course, people did move. There were missing laptops to be found, loved ones to telephone. Eyewitness accounts printed in the following day's papers could have been taken from the cuttings library, they have become so familiar. A woman in a pressed white shirt cradles a member of the train's crew whose forearm is seared and raw. A man in an expensive suit clutches a mobile phone to his bleeding ear. The fire brigade arrives at the same time as a group of schoolboys, jeering and sniggering on the road below. Railtrack puts up posters saying that sorry wasn't enough. In the chaos that followed, rail operators offered some commuters \u00a37 compensation. Other passengers, held in sidings for up to eight hours, were offered one free item each from the buffet car. In September, Blair told the Reader's Digest that he'd give it all up for his children. This seemed like a genuine and honourable claim. He guarded their privacy with an obsession that was understandable, yet seemingly exaggerated given the tone of the coverage they received. The press could not have been less critical when Euan Blair was discovered slumped outside the Odeon, Leicester Square: \"Good for you, kid,\" summed up the Mirror. \"He had a few beers and ended up face down. Thank God for that. Euan's behaviour seems a damned sight more normal than the glazed grin his parents wear in public.\" The birth of Leo, too, was greeted with a reverence reminiscent of the old days of clipped BBC announcers and courteous newspaper proprietors. Mystic Meg predicted in the News of the World that the baby will grow up to be a \"worldwide pop sensation or midfield soccer ace\". Nonetheless, when the Northern Echo published a photo of Leo taken by a teacher on a Blair family visit to a local school, Downing Street treated it as if a paparazzo had climbed a drainpipe and snuck into the nursery. Rarely in 2000 did the prime minister's face flash with such sincerity and conviction in political matters. Until, that is, Lady Thatcher labelled his endorsement of the proposed European rapid reaction force a \"monumental folly\". Blair's anger was invigorating: \"It really is time that we move British politics beyond the time of Margaret Thatcher,\" he said, adding that the Daily Mail's coverage was \"quite disgraceful and totally unwarranted\". By December, New Labour was buoyant again, 10 points ahead in the opinion polls. Blair's terrible summer - crystallised by Livingstone's landslide in the mayoral elections, the stinging slow handclap to his speech from members of the Women's Institute, and the claims that both he and Gordon Brown lied about Bernie Ecclestone's \u00a31m donation to party funds - seemed more distant, less fatal, thanks partly to a little help from Ann Widdecombe. Her call at the Tory party conference for zero tolerance of cannabis users reminded the country of the insanity at the heart of the shadow cabinet. Seven top Tories immediately confessed to smoking cannabis while at university (they all found it disagreeable and never did it again - surprise, surprise), but Widdecombe did not stop there. Zero tolerance, she explained, was not aimed at \"educated, articulate people\" but at \"housing estates\". Suddenly, Lord Falconer's apology back in January to the \"VIPs and the ordinary people\" did not seem quite so bad. On September 24, eight million people turned up to vote in the Serbian elections. Slobodan Milosevic lost the popular vote by around 100,000. He refused to step down. He blamed his election defeat on the New World Order, a shadowy elite of internationalists bent on establishing an all-powerful world government. His views were widely derided. On November 27, a CCTV camera caught a 10-year-old boy called Damilola Taylor skipping home from his computer club through a Peckham estate. He skipped out of shot. Then he was stabbed in the leg with a broken bottle. He bled to death in his school uniform in a urine-stained stairwell. Some passers-by tried to stem the flow of blood, but others ran away, considering the sight of a dying child - blood flowing like a fountain from his leg - to be too horrible to witness. \"The Boy Who Came Here For A Better Way Of Life,\" headlined the Daily Mail, making no reference to the fact that, a month earlier, the paper had sternly called for \"tough action from Jack Straw to quell fears that Britain is a soft touch for economic migrants seeking a better life here\". William Hague assured Britain's racists that he was fully aware that \"a disproportionate number of street crimes are being committed by black young men\". He stopped just a hair's breath short of blaming Jack Straw and the Macpherson report for the murder - for falsely accusing the British police force of being racist and consequently bringing about the decline in police numbers. In the US elections, the first televised debate of the presidential campaign was declared a draw by American commentators. \"Al Gore may have the experience and most of the issues on his side,\" wrote a New York Times columnist, \"but he can't keep his superciliousness in check. Earth to Al Gore: this turns people off.\" The paper also accused Gore of \"showing off\" for correctly pronouncing the name \"Slobodan Milosevic\" and reproached him for \"digressing to explain things\". George W Bush, meanwhile, was judged to have been stupid in an endearing way. Gore took the criticism to heart. He changed tack. No longer would aptitude be a factor in his campaign. Instead, he pledged to \"rip the lungs\" out of his enemies should America choose to elect him. It was hilarious to watch the spawn of these two old billionaire elitist families ingratiate themselves with the underprivileged. Gore all but blacked-up for the southern states, twanging like a banjo at an old-time revival, comparing his opponent to the ol' Devil himself. Bush, meanwhile, in one of his less publicised gaffes, told America's poor: \"I know how hard it is to put food on your family.\" Bush enthusiastically promoted himself as lazy and careless - his long lie-ins, his inability to pronounce the word \"subliminal\", his declaration that Texas had never executed a \"guilty ... I mean innocent man\". Although he had only travelled outside the US on three occasions, he rousingly stated: \"The fundamental question is, 'Will I be a successful president when it comes to foreign policy?' I will be, but until I'm the president, it's going to be hard for me to verify that I think I'll be more effective.\" He was clearly pitching himself as the president for the people who didn't want a president. The nihilistic voter was enamoured. On election night, a jubilant Bush declared, \"They misunderestimated me!\" And then all hell broke loose. In Palm Beach, Florida, an estimated 6,000 Jewish retirees were confused by lousy ballot design into inadvertently voting for the rightwinger Pat Buchanan. All over Florida, black voters - 90% of whom were Gore supporters - complained of intimidation by the police on their way to the polling stations. For all the Supreme Court chaos that followed, the decisive moment came in the early afternoon of November 22. A group of demonstrators, posing as tourists on their way to Miami Seaquarium, stormed the Stephen P Clark Government Centre where the hand recounts were in full swing. It was clear that Gore would win the election should the counts continue. So the mob stopped the counts. According to the Wall Street Journal, Bush even telephoned to \"offer encouragement to those who had physically intimidated the Dade County canvassing board before it abruptly reversed its decision to count disputed ballots and instead cast those 10,750 ballots aside\". When Miami-Dade Democratic chairman Joe Geller walked out of the counting room with a sample ballot, the crowd accused him of stealing a real one. Geller was pushed by two dozen protesters screaming, \"I'm gonna take you down!\" Democrat bystanders were punched and kicked. The protesters included 150 Republican supporters who had been offered $30 a day and invitations to a VIP Thanksgiving party in Fort Lauderdale. Two hours later, the canvassing board voted to shut down the count. The Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris - who was outed on the Democrat party website as the girlfriend of Bush's brother, Jeb - said, \"The true winner is the rule of law. Thank you and may God bless America.\" \"Now,\" Bush added, \"we must live up to our principles. We must show our commitment to the common good, which is bigger than any person or any party. The end of an election is the beginning of a new day. Together we can make this a positive day of hope and opportunity for all of us who are blessed to be Americans.\" It was appropriate that - in this year of the mob - American democracy collapsed in this fashion Products we won't miss A dog lead designed by Gucci with silver squares spelling 'Gucci dog' on a black leather collar (price: \u00a3220). Taebo - an exercise mish-mash of martial arts, aerobics and circuit training (Pamela Anderson, a prime exponent). Play With The Teletubbies - brain-melt videogame for PlayStation. Naked quiz programmes on Channel 5 (and Keith Chegwin, for that matter). Pok\u00e9mon cards: children were obsessed by Pikachu and his 149 friends. Boys, especially, spent all their money on cards; if, like two 13-year-olds in Swindon, they hadn't saved enough, they stole them. The All Saints movie, Honest, seen by almost no one, despite a glitzy Cannespremiere. The Manchester United megastore, where you can buy lampshades, mobile phones, three-dimensional Goal Mouth Alarm Clocks, and just about anything else you don't need, with the United emblem. New Era: There Is Life After Marriage and Divorce Magazine - two magazines for people who split up and are still cool enough to occupy themselves with fashion tips, reviews for eye cream and lawyers' fees.

Resignations of the year Lavinia Byrne, a 52-year-old nun, one of Britain's best-known Catholic writers and broadcasters, left her religious order in despair after she was ordered by the Vatican to stop supporting the ordination of women priests. Ian Thomas, 29, quit his job as deputy governor at the Feltham Young Offenders' Institution in west London, one of the largest in Britain: 'The conditions they are kept in are more suitable to a Dickens novel than the 21st century,' he said. Kevin Keegan, the England football coach, stood down, admitting that the job was bigger than he was. Jennie Page, chief executive of the Millennium Dome, bowed out, to be replaced by Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, former vice-president of Disneyland Paris; three months later, Bob Ayling, the former British Airways chief executive, was forced to resign as chairman of the Dome company, following his sacking from BA.

The summer holiday booking season is about to reach its peak, and from Exmoor to North Korea, West Africa to South America, here is a sprinkling of the many new options on offer for 2001. </p> <p><strong> Brazil</strong><br> </p> <p> Earlier attempts to launch charters to Rio bit the dust, partly because customers were deterred by fears of street crime. But tour operators reckon they have cracked the Brazil nut with beach packages on the north coast combined with city tours and visits to sights such as the Amazon rain forest. </p> <p>Unijet (08705 336336), for example, is offering holidays between May and October to three main resort areas - <strong> Natal</strong> in Rio Grande do Norte, <strong> Recife </strong> in Penambuco and <strong> Salvador</strong> in Bahia - with prices from \u00a3799 for two weeks and seat-only deals from \u00a3399. </p> <p>SuperClubs has opened a new all-inclusive resort called <strong> Brisas Costa do Sauipe </strong>. An hour from Salvador Bahia airport, it has 350 rooms, a six-mile stretch of beach, an 18-hole golf course and 15 tennis courts. Funway (020-8466 0222) is offering holidays there and Airtours has also included the resort in a new dedicated brochure. </p> <p><strong> Emerging destinations</strong><br> </p> <p> Expect increased interest in <strong> North Korea</strong> following the thaw in relations with the south and the establishment of diplomatic links with Britain. Regent Holidays (0117 9211711) is ahead of the game, already offering five-day tours there from Beijing for \u00a3849. That covers flights to the capital Pyongyang and visits to Kaesong, the Myohyang mountains and Panmunjom for a look across the demarcation line. It also takes in the International Friendship exhibition, which includes gifts to the former leader Kim Il Sung such as a bullet-proof Zil limo from Stalin. The price does not include flights from the UK to Beijing. </p> <p>And, as relative calm descends on the Balkans, <strong> Montenegro</strong> looks likely to stage a comeback. Though its future status remains in doubt, the Foreign Office has withdrawn its advice not to go unless you have essential business. Among the tour operators tentatively venturing there is Steppes East (01285 651010), which hopes to send customers on tailor-made holidays. </p> <p> The FO has similarly softened its advice on <strong> Serbia</strong> following the demise of ex-president Milosevic, but persuading tour firms that customers are ready to return there may take a little longer. </p> <p><strong> Islands </strong><br> </p> <p> The Mediterranean, you may think, has few secrets left to offer but Sunvil (020-8568 4499) believes it has found one in the shape of <strong> Ikaria</strong>, which was once difficult to reach but is now linked by hydrofoil with the much better known Samos. It attracts few outsiders, says the firm, but its forests, mountains and lakes make it an excellent choice for walkers, and its bucolic panyiris - religious festivals - are something to behold. Prices start at \u00a3427 for a week's B&amp;B, \u00a3491 for two weeks, including flights from Gatwick. It costs \u00a325 extra to fly from Manchester. </p> <p>Trailfinders (020-7938 5400) has introduced <strong> Catalina Island</strong>, California, in its tailor-made North America brochure. Two days and one night cost from \u00a365pp in a double room. Twenty minutes by ferry from Long Beach, San Pedro or Dana Point. Hire a bike, go snorkelling, relax on the beach. Summer is very busy, so book well ahead. </p> <p>And Explore Worldwide (01252 760000) has introduced the <strong> Cape Verde Islands</strong>, 275 miles off the coast of West Africa. They formed a colony of Portugal until 1975 and the Portuguese influence remains strong there, in architecture, food and wine. Explore points to deserted beaches, volcanic mountains and spectacular scenery. It is offering a 14-day trip, taking in five islands, for \u00a31,055 - including flights from Heathrow and accommodation in hotels and a couple of village houses, mostly on a B&amp;B basis. </p> <p><strong> Britain</strong><br> </p> <p> Expect crowds to descend on <strong> north Devon</strong> following the BBC's adaptation of RD Blackmore's novel Lorna Doone. Costumes from the Christmas TV production will be on show from April to October at Lynton town hall. And a Doone Valley trail has been mapped out, so visitors can follow in Lorna's footsteps past Badgworthy Water, through Hoccombe Combe and Yealscombe Wood to St Mary's Church at Oare, where she was shot. For a leaflet on the trail, call Lynton tourist information centre (01598 752225) or drop in at similar centres around Exmoor. </p> <p>Stand by for big changes at <strong> Jorvik</strong>, the recreated Viking city in York. The centre is being expanded at a cost of \u00a35m to represent the settlement as it looked in 975AD. Visitors will now arrive by river and \"fly over the city in a time capsule\". (<a href=\"http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk\">www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk</a>). </p> <p>Cod may soon be in short supply but Kingston Upon Hull, also in Yorkshire, plans a fishy antidote to quotas. Later this year <strong> The Deep</strong> will open there, incorporating what is claimed to be Europe's deepest aquarium tunnel, a viewing lift that will travel through tanks containing sharks and coral and an interactive representation of an ocean floor research station (<a href=\"http://www.thedeep.co.uk\">www.thedeep.co.uk</a>). </p> <p><strong> Safaris</strong><br> </p> <p> June 21 sees a total eclipse of the sun over <strong> southern Africa</strong>. Holidays have been selling like hot cakes, but among those with a handful left is Okavango Tours and Safaris (020-8343 3283), which is offering a 10-day trip to Madagascar for \u00a32,124, with flights from Heathrow via Paris. Customers will watch the eclipse while camping in Isalo National Park. </p> <p>It's not only the Aussies who have flying doctors. Cedarberg Southern African Travel (020-8941 1717) is offering a one-week safari in <strong> Maputaland</strong>, in northern KwaZulu Natal, which, as well as rhino tracking and elephant watching, includes the option of flying to rural clinics and a local hospital. It costs from \u00a31,385, which includes flights from Heathrow and full-board at the Pongola Game Reserve. A portion of the holiday cost goes to support local health care. </p> <p>At least two operators have launched safaris specifically aimed at <strong> families</strong>. Dragoman (01728 861133) has put together two, 14-night East African tours departing Nairobi on July 28 and December 22. It says groups will consist only of families. As well as game drives and a visit to Elsamere, former home of the Born Free Adamsons, it includes camping by Lake Nakuru and finishes with three days in Zanzibar. The trips cost \u00a3605 for adults and \u00a3490 for 8-15 year olds - plus a kitty of \u00a3305 to cover food and camping fees. </p> <p>Guerba World Travel (01373 826611) is offering a two-week tour for parents with children aged eight or over, for example, taking in <strong> Namibia's </strong>Namib-Naukluft, Waterberg and Etosha National Parks and including two days at Victoria Falls. Prices start at \u00a3830 for adults (17 and over) plus a \u00a3125 kitty contribution for food and camping fees - or \u00a3415 for 8-11 year olds and \u00a3695 for 12-16 year olds, each with a \u00a3110 kitty. These prices do not cover airfares from Britain, which will cost around \u00a3730 return for adults or roughly \u00a3450 for under 12s. </p> <p><strong> Trekking</strong><br> </p> <p> Mountaineer Eric Shipton's son John will lead an intriguing new trek in <strong> China </strong> from Himalayan Kingdoms (01453 844 400). The 21-day Plant Hunters of Yunnan trip, from June 9-29 takes travellers in search of flora in remote areas near the Tibetan border. It takes in Napha Lake and the Baima Mountain and Reserve. The cost is \u00a33,425 and flights are via Hong Kong or Bangkok. </p> <p><strong> Planes, trains &amp; cruise ships</strong><br> </p> <p> British Midland (0870 6070555) plans to launch scheduled services between Manchester and the US next spring, promising big savings against other carriers' economy business-class prices.

Parents take their own bikes and fix the trailers on the back. Prices start at \u00a3432 a head for a 12-night holiday in Normandy.

      "bodyText": "A packed British Airways jumbo came within seconds of disaster yesterday when a mentally unstable passenger stormed the cockpit and attempted to seize the controls. The Nairobi-bound Boeing 747, with 379 passengers on board, plunged 10,000ft as the captain and one of his first officers wrestled with the intruder on the flight deck for two minutes. BA flight 2069 had left Gatwick six hours earlier and was cruising 35,000ft above Sudan when one of the struggling men accidentally disengaged the autopilot. Passengers screamed in terror and prayed for their lives as the plane dived steeply down then, witnesses said, banked left at a sharp angle heading for the ground. Oxygen masks dropped from their hatches as bags flew through the cabins and passengers who were not strapped in bumped their heads on the backs of seats. A flight attendant was thrown to the ground, breaking her ankle, as Captain William Hagan struggled with the intruder, poking his fingers into the man's eyes. In the scuffle the intruder bit one of the pilot's fingers and his ear but, aided by one of his first officers, Capt Hagan succeeded in dragging him out of the cockpit and into the club class cabin. There passengers rushed to help, including a 6ft 6in tall American who helped bundle the man to the ground. Phil Watson, 38, the co-pilot, who had been sitting at the controls throughout, pulled the plane out of its dive and ended the two-minute crisis, which took place just before 5am. Among those on board were Lady Annabel Goldsmith, widow of the businessman Sir James, her daughter Jemima Khan and her son Benjamin. Mrs Khan was travelling to Kenya with her children, Kasim, aged 18 months, and Sulaiman, four, for a two-week holiday. Also on board were the singer Bryan Ferry and his wife Lucy Helmore, en route to Zanzibar for a family break. \"I'm relieved to get here in one piece,\" he said on his eventual safe arrival in Nairobi. Capt Hagan, 53, whose wife and two children were on board, said: \"It all happened very quickly. My first thought was for the safety of the aircraft and the passengers.

The chairmanship of the rail operator falls vacant when Sir Philip Beck retires next year. Mr James, whose crisis management credits range from Dan Air to Eagle Trust, indicated yesterday that he was attracted to Railtrack. \"It's big, it's national and it is a crisis,\" he said in an interview with the Guardian. Mr James, now overseeing the winding down of the dome, said his interest was conditional on a clear job definition and on the backing of the Railtrack board. \"I would need to know what needs to be done, but it is a sovereign board and I would not be shifted into any board against its wishes. And I would need to know where the finishing post is. \"But if I was approached, then I would consider it.\" The prospect of Mr James taking over the helm of one of Britain's most controversial companies would be a welcome lift to the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. As head of a department that includes transport, Mr Prescott has sought to keep a hold on the growing crisis in the railways, where accidents have led to hold-ups, mass cancellations and plummeting public confidence. He would appreciate Mr James' strong financial background (he describes himself as a \"beancounter\") that would enable him to get to grips with the complexities of financing of the rail network. Mr James' experience of stepping into controversies gives him a solid platform from which to conduct the public relations campaign that Railtrack will need to restore its image. However there is some concern that he has no direct operational experience of running a railway, a criticism also levelled at Railtrack's chief executive Steven Marshall, who stepped up from finance director when Gerald Corbett resigned as chief. One industry source said, \"The company is clearly lacking in high level input from professional railway people. \"It has become too far removed from what it should be, which is basically an engineering business.\" The crisis was underlined again yesterday when Mr Prescott indicated that a recovery of the network would probably take until Easter. On Radio 4's Today programme he accused rail firms of showing \"indifference\" to passengers by increasing fares while the network faced chaos. It showed a lack of judgment, he said, and he agreed that the private operators would have to \"watch out\" in the future. \"I'm sure the public are fed up with this poor quality production. \"The companies will say they are losing income but it's not fair to put the burden on the passenger,\" he said. Some train operators had not passed on the costs to passengers, and they should be an example to the rest, he said. Mr Prescott also hit out at those responsible for leaving hundreds stranded at Stansted airport after trains terminated before the last flights arrived on Boxing Day, saying it had been \"absolutely stupid\". It was time the culture of the railways, which failed to put the passenger first, was changed dramatically, he said. Railtrack yesterday found itself involved in a controversy over its forecasts for passenger growth. Earlier this year the company said it was working on passengers rising by 47% over the decade. Yesterday, however, it emerged that Railtrack had reduced the figure to 37% as a result of the government's decision to scrap the fuel escalator. With investment in the railways linked to growth rates, and with the new forecast taking no account of any reductions in passengers in the wake of the post-Hatfield crash problems, there had been concern about the impact on the government's transport policy - which supposes investment from 50% growth. However Railtrack yesterday insisted that its revision would have no effect on investment. \"We are all agreed we are going for growth,\" said a Railtrack spokesman; the actual differences between its forecasts and the government's were much smaller than they appeared, because the two used different forecasting models.",

Mr Cassar says a supermarket group such as Wal-Mart, which has enjoyed limited success with its online offering, could do worse than buy eToys. \"eToys clearly has to seek an acquirer,\" he said. \"Its advantage is that it has tangible assets and a strong brand.\" Even at the current low prices, few traditional businesses have stepped in to buy loss-making online counterparts. Few are sure whether their erstwhile rivals are now cheap or simply worthless.",

      "body": "<p>The gloom over the dot.com world deepened further yesterday when another high-profile internet company plunged into trouble. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.letsbuyit.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Letsbuyit</a>, best known for its advertising campaign featuring ants supposedly illustrating strength in numbers, sought and won court protection from its creditors after running into financial difficulties. </p> <p>The company, which specialises in arranging for consumers to pool their buying and bargaining power for goods, had applied to a Dutch court to delay making repayments on its debts while it sought an extra \u00a350m of funding. </p> <p>The company's website gave no indication yesterday that anything was amiss, but a spokesman said it would be closing to new orders in the near future. Existing customers would receive their goods or a full refund. </p> <p>Martin Coles, the chief executive said: \"While we still have cash and strong sales growth, we don't have any prospects of receiving funding in the short term, so we felt it was prudent to take this stand.\" </p> <p>The group, whose holding company is Dutch but whose website is based in London, is the latest in a series of online ventures to run into trouble in a sector that is seeing about one dot.com business go under every day. <a href=\"http://www.breathe.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Breathe</a> and thestreet.co.uk closed their doors last month. On top of that, <a href=\"http://www.ready2shop.com\" target=\"_NEW\">ready2shop</a> scaled back its ambitions for its website after failing to attract enough venture capital. The industry has been hit by falling share prices and the high costs of winning customers. </p> <p>The problems at Letsbuyit came to a head when it asked for trading in its shares to be halted in Frankfurt after announcing the plan to delay debt repayments. </p> <p>Stephen Cox, a spokesman for the company, said yesterday an early rescue deal was not in sight. \"We're talking to people but it takes time for these deals to conclude. There is no expectation that a deal will be done quickly.\" </p> <p>Analysts said Letsbuyit's move was a strategic plan to extend its life. The deferral of debt repayments would allow the company to use its cash for other priorities and to increase the amount of time it has to operate. \"Its not a good sign if a company can't meet its debt repayments. It suggests it has severe cash restraints,\" one said. </p> <p>Last month the company said it was looking for a partner to provide funding until it reached profitability at the end of 2002, but said it has enough cash, \u00a348m, to take it to the middle of next year. </p> <p>Mr Coles said last month: \"We definitely will be looking for cash, we're talking to people right now about the potential for investment. We'd be looking around the \u20ac80m [\u00a350m] mark.\" </p> <p>The company's cash pile has dwindled since it went public in July, when it raised half the amount it was hoping for. The flotation had been postponed twice because of negative market sentiment on technology stocks. It said it was not possible to say how much money it had left at this stage. </p> <p>Letsbuyit's shares closed at \u20ac1.25 on Thursday, 81% below its peak of \u20ac6.45 on July 21.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The gloom over the dot.com world deepened further yesterday when another high-profile internet company plunged into trouble. Letsbuyit, best known for its advertising campaign featuring ants supposedly illustrating strength in numbers, sought and won court protection from its creditors after running into financial difficulties. The company, which specialises in arranging for consumers to pool their buying and bargaining power for goods, had applied to a Dutch court to delay making repayments on its debts while it sought an extra \u00a350m of funding. The company's website gave no indication yesterday that anything was amiss, but a spokesman said it would be closing to new orders in the near future. Existing customers would receive their goods or a full refund. Martin Coles, the chief executive said: \"While we still have cash and strong sales growth, we don't have any prospects of receiving funding in the short term, so we felt it was prudent to take this stand.\" The group, whose holding company is Dutch but whose website is based in London, is the latest in a series of online ventures to run into trouble in a sector that is seeing about one dot.com business go under every day. Breathe and thestreet.co.uk closed their doors last month. On top of that, ready2shop scaled back its ambitions for its website after failing to attract enough venture capital. The industry has been hit by falling share prices and the high costs of winning customers. The problems at Letsbuyit came to a head when it asked for trading in its shares to be halted in Frankfurt after announcing the plan to delay debt repayments. Stephen Cox, a spokesman for the company, said yesterday an early rescue deal was not in sight. \"We're talking to people but it takes time for these deals to conclude. There is no expectation that a deal will be done quickly.\" Analysts said Letsbuyit's move was a strategic plan to extend its life. The deferral of debt repayments would allow the company to use its cash for other priorities and to increase the amount of time it has to operate. \"Its not a good sign if a company can't meet its debt repayments. It suggests it has severe cash restraints,\" one said. Last month the company said it was looking for a partner to provide funding until it reached profitability at the end of 2002, but said it has enough cash, \u00a348m, to take it to the middle of next year. Mr Coles said last month: \"We definitely will be looking for cash, we're talking to people right now about the potential for investment. We'd be looking around the \u20ac80m [\u00a350m] mark.\" The company's cash pile has dwindled since it went public in July, when it raised half the amount it was hoping for. The flotation had been postponed twice because of negative market sentiment on technology stocks. It said it was not possible to say how much money it had left at this stage. Letsbuyit's shares closed at \u20ac1.25 on Thursday, 81% below its peak of \u20ac6.45 on July 21.",

      "bodyText": "Police said yesterday they had arrested 10 people from the prestigious Burgundy wine-producing capital of Beaune in what experts fear may turn into one of France's biggest and most costly wine scandals of recent years. Tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of bottles of some of the country's top wines could be affected by the scam, which police said involved grands crus being \"cut\" with low-grade plonk and inferior wines being labelled as high-quality. A Dijon fraud squad spokesman said most of the major wines of Burgundy's sought-after C\u00f4te d'Or region were concerned, including Beaune premier cru, Pommard premier cru, Volnay, Gevrey-Chambertin, Meursault premier cru and Nuits-Saint-Georges. \"It is a very serious matter indeed,\" the spokesman said. \"Some very classy wines that can change hands even when young for over \u00a3100 a bottle have been cut with up to 30% of rubbish from the Midi or Languedoc, and generic Burgundy table wine has been sold as premier cru.\" The men arrested, who include several leading Burgundy wholesalers and wine merchants as well as the managing director of the region's main bottling company, have been placed under formal examination for fraud and forgery. Police say they suspect more may be involved and other arrests may follow. One Beaune-based company, Goichot, is suspected of adding quantities of vin ordinaire to stocks of undrinkable waste wine that were meant to be turned into vinegar, and passing the result off as a middle of the range Burgundy. The scale of the swindle has staggered experts and local officials and could prove highly damaging to the region's growers, who last year produced 161m bottles of Burgundy worth some \u00a3600m. \"I'm afraid these are very far from being glad tidings of seasonal good cheer,\" said Hubert Camus, the vice-president of the Burgundy wine board. \"Our fathers and grandfathers have laboured since the 1930s to bring Burgundy wines the renown they enjoy today. This destroys their efforts.\" The affair may only concern four Beaune merchants who are \"more unscrupulous businessmen out to make money than genuine wine lovers\", Mr Camus said, \"but they are sizable players and Burgundy in its entirety risks being affected by their actions\". Traditionally, two-thirds of Burgundy's production is exported to countries such as Britain. Producers, already worried by several years of what they see as unhealthy inflation in Burgundy prices compared with those fetched by rival Bordeaux wines, fear the scam may trigger a collapse in foreign sales. Louis-Marc Chevignard, a leading French wine taster, said: \"At first we thought this was an isolated case, but it appears to go much further. International wine reputations are very fragile things. When certain professionals are without conscience, it is all Burgundy that suffers.\" Fraud is by no means new in the French wine business. Two years ago it emerged that 177,000 bottles of 1995 Ch\u00e2teau Giscours, a Margaux noted for years as one of Bordeaux's top M\u00e9doc wines, had been doctored with sugar, water, acids and even milk as part of an attempt to ruin its new owner, a Dutchman. But as Bordeaux wines are sold by the ch\u00e2teaux that make them, the subsequent slump in sales affected only Ch\u00e2teau Giscours. Burgundy wines are traditionally produced by individual growers but sold by wine merchants based mainly in Beaune - meaning the slightest whiff of wine tampering can harm the whole region.",

A member of Oxford's lightweight rowing club was swept away after two boats capsized near the south-eastern city of Tarragona on the river Ebro, which is currently swollen by heavy rain and melted snow. He was named last night as Leo Blockley, 21, a maths postgraduate, one of two crews of oarsmen and women who were racing across the river at Amposta, Oxford's winter training base. Seventeen other people were rescued and nine people - seven men and two women - were treated for hypothermia after they had been thrown from the two coxed eights when waves were whipped up by gusts of wind. The lightweight team - distinct from the main university eight which rows the annual Boat Race against Cambridge - had gone ahead with its scheduled training when the Ebro appeared calm, in spite of a series of official warnings of 100kph (60mph) winds. Catalonia's regional emergency services said last night that the possibility of dangerous gusts had not been left in any doubt by a series of warnings after Christmas. The lightweight club team, which was training for a series of races against Cambridge crews in March, was involved in controversy in Amposta last year, when 24 oarsmen were arrested for allegedly damaging a pizza restaurant during post-training celebrations. They were held briefly in the local jail but a judge ordered the dropping of all charges. Yesterday's training, for which the rowers do not wear lifejackets, required the three delicate \"shell\" boats to cross 300 metres of the Ebro after two earlier sessions had gone smoothly. Axel Muller, a coach of Spain's national rowing team who is working with the club, said: \"We had had two normal training sessions and when we went out, there was just a light breeze.\" Violent gusts then struck the area when the crews were in mid-river, causing chaos and conflicting accounts of precisely what happened next.

      "bodyText": "President Bill Clinton will spend the weekend telephoning Arab leaders in an attempt to salvage the Middle East peace process before a decisive meeting planned for Cairo next week. Arab foreign ministers are to meet in the Egyptian capital at the request of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to discuss the US president's plans for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A Lebanese government source said the Arab League summit, originally scheduled for Monday, would be put back to Thursday to allow more time for consideration. Washington hopes that wider Arab support for the proposals will persuade Mr Arafat to give a positive response. But events on the ground yesterday conspired against a settlement. An Israeli shell killed a Palestinian policeman on the Israel-Gaza border in the biggest gun battle for more than a week. The exchange began after the Israelis bulldozed trees near a Palestinian military position, claiming that the foliage could provide cover for gunmen. An Israeli defence spokesman said a tank shell was fired after the Israeli troops came under heavy gunfire. An Israeli commander earlier spoke despairingly of the \"Lebanisation\" of the border with Gaza. At the end of a week in which progress on the peace front suddenly seemed possible, only to be snatched away, 15 Palestinians were wounded in incidents on the West Bank. Tension has been heightened in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by Israel's decision to seal off both borders after two bomb blasts by Palestinian militants on Thursday. About 10,000 supporters of the militant Palestinian group Hamas, which is thought to be responsible for one of the bomb attacks, held a rally in the West Bank city of Nablus yesterday and cheered as organisers burned a replica of the Israeli bus bombed in Tel Aviv on Thursday. The Hizbullah guerrilla leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, urged them in an address by telephone from Lebanon to continue their uprising until Israel was destroyed. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, was presented yesterday with evidence of increasing Israeli disillusionment with his handling of the peace process. Opinion polls in two Israeli papers, Yedioth Ahronoth and Ma'ariv, showed majorities opposed to the US proposals. In the poll in Yedioth Ahronoth, 51% opposed reaching an accord and only 44% were in favour. The polls are the first test of opinion since the shape of the proposed peace agreement became public. Mr Barak also received his lowest popularity rating since he came to power last year. One of the polls suggested that support for him had dropped to 30%, and put the opposition candidate for prime minister, Ariel Sharon, on 53%. The polls suggest that even if Mr Barak does secure a peace deal with the Palestinians, he will still lose the prime ministerial election on February 6 to Mr Sharon, the Likud leader. Mr Sharon, the hardliner responsible for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and for the recent flare-up of Palestinian violence, has said he will not abide by any settlement negotiated by Mr Barak. The Palestinians continued to refuse to either back or reject Mr Clinton's plans yesterday. Israelis, from the cabinet down to the streets, are divided on whether Mr Arafat is playing a tactical delaying game to squeeze more concessions in the dying days of Mr Clinton's presidency or the peace process is effectively over for the time being. Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian foreign minister, said yesterday that Mr Arafat was still prepared to meet Mr Barak, but that wide differences remained on the key issues: the fate of Palestinian refugees, the division of Jerusalem, including the disputed holy sites, and the territorial boundaries of a future Palestinian state. He said Mr Clinton's proposals needed \"to be clarified and developed in order to really go forward with them as the basis for future negotiations and we are in the process of trying very positively to do that\". The Palestinians asked the US to provide a detailed map showing the proposed territorial changes. Mr Arafat identified the refugees as one of the main stumbling blocks during a telephone conversation with a member of the Israeli parliament, Sallah Tarif, who had phoned him at Mr Barak's request. Mr Arafat complained to him that Mr Barak was stubborn. \"Even when Ben Gurion established the state of Israel, he allowed more Palestinian refugees to return than Barak is now,\" he said. In a package that would form the basis for peace talks, the Israeli government has tentatively agreed to force at least 20% of the Jewish settlers on the West Bank and Gaza to leave. But yesterday the government extended until 2001 the rights of such settlers to a formidable array of incentives, including housing grants, a 7% income tax break, subsidised mortgages and free schooling. Professor Galia Golan, speaking on behalf of the campaign group Peace Now, said this could lead to more bloodshed and make a peace agreement even more difficult. \"Because we believe Barak is intent on achieving peace, we find it difficult to understand how a decision like this could have been made at this critical juncture,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "Bristolians are to have a direct say in setting their council tax under a radical scheme being drawn up by the city council. Faced with the choice of raising the council tax by 5% or cutting next year's education budget, councillors plan to ask the city's 300,000 voters to express their view in a referendum. The vote, expected to be endorsed at a meeting of the Labour-run council on January 16, would be the first in a UK city and will be watched closely by government ministers and by local authorities elsewhere. There is widespread concern across local government about apathy on the part of the voters who use council services, and such referendums are expected to spread as a way of getting people involved in making decisions. Bristol can draw on its experience of conducting a smaller referendum on a separate local issue as it finalises the \u00a3120,000 council tax ballot. In what has proved to be a useful dry run for the city vote, 30,000 residents of the Hengrove area of the city were asked if they would be happy to see a football and sports stadium built in their neighbourhood. On a turnout of just over 10,000 they rejected the proposal by almost two to one. To encourage as big a response as possible in next month's referendum, voters will be able to register their preference either by post, by phone or via the internet. Council taxes in Bristol have been frozen for two years. The authority is keen to continue holding them down, but the government's financial settlement for next year means they would have to rise by 4% to 5% if spending on services were to be protected. Bristol's spending on education is said to be among the highest in the country. Council members say that, if the council tax were to stay frozen, next year's budget would have to be cut by \u00a34.5m, and they warn that the cut to balance the budget would in effect have to come from education, as that is the only area in which Bristol is spending above the government's guidelines. Council leader George Micklewright said that holding a referendum would be an important step for local democracy in Britain: \"We have been looking for ways to give Bristol people more say over important council decisions.\" If it goes ahead, voters are expected to chose between four options: \u0095 no increase in tax and a \u00a34.5m cut in education - equivalent to the loss of 180 teachers; \u0095 a 2% council tax rise, with \u00a32.2m cut from the schools budget; \u0095 a 4% increase with a standstill in council spending; \u0095 a 6% increase, allowing an extra \u00a32.2m to be spent on education. The council hopes to get at least a 50% response compared with the 33% turnout in the last council elections in Bristol. It plans to issue ballot papers within days of a go-ahead. Voters will also be provided with supporting documents explaining the implications of the options before them. The referendum is likely to use a transferable vote (a first choice, and second choice if that is knocked out, etc), and will be conducted by the Electoral Reform Society. The result is expected in February.

      "bodyText": "A Republican party star and welfare-reform pioneer who favours a Harley-Davidson motorcycle as his mode of transport was selected yesterday by president-elect George W Bush as secretary of health and human services. Tommy Thompson, America's longest-serving governor, is credited with huge cuts in the number of Wisconsin families on welfare since he took office 14 years ago. His methods included cutting public assistance to parents whose children fail to attend school; making fathers take part in work schemes if they do not pay child support; and finding more cash for teenage parents if they marry. But critics say that a buoyant economy has had more to do with his success in cutting families on welfare from 98,000 to just over 16,000. Mr Thompson will head one of the government's biggest departments, with health insurance programmes and financial assistance for low-income families among the areas under its remit. The 59-year-old governor is joined in the president-elect's inner circle by Gale Norton, the controversial former Colorado attorney general. Ms Norton, 46, named as interior secretary with responsibility for the environment, has already made herself unpopular with the green lobby because of her support for oil exploration in the Arctic national wildlife refuge. Yesterday's nominations - the education and veterans' affairs jobs were also filled - leave only three cabinet slots vacant, still with no sign of the Democrat Mr Bush said he wanted to appoint as a balancing factor after the election. George Tenet, the CIA director appointed by Bill Clinton's administration, is expected to keep his job. Rod Paige, the superintendent of schools in Houston, Texas, and an advocate of vouchers to move pupils from public to private schools, was named education secretary. He becomes the second black cabinet member, following Colin Powell, who has been designated secretary of state. Anthony Principi, a former deputy secretary of the department of veterans' affairs, now gets the department's top job. Mr Thompson is a conservative populist who has moved closer to the centre and likes to identify himself with every perceived success during his four terms as Wisconsin governor: he takes credit for everything from falling welfare rolls and job creation to sporting victories and better toilets in parks. \"He can't stand not to be somewhere where things are happening,\" said Mark Bugher, a long-time aide. \"He has to be everywhere because he's afraid to be nowhere, in some ways. He's afraid to be forgotten.\" The issue that made him a national figure was W-2, or Wisconsin Works, a scheme based on the premise that everyone must do some sort of job as a condition of receiving childcare, transportation or healthcare benefits. Opponents say that the scheme is unfair to minorities and the poor, and that it ended up costing more than the welfare system it replaced. \u0095 Hillary Clinton is thought to have settled on a new home in Washington, a six-bedroomed mansion with a $3.5m (\u00a32.3m) price tag near the British embassy. Mrs Clinton needs a home in the capital to do her new job as a senator, in the same way that she needed one in New York to qualify to run for a seat representing the state. Her last plunge into the property market, just over a year ago, produced a $1.7m house about 45 minutes north of Manhattan.

Two crows have been enjoying rich pickings these last couple of months swooping down and stealing balls off the 17th green. It seems the birds mistake the balls for eggs, but instead of a snack of ante-natal plover or pigeon, they get several kilometres of coiled string inside a Wilson or Callaway. </p> <p>The aggrieved members, watching their balls fly away, are demanding that their club remove the birds by whatever means is necessary. Including shooting. These spluttering plus-fours would have displayed enough unnatural cruelty to carry off the award, were it not for their lack of awareness of the rules of the game. They should know every possible hazard is covered in the Royal &amp; Ancient's bible-like rule book and they should not be demanding action beyond established precedent. For instance, animal intervention is already a fact of life on one course in Florida, where a player is entitled to a drop shot if a salamander should remove his ball from the fairway. Although there is not the same leniency, curiously, if it is a pelican which is doing the scavenging. </p> <p><strong> The Railtrack award for outstanding achievement in public relations</strong> </p> <p>Manchester United led from the front for this one, elbowing aside the striking England rugby players and everyone involved in snooker. Their year began with an appalling press release warning fans not to travel to Rio de Janeiro for the ill-conceived World Club Championship last January. </p> <p>A festering hell-hole populated entirely by muggers and HIV-positive transvestite prostitutes was the gist of the warning. Imagine how well that one went down with their hosts. As a piece of ill-informed nonsense, it was like officials of teams visiting Manchester alerting their fans to the fact that the city is alive with gun-toting, crack-headed drug runners. No, hang on, that sounds accurate enough to me. </p> <p>Anyway, in order to ensure there would be no more repeats of the blunder, the club hired a public relations director. The only problem was Alison Ryan, the director in question, turned out to have an approach to the truth to match that of Jeffrey Archer. It transpired she had made up her qualifications so she was sacked, leaving faces all round Old Trafford smeared with egg. </p> <p>But despite their best efforts, United were pipped at the last by their neighbours City. In the programme for the final Maine Road match of 2000, a reference was made to United's nickname in blue parts: the Munichs. \"Human error,\" was the official City line to explain how the term made its way into officially sanctioned print. Which as a euphemism for ugly, offensive reference to the victims of tragedy is about as award-winningly shabby as they come. </p> <p><strong> The Goran Ivanisevic Award for services to tennis racket manufacturers</strong> </p> <p> Goran wins the award yet again, after his heroic display at an ATP tournament in Bournemouth last month. Angered by the deficiencies of his own performance, he smashed not one but three rackets, a tantrum which culminated in the discovery that he had none left intact in his kit bag with which to proceed. He was thus forced to concede defeat, and was obliged to hobble off court with at least a dozen metaphorical gunshot wounds peppering his own feet. The rules for this category state that after three wins, the winner is entitled to keep the award in perpetuity. So Ivanisevic can take it home with him. And will no doubt smash it into several small pieces on his kitchen floor. </p> <p><strong> Most self-destructive team of the year</strong> </p> <p> The Football Association was in pole position for this one, as indeed would be any organisation which made Kevin Keegan head coach. The award looked to be in the bag after things sunk to depths of comedy unplumbed even by England football teams: Keegan retreating after woeful defeat by Germany, chucking control of his team towards the butter-fingered hands of Howard Wilkinson. But then the blousons of Soho Square (as the modernised new FA must now be termed) made an enlightened appointment. Sven-Goran Eriksson may not, as his critics have suggested, be the best in Italy, he may not even be the best in Sweden, but he is several heads and half a dozen pairs of shoulders above anyone else willing to do the job. </p> <p>With the field clear, Bradford City made their stab at the award for self-destruction when Benito Carbone and Stan Collymore were united in the same dressing room. But at least Bradford have won the occasional game, unlike the clear winners of this category. Normally in such circumstances, we would say: \"Step forward Oxford United.\" Except with Oxford, the side with the worst record in English football, one step forward is generally followed by two steps back. </p> <p>Not for United a succession of thrashings this season. No, they have sunk to the basement of the Second Division after a magnificently self-destructive run, losing nine of their last 15 games by a single goal. Five times they have lost by three goals to two. Five times they have managed to go down after taking the lead. </p> <p>\"I have never come across a team who can find so many new and unusual ways of throwing away a game,\" said one canny observer this week. Unfortunately he is Dave Kemp, the team's manager. Which, as a prognosis for the rest of the season, won't fill many supporters' hearts with confidence. </p> <p><strong> The Ken Bates award</strong> </p> <p> As always, there is only one winner in the category reserved for the man whose actions seem designed to inflict maximum damage on his own interests. Who else but our winner would sack the most successful manager in his club's history five weeks into the season? Who else would seek to impose a business model on the national stadium which is looking distinctly unprofitable when applied to the reconstruction of his own club's ground? </p> <p>Yes, Ken Bates has been at it again, though it would be remiss to suggest that the restaurants at the new Stamford Bridge do not offer a unique service. After all, nowhere else in the locale, when booking for dinner, are patrons offered a choice of 50 tables. But there is more to Ken Bates than simply sacking good managers and attempting to blag through grandiose building schemes at the public expense. </p> <p>This was the year in which his past business dealings in Lancashire and the Caribbean were ruthlessly exposed by the brilliant Radio 5 investigative series, On The Line. After that, and after Wembley, and after the black hole that is Chelsea's finances, there may not be much more room for manoeuvre. </p> <p>Make the most of it Ken: this might be the last occasion when you receive our Sports Poisonality of the Year award.</p>",

Their year began with an appalling press release warning fans not to travel to Rio de Janeiro for the ill-conceived World Club Championship last January. A festering hell-hole populated entirely by muggers and HIV-positive transvestite prostitutes was the gist of the warning. Imagine how well that one went down with their hosts. As a piece of ill-informed nonsense, it was like officials of teams visiting Manchester alerting their fans to the fact that the city is alive with gun-toting, crack-headed drug runners. No, hang on, that sounds accurate enough to me. Anyway, in order to ensure there would be no more repeats of the blunder, the club hired a public relations director. The only problem was Alison Ryan, the director in question, turned out to have an approach to the truth to match that of Jeffrey Archer. It transpired she had made up her qualifications so she was sacked, leaving faces all round Old Trafford smeared with egg. But despite their best efforts, United were pipped at the last by their neighbours City. In the programme for the final Maine Road match of 2000, a reference was made to United's nickname in blue parts: the Munichs. \"Human error,\" was the official City line to explain how the term made its way into officially sanctioned print. Which as a euphemism for ugly, offensive reference to the victims of tragedy is about as award-winningly shabby as they come. The Goran Ivanisevic Award for services to tennis racket manufacturers Goran wins the award yet again, after his heroic display at an ATP tournament in Bournemouth last month. Angered by the deficiencies of his own performance, he smashed not one but three rackets, a tantrum which culminated in the discovery that he had none left intact in his kit bag with which to proceed. He was thus forced to concede defeat, and was obliged to hobble off court with at least a dozen metaphorical gunshot wounds peppering his own feet. The rules for this category state that after three wins, the winner is entitled to keep the award in perpetuity. So Ivanisevic can take it home with him. And will no doubt smash it into several small pieces on his kitchen floor. Most self-destructive team of the year The Football Association was in pole position for this one, as indeed would be any organisation which made Kevin Keegan head coach. The award looked to be in the bag after things sunk to depths of comedy unplumbed even by England football teams: Keegan retreating after woeful defeat by Germany, chucking control of his team towards the butter-fingered hands of Howard Wilkinson. But then the blousons of Soho Square (as the modernised new FA must now be termed) made an enlightened appointment. Sven-Goran Eriksson may not, as his critics have suggested, be the best in Italy, he may not even be the best in Sweden, but he is several heads and half a dozen pairs of shoulders above anyone else willing to do the job. With the field clear, Bradford City made their stab at the award for self-destruction when Benito Carbone and Stan Collymore were united in the same dressing room. But at least Bradford have won the occasional game, unlike the clear winners of this category. Normally in such circumstances, we would say: \"Step forward Oxford United.\" Except with Oxford, the side with the worst record in English football, one step forward is generally followed by two steps back. Not for United a succession of thrashings this season. No, they have sunk to the basement of the Second Division after a magnificently self-destructive run, losing nine of their last 15 games by a single goal. Five times they have lost by three goals to two. Five times they have managed to go down after taking the lead. \"I have never come across a team who can find so many new and unusual ways of throwing away a game,\" said one canny observer this week. Unfortunately he is Dave Kemp, the team's manager. Which, as a prognosis for the rest of the season, won't fill many supporters' hearts with confidence. The Ken Bates award As always, there is only one winner in the category reserved for the man whose actions seem designed to inflict maximum damage on his own interests. Who else but our winner would sack the most successful manager in his club's history five weeks into the season? Who else would seek to impose a business model on the national stadium which is looking distinctly unprofitable when applied to the reconstruction of his own club's ground? Yes, Ken Bates has been at it again, though it would be remiss to suggest that the restaurants at the new Stamford Bridge do not offer a unique service. After all, nowhere else in the locale, when booking for dinner, are patrons offered a choice of 50 tables. But there is more to Ken Bates than simply sacking good managers and attempting to blag through grandiose building schemes at the public expense. This was the year in which his past business dealings in Lancashire and the Caribbean were ruthlessly exposed by the brilliant Radio 5 investigative series, On The Line. After that, and after Wembley, and after the black hole that is Chelsea's finances, there may not be much more room for manoeuvre. Make the most of it Ken: this might be the last occasion when you receive our Sports Poisonality of the Year award.",

      "bodyText": "Top of last year's Christmas wish list for many City stalwarts was a handheld computer to replace the ageing Filofax bought back in 1985. Among those to benefit from this silent revolution was Psion, for many years a pioneer in a field which has only recently become so fiercely competitive. Although the company brought out its first electronic organiser in 1984, four years after it was founded, it took a while to persuade devotees of the pen and pencil to give new technology a chance. But for a company whose shares peaked this year at \u00a315 the past few months have been trying times. Not only has it been facing intense rivalry from the likes of Palm, Handspring and Compaq, but its own performance has fallen well short of scintillating, which resulted in a profits warning back in October. Shares have been sinking fast ever since, with more than \u00a34bn being taken off the company's value since the spring. And life looks set to get even more difficult with reports that Psion has found problems with its new Revo model which cause the screen to blank out soon after it has been recharged, preventing users from accessing phone numbers. Psion is refusing to comment on the numbers of machines being returned, but the problem is not thought to be affecting all the units, up to 30,000, that are sold each month. Despite initially dropping 10% as news of the problem leaked out, combined with a bout of profit taking, shares were not too badly hit yesterday and bounced back as the London markets closed at lunchtime. Psion's stock ended the session up 3.4%, or 9.5p, to 286.5p, some way ahead of the 209.5p year low but still way off the \u00a315 high. This year won't go down as a classic in Psion's 20-year history but it is hard to see how much lower the share price can fall. Hold.",

      "bodyText": "A depressing year in the City finally came to a close yesterday lunchtime with the bluechip FTSE 100 recording only the third annual decline in its 17-year history. Over the course of a turbulent 12 months, in which the market fell spectacularly out of love with telecoms and technology, the benchmark index dropped 10% to 6222.5 points. Its fall also brought to an end five years of double-digit gains that had culminated in the record high of 6930.2 at the end of last year. The index, regarded as the barometer of corporate Britain, had only previously suffered annual falls in 1990 and 1994 when it sank 12% and 10% respectively. But yesterday's performance clearly illustrated the mood in the Square Mile with many having become depressed with the seemingly endless stream of earnings worries and profits warnings being issued. The half-day session, the last one of the year, saw the index dropping slightly down by 0.7 points - 707.7 points adrift of its position as the millennium celebrations were in full swing. Dealers said last night that expectations of interest rate cuts in 2001 were likely to be the principle factors in deciding how strongly the market was likely to perform over the next few months. But they warned trading may be further hit if the expected cut fails to materialise until the second half of the year. The year 2000 will always be remembered for the derating which swept through the telecoms and technology sectors that had been responsible for dragging the FTSE to its 1999 highs. Telewest Communications, British Telecom and Colt Telecom all had a nightmare year in which they lost more than 50% of their value. Thus, a telecoms company which was a member of the index in the early months before being relegated, failed to escape the downward spiral and had lost around 85% of its value by yesterday. Baltimore Technologies and Bookham, formerly the blue-eyed boys of the 100, lost their positions in the year's final shake-up of the index. But it was not all bad news and, excluding telecoms and technology, the market actually rose year on year. While investors ran shy of IT firms as the internet bubble began to burst early in 2000, the biotech sector became the chief beneficiary of their affections. The Celltech Group, which only gained promotion to the index at the end of March, watched its share price surge ahead to end the year up 121% with analysts impressed by the growth prospects of its cancer, arthritis and asthma treatments. Shire Pharmaceutical was another celebrating with a 70% rise over the period. Defensive stocks generally found themselves in favour as investors searched for ways of minimising the risks of the economic cycle. British American Tobacco, along with others in its sector, started the year under a cloud with concerns over an inquiry into their past conduct by MPs on the House of Commons health select committee. But despite the resulting launch of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation into its alleged links with smuggling, BAT enjoyed a 45% rise amid hopes of a more lenient legal environment in the US under George W Bush. Analysts are expecting the FTSE 100 to rebound by the end of 2001, with some predicting it could bounce up to the 7,000 point mark, especially if there are lower interest rates in Britain and the US, which would sharpen the appetite of investors.",

It is, however, a fine romance, which has a sound moral purpose, a love and understanding of the common people and a descriptive power which captures the beauty of the rural English scene of its period. Where was any of that in this thin version? We were given innumerable pre-transmission tales of period longhorn cattle and of an endless sea of mud and grime. I think most viewers would sacrifice an entire herd of longhorn cattle for a handful of characters bearing even a passing resemblance to those so lovingly drawn by the author. Whatever happened to the gentle giant John Ridd, as high and as wide as a barn? Every time anyone hit him, he fell over! Production values didn't run to telling a coherent tale either. Without the vital opening scenes, most of what followed was nonsense Surely the guiding principle when adapting a book for the small screen must be a genuine attempt to portray the characters of the original with truth and integrity, to use as much of the author's dialogue as possible (rather than none of it whatsoever), to tell the tale he wrote and not something vaguely similar, and to try and capture, with imagination and fidelity, the spirit of the book. This principle was simply, in Mark Twain's memorable phrase, flung down and danced upon. Trevor Walter Nottingham",

Few medicines were effective in 1948 and only a dozen or so from that era - among them aspirin, insulin, morphine and penicillin - are still used today.</p> <p>But there have been more medical breakthroughs in the past 50 years than in the previous 2,500. Medicines have multiplied. About 90% in use in the early 1990s were unknown 30 years before; 50% were unknown six years previously. Yet the regulation of this market continues to create unease, as yesterday's report from our health editor on the new director of drugs licensing at the medicines control agency (MCA) confirms.</p> <p>The new director, Dr Ian Hudson, is a former top executive at SmithKline Beecham, which with its merger this week with Glaxo Wellcome, is now the world's biggest pharmaceutical company. The MCA rejected suggestions that Dr Hudson's appointment reinforces the already close links between the MCA and the drugs industry. But the denial did little to assuage the concern of consumer groups or parliamentary critics. Dr Keith Jones, the chief executive at the MCA to whom Dr Hudson reports, was recruited from another drugs giant, the US firm of Merck, Sharpe and Dohme Rahway.</p> <p>Drug regulation is a highly technical operation, requiring both scientific and legal expertise. An application for a new licence involves mountains of data - sufficient to fill 60 old box files, though now it is on disks. There are only two places to find people with sufficient expertise: the industry or the MCA. Ministers should insist that the MCA, which has a staff of several hundred, \"grows\" its own executives - as it has done in the past. Recruiting them from the very industry it is supposed to be regulating undermines its independence.</p> <p>A second reform is to make the procedure more open. The British procedure has been bedevilled by secrecy. In the US, patients have a right to know why a new medicine has been licensed, the results of clinical studies undertaken (including \"lethal doses\"), and the side-effects, such as dependency, which have emerged. In the UK, secrecy still rules. It is a criminal offence for licensing officials to disclose any information about their decisions. Even data sheets on side-effects are withheld. A new - and more open - medicines act is long overdue.</p>",

The new director, Dr Ian Hudson, is a former top executive at SmithKline Beecham, which with its merger this week with Glaxo Wellcome, is now the world's biggest pharmaceutical company. The MCA rejected suggestions that Dr Hudson's appointment reinforces the already close links between the MCA and the drugs industry. But the denial did little to assuage the concern of consumer groups or parliamentary critics. Dr Keith Jones, the chief executive at the MCA to whom Dr Hudson reports, was recruited from another drugs giant, the US firm of Merck, Sharpe and Dohme Rahway. Drug regulation is a highly technical operation, requiring both scientific and legal expertise. An application for a new licence involves mountains of data - sufficient to fill 60 old box files, though now it is on disks. There are only two places to find people with sufficient expertise: the industry or the MCA. Ministers should insist that the MCA, which has a staff of several hundred, \"grows\" its own executives - as it has done in the past. Recruiting them from the very industry it is supposed to be regulating undermines its independence. A second reform is to make the procedure more open. The British procedure has been bedevilled by secrecy. In the US, patients have a right to know why a new medicine has been licensed, the results of clinical studies undertaken (including \"lethal doses\"), and the side-effects, such as dependency, which have emerged. In the UK, secrecy still rules. It is a criminal offence for licensing officials to disclose any information about their decisions. Even data sheets on side-effects are withheld. A new - and more open - medicines act is long overdue.",

      "body": "<p>Willard Van Orman Quine, who has died aged 92, was arguably the greatest American philosopher of the second half of the 20th century. He revolutionised developments in epistemology, metaphysics, logic, philosophy of language and philosophy of maths.</p> <p>In 1951, his article Two Dogmas Of Empiricism caused a furore in the philosophical world. It challenged received notions of knowledge, meaning and truth, and exceeded even the extreme empiricism of logical positivism by arguing that logic and maths, like factual statements, are open to revision in the light of experience.</p> <p>Experience, added Quine, does not confirm or falsify individual statements, but instead confronts an interlocking theory-laden system of statements, which has to be adjusted as a whole. And there cannot be any universally-held system of beliefs, he argued in his major work Word And Object (1960), since the way any theory describes the world is relative to that theory's linguistic background.</p> <p>Quine revised and clarified such theses in more than 20 books and numerous articles, all written in a distinctive crisp, witty style. He taught at Harvard from 1936 - becoming a full professor in 1948 - until his retirement in 1978, and lectured all over the world.</p> <p>The youngest son of an engineer, Quine was born in \"a modest frame house\" in Akron, Ohio. He chose scientific courses at his local high school. An ardent stamp collector and list-maker, he was fascinated by etymology, and obsessed with maps and faraway places. His interest in philosophy began when, aged nine, he became worried by the absurdity of heaven and hell, and only stopped being worried about the dangerousness of his doubts when he realised that they might be justified.</p> <p>Late in high school his brother, already a student at Oberlin College, gave him William James's Pragmatism, which he read compulsively, along with Swami Vivekananda's Raja Yoga. But he always said it was reading Eureka, a short story by Edgar Allen Poe, when aged 14, that first filled him with a desire to understand the universe.</p> <p>When he went to Oberlin, a fellow poker-player told him about a philosopher of mathematics called Bertrand Russell, and he decided to major in maths, with philosophy of mathematics as a supplement. Quine's years at Oberlin were idyllic. His rooming house, full of kindred spirits, was \"an ideal setting in which to wax articulate\". His \"appetite for cosmic understanding\" was sharpened by reading Russell.</p> <p>In the summer of 1928 he and two friends crossed the continent, jumping on to moving boxcars, and spending nights on benches or in prisons. He also found time, somewhat reluctantly, to marry a fellow-student.</p> <p>Quine was awarded a scholarship to Harvard, where he did a PhD in only two years. During his first year, Bertrand Russell gave a lecture, and afterwards Alfred Whitehead (who had co-written Principia Mathematica with him) introduced Russell to the young philosopher, leading to an exchange of books and letters. The following year, Quine visited Europe on a travelling fellowship, and met members of the Vienna Circle (the anti-metaphysical Logical Positivists), their British disciple AJ Ayer, and the young Kurt G\u00f6del, who had just produced his renowned incompleteness theorem.</p> <p>The next three months were \"intellectually the most rewarding\" of his life - six weeks in Warsaw with Alfred Tarski and other innovatory Polish logicians, and six in Prague, where, taken up by the prime logical positivist Rudolf Carnap, Quine discovered what it was to be \"intellectually fired by a living teacher rather than by a dead book\". They conducted endless discussions together in German, and Quine was lent the typescript of the book Carnap was writing, handed to him sheaf by sheaf from the typewriter as Carnap's wife Ina typed it. He became Carnap's \"ardent disciple\", and although they were to become increasingly combative philosophically, they remained firm friends.</p> <p>Quine returned to a junior fellowship at Harvard and to the publication of his thesis - his first book, A System Of Logistics. During the 1930s he developed his ideas in many articles, mainly on logic and set theory (most distinctively propounded in New Foundations Of Mathematics, 1937, and Mathematical Logic, 1940), and on existence and ontology. On What There Is (1948) contained his famous typically succinct formula: \"To be is to be the value of a variable.\"</p> <p>When Carnap visited Harvard in 1940, Quine and Tarski (also visiting) challenged him on the view crucial to logical positivism that, while most of what we say is verified or falsified by experience, there are some statements (in logic and mathematics) that are necessarily true come what may, by virtue of the meaning of their terms. (This was the only way the positivists could cater for the fact that the latter sort of statements are so obviously incapable of being tested by experience.)</p> <p>In his seminal Two Dogmas Of Empiricism, however, Quine declared it \"folly to seek a boundary between synthetic statements, which hold contingently on experience, and analytic statements, which hold come what may\". By denying the analytic-synthetic distinction, Quine made even the \"truths\" of logic and mathematics empirical. No longer the central planks around which our beliefs are arrayed, logical and mathematical statements can (in principle) be modified, even abandoned, in the light of experience, as factual statements are.</p> <p>This was heresy in all philosophical camps. What experience, it might be asked, could lead anyone remotely to query the apparently adamantine logical law of excluded middle (that every proposition is necessarily either true or not true, and each thing either has or lacks any given property)?</p> <p>Even that law might, said Quine, be revisable as a means of simplifying quantum mechanics, and so might the principle of causality. \"Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system [of our beliefs].\" For the \"totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from the most causal matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of atomic physics or even of pure mathematics and logic, is a manmade fabric which impinges on experience only along the edges\", so that \"a conflict with experience at the periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field\".</p> <p>But, said Quine, \"no particular experiences are linked with any particular statements in the interior of the field\", contrary to what empiricists had dogmatically assumed. Locke and Hume had held that the basic ingredients of our knowledge are sensory impressions (or the terms for them). For Bentham and later Frege, and the logical positivists, it was the individual statement, not the individual term, that was to be matched against experience.</p> <p>Quine argued that \"our statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually but only as a corporate body\". Since any observation sentence is theory-laden, the \"unit of empirical significance is the whole of science\".</p> <p>Later, Quine would argue for a more \"moderate holism\" in which not the whole of science, but sizeable chunks of it, were the units for empirical revision. And he urged the \"maxim of minimum mutilation\" in revising. But he always declared that philosophy and science were in the same boat, a boat which, as in Neurath's simile, we are forced to rebuild plank by plank while staying afloat in it. For \"there is no external vantage point, no first philosophy\" by which to remodel it from outside - it is never docked and crewless on dry land.</p> <p>Two Dogmas Of Empiricism established his reputation universally. It was published with other articles in From A Logical Point Of View (the title being suggested by a calypso number of Harry Belafonte's) in 1953, while Quine was Eastman professor at Oxford.</p> <p>Word And Object (1960) attacked prevailing philosophical theories which see meanings as objects in a museum of ideas, with verbal expressions as their arbitrary, interchangeable labels. Quine agreed with Wittgenstein and with the pragmatist John Dewey that language is a form of behaviour. He introduced the concept of an utterance's \"stimulus meaning\" - the set of stimulations which would prompt a person to assent to that utterance.</p> <p>But, he said, whereas assent and dissent are ascertainable in kindred or culturally similar languages, there is no guarantee that just because the speaker of a radically foreign language (\"Jungle\") always says \"Gavagai\" when a rabbit runs past, he means \"Rabbit\" or \"Lo, a rabbit\". The word could equally well mean \"undetached rabbit-part\" or \"rabbithood\", and a Jungle-speaker's assent or dissent in the presence of assorted stimulations proves inconclusive.</p> <p>The usual checks against other parts of a language are impossible, since they involve the use of parts of speech, identity concepts, and \"if thens\", which are also all up for grabs when translating Jungle into English. In such cases of \"radical translation\", different translators, working independently on Jungle, could thus produce quite divergent manuals of translation, each compatible with the totality of the native-speakers' verbal behaviour, but incompatible with one another. And furthermore, Quine argued, the reason for this is not that we can never know which of these translations is correct.</p> <p>The \"indeterminacy of translation\" he had diagnosed also involves \"the inscrutability of reference\". Since there is no language-independent meaning of \"Gavagai\" or any other expression, there is no determinate classification of what exists, only ontological relativity: what a theory says exists is relative to the manual of translation it uses.</p> <p>Quine's prolific output and obsession with travelling continued up to and beyond his retirement. He preferred to learn his audience's German, Spanish, Portuguese or whatever, and lecture in that rather than English. He was distinguished by his openness and generosity to students, acknowledging the \"close collaboration\" on Word and Object of Donald Davidson, then a Harvard classics student, later to be a renowned philosopher.</p> <p>Quine is often considered a behaviourist (someone who sees all mental life as nothing more than observable behaviour). Certainly he claimed that behaviourism is essential in linguistics, but he eventually adopted Davidson's anomalous monism, which holds that, although there is nothing over and above the physical, our mental states cannot neatly be identified with our brain states, or subsumed under physical laws.</p> <p>As for the immemorial problem of how we can know about the world around us, his \"naturalised epistemology\" relocated the problem as that of how we learn to talk about things. If there is any dualistic split, it is not that between mind and body, but between physical objects, including humans, and the concepts that refer to them.</p> <p>\"I have been accused of denying consciousness,\" Quine said, \"but I am not conscious of having done so.\" Indicatively, however, his 1985 autobiography, The Time Of My Life, is little more than a travel itinerary, so devoid of emotion and internality as almost to suggest not only that he had neither, but hardly even knew what they might be.</p> <p>Quine had many friends, a very happy second marriage, loved Dixieland jazz and played the banjo in jazz groups.

The case was brought on behalf of Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, described in the submissions as \"Caucasian residents of the state of Michigan\" who had applied unsuccessfully for admission between 1995 and 1997. The current admissions policy gives black, Latino and Native American students, students from poor backgrounds, and outstanding athletes, a 20-point bonus on a 150-point scale. At present 8% of the university's 38,000 students are black, 4% Latino and just under 1% Native American. This is double the number of minority students in 1988. The university justifies the policy on the grounds that all students benefit intellectually because heterogeneity promotes sharper critical thinking. Affirmative action, introduced in the wake of the civil rights movement to offset discrimination in education andemployment, has become a rallying point for conservative politicians. In 1996 the US court of appeals ruled against the University of Texas law school, which had implemented the policy. Other US universities then changed their admissions policies. But the University of Michigan, under its liberal president Lee Bollinger, continued with the policy, on the grounds stated in its defence submission, that diversity increased the intellectual vitality of its education, scholarship, service, and communal life. The policy was only examined in detail when a university professor of philosophy, Carl Cohen, discovered it and publicised it. People who felt they had been discriminated against were asked to identify themselves, and the centre began its action. Prof Cohen was backed by the conservative right while the university was supported by 20 of the world's best-known corporations, including Dow Chemicals, Procter and Gamble, Microsoft, Kelloggs, Eastman Kodak and Texaco. The latest decision and the one in January will almost certainly be taken to appeal, probably as far as the supreme court. The litigation has been given an added frisson by the playing-out of the presidential election, which led many to conclude that the supreme court's decisions on such matters may be motivated as much by political allegiances as strict interpretation of the law.

In recent months fishermen on the archipelago where Charles Darwin developed his theories of evolution have also ransacked a research station and harassed tourists. The dispute centres on fishing for sharks and sea cucumbers and the islanders' wish to use modern techniques banned in Galapagos waters. \"We are resentful of the authorities because they don't let us fish,\" said Vincent Torres, a resident of Isabela island, the largest in the chain. \"They come and tell us that now we cannot do the same things we have done for a lifetime.\" But conservationists are afraid that increased fishing will devastate one of the world's best-preserved areas of marine life. The archipelago, 600 miles west of the Ecuadorean mainland, has species of plants and animals, including the giant tortoise, not found elsewhere. Much of the turmoil stems from a 1998 law which gave residents more political autonomy but also set up a marine reserve extending 40 miles offshore. Within the reserve, only tourism and local small-scale fishing are permitted. The problem is also a consequence of the increasing population of the islands and the difficulty many face in trying to survive. In 1950 there were 1,000 islanders. Now there are 16,000, and the number is rising by 6% a year, despite efforts to curb it. The fishermen have powerful allies in Ecuador's commercial fishing industry. \"I am in agreement with the demonstrations of discontent by the fishermen, because it is tourism and the increased population on the islands that are harming the ecosystem,\" said Cesar Rohon, president of Ecuador's national chamber of fishing trade. \"To administer fishing one must understand it, and the government does not know what resources are available in the Galapagos,\" he added. \"The ecologists, who have international support, don't know what to do with those resources.\" Fernando Espinoza, executive director of the Charles Darwin Foundation research centre, said wider commercial interests were behind the protests. \"We know there are people who have offered to buy entire catches of lobster, sea cucumbers and shark fins from the fishermen of the Galapagos islands. It is a tremendous business,\" he said. It is a business that has attracted more fishermen from Ecuador's mostly poor mainland population. This year 939 took part in the Galapagos lobster catch - almost double the number registered a year earlier. The increase not only depleted the lobster population at a dangerous rate, it also decreased annual earnings for each fisherman, the Darwin Centre said. It also made other catches on the islands, including shark fins and sea cucumbers, more attractive. Shark fins are a delicacy in many Asian countries and fetch as much as \u00a366 a kilo. The fishermen can sell the sea cucumbers, which are crucial to the shallow water ecosystem, for 60p a piece. \"Fishermen who can get a couple of thousand sea cucumbers are doing as well as a dope dealer selling cocaine on the mainland,\" said John McCosker, chairman of aquatic biology at the California Academy of Sciences. Last month, under pressure from the fishermen, the government raised the lobster limit from 50 to 80 tonnes. Environmentalists said it was \"institutionalising blackmail\". Mr McCosker said: \"It's tragic, the short-term gain of a few fishermen versus the long-term survival of the Galapagos. They are killing the golden goose.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Britain in Europe campaign is to pile pressure on the government to join a single currency by staging its own assessment of the Treasury's five economic tests. But the group - which has close links with Downing Street - has agreed to lay off hard campaigning on the currency until after the general election. It has agreed with pro-Europe ministers and trade unionists on what is being described as a flyover strategy for the election itself. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, has said he will make the Treasury's assessment of the five economic tests soon after the election, but has not set a date. With some economists claiming the tests are largely subjective, there has been a suspicion that if the government felt a referendum could not be won, the Treasury would conclude the tests had not been met. Some ministers believe the authority of a second term Labour government would be exploded if it went for a referendum and lost. Britain in Europe's decision to set up a panel of economists to assess the tests will unnerve the Treasury. The conclusions of any such panel are bound to be taken seriously. If it said the tests were met, a Labour government's ability to recommend rejection would be much more difficult. The five tests ask whether membership would be good for jobs and investment, and whether the British and European economies have reached long term sustainable convergence. Throughout its short life, the business-backed campaign has been under pressure from Downing Street not to demand that a Labour government take sterling into the euro. This has led to tensions with pro-European Conservatives, such as Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke. Instead the campaign has a platform for Britain to join a successful single currency when the time is ripe. Its senior members are determined to abandon their self-restraint after the election. In a sign of intent, its chief economist, Kitty Ussher, claimed yesterday that the volatility of sterling outside the euro was a factor in 41,262 job losses this year - a figure representing the sum of all announcements of manufacturing job losses in Britain in which volatility between the pound and the euro was cited as a factor behind the decision. If the effect on the supply chain were taken into account, as many as 66,000 jobs could have been lost in 2000, wholly or partly due to sterling's position outside the euro.",

With its population projected to rise by 50,000 to 490,000 in the next 14 years - and the likelihood of 25,000 new jobs in the next four years alone - land in a redesignated green belt has been earmarked for a 21st century \"new town\". The wedge between the Craigmiller housing scheme and Dalkeith, Midlothian, a joint venture between the city council and a local developer, could house 20,000 by 2020. With schools, shopping centre and modern transport links to the city, the 1,400 hectare (3,500 acre) area underlines the pressure facing the city. Edinburgh is designated a world heritage site and thus protected from rash development, so there is precious little building land left. As a result, demand is growing for the release of more green belt. \"There is not a patch of land which developers do not have an option on, so we are trying to consolidate expansion to protect the rest of the city,\" said Mr Anderson. \"We don't want to lose the big attraction of Edinburgh that you can be in open countryside after driving just 10 minutes from the city centre.\" To maintain a level of prosperity which has brought Edinburgh a new financial district in its west end - helping to swell funds under management to \u00a3350bn - the city will increasingly have to look beyond its borders for workers. Last month plans were unveiled to reopen part of a railway line linking Edinburgh with the Scottish Borders - emerging commuter territory - which closed 30 years ago. Councillors hope the line could reopen by 2008, under a public-private partnership, after the Scottish parliament passes a special order. While talk of a Scottish \"home counties\" might be premature, businesspeople and councillors in Edinburgh believe more commuting will be needed to service the growing economy. Many people are being priced out of the housing market, while 20,000 are on the council waiting list for rented homes. Simon Fairclough, marketing director of the Edinburgh Solicitors Property Centre, said: \"Builders are selling off the drawing board.\" Some properties in the new town go for over \u00a31m. Ray Perman, chief executive of Scottish financial enterprise, said many big institutions were moving to Edinburgh. \"They have seen overheating in London, and the difficulty of getting good quality people...English money is moving up here.\" Related story: Pressures build for rich and poor alike in the new boom towns",

      "body": "<p>Gordon Frank Newman trawls back half a century. He was six years old, walking home, his shirt stuffed with pears. \"I had been given them by a man further up the road who had trees in his garden, and I was actually going past an orchard when a policeman came down the lane and stopped and said: 'What've you got there?' and I said: 'Nothing'. He called me a liar and clomped me round the ears and took the pears and got back in his car and went. I danced across the road, saw stars. I suppose that is where it started.\" </p> <p>Newman didn't know the blow had left him deaf in his right ear. He didn't even tell his parents about the incident. The boy who turned into the man who has spent four decades exploring injustice within the justice system, simply got on with life. \"Looking back on those circumstances, you see that police do that all the time. Jump to conclusions.\" </p> <p>GF Newman first gained recognition for his crime novels. The first, Sir, You Bastard, sold 200,000 copies. But he really made his name with a landmark television series in the late 1970s. Its title couldn't have been a more literal statement of his concerns. Law and Order changed the landscape both of cop shows and British TV. It wasn't so much a drama as an expos\u00e9. The performances and mood of the four films, directed with spartan vigour by Les Blair, made you think it had to be real, had to be documentary. A new word was invented to describe Law and Order - faction. Just as radical as the style was the subject matter - Newman showed a police force identical to the criminals they trailed but for the badges. </p> <p>Young Newman was a bright lad, enthusiastic for life, inquisitive, slightly dyslexic, bored by school. His background was comfortable; dad a structural engineer, mum a housewife. He lived his childhood in his head, fantasising about making a difference, saving the world, being the Superman of St Mary Cray in Kent. \"I was the person who'd go in to change the situation and, having righted it, would move on.\" </p> <p>He spent a good deal of time bunking off school, smoking with friends when they should have been in class. At 16, he decided to be a movie star and went to a Stanislavsky acting school in Chistelhurst, but it didn't really have time for stars. It was more interested in observation, character, immersion than celebrity. At drama school he wrote a script that was accepted for a cop series. </p> <p>It wasn't until two decades after the pear incident that Newman again came into contact with the police. He was 24, living in Mayfair, London, and the anti-Vietnam demonstrators were marching past his home near Grosvenor Square. He was as curious as he was naive. \"It was jam packed, heaving and the police were charging the crowd on horses. Yet the crowd were equally outrageous because a lot of them had weapons and were stabbing the flanks of the horses. I wasn't aware of animal rights then, but I was outraged.\" </p> <p>Newman sits at his BBC desk in White City, back straight, arms crossed, one hand buried in his pocket, the other bearing a red band round his wrist. \"It's red energy, red always draws energy, so if you're feeling tired put on a red shirt,\" he says. He looks smart in a pristine way - cotton suit, white shirt. To his side is a neat row of tangerines, a couple of apples and tomatoes, and a carton of organic apple juice - lunch. He is tall, and his face, his stance, his whole demeanour suggest an ascetic life. </p> <p>The actor Martin Shaw remembers the first time he met him: \"I was startled by him, his physical presence is startling. It was 1989, and he was completely bald, and it wasn't commonplace then. He had these extraordinary piercing blue eyes, and a candour and directness bordering on the alien. His mental frame is echoed by his physical frame - he's as straight as you can get.\" Shaw, who starred in Newman's For the Greater Good and is the eponymous hero of his new TV drama, Judge John Deed, calls him an extraordinarily good man, and apologises if he sounds pious. \"He has a blazing integrity, in his care for people, his humanity - towards people and animals.\" </p> <p>That blazing integrity certainly emerged in Law and Order. What was most astonishing about the series of films was Newman's sense of process, of how things were done. Many people asked how Newman knew so much about the law. Most presumed that he was an insider. Ken Campbell, who appeared in Law and Order, says that throughout the filming he never met Newman. \"There were lots of rumours that he was an ex-copper, that he had lost an arm, all types of things. Some time later I met him and I was so surprised. I was expecting him to be some kind of heavy, a big Bob Hoskins. But he was so charming, so lightweight, so caring. He's a vegan isn't he?\" </p> <p>The Newman mythology was partly self-created. At a question and answer session at the National Film Theatre after Law and Order was screened, he told the audience that he had been a detective for 14 years and had served 12 years in prison for corruption. He was barely 30 at the time, though his long straggling beard did its best to hide his age. \"I thought I was being clever, and that they would just do some smart arithmetic and realise that would have made me about 78. It came back to haunt me.\" </p> <p>This was not the only time he has fictionalised his life. Like Len Deighton, he created different characters for the author of his books. One time he was a father of seven, another time a pimp. \"I was inventing the expert who had the authority to write this book.\" </p> <p>In truth, Newman was simply a writer who knew the value of research. His writing was as complex, at times as wordy, as the law itself. Les Blair says that the first time he read the script he thought it was over the top. \"I thought this can't be true. I'd hardly ever spoken to a policeman and was reading all this stuff about the process of law and how the wheels were greased, and I was shocked by it.\" </p> <p>Newman introduced him to contacts in the police and the underworld. They went out drinking, talked about scams, learned the tricks of the trade. \"We'd go out on pub crawls on alternate nights, with villains and policemen. I ended up pouring a lot of booze into potted plants because I couldn't keep up with either of them,\" Blair says. \"It really was an eye opener. \"That's when I learned that coppers were sensible villains, and villains didn't have the sense to be coppers.\" </p> <p>Officers were offered about a tenner a go, says Blair, to pretend to arrest the set designer and bring him to Scotland Yard so he could recreate it convincingly. </p> <p>Law and Order duly caused an outcry. Questions were asked in the House of Commons. How could the BBC show our decent police to be so corrupt? asked the right. How are we going to tackle this shocking corruption? asked the left. </p> <p>Newman's partner, Rebecca Hall, who writes about animal rights, converted him to vegetarianism in the 70s. He'd bought himself a little farm in Ireland, was friendly with the local farmer and his calves, and noticed how every six months a truck would call for them and take them away. It was Rebecca who told him they were going off for slaughter. He'd not worked it out for himself? \"I'd never really thought where they went. I suppose like so many people I just blanked it out.\" Newman and Rebecca have been together for 27 years. She has two grown-up children, one a barrister who writes and the other an archaeologist who also writes. He helped bring them up as his own. </p> <p>Hall and Newman divide their time between London and Hereford, where he bought a former school which he converted into flats. He keeps a huge chunk of it and the land for himself, his family and the animals - at one point they had 16 cats, five dogs and a couple of horses. His radicalism has always been allied to a good business sense: as a young man, he made money doing a variety of jobs, (including working for his father as a talented, if untrained, engineer). He used the money to buy himself a Mayfair flat, sold that and made himself a nice profit. His philosophy is simple: \"Business is simple. You buy a piece of cloth, cut it in half and sell each piece for the same price you bought the original for.\" </p> <p>He has continued to research his stories tirelessly. When he wrote The Nation's Health, again filmed by Les Blair, he worked for months in several hospitals as a trainee nurse, trailing doctors on ward rounds, in admin, in the kitchens. Blair had begun to see a change in him. By now Newman was an ardent follower of John Todd Ferrier, a minister who married Christianity with vegetarianism and a spiritualism usually allied to eastern religions. Like Ferrier, Newman believed in the concepts of reincarnation and karma. Blair was surprised to find that Newman had written a drama which offered new age solutions. \"I knew him as the guy who had written Law and Order, and now he was talking about this healing thing. He was only mildly messianic with me. I think the way he operated with me was that he thought there were certain truths and he assumed other people would recognise them, rather than him running around trying to persuade me.\" </p> <p>By the 80s, Newman had become a militant vegan. \"I'd pick arguments.I'd walk into butcher's shops and berate people. I'd pull across trucks carrying chickens to slaughter. I'd go to the airfields when they were flying veal to Europe.\" He told people that if they didn't respect the rights of animals, it was as bad as not respecting the rights of women, children and black people. He still believes that, and condemns the Christian church for compartmentalising compassion. \"It says you can exploit the animals on the one hand and be a Christian, be compassionate, on the other. You can't do that, though. It's what the Nazis were doing to the Jews and the gypsies and the homosexuals. They were slaughtering them in the morning and going home in the afternoon and pretending to be loving parents. And that's just not possible. Compassion is all consuming.\" He often compares the killing of animals to the Holocaust. When he talks about vegetarianism he lectures and harangues. He believes it is his duty to do so. </p> <p>Most people presumed Newman was a hard-line leftwinger. But he has always claimed he wasn't interested in left and right. He doesn't even vote. \"If I were to think that Tony Blair or William Hague or whoever runs the Liber als were the solution then I'd be totally lost. The political structure just does not deliver. All politicians are self-seeking.\" But a ballot ignored can deliver genocide. Would he have voted against Hitler? He says he's not sure, turns back to the \"animal genocide\" that surrounds us, and repeats that it is crass to prioritise one form of genocide over another. </p> <p>Somehow it takes a while to notice Newman's left hand. Perhaps because it spends a good deal of time in his pocket. Part of the palm and two and a half fingers are missing. \"I just used to make bombs,\" he says casually. \"I was about 11 I think... it was quite shocking. I was making them in the garden shed.\" This must have been another defining moment in his childhood. Certainly an event that turned him away from violence. Why was he making bombs? \"I wish I had an answer to that. I expect I was curious and destructive.\" The fingers were in pieces, splattered on the shed walls. He didn't cry because he couldn't feel anything. The shock numbed him. </p> <p>Ruth Caleb, his executive producer, says what attracted her to him was his integrity, the moral principle that underlines everything he does. But it has also very nearly been his undoing after he started to produce his own work so he could dictate the catering. In 1996 there was mutiny on the set of Black and Blue, another exploration of police corruption. \"The nemesis came a week and a half into the shoot when the troops had had enough of the vegetarian food. They wanted a choice.\" </p> <p>Newman remembers getting a call from Caleb pleading with him to compromise. \"She said: 'You've got to have meat', and I said: 'Well, fuck, I don't do the show'.\" Newman rarely swears. \"I was prepared to walk out.\" </p> <p>After all, he says, if he was having people round to his house, he would not serve meat or fish. As producer, he was buying the food, in effect playing host, so why should he betray his vegetarianism? The tabloids had a riot. The Sun compared him to Goebbels. In the end Newman steamed up to Liverpool to argue his case. </p> <p>\"He spoke to everyone, said you've all agreed to the food, reinvigorated them, and we carried on with the vegetarian shoot,\" Caleb says. \"In another life I think Gordon would have been a prophet or a disciple. No, he would have definitely been a prophet.\" </p> <p>Ken Trodd, who produced For The Greater Good, says Newman has become more and more controlling over the years. \"I love Gordon, but it's so hard not to sound comic when talking about him.\" He recalls the time when Newman received his Bafta's writer award. \"Gordon called me, and said I take it there will be at least one vegan table. I said I'm sure that'll be fine. Next thing I get a call from him asking whether the whole event couldn't be vegan. I suppose there's a hubristic sense of always asking for one more thing, however outrageous it may seem - not that it seems outrageous to Gordon. There is a sense of his wanting to control the world he has access to.\" After the Bafta food, came the speech. The event was live, and Bafta organisers were worried that Newman would may go on for ever. They asked Trodd to have a quiet word in his ear. \"So I told Gordon there was some concern about how long he was going to speak. He told me not to worry because he'd been working on it and he'd managed to get it down to 13 minutes.\" He says that's typical Newman. </p> <p>Is working with Newman really such a nightmare? Ruth Caleb says: \"I look at it the other way round. You have a talented writer, a bit of a legend, who is also an individual as a producer. God knows there are few enough individuals around, and I think the crew are fortunate to be able to work with a writer who cares so passionately about things. And if they really wanted bacon butties they could have brought their own.\" </p> <p>\"As long as they didn't eat them near me,\" Newman says. </p> <p>He admits there were times when he became overly aggressive. Not only did he refuse to share a table with meat-eaters but he became much more evangelical about his spiritual beliefs. This apparently gentle, compassionate man started to say things that sounded anything but compassionate. He believes that in this life, as in every life, we are paying off a debt. In short, and at its most simplistic, victims of crime, prejudice, ill health, even - by implication - police brutality, must have done something in a previous existence to deserve it. In one interview, he seemed to suggest that victims of the Holocaust were partly to blame because they had a victim mentality. Not surprisingly, many people took offence. </p> <p>Newman stands by his karma. \"There is always some connection between the victim and the victimiser, otherwise why is it that person? I can't tell you what that connection is, but there is a connection. Everything is cause and effect. It's a huge subject and if I had all the answers wouldn't it be wonderful? I believe we're all working off karmic debt through our actions and accumulating more debt in this life.\" He takes as an example illness - there's always a cause. Newman has not been to a conventional doctor for 25 years. In that time, he says, he has suffered only colds, and one persistent headache that was cured by the application of rice water. </p> <p>But he can understand why people were upset by what he seemed to be saying about Holocaust victims. \"I did take issue with the person who wrote that article because I didn't actually say that. It looked like I was saying they were to blame.\" So how did it misrepresent him? \"Because it's so deeply unkind. Writing off six million people in a very unkind sentence. I can't say they deserved that, that's outrageous.\" So what had he actually said? \"I can't remember.\" </p> <p>Martin Shaw says one of the reasons he gets on so well with Newman is that they share so many beliefs, both spiritual and political. Although Newman may deny it, Shaw sees him as instinctively coming from the left. Like Newman, Shaw has also been vegetarian for 30 years. He is also in sympathy with Newman's views on reincarnation. \"Now this is a very difficult, emotive subject. As Glenn Hoddle found out, you can't deal with it in one sentence, and if you do you're asking to be pounced upon. I agree with both Glenn and Gordon. But this is the paradox that the western mind finds so hard to reconcile - that it is simultaneously possible to know that everything is destined and has a balance and a reason because of everything that's happened in a previous life, but we have to behave as though we have control over our destiny. People in the west find it difficult to accept that both conditions can be true. I think Gordon is one of the most well adjusted and clear people I've met.\" </p> <p>Newman insists that his beliefs are not a recipe for inaction, but the opposite. It is our duty, he says, to help people, to do our best, because that is the way we pay off our debt. </p> <p>Newman eventually realised he was losing friends. \"For a large part of the 80s I didn't go out to dinner.\" Not surprising - he must have been terrible company. \"That's right, that's right.\" Did it upset Rebecca that his intolerance was destroying their social life? \"Well it did, yes. She said, you know you might have more influence on these people by being with them.\" He says Rebecca has always been a steadying influence on him. \"I just realised I was shutting out a lot of my life, a lot of people. And sometimes wisdom best testifies in silence. It's better to be quiet and just be an example.\" </p> <p>When he made Black and Blue, which showed police officers cooking live villains in the local crematorium, some of his supporters argued that he had gone too far. But, of course, this wasn't the first time that had been said about his work. \"Why do people find it easy to believe that policemen in South Africa or South America kill people, but that they'd never do it here? What makes us so special?\" He claims it was a detective who told him about the cremations. </p> <p>There were other problems, not least when he was sued by the freelance investigative journalist Duncan Campbell [not the Guardian reporter] over his portrayal of a cross-dressing, kleptomaniac hack in his TV drama Here is the News. Newman has always insisted the journalist was not based on Campbell, but it cost the BBC \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>In recent years Newman has fallen out of fashion. Television no longer has space for serious dramas, especially ones riddled with complex argument. Back in the 70s he, Alan Bleasdale and Dennis Potter were the television dramatists. Today, the man on reception at the BBC doesn't seem to have heard of GF Newman. Some people are surprised he is still alive. </p> <p>Les Blair says: \"People are not interested in that kind of dynamic anymore. People just don't like investigative drama. There's no place for it in the BBC, which is a great shame.\" </p> <p>Martin Shaw thinks this is more true of the TV executives than the population at large. \"It's not the public's fault. Their ability to understand hasn't changed, but television is now run by accountants who take no risk. Excellence is judged by ratings, not how good the product is. Not by how innovative or how challenging or how informative it is, but simply by how much we beat the other side.\" </p> <p>In the late 80s Newman cast the film-maker Michael Winner in The Greater Good as a businessman trying to convince the home secretary to let him run private prisons. \"It was beautifully written, and if I say so myself I was incredibly good in it,\" Winner says. It was his first serious acting role. \"That was like a fantasy in those days, but it came to be true; they did privatise prisons. And that's one of Newman's great qualities - he puts his finger on where things are going politically.\" Winner, not a man renowned for adhering to Reithian principles, believes that the BBC has dumbed down considerably since then. \"You'd be hard pressed to get three hour-long episodes of a political drama on TV now.\" </p> <p>Newman knows he's not as popular as he was, but he never trusted it when he was flavour of the day. Nothing has really changed, he says. He used to plough a lonely furrow and still does. \"I never needed popularity to validate my existence.\" So he can still get the programmes made that he wants to? \"No, is the truth. I've had shows that haven't gone for whatever reason, and I always presumed it was because they weren't good enough, but you look at some of the stuff on the television and think well I don't know...\" He says these days TV is more schematic, pure sensation. \"I'm not admiring of what I see around me, I'm not saying 'Gosh, I wish I'd made that'.\" Occasionally he sees films at the cinema - The Insider, say, or Shine - that he wishes he'd written. </p> <p>But Newman has not given up. Next week, Judge John Deed, a pilot for a commissioned series, will be shown on BBC1. Again, it stars Martin Shaw, and once again the subject is law and order. John Deed is a a good man doing his best not to be corrupted by a conflict of interest. It's entertaining, warm and rather soft for Newman. There will be no questions asked in the house about Judge John Deed. </p> <p>Martin Shaw loves the character he plays, but still has reservations. \"I think Gordon will forgive me if I say we had vehement discussions. I would have wanted him to be his old radical self. I think there are areas where he has made it too easy for the audience, too mainstream. When you have Gordon Newman's name on something you have a genre expectation and I think with John Deed he has pulled back slightly from that expectation. Actually it's not so much to do with the radical nature, more to do with over-explaining - what we'd call dumbing down. I thought there were areas where we could have been more grown up, not nannied the audience so much.\" Meanwhile, Newman says Judge John Deed is not about dumbing down, it's about his personal evolution. There was a time when he simply wanted to expose foul play, now he wants solutions. He says he has become more aspirational over the years. </p> <p>\"I would like people to look at John Deed and think 'Gosh, if I ever got into trouble and ended up in court I'd like to be in front of this man'.\" And that, he says is a change in his writing and a change in himself. \"One has to change, bringing the light to the areas of darkness. First you go behind the closed doors into the secret rooms of the police and hospitals, you open them up and shine some light in. Then the next stage is taking the people on the journey from wanting to be in the dark, to the light; from bad to good.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance:</strong> Gordon Frank Newman </p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> May 22 1946. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Edgbury secondary, Chistlehurst.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Frank Newman trawls back half a century. He was six years old, walking home, his shirt stuffed with pears. \"I had been given them by a man further up the road who had trees in his garden, and I was actually going past an orchard when a policeman came down the lane and stopped and said: 'What've you got there?' and I said: 'Nothing'. He called me a liar and clomped me round the ears and took the pears and got back in his car and went. I danced across the road, saw stars. I suppose that is where it started.\" Newman didn't know the blow had left him deaf in his right ear. He didn't even tell his parents about the incident. The boy who turned into the man who has spent four decades exploring injustice within the justice system, simply got on with life. \"Looking back on those circumstances, you see that police do that all the time. Jump to conclusions.\" GF Newman first gained recognition for his crime novels. The first, Sir, You Bastard, sold 200,000 copies. But he really made his name with a landmark television series in the late 1970s. Its title couldn't have been a more literal statement of his concerns. Law and Order changed the landscape both of cop shows and British TV. It wasn't so much a drama as an expos\u00e9. The performances and mood of the four films, directed with spartan vigour by Les Blair, made you think it had to be real, had to be documentary. A new word was invented to describe Law and Order - faction. Just as radical as the style was the subject matter - Newman showed a police force identical to the criminals they trailed but for the badges. Young Newman was a bright lad, enthusiastic for life, inquisitive, slightly dyslexic, bored by school. His background was comfortable; dad a structural engineer, mum a housewife. He lived his childhood in his head, fantasising about making a difference, saving the world, being the Superman of St Mary Cray in Kent. \"I was the person who'd go in to change the situation and, having righted it, would move on.\" He spent a good deal of time bunking off school, smoking with friends when they should have been in class. At 16, he decided to be a movie star and went to a Stanislavsky acting school in Chistelhurst, but it didn't really have time for stars. It was more interested in observation, character, immersion than celebrity. At drama school he wrote a script that was accepted for a cop series. It wasn't until two decades after the pear incident that Newman again came into contact with the police. He was 24, living in Mayfair, London, and the anti-Vietnam demonstrators were marching past his home near Grosvenor Square. He was as curious as he was naive. \"It was jam packed, heaving and the police were charging the crowd on horses. Yet the crowd were equally outrageous because a lot of them had weapons and were stabbing the flanks of the horses. I wasn't aware of animal rights then, but I was outraged.\" Newman sits at his BBC desk in White City, back straight, arms crossed, one hand buried in his pocket, the other bearing a red band round his wrist. \"It's red energy, red always draws energy, so if you're feeling tired put on a red shirt,\" he says. He looks smart in a pristine way - cotton suit, white shirt. To his side is a neat row of tangerines, a couple of apples and tomatoes, and a carton of organic apple juice - lunch. He is tall, and his face, his stance, his whole demeanour suggest an ascetic life. The actor Martin Shaw remembers the first time he met him: \"I was startled by him, his physical presence is startling. It was 1989, and he was completely bald, and it wasn't commonplace then. He had these extraordinary piercing blue eyes, and a candour and directness bordering on the alien. His mental frame is echoed by his physical frame - he's as straight as you can get.\" Shaw, who starred in Newman's For the Greater Good and is the eponymous hero of his new TV drama, Judge John Deed, calls him an extraordinarily good man, and apologises if he sounds pious. \"He has a blazing integrity, in his care for people, his humanity - towards people and animals.\" That blazing integrity certainly emerged in Law and Order. What was most astonishing about the series of films was Newman's sense of process, of how things were done. Many people asked how Newman knew so much about the law. Most presumed that he was an insider. Ken Campbell, who appeared in Law and Order, says that throughout the filming he never met Newman. \"There were lots of rumours that he was an ex-copper, that he had lost an arm, all types of things. Some time later I met him and I was so surprised. I was expecting him to be some kind of heavy, a big Bob Hoskins. But he was so charming, so lightweight, so caring. He's a vegan isn't he?\" The Newman mythology was partly self-created. At a question and answer session at the National Film Theatre after Law and Order was screened, he told the audience that he had been a detective for 14 years and had served 12 years in prison for corruption. He was barely 30 at the time, though his long straggling beard did its best to hide his age. \"I thought I was being clever, and that they would just do some smart arithmetic and realise that would have made me about 78. It came back to haunt me.\" This was not the only time he has fictionalised his life. Like Len Deighton, he created different characters for the author of his books. One time he was a father of seven, another time a pimp. \"I was inventing the expert who had the authority to write this book.\" In truth, Newman was simply a writer who knew the value of research. His writing was as complex, at times as wordy, as the law itself. Les Blair says that the first time he read the script he thought it was over the top. \"I thought this can't be true. I'd hardly ever spoken to a policeman and was reading all this stuff about the process of law and how the wheels were greased, and I was shocked by it.\" Newman introduced him to contacts in the police and the underworld. They went out drinking, talked about scams, learned the tricks of the trade. \"We'd go out on pub crawls on alternate nights, with villains and policemen. I ended up pouring a lot of booze into potted plants because I couldn't keep up with either of them,\" Blair says. \"It really was an eye opener. \"That's when I learned that coppers were sensible villains, and villains didn't have the sense to be coppers.\" Officers were offered about a tenner a go, says Blair, to pretend to arrest the set designer and bring him to Scotland Yard so he could recreate it convincingly. Law and Order duly caused an outcry. Questions were asked in the House of Commons. How could the BBC show our decent police to be so corrupt? asked the right. How are we going to tackle this shocking corruption? asked the left. Newman's partner, Rebecca Hall, who writes about animal rights, converted him to vegetarianism in the 70s. He'd bought himself a little farm in Ireland, was friendly with the local farmer and his calves, and noticed how every six months a truck would call for them and take them away. It was Rebecca who told him they were going off for slaughter. He'd not worked it out for himself? \"I'd never really thought where they went. I suppose like so many people I just blanked it out.\" Newman and Rebecca have been together for 27 years. She has two grown-up children, one a barrister who writes and the other an archaeologist who also writes. He helped bring them up as his own. Hall and Newman divide their time between London and Hereford, where he bought a former school which he converted into flats. He keeps a huge chunk of it and the land for himself, his family and the animals - at one point they had 16 cats, five dogs and a couple of horses. His radicalism has always been allied to a good business sense: as a young man, he made money doing a variety of jobs, (including working for his father as a talented, if untrained, engineer). He used the money to buy himself a Mayfair flat, sold that and made himself a nice profit. His philosophy is simple: \"Business is simple. You buy a piece of cloth, cut it in half and sell each piece for the same price you bought the original for.\" He has continued to research his stories tirelessly. When he wrote The Nation's Health, again filmed by Les Blair, he worked for months in several hospitals as a trainee nurse, trailing doctors on ward rounds, in admin, in the kitchens. Blair had begun to see a change in him. By now Newman was an ardent follower of John Todd Ferrier, a minister who married Christianity with vegetarianism and a spiritualism usually allied to eastern religions. Like Ferrier, Newman believed in the concepts of reincarnation and karma. Blair was surprised to find that Newman had written a drama which offered new age solutions. \"I knew him as the guy who had written Law and Order, and now he was talking about this healing thing. He was only mildly messianic with me. I think the way he operated with me was that he thought there were certain truths and he assumed other people would recognise them, rather than him running around trying to persuade me.\" By the 80s, Newman had become a militant vegan. \"I'd pick arguments.I'd walk into butcher's shops and berate people. I'd pull across trucks carrying chickens to slaughter. I'd go to the airfields when they were flying veal to Europe.\" He told people that if they didn't respect the rights of animals, it was as bad as not respecting the rights of women, children and black people. He still believes that, and condemns the Christian church for compartmentalising compassion. \"It says you can exploit the animals on the one hand and be a Christian, be compassionate, on the other. You can't do that, though. It's what the Nazis were doing to the Jews and the gypsies and the homosexuals. They were slaughtering them in the morning and going home in the afternoon and pretending to be loving parents. And that's just not possible. Compassion is all consuming.\" He often compares the killing of animals to the Holocaust. When he talks about vegetarianism he lectures and harangues. He believes it is his duty to do so. Most people presumed Newman was a hard-line leftwinger. But he has always claimed he wasn't interested in left and right. He doesn't even vote. \"If I were to think that Tony Blair or William Hague or whoever runs the Liber als were the solution then I'd be totally lost. The political structure just does not deliver. All politicians are self-seeking.\" But a ballot ignored can deliver genocide. Would he have voted against Hitler? He says he's not sure, turns back to the \"animal genocide\" that surrounds us, and repeats that it is crass to prioritise one form of genocide over another. Somehow it takes a while to notice Newman's left hand. Perhaps because it spends a good deal of time in his pocket. Part of the palm and two and a half fingers are missing. \"I just used to make bombs,\" he says casually. \"I was about 11 I think... it was quite shocking. I was making them in the garden shed.\" This must have been another defining moment in his childhood. Certainly an event that turned him away from violence. Why was he making bombs? \"I wish I had an answer to that. I expect I was curious and destructive.\" The fingers were in pieces, splattered on the shed walls. He didn't cry because he couldn't feel anything. The shock numbed him. Ruth Caleb, his executive producer, says what attracted her to him was his integrity, the moral principle that underlines everything he does. But it has also very nearly been his undoing after he started to produce his own work so he could dictate the catering. In 1996 there was mutiny on the set of Black and Blue, another exploration of police corruption. \"The nemesis came a week and a half into the shoot when the troops had had enough of the vegetarian food. They wanted a choice.\" Newman remembers getting a call from Caleb pleading with him to compromise. \"She said: 'You've got to have meat', and I said: 'Well, fuck, I don't do the show'.\" Newman rarely swears. \"I was prepared to walk out.\" After all, he says, if he was having people round to his house, he would not serve meat or fish. As producer, he was buying the food, in effect playing host, so why should he betray his vegetarianism? The tabloids had a riot. The Sun compared him to Goebbels. In the end Newman steamed up to Liverpool to argue his case. \"He spoke to everyone, said you've all agreed to the food, reinvigorated them, and we carried on with the vegetarian shoot,\" Caleb says. \"In another life I think Gordon would have been a prophet or a disciple. No, he would have definitely been a prophet.\" Ken Trodd, who produced For The Greater Good, says Newman has become more and more controlling over the years. \"I love Gordon, but it's so hard not to sound comic when talking about him.\" He recalls the time when Newman received his Bafta's writer award. \"Gordon called me, and said I take it there will be at least one vegan table. I said I'm sure that'll be fine. Next thing I get a call from him asking whether the whole event couldn't be vegan. I suppose there's a hubristic sense of always asking for one more thing, however outrageous it may seem - not that it seems outrageous to Gordon. There is a sense of his wanting to control the world he has access to.\" After the Bafta food, came the speech. The event was live, and Bafta organisers were worried that Newman would may go on for ever. They asked Trodd to have a quiet word in his ear. \"So I told Gordon there was some concern about how long he was going to speak. He told me not to worry because he'd been working on it and he'd managed to get it down to 13 minutes.\" He says that's typical Newman. Is working with Newman really such a nightmare? Ruth Caleb says: \"I look at it the other way round. You have a talented writer, a bit of a legend, who is also an individual as a producer. God knows there are few enough individuals around, and I think the crew are fortunate to be able to work with a writer who cares so passionately about things. And if they really wanted bacon butties they could have brought their own.\" \"As long as they didn't eat them near me,\" Newman says. He admits there were times when he became overly aggressive. Not only did he refuse to share a table with meat-eaters but he became much more evangelical about his spiritual beliefs. This apparently gentle, compassionate man started to say things that sounded anything but compassionate. He believes that in this life, as in every life, we are paying off a debt. In short, and at its most simplistic, victims of crime, prejudice, ill health, even - by implication - police brutality, must have done something in a previous existence to deserve it.

He ended the festivities with a cheering rendition of a new song, We Hurtle Towards the Grave, but the highlight, to a salsa backing track, was his tribute to the Hotpot Queen. \"We see Betty Turpin only when she's working,\" he began, all strained and warbly with emotion. \"It's not right.\" </p> <p>Driving an 84-year-old great aunt and a six-year-old niece to lunch on Christmas Day, I tuned in to find Chris Tarrant pretending one of his team (male) had given him a naked photograph of himself as a gift. \"You'll [guffaw] never [hee-hee] win the pole vault [splutter].\" Great Aunt Maude looked puzzled, the tiny tot even more so, and then they both looked at me.

It takes the premise of Sleepless in Seattle - a single parent's offspring should choose them a date - and turns it into a bit of a gentle game show. Three women were pitted against each other for the affection of Peter, a musician. In choosing from them a suitable date for their father, Hannah, Joe and Andrew asked the women involved questions (\"Do you know any jokes?\"), had a nosy round their houses (\"She's very tidy\"), and went off for an outing with them. Presented by the sweet but sharp Mel Giedroyc, this was Blind Date with added social awareness (and less of a budget for the final date, which took place in a curry house in south London). </p> <p>Caroline, 37, was a human resources manager whose ideal man was Tony Hadley. Either she gargled gravel in her spare time or smoked 80 Marlboro Red a day. She also mixed dark colours with light ones in her washing, much to Mel's horror. After smelling her perfume (\"very strong\"), Mel concluded Caroline might be a bit bossy. Martine, 43, was a nurse whose kitchen cupboards were lined with paper and neatly arranged. She kept her clothes colour-coordinated in her wardrobe and took the children to a climbing wall. This perhaps wasn't a good choice of outing since Andrew was only six and didn't want to climb very high (Martine might have been hoping to branch into paediatrics when he tumbled to a broken leg, thus impressing Peter). Mel thought Martine was nice but slightly anally retentive. </p> <p>Kirstin was German and an IT manager. She had met most of her recent dates on the internet, while her ideal man was Kevin Costner. Amazingly, with all these factors working against her, the children liked her the most and chose her for their dad. They even enjoyed going to a ceramics painting session with her. \"Judging by them,\" Kirstin said of the children, \"their father must be lovely.\" Mel thought Kirstin had a nice house (though her carpeted bed seemed unhygienic to me). Peter and Kirstin's date went well, despite the presence of a camera, but Mel didn't seem too genuine in her delight. I think she was harbouring a secret desire for Peter herself. </p> <p>Like Vanessa Feltz, polar bears are dangerous, especially when hungry. Unfortunately, none made a lunge at either of the Vets in the Wild (BBC1). In Churchill, Canada, the polar bear capital of the world, Trude and Steve were helping locals to keep hungry bears away from juicy tourists as well as giving them routine health checks (the bears, not the tourists). This meant wandering around snowy scenes with tranquiliser guns and endearing woolly hats. </p> <p>Hats seem to be a theme of Vets in Practice (BBC1). In the Christmas special - in between cats having their diaphragms sewn back together and a lumpy horse - Emma the vet bought herself a hat for \"a treat\" since Joe, her partner, had slipped off to France to go snowboarding. A hat? How about a night of passionate love with a complete stranger during which he laps champagne off her naked body? A hat indeed. Some people haven't a clue how to have fun. </p> <p>In One Man and His Dog (BBC2), they never go to mow. Even in what was a national competition, there was no grand synchronised grass-cutting. That was a shame since such a sight would be quite arresting and everyone could sing along as all the men went to mow, went to mow a meadow. As it was, we got Clarissa Dickson-Wright in her wellies (not concrete, malheureusement, and not on a river bed) marvelling at the joys of the countryside. At least it keeps her out of the kitchen, one supposes. </p> <p>Perhaps in an attempt to persuade da kids that Channel 4 is even more funky and cool than they had previously imagined - in advance of the launch of their new entertainment channel, E4, and not in a cynical way at all - two hours of Spice Girls coverage started with a fairly bog-standard documentary culled from MTV, Biorhythm: The Spice Girls (Channel 4), before Robbie Williams's Videodrome (Channel 4) gave the bloke from Stoke an hour of free advertising for his albums.

Frost etched the valley crags and a kestrel circled the high spaces.

      "body": "<p>If any man could claim to be the father of modern Scottish skiing and ski-racing it was Karl Fuchs. Even now, as the Cairngorm ski area he did so much to further is building a new \u00a314m funicular railway serving up to 20 runs, many who ski there will recall the start they were given from the Struan House Hotel at nearby Carrbridge. The first ski hotel in Scotland, it was set up by this extraordinary man - Austrian dissident, Iron Cross-holder, Olympic-class skier, and pioneer, with his English wife Eileen, of much that is best in Scottish skiing. </p> <p>Not that there was anything \"best\" when Fuchs arrived in 1954. British Alpine climbers of the Victorian era used skis only as an adjunct to climbing - they may have learned their skills on Britain's many challenging rock faces, but not on its ski slopes, because these simply did not exist. </p> <p>Conditions in the Scottish Highlands were very different from those in the continental European ski resorts. A contemporary noted: \"Snow slopes in Scotland take on a most puzzling kind of surface glare which defies the most hawk-eyed of skiers and reduces the short-sighted runner, with moisture on his glasses to a state of dithering funk... with uncertain snow, heather, rocks, windswept ice and all kinds of bunkers placed in the most awkward and trying positions, fast running is mere folly.\" </p> <p>But there was a Scottish Ski Club, made up of \"skiers afraid of nothing\", according to one continental visitor, \"just as long as there is a little snow buried beneath the grass.\" But when the second world war intervened, winter training took on a darker purpose. Lord Hunt of Everest fame recalled the fierce blizzards suddenly whipping in from the Arctic. \"On one occasion, fighting the way up to Loch Etchachan in the teeth of a gale, I watched [Frank] Smythe lifted by some gust and deposited 40ft below the track in a snow drift.\" </p> <p>After the war, people began to think again about Scotland's possibilities, but until Karl and Eileen Fuchs arrived there was no exact commercial focus, no person of sufficient charisma and credibility to make things happen on a scale that could ensure Aviemore and the Cairngorms became the first Scottish ski destination centre. </p> <p>It was in late 1954 that Fuchs pulled up the blinds of the overnight train from Euston and, for the first time, observed the Cairngorm mountains capped by winter snow. So much snow and only early November! There would not always be this much snow, but he wasn't to learn this until later. Fuchs was born in 1924 in Steiermark, Austria. His father was a steelworker, a man of the Schutzbund, or left, bitterly at odds with the nationalistic Heimwehr. After one particularly bloody street battle, the 10-year-old Karl was left desperately seeking his father among the dead and injured. It proved to be a memory that would stay with him his whole life - though his father did escape abroad, only to be imprisoned on his return until the end of the second world war. </p> <p>But there was no escaping the wartime call-up for Fuchs. He avoided fighting in Stalingrad and spent time in Yugoslavia. The Iron Cross came with his part in the demolition of a bridge, but after this, he and a few companions discarded their uniforms, lived off the land and made it back home in 1945. </p> <p>Eileen Knowles, the daughter of Maurice, a first-world-war RAF pilot, met Fuchs on an Austrian ski slope after the war. An honours history graduate from Newnham College, Cambridge, she had performed wartime civil service functions. </p> <p>Studying German in Vienna was not the most obvious post-war relief for Eileen, but her father was also learning the language in Austria while becoming one of the earliest guides to Major Walter Ingham, the Alpine tour operator. </p> <p>Karl's fluency of manner and ski style won over Eileen. She could speak German to him. He, initially, understood only one word in 10 of English. For the remainder of his days, Fuchs would speak what became known throughout the skier Highlands as \"Scotstrian\". So, \"I kop sex bindle stick\" meant he had carried six bundles of slalom poles up the mountain. </p> <p>By 1947 Fuchs had achieved minor fame as Austria's police ski champion and as a member of his country's training squad for the 1948 St Moritz Winter Olympics. Suddenly, with a crash on a Zugspitze training course, his ambitions were in ruins. His leg was so badly fractured he spent most of the next nine months in hospital. Skiing, though, was in his blood and when Eileen met him he had become one of the first to qualify from a new, nationally approved instructors' course. </p> <p>The pair quickly set their minds on a ski hotel, but motorcycle expeditions into the mountains from their apartment in Bruck found no suitable place at a price they could afford. Finally their thoughts turned to Britain. With Maurice as guide, and camping in two small tents, they found Snowdonia compelling, but with snow too uncertain for Britain's first ski school. Disappointed, they drove north to the Lake District to hear the same story. </p> <p>The Scottish Council for Physical Recreation suggested three areas - Glencoe, Ben Lawers and the north-facing Cairngorms, close to the village of Aviemore. The last proved to be first. In the late summer sunshine, all were enchanted by the beauty of Loch Morlich. Fuchs took out his binoculars and saw a steep, narrow corridor running to the left of the 4,084ft Cairngorm peak. A filling of snow and what a brilliant intermediate run it would make. The search was over. </p> <p>Or nearly. The Euston-Inverness railway ran beside the River Spey and the narrow B9152, which led from the A9 to the village of Aviemore - one big hotel and a few houses - and the even smaller village of Carrbridge. There they hit upon the Struan House Hotel, once a substantial double-fronted house with small, tower-like features, and, pricelessly, an annexe. And it was for sale, at \u00a35,000. It was like their own first encounter, love at first sight. In November, 1954, they bought it. Scotland's first ski hotel was born, and with it the Austrian Ski School. </p> <p>They were little aware of what they were getting into.\"Horizontal\" weather, wind-whipped Arctic sleet, can pierce a conventional ski anorak like grapeshot. Equally, the mist will lift or winds ease, and a day's sublime skiing follow. </p> <p>The Fuchs' fortunes were not dissimilar. Karl was always in the forefront of the fight for key amenities, but there were many schisms, battles and setbacks. Yet the visitors kept coming. </p> <p>In the 60s and 70s the Cairngorm upgrades proceeded slowly, its public still mostly from Scotland. London and the south-east were sniffy, and closer, in any case, to the Alps, but Manchester and the Midlands were catching on. </p> <p>In 1960, the all-important road to the ski area was opened; in 1961, the chairlift and the Sheiling and Ptarmigan lodges. The White Lady tow gave access to a fine slalom slope. Then, not of Fuch's making, but a bonus for its publicity - the Coylumbridge Hotel skating rink. A T-bar to Coire Cas followed, opening up more ski territory. Next, the Aviemore Centre - hotels, ski shops, pin tables and go-carts. Then an internationally recognised slalom race course and, in 1967, the British championships. </p> <p>On a sunny Saturday, more especially in late-season, when Scottish snow is often at its best, there were suddenly 6,000 skiers on Cairngorm: sleek and adept as contemporaries in Verbier or Val d'Is\u00e9re. Today there are up to 20 runs to choose from, and Aonoch Mor beneath Ben Nevis, near Fort William has come to join the Cairngorms as a serious destination, along with the less built-up areas of Glencoe, Glenshee and the Lecht. </p> <p>Not least of Fuch's achievements in a heavily Presbyterian environment was the installation of his bar. Beyond the bar counter Struan encouraged people to do adventurous things. On hundreds of occasions when there was no hope of skiing because of the weather, Fuchs would conduct a birdwatching ramble round, say, Loch an Eilein. </p> <p>One instructor, Dieter Bartsch, became head of the Austrian ski team, then the Swiss women, then the Norwegian men and recently the Swiss men. The world of skiing was amazed that from these Scottish roots he could help propel Konrad Bartelski and Fuchs's own son, Peter, into the top 20 of the 1974 World Championships at St Moritz. </p> <p>But in 1980, Peter died, tragically young at 24, in a car accident. </p> <p>The Fuchs worked on for four years, but the sparkle had gone from Struan. The frostbitten foot of Fuchs's war years deteriorated and in 1984 the hotel was sold. Three years later, Maurice died at the age of 94. There was one more emotional visit to Austria, in 1990, then for the Fuchs it was back to the croft they had made their home, next door to which their daughter, Lisi, and son-in-law, Davie, built a restaurant. On September 30 1990, Karl Fuchs died in his sleep, loyal to his adopted Cairngorms to the last. Eileen survives him, helping to administer the Karl and Peter Fuchs Memorial Fund for the benefit of young Speyside skiers, proud of the memorial plaque to Karl that now sits prominently on Cairngorm, weathering all the storms. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Brown's Struan, the Extraordinary Story of Karl and Eileen Fuchs, is available from Right Words, 14 Bedford Road, St Albans, Herts AL1 3BQ, at \u00a39.95.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The American election of 1876 was a close race. After 16 weeks of dispute over voting returns, the contested votes were awarded to Republican Rutherford B Hayes, only three days before the scheduled inauguration. His opponent, Democrat Samuel J Tilden, had won the popular vote. </p> <p>Throughout the controversy, one man remained unconcerned. Joshua Norton knew who was really running the country. </p> <p>Four years later on January 10 1880, a funeral cortege two miles long made its way through the streets of San Francisco. Estimates put the size of the crowd lining the route at between 10-30,000. Flags all over the city hung at half-mast. Businesses were closed out of respect. Many citizens had wept openly the previous day, when the San Francisco Chronicle had run the banner headline: 'Le roi est mort'. The silver plate on the rosewood coffin to which all eyes were turned read: \"Joshua A Norton. Died January 8, 1880. Aged about 65.\" </p> <p>Although Joshua Abraham Norton was given a funeral worthy of a king - the most elaborate the city had ever seen - his estate was worth less than $6. A stranger could never have guessed that the eccentrically dressed tramp who had collapsed and died on a rainy pavement was in fact Norton I, Emperor of the United States of America. </p> <p>The man who ruled America for more than 20 years had been born in London on Valentine's Day, 1819, the son of an entrepreneur. The family moved to South Africa where John Norton prospered in shipping, leaving on his death a small fortune to his son. Joshua arrived in the city of San Francisco on the November 23 1849, carrying his $40,000 legacy in a trunk and opened a general store. He imported commodities such as coal, bricks, coffee, tea, flour and beef, held them until they were in great demand, then sold at a huge profit. As a result of his speculating and shrewd real-estate deals, Norton had accumulated a fortune of a quarter of a million dollars by 1853. </p> <p>Flushed by success, he next endeavoured to corner the market in rice. Anticipating a shortage, he used his entire fortune to buy all the rice he could lay his hands on. The shortage never materialised - instead, the market was glutted. In 1857 Norton was declared bankrupt. Stunned and disorientated, he left his elegant town house for a shabby room in a seedy boarding house and, ironically, a job in a rice factory. </p> <p>For the next two years little is known of Norton's movements. But while he wrapped himself in a cocoon of obscurity, an inner metamorphosis was taking place. When he finally emerged, the transformation was complete. </p> <p>On the evening of September 16 1859, Norton called on the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin and gave him a document in which his intentions were clearly laid out. So extraordinary and impressive was his bearing that the editor not only accepted it, but printed it on the front page. Next day the people of San Francisco read it over breakfast. </p> <p>\"At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton... declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these United States; and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different states of the Union to assemble... to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, both in our stability and in our integrity.\" </p> <p>The statement was signed Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico. </p> <p>While the people of San Francisco were still absorbing this news, Norton issued a second edict, also published by the Bulletin, which enlarged on his motives: \"It is represented to us that the universal suffrage, as now existing through the Union, is abused; that fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice, that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects . . .\" </p> <p>He went on to abolish Congress and, incensed when nobody took any notice, dissolved the Republic. Eventually he entirely lost his patience with Washington's disobedience, and went the whole hog, abolishing the office of president, and announcing that, henceforth, he would rule personally. (He was later to cast off his title of Protector of Mexico in response to the disconcerting news of the execution of his fellow emperor, Maximillian, by rebels.) </p> <p>While all this legislation occupied much of Norton's time, there are many testaments to the serious dedication which characterised his approach to his new station in life. He immersed himself in the lives and preoccupations of his subjects, his diverse business involving the critical study of bus timetables, the inspection of sewers, drains and construction sites and the discussion of the crime rate with local police. </p> <p>His determination to rule even-handedly caused him to attend a different religious service each week in order to avoid giving rise to sectarian jealousy. Born a Jew, Norton subsequently ordered the amalgamation of all faiths into one \"Universal Religion\". This was around the time of, and philosophically consistent with, his abolition of the Republican and Democrat parties. He disdained the trappings of majesty and walked, cycled or used public transport, showing himself daily in the streets in order to remain accessible and in touch with his subjects. </p> <p>This stocky, bearded man, whose occupation was listed both in the census and in the city directory as \"Emperor\", cut a dignified if somewhat eccentric figure, striding about the city streets in a pale blue army officer's uniform with gold-plated epaulettes and brass buttons, topped by a tall black beaver hat with a bright green plume and a rosette. A pair of outsize boots was slit at the sides to accommodate his corns. A heavy sabre, donated by a local blacksmith, clanked at his heels, and he was never without both a walking-stick and a garish Chinese umbrella. The Emperor's regal air was further enhanced by a fresh rose in his buttonhole, if not by his constant retinue of his two famously well-behaved mongrel dogs, Lazarus and Bummer. </p> <p>What was more astounding than the Emperor's appearance and behaviour, however, was the affection and deference shown to him by the citizens of San Francisco. People he met in the street bowed and curtsied. He was invited to arbitrate in local disputes, and faith in his judgment led to his frequently being com pared with Solomon. He invariably ate out, often at fashionable restaurants, and was rarely embarrassed by the presentation of a bill. Establishments he had patronised were entitled to post a sign: \"By Appointment to His Imperial Majesty, Joshua Norton I\", an endorsement guaranteed to attract customers. He rode free of charge on public transport and had complimentary seats for the theatre, where, upon his entrance, the audience always respectfully rose to its feet. Throughout his reign newspapers published all his royal decrees free of charge. </p> <p>Despite his exalted status, the Emperor continued to rule America from his humble quarters in the lodging house. One commentator writes: \"The Emperor held court in a shabby, rented room furnished with a camp bed, a table and chair, a faded rug and a broken washstand. His regalia hung on nails knocked into the walls, and pictures of Queen Victoria and the Empress Eugenie covered damp patches on the wallpaper.\" Norton had taken steps to procure more appropriate accommodation, as an edict of September 1870 shows: \"Whereas our friends and adherents are dissatisfied that we are not better lodged, and hold that we ought to have had a suitable palace years ago; </p> <p>\"Whereas the treasonable proscriptive acts of some of the hotel keepers of this city have kept us out of decent rooms for our accommodations... </p> <p>\"Now, therefore, we do hereby command the proprietors of the Grand Hotel to forthwith furnish us with rooms, under penalty of being banished.\" </p> <p>The Grand Hotel evidently complied, but soon found housing an emperor too exacting, forcing him to announce: </p> <p>\"Whereas the Grand Hotel, hitherto our headquarters, is in rebellion; now, therefore, we, Norton I, so hereby command the water companies to close down on them, and the gas company to give them no light, so as to bring them to terms.\" </p> <p>He returned to the boarding house, and while friends continued to pay his rent and his travel and dining expenses were taken care of, there remained the problem of the imperial wardrobe. The day came when his eclectic ensemble became unacceptably tatty, whereupon another of his edicts appeared: \"We, Norton I, have heard serious complaints that our wardrobe is a national disgrace...\" The city's board of supervisors took the hint, and, with much ceremony, appropriated money for a new one, while the city's tailors vied for the honour of creating a replacement ensemble. Emperor Norton showed his appreciation by elevating all the city supervisors to noble rank. </p> <p>\"The Emp\", as he was called by his intimates, dealt with the remaining expenses of daily life by issuing his own currency, or Bonds of Empire, designed and printed by himself and illustrated with his own portrait. The bonds promised to repay the bearer the full amount, plus 25% in 20 years' time and were accepted all over the city. </p> <p>Despite the fact that Norton I was so well-known that visitors to San Francisco took home statuettes and postcards depicting his image, and he was generally paid his due respect, he would from time to time encounter subjects unaware of his identity and status. On one such occasion an ignorant employee of the Central Pacific Railroad refused him a free meal aboard one of its trains; the Emperor had no option but to abolish the company. Similarly, when a river boat captain ordered Norton off his boat for not paying his fare he retaliated by ordering the US navy to blockade all the company's vessels. In the face of this threat, the board of directors immediately apologised and presented the emperor with a lifetime free pass. </p> <p>In 1867, an over-zealous policeman was sufficiently foolish to arrest him with the aim of subjecting him to \"involuntary treatment for a mental disorder\". Public opinion was so outraged that, fearing a riot, police chief Patrick Crowley went in person to release him from custody, and issued a full public apology. The Emperor accepted this with characteristic graciousness and urbanity, but newspapers angrily denounced the offence against his \"imperial majesty\", approvingly quoting a judge's opinion that: \"He has shed no blood, robbed nobody, deprived nobody of his country, which is more than can be said for most fellows in the king line.\" The city of San Francisco endeavoured to make matters up to the Emperor by granting him free board and lodging for life. </p> <p>Norton was a great correspondent, writing regularly to other heads of state with messages of sympathy or advice. He bombarded Bismarck with ingenious strategies during the Franco-Prussian war and, at the outbreak of the civil war in 1861, sent letters to President Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, summoning them to San Francisco so that he could mediate. Undaunted by the absence of responses he threw in his lot with Lincoln, pledging his political and military allegiance. Lincoln wrote back politely declining to take up this generous offer. </p> <p>Like many public figures, Norton was subject to interference in his life by complete strangers. False proclamations were sometimes concocted by journalists in order to boost newspaper sales, and bogus telegrams were a favourite ploy. One wag attempted to arrange a marriage for Norton with the widowed Queen Victoria. Telegrams of congratulations on the proposed match purported to come from Tsar Alexander, Disraeli and Ulysses S Grant. </p> <p>San Francisco citizens' desire to promote the city as a friendly metropolis which tolerates - indeed celebrates - all kinds of eccentricity has been suspected of enlarging and enhancing the myth of Emperor Norton. Some have reasonably cast doubt on the extent to which Norton's lifestyle was good-naturedly subsidised by the people of the city, while others have suspected the notion of the general compliance of banks and others with Norton's currency. (We do know for certain that the First National Bank refused to honour one of Norton's cheques for $100 in 1869, because he responded by ordering the confiscation of the bank's assets.) </p> <p>We may smile at the widely cited \"fact\" that three seats were always reserved for the Emperor at the opening night of any theatrical entertainment in the city (the other two were for Lazarus and Bummer), and also at the claim that thousands of people showed up at his dog's funeral because the Emperor was so upset. If this seems fanciful, it is certainly the case that when Bummer died in 1865, the royal pooch was sufficiently famous for journalist Samuel Clemens to publish his epitaph. </p> <p>Was Joshua Norton mad? Those who knew him personally stated categorically that apart from his insistence that he was an emperor, he was \"perfectly reasonable and highly intellectual. He was regarded without sarcasm as an honest, noble, intelligent man. People respected him because he respected them\". It seems likely that, as some claim, he suffered a nervous breakdown following his bankruptcy, and that this experience opened the door somehow to what followed. The self-made man had gone down the pan, and Norton re-invented himself, this time as a self-made emperor - in that now well-worn phrase - \"in people's hearts\". </p> <p>And if he was crazy, just how crazy was he? He anticipated a civil war in America as early as July 1860 and also called for funding for research into the potential of \"aerial machines\" - both barmy ideas at the time. As far as his ideas for global peace went, he was sufficiently unhinged to call upon other world leaders to join him in creating a \"League of Nations\" where international disputes could be resolved peacefully. Locally, he had the distinctly unusual idea of filling in parts of San Francisco Bay in order to create more space for development. But more preposterous than any of his other notions was his proposal for \"a suspension bridge to be built from Oakland Point to Goat Island, and thence to Telegraph Hill.\" This was at a time when the only suspension bridges in existence were in remote parts of Africa. </p> <p>Half a century later the Bay Bridge (or Golden Gate) was constructed exactly as Norton had suggested and it still bears a plaque commemorating his \"prophetic wisdom\". His memory also lives on where he now lies, at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Colma. His red granite tombstone reads: Norton I, Emperor of the United States, Protector of Mexico, Joshua A Norton, 1819-1880. There are no quotation marks. </p> <p>\u0095 Sarah Burton's book Impostors: Six Kinds of Liar, published in hardback by Viking (\u00a315.99) will be published by Penguin (\u00a37.99) in March.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The American election of 1876 was a close race. After 16 weeks of dispute over voting returns, the contested votes were awarded to Republican Rutherford B Hayes, only three days before the scheduled inauguration. His opponent, Democrat Samuel J Tilden, had won the popular vote. Throughout the controversy, one man remained unconcerned. Joshua Norton knew who was really running the country. Four years later on January 10 1880, a funeral cortege two miles long made its way through the streets of San Francisco. Estimates put the size of the crowd lining the route at between 10-30,000. Flags all over the city hung at half-mast. Businesses were closed out of respect. Many citizens had wept openly the previous day, when the San Francisco Chronicle had run the banner headline: 'Le roi est mort'. The silver plate on the rosewood coffin to which all eyes were turned read: \"Joshua A Norton. Died January 8, 1880. Aged about 65.\" Although Joshua Abraham Norton was given a funeral worthy of a king - the most elaborate the city had ever seen - his estate was worth less than $6. A stranger could never have guessed that the eccentrically dressed tramp who had collapsed and died on a rainy pavement was in fact Norton I, Emperor of the United States of America. The man who ruled America for more than 20 years had been born in London on Valentine's Day, 1819, the son of an entrepreneur. The family moved to South Africa where John Norton prospered in shipping, leaving on his death a small fortune to his son. Joshua arrived in the city of San Francisco on the November 23 1849, carrying his $40,000 legacy in a trunk and opened a general store. He imported commodities such as coal, bricks, coffee, tea, flour and beef, held them until they were in great demand, then sold at a huge profit. As a result of his speculating and shrewd real-estate deals, Norton had accumulated a fortune of a quarter of a million dollars by 1853. Flushed by success, he next endeavoured to corner the market in rice. Anticipating a shortage, he used his entire fortune to buy all the rice he could lay his hands on. The shortage never materialised - instead, the market was glutted. In 1857 Norton was declared bankrupt. Stunned and disorientated, he left his elegant town house for a shabby room in a seedy boarding house and, ironically, a job in a rice factory. For the next two years little is known of Norton's movements. But while he wrapped himself in a cocoon of obscurity, an inner metamorphosis was taking place. When he finally emerged, the transformation was complete. On the evening of September 16 1859, Norton called on the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin and gave him a document in which his intentions were clearly laid out. So extraordinary and impressive was his bearing that the editor not only accepted it, but printed it on the front page. Next day the people of San Francisco read it over breakfast. \"At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton... declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these United States; and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different states of the Union to assemble... to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, both in our stability and in our integrity.\" The statement was signed Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico.

      "body": "<p>Resolution. Even the word I don't like. It sounds like revolution, then sneaks away with a weasly ssss. And, of course, it's the opposite of revolution - it won't change anything. Sure, it'll make you feel like the hero of your own story, but isn't that a bit of a sad desire to start with? </p> <p>Attach the word to New Year's, of course, and you've got a recipe for true cretinism. Is there still anyone over the age of 12 who makes New Year's resolutions? If I've learned anything from 41 years of being on this planet, it's that uttering the words \"I'm never going to (insert pet vice here) again\" make you look about as worldly as Tom Kitten. Yes, you will, and yes, your words will come back to haunt you, making your defeat all the more poignant. Then you'll end up saying, \"Well, I'm strong enough now to give into temptation just the once\", and before you know it you're doing tricks for bottle tops in Cardboard City. </p> <p>I am of the opinion that interfering in people's self-destructiveness, or even in their mild hell- raising, actually makes the situation far worse. The three great addiction stories of the year were those of Robbie Williams, Daniella Westbrook and Will Self, and the various fates of these famous addicts carried an interesting lesson. Self has taken many cures for heroin addiction, administered both by himself and by alleged professionals. But despite a lot of hypocritical cant from Mr Dictionary-Swallower over the years, he had never been truly drug-free for more than five minutes in the past 30 years or so until earlier this year: suddenly, while wrapping a huge slab of dope in a perfume-drenched cloth in order to take it to America to get him through a reading tour, he suddenly got this overview of himself and looked down at this fortysomething father of three indulging in this terminally undignified activity. That was what got him clean, he swears; not the expensive therapy or the self-loathing, but the sheer inappropriateness of it all. </p> <p>The simple difference between Self, who did give up, and Williams and Westbrook, both of whom fall off the wagon more often than cheap sound systems, is that Self was almost twice their age and had therefore done loads more drugs. </p> <p>There comes a day when intoxication, like anything else, becomes boring, and a clean-up undertaken under these circumstances would seem to stand a whole lot more chance of sticking than one that is tried because society doesn't approve or you might get the sack from a soap opera. Vitally, Westbrook and Williams are young and beautiful - she still looks better with just the one nostril than most of us do with two - and there is nothing like being young and beautiful to make you feel immortal. </p> <p>Over Christmas and the New Year, all of our shabby double standards about intoxication come into play. As we reel from party to party, well-fed and employed, we are meant to heed the words of the Homeless Tsar - and in this case how appropriate that title is, tsars being a byword for treating oppressed people very badly in a cold climate - and not give as much as a spare 50p piece to the poor youngster on the blanket outside the bank in case he or she spends it all on drink! But if being homeless at Christmas or the New Year doesn't deserve a drink, what does? Wouldn't it be funny, though totally understandable, if those who live on the streets looked at us and pitied us for our inability to be happy without getting smashed, despite all the comforts we have? </p> <p>While reminding us that every junkie started out on a puff of marijuana and therefore we can't be trusted to try it without being punished by law (and at the same time condemning the nanny state), the curtain-twitching Tory press will contrive both to egg us on and rein us in where drink is concerned, this year as all others. </p> <p>Do these hacks actually get paid for reminding us to drink one glass of water for every glass of alcohol? Does everyone not know by now that this is wise? And does anyone actually do it? But if you think about it, the Alternate Glass Of Water theory is to the liver what the Marquess of Queensbury rules are to fighting; that is, they don't actually protect the body in the long run, but just enable it to take punishment for longer without switching off, as it would if left to itself while being drowned in alcohol or hit around the head. </p> <p>In both cases, something that is obviously very bad for people is encouraged by \"sensible\" precautions, which simply add up to more profits for drinks manufacturers and boxing promoters alike. </p> <p> Having said that, I certainly plan to spend another happy New Year insensible with drink, because that's the kind of crazy guy I am. But I do so in the knowledge that I am as much a drug abuser as the sweet-faced junkie in the street, and, like him - but unlike your self-deluding \"sensible\" drinker - I won't be boring friends with tales of my hangovers or swearing never to do it again. Once you're hooked, you're hooked, and then all that matters is carrying off your addiction with a certain self-aware dignity until such time as it becomes that worst of all things, a bore, to you.

      "bodyText": "Resolution. Even the word I don't like. It sounds like revolution, then sneaks away with a weasly ssss. And, of course, it's the opposite of revolution - it won't change anything. Sure, it'll make you feel like the hero of your own story, but isn't that a bit of a sad desire to start with? Attach the word to New Year's, of course, and you've got a recipe for true cretinism. Is there still anyone over the age of 12 who makes New Year's resolutions? If I've learned anything from 41 years of being on this planet, it's that uttering the words \"I'm never going to (insert pet vice here) again\" make you look about as worldly as Tom Kitten. Yes, you will, and yes, your words will come back to haunt you, making your defeat all the more poignant. Then you'll end up saying, \"Well, I'm strong enough now to give into temptation just the once\", and before you know it you're doing tricks for bottle tops in Cardboard City. I am of the opinion that interfering in people's self-destructiveness, or even in their mild hell- raising, actually makes the situation far worse. The three great addiction stories of the year were those of Robbie Williams, Daniella Westbrook and Will Self, and the various fates of these famous addicts carried an interesting lesson. Self has taken many cures for heroin addiction, administered both by himself and by alleged professionals. But despite a lot of hypocritical cant from Mr Dictionary-Swallower over the years, he had never been truly drug-free for more than five minutes in the past 30 years or so until earlier this year: suddenly, while wrapping a huge slab of dope in a perfume-drenched cloth in order to take it to America to get him through a reading tour, he suddenly got this overview of himself and looked down at this fortysomething father of three indulging in this terminally undignified activity. That was what got him clean, he swears; not the expensive therapy or the self-loathing, but the sheer inappropriateness of it all. The simple difference between Self, who did give up, and Williams and Westbrook, both of whom fall off the wagon more often than cheap sound systems, is that Self was almost twice their age and had therefore done loads more drugs. There comes a day when intoxication, like anything else, becomes boring, and a clean-up undertaken under these circumstances would seem to stand a whole lot more chance of sticking than one that is tried because society doesn't approve or you might get the sack from a soap opera. Vitally, Westbrook and Williams are young and beautiful - she still looks better with just the one nostril than most of us do with two - and there is nothing like being young and beautiful to make you feel immortal. Over Christmas and the New Year, all of our shabby double standards about intoxication come into play. As we reel from party to party, well-fed and employed, we are meant to heed the words of the Homeless Tsar - and in this case how appropriate that title is, tsars being a byword for treating oppressed people very badly in a cold climate - and not give as much as a spare 50p piece to the poor youngster on the blanket outside the bank in case he or she spends it all on drink! But if being homeless at Christmas or the New Year doesn't deserve a drink, what does? Wouldn't it be funny, though totally understandable, if those who live on the streets looked at us and pitied us for our inability to be happy without getting smashed, despite all the comforts we have? While reminding us that every junkie started out on a puff of marijuana and therefore we can't be trusted to try it without being punished by law (and at the same time condemning the nanny state), the curtain-twitching Tory press will contrive both to egg us on and rein us in where drink is concerned, this year as all others. Do these hacks actually get paid for reminding us to drink one glass of water for every glass of alcohol? Does everyone not know by now that this is wise? And does anyone actually do it? But if you think about it, the Alternate Glass Of Water theory is to the liver what the Marquess of Queensbury rules are to fighting; that is, they don't actually protect the body in the long run, but just enable it to take punishment for longer without switching off, as it would if left to itself while being drowned in alcohol or hit around the head. In both cases, something that is obviously very bad for people is encouraged by \"sensible\" precautions, which simply add up to more profits for drinks manufacturers and boxing promoters alike. Having said that, I certainly plan to spend another happy New Year insensible with drink, because that's the kind of crazy guy I am. But I do so in the knowledge that I am as much a drug abuser as the sweet-faced junkie in the street, and, like him - but unlike your self-deluding \"sensible\" drinker - I won't be boring friends with tales of my hangovers or swearing never to do it again. Once you're hooked, you're hooked, and then all that matters is carrying off your addiction with a certain self-aware dignity until such time as it becomes that worst of all things, a bore, to you. Then, and only then, can you really think seriously about getting and staying clean. If old Alanis Morissette was here, I bet she'd say that this next thing was ironic, but nevertheless: it is sad and strange that even though we may behave bestially when intoxicated, what separates us from our animal friends is the knowledge that we are all going to die. And if that isn't the scariest, creepiest thing you've ever heard, then you're a cooler customer than me, Gunga Din.

So, next time you see some disgusting drunk - be he suited and booted and reeling home from the City, or sitting on the pavement with piles and a pet rat called Satan - just think: maybe the reason he's like that is because he's simply more sensitive than sensible, social-drinking, Chardonnay-sipping you. Maybe you're the brute, and that's why he's there and you're here, reading the Guardian like a civilised human being. Happy New Year!",

At least he didn't betray me.\"</p> <p>Whereas he did betray me, of course - with Elaine, though she is too distraught to remember. Tempted to deliver stinging reminder, but know full well that, if I did, she would burst into tears for the fourth time this morning, and I'd have to spend the rest of the day dissuading her from suicide.</p> <p>And where is Gordon? Having his post-yuletide migraine, which he is artfully prolonging in order to avoid his families. I was on the point of having a migraine myself, but the bastard got in first. \"A bit like President Clinton, then,\" I suggest.</p> <p>Elaine looks blank. \"What?\"</p> <p>\"You know - now we've seen what the next lot's like, Clinton doesn't seem so bad after all.\"</p> <p>\"Oh yes. That's right.\" She delivers this line in a tired, offhand tone. How dare I change the subject from her sacred dilemma? I must know by now that Elaine has no interest whatever in politics. But her salvation is in sight. Aunt Elspeth comes in, awash with the milk of human kindness and proffering a small bottle.</p> <p>\"Elaine, dearrr, this is my Ignatia. It's a homeopathic rrremedy for grrrief and loss. It might be worrrth a trrry.\" Elaine accepts it gratefully. She is sucking up to the aunt as if her life depends on it. \"I wonderrr, dearrr, if we ought to get anotherrr surveyorrr to take a look at your poorrr house?\"</p> <p>\"Oh, I can't bear to go back there at the moment, Auntie,\" sighs Elaine. How dare she call Elspeth auntie? She's had my husband, she's had my lover, now she wants my bleeding Great Aunt. Although Elspeth isn't strictly speaking my aunt, either. And though I saw her through her urinary crisis in Swindon, aunt may be starting to regret she gave me that large cheque recently.</p> <p>Elaine has a trump card, you see: Little Sandy, who creeps into the room and kneels down beside Aunt Elspeth's chair. He plays with his cars on her lap. Her aged knees offer an excellent opportunity for the driving-off-Beachy-Head scenario. The aunt absent-mindedly caresses Sandy's hair. Neither of my two would let her do that. Oh heck! I should have bought her a cat!</p> <p>\"I just can't face the mess, Auntie,\" pleads Elaine tremulously. \"There are turds on the mantelpiece.\"</p> <p>\" Rrreally, my dearrr ? How come?\" Aunt evidently thinks this another of Tom's dastardly deeds.</p> <p>\"The floods, you see. And the surveyor said those big cracks that appeared were really dangerous.

      "bodyText": "'I first smelled a rat when he started to go to t'ai chi three times a week.\" Elaine is lamenting the departure of treacherous Tom, who has bunked off to Italy with Francesca. I remember Francesca. She was already in the picture, luring him off on Tuscan hols, \"with a group of people\", years ago when Tom and I had our little scene. \"I realise now,\" sobs Elaine, \"it's been going on for months. He's treated me like a doormat. The bastard!\" Uneasily aware that my little scene with Tom also went on for months. Yes - I, too, was once a glamorous bastard. But I've paid for it since. Now the gods have stapled my nose to a doormat as wide as Wembley. \"Now that I know what a bastard Tom was,\" muses Elaine, \"I realise that poor old Gordon wasn't as bad as all that, after all. At least he didn't betray me.\" Whereas he did betray me, of course - with Elaine, though she is too distraught to remember. Tempted to deliver stinging reminder, but know full well that, if I did, she would burst into tears for the fourth time this morning, and I'd have to spend the rest of the day dissuading her from suicide. And where is Gordon? Having his post-yuletide migraine, which he is artfully prolonging in order to avoid his families. I was on the point of having a migraine myself, but the bastard got in first. \"A bit like President Clinton, then,\" I suggest. Elaine looks blank. \"What?\" \"You know - now we've seen what the next lot's like, Clinton doesn't seem so bad after all.\" \"Oh yes. That's right.\" She delivers this line in a tired, offhand tone. How dare I change the subject from her sacred dilemma? I must know by now that Elaine has no interest whatever in politics. But her salvation is in sight. Aunt Elspeth comes in, awash with the milk of human kindness and proffering a small bottle. \"Elaine, dearrr, this is my Ignatia. It's a homeopathic rrremedy for grrrief and loss. It might be worrrth a trrry.\" Elaine accepts it gratefully. She is sucking up to the aunt as if her life depends on it. \"I wonderrr, dearrr, if we ought to get anotherrr surveyorrr to take a look at your poorrr house?\" \"Oh, I can't bear to go back there at the moment, Auntie,\" sighs Elaine. How dare she call Elspeth auntie? She's had my husband, she's had my lover, now she wants my bleeding Great Aunt. Although Elspeth isn't strictly speaking my aunt, either. And though I saw her through her urinary crisis in Swindon, aunt may be starting to regret she gave me that large cheque recently. Elaine has a trump card, you see: Little Sandy, who creeps into the room and kneels down beside Aunt Elspeth's chair. He plays with his cars on her lap. Her aged knees offer an excellent opportunity for the driving-off-Beachy-Head scenario. The aunt absent-mindedly caresses Sandy's hair. Neither of my two would let her do that. Oh heck! I should have bought her a cat! \"I just can't face the mess, Auntie,\" pleads Elaine tremulously. \"There are turds on the mantelpiece.\" \" Rrreally, my dearrr ? How come?\" Aunt evidently thinks this another of Tom's dastardly deeds. \"The floods, you see. And the surveyor said those big cracks that appeared were really dangerous. He could get his arm into them - and he had very big arms.\" Why didn't he just wrap them around the distraught Elaine and do us all a favour? You just can't trust surveyors these days. \"The surveyors will all be on holiday for another two weeks, I bet,\" I point out, getting up briskly and hoping for a moment to myself. \"I'll go and put the kettle on.\" \"Mum?\" Harriet enters the kitchen looking puzzled. \"My radiator's gone cold.\" Oh God! The oil's run out - I knew there was something vital we'd forgotten. Aunt enters, looking grave. \"Dulcie, dearrr, we must do something to help poorrr Elaine.\" Just as long as it doesn't involve that \u00a350,000 you gave me, Auntie. Have a feeling that during the next few days we shall experience a profound cold snap just at the very moment when Elaine attempts to have the shirt off my back.

They took the act, which started as a party trick, to the 1998 Melbourne Comedy Festival, and a tour of Australia followed. They appeared at Edinburgh this year, and currently can be seen at the Whitehall Theatre, London. What is your idea of perfect happiness? To be healthy, with too much money, a wife and children, in a tropical climate. What is your greatest fear? Being unable to control my bodily functions on stage. Which living person do you most admire and why? Muhammad Ali - he broke ground as a sportsman, entertainer and an ambassador for equality. What has been your most embarrassing moment? One of my first performances of the show - no one laughed. I was asked to put my pants on and leave. What is your greatest extravagance? Fine wine and food. What objects do you always carry with you? What else but the tools of my trade. What is your favourite smell? Bacon frying. What is your favourite fantasy? Bit of a pattern emerging here: in the sun with beautiful women pouring me wine and feeding me bacon. What makes you depressed? Wars and financial woes. Should the royal family be scrapped? No, just confined to their quarters. Do you believe in capital punishment? No, people should live with their crimes. Do you believe in monogamy? Yes, but it's not for everybody. What or who is the greatest love of your life? My mother. Have you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it? Haven't we all? What is your greatest regret? Can't say I have one - it's all a learning experience. How often do you have sex? Not nearly enough. What single thing would improve the quality of your life? More sex. What would your motto be? You can't die wondering. Do you believe in life after death? Yes - I just hope they have bacon. How would you like to be remembered? I don't think I have much choice - it'll be as The Penis Man. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? Be thankful for what you have.",

Gold Label Sparkling Chardonnay (16 points out of 20, \u00a35.99), from France, is an excellent opener, for both this column and the party. It is a dry, subtly fruity bubbly that offers elegance and classic tailoring at a third of the price of a comparable champagne. </p> <p>Two further splendid M&amp;S wines, a red and a white, both in limited distribution, are Chateau de Landure Cuv\u00e9e de l'Abb\u00e9 Fr\u00e9gouse Minervois 1998 and McLean's Farm Semillon 1999, from Australia. The red is one of those wines of which people will think as they regard it on the table, 'Oh! How quaintly Gothic and expensive-looking', and when you reveal its provenance will then refuse to believe that you bought it from a high-street purveyor of underwear. This disbelief will be enhanced when they taste the fantastic fruit - chocolate, pears and blackcurrants - and superb lingering tannins. The after-taste? Pure Venezuelan chocolate - rich, dark, exotic. A stunning wine, rating 18 points and costing \u00a37.99. The white carries hints of straw and burnt butter - deliciously vegetal and toasty - which haunt the rich melon fruit that has undertones of raspberry and lemon. A beautiful wine, it, too, costs \u00a37.99 and rates 17 points. </p> <p>At Majestic there is the truly exceptional Champagne Oeil de Perdrix, a non-vintage blend rating 16 points and on offer at \u00a312.75 if you buy two bottles or more before January 29. It has an onion-skin, or partridge's eye, hue and is extremely dry and well-wrought. There is also, at this retailer, a rather terrific Cava: Freixenet Cuv\u00e9e DS 1996 (16.5 points, on offer at \u00a39.59 if you buy six bottles or more before January 29). There is stunning complexity and crispness here, and for the money it knocks Krug into a hatted cock (sorry, old joke of my history teacher). </p> <p>At Morrisons there is Castillo de Molina Reserve Chardonnay 1998 (16 points, on offer for a fiver until January 7). It is a gorgeous butter and strawberry/ melon/lemon construct. Winter Hill Red Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (14 points, two bottles for a fiver until January 7) is packed with bargain bonny fruit. Penfolds Koonunga Hill Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, on offer at \u00a33.99 until January 7) is one of this brand's best vintages for years. A beautifully couth Aussie fruit of texture, style and controlled lushness, it is deliciously succulent. Villa Montes Cabernet Sauvignon 1999 (15.5 points, on offer at \u00a33.99 until January 7), from Chile, is very ripe, severely plummy, very entertaining, and has overt tannins to give it balance and character. Rosemount Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, normally \u00a36.99, down to a fiver until January 7) is one of the most stylish Australian whites in the country. </p> <p>Another Aussie, Lindemans Bin 65 Chardonnay 2000 (16.5 points, on offer at \u00a33.99 until January 7), has acquired a nutty undertone in this vintage. It is still up there as one of the Aussie's best-value chardonnays at \u00a34.99, but with a quid off it's a fantastic bargain. </p> <p>At Oddbins there is Pierre Gimonnet et Fils 'Cuis 1er Cru' Blanc de Blancs Brut Champagne (16 points, \u00a314.99), which is hugely elegant and civilised and beats many a grande marque bubbly costing three times more. At Tesco there is Valdivieso Sparkling Merlot 1998 (16 points, \u00a35.99, 30 branches only, 0800 505555 for details), from Chile, and what an exuberant red bubbly it is. Mellow, ripe, rich, hugely fruity and great with spicy goings-on (it was a triumph with my vindaloo), as well as eccentric and vividly entertaining. </p> <p>Waitrose has its own-label non-vintage Cava Brut (15.5 points, \u00a34.99), a palate-teasing blend of local grapes that produces individuality and bite. It's on offer until January 7: buy two bottles and you save \u00a31.50 on the aggregated price. </p> <p>Booths has Concerto Lambrusco 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.49), from Italy, another sparkling red. But Lambrusco , you say? Bury, please, all snobbish thoughts. This is the real thing, as drunk in Modena or Parma with charcuterie or a robust stew.</p>",

It's on offer until January 7: buy two bottles and you save \u00a31.50 on the aggregated price. Booths has Concerto Lambrusco 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.49), from Italy, another sparkling red. But Lambrusco , you say? Bury, please, all snobbish thoughts. This is the real thing, as drunk in Modena or Parma with charcuterie or a robust stew.",

We spent 1999 planning for the millennium year, but when it arrived it was a disappointment. There was Peter Snow on millennium eve ready to chart the devastating spread of the Y2K bug, but nowhere got sick. The Dome, hyped as the globe's most exciting attraction, was a disaster. The Millennium Bridge opened to great acclaim but promptly closed again due to a wobble. Even the London Eye, now, along with Tate Modern, hailed as one of the few successes, failed to open in time for the big night. No wonder we found ourselves looking back.</p> <p>In the home, we took inspiration from the recent past: 70s suburbia was hip again, and suddenly orange was cool, green was in and anyone who was anyone was doing shagpile (albeit renamed Flokati). The 80s staged a comeback, too. Not as brash as first time around, but there was a bit of glamour and a lot of shiny black, no doubt as a reaction against the pure white minimalism of the 90s.</p> <p>We were keen to stay close to home, as well. Having travelled the globe in search of interior styles, this year we decided to see what Britain itself had to offer. Traditional became cool again as true British companies took themselves in hand. Wedgwood employed one hot modern designer after another, including Nick Munro, who took the signature blue-and-white Jasperware and relaunched it in smooth black-and-white. Thomas Goode signed up Paul Smith, Dartington Crystal called in Nigel Coates, Burberry got hip and even Peter Jones got itself a new image.</p> <p>The home-with-office-space became an increasingly popular target for designers. Working at home has its advantages - no commuting, no boss monitoring your calls, and it works well with family life - but it has disadvantages, too: such as where to put everything. Designers and that new breed of personal therapist, the storage consultant, threw themselves into the task of solving the problem. Books rolled out full of photographs of streamlined home offices and tips on how we could get the look, while ingenious computer desks, shelving systems and even an office-in-a-cupboard appeared in stores. The message was clear: to get ahead, get an efficient desk system.</p> <p>Organic was a buzzword in 2000, and not just for food. Organic living was the in thing; a look characterised by the heavy use of wood and grasses. I don't know if anybody bought one, but the interiors press went crazy for a block of oak that was turned by hip young designers Twelve into an incense burner-cum-stool. It was rustic, it was earthy and it looked great with white concrete.</p> <p>Bamboo, which is not only organic but also very Zen (another key look for 2000), was huge. We bought it as furniture, as flooring and as a garden plant. Easy to grow, it took over from more traditional plants. And if you were really with it, you got it in black. Logically, for a nation anxious to get back to nature, gardens were hip again. But not traditional gardens with patches of lawn surrounded by beds of marigolds - 2000 gardens were outdoor rooms and 2000 gardeners wouldn't be seen dead digging out and potting on. No, modern gardening is all about vast concrete walls, steel sculptures, paint, decking and the odd tropical plant. And while flowers might not have been much in evidence outside, inside they were everywhere. Florists were smart and flower prints were cool again, as modern girls realised they could like pretty things and still be successful. Of course, not everyone wanted to bring back the chintz: there were plenty of people who were more than happy in their dead plain homes. But plain was just not on. So they went geometric. Stripes came first, then circles - everything from polka-dot beakers to target tiles, then abstract and vaguely futuristic shapes championed by DNA, a Birmingham-based design company that dominated the cushion scene.</p> <p>Print also reappeared on the walls as paper returned as a credible wall covering. At least, it returned to the mocked-up homes of the style mags, which were full of Sharon Elphick's urban images, Neisha Crosland's prints and Ottilie Stevenson's traditional-meets-modern stripes and flowers. It remains to be seen if the prize of fresh, interesting walls will be enough to persuade us to go back to cutting and pasting.</p> <p>Tired of sanding, waxing and cold feet, we did not need persuading to give carpet another go, however. The boldest homeowners had a brief flirtation with patterned stuff, but it didn't take off. Years of wooden floors had made us appreciate the space-enhancing qualities of plain flooring, so swirls were out. Out, too, were carpets woven from rough grasses - they were uncomfortable and impossible to clean.</p> <p>Comfort was important, you see, and we also chose our furniture accordingly. Day beds were everywhere. Those with an interest in art and who had lots of cash went for Rachel Whiteread's version, originally made for an exhibition but later put into production by SCP; the rest of us made do with Habitat's clever brand of cheapish modern chic or went for the other style of laid-back seating, the lounger. Last seen on a crazy paving patio, loungers were this time meant to be used inside as well. The best ones were made of the kind of plastic that didn't need a foam-filled cushion to stop it sticking to your skin.</p> <p>But then, plastic was the designer's material of choice. Chairs made by everyone from Jasper Morrison to Ikea piled off production lines and into our homes, where they looked cool and wore well. The design world liked them, too: this year's 100% Design/Blueprint manufacturing award went to Magis, makers of Morrison's moulded plastic Air Chair.</p> <p>The year's other big design gong, the Peugeot Design Award, went to an unknown bloke called Hector Serrano for his fabulously tactile light, Super Patata. It was the obvious choice: this was the year of the light, and Super Patata - basically a salt-filled latex balloon that can be moulded to different shapes - represented everything that is exciting about modern lighting design.</p> <p>But it was a high point in what turned out to be rather a disappointing start to the third millennium. On the high street, everything looked much the same, with the exception of Habitat, which, with designers such as Matthew Hilton on the team, seemed to do little wrong, and Muji, which continued to expand, bringing its distinctive no-brand Japanese goods to the British people. At the other end, 100% Design, Britain's version of the Milan furniture fair, was slick but rather dull. Still, look on the bright side. No great innovations means no great change. So, if you didn't get a plastic chair and a sensual interactive light for 2000, you can always get one for 2001</p>",

I wrote to a friend in Australia on August 16 that Fergus and I (and we are self-critical) felt that the garden at Great Dixter had never looked better. The summer had been cloudy and cool, which had suited most plants admirably; nothing had scorched and the dry spells had not been exacerbated by heat.</p> <p>We had had an early spring again - our daffodil orchard was already looking its best by March 23, I noted - and were lucky to escape an April frost. Magnolias were especially magnificent. But then, in April and May, it was wet; the daffodil foliage succumbed to fungal disease and I know perfectly well that, as a consequence, next spring's display will, on the whole, be very weak. Nothing I can do about that.</p> <p>Fergus and I were far too late in planting up our Exotic Garden with all the really tender stuff that we'd grown under glass and that was kept waiting for too long. It caught up in the end, but we'd wasted a whole month. I had taken a couple of weeks off in Scotland, in the middle of June, and what with catching up with all the arrears of work on my return, this was fairly disastrous.</p> <p>So, we have made a resolution. I shall not go north until October next year (it's lovely to see the birches changing colour). Both Fergus and I will keep our diaries free of engagements for one whole week in the middle of June and really get to grips with that subtropical planting. We shall be out there at 6.30 each morning (he would have liked it to be earlier still) and can get in a couple of hours' work before the day's inevitable interruptions begin - telephone, mail, staff requiring attention, visitors and all that. At this distance in time, it looks a wonderful plan; perhaps some of it will work out.</p> <p>Then we had that fantastically wet tail end to the year. If October hadn't been by far the wettest month we (in East Sussex) have endured since we started keeping records in 1913, then November would have been. The ground is one big squelch. Thank goodness that way back in the 1460s we were sited on a hill. We look down on a lake, which is the Rother valley, and are at a safe distance. Yet I have no doubt there will be periods of drought in 2001, as in every other year.</p> <p>Really, your garden needs to be prepared for all sorts of weathers. In some departments, it will fail; in others, it will turn up trumps. In general, I am a gardening optimist. This means, inevitably, that there will be disappointments, but I also have the useful fall-back of forgetting failures extremely quickly.</p> <p>I get fed up with the killjoys who, if a fine, warm spell turns up early in the year, shake their heads and say, \"We shall pay for it later; you just see\". They cannot enjoy the present because of their wretched hypothetical future. However, I do admit that, if a fine sunny day arrives in February, it is unwise to sow masses of seeds whose progeny you will be quite unable to keep happy during the weeks and months that must elapse before it is safe, or you have the space ready, to plant them out.</p> <p>On the whole, I don't think we do a lot of planning ahead, or, if we do, we find in the end that half our schemes go by the board. Either something fails, or another plan overtakes the first one. It is no bad thing to be pragmatic and to await developments before making decisions. That said, we shall definitely make plans when deciding which seeds to order - something you may well have done already, but which we not infrequently leave until as late as February. Not on principle, certainly, but because there seem to be so many other demands on our time. Who said that winter was a slack season?</p> <p>I do not believe in change for the sake of change. There should be a more deep-seated urge, if any. I speak of a garden - mine, and very likely yours, too - that already has a good bone structure and, therefore, doesn't need to be changed.

Mind you, Drambuie itself is pretty sweet, too - and, apparently, it is drunk mainly by fellas. And Greeks of both sexes. But Drambuie Cream - 'an unashamedly luxurious fusion of 15- to 17-year-old Scotch malt whiskies, fresh dairy cream and heather honey' - is beyond sweet. Even with ice, downing a glass is like wolfing a box of Milk Tray at one sitting. So who drinks it? According to www.chilledfusion.com, surprisingly fashionable people such as the Beeb's Shaker Maker, Ben Reed, who has invented the Drambuccino, a tooth-rotting combination of espresso, Drambuie Cream, butterscotch schnapps andice, which he weirdly recommends 'for elevenses or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up' (I thought Coke was the mid-afternoon pick-me-up of choice among the chattering classes). If you nevertheless fancy a wee dram to see in the new year, it's \u00a312.99 at Sainsbury's, Bottoms Up and Wine Rack.",

The patchouli scent of Ali MacGraw hangs in the air, designers having decreed that 70s West Coast campus chic is where it's at. In designer wardrobes, Fendi patchwork jackets and Alberta Ferretti folksy milkmaid pieces rule; long, stripey scarves are swiftly adopted by the fashionable masses as a cheap, chic alternative. Meanwhile, the year's first street-generated micro trend kicks off: brightly coloured karma bead bracelets appear on wrists around town - true love and fashionability for only \u00a33. </p> <p><b> February</b><br> </p> <p> It may be winter, but in the shops it's spring: the new collections have arrived. The buzz is all about Prada. Those who consider themselves part of fashion's ruling class love a sartorial challenge, the chance to show the world that they can look good in the most unpromising of outfits. And the pussycat bows, pleated skirts and lemon-yellow sweaters that Miuccia Prada has produced are nothing if not challenging. The high-street stores that have copied her lead hold their breath to see if the public will bite. At New York fashion week, the ever-more-ostentatious use of fur brings animal rights protesters on to the catwalk. Back in London, Top Shop wins a well-deserved award for high-street design. Hussein Chalayan is named Designer Of The Year - and uses his acceptance speech to rail against a celebrity-obsessed media more interested in pop star models than in innovative design. In Milan the following week, fashion shows concede priority to the eminently pressing need to stock up on woven leather bags from newly fashionable label Bottega Veneta. </p> <p><b> March</b><br> </p> <p> Those pussycat bow blouses are still with us - it seems the office angels look is failing to capture the public's imagination. But the Charlie's Angels look is catching on months before the film's release. Flick hairstyles and tight 70s pop T-shirts turn up everywhere. Denim is rapidly becoming more fashionable than it has been since Nick Kamen took off his 501s: bleach-splashed and bleached-out emerge as successors to ubiquitous indigo Earl Jeans. And though it's still raining, the Burberry switchboard is jammed with fashionistas eager to get their hands on the year's poolside must, a check string bikini. </p> <p><b> April</b><br> </p> <p> Last year's diamant\u00e9 heart glasses having proved a little too easy for the high street to reproduce, Stella McCartney's Chloe has come up with a more elaborate design this year - smoky brown glasses with embossed gold tiger heads. Can you see out of them? No one cares. The vintage pop T-shirts that seemed so cool last season are starting to feel a bit tired, so someone has the bright idea of ripping off the sleeves and slashing the neckline. Customising goes mega and a new style of dressing is born. </p> <p><b> May</b><br> </p> <p> The silly season comes early. Unconfirmed sightings of grown men on push-along scooters mushroom into a full-blown trend. The female population, not quite stupid enough to risk life and limb on a folding silver scooter but still suckers for a pointless summer trend, take inspiration from Mariah Carey, an R&amp;B song- stress not known for her innate elegance. Suddenly, a pair of jeans isn't fit to be seen in public until you've ripped off the waist band to reveal an extra inch of tummy.

Make them jealous!\" All things luxe and logo-ed are in. But as \u00a3300 handbags are out of the reach of most, a roaring trade in fake, blackmarket Louis Vuitton is inevitable. </p> <p><b> July</b><br> </p> <p> A new style icon claims her throne: the air hostess, as idealised in TV adverts of old. Chiffon scarves, shiny patent bags the colour of love-heart sweets and itsy-bitsy wheel-along vanity cases are the height of chic. But only the very daring take the Louis Vuitton look all the way and wear coloured plastic sun visors, a look stolen from Florida tourists and suddenly, bizarrely, fashionable. </p> <p><b> August</b><br> </p> <p> With the imminent arrival of both baby Rocco and album Music, Madonna is queen of pop culture again. The cover of the single, showing her in blonde ringlets and stetson, crystallises a mood that has long bobbed around the edge of style consciousness: the rodeo girl. Usually, a trend is credible and becomes naff; Madonna takes a naff trend and makes it credible. Stetsons have been the predictable uniform of Miss Selfridge-clad clubbers for two summers, but by kitsching them to the max with full make-up and rhinestone-studded cowgirl shirts, Madge makes us realise we love them. </p> <p><b> September</b><br> </p> <p> Watching fashion types sweat in their autumn wardrobe while it's still warm is usually good for a laugh: but the arrival of autumn in June makes wearing cosy clothes in September entirely sensible. At the New York shows, the 40s look beats the 80s hands down. Anna Wintour's outfit of the week is a raspberry tweed skirt suit with ribbon belt. The return of proper skirts and shoes heralds a hosiery revival, with nude fishnets and outsize lobster nets the new accessory of choice: Jonathan Aston is the name on everyone's lips. In London, the 80s revival trundles on, with Footloose-style off-the-shoulder batwing sweaters (the kind once sold in Pineapple studios) on almost every catwalk. </p> <p><b> October</b><br> </p> <p> Milan, and the dizzying time-travel of the fashion world takes another leap, this time to the 50s.

But it took 21st-century technology to identify the molecule on the tongue that responds to it, so confirming its existence. Most of all, let us take heart from Italy, where a campaign has united the Catholic church, communists, trades unionists, environmentalists, gourmets and bar owners. In the Catholic newspaper Avvenire, Massimo Salani, a lecturer at the centre for theological studies in Pisa, called on all good Italians to begin a crusade against McDonald's and the eat-and-run culture it represents. Such eating habits, declared Signore Salani , are \"not Catholic. It completely forgets the holiness of food.\" Fast food is fit only for Lutherans. \"To reduce everything to zero, to eliminate conversation for the sake of speed,\" agreed Monsignore Domenico Sigalini, \"is to lose the sense of family.\" We'll ignore for a moment the British trend to abandon the concept of family at the first opportunity. The principle is the thing. It is time that we all adopted the rallying cry of the anti-McDonaldisti of Italy: \"Better a day of tortellini than 100 days of hamburgers.\" If God is with us, who can be against us? Who, indeed?",

      "body": "<p>It is tempting, when stock-taking the year's news, to find an individual who can encapsulate the whole thing - a villain or a hero or a victim who can tie it all up, such as OJ or Diana or Monica Lewinsky did these past years. But 2000 was different. This was a year defined not by a person but by crowds of people - or, more often, by mobs of people. </p> <p>Parents encouraged their children to smash in paedophiles' cars this year. Parents and children chanted, \"Sex case! Sex case! Hang him! Hang him!\" Portsmouth mobs attacked local paedophiles, and Gwent mobs got their words mixed up and attacked a local paediatrician. Then there was Portsmouth North's MP, Syd Rapson, admitting on TV that the violence consuming his neighbourhood frightened him. \"The house next door to me was firebombed. Then a nice person rang me and said they had made a mistake. It should have been my house that was set on fire.\" </p> <p>There were mobs, too, baying for Nasty Nick's expulsion from the Big Brother house and yelling \"Whore!\" and \"Slut!\" and \"Prick-tease!\" at his fellow housemate, Mel, the flirty one. There were telephone mobs: 300,000 Sun readers rang to protest the life sentence handed down to a Norfolk farmer who had murdered a 16-year-old burglar. The fuel protesters rose as popular heroes and fell as a mob. They went a little crazy. They said they were going to starve the country out. They prophesied Armageddon. This was a PR miscalculation. </p> <p>There were mobs that turned out to exist only in our collective imagination. For a time, Londoners envisaged themselves invaded on the tube by hordes of Romanian Gypsy women, even though they were hardly ever spotted in packs of more than one and a baby. In the Middle East, the Israelis tried to convince the outside world that the Palestinians were a mob, but the outside world was unsure. </p> <p>And there was the most outrageous mob of all - the one that utilised fake pomposity and intimidation to fix an election, that yelled and screamed and chased election officials down stairwells while their leaders went on TV mawkishly to praise their Greatest Of All Democracies. Most years hurl up some shifty individual who has the effrontery to declare himself winner of a tin-pot election, who elbows his way into power in a coup d'\u00e9tat thanks to a boorish mob. But it doesn't happen very often in the United States. </p> <p>And the year had begun so gently. A man blew a conch at sunrise on the tiny island of Kiribati, and a new millennium dawned. Nelson Mandela lit a candle inside his old cell at Robben Island. The citizens of Bangkok listened to a jazz composition by their king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. Palestinians released a flock of doves into the firework-lit skies over Bethlehem's Manger Square; admittedly, many of the doves flew straight into the fireworks and were instantly killed. </p> <p>There had been stirrings of panic beforehand. The citizens of Las Vegas emptied the shelves of the gun shops: one simply could not buy a gun in Vegas over the millennium period. But the Y2K bug failed to materialise. Had the world been duped by unscrupulous computer technicians? </p> <p>Although home secretary Jack Straw announced a week into the new year that the English had a \"propensity to violence\", January remained basically mob-free. There were, of course, ample opportunities for the crowds to turn bloody - specifically, the non-appearance of the River of Fire and the queues for the Body Zone at the Millennium Dome. The pyrotechnicians later explained that the River of Fire had actually gone according to plan but, travelling as it had at the same pace as earth and time, the human race was not advanced enough to see it. This was either a very inventive lie or the 21st century's first great philosophical conundrum. If the River of Fire was not seen, could it be said to have existed? </p> <p>Downriver that same night, the nation's glitterati, alongside various raffle winners and unsung heroes, queued for three long hours to board trains bound for the Dome. The Dome chief, Lord Falconer, a close friend of the prime minister, later apologised to \"the VIPs and the ordinary people\". The phrase \"close friend of the prime minister\" became 2000's most trenchant term of abuse. </p> <p>\"The trouble with queuing,\" wrote the Guardian's Polly Toynbee in the year's first major Dome savaging, \"is that expectations rise exponentially with every minute queued. If you stand outside the Body Zone for an hour, it had better be worth it, but all you get is seven minutes of nothing much.\" The Body Zone had been billed as \"an intellectually accessible exploration into the most fascinating object in the world, the human body\". This turned out to be essentially true. It was intellectually accessible: a hollowed-out lump of Perspex surrounding an escalator that led to a hunk of throbbing rubber - the human heart. </p> <p>Most wounding for the Dome was the single-word headline in the London Evening Standard on February 1 underneath a photograph of the Millennium Wheel. That word was: \"Fabulous.\" </p> <p>In April, a Norfolk farmer, Tony Martin, was jailed for life for shooting a 16-year-old burglar, Fred Barras, as he tried to escape from his home. The boy was killed by an illegal, pump-action shotgun. He was shot twice in the legs, once in the back. Although Barras had 29 prior convictions for robbery, the burglary of Martin's farm was to be his big break into the criminal mainstream. Barras's final words, having been shot by Martin, were, \"Give over, give over. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" Then he said, \"Mum ...\" and died. There was widespread anger at the murder conviction. Up to 300,000 Sun readers rang the paper to protest. \"Plagued by thieving pykies,\" wrote the Sun, \"Martin was let down by the police - there was no bobby in his village - and by toothless courts, leaving repeat offenders free to prey on decent hard-working people.\" Conservative leader William Hague assured Martin's supporters that under a Tory government the law would favour householders defending themselves. </p> <p>Martin had, for 18 months before the shooting, worked himself into a frenzy. He had sealed his windows, patrolled his property with a loaded gun and yelled at passers-by, \"I'll blow the heads off thieves and machine-gun Gypsies.\" But as a metaphor he became a downtrodden rural Englishman protecting his castle against the worst sort of foreign invader, a Gypsy. </p> <p>Hague assured the Gypsy-haters that under a Tory government the \"floods of Kosovars and Romanian Gypsies swamping soft-touch Britain\" would be locked in detention centres. It was unappealing, like the rest of Hague's catalogue of soundbites in 2000. When he told GQ that he used to drink 14 pints a day, the PR man Max Clifford summed up his image problem: \"It doesn't actually matter whether it's true or not. You don't look at him and see a 14-pint man.\" </p> <p>In May, Tony Blair might well have become the first serving Labour prime minister to vote Tory in an election. Of course, he refused to say for whom he cast his second preference vote in London's mayoral poll, but Downing Street was so transfixed in its belief that only Steven Norris could stop the man bent on reducing London to ashes that the odds are the prime minister did put his cross in that most bizarre of boxes. </p> <p>Ken Livingstone was an issue that stretched liberal commentators almost to breaking point. Even the Guardian fleetingly contemplated supporting Norris, to the horror of some staff members. The editor, Alan Rusbridger, pointed out that, in October 1951, the Manchester Guardian advised, \"For the next few years, a Churchill government is, it seems to us, the lesser evil.\" In the end, the Guardian supported nobody. It was, anyway, a foregone conclusion. \"Londoners,\" wrote Geoffrey Wheatcroft in the Guardian, \"are going to the polls like schoolchildren who know they are doing something naughty to tease the grown-ups.\" </p> <p>On July 1, police were called to investigate the disappearance of a little girl from a country lane near her grandparents' home in West Sussex. The girl had been playing with her sister and brothers, but decided to return home on her own. Initial police reports were optimistic. Sarah Payne was probably just hiding in the fields. But the search parties found nothing. Sarah's parents appeared on TV every day, raging helplessly against what was becoming increasingly obvious. </p> <p>On July 3: \"We need her home now, today. She is the most important thing in our lives. She is our life. We have a family name for her, our little princess. She is soft, gentle, likeable. She has not got a horrible vein in her body.\" </p> <p>On July 4: \"Just drop Sarah somewhere she can be found. Let her walk away from you.\" </p> <p>On July 5: \"We are coming. I know we are taking our time. Hang in there, girl, because we are coming for you.\" </p> <p>There was hope on July 9. At Knutsford services a woman approached a frightened little girl and asked her name. \"Sarah,\" she said. </p> <p>On July 15: \"We know that Sarah is still alive. It is a gut instinct. We are certain of it.\" </p> <p>Sarah's body was found on the 17th. She had been murdered during the first weekend in July. Grief quickly turned into something else. \"NAMED SHAMED\" read the headline in the News of the World. \"If you are a parent you must read this. There are 110,000 child sex offenders in Britain. The murder of Sarah Payne has proved police monitoring of these perverts is not enough. So we are revealing WHO they are and WHERE they are, starting today.\" The News of the World's editor, Rebekah Wade, called for \"vigilance not vigilantism\". The vigilante attacks, of course, began within hours. In Manchester, a 300-strong mob surrounded the home of Ian Armstrong, who was mistaken for a paedophile because he shared a surname with a man named by the News of the World. They backed a six-year-old boy down his garden path and shouted, \"Do you want this one?\" </p> <p>Once the misunderstanding had been cleared up, the News of the World scored a bizarre victory by parading Armstrong at a press conference. \"I support the News of the World's campaign to name and shame paedophiles,\" he quivered. </p> <p>The residents of the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth drew up a \"mental list\" of the 20 most likely paedophiles in their neighbourhood. They set about attacking the homes of those on the list. They admitted to suspecting one man because he lived alone and talked about how much he loved his mother. A 17-year-old boy was included because his girlfriend was 15. The protesters paraded their children for the cameras. A three-year-old held up a sign as if she was supporting her village fete. It read: \"Kill Paedophiles!\" Five innocent families fled the estate, terrified of their neighbours. The campaign's self-proclaimed leader, Katrina Kessell, declared that if they felt compelled to run away because of guilty thoughts then it was their own fault. It was during one of her many TV interviews that Kessell's three-year-old son was found wandering near a busy road half-a-mile from their home. Social services was alerted. </p> <p>From time to time, the mobs succeeded in their goal of targeting actual paedophiles. A gang attacked the home of James White, who had pleaded guilty to three indecent assaults on young girls. They threw missiles and informed him that they would come back later and firebomb his house. White worried about his wife and children. He drove to a service station on the M61 and took a massive overdose of the tranquilliser, Diltiazen. One of White's neighbours, a mother-of-four, said: \"He was an animal and he probably got off lightly taking his own life like this.\" </p> <p>Hague assured the rioters that under a Tory government Britain's most dangerous paedophiles would be jailed for life. \"The protesters' emotions,\" he said, \"are strong and understandable.\" </p> <p>It turned out that the majority of the names on the Portsmouth \"mental list\" were indeed convicted paedophiles, a disproportionate number of whom had been re-housed on the Paulsgrove estate, many within yards of the local school. </p> <p>The summer weather was bad. Leeds had only 12 minutes of sunshine during the first eight days of July. On July 14, 10 people were locked into a house in London's East End, with 25 cameras following their every move. Some of the housemates immediately stripped naked and covered themselves in clay. The critics united in predicting a giant flop. \"Big Brother is deeply dull,\" wrote the Daily Telegraph. \"When the winner is announced in nine weeks, will anybody care?\" The contestants were deemed vacuous and one-dimensional. And then one of them, Nick Bateman, began to behave oddly. A graduate of Gordonstoun, Bateman befriended his housemates and craftily set them against each other. He built himself an immunity from eviction with made-up stories of a harrowing past. His first love was, he falsely announced, killed in a car crash on their honeymoon in Australia. There were gasps of sympathy from his housemates. The nation was gripped. Was there a psychopath in the Big Brother house? The broadsheet intelligentsia went into hyperdrive. </p> <p>\"His deviousness has a Shakespearean breadth to it,\" wrote Emma Brockes in the Guardian. \"You can imagine him as Edmund in King Lear, standing on the lawn at midnight and shaking his fist at the moon: 'Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law my services are bound.' \" </p> <p>The Sun launched a \"Kick Out Nick\" campaign. Nick was kicked out; 28 British papers put him on their front cover that day. The Sun signed him up. Like a comic pastiche of the anti-paedophile riots occurring simultaneously across the country, Channel 4 viewers swarmed the Big Brother set every Friday night to cheer or boo the evicted housemates. \"It's history, isn't it?\" said one viewer. \"It's like watching Neil Armstrong on the moon or Diana's funeral.\" By the end of the year, it was as if we were collectively embarrassed by our fleeting devotion to the show. \"It's Fame Over For Big Bruv Craig,\" laughed the Daily Star. The housemates were like victims of a one-night stand, wondering what they'd done wrong, why we didn't like them any more, especially when things were going so well. </p> <p>The man charged with the murder of TV star Jill Dando turned out not to be a Serb hitman, nor a revenge-obsessed criminal unmasked on Crimewatch, not even an obsessive Dando fan. He was a Freddie Mercury fan. What could be said about that? </p> <p>The music impresario Jonathan King was charged with a crime dating back 30 years - the same charge that had destroyed Oscar Wilde's life: the buggering of a teenage boy. The trials of King and the Dando suspect are still pending. </p> <p>George Harrison's attacker was simply on the wrong medication. When he was put back on to the right medication, he apologised profusely. The London nailbomber, it turned out, represented nothing but his own lonely, hateful insanity. </p> <p>Sarah Payne's murderer remained faceless, uncaught, as invisible as a wisp of air. As did the year's other dreadful killer. In Bridgend, during the millennium celebrations, a woman called Karen Beavon began to complain of a bad back. She felt depressed. A few weeks later she asked her husband if it was true that a family of Australians was living in their house. She started making the imaginary Australians cups of tea. But she couldn't get the tea right. The cups were full of cold water. She thought the Australians were staying upstairs. When her husband pointed out to her that they lived in a bungalow, she became agitated. She accused her husband of trying to murder her. </p> <p>Karen went blind, and then deaf. She was 37 when new-variant CJD killed her, on July 15, seven months after she had first complained of a bad back. </p> <p>The disease claimed its youngest life three months later. Microscopic holes had formed in the brain of 14-year-old Zoe Jeffries, whose two great loves were cheeseburgers and Leonardo DiCaprio. \"It's as if someone had stuck a knife in her body,\" said her mother. \"I really do think she has been murdered.\" But she blamed herself, too. She said she felt guilty for not buying Zoe more expensive hamburgers. October's 14,000-page BSE report refused to point fingers. No one was blamed. It failed to provide conclusions. It just told us what we already know: that we know very little. </p> <p>In Gaza, a 12-year-old boy, Mohammed al-Durrah, went out with his father to buy a second-hand car on a Saturday morning. They blundered into the path of Israeli soldiers. The boy hid behind his father's back for safety and was killed, a clean shot. The spinning began in earnest. The Israeli army said that the boy and his father couldn't have \"been there by accident. They were there like the others throwing stones, and throwing Molotovs.\" They added that the boy was probably killed by \"his fellow rioters\". This false claim backfired. The Israelis did their best to regain the high ground by announcing that the Palestinians were cynically dispatching their own children to die for the cameras. But even if this was true, why were the Israelis so keen to kill them? The martyring of one's own children no longer seemed like the crazy behaviour of an otherworldly people. It suddenly seemed human instead. The Israelis appeared to the world like old-fashioned monsters: like a mob. </p> <p>A series of posters appeared overnight across London and the Midlands, calling for the death of Jews. Omar Bakri Mohamed, of Tottenham's Al Muhajiroun, denied circulating them, even though his mobile telephone number was printed at the bottom. He said he had been framed by unknown forces (possibly the Zionist-controlled British media). In Stamford Hill, a Jewish student was brutally stabbed on a bus while reading the Talmud. </p> <p>That same week, a Saudi airliner bound for London was politely seized by - in the hijackers' own words - \"Saudi people subjugated to American hegemony\". It was a low-key hijack. The passengers only realised things were askew when, upon landing, they looked out of the windows to see an airport that was clearly not Heathrow. \"It was a small airport, and there were signs in Arabic,\" said hostage Chris Fowler from Newport. \"It was then that I knew something was up.\" </p> <p>It was Saddam International Airport. The hijack had, it transpired, coincided with the launch of Iraqi Tourism Week. The instantly released hostages were put up for the day at the five star Al-Rashid hotel, which was covered in an enormous banner of Saddam wearing a ski-suit and goggles. They were laden with glossy brochures extolling the attractions of Baghdad and sent back to London the same day. \"Come again,\" the Iraqi officials told them. \"Next time for a holiday.\" </p> <p>Saddam suddenly didn't seem quite so bad after all, and our foreign secretary Robin Cook, with Iraq under sanctions, appeared curmudgeonly when he refused to thank him for resolving the crisis so speedily. \"I would not thank any government for carrying out its clear international obligation to stop a terrorist hijack,\" he explained. </p> <p>\"It's all a bit too slick,\" added one diplomat. \"The speed with which the negotiations were completed - it all resolved itself remarkably quickly.\" So, was the whole thing a set-up, a spin, a magic trick, designed to promote Iraqi Tourism Week? Whatever, the spectre of the Islamic world beating the west at its own game by engaging in successful PR was a whole new concept for 2000. </p> <p>The Weird Hijack proved to be one of the year's most enduring mini-themes. Back in February, an Afghan plane on an internal flight was seized and diverted to London Stansted where, the Telegraph reported, the hijackers were given a cushy time. \"They have been offered fizzy drinks, hot towels, and muffins for tea.\" This outrage, compounded by the collective memory of economy flights, where muffins and hot towels are something to be only dreamed of, paled against the theory that followed: were the hijackers and passengers in cahoots? Was it all an elaborate ruse for the 170 on board to obtain political asylum? When the crisis was resolved, it transpired that 81 of those on board immediately returned home, 14 were charged with kidnapping, and the rest currently have pending asylum applications. </p> <p>Neither hijack was quite as odd as the one perpetrated by Augusto Lakandula in May. A Philippine airbus was minutes from landing at Manila when Lakandula leapt to his feet and explained to the 278 passengers on board that his wife was having an affair with a policeman. He then ran up and down the aisle grabbing cash and valuables from passengers. He tied a home-made parachute to his back. It was made of string and bed sheets. He ordered a stewardess to open the door. She obliged. Unfortunately, his backpack was bulging so profusely from his hoarded valuables that he got stuck in the doorway. So the stewardess pushed him out. </p> <p>\"If he survived that jump with that parachute,\" a Philippine Airlines spokesman later said, \"he deserves to keep all the money because that would be the miracle of the century.\" Lakandula's body was found submerged in mud outside Manila the next day. His unopened parachute lay next to his body. </p> <p>All three hijacks had been resolved without any passengers losing their lives, which is more than can be said for Qantas's September 30 flight from Sydney to London. Emma Christoffersen, a Marks &amp; Spencer sales assistant from Newport, was returning home from a three-week trip to Australia. It was a 20-hour flight. She flew economy. There was inadequate leg-room. A blood clot formed in a vein in her leg. It travelled to her heart. She collapsed in the Heathrow arrivals lounge and died minutes later. It wasn't terrorism that killed Christoffersen. It was business. </p> <p>August saw the unfolding of that most tragic of tales - the boy trapped down the well. In this instance, there were 118 boys, the well was the Kursk submarine. Russia's premier, Vladimir Putin, dithered for days over whether to accept foreign offers of help, even though his navy had no deep-sea-diving team. The country's government refused to publish a list of the trapped sailors. Finally, a Russian journalist bribed a navy official. He slid the equivalent of \u00a3440 into his pocket. The official handed over the list. This was how the sailors' mothers discovered that their children were dead or dying in the submarine. </p> <p>Putin's government chose old-fashioned means to stifle what they perceived to be a mob of devastated mothers. One woman began yelling at a deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov. \"They are there in a tin can!\" she screamed. \"Do you have children? Surely not!\" She was grabbed by men in suits, injected with some kind of sedative and carried out. She was later paraded at a press conference. \"I am glad they sedated me because I have a heart condition and I may have died without the sedative,\" she said. A note later found in the pocket of one of the corpses on board the submarine revealed that some of the crew died slowly. The Russian authorities only allowed a few lines of the note to be published. \"I'm writing blind ... There are 23 of us here ...\" The rest was considered too tragic, or too politically sensitive, to be known: fragments of fragments, written in the dark at the bottom of the sea. </p> <p>On September 7, in a livestock market in North Wales, a softly-spoken farmer - wounded by the BSE crisis and rising fuel prices - was about to bring Britain to a shuddering halt. \"If you're not with us then leave now,\" said Brynle Williams to the 150 gathered farmers and hauliers. \"No one will think the worse of you.\" It had taken Williams just 10 minutes to organise his protest. There was no headed paper, no website, no infrastructure, just 150 rural working people with mobile phones, alienated by what they saw as an urban, cosmopolitan (Labour) government. </p> <p>Within days, all of Britain's refineries were barricaded by Williams's men. Blair learned of the blockades while staying at the Sheffield Hilton. He was due to visit a local school early the next morning. Frantic calls were made between Sheffield and London. How could the prime minister return to London without being photographed? A dash to the capital would have looked terrible in the press - as if there were a crisis. So a plot was hatched. Nobody would tell the school that Blair wasn't going to show up. Instead, he'd sneak to Sheffield station, hide on a train, and be smuggled out of a side door at St Pancras. </p> <p>It was a triumph. At 8.50am, while the groomed and excited Sheffield schoolchildren were all lined up and the photographers at the ready, Blair was zipping unchronicled back to London. For all the uncertainty that gripped Britain during the fuel crisis, one thing wassure: the prime minister knew how to avoid being photographed looking panicky. Ninety per cent of the British public supported the protests, and it was nice to see some old- fashioned solidarity to a cause, even if cheap fuel was not the noblest of crusades. But then the People's Fuel Lobby went power-crazy. They labelled themselves the New Jarrow Crusaders and prophesied Armageddon if their demands were not met: \"This is a historic crusade. People can live without fuel but they cannot live without food.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Read part two <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,416111,00.html\"> here </a>.</p>",

If you stand outside the Body Zone for an hour, it had better be worth it, but all you get is seven minutes of nothing much.\" The Body Zone had been billed as \"an intellectually accessible exploration into the most fascinating object in the world, the human body\". This turned out to be essentially true. It was intellectually accessible: a hollowed-out lump of Perspex surrounding an escalator that led to a hunk of throbbing rubber - the human heart. Most wounding for the Dome was the single-word headline in the London Evening Standard on February 1 underneath a photograph of the Millennium Wheel. That word was: \"Fabulous.\" In April, a Norfolk farmer, Tony Martin, was jailed for life for shooting a 16-year-old burglar, Fred Barras, as he tried to escape from his home. The boy was killed by an illegal, pump-action shotgun. He was shot twice in the legs, once in the back. Although Barras had 29 prior convictions for robbery, the burglary of Martin's farm was to be his big break into the criminal mainstream. Barras's final words, having been shot by Martin, were, \"Give over, give over. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" Then he said, \"Mum ...\" and died. There was widespread anger at the murder conviction. Up to 300,000 Sun readers rang the paper to protest. \"Plagued by thieving pykies,\" wrote the Sun, \"Martin was let down by the police - there was no bobby in his village - and by toothless courts, leaving repeat offenders free to prey on decent hard-working people.\" Conservative leader William Hague assured Martin's supporters that under a Tory government the law would favour householders defending themselves. Martin had, for 18 months before the shooting, worked himself into a frenzy. He had sealed his windows, patrolled his property with a loaded gun and yelled at passers-by, \"I'll blow the heads off thieves and machine-gun Gypsies.\" But as a metaphor he became a downtrodden rural Englishman protecting his castle against the worst sort of foreign invader, a Gypsy. Hague assured the Gypsy-haters that under a Tory government the \"floods of Kosovars and Romanian Gypsies swamping soft-touch Britain\" would be locked in detention centres. It was unappealing, like the rest of Hague's catalogue of soundbites in 2000. When he told GQ that he used to drink 14 pints a day, the PR man Max Clifford summed up his image problem: \"It doesn't actually matter whether it's true or not. You don't look at him and see a 14-pint man.\" In May, Tony Blair might well have become the first serving Labour prime minister to vote Tory in an election. Of course, he refused to say for whom he cast his second preference vote in London's mayoral poll, but Downing Street was so transfixed in its belief that only Steven Norris could stop the man bent on reducing London to ashes that the odds are the prime minister did put his cross in that most bizarre of boxes. Ken Livingstone was an issue that stretched liberal commentators almost to breaking point. Even the Guardian fleetingly contemplated supporting Norris, to the horror of some staff members. The editor, Alan Rusbridger, pointed out that, in October 1951, the Manchester Guardian advised, \"For the next few years, a Churchill government is, it seems to us, the lesser evil.\" In the end, the Guardian supported nobody. It was, anyway, a foregone conclusion. \"Londoners,\" wrote Geoffrey Wheatcroft in the Guardian, \"are going to the polls like schoolchildren who know they are doing something naughty to tease the grown-ups.\" On July 1, police were called to investigate the disappearance of a little girl from a country lane near her grandparents' home in West Sussex. The girl had been playing with her sister and brothers, but decided to return home on her own. Initial police reports were optimistic. Sarah Payne was probably just hiding in the fields. But the search parties found nothing. Sarah's parents appeared on TV every day, raging helplessly against what was becoming increasingly obvious. On July 3: \"We need her home now, today. She is the most important thing in our lives. She is our life. We have a family name for her, our little princess. She is soft, gentle, likeable. She has not got a horrible vein in her body.\" On July 4: \"Just drop Sarah somewhere she can be found. Let her walk away from you.\" On July 5: \"We are coming. I know we are taking our time. Hang in there, girl, because we are coming for you.\" There was hope on July 9. At Knutsford services a woman approached a frightened little girl and asked her name. \"Sarah,\" she said. On July 15: \"We know that Sarah is still alive. It is a gut instinct. We are certain of it.\" Sarah's body was found on the 17th. She had been murdered during the first weekend in July. Grief quickly turned into something else. \"NAMED SHAMED\" read the headline in the News of the World. \"If you are a parent you must read this. There are 110,000 child sex offenders in Britain. The murder of Sarah Payne has proved police monitoring of these perverts is not enough. So we are revealing WHO they are and WHERE they are, starting today.\" The News of the World's editor, Rebekah Wade, called for \"vigilance not vigilantism\". The vigilante attacks, of course, began within hours. In Manchester, a 300-strong mob surrounded the home of Ian Armstrong, who was mistaken for a paedophile because he shared a surname with a man named by the News of the World. They backed a six-year-old boy down his garden path and shouted, \"Do you want this one?\" Once the misunderstanding had been cleared up, the News of the World scored a bizarre victory by parading Armstrong at a press conference. \"I support the News of the World's campaign to name and shame paedophiles,\" he quivered. The residents of the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth drew up a \"mental list\" of the 20 most likely paedophiles in their neighbourhood. They set about attacking the homes of those on the list. They admitted to suspecting one man because he lived alone and talked about how much he loved his mother. A 17-year-old boy was included because his girlfriend was 15. The protesters paraded their children for the cameras. A three-year-old held up a sign as if she was supporting her village fete. It read: \"Kill Paedophiles!\" Five innocent families fled the estate, terrified of their neighbours. The campaign's self-proclaimed leader, Katrina Kessell, declared that if they felt compelled to run away because of guilty thoughts then it was their own fault. It was during one of her many TV interviews that Kessell's three-year-old son was found wandering near a busy road half-a-mile from their home. Social services was alerted. From time to time, the mobs succeeded in their goal of targeting actual paedophiles. A gang attacked the home of James White, who had pleaded guilty to three indecent assaults on young girls. They threw missiles and informed him that they would come back later and firebomb his house. White worried about his wife and children. He drove to a service station on the M61 and took a massive overdose of the tranquilliser, Diltiazen. One of White's neighbours, a mother-of-four, said: \"He was an animal and he probably got off lightly taking his own life like this.\" Hague assured the rioters that under a Tory government Britain's most dangerous paedophiles would be jailed for life. \"The protesters' emotions,\" he said, \"are strong and understandable.\" It turned out that the majority of the names on the Portsmouth \"mental list\" were indeed convicted paedophiles, a disproportionate number of whom had been re-housed on the Paulsgrove estate, many within yards of the local school. The summer weather was bad. Leeds had only 12 minutes of sunshine during the first eight days of July. On July 14, 10 people were locked into a house in London's East End, with 25 cameras following their every move. Some of the housemates immediately stripped naked and covered themselves in clay. The critics united in predicting a giant flop. \"Big Brother is deeply dull,\" wrote the Daily Telegraph. \"When the winner is announced in nine weeks, will anybody care?\" The contestants were deemed vacuous and one-dimensional. And then one of them, Nick Bateman, began to behave oddly. A graduate of Gordonstoun, Bateman befriended his housemates and craftily set them against each other. He built himself an immunity from eviction with made-up stories of a harrowing past. His first love was, he falsely announced, killed in a car crash on their honeymoon in Australia. There were gasps of sympathy from his housemates. The nation was gripped. Was there a psychopath in the Big Brother house? The broadsheet intelligentsia went into hyperdrive. \"His deviousness has a Shakespearean breadth to it,\" wrote Emma Brockes in the Guardian. \"You can imagine him as Edmund in King Lear, standing on the lawn at midnight and shaking his fist at the moon: 'Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law my services are bound.' \" The Sun launched a \"Kick Out Nick\" campaign. Nick was kicked out; 28 British papers put him on their front cover that day. The Sun signed him up. Like a comic pastiche of the anti-paedophile riots occurring simultaneously across the country, Channel 4 viewers swarmed the Big Brother set every Friday night to cheer or boo the evicted housemates. \"It's history, isn't it?\" said one viewer. \"It's like watching Neil Armstrong on the moon or Diana's funeral.\" By the end of the year, it was as if we were collectively embarrassed by our fleeting devotion to the show. \"It's Fame Over For Big Bruv Craig,\" laughed the Daily Star. The housemates were like victims of a one-night stand, wondering what they'd done wrong, why we didn't like them any more, especially when things were going so well. The man charged with the murder of TV star Jill Dando turned out not to be a Serb hitman, nor a revenge-obsessed criminal unmasked on Crimewatch, not even an obsessive Dando fan. He was a Freddie Mercury fan. What could be said about that? The music impresario Jonathan King was charged with a crime dating back 30 years - the same charge that had destroyed Oscar Wilde's life: the buggering of a teenage boy. The trials of King and the Dando suspect are still pending. George Harrison's attacker was simply on the wrong medication. When he was put back on to the right medication, he apologised profusely. The London nailbomber, it turned out, represented nothing but his own lonely, hateful insanity. Sarah Payne's murderer remained faceless, uncaught, as invisible as a wisp of air. As did the year's other dreadful killer. In Bridgend, during the millennium celebrations, a woman called Karen Beavon began to complain of a bad back. She felt depressed. A few weeks later she asked her husband if it was true that a family of Australians was living in their house. She started making the imaginary Australians cups of tea. But she couldn't get the tea right. The cups were full of cold water. She thought the Australians were staying upstairs. When her husband pointed out to her that they lived in a bungalow, she became agitated. She accused her husband of trying to murder her. Karen went blind, and then deaf. She was 37 when new-variant CJD killed her, on July 15, seven months after she had first complained of a bad back. The disease claimed its youngest life three months later. Microscopic holes had formed in the brain of 14-year-old Zoe Jeffries, whose two great loves were cheeseburgers and Leonardo DiCaprio. \"It's as if someone had stuck a knife in her body,\" said her mother. \"I really do think she has been murdered.\" But she blamed herself, too. She said she felt guilty for not buying Zoe more expensive hamburgers. October's 14,000-page BSE report refused to point fingers. No one was blamed. It failed to provide conclusions. It just told us what we already know: that we know very little. In Gaza, a 12-year-old boy, Mohammed al-Durrah, went out with his father to buy a second-hand car on a Saturday morning. They blundered into the path of Israeli soldiers. The boy hid behind his father's back for safety and was killed, a clean shot. The spinning began in earnest. The Israeli army said that the boy and his father couldn't have \"been there by accident. They were there like the others throwing stones, and throwing Molotovs.\" They added that the boy was probably killed by \"his fellow rioters\". This false claim backfired. The Israelis did their best to regain the high ground by announcing that the Palestinians were cynically dispatching their own children to die for the cameras. But even if this was true, why were the Israelis so keen to kill them? The martyring of one's own children no longer seemed like the crazy behaviour of an otherworldly people. It suddenly seemed human instead. The Israelis appeared to the world like old-fashioned monsters: like a mob. A series of posters appeared overnight across London and the Midlands, calling for the death of Jews. Omar Bakri Mohamed, of Tottenham's Al Muhajiroun, denied circulating them, even though his mobile telephone number was printed at the bottom. He said he had been framed by unknown forces (possibly the Zionist-controlled British media). In Stamford Hill, a Jewish student was brutally stabbed on a bus while reading the Talmud. That same week, a Saudi airliner bound for London was politely seized by - in the hijackers' own words - \"Saudi people subjugated to American hegemony\". It was a low-key hijack. The passengers only realised things were askew when, upon landing, they looked out of the windows to see an airport that was clearly not Heathrow. \"It was a small airport, and there were signs in Arabic,\" said hostage Chris Fowler from Newport. \"It was then that I knew something was up.\" It was Saddam International Airport. The hijack had, it transpired, coincided with the launch of Iraqi Tourism Week. The instantly released hostages were put up for the day at the five star Al-Rashid hotel, which was covered in an enormous banner of Saddam wearing a ski-suit and goggles. They were laden with glossy brochures extolling the attractions of Baghdad and sent back to London the same day. \"Come again,\" the Iraqi officials told them. \"Next time for a holiday.\" Saddam suddenly didn't seem quite so bad after all, and our foreign secretary Robin Cook, with Iraq under sanctions, appeared curmudgeonly when he refused to thank him for resolving the crisis so speedily. \"I would not thank any government for carrying out its clear international obligation to stop a terrorist hijack,\" he explained. \"It's all a bit too slick,\" added one diplomat. \"The speed with which the negotiations were completed - it all resolved itself remarkably quickly.\" So, was the whole thing a set-up, a spin, a magic trick, designed to promote Iraqi Tourism Week? Whatever, the spectre of the Islamic world beating the west at its own game by engaging in successful PR was a whole new concept for 2000. The Weird Hijack proved to be one of the year's most enduring mini-themes. Back in February, an Afghan plane on an internal flight was seized and diverted to London Stansted where, the Telegraph reported, the hijackers were given a cushy time. \"They have been offered fizzy drinks, hot towels, and muffins for tea.\" This outrage, compounded by the collective memory of economy flights, where muffins and hot towels are something to be only dreamed of, paled against the theory that followed: were the hijackers and passengers in cahoots? Was it all an elaborate ruse for the 170 on board to obtain political asylum? When the crisis was resolved, it transpired that 81 of those on board immediately returned home, 14 were charged with kidnapping, and the rest currently have pending asylum applications. Neither hijack was quite as odd as the one perpetrated by Augusto Lakandula in May. A Philippine airbus was minutes from landing at Manila when Lakandula leapt to his feet and explained to the 278 passengers on board that his wife was having an affair with a policeman. He then ran up and down the aisle grabbing cash and valuables from passengers. He tied a home-made parachute to his back. It was made of string and bed sheets. He ordered a stewardess to open the door. She obliged. Unfortunately, his backpack was bulging so profusely from his hoarded valuables that he got stuck in the doorway. So the stewardess pushed him out. \"If he survived that jump with that parachute,\" a Philippine Airlines spokesman later said, \"he deserves to keep all the money because that would be the miracle of the century.\" Lakandula's body was found submerged in mud outside Manila the next day. His unopened parachute lay next to his body. All three hijacks had been resolved without any passengers losing their lives, which is more than can be said for Qantas's September 30 flight from Sydney to London. Emma Christoffersen, a Marks &amp; Spencer sales assistant from Newport, was returning home from a three-week trip to Australia. It was a 20-hour flight. She flew economy. There was inadequate leg-room. A blood clot formed in a vein in her leg. It travelled to her heart. She collapsed in the Heathrow arrivals lounge and died minutes later. It wasn't terrorism that killed Christoffersen. It was business. August saw the unfolding of that most tragic of tales - the boy trapped down the well. In this instance, there were 118 boys, the well was the Kursk submarine. Russia's premier, Vladimir Putin, dithered for days over whether to accept foreign offers of help, even though his navy had no deep-sea-diving team. The country's government refused to publish a list of the trapped sailors. Finally, a Russian journalist bribed a navy official. He slid the equivalent of \u00a3440 into his pocket. The official handed over the list. This was how the sailors' mothers discovered that their children were dead or dying in the submarine. Putin's government chose old-fashioned means to stifle what they perceived to be a mob of devastated mothers. One woman began yelling at a deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov. \"They are there in a tin can!\" she screamed. \"Do you have children? Surely not!\" She was grabbed by men in suits, injected with some kind of sedative and carried out. She was later paraded at a press conference. \"I am glad they sedated me because I have a heart condition and I may have died without the sedative,\" she said. A note later found in the pocket of one of the corpses on board the submarine revealed that some of the crew died slowly. The Russian authorities only allowed a few lines of the note to be published. \"I'm writing blind ... There are 23 of us here ...\" The rest was considered too tragic, or too politically sensitive, to be known: fragments of fragments, written in the dark at the bottom of the sea. On September 7, in a livestock market in North Wales, a softly-spoken farmer - wounded by the BSE crisis and rising fuel prices - was about to bring Britain to a shuddering halt. \"If you're not with us then leave now,\" said Brynle Williams to the 150 gathered farmers and hauliers. \"No one will think the worse of you.\" It had taken Williams just 10 minutes to organise his protest. There was no headed paper, no website, no infrastructure, just 150 rural working people with mobile phones, alienated by what they saw as an urban, cosmopolitan (Labour) government. Within days, all of Britain's refineries were barricaded by Williams's men. Blair learned of the blockades while staying at the Sheffield Hilton. He was due to visit a local school early the next morning. Frantic calls were made between Sheffield and London. How could the prime minister return to London without being photographed? A dash to the capital would have looked terrible in the press - as if there were a crisis. So a plot was hatched. Nobody would tell the school that Blair wasn't going to show up. Instead, he'd sneak to Sheffield station, hide on a train, and be smuggled out of a side door at St Pancras. It was a triumph. At 8.50am, while the groomed and excited Sheffield schoolchildren were all lined up and the photographers at the ready, Blair was zipping unchronicled back to London. For all the uncertainty that gripped Britain during the fuel crisis, one thing wassure: the prime minister knew how to avoid being photographed looking panicky. Ninety per cent of the British public supported the protests, and it was nice to see some old- fashioned solidarity to a cause, even if cheap fuel was not the noblest of crusades. But then the People's Fuel Lobby went power-crazy. They labelled themselves the New Jarrow Crusaders and prophesied Armageddon if their demands were not met: \"This is a historic crusade. People can live without fuel but they cannot live without food.\" \u0095 Read part two here .",

      "body": "<p>From a restaurateur's selfish point of view, I have a preference for New Year's Day over the New Year's Eve shindig, which revolves around seemingly ocean-sized quantities of alcohol. Sure, there is an undeniable thrill to be had from being out and about at the stroke of midnight, all wrapped up in great layers of woollens and other cosies, but I'm usually at work on New Year's Eve, so I have no qualms in putting those particular memories behind me.</p> <p>As luck would have it, an old pal phoned me a few weeks back and asked if he could come to the restaurant for lunch on New Year's Day. \"Of course - I'd be delighted! It will be great to see you - and how many will you be? Two? Three?\"</p> <p>\"About 110!\" Cripes, it's the staff of our sister restaurant, Bibendum, no less. Oh God, not again, I thought, as the toe-curling feeling of dread that is the staff do came over me. Sadly, I was unable to protest too much, because when I had worked in the kitchens at Bibendum years back, we had hired Blue Print Cafe for our Christmas party.</p> <p>The fact that, this year, I would be cooking for them, rather than eating with them, was not an issue, although the irony of it all was not lost on me as I sighed deeply, thinking Auld Lang Synes aplenty. But the burning question was, what to cook? A New Year's Day celebration meal is rife with potential culinary potholes, not least because of the condition of the participants after partaking of the evening before. There is also the small matter of getting hold of ingredients at a time when just about everyone is shut. Your menu ideas must be laid down and then honed to a well-conceived whole that will please and restore simultaneously.</p> <p>So, to start, let's do puff pastry with plenty of porcini - mushrooms and pastry being a very good match. Even better, it can easily be made a little in advance.</p> <p>To follow, a great pot of spiced lamb comes to mind - a korma, that great braise that is as satisfying as it is delicious, accompanied by a dish of potatoes, cauliflower and spinach made fragrant with spice.</p> <p>As for the pudding, it took only the merest fraction of a second for me to suggest a trifle. The response was joyous. Quite right, too.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Jalousie des cepes</b><br></p> <p>Jalousie is French for a Venetian blind, and sounds a lot better than 'puff'.</p> <p><b> 100g dried c\u00e8pes </b><br><b>30g unsalted butter </b><br><b>6 shallots, finely chopped </b><br><b>4 cloves garlic, finely chopped </b><br><b>1 small glass white wine </b><br><b>30g flour </b><br><b>400ml milk </b><br><b>1 blade mace </b><br><b> 1 bayleaf </b><br><b> lemon, zest grated </b><br><b> 50g Parmesan, grated </b><br><b>1kg puff pastry </b><br><b>1 handful flat-leaf parsley, picked </b><br><b>2 fresh eggs, beaten </b><br><b>Sea salt and black pepper</b><br></p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Soak the dried mushrooms in enough tepid water to cover them, and leave to reconstitute for 20 minutes or so. Fry the shallots and garlic gently in the butter until softened. Infuse the milk with the mace and bayleaf. Squeeze the soaked c\u00e8pes of as much water as possible, then chop them up and fry until all trace of liquid has gone and they have darkened a little. Tip in the wine, cook until this liquid, too, has evaporated, then repeat the process with the strained c\u00e8pe soaking liquid. Stir in the flour, and cook gently for five minutes or so, until the whole has darkened somewhat. Pour a little of the infused milk through a sieve and into the pot, stir until the mixture is smooth, and repeat until all the milk is incorporated. Stir the sauce continuously until simmering, then for a further five minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and cover to prevent a skin from forming. Once it has cooled, add the lemon zest, Parmesan, parsley, all but a spoonful of the beaten eggs, salt and pepper. Leave to cool.</p> <p>In the meantime, prepare the pastry. Depending on the size of your oven and/or baking sheets, roll out two or three large rectangles of pastry and two or three smaller pieces. Lay the smaller pieces on the baking sheets, leaving plenty of space between each, and divide the c\u00e8pe filling equally among them. Spread the mixture over the pastry, leaving a 2.5cm border around the entire edge. On the remaining larger pastry rectangles, lightly mark out the perimeters of the stuffing, then cut across the sheet's breadth, making numerous incisions to emulate the slats of a Venetian blind. Brush a little beaten egg around the border of the pastry rectangle, then lay it on top of the smaller ones so that the slats sit comfortably on the stuffing, and press down to seal. Brush a little more beaten egg over the surface of the packages, and place in the fridge for an hour or so (though preferably overnight) before baking. Bake in the hot oven for five to seven minutes, then reduce the heat to 175C/350F/gas mark 4 for 15 minutes, then to 150C/300F/gas mark 2 for a further 15 minutes to ensure that the base is cooked. By this time, the jalousies should be puffed and golden atop. Serve warm.</p> <p><b>Lamb korma</b><br></p> <p>This beautiful dish is from Madhur Jaffrey, and is as pleasurable to prepare as it is to eat.<br></p> <p><b> 8 tbsp ground coriander </b><br><b>3 tbsp ground cumin </b><br><b>3 tbsp desiccated unsweetened coconut </b><br><b>12 onions </b><br><b>20 cloves garlic </b><br><b>4 thumb-size pieces fresh ginger </b><br><b>1 small tin plum tomatoes </b><br><b>2 tsp ground turmeric </b><br><b>Vegetable oil </b><br><b>12 whole cardamom pods </b><br><b>6 whole cloves </b><br><b>20 whole black peppercorns </b><br><b>4 bayleaves </b><br><b>1 whole cinnamon stick </b><br><b>3 dried hot chillies </b><br><b>4kg shoulder and leg of lamb (mixed, but get more neck as it is much tastier), cut into 2.5cm cubes </b><br><b>5 tbsp plain yoghurt </b><br><b>3 tsp salt </b><br><b>2 tsp garam masala</b> <br></p> <p>To finish</p> <p><b> 2 green chillies, sliced thin </b><br><b>2 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped</b> <br></p> <p>Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan and put in the coriander, cumin and coconut, stirring constantly to roast until coloured evenly. Put to one side. Peel and coarsely chop the onions, garlic and ginger, pop them in a liquidiser, along with the tomatoes, and whizz to a paste. Heat a big, heavy-based pot (or two), pour in three or so tablespoons of oil and wait until it begins to shimmer. Drop in the cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, turmeric, bayleaves, cinnamon and chillies, stirring all the while. Begin browning the meat in small batches. Place each batch in a bowl, and repeat until all the lamb is done. Tip the spices into the meat bowl along with the final batch.</p> <p>Add three to four tablespoons of oil to the pot, add the paste, keeping your face averted as it may spit alarmingly. Stir continuously while the paste thickens, then reduce the heat and add the merest splash of water to prevent it from scorching. Tip in the roasted spices, cook for another five minutes, then add the yoghurt a little at a time, stirring continuously. Return the meat to the pot, add salt and enough water barely to cover the lamb, cover tightly with a lid andgently simmer for an hour.</p> <p>Once the meat is tender, if the sauce is still very liquid, raise the heat and reduce carefully until it coats the lamb. Stir in the garam masala, cook for another five minutes or so, then remove any visible whole spices before serving, if desired.

Drain the vegetables and dry thoroughly.</p> <p>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot and pour in 10 tablespoons of oil. Tip in the fenugreek, fennel, cumin and chillies. Stir just once, then tip in the cauliflower and potatoes, stirring all the while to coat them in the spices. Reduce the heat, add the turmeric, coriander, salt and pepper, and fry gently for 10 minutes or so. Pour in the water, put a lid on the pot and cook gently for 10-15 minutes, until the vegetables are cooked but not collapsed. Shred the spinach and add to the pot, along with the garam masala, stirring them in carefully. Return the lid to the pot, and cook for a further five minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve hot.</p> <p><b>Trifle</b><br></p> <p>This year's favourite pudding is, apparently, trifle.

      "bodyText": "From a restaurateur's selfish point of view, I have a preference for New Year's Day over the New Year's Eve shindig, which revolves around seemingly ocean-sized quantities of alcohol. Sure, there is an undeniable thrill to be had from being out and about at the stroke of midnight, all wrapped up in great layers of woollens and other cosies, but I'm usually at work on New Year's Eve, so I have no qualms in putting those particular memories behind me. As luck would have it, an old pal phoned me a few weeks back and asked if he could come to the restaurant for lunch on New Year's Day. \"Of course - I'd be delighted! It will be great to see you - and how many will you be? Two? Three?\" \"About 110!\" Cripes, it's the staff of our sister restaurant, Bibendum, no less. Oh God, not again, I thought, as the toe-curling feeling of dread that is the staff do came over me. Sadly, I was unable to protest too much, because when I had worked in the kitchens at Bibendum years back, we had hired Blue Print Cafe for our Christmas party. The fact that, this year, I would be cooking for them, rather than eating with them, was not an issue, although the irony of it all was not lost on me as I sighed deeply, thinking Auld Lang Synes aplenty. But the burning question was, what to cook? A New Year's Day celebration meal is rife with potential culinary potholes, not least because of the condition of the participants after partaking of the evening before. There is also the small matter of getting hold of ingredients at a time when just about everyone is shut. Your menu ideas must be laid down and then honed to a well-conceived whole that will please and restore simultaneously. So, to start, let's do puff pastry with plenty of porcini - mushrooms and pastry being a very good match. Even better, it can easily be made a little in advance. To follow, a great pot of spiced lamb comes to mind - a korma, that great braise that is as satisfying as it is delicious, accompanied by a dish of potatoes, cauliflower and spinach made fragrant with spice. As for the pudding, it took only the merest fraction of a second for me to suggest a trifle. The response was joyous. Quite right, too. All recipes serve six. Jalousie des cepes Jalousie is French for a Venetian blind, and sounds a lot better than 'puff'. 100g dried c\u00e8pes 30g unsalted butter 6 shallots, finely chopped 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 small glass white wine 30g flour 400ml milk 1 blade mace 1 bayleaf lemon, zest grated 50g Parmesan, grated 1kg puff pastry 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, picked 2 fresh eggs, beaten Sea salt and black pepper Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Soak the dried mushrooms in enough tepid water to cover them, and leave to reconstitute for 20 minutes or so. Fry the shallots and garlic gently in the butter until softened. Infuse the milk with the mace and bayleaf. Squeeze the soaked c\u00e8pes of as much water as possible, then chop them up and fry until all trace of liquid has gone and they have darkened a little. Tip in the wine, cook until this liquid, too, has evaporated, then repeat the process with the strained c\u00e8pe soaking liquid. Stir in the flour, and cook gently for five minutes or so, until the whole has darkened somewhat. Pour a little of the infused milk through a sieve and into the pot, stir until the mixture is smooth, and repeat until all the milk is incorporated. Stir the sauce continuously until simmering, then for a further five minutes. Remove the sauce from the heat and cover to prevent a skin from forming. Once it has cooled, add the lemon zest, Parmesan, parsley, all but a spoonful of the beaten eggs, salt and pepper. Leave to cool. In the meantime, prepare the pastry. Depending on the size of your oven and/or baking sheets, roll out two or three large rectangles of pastry and two or three smaller pieces. Lay the smaller pieces on the baking sheets, leaving plenty of space between each, and divide the c\u00e8pe filling equally among them. Spread the mixture over the pastry, leaving a 2.5cm border around the entire edge. On the remaining larger pastry rectangles, lightly mark out the perimeters of the stuffing, then cut across the sheet's breadth, making numerous incisions to emulate the slats of a Venetian blind. Brush a little beaten egg around the border of the pastry rectangle, then lay it on top of the smaller ones so that the slats sit comfortably on the stuffing, and press down to seal. Brush a little more beaten egg over the surface of the packages, and place in the fridge for an hour or so (though preferably overnight) before baking. Bake in the hot oven for five to seven minutes, then reduce the heat to 175C/350F/gas mark 4 for 15 minutes, then to 150C/300F/gas mark 2 for a further 15 minutes to ensure that the base is cooked. By this time, the jalousies should be puffed and golden atop. Serve warm. Lamb korma This beautiful dish is from Madhur Jaffrey, and is as pleasurable to prepare as it is to eat. 8 tbsp ground coriander 3 tbsp ground cumin 3 tbsp desiccated unsweetened coconut 12 onions 20 cloves garlic 4 thumb-size pieces fresh ginger 1 small tin plum tomatoes 2 tsp ground turmeric Vegetable oil 12 whole cardamom pods 6 whole cloves 20 whole black peppercorns 4 bayleaves 1 whole cinnamon stick 3 dried hot chillies 4kg shoulder and leg of lamb (mixed, but get more neck as it is much tastier), cut into 2.5cm cubes 5 tbsp plain yoghurt 3 tsp salt 2 tsp garam masala To finish 2 green chillies, sliced thin 2 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped Heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan and put in the coriander, cumin and coconut, stirring constantly to roast until coloured evenly. Put to one side. Peel and coarsely chop the onions, garlic and ginger, pop them in a liquidiser, along with the tomatoes, and whizz to a paste. Heat a big, heavy-based pot (or two), pour in three or so tablespoons of oil and wait until it begins to shimmer. Drop in the cardamom, cloves, peppercorns, turmeric, bayleaves, cinnamon and chillies, stirring all the while. Begin browning the meat in small batches. Place each batch in a bowl, and repeat until all the lamb is done. Tip the spices into the meat bowl along with the final batch. Add three to four tablespoons of oil to the pot, add the paste, keeping your face averted as it may spit alarmingly. Stir continuously while the paste thickens, then reduce the heat and add the merest splash of water to prevent it from scorching. Tip in the roasted spices, cook for another five minutes, then add the yoghurt a little at a time, stirring continuously. Return the meat to the pot, add salt and enough water barely to cover the lamb, cover tightly with a lid andgently simmer for an hour. Once the meat is tender, if the sauce is still very liquid, raise the heat and reduce carefully until it coats the lamb. Stir in the garam masala, cook for another five minutes or so, then remove any visible whole spices before serving, if desired. Sprinkle with chillies and coriander and serve with plain boiled rice and the following vegetable dish. Potatoes and cauliflower, fennel seeds and spinach A fantastic combination. 4 medium cauliflowers 1kg waxy potatoes 10 tbsp vegetable oil (or ghee) tsp fenugreek seeds 3 tsp fennel seeds 4 tsp whole cumin seeds 2 whole red dried chillies 1 tsp ground turmeric 4 tsp ground coriander seeds 3 tsp salt Plenty of black pepper 200ml cold water 300g spinach 2 tsp garam masala Break the cauliflower into florets and place in a bowl of cold water for half an hour. Peel the potatoes and cut into 2cm squares. Rinse the potato thoroughly, then leave to soak in cold water for half an hour also. Drain the vegetables and dry thoroughly. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot and pour in 10 tablespoons of oil. Tip in the fenugreek, fennel, cumin and chillies. Stir just once, then tip in the cauliflower and potatoes, stirring all the while to coat them in the spices. Reduce the heat, add the turmeric, coriander, salt and pepper, and fry gently for 10 minutes or so. Pour in the water, put a lid on the pot and cook gently for 10-15 minutes, until the vegetables are cooked but not collapsed. Shred the spinach and add to the pot, along with the garam masala, stirring them in carefully. Return the lid to the pot, and cook for a further five minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve hot. Trifle This year's favourite pudding is, apparently, trifle. It just goes to show that you cannot keep a good pudding down. For the everlasting syllabub 250ml white wine 5 tbsp brandy 2 lemons, juiced and rind pared 80g caster sugar 750ml double cream For the trifle 2 vanilla pods tsp freshly grated nutmeg 1.3 litres whipping cream 8 fresh eggs 3 tbsp caster sugar 1 2.5cm deep by 16cm wide sponge Apricot jam 24 macaroons 70ml good white wine 70ml madeira 30g whole almonds, roasted Crystallised fruits First, prepare the syllabub. Put the wine, brandy, lemon juice and rind into a bowl, cover and leave overnight. Strain the liquid, dissolve the sugar therein, then slowly whisk in the cream until thickened and cloud-like. Split the vanilla pods, scrape out the seeds, and add the pods, seeds and nutmeg to the whipping cream in a saucepan. Place the pot over a high heat. Whisk together the eggs and sugar, stir in a little of the infused cream, and tip the lot into the cream in the pot. Stir the custard over a gentle heat until it thickens and a bubble appears on the surface. Remove from the heat, and pour through a sieve into a wide bowl, to extract the vanilla pod and any lumps. Leave to cool. Slice the sponge through the middle, spread each half with apricot jam and cut into smaller pieces. In a big bowl, place the sponge pieces with the macaroons, then pour over the wine and madeira. Pour in the custard, cover and put in the fridge for an hour or so. Spoon the syllabub on top and scatter with whole almonds. Cut the crystallised fruit into shards and scatter among the almonds. Chill thoroughly, preferably overnight, before serving \u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.",

      "body": "<p>Before they have been published, and through the glorious filter of the catalogue or press release, all books sound fascinating. A skilfully constructed editor's blurb, like a good foundation garment, can disguise flabbiness and impart shape; a glamorous author photograph or seductive strapline can momentarily distract from a hackneyed idea or far-fetched plotline. The contemplation of next year's vast crop of books, then, is a tricky affair, and some of the books featured in this sneak preview may well turn out to be dodos. Nonetheless, much of what is coming our way in 2001 does sound tempting - and here is a brief survey of those volumes most likely to charm the money out of your wallet. </p> <p>Arguably, fiction is the area most prone to \"proof of the pudding\" syndrome: past form is not a failsafe guide to future performance, and hyped first novels yield as many cringing disappointments as they do exciting discoveries. Next year, apart from the seasoned campaigners mentioned opposite, veteran authors Anita Brookner, Bernice Rubens, Russell Hoban and Margaret Drabble all publish new work, but perhaps the most eagerly awaited appearance will be from V S Naipaul, whose new and as yet untitled novel will come out in September. For my money, though, Iain Sinclair's first novel for eight years is well worth looking out for: set in a valley bordering England and Wales rather than Sinclair's home turf of London and peopled by conspiracy theorists, utopians and lunatics, it sounds characteristically extraordinary. <strong> Landor's Tower </strong> will be published by Granta in March at \u00a315.99. </p> <p>In a completely different vein, one pudding I have already tasted is Laurie Graham's <strong> The Future Homemakers of America </strong> (June, Fourth Estate, \u00a39.99). It's delicious. Graham is a peculiarly overlooked novelist, despite her surefire comic touch and wayward invention. Her last novel was set in an East End sink estate; her new offering whisks us off to the Fens, where a group of US Airforce wives are grimly sitting out their post-war postings. Occasionally compared to Alan Bennett, Graham exhibits precisely the same blend of toughness and sentiment, and deserves a far greater measure of recognition. </p> <p>Among the highlights of imported fiction, a new novel from Marie Darrieussecq continues her obsession with fractured lives. Her last, My Phantom Husband , revolved around an abrupt disappearance; <strong> Breathing Underwater </strong> (May, Faber, \u00a39.99) also features a protagonist who simply ups sticks. More unpredictable comings and goings are at the heart of Haruki Murakami's <strong> Sputnik Sweetheart </strong> (May, Harvill, \u00a312): his tale of frustrated teachers will doubtless please his growing number of British fans. </p> <p>In the world of non-fiction, biography and history continue to prove themselves publishing's most fertile ground: alongside those mentioned opposite, lives of Lutyens, David Trimble, Maria Callas, Gwen John and James Miranda Barry will all grapple for coverage. One of the most intriguing subjects is Richard Dadd, the fantastical fairy-painter who, in a fit of delusion, murdered his father. Patricia Allderidge examines his life - much of it spent in an asylum - in <strong> The Parricide's Story </strong> (July, Cape, \u00a318.99). Andrew Hussey's <strong> The Game of War </strong> (June, Cape, \u00a318.99) sees another odd bloke getting the treatment - this time situationist, soixante-huitard and suicide Guy Debord. </p> <p>History tends to divide neatly into \"big picture\" books - the panoramic views of the Schamas, Fergusons and Cannadines - and the exact opposite: episodic and faintly quirky works of \"narrative non-fiction\" spawned by Longitude . In the second camp, this season boasts <strong> Selkirk's Island </strong> by Diana Souhami (Weidenfeld, May, \u00a320), about the real-life Robinson Crusoe, and Sarah Bakewell's <strong> The Smart </strong> (April, Chatto, \u00a317.99), a slice of life that provides more evidence of the apparently inexhaustible appeal of 18th-century London. </p> <p>Quirkiness is not confined to the historical; a distinct sub-genre in sports writing has emerged in which whimsy is a prerequisite. Books of famous men writing about their enthusiasms - in this case Al Alvarez in <strong> Poker </strong> (March, Bloomsbury, \u00a320) and Mordecai Richler in <strong> On Snooker </strong> (April, Yellow Jersey, \u00a310) - serve the dual purpose of conferring gravitas and excitement on the pastime in question and reminding us that writers are not boring recluses with limited experience of vibrant popular culture. It doesn't always work, but might in these distinguished cases. </p> <p>Many - if not most - books don't fit into discrete categories, which is why writers often complain of having come across their work in the travel, humour or erotica sections of inept bookshops. The most eye-catching of the odds and ends include Adam Phillips's <strong> Houdini's Box </strong> (April, Faber, \u00a39.99), in which the eclectic psychotherapist examines escapologists - not just the self-proclaimed kind like Houdini, but more subtle cases of a little girl obsessed with hide and seek, poet Emily Dickinson and an analysand preoccupied with flight. Meanwhile, Stanley Williams really did escape - from an erupting volcano that engulfed his companions. His horrifying story is told in <strong> Surviving Galeras </strong> (April, Little, Brown, \u00a316.99). And finally, one for the paranoid: <strong> Crypto </strong> by Steven Levy (January, Allen Lane, \u00a318.99) preys on all our anxieties about the digital age. It also boasts a supremely inventive subtitle - \"Keepers of Secrecy, Warriors of Privacy and Celebrants of Anarchy in the New Code War\".

An industrious bee wings past <br></p> <p>Towards its buzzing labours. Blackbirds hop <br></p> <p>From worm to worm. I stretch my idleness <br></p> <p>And drop a book I tried but failed to read. <br></p> <p>A hedgehog waddles down the weeded <br></p> <p>path. <br></p> <p>A chaffinch, perched on a propped rake, <br></p> <p>chirps, <br></p> <p>Then vanishes within my blink. <br></p> <p>I have a bird in one eye and a trout <br></p> <p>For my supper. I'm talking to myself <br></p> <p>In my garden of indolence where I grow <br></p> <p>Lethargy, lilies, and sit breathing mint, <br></p> <p>Rosemary, thyme, sage, thinking of how <br></p> <p>I'll cook <br></p> <p>That fine fat fish I caught in a mad moment <br></p> <p>Devoted to dexterity and doing. <br></p> <p>The breeze riffles the dropped <br></p> <p>unreadable book. <br></p> <p>Shall I have chips with it, or baby potatoes? <br></p> <p>Salad? Green beans? Or asparagus <br></p> <p>spears? <br></p> <p>At this rate I'll be mentally exhausted <br></p> <p>Before it's time to cook and eat.

Kick the book. <br></p> <p>That's the stuff! Boot it away. I'll leave it <br></p> <p>Out here on the grass. I won't improve it. <br></p> <p>All this is my property!

      "bodyText": "The pleasure's one of its anticipation Knowing what will happen, when, where, though why - For all my pondering - rarely gets answered. It's the pleasure of expectedness, Of the light breeze, birdsong, well-gardened air, And vapour zips in the timetabled sky. It's quite unexceptional, perfect peace In a domesticity of one, civilian To the point of irenic stasis, slothful To a fault. An industrious bee wings past Towards its buzzing labours. Blackbirds hop From worm to worm. I stretch my idleness And drop a book I tried but failed to read. A hedgehog waddles down the weeded path. A chaffinch, perched on a propped rake, chirps, Then vanishes within my blink. I have a bird in one eye and a trout For my supper. I'm talking to myself In my garden of indolence where I grow Lethargy, lilies, and sit breathing mint, Rosemary, thyme, sage, thinking of how I'll cook That fine fat fish I caught in a mad moment Devoted to dexterity and doing. The breeze riffles the dropped unreadable book. Shall I have chips with it, or baby potatoes? Salad? Green beans? Or asparagus spears? At this rate I'll be mentally exhausted Before it's time to cook and eat. Aha! I could have deep-fried bad book ... Thank God For chairs, cushions, blue sky, and peace and quiet. I so much looked forward to my day off. Now that it's here, what I looked forward to, I realise, was doing damn all in a deckchair. Thank God, too, for this Chablis, black olives, Sunshine, and all these fragile butterflies, Busy, beautiful, and living their lives As if there's no tomorrow. Kick the book. That's the stuff! Boot it away. I'll leave it Out here on the grass. I won't improve it. All this is my property! My goods and chattels, Impedimenta, my but-and ben, mine own Estate and little home, and all for me ... Another airliner - high energy, Sky-power, propulsion, and momentum, Exactly what I'm doing without today By being bum-bound on a comfy chair. Can't I get off my butt and do something? Well, no - frankly. It's my day off, my first In weeks. I've done enough. It's time to do Nothing, for controlled irresponsibility. I'm relaxing. The bird in my right eye Fidgets. Sun does funny things to the leaves. Hedgehog's back! Is it a he or a she? It goes past me like a self-propelled handbag. I need to pee. But if I go inside I'll be tempted to stay. Well, it's my grass, And there's no one about ... So here goes water. Deeply, I regret having pissed on the book. Much worse, though, is I think I've doused a daisy Which didn't deserve it. One day, I might invent A board or card game, but for one player - It won't be called 'solitaire'. I'll call it 'Time on My Side', or else 'As I Like It'. I'm lying low, but coming up for air. My wandering mind patrols its boundaries. There are some things I like better than this - A walk along a beach on Bernaray, Laughing with Lillias in the summer-house I can't yet bring myself to call a 'gazebo'. Or dozing in Vienna over coffee. And other things, equally innocent ... Some might be physical. Not one means 'work'. \u0095 From The Year's Afternoon by Douglas Dunn.

And is our preference for tobacco and alcohol over heroin and cocaine just a cultural accident, different societies making different choices about which drugs are embraced and which demonised? These are questions that Ciaran Regan, a professor of pharmacology at University College Dublin, raises yet never properly answers in an intriguing historical survey of Homo sapiens's long relationship with mind-altering substances. </p> <p>Regan offers up many quirky facts about drug use. The fly agaric mushroom, with its classic red cap and white spots, has probably been producing hot flushes and visions since prehistoric times. It is so prized by modern Siberian tribespeople that one mushroom can cost three reindeer. Luckily for the impecunious, the drug can be recycled by drinking the urine of the original purchaser. The active ingredient, ibotenic acid, remains potent for four or five such \"passes\". </p> <p>In medieval times, flying ointments were prepared from mandrake and deadly nightshade, which contain drugs that block the brain neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. When rubbed into the armpit or rectum - areas of skin with a rich blood supply - the user falls into a deep sleep with strange dreams of soaring. Cannabis was introduced to Europe by Napoleon's army returning from Egypt. In the form of a confection called dawamesc - hemp tops ground up with sugar, orange juice, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, musk, pistachios and pine kernels (now there's a Christmas bon bon!) - it was handed around at Le Club des Hachichins, a notorious gathering place for decadents, including the poet Charles Baudelaire. </p> <p>Regan does a good job of sketching the full range of drug use, tracing the emergence of all the familiar drugs and showing how cultures often stumble upon their own local variants on a theme. So tobacco was being chewed throughout the Americas for at least the past 5,000 years. For a similar time - judging by the red-stained teeth of skeletons - people have been chewing betel nut in south east Asia, while Africans had their own nicotine equivalent in khat leaves and the Australian Aborigines chewed pituri, the extract of a shrub. </p> <p>Regan also offers thumbnail sketches of the relative hazards of various drugs and the way they affect the brain. Alcohol operates by the remarkably unsubtle mechanism of inserting itself into the thin membrane walls of brain cells, dulling their ability to fire. In the early stages of inebriation, certain types of brain cell or parts of the brain are more affected than others. The feeling is good because the pathways disrupted happen to be ones to do with feelings of anxiety and inhibition, so we develop that warm, sociable glow. But at higher doses, all brain activity begins to slur and we become just blind stumbling drunk. </p> <p>While the action of alcohol may present little challenge to the pharmacologist, cannabis, surprisingly, is probably the least understood drug. More than 60 psychoactive ingredients have so far been identified, and it is only very recently that researchers discovered the brain has a particular receptor for one of these molecules. That is, the brain uses a cannabis-like neurotransmitter for its own internal signalling purposes. But no one yet knows why stimulating this obscure receptor should produce a cocktail of psychological effects that include euphoria, hunger and talkativeness. </p> <p>As for the hazards of drug use, Regan's basic line seems to be that all drugs are poisons and none is much better or worse than others if used with moderation. Instead, what seems remarkable is the way cultures swing to extremes of opinion about a particular substance. Tobacco or marijuana? Alcohol or cocaine? On a pharmacological cost-benefit analysis, often these drugs come out much the same, but public attitudes are always polarised. Coffee and chocolate once caused moral panic, yet the Victorians were happy to swig opium and alcohol in the form of laudanum. And they used cocaine in every form from teething drops for infants to a drink, Vin Maraini, that carried the Pope's seal of approval. All societies have had their drugs, and historical accident has apparently decided which become the socially acceptable ones. </p> <p>So what is the \"scientific\" view on human drug use? Regan is rather taken by the possibility that Homo sapiens evolved to be a substance abuser: we have been using drugs for so long that we have become genetically adapted to them. Indeed, they may serve an evolutionarily important, mind-expanding purpose. Unfortunately, he supports this radical suggestion with only a few speculations about a puzzling adult taste for bitter, mildly stimulating brews and evidence that Europeans have extra liver enzymes for eliminating alcohol, the possible legacy of centuries of heavy boozing. More convincing data will be needed before anyone can take his voguish hypothesis too seriously. </p> <p>A clearer scientific message is an anthropological observation. In history, drugs have seemed a good thing when they are used as part of a ritual, communion or other bonding activities - when the use is a social rather than an individual act. This is how we instinctively draw the moral boundaries. Drugs that promote sociability become revered, while those that isolate are treated as profoundly dangerous. However, despite setting the scene for a sharp examination of how and whether we should use consciousness-altering drugs, Regan's book tails away into the anodyne. Rather than pursue the moral argument, he rambles off on to a description of the drugs used to treat mental illness and eventually even a potted history of the field of pharmacology. An opportunity missed. </p> <p> \u0095 John McCrone writes about the science of consciousness at <a href=\"http://www.btinternet.com/~neuronaut/\"> www.btinternet.com/~neuronaut/</a></p>",

Shall it be a page a day, or a page a week? Desk or pocket? Filofax or electronic organiser? Which of these egregious little modernisms will we use to chart our course through another year? How shall we write our lives? And when shall we visit the dentist? </p> <p>At the beginning of a year the diary expresses optimism. At the end it's a record of defeats. Re-read your own diary for 2000 and remind yourself of what it is you've already lost: friends, places, meetings. Time. All those little dead nows, the husks of our inner lives. The diary announces great and sad news: the old self is dead. But here, upspringing, comes something new. </p> <p>If I consult my own old diaries, my past appears as mysterious to me as my future. Where was \"DINNER?\" on Wednesday February 9? Was I really in Ireland for two weeks in April that year? Why? And on February 12 1999, did I overhear this: \"Yes, I'd like to make an appointment please. It's about my ears. I was wearing these dangly earrings, and the wire cut through my lobes\"? Or did I make it up? Even a recent entry, for Monday December 11 2000, already makes no sense: \"Piss hot.\" What? </p> <p>The diary is the place where our outer lives take shape, the point at which the biographical meets the structural, where we compose our narrative. There are therefore several basic requirements for any successful diary. First, there must be enough room to record appointments. This rules out <strong> The 2001 Dodo Pad</strong>, a diary which seems to have been designed for people with tiny handwriting, or tiny hands. People, apparently, like Emma Thompson, Julian Critchley, and the Hon Lady Shuckburgh, all of whom appear to swear by the Dodo. If these names alone are not enough to put you off, then the \"very British and timeless sense of humour featured throughout the diary\" probably will. Any diary which exhorts you to doodle is taking its whimsy too seriously. </p> <p>Diaries are supposed to set the tone and tempo for the year, and since the tempo of modern life, as Norbert Elias once so elegantly put it, is \"nothing other than the mani festation of the multitude of intertwining chains of interdependence which run though every single social function people have to perform, and of the competitive pressure permeating this densely populated network\", then the very least one should expect is for a diary to take its responsibilities seriously. <strong> The Times Literary Supplement Diary 2001 </strong> measures up to the challenge, being one of those long, severe pocket books far too big for most pockets, unless you have a tame Savile Row tailor. It will be useful if you ever find yourself without the telephone number for, say, Princeton University Press, or the address of the literary periodical Novoye Literaturnoye Obozreniye. TLS working days are divided into hours from 8 till 6, and weekends are left free. With a nasty logo embossed in silver on its leathery cover, it might easily be mistaken for a promotional giveaway from a road-haulage company. </p> <p>There's no mistaking the <strong> Waterstone's Diary 2001</strong>. It announces itself as the \"ideal practical present for any book lover\", although at \u00a37.99 one suspects that most book-lovers would prefer an actual book, grainy photographs and pieces from Philip Gross, Mich\u00e8le Roberts and Ben Okri being hardly sufficient to satisfy all but the most dilatory of readers. At the other end of the scale is the <strong> British Library Literary Engagement Diary 2001</strong>, so stuffed full with calligraphy and holograph reproductions as to wither all but the boldest hand. Do you really want to jot down your dentist's appointment alongside the original manuscript of Sylvia Plath's \"Insomniac\"? </p> <p>It is sometimes lamented that there are no great diarists any more - that our lives, paced as they are by telephones and television and emails, do not allow for the opinions and distensions of a Pepys, a Klemperer, or even a young Alan Bennett. And it's true, the diary for most of us is not the place to record our innermost thoughts and convictions, or even our evenings out with Stephen Daldry and Dame Thora Hird, but rather to remind us what time we need to collect the children. Most of us don't have time to feel nostalgic for our own emotions, or to dwell for too long upon the imagined horrors of the moment. </p> <p>There may be no great diarists, then, but there are still great diaries. By far the best is the legendary <strong> Redstone Diary</strong>, the thinking man's Pirelli calendar. Now in its 11th year, it comes themed and edited by Julian Rothenstein and Mel Gooding. 2001 is \"Odysseys and Other Journeys\". Waterstone's may have a specially commissioned poem by Carol Ann Duffy, but here we find an \"Application Form For a Kingdom of Heaven Passport\", Richard Long's \"Spring Walk\", photographs of Che Guevara in disguise, the room in the Baykonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, in which Yuri Gagarin spent the night before he travelled into space, and a stamped certificate of a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella. The typography is neat and unobtrusive, the dates are clear, and the sturdy ring-binding allows you to tear out the nice pictures when you've finished. </p> <p>In the midst of one's self-obsessions, the Redstone Diary reminds one of other worlds. And who knows, maybe this year will be the year when you no longer merely imagine another life for yourself, but decide to live it instead. Actually, in the diary of my other life I've just woken up and taken my beautiful children down to the Lower East Side to buy Nova Scotia salmon and cream cheese and pumpernickel bagels at Tannenbaum's. Plans for the retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art are coming along fine, and I've finally booked an appointment for that cosmetic dentistry. We really must meet for lunch, or a drink. No, seriously. Have you got your diary? </p> <p>\u0095 The 2001 Redstone Diary is available from Redstone Press at \u00a310.95.</p>",

There may be no great diarists, then, but there are still great diaries. By far the best is the legendary Redstone Diary, the thinking man's Pirelli calendar. Now in its 11th year, it comes themed and edited by Julian Rothenstein and Mel Gooding. 2001 is \"Odysseys and Other Journeys\". Waterstone's may have a specially commissioned poem by Carol Ann Duffy, but here we find an \"Application Form For a Kingdom of Heaven Passport\", Richard Long's \"Spring Walk\", photographs of Che Guevara in disguise, the room in the Baykonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, in which Yuri Gagarin spent the night before he travelled into space, and a stamped certificate of a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella. The typography is neat and unobtrusive, the dates are clear, and the sturdy ring-binding allows you to tear out the nice pictures when you've finished. In the midst of one's self-obsessions, the Redstone Diary reminds one of other worlds. And who knows, maybe this year will be the year when you no longer merely imagine another life for yourself, but decide to live it instead. Actually, in the diary of my other life I've just woken up and taken my beautiful children down to the Lower East Side to buy Nova Scotia salmon and cream cheese and pumpernickel bagels at Tannenbaum's. Plans for the retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art are coming along fine, and I've finally booked an appointment for that cosmetic dentistry. We really must meet for lunch, or a drink. No, seriously. Have you got your diary? \u0095 The 2001 Redstone Diary is available from Redstone Press at \u00a310.95.",

Chandler is generally more forthcoming about the cat, until after his wife's death, when he writes sentimentally and movingly about her.

The only loosening occurs with a late botched suicide attempt, the result of depression after his wife's death. </p> <p>Chandler, like most writers, was a griper, and the moans are standard - publishers' inability to publish properly, covers, meddling copy editors unsplitting intentionally split infinitives, photos, agents, reviews (absence of or unfavourable: \"While reviewing generally is not very reliable anywhere, I really do think English reviewing is getting absurd\").

Like Fitzgerald, Chandler, despite his hard-boiled props, wrote principally about loss: check those titles - The Long Goodbye, The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely. And like Fitzgerald, and many others of his literary generation, he suffered from the writer's main occupational hazard, drink. He was reduced to writing - pulps, then private-eye fiction - because of drink, having been fired from the oil business in his forties.

A natural restlessness translated into frequent moves - more than 100 addresses in all - until he ended up in La Jolla outside San Diego. Chandler, who was of Irish Quaker extraction and had been poshly educated at Dulwich, was rather down on California, which he found shallow, in his letters at any rate; there are few hints here of the fertile landscape of his fiction. </p> <p>His observations tend to rely on the sort of general disgruntlement which is the writer/drunk's off-duty state.

      "body": "<p><strong>Melancholy corners of a foreign field</strong> </p> <p> December 22 2000 </p> <p> Dawn on the road to Folkestone with my daughter. We're driving via the Channel tunnel towards Bauvais, south of<br> Amiens, about 50km to the north of Paris, to a house that we have rented with three other families. The radio is<br> percolating away with the Today programme, which is shorn of politics because it's Christmas, and because \"politics\" in<br> Britain is apparently synonymous with parliamentary sessions and the availability and willingness of politicians to submit<br> to interviews. So a zoologist is talking about his study of the way penguins conserve their energy when they walk.</p> <p> It's<br> possible, he says, that penguins will be able to give advice to pregnant women. Or is it the other way round? Male<br> penguins sit on their eggs for months, without moving or eating, while their partners roam freely. \"It'll never catch on<br> with humans,\" says my daughter. <br> I grew up in a house with few books; one of them (or to be more precise two of them) was The Times History of the<br> Great War. Appropriately enough, the volumes were as large as tombstones and at least as melancholy. The books<br> strove for a diffident and unemotional style but the story that the maps, photographs and statistics told to a curious<br> 10-year-old was a terrible litany of misery. They didn't show the victims of gas attacks or of shell-shock - those mad<br> eyes, robbed of their souls came to haunt me later - but fuzzy photographs of lozenge-shaped tanks lurching over<br> muddy crests, battalions marching to and from the front, groups of soldiers relaxing (\"Indian soldiers enjoy a<br> cigarette\") and line after regimented line of corpses marked by crosses were enough to fill my imagination. </p> <p> <strong> December 23</strong><br> <br> It's a sharp, clear day as we drive through the small villages and towns whose names conjure my childhood memories of<br> houses and churches crumble like pie-crust by the war: Armentier\u008fs, Bapaume, Bethune, Douai, Cambrai, Arras, Vimy -<br> where there's a memorial to 60,000 Canadian soldiers who died defending a small lip of land that projects above a plain<br> that used to be dotted with coal mines. The memorial consists of two tall rectangular columns of Portland stone, with<br> the names of the dead soldiers inscribed around the base while a hooded weeping woman gazes out from the ridge. </p> <p>It's<br> very simple and expressive and extraordinarily moving but less so than the trenches that have been preserved nearby.<br> The Canadian and German lines that faced each other are perhaps only 30m apart at their closest. Between the<br> opposing trenches, massive craters have been left by constant bombardment as if gouged out by giant hands, while the<br> land all around them is pitted and puckered. It's all grassed over now like a thin membrane over a virulent pox. On this<br> beautiful, cold, sunny day my daughter and I are able to see each other all too clearly across the trenches: close enough<br> to see a smile or a tear. </p> <p> <strong> December 24</strong><br> <br> There's a thick, almost impenetrable fog and as we enter the Somme region, small handwritten signs announce perhaps<br> the most memorable characteristic of the region (at least for the soldiers): boue - mud. Every minor road is smeared<br> with thick clay, which sticks to our shoes as we step towards a monument near a small village called Azincourt. Henry<br> V's battlefield is marked with a menhir and a plan showing the disposition of the troops. The nimble English archers<br> hiding in the woods achieved victory over the French knights, who were obliged to fight on foot because of the<br> waterlogged fields and were bogged down in the mud in their heavy armour. <br> We think of the 20th century as the era that invented mass barbarity and suffering, in which whole societies were<br> culled by war, but 10,000 Frenchmen died at the battle of Agincourt.</p> <p> The battlefield is known as La Carogne - the<br> Carrion, a name which might justly apply to the whole of this region in which war cemeteries are as common as orchards<br> in the Vale of Evesham. The stoical jocularity of the \"tommy\" is achingly immortalised in a British cemetery called<br> Blighty Valley, but alongside almost every small road there seems to be a corner of a foreign field that is forever<br> England, or Scotland, or Wales, Ireland, Canada, Australia, India, Africa, Morocco, even Germany, whose cemeteries<br> announce themselves more discreetly and whose dead are marked by plain black crosses. </p> <p> Through a veil of mist and thin rain we spot the British memorial to the Unknown Soldiers. It's an appropriately<br> monumental monument designed by Lutyens in the imperial manner that he developed for the government buildings in<br> New Delhi.

      "bodyText": "Melancholy corners of a foreign field December 22 2000 Dawn on the road to Folkestone with my daughter. We're driving via the Channel tunnel towards Bauvais, south of Amiens, about 50km to the north of Paris, to a house that we have rented with three other families. The radio is percolating away with the Today programme, which is shorn of politics because it's Christmas, and because \"politics\" in Britain is apparently synonymous with parliamentary sessions and the availability and willingness of politicians to submit to interviews. So a zoologist is talking about his study of the way penguins conserve their energy when they walk. It's possible, he says, that penguins will be able to give advice to pregnant women. Or is it the other way round? Male penguins sit on their eggs for months, without moving or eating, while their partners roam freely. \"It'll never catch on with humans,\" says my daughter. I grew up in a house with few books; one of them (or to be more precise two of them) was The Times History of the Great War. Appropriately enough, the volumes were as large as tombstones and at least as melancholy. The books strove for a diffident and unemotional style but the story that the maps, photographs and statistics told to a curious 10-year-old was a terrible litany of misery. They didn't show the victims of gas attacks or of shell-shock - those mad eyes, robbed of their souls came to haunt me later - but fuzzy photographs of lozenge-shaped tanks lurching over muddy crests, battalions marching to and from the front, groups of soldiers relaxing (\"Indian soldiers enjoy a cigarette\") and line after regimented line of corpses marked by crosses were enough to fill my imagination. December 23 It's a sharp, clear day as we drive through the small villages and towns whose names conjure my childhood memories of houses and churches crumble like pie-crust by the war: Armentier\u008fs, Bapaume, Bethune, Douai, Cambrai, Arras, Vimy - where there's a memorial to 60,000 Canadian soldiers who died defending a small lip of land that projects above a plain that used to be dotted with coal mines. The memorial consists of two tall rectangular columns of Portland stone, with the names of the dead soldiers inscribed around the base while a hooded weeping woman gazes out from the ridge. It's very simple and expressive and extraordinarily moving but less so than the trenches that have been preserved nearby. The Canadian and German lines that faced each other are perhaps only 30m apart at their closest. Between the opposing trenches, massive craters have been left by constant bombardment as if gouged out by giant hands, while the land all around them is pitted and puckered. It's all grassed over now like a thin membrane over a virulent pox. On this beautiful, cold, sunny day my daughter and I are able to see each other all too clearly across the trenches: close enough to see a smile or a tear. December 24 There's a thick, almost impenetrable fog and as we enter the Somme region, small handwritten signs announce perhaps the most memorable characteristic of the region (at least for the soldiers): boue - mud. Every minor road is smeared with thick clay, which sticks to our shoes as we step towards a monument near a small village called Azincourt. Henry V's battlefield is marked with a menhir and a plan showing the disposition of the troops. The nimble English archers hiding in the woods achieved victory over the French knights, who were obliged to fight on foot because of the waterlogged fields and were bogged down in the mud in their heavy armour. We think of the 20th century as the era that invented mass barbarity and suffering, in which whole societies were culled by war, but 10,000 Frenchmen died at the battle of Agincourt. The battlefield is known as La Carogne - the Carrion, a name which might justly apply to the whole of this region in which war cemeteries are as common as orchards in the Vale of Evesham. The stoical jocularity of the \"tommy\" is achingly immortalised in a British cemetery called Blighty Valley, but alongside almost every small road there seems to be a corner of a foreign field that is forever England, or Scotland, or Wales, Ireland, Canada, Australia, India, Africa, Morocco, even Germany, whose cemeteries announce themselves more discreetly and whose dead are marked by plain black crosses. Through a veil of mist and thin rain we spot the British memorial to the Unknown Soldiers. It's an appropriately monumental monument designed by Lutyens in the imperial manner that he developed for the government buildings in New Delhi. A vast brick-built four-sided triumphal arch towers over a stone catafalque bearing the names of 73,000 men who went missing in action. Crowned With the Sunshine of Immortal Youth, says the inscription with appalling irony. Lines of tombstones, the dead on parade, mark the presence of what was left of bodies that could only be identified by the regimental flashes on their uniforms: \"Soldier of the Great War/Known Unto God\". On the monument are the names of missing members of the bicycle battalion. In this cold, this fog, this wet - even today we slip and sludge through the perfectly manicured lawns - this seems to sum up the entire lunacy; in lanes impassable to lorries, tanks, armoured cars and even horses, a bicycle seems as much use as a teacup in a forest fire. They say there is no condition one adapts to so quickly as war, a lesson that's been learned the hard way by the nearby village of Thiepval, which was destroyed twice in the first war and fought over in the second. But like all the other villages and towns we have passed through, its face is resolutely cheery - Christmas decorations in the streets, Santas scaling the walls of the low houses. I'm an unembarrassed Francophile of the sort brilliantly documented by Posy Simmonds: I like the language (though I don't speak it well), the oysters in the market, the expert butchers, the choice of cheeses, the sense of place and civic pride, boules in the town squares under the plane trees, poplars by the roadsides, the architecture (up to about 1910), much of the landscape and many of the people. I like too the fact that most small towns have Maisons de la Culture, and that in a smallish town like Amiens the alternative to The Grinch and The Muppet Christmas Movie is a choice of 12 Chinese films. If there is evidence of a permanent conquest in this much fought-over part of France, it is in the McDonald's signs which are displayed on the outskirts of every town, the huge carpet, furniture, DIY and wine warehouses, and the nightmarishly gigantic hypermarkets.

The Millennium Commission has contributed \u00a350m to this hugely popular London attraction. </p> <p>Pointedly perhaps, the presence of guests was not required at the Dome in Greenwich, for which the Millennium Commission has dug much deeper into the pockets of its lounge suits. Yet, in visitor numbers alone, the Tate, a modern art gallery, beat the dome, an incomprehensible theme park, hands down. </p> <p>Not that there was anything particularly wrong with the design of the dome itself. Yes, it's an old-fashioned, Dan Dare-style homage by the Richard Rogers Partnership to those twin architectural icons of the 1951 Festival of Britain, Ralph Tubb's Dome of Discovery and Powell and Moya's Skylon. Yes, it's also a rather likable rogue, especially by night. Nancy Banks-Smith, the Guardian's TV critic, described it as looking like a stranded jellyfish. </p> <p>The trouble with the dome - the huge sums of money wasted on the content aside - was the lack of a single good idea, the smell of burgers that wafted inside and out, the vicious and churlish behaviour of the politicians responsible for it, especially during the lead-up to its opening, the stink over its financing and management, and the frightful row over its future. </p> <p>Disturbingly, the year's other major architectural project connected directly to those who like having power over us was the bloated and ugly Portcullis House, by Michael Hopkins and Partners. This visual assault stands slap-bang opposite Barry and Pugin's fairytale Palace of Westminster. </p> <p>It's a shame that so much effort, money and aggressive energy was wasted on the dome, especially as the doomed-from-the-start Millennium Experience was to set the political and cultural tone for the officially designated millennium year. It cast a deep nimbus cloud over so many fascinating and truly worthwhile projects that were funded by the Millennium Commission, one of several discretionary bodies under Chris Smith's wing. </p> <p>Back to the pre-Christmas Tate Modern bash. The invitation was a brave attempt to blow that cloud away. It listed in bold type the achievements of the Millennium Commission... \"A million trees, eight new bridges, 100 new visitor attractions, 550 village halls and centres, 8,500 miles of paths and cycleways... almost 2,000 new open green spaces, a million books to 4,500 state schools... 600 churches with new bells.\" Add to these the equally impressive lists that could be typed up by the Heritage Lottery and Arts Council Lottery commissions and it's clear that the sin of the dome has been redeemed in all but the press and the popular imagination. </p> <p>Without doubt there have been some very good millennium-related buildings. The conversion of the former Bankside power station into Tate Modern by the Swiss architects Herzog and de Meuron is a magnificent achievement, if a little too cool for some tastes. </p> <p>There's the hugely impressive Great Court at the British Museum designed by Foster and Partners, and the handsome, castle keep-like Walsall Art Gallery by Caruso St John (their first major building and a critical triumph). In Lancaster, there's the romantic Ruskin library by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard. </p> <p>In West Sussex the Millennium Seed Bank, for the Royal Botanic Gardens' outpost at Wakehurst Place, is a fine building by Stanton Williams and a superb learning experience. The American Air Force museum at Duxford is Foster at his best again, aided and abetted by a dangerously beautiful collection of US warbirds flocked around a B-52 nuclear bomber. There's Foster, a third time, with the Great Glass House at the National Botanical Garden of Wales. </p> <p>Others not to miss are the Peckham library by Alsop and Stormer, the London Eye by David Marks and Julia Barfield, the Wellcome Wing at London's Science Museum by MacCormac Jamieson Prichard, and the extraordinary Eden Project in Cornwall by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners. These hi-tech bubbles that appear to blow from a disused clay quarry look intriguing; we'll have to wait until next year to see if all the fuss has been worth it. Let's hope so. </p> <p>There are buildings that don't exist but ought to by now - if the millennium suits had wanted it. I miss Zaha Hadid's opera house on Cardiff bay, even though it never left the drawing board or computer screen. It would have looked great; the project was scuppered by the Millennium Commission. I would like to have seen Daniel Libeskind and Cecil Balmond's amazing Spiral gallery, all fractals and wired-up geometric energy, completed and open at the V&amp;A. Fortunately, Libeskind's Imperial War Museum, Salford is well on its way on the opposite side of the Manchester Ship Canal from Michael Wilford's busy new Lowry Centre. </p> <p>There are plenty of other buildings I wish didn't exist. Throughout the year, British architects of another breed have been busy littering the country with a staggering number of trashy shopping malls, call centres, distribution depots, business parks, shiny offices and executive housing. Yes, we have seen some fine new buildings of which we can all be proud this year, yet these are outweighed by the junk that we somehow insist on as our right. </p> <p>Equally we have watched the infrastructure of these traffic-coned isles slip and slide away into disorder. If only we could have invested some of those millennium billions into our railways and our hospitals as well as our museums and parks. Imagine if we had new main-line stations and other transport buildings designed by the likes of those who have graced our museums and art galleries. </p> <p>The year did see, however, the completion of the last of the great publicly funded and publicly run transport infrastructure projects we'll see for many years: the Jubilee line extension of the London Underground between Green Park and Stratford via North Greenwich. Under the inspired and tireless architectural direction of Roland Paoletti, one amazing station has followed another. The line has become a tourist attraction in its own right. It is a truly great achievement; the sheer scale of some of the lonelier stations, such as Canada Water, suggesting future development around them in what, in parts, are still very poor areas of London. </p> <p>At the same time, the principal gateways to London from overseas - with the honourable exceptions of Waterloo and Paddington stations, both beneficiaries of the design skills of Nicholas Grimshaw - remain pretty embarrassing experiences. Think Heathrow, think Gatwick, think Stansted (a fine Foster building being quickly trashed), and think the stink of horrid food. The millennium would have been a good opportunity to invest in a clear-up of these latter-day Augean stables. </p> <p>On a smaller scale, two of my own best architectural investments this year have been the new edition of Norbert Schoenauer's peerless 6,000 Years of Housing (WW Norton), and the first English translation of Hermann Kern's Through the Labyrinth (Prestel). This is less a rainy afternoon book than one that could see you through a flood: a good year, then, to publish this masterly study of labyrinths and their relation to religion and architecture.</p>",

On a smaller scale, two of my own best architectural investments this year have been the new edition of Norbert Schoenauer's peerless 6,000 Years of Housing (WW Norton), and the first English translation of Hermann Kern's Through the Labyrinth (Prestel). This is less a rainy afternoon book than one that could see you through a flood: a good year, then, to publish this masterly study of labyrinths and their relation to religion and architecture.",

There's no disguising the fact there are some vile and unpleasant people in the members' club.\" </p> <p>After the deaths of two Leeds United supporters in Istanbul eight months ago, it is clear that the English hooligan element sees Turkey as the new enemy. But what is perhaps most disturbing is the number of teenagers, aged 16 to 19, who have become involved. </p> <p>\"We have just had France 98 and Euro 2000 which have both been quite easy for young people to get to,\" says Thomas. \"You don't see the BNP [British National Party] or Combat 18 openly organising racism but there is definitely a new generation coming through, as the game in the Stade de France showed.\" </p> <p>John Tongue, a Bury supporter and club member since its formation, recalls England's World Cup qualifier against Italy at Wembley in 1997. \"I went with three friends and afterwards two of them said they would never watch England again,\" he says. </p> <p>\"One of the distasteful things about watching England is that is there is always a percentage of racists. There is a certain level of xenophobia, rubbish like No Surrender to the IRA and all that dross, but what surprised me most that night was that we were sitting in a section designated for the members' section. Judging by some of the remarks we heard, it did not seem to make any difference whatsoever.\" </p> <p>According to Mark Perryman, a Tottenham Hotspur fan who has followed England abroad since 1996, it is \"too simplistic\" to say the main problem is racism. \"The problem is xenophobia rather than racism. There are people who follow England and refuse to accept anything foreign. But that's not just a football problem. You will see that on the Costa del Sol with English tourists every summer. </p> <p>\"The report is right to say there is a hardcore of racist and violent people in the members' club but there are also the best, most passionate supporters in the country and the government will get nowhere if it fails to realise that.\" </p> <p>Ministers are proposing stricter implementation of laws against racist and sexist remarks at matches and there are plans to encourage a more family-oriented environment by employing accredited stewards to travel with the official members' organisation. </p> <p>The report was set up in the wake of violence involving English supporters at Euro 2000 and it suggests that a revamped club would require the existing 27,000 members to be vetted again. Anyone with a criminal conviction would be barred sine die. </p> <p>Thomas says the jury remains out on the government's proposals. \"A revamp is necessary but it will need a package of measures. There are all sort of things to be weighed up and that will mean a long hard struggle.\" </p> <p>Until then, England's away matches will continue to be engulfed by a dread of what may or may not happen off the pitch.</p>",

But what is perhaps most disturbing is the number of teenagers, aged 16 to 19, who have become involved. \"We have just had France 98 and Euro 2000 which have both been quite easy for young people to get to,\" says Thomas. \"You don't see the BNP [British National Party] or Combat 18 openly organising racism but there is definitely a new generation coming through, as the game in the Stade de France showed.\" John Tongue, a Bury supporter and club member since its formation, recalls England's World Cup qualifier against Italy at Wembley in 1997. \"I went with three friends and afterwards two of them said they would never watch England again,\" he says. \"One of the distasteful things about watching England is that is there is always a percentage of racists. There is a certain level of xenophobia, rubbish like No Surrender to the IRA and all that dross, but what surprised me most that night was that we were sitting in a section designated for the members' section. Judging by some of the remarks we heard, it did not seem to make any difference whatsoever.\" According to Mark Perryman, a Tottenham Hotspur fan who has followed England abroad since 1996, it is \"too simplistic\" to say the main problem is racism. \"The problem is xenophobia rather than racism. There are people who follow England and refuse to accept anything foreign. But that's not just a football problem. You will see that on the Costa del Sol with English tourists every summer. \"The report is right to say there is a hardcore of racist and violent people in the members' club but there are also the best, most passionate supporters in the country and the government will get nowhere if it fails to realise that.\" Ministers are proposing stricter implementation of laws against racist and sexist remarks at matches and there are plans to encourage a more family-oriented environment by employing accredited stewards to travel with the official members' organisation. The report was set up in the wake of violence involving English supporters at Euro 2000 and it suggests that a revamped club would require the existing 27,000 members to be vetted again. Anyone with a criminal conviction would be barred sine die. Thomas says the jury remains out on the government's proposals. \"A revamp is necessary but it will need a package of measures. There are all sort of things to be weighed up and that will mean a long hard struggle.\" Until then, England's away matches will continue to be engulfed by a dread of what may or may not happen off the pitch.",

      "bodyText": "Ars\u00e8ne Wenger must be putting it mildly when he describes his visit to Sunderland on the opening day of the season as \"a nightmare\". Arsenal lost, Patrick Vieira was sent off and Wenger was involved in a tunnel incident with the fourth official that landed him a 12-game touchline ban he is still trying to overturn. When Sunderland Part II hits Highbury today, Wenger will hope for an afternoon less eventful and more successful. As he says, not much more could have gone wrong at the Stadium of Light and this is a match Arsenal need to win. \"It's as simple as that.\" Not just to pursue Manchester United but to keep Sunderland, one place behind in third, off their backs. The chances of avoiding more rising on-pitch temperatures may be helped by the fact that Darren Williams is likely to be on Sunderland's bench. He was elbowed by Vieira as he tried to haul the French man back, seemed to be accused by Arsenal players of cheating and was said by Wenger to have been close to a serious post-match incident with Thierry Henry in the tunnel. Not that Arsenal's manager expects Sunderland to arrive intent on goading Vieira. \"I never go into a game with suspicious ideas about anything,\" he said. \"I just try to see my team doing well and I can't imagine Sunderland will come down and just try to wind up Patrick. That would not be fair.

In the average feature, it's barely enough time for the golden stars to revolve round the peak of Paramount mountain. But 60 seconds to get in and out - that's tight.

Stop For a Minute is a series of shorts commissioned by Dazed and Confused magazine together with FilmFour Lab, made by an eclectic bunch of directors, artists, designers, et al. The diversity is extraordinary. I've sat through enough shorts programmes at festivals to know that, given five, 10, 12 minutes, people more often than not end up doing much the same thing. But give them 60 seconds, and the possibilities seem endless - animation, portraiture, essays, documentaries, frozen moments. And invariably, whether it's explicit or not, the minute itself becomes the subject. </p> <p>Michael Stipe recites all the things you can do in 60 seconds.

Some feel as if they're over as soon as you've registered them - not so much Stop For a Minute as Blink and You'll Miss It. With others, you can feel every second passing - and for once, that's by no means a bad thing. Some films cram in as many cuts as possible, while others take the minute as an unbroken stretch. </p> <p>Roman Coppola folds his minute in two in a witty reverse-time gag. Breda Beban crams her entire life story into a single shot of the palm of her hand.

Others work a single striking image or technique: in Alnoor Dewshi's witty Shush, three speakers' faces are digitally mutated to make an unsettling commentary on language and lies. </p> <p>My minute - which premieres online on January 12 - is a gag, a man-goes-to-the-doctor joke done in a single shot that lasts exactly 60 seconds from the first word to the last image.

The Stainless Steel Rat by Harry Harrison</strong><br>Harry Harrison's work spans the whole of SF: comedy, hard SF, fantasy, you name it. All of it is worth reading. The Stainless Steel Rat series is not, on the whole, laugh-out-loud comedy, but it is funny. If you haven't tried any, ignore the gaudy covers and buy one. They're all good. Then read Captive Universe which is not a comedy book, but it will make you go out and buy the rest of his work.</p> <p><strong>3. Discworld by Terry Pratchett</strong><br>There are dozens of books in the Discworld series. Technically, they're science fantasy, involving dragons and other mythical creatures. If you're a fantasy fan, Mr Pratchett certainly delivers a good laugh consistently. If you haven't read any of them yet, where have you been?</p> <p><strong>4. A Scanner Darkly by Philip K Dick</strong><br>Mr Dick's work has been the source of a number of major movies: Blade Runner and Total Recall among them. A Scanner Darkly is a bizarre and often hysterically funny novel about an undercover drugs cop who finds himself on his own trail. Compulsory.<br><strong><br>5. Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut Jr</strong><br>A unique and original talent, Mr Vonnegut dislikes being pigeon-holed as an SF writer. The fact remains, though, that he's responsible for a lot of classic and extremely funny writing in this genre. Slaughterhouse Five is his masterpiece, and it veers from incredibly funny to as black as it gets, centred as it is around the firebombing of Dresden (at which the young author was present). Once you've read it, you'll want to rush out and buy Breakfast of Champions and Player Piano and Cat's Cradle and ... well, everything else he's written.<br><strong><br>6. Venus On The Half-Shell by Kilgore Trout</strong><br>A curiosity, this one. Kilgore Trout is a fictional science fiction writer invented by Kurt Vonnegut jr, who often used him as a way of making personal appearances in his own novels. However this book was written by Philip Jose Farmer, using Vonnegut's alter-ego character as a nom-de-plume, to break him out of a writer's block. Interesting.<br><strong><br>7. Riverworld by Philip Jose Farmer</strong><br>Again, not out-and-out comedy. The whole of humankind finds itself reincarnated on the banks of an enormous river. It's a big concept, spanning several volumes, and tremendous fun, the main heroes being the author's own favourite historical personages, including Tom Mix (the early cowboy movie actor in the 10 gallon hat), Mark Twain and a bizarrely reformed Herman Goering. Don't miss it. The series begins with To Your Scattered Bodies Go and ends with The Dark Design.</p> <p><strong>8. Ringworld by Larry Niven</strong><br>Once again, not a drop dead funny comedy, but great, original characters and fantastic concepts with a wry sense of fun. A must-read. The sequel's just as good, too.</p> <p><strong>9. Colony by Rob Grant</strong><br>All right, I've caved in. But then how can I provide a definitive top 10 without including this sparkling gem of the genre?</p> <p><strong>10. Backwards by Rob Grant</strong><br>Outrageously, I've mentioned myself twice.
