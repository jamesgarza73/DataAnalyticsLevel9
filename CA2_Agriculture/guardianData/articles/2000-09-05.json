Uefa yesterday insisted that City must play the second leg of their Uefa Cup first-round tie against Red Star Belgrade in the troubled Balkan state on September 28, the clear inference being that refusal to do so would result in expulsion from the competition. John Elsom, the Leicester chairman, and the Football Association's chief executive David Davies will meet senior Uefa officials in Geneva this morning to try to reverse the decision. The Foreign Office has warned that it would be \"inadvisable\" to go on the specified date as it falls four days after an election, and on the day when results are due to be announced. \"Our advice is that tension is likely to rise in Serbia and Montenegro in the run-up to those elections,\" said a spokesman. The Birmingham City manager Trevor Francis has confirmed that he is trying to bring Paul Kitson, the out-of-favour West Ham striker, to St Andrews. Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest have been charged with misconduct by the FA after players of both sides reacted violently to a late penalty award when the teams met on August 28.",

Then on 81 minutes the veteran forward completed a personal double with a far-post header from a Greening cross, to the delight of a 67,447 crowd. When Beckham added the icing on the cake with a 20-yard bobbling shot, the roar might have been heard at empty Maine Road.",

      "body": "<p>It's a weekday, it's gone six and you feel the tough times have been had. But the day isn't over yet. Still on the cards is that compulsory evening trip to the pub. Sounds appealing - but there's a catch. What lies in wait is an evening consisting not of merriment, but of work. </p> <p>The trend to move work into a new arena has made ground in recent years, engulfing bars as well as eateries in the affluent business economy. Sometimes enjoyable, sometimes masquerading as so, our working hours are being stretched ever further by week night drinking. The thinking behind an after hours pint with your workmates and clients is, of course, that it works wonders for the company. </p> <p>Geoff Lowe, a health psychologist at Hull University, has researched the social benefits of sneaking in the odd beverage. \"We've been looking at what it is people get up to when they drink, and one of the things is that there is always laughter. In social drinking there's usually plenty of laughter and relaxation, which is a lot better for your work and health than the tension, pressure, bitterness and back-biting that everyone's used to these days.\" </p> <p>Pubs and bars can level the playing field, iron out the sometimes rigid structure of the office. It is a situation where personalities shine through, hierarchies are quashed and where office politics comes a dull second to the welcoming sight of a hard-earned pint. \"It does kind of change the atmosphere,\" says Bridget Hogg, an occupational psychologist. \"Once you get to know each other in a social environment it brings you to a different level at work. There tends to be a bit more empathy back in the office, and you get deeper working relationships as a result.\" </p> <p>As a workplace strategy or policy it's unlikely to be cast in stone, but office drinks organised by the powers-that-be will undoubtedly have an ulterior motive. Andrew Sampson, an account manager at a London advertising company, relays a recent instance when he was virtually forced out of the office and into the pub with his colleagues. \"We were all put on a project together where we were supposed to be mentoring new recruits around the firm. Then somebody realised that hardly any of the mentors knew each other, so before we started working on anything we all got sent out for a drink together.\" The drink was harmless enough, but the fact that it encroached on his own time, he admits, \"was a bit of a pain\". </p> <p>UBS Warburg is another company that rates the practice. Jeff Lubin, the managing director of European high yield, boasts that taking his team out for food and drinks is \"conducive to breeding trust and loyalty\". </p> <p>Even those who spend their working days surrounded by booze don't rule out the value of a good drink in a social setting. Peter Richnell, the owner of the Havelock Tavern in Olympia, recently took his staff on a day out to the beach \"to get plastered and have a good time\". </p> <p>\"I don't set out to make them interact and play games to sort out their differences, they just do it,\" he says. \"I don't know whether it's because of the trips, but it does help people get on more and I do tend to have quite a loyal set of staff for someone in the pub business.\" </p> <p>It is Britain's renowned pub culture that leaves us somewhat out on a limb compared to the drinking habits of the rest of Europe. Penny Brown, a neuroscientist who worked in Germany for a year, describes how she barely socialised with colleagues outside her lab. \"It's not like being in England,\" she says, \"It's not that the Germans were unfriendly but nobody ever suggested we go out. And the one time we did go to a bar together they thought we drank a hell of a lot. During the week they'd be more inclined to have one drink which would last them all evening. They save the heavy drinking for their festivals where they completely let their hair down and go the other way.\" </p> <p>Foreign nationals based in the UK find our imbibing habits equally perplexing. Christian Lengelle is a Frenchman who works at Credit Lyonnais in London. \"It's a different culture over here. French people are just not used to drinking so much after work.\" He argues that, while British partners are accepting of the late nights that follow an evening's drinks with colleagues and clients, French relationships are not so forgiving. \"French expats will say they just can't do it. They won't even try to negotiate with their wives.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, he has grown to welcome this little nuance of British working culture with open arms. \"It's more of a casual way of doing business. You can lose the shirt and tie and it all becomes a bit more entertaining. I quite like it like that.\" As do the many other city dwellers who make their way to the hundreds of accommodating bars and pubs that continue to spring up around our working establishments. All of which leaves the non-drinker feeling like a bit of a party pooper if they're always left saying no to an after hours quickie. </p> <p>\"In some situations where work people are expected to go out drinking there's that element of pressure to look out for,\" says Lowe. \"You'll find people start getting concerned that if they don't go they'll miss something, or that the others might be talking about them. So there's the negative aspects to drinking as well.\" </p> <p>All of which rings true for teetotaller Mark Solon, who gave up drinking in moral support of his wife when she became pregnant. As a result he experiences \"a little frisson when clients ask for a gin and tonic and I have to order a mineral water\". Likewise, he was left out during his legal training firm's annual outing to Dublin. When the rest of the staff left at 11pm for their big night out, Solon said his goodbyes and went to bed. \"I missed out because I wasn't part of that drinking attitude any more,\" he says. \"I suppose the ultimate effect of stopping drinking is you're excluded from the stories and therefore excluded from the group.\" When asked about his drinking plans after the birth of his child, Solon admits that it is likely to be the end of his nine-month fast. \"A strong drink will probably be in order.\" </p> <p>But as Lowe points out, the benefits of drinking with your work pals are not unconditionally attached to guzzling the odd pint or short. \"The social aspects add up to more than the alcohol itself. If the socialisation can only occur in the context of drinking well, that's better than nothing. But people can be out with their workmates, have a lemonade and reap all the benefits without even risking a hangover.\"</p>",

But I would have thought that there are sexual, economic, educational possibilities undreamt of in the early 1900s. Against that Charlotte Jones's play, first seen at the Bush last year, somewhat conservatively argues that women's lives are still defined by masculine needs and desires. </p> <p>Philosophically, her play is reactionary; formally, however, it is extremely bright and inventive. In common with other women writers such as Caryl Churchill and Kate Atkinson, Jones juxtaposes different periods. In the present we see Alex, a 36-year-old cartographer, coping with an Alzheimer's-afflicted mother, a difficult flatmate and a selfish, married lover. Meanwhile, in 1908 Yorkshire, Alex's ancestors have a similarly strenuous time: the simple-minded Clara and the oppressed Livvy live with their stonily severe Gramma, and are seduced by an itinerant photographer. </p> <p>Doubling of the roles reinforces the parallels between past and present. Kerry Fox's map-making Alex admittedly enjoys a careerist freedom denied her forbears. But Marcia Warren and Rosie Cavaliero appear in both eras as women variously denied fulfilment and the same two male actors, Jason Hughes and Ivan Kaye, embody ineffectual romanticism and heartless seduction. Jones seems to be saying that women today face greater choices but are still the victims of masculine weakness or egotism: it may have a grain of truth but it accords women a passivity and helplessness which I don't encounter. </p> <p>The odd thing is that the determinist message conceals an extremely sparky and engaging style. Alex's relationship with her querulous, bedridden mum, who is a closet tapdancer, is beautifully observed. Her plumply neurotic flatmate, Clootie, who believes she only gets work as a waitress because she makes people feel better about ordering pudding, is richly funny. And Jones reveals a gift for the bizarre that enables her to show a fake-Italian photographer at a Yorkshire fair seducing Livvy by doing a bird of paradise fantasy dance. </p> <p>Anna Mackmin's production makes the transition from the Bush with commendable ease. Kerry Fox endows the apprehensive Alex with the right mix of outer toughness and inner insecurity. Marcia Warren switches brilliantly between her basilisk mother and the vinegary Yorkshire Gramma. And Rosie Cavaliero is a real find as the retarded Clara and the contemporary Clootie. </p> <p>Undeniably Jones possesses a quirkily original theatrical talent. But I would find her play even more enjoyable if it offered a less fatalistic view of women as perennial victims of male inconstancy. </p> <p> This review appeared in later editions of yesterday's paper. </p>",

Meanwhile, in 1908 Yorkshire, Alex's ancestors have a similarly strenuous time: the simple-minded Clara and the oppressed Livvy live with their stonily severe Gramma, and are seduced by an itinerant photographer. Doubling of the roles reinforces the parallels between past and present. Kerry Fox's map-making Alex admittedly enjoys a careerist freedom denied her forbears. But Marcia Warren and Rosie Cavaliero appear in both eras as women variously denied fulfilment and the same two male actors, Jason Hughes and Ivan Kaye, embody ineffectual romanticism and heartless seduction. Jones seems to be saying that women today face greater choices but are still the victims of masculine weakness or egotism: it may have a grain of truth but it accords women a passivity and helplessness which I don't encounter. The odd thing is that the determinist message conceals an extremely sparky and engaging style. Alex's relationship with her querulous, bedridden mum, who is a closet tapdancer, is beautifully observed. Her plumply neurotic flatmate, Clootie, who believes she only gets work as a waitress because she makes people feel better about ordering pudding, is richly funny. And Jones reveals a gift for the bizarre that enables her to show a fake-Italian photographer at a Yorkshire fair seducing Livvy by doing a bird of paradise fantasy dance. Anna Mackmin's production makes the transition from the Bush with commendable ease. Kerry Fox endows the apprehensive Alex with the right mix of outer toughness and inner insecurity. Marcia Warren switches brilliantly between her basilisk mother and the vinegary Yorkshire Gramma. And Rosie Cavaliero is a real find as the retarded Clara and the contemporary Clootie. Undeniably Jones possesses a quirkily original theatrical talent. But I would find her play even more enjoyable if it offered a less fatalistic view of women as perennial victims of male inconstancy.

He has done real missionary work for the operas, rehabilitating The Fiery Angel, Betrothal in the Monastery and most recently Semyon Kotko. While the symphonies, especially the Fifth, don't require that kind of proselytising, there's no doubt that his performances give the music a weight and conviction that confounds most criticism. He was assisted greatly here by the playing of the Rotterdam orchestra; they had seemed a first-rate orchestra in Parsifal the previous evening under Rattle, and here they attacked the symphony with real intensity, surging through the great string tunes with a rich depth of tone, touching in the woodwind detail that adds an acidulated edge to the climaxes with withering precision. </p> <p>Most of the feeling of Soviet-inspired hack work that is hard to escape in this symphony was blown away by Gergiev's utter seriousness. Even the balletic scherzo took on an edge of menace, while the coda to the first movement was loaded with dark forebodings. In the finale the tension was ratcheted up to an almost unbearable extent. This may still have been Prokofiev putting an optimistic face on the horrors of war, but in this performance there was no escaping the hints of the tragedy that would well up in the Sixth Symphony, composed immediately afterwards. </p> <p>There had been more Russian music at the start of the concert: the little Reverie that was Scriabin's second orchestral piece, and which already, in 1898, was looking forward to the endless sinuous melody and untethered harmonies of his more grandiose works. The orchestra floated perfectly. Gergiev also provided pungent support to the soloist Jean-Yves Thibaudet in Grieg's Piano Concerto, whose performance was full of big, bold gestures and flamboyant bravura - the old warhorse was dusted down and given a coat of high-gloss varnish. </p>",

The misanthropic whole is summed up by Ron O'Donnell's brilliant painting featuring a man bedecked in tartan, sitting in a room decorated with the memorabilia of plastic patriotism.

It is hard to find anyone - unless they are employed by Holyrood - who has a kind word to say about the new Scottish political institutions. If there is any feeling at all for the parliament on the streets, it is the one neatly summarised by Billy Connolly who calls it a \"wee pretendy parliament\". Yet for some observers, the very fact Scotland at last has a parliament to sneer at is a major step forward.</p> <p>\"We may have a mess now with all this summer's cock-ups,\" says Andrew Jaspan, \"but at least it's Scotland's mess. For years it's been easy to say it's someone else's fault. Now people have to face up to it. And I think that's brilliant.\"</p> <p>Jaspan points to the debate about Section 28 as a perfect example of what he calls a \"growing-up process\" instigated by the arrival of the parliament. The debate was an ugly, divisive one. The bus billionaire Brian Souter bankrolled a campaign against its abolition which quickly ran out of control. Posters suggested that if Section 28 was removed from the statute books, buggery would become part of the syllabus. With the willing endorsement of the Catholic church and parts of the Church of Scotland, the anti-abolitionists whipped up a virulently homophobic fervour.</p> <p>\"A lot of people said that the debate over Section 28 was a disaster,\" says Jaspan, \"but I reckon it was probably the best debate Scotland's had for years. It challenged a lot of people who assumed we were a tolerant, liberal society to really look at themselves and defend the issues.\"</p> <p>Gordon Macdougall, the political editor of Scottish Television, agrees.</p> <p>\"A lot of my English friends told me that the Section 28 business showed what a backward, ugly nation we really were,\" he says. \"But at the end of it, Section 28 has been abolished up here and it is still on the statute books down south.\"</p> <p>For all its symbolic importance, however, Section 28 was still, in essence, an intellectual issue. When it comes to the nitty-gritty of finance, health, housing and education, the parliament does not yet appear to have proved that it can run things better than Westminster.</p> <p>\"A year is too soon to tell,\" says Frank McAveety. \"But I believe we are putting in place legislation which, in the long run, will change Scotland for the better. I think people had such high hopes of immediate change, there is inevitably a sense of anti-climax, but legislation takes time. I'm relaxed about the slagging off. It is a legitimate job of the press to examine. And you could say it's that good for the first time they really have something to examine.\"</p> <p>It would help, some observers feel, if the parliament could get its own PR right. Not just stopping blunders such as its self-important first day in office, but being much more active in explaining to voters just what it is up to. But in the meantime, for the first time in Scotland's parliamentary history, the boys and girls returning to Holyrood for the new term tomorrow have to face up to this issue: a summer of relentless bad news has got to be resolved not at 400 miles distance, but by them, on their fellow citizens' doorstep.</p> <p>\"It is the big question: can the Scots govern themselves? and we shall have to wait for the answer,\" says Gavin Stamp. \"Mind you, population of less than five million, edge of Europe, crap climate: the Norwegians seem to manage it.\"</p>",

The decision follows repeated assurances from Dome organisers the New Millennium Experience Company that it would not seek any more funds from the commission. In making the extra money available, the commission said it was \"deeply disappointed\" to be in a position to have to offer a further grant - which makes the 'cost' per visitor \u00a3125 if the predicted seven million tourists turn out before the end of the year. It has also been announced that the Dome will have a new executive chairman in businessman David James, who is taking over from the current non-executive chairman, David Quarmby. This does not affect the position of chief executive PY Gerbeau. The commission said today that the latest application from Dome organisers the New Millennium Experience Company followed an external review of NMEC's financial position. \"The review has confirmed the commissions' concern that there are serious failing in NMEC's financial management,\" said the commission in a statement tonight. It went on: \"It is now estimated that in order to remain open until the end of the year, to facilitate the agreed deal with (new owners) Dome Europe and achieve a solvent liquidation, a further \u00a347 million is required.\" The decision to make the further grant followed a two-hour meeting today of Millennium Commissioners chaired by Culture Secretary Chris Smith. The grant follows one of \u00a360 million made in February when Dome chief executive Jennie Page resigned and another of \u00a329 million in May when Dome chairman Bob Ayling stood down. Then, in August, the commission announced the Dome would be getting a \u00a343 million advance payment from the sale of the Dome at the end of the year to a consortium backed by Japanese finance group Nomura. The statement continued: \"In considering the application, the commission has had to recognise that without extra grant, the NMEC would have gone into immediate liquidation and the Dome would have had to close. \"Outstanding creditors, including many small businesses, would have gone unpaid, around 2,000 jobs would have been lost, and thousands of people who have already booked would have been unable to visit.\" The commission said that in agreeing to make the extra cash available, it had imposed a number of conditions, in particular relating to the reorganisation of NMEC's financial management. It added that with immediate affect, a senior management team was being set up, headed by Mr James. \"This team has clear instructions to take what steps it can to reduce as far as possible the final call on lottery funds,\" said the commission. It went on: \"The commission is deeply disappointed to find itself in the position of having to make a further grant of \u00a347 million to NMEC.\" The Minister in charge of the Dome, Lord Falconer, said it would have been more expensive to close the attraction early than to provide the extra cash announced today. That, he explained, had been the view of the independent accountants who had looked at the figures. \"Of course it is very, very regrettable but in terms of the public interest it is the right course to take,\" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Lord Falconer said to close the Dome would jeopardise the \u00a3800 million regeneration money which had been promised to Greenwich.

But sometimes you may want to complain about your experience. If you do, this is when the world of student experience collides with the world of university administration. And it is not a pretty sight.</p> <p> Postgraduate research students often have particularly bad experiences due to the nature of their supervisory relationships, inherent isolation and the length of their study. Often postgraduates feel disempowered in the academic community and reliant on not rocking the boat, since they feel this may threaten the successful completion of their research. But it is much more damaging to keep quiet and let problems compound over time. If you do complain, then the situation is anything but clear. </p> <p> Complaints procedures in universities are in a mess. There are two aspects here: internal and external procedures. Internal mechanisms for dealing with complaints are being improved now. The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAAHE) launched a Code of Practice for dealing with internal complaints in May this year (available at <a href=\"http://www.qaa.ac.uk/\"> http://www.qaa.ac. uk/</a>). But external mechanisms are often archaic, confusing and unfair. </p> <p> If you ask what the system is for external complaints, there are two answers. Older universities set up under royal charter are bound by decisions of the visitor, an external and arguably independent person whose authority on dispute resolution is upheld by the courts. New universities are subject to judicial review separately through the courts. Why two systems? Historical accident and a certain arrogance by some universities that the system was working and didn't need changing. It wasn't and it does. </p> <p> If your university is governed by the visitorial system, who are these \"visitors\"? They include the Queen and various other royals, the archbishops of Canterbury and York and a selection of lords and earls. But don't expect a visit from the Queen if you want to complain about your supervision. These cases will be dealt with by the Privy Council Office or the Lord Chancellor's Department in Whitehall. Visitors very rarely visit a university and have been known to pass judgment on cases simply by writing to students and telling them that their case has been rejected with no explanation. </p> <p>Don't expect the system to be fast, either. Some cases last years without resolution. It is not surprising that students who have been forced to deal with some university complaints procedures have strong views such as: \"Though universities don't have universal grievance procedures, they do seem to have a cynically consistent protocol for stitching up 'strident' students.\" In a National Postgraduate Committee survey on student complaints in 1998, when institutions were asked if they had a complaints procedure, 34% said no. When asked why, one university responded that it didn't need a complaints procedure because it never received any complaints. </p> <p> So surely the solution is for universities to change their procedures? But only the government can alter the visitorial system, through legislation. Unfortunately there was no will to do this until May this year, when higher education minister Baroness Blackstone acknowledged that \"it is time for a modern, open, transparent system\". This was surprising since, in the same month, the Department for Education and Employment was saying that the government had no plans for change. </p> <p>So why the change of heart? This probably has something to do with the forthcoming Human Rights Act, which comes into force on October 2. Universities and the government have a certain incentive now to reform the system to avoid unnecessary expense, if not severe embarrassment. So how should student complaints be managed? The Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals has proposed various alternatives in recent years from arbitration to independent review panels.</p> <p> However, opinion now seems to be swinging firmly in favour of a single system for all UK universities in the form of a national ombudsman. Coincidentally, the NPC and the National Union of Students have been calling for such a solution for years. Owain James, NUS president, says: \"Students are now consumers. In no other sector would you pay for a service and not expect to have the option of complaining if the quality was not up to scratch.\" New legislation to establish an ombudsman for higher education would be a positive move to eradicate the archaic and anachronistic practices infesting the sector. Universities must face up to their responsibilities to students and deal with complaints effectively and fairly. </p> <p> Even if change was agreed this would not protect students immediately. But there are some things you can do to avoid ever having to deal with complaints mechanisms. The best solution is to deal with problems as soon as they arise at as low a level as possible. Be honest with yourself and with staff such as your supervisor. If you are having problems with your supervisor, speak to the head of department, someone in the postgraduate office or at the students' union. Be sure to keep records of your meetings with staff and supervisors, what was agreed, and write out regular progress updates for yourself. If things do go wrong this will provide strong evidence to support your complaint.</p> <p> Whatever you do, don't hide from the problems. They won't go away and might get much worse. If you deal with things quickly you can move on positively. There is finally light at the end of the tunnel and signs of radical reform to sweep away the ancient and inept procedures that universities have clung to for so long. More important than the procedures themselves is the need for a significant shift in attitudes. Universities and their staff should welcome and encourage comments at all levels and bring an open and non-judgmental attitude to complaints. </p> <p>Adopting a defensive and overly formal stance from the outset causes frustration and animosity and encourages confrontation. Complaints are something to learn from to improve services and practices. And that is something we can all hope for, whether students, staff or administrators.

Universities would gradually build up a fund, each worth about \u00a31bn, and the income generated would be used to phase out the current grants. The universities would not be allowed to touch the capital, but they would be allowed to use the interest \"to make whatever financial arrangements they like.\" Where would the money come from?

How would the Tory plans change the present system? The money would replace the hundreds of millions of pounds that the state provides each year through the Higher Education Funding Council (HEFC). What are current funding levels? In 1999-2000, the council was responsible for around \u00a34.22bn.

      "body": "<p>Towards the end of last term, the deputy head of one Hackney comprehensive went to greet one of her growing number of supply teachers. She was surprised to find a frail 80-year-old slumped in a chair, and even more surprised to see that the pupils had taken pity on the chap - they spent most of the rest of the day looking after him.</p> <p> Later the same day, at the same school, another supply teacher walked out of the classroom after complaining that her unruly pupils did not show her the respect she deserved, while a third was spotted, feet up on the desk, reading the papers while his pupils ran riot around him. </p> <p>Thousands of children will return to school this week without a permanent teacher at the front of the classroom, as record numbers of staff jobs remain unfilled in an unprecedented recruitment crisis. Although the problem is widespread - affecting tiny rural primary schools as well as sprawling inner-city comprehensives - the shortage is most serious in London. New figures to be published next month will show record vacancies in the capital of 1,020 - the highest figure ever. </p> <p>The problem is not new, and it shows no sign of abating: as the number of vacancies rises, the number of trainees plummets. Some schools have now become reliant on supply teachers - pupils in one inner-city secondary were taught by 13 different maths teachers in the course of a year. And they may be the lucky ones: a few schools have been unable to reopen at all, or have been forced to send pupils home early because of staff shortages, creating unexpected childcare problems for parents. </p> <p>For parents whose children come home to report that they have only a temporary teacher or are likely to have a succession of supply teachers, these are worrying times. And they are right to be concerned: teachers all agree that, although primary school pupils are particularly vulnerable, the lack of a permanent teacher may cause problems for any age group. The reception year of primary school - when children enter at age four and five - is arguably the most important because it is the foundation for a child's entire educational career. But it is not long before they are seven and preparing to take the first round of statutory national curriculum tests in year 2. After that, they have the prospect of the arguably more important tests for 11-year olds in year 6. </p> <p>And it is these critical years, when pupils take the national curriculum SATs tests, that are particularly difficult to fill, says Eric Spear, head of Staplehurst School near Maidstone in Kent. \"The job has completely changed,\" he explains. \"There is so much pressure on teachers to get their pupils through tests that the job has lost its attraction for many people.\" This year, he says, he'd all but given up trying to fill a vacant post for a year 2 teacher until \"someone literally walked in off the street and asked me if there were any jobs going\". </p> <p>Spear, like many other headteachers, stresses that many supply teachers \"are very experienced teaching staff who simply want the flexibility of temporary work and the better pay\". But however good the quality of the teaching, there are some things they simply can't do. </p> <p>Jeni Riley, head of primary education at London University's Institute of Education, says: \"It takes time for young people - from those in the reception class right through to sixth-formers - to get to know and trust a new teacher. The way a child relates to and trusts a teacher very closely affects the way he or she responds.\" </p> <p>It takes time for a teacher to get to know their young charges, too. \"In the critical early years, the younger the children, the more idiosyncratic their knowledge base is,\" says Riley. \"It can take a month at the very least to build up a detailed picture of children's abilities and get to grips with their learning patterns and how they respond to you as a teacher. I don't see how someone bombing in for a day can possibly pick that up and do the children justice. </p> <p>\"Although the curriculum has been tightened up and is now very compartmentalised, teaching very young children remains a highly skilled job. There is also the issue of pastoral care, which for youngsters is as important as teaching. It is not like being a temporary typist, when you can drift in and out.\" </p> <p>Children often react adversely to temporary staff, she claims. \"Some schools in London rely very heavily on supply teachers and they are very much a feature of our schools. But it is difficult for the supply teachers, too. No matter how good they are, children tend to play up when they have a temporary teacher.\" </p> <p>At secondary level, problems are at their most intense for the 11-year-olds who have just joined the school. The Department for Education and Employment has recently recognised the significance of the switch to senior secondary school in year 7, where 11- and 12-year-olds commonly suffer a dip in academic performance as they adjust to their new environment and academic demands. </p> <p>Christina Baski, whose son recently switched from a tiny Suffolk primary to a large secondary school, said she discovered that her son had been skipping lunch because he did not understand how the staggered lunchtime system worked. \"Basically, he was starving all day because he didn't know where to go or who to sit with\", she explained. \"He had two temporary teachers and did not know who to go to, to discuss his problems. He was so hungry that by the afternoon he couldn't even work\". </p> <p>But at secondary level, too, there is no \"safe age\" to be teacherless.

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of last term, the deputy head of one Hackney comprehensive went to greet one of her growing number of supply teachers. She was surprised to find a frail 80-year-old slumped in a chair, and even more surprised to see that the pupils had taken pity on the chap - they spent most of the rest of the day looking after him. Later the same day, at the same school, another supply teacher walked out of the classroom after complaining that her unruly pupils did not show her the respect she deserved, while a third was spotted, feet up on the desk, reading the papers while his pupils ran riot around him. Thousands of children will return to school this week without a permanent teacher at the front of the classroom, as record numbers of staff jobs remain unfilled in an unprecedented recruitment crisis. Although the problem is widespread - affecting tiny rural primary schools as well as sprawling inner-city comprehensives - the shortage is most serious in London. New figures to be published next month will show record vacancies in the capital of 1,020 - the highest figure ever. The problem is not new, and it shows no sign of abating: as the number of vacancies rises, the number of trainees plummets. Some schools have now become reliant on supply teachers - pupils in one inner-city secondary were taught by 13 different maths teachers in the course of a year. And they may be the lucky ones: a few schools have been unable to reopen at all, or have been forced to send pupils home early because of staff shortages, creating unexpected childcare problems for parents. For parents whose children come home to report that they have only a temporary teacher or are likely to have a succession of supply teachers, these are worrying times. And they are right to be concerned: teachers all agree that, although primary school pupils are particularly vulnerable, the lack of a permanent teacher may cause problems for any age group. The reception year of primary school - when children enter at age four and five - is arguably the most important because it is the foundation for a child's entire educational career. But it is not long before they are seven and preparing to take the first round of statutory national curriculum tests in year 2. After that, they have the prospect of the arguably more important tests for 11-year olds in year 6. And it is these critical years, when pupils take the national curriculum SATs tests, that are particularly difficult to fill, says Eric Spear, head of Staplehurst School near Maidstone in Kent. \"The job has completely changed,\" he explains. \"There is so much pressure on teachers to get their pupils through tests that the job has lost its attraction for many people.\" This year, he says, he'd all but given up trying to fill a vacant post for a year 2 teacher until \"someone literally walked in off the street and asked me if there were any jobs going\". Spear, like many other headteachers, stresses that many supply teachers \"are very experienced teaching staff who simply want the flexibility of temporary work and the better pay\". But however good the quality of the teaching, there are some things they simply can't do. Jeni Riley, head of primary education at London University's Institute of Education, says: \"It takes time for young people - from those in the reception class right through to sixth-formers - to get to know and trust a new teacher. The way a child relates to and trusts a teacher very closely affects the way he or she responds.\" It takes time for a teacher to get to know their young charges, too. \"In the critical early years, the younger the children, the more idiosyncratic their knowledge base is,\" says Riley. \"It can take a month at the very least to build up a detailed picture of children's abilities and get to grips with their learning patterns and how they respond to you as a teacher. I don't see how someone bombing in for a day can possibly pick that up and do the children justice. \"Although the curriculum has been tightened up and is now very compartmentalised, teaching very young children remains a highly skilled job. There is also the issue of pastoral care, which for youngsters is as important as teaching. It is not like being a temporary typist, when you can drift in and out.\" Children often react adversely to temporary staff, she claims. \"Some schools in London rely very heavily on supply teachers and they are very much a feature of our schools. But it is difficult for the supply teachers, too. No matter how good they are, children tend to play up when they have a temporary teacher.\" At secondary level, problems are at their most intense for the 11-year-olds who have just joined the school. The Department for Education and Employment has recently recognised the significance of the switch to senior secondary school in year 7, where 11- and 12-year-olds commonly suffer a dip in academic performance as they adjust to their new environment and academic demands. Christina Baski, whose son recently switched from a tiny Suffolk primary to a large secondary school, said she discovered that her son had been skipping lunch because he did not understand how the staggered lunchtime system worked. \"Basically, he was starving all day because he didn't know where to go or who to sit with\", she explained. \"He had two temporary teachers and did not know who to go to, to discuss his problems. He was so hungry that by the afternoon he couldn't even work\". But at secondary level, too, there is no \"safe age\" to be teacherless. After the \"settling in\" in years 7 and 8, teenagers then have SATs tests to prepare for in year 9 at age 14, followed by preparation for GCSEs. Some heads say they are particularly badly affected by the shortages in maths and modern language teaching, and claim it is virtually impossible to prioritise some year groups above others because of the pressures on all years. This leaves some heads trying to pull off an impossible juggling act. \"The whole thing can be an absolute nightmare,\" says one head of a top-performing, large comprehensive. \"You have to start rejigging timetables to account for the fact that people are not available. For example, you may have to start changing subjects, giving one year group extra English because you have a shortage of maths teachers. The whole thing has to be done as seamlessly as possible so as not to upset parents, and you have to make sure you spread the supply teachers and even student teachers around. \"By accident, a child once got four student teachers in one term and the parents, quite justifiably, complained.

      "body": "<p>The days when advertising agencies could turn away dot.com clients because they had more business than they knew what to do with appear to be over. Dot.com ad spends in July were 44% down on the previous month, according to figures released by the media agency, Carat.</p> <p>This is the first time that the drop in investor confidence in e-commerce has begun to make itself felt in the advertising world. Until this summer advertising expenditure by dot.com companies had been rising rapidly. The amount spent on advertising campaigns by dot.coms increased from \u00a37 million or 1% of total advertising spend in August 1999 to \u00a370 million or 8.3% in May 2000. </p> <p>But by July it was back down to \u00a337 million and 5.8% of all advertising expenditure. The drop meant that by July advertisers had to spend less than half of what they used to spend to have the same impact. The highest-spending dot.com advertiser in July was BT, which spend \u00a32.7 million, and advertisers spending just \u00a3350,000 a month made it into the top 20.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of business promised at the beginning of the year that simply hasn't delivered,\" said Guy Abrahams, strategic director at Carat. \"The effects of the Wall Street judders this March and the subsequent fall in investor confidence have resulted in greater scrutiny of previously generous advertising budgets. I think we will see another drop for August, which is always a quiet month for advertisers, then things will start to pick up.\"</p> <p>The falls were by no means uniform across all media. While July's outdoor spend fell by 71% month on month (confirming outdoor's reputation as the first to benefit from boom and the first to suffer bust), press only fell by 30%. </p> <p>This is possibly a reflection of the increasingly tactical nature of the market. The good news for advertising agencies is that things will get better, although we are unlikely to see the mega-rises of earlier this year. </p> <p>Abrahams predicts year-on-year increases in dot.com ad spends of between 50% and 100% in the months leading up to Christmas. This will be made up partly of successful foreign e-commerce advertisers and partly of established, so-called \"clicks and mortar\" companies, which operate both on the web and on the high street.</p> <p>This will, he says, make it increasingly difficult to classify dot.com advertisers as we see companies such as Woolworth's or Virgin advertising their stores and websites at the same time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The days when advertising agencies could turn away dot.com clients because they had more business than they knew what to do with appear to be over. Dot.com ad spends in July were 44% down on the previous month, according to figures released by the media agency, Carat. This is the first time that the drop in investor confidence in e-commerce has begun to make itself felt in the advertising world. Until this summer advertising expenditure by dot.com companies had been rising rapidly. The amount spent on advertising campaigns by dot.coms increased from \u00a37 million or 1% of total advertising spend in August 1999 to \u00a370 million or 8.3% in May 2000. But by July it was back down to \u00a337 million and 5.8% of all advertising expenditure. The drop meant that by July advertisers had to spend less than half of what they used to spend to have the same impact. The highest-spending dot.com advertiser in July was BT, which spend \u00a32.7 million, and advertisers spending just \u00a3350,000 a month made it into the top 20. \"There was a lot of business promised at the beginning of the year that simply hasn't delivered,\" said Guy Abrahams, strategic director at Carat. \"The effects of the Wall Street judders this March and the subsequent fall in investor confidence have resulted in greater scrutiny of previously generous advertising budgets. I think we will see another drop for August, which is always a quiet month for advertisers, then things will start to pick up.\" The falls were by no means uniform across all media. While July's outdoor spend fell by 71% month on month (confirming outdoor's reputation as the first to benefit from boom and the first to suffer bust), press only fell by 30%. This is possibly a reflection of the increasingly tactical nature of the market. The good news for advertising agencies is that things will get better, although we are unlikely to see the mega-rises of earlier this year. Abrahams predicts year-on-year increases in dot.com ad spends of between 50% and 100% in the months leading up to Christmas. This will be made up partly of successful foreign e-commerce advertisers and partly of established, so-called \"clicks and mortar\" companies, which operate both on the web and on the high street. This will, he says, make it increasingly difficult to classify dot.com advertisers as we see companies such as Woolworth's or Virgin advertising their stores and websites at the same time.",

Last autumn, when the new, life-saving jab was launched against a disease that held only terror for anybody with a family, it all seemed so simple. People were camping out in their GP's waiting room, determined to get their child protected. They wrote furious letters to the authorities, demanding to know why only babies and teenagers could be vaccinated. They were outraged by talk of vaccine shortages. </p> <p>But that was a few short seasons ago. Since then, a slow and soggy summer - in terms of news stories - has turned all that hope and conviction into a quagmire of uncertainty. First the Express and then the Observer have alleged the meningitis C vaccine is not as safe as the experts insist. The Observer said 11 deaths had been linked to the jab, and there had been a cover-up. </p> <p>The chief medical officer went into an apoplectic spin, and with some justification. These stories were based on data from the yellow card system - not the smartest way of recording side-effects from medical treatment, but the only one the UK has. Doctors are asked to send in a yellow card to the Medicines Control Agency if any of their patients has an unexpected reaction while on a drug or medication. So when a patient dies suddenly and they have recently been vaccinated against meningitis C, some GPs will feel moved to send in a yellow card. </p> <p>What the MCA is collecting is raw data. It needs investigation. Each of the 12 (not 11) deaths reported on yellow cards in which vaccination was mentioned has been investigated. And, say the committee on safety of medicines and the joint committee on vaccinations and immunisation, who issued a high-level rebuttal, none of the deaths were due to the jab. So why did these 12 people die? Seven were babies who died of sudden infant death syndrome - cot death - which peaks in the age group being given the vaccination. Two died of meningitis B - time and again public health officials have warned that the C vaccine does not protect against the B strain. One had pneumococcal septicaemia, one died of bronchiolitis and one from pneumonia. </p> <p>It's pretty hard to support the hypothesis that the meningitis C vaccination caused all these deaths once you know the facts - although the conspiracy theorists who abound in the anti-vaccination lobby would no doubt still try. But if newspapers can get it wrong, how are people with much less access to those in the know supposed to get it right? </p> <p>The fact is that vaccinations are scary. The big hard truth about them is that each one of us, in taking our child along, is being asked to do the sort of risk assessment that for decades we were not thought grown-up enough to tackle. Doctors used to do it for us and lay down the law - vaccination saves lives, even if some people suffer side-effects from it, and therefore you will be vaccinated. That is not on any more. </p> <p>But we are in transition. Because doctors used to refuse to admit there were risks, we still do not believe them when they tell us there are risks, but they are tiny in comparison to the horror of children's deaths. To complicate matters further, we are asked not to consider the risk to our own child - but the safety of the entire vulnerable population. Vaccination only keeps disease at bay if the whole herd is immunised. Public health officials fear a measles outbreak is imminent because of parents' reluctance to take children for the MMR jab, born of what they claim are groundless fears. </p> <p>If we are to be able to make a cool, calm, rational judgement about any vaccination, we need absolute openness. All the facts have to be on the table. The MCA has always been the most secretive of government agencies, suspected of being hand in glove with drug companies. That has to change. The meningitis C vaccine has already cut meninigitis cases by 85% among those vaccinated - seven in the last three months instead of 45 last year. But for such vaccinations to continue to save lives we need to be able to trust the people who tell us we have nothing to fear.</p> <p>\u0095 Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health correspondent.

One had pneumococcal septicaemia, one died of bronchiolitis and one from pneumonia. It's pretty hard to support the hypothesis that the meningitis C vaccination caused all these deaths once you know the facts - although the conspiracy theorists who abound in the anti-vaccination lobby would no doubt still try. But if newspapers can get it wrong, how are people with much less access to those in the know supposed to get it right? The fact is that vaccinations are scary. The big hard truth about them is that each one of us, in taking our child along, is being asked to do the sort of risk assessment that for decades we were not thought grown-up enough to tackle. Doctors used to do it for us and lay down the law - vaccination saves lives, even if some people suffer side-effects from it, and therefore you will be vaccinated. That is not on any more. But we are in transition. Because doctors used to refuse to admit there were risks, we still do not believe them when they tell us there are risks, but they are tiny in comparison to the horror of children's deaths. To complicate matters further, we are asked not to consider the risk to our own child - but the safety of the entire vulnerable population. Vaccination only keeps disease at bay if the whole herd is immunised. Public health officials fear a measles outbreak is imminent because of parents' reluctance to take children for the MMR jab, born of what they claim are groundless fears. If we are to be able to make a cool, calm, rational judgement about any vaccination, we need absolute openness. All the facts have to be on the table. The MCA has always been the most secretive of government agencies, suspected of being hand in glove with drug companies. That has to change. The meningitis C vaccine has already cut meninigitis cases by 85% among those vaccinated - seven in the last three months instead of 45 last year. But for such vaccinations to continue to save lives we need to be able to trust the people who tell us we have nothing to fear. \u0095 Sarah Boseley is the Guardian's health correspondent.

      "body": "<p>It's been said that taking drugs to fight depression has the opposite effect to drinking alcohol. With alcohol you get the good bits first and the hangover later. With antidepressants you get the unpleasant side effects first and it can take up to six weeks to feel the benefits. It's no wonder that many people get fed up and stop taking them, leaving depression as not only one of the most common medical problems around, but one of the most under treated. </p> <p>So it's handy that a paper in last week's British Medical Journal suggests that there may be an alternative pill for treating depression. Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort), a herb used in ancient Greece to cure demonic possession, may be as effective as routine antidepressants in relieving depression. In a German study of 324 patients with mild to moderate depression, those who took St John's wort for six weeks reported nearly half as many side effects as those on routine antidepressants and only 3% stopped taking the herb. About 16% of those taking antidepressants stopped because of side effects. </p> <p>\"We've known for a while that St John's wort works for depression,\" says Patricia White, spokeswoman for the Depression Alliance. \"In Germany it has been prescribed for 20 to 30 years. Patients don't seem to be told about it in the UK, which is a shame because some people may feel it's more acceptable to take a herbal remedy before trying antidepressants.\" </p> <p>National surveys show that people are reluctant to take medication for depression, according to Dr Paul Bebbington, professor of social and community psychiatry at University College, London. \"People often think they should be able to deal with it without taking tablets - that they should just pull their socks up. When you are depressed you have a low tolerance for side effects anyway. People particularly dislike having a dry mouth and feeling woozy.\" Other common side effects include blurred vision, headaches, constipation and nausea. \"But some symptoms that people attribute to the antidepressants, like tiredness, are actually due to the depression,\" says Bebbington. Stephen Harrison, a 42-year-old teacher, now retired on medical grounds, has been taking St John's wort for depression for two years, after being on antidepressants for six years. It took him over a decade to be diagnosed and given any treatment at all. \"I probably had my first major depressive episode in my early 20s,\" he says. \"It seems pretty obvious that was what it was now but then my doctor called it burn out. I was on a graduate trainee banking scheme and I just felt this unhappiness creep over me. I went to bed for a week - I couldn't face getting up.\" </p> <p>He left banking and became a teacher, moved to Gloucestershire and got married. He was well until his 30s when the symptoms of depression started creeping back. \"They were classic symptoms - although I didn't realise - I didn't want to get up in the mornings, I was sad and tearful, in my worst moments I felt suicidal. I went off my food, I lost weight. But I was still in denial about my depression.\" His new GP was direct with him. \"He immediately said, 'Come on, this is depression,'\" says Harrison, \"My reaction was relief that someone had put a name to it.\" </p> <p>Prozac didn't help but other antidepressants did. \"I wouldn't run them down but I reached the stage where I didn't want to fill up my system with these drugs. They made me feel drowsy and I got a little confused at times. My short-term memory seemed to go a bit. I heard about St John's wort and knew people who were taking it so I thought I would give it a try. I didn't tell my GP until afterwards and he said, 'Fine if it works for you.' I got the right dose by trial and error, taking different brands and different strengths. I don't get any side effects with it. I get the odd day when I feel a bit depressed again but that's all it is. I have found it to be incredibly effective for me.\" With his depression under control Harrison feels obliged to be open with people about his ill ness. \"Everyone who knows me knows what I have suffered from. There is still a stigma around depression, especially for men. It's unfortunate we use the word depression to cover such a range of feeling. We say a film is depressing but it's not in the true sense of the word.\" </p> <p>The Depression Alliance estimates that one in four people will suffer from depression sufficiently badly to benefit from taking antidepressants of some sort. Many don't even see their doctors. \"Depression can be a relapsing condition and it is bad news to suffer from it without treatment, says Bebbington. The causes are not clear; genetics and circumstances both play a part: \"It's probably due to a range of factors. I tend to think a lot of it is down to adversity and social circumstances.\" </p> <p>\"We find lots of people with depression have had an adverse life event, such as bereavement or redundancy,\" says Patricia White. Why these things work on the brain to reduce levels of serotonin [a neurotransmitter - a chemical messenger between nerve cells] in the brain is unknown. But antidepressants work for over 75% of people. They generally block off receptors in the brain so that people with depression can reuptake serotonin at the same speed as everyone else. It's a biochemical disorder. Some people don't like the idea of taking drugs that interfere with chemicals in the brain.\" </p> <p>It's not clear how St John's wort works - it has at least 10 compounds that may contribute to its pharmacological effects such as flavinoids and xanthones. Its side effects, such as confusion and stomach upsets are generally mild, although it can react dangerously with other drugs such as warfarin (a blood thinning drug) and tetracycline (an antibiotic). Despite its pharmacological activity it is sold as a food supplement and not registered as a drug in the UK - so preparations are not standardised or available on the NHS. \"In Germany it is registered drug with standardised preparations,\" says Edward Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the university of Exeter. \"In the UK the amount of St John's wort in a preparation can vary from 100% to zero. Doctors know very little about how to use it and what doses are needed.\" </p> <p>If the Medicines Control Agency was to consider registering St John's wort as a medicine, the herb may never make it. \"It is difficult to register any herbal drug,\" says Ernst. \"There are toxicology problems; each herb has many compounds, not a single clean one. How can you know which compound you have to supply toxicity data for? A third category may be needed that falls between registered medicines and food supplements.\" </p> <p>Even without registered medicine status, doctors may feel it's appropriate to suggest St John's wort as a first line drug for mild and moderate depression. \"But you would have to treat it like a new drug and be rather careful, especially as it is not subject to the normal surveillance system for drug side effects,\" says Bebbington. \"There are side effects that only emerge when the drug is used in clinical practice as opposed to trials.\" </p> <p>\"We think the most important thing is that people have an informed choice about which medication they take,\" says White. \"We would also suggest they have a talking therapy as well such as psychotherapy or counselling. Antidepressants lift your mood but they don't cure depression. It's important that people develop their support networks.

She is three times as heavy as an average American three-year-old and, according to the doctors involved, her condition is \"life-threatening\". </p> <p>Childhood obesity is a severe problem in the US. The latest data shows that more than one-fifth of US children are overweight, and about one in 10 obese.

But look around you: British kids, too, are getting fatter. </p> <p>Last year, a study in the British Medical Journal found that nearly 16% of two-year-olds were overweight and 6% were obese, while more than 20% of four-year-olds were overweight and 7.6% obese. </p> <p>This hasn't always been the case: between 1972 and 1994, English boys grew 10% fatter, and girls 5%; while in Scotland boys got 13% fatter and girls 16%. </p> <p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with a chubby child. But a heavily overweight one is a different matter. Obesity in children can cause health problems: an increased risk of disease, problems moving around, a greater risk of cardiovascular difficulties and of abnormalities in glucose metabolism (diabetes, for instance). </p> <p>This doesn't even touch on the psychological damage a fat child can suffer. \"Every minute of every day friends, teachers, family, TV and magazines are telling them they're worthless,\" says Dr Paul Gateley, senior lecturer in exercise physiology and health at Leeds Metropolitan University. </p> <p>So what should you do if your child is worryingly fat? Should you tackle the issue and risk undermining their self-esteem, or sit tight and hope it will sort itself out? </p> <p>\"Children grow at different rates,\" Gateley says. \"They often lay down fat in preparation for growth spurts.\" </p> <p>\"The first thing you should do if you're worrying,\" says Dr Susan Jebb, head of nutrition and health at the Medical Research Council's nutrition centre in Cambridge, \"is compare your child with others of the same age. If yours is significantly fatter (say one of the fattest three), then you may have cause for concern.\" Then you should see your GP. \"They'll compare your child's size to 'normal' growth charts, and establish whether there is genuinely a problem.\" </p> <p>But the chances are nobody will be able to tell you exactly why your child is fat. Parents will often put a child's (and their own) weight problem down to \"unlucky genes\". They'll claim that their little one eats normally, and yet still gains weight. Genes certainly could play a part in deciding fatness: numerous studies have clearly shown this. But the findings are far from specific. \"So far more than 200 genes have been identified that have some association with obesity,\" Jebb says. \"But we really know very little about the genes themselves.\" </p> <p>What we do know is that it's rare for genes alone to cause a child to balloon. Only five children worldwide have been identified in whom there is a specific defect in the \"ob gene\". This single defect can lead to gross obesity from an early age (and could well be the cause of Anamarie's weight gain). </p> <p>But with most fat children, the diagnosis is more straightforward. \"If your energy intake exceeds your energy needs,\" Jebb says, \"you'll gain weight.\" Not surprisingly, research has shown a marked similarity between the eating habits of parents and their children. Wolfing a Wispa while trying to get your kids to eat broccoli, is not the best strategy. \"You have to create the right environment for healthy eating,\" says Gateley, \"one in which your children eat three good meals a day, and don't snack.\" </p> <p>What you mustn't do, though, is deny your child food. \"The concept of dieting for children is completely inappropriate except in the most extreme cases,\" says Jebb. Instead, the trick is to make changes without your child realising. \"Forget to fill up the sweet drawer,\" suggests Gateley, \"and fill up the fruit bowl instead.\" </p> <p>You also have to get your child to exercise. It's just as important as eating right and it's something most British children don't get anywhere near enough of. Less than 5% now walk or cycle to school compared with more than 80% 20 years ago. Most spend their leisure hours slumped in front of the TV or computer screen. One US study showed a 2% increase in child obesity for each extra hour of telly watched. </p> <p>Setting a good example works here, too. A study of children aged four to seven found that the ones with active parents were seven times more energetic than their lazy-parented friends. \"Kids need to associate activity with fun,\" says Gateley. \"Obesity doesn't develop overnight,\" says Jebb, \"and you can't treat it overnight either.\" Indeed, you shouldn't even be thinking in terms of weight loss for your child. \"All you have to do is stop them gaining any more weight.\"</p>",

This single defect can lead to gross obesity from an early age (and could well be the cause of Anamarie's weight gain). But with most fat children, the diagnosis is more straightforward. \"If your energy intake exceeds your energy needs,\" Jebb says, \"you'll gain weight.\" Not surprisingly, research has shown a marked similarity between the eating habits of parents and their children. Wolfing a Wispa while trying to get your kids to eat broccoli, is not the best strategy. \"You have to create the right environment for healthy eating,\" says Gateley, \"one in which your children eat three good meals a day, and don't snack.\" What you mustn't do, though, is deny your child food. \"The concept of dieting for children is completely inappropriate except in the most extreme cases,\" says Jebb. Instead, the trick is to make changes without your child realising. \"Forget to fill up the sweet drawer,\" suggests Gateley, \"and fill up the fruit bowl instead.\" You also have to get your child to exercise. It's just as important as eating right and it's something most British children don't get anywhere near enough of. Less than 5% now walk or cycle to school compared with more than 80% 20 years ago. Most spend their leisure hours slumped in front of the TV or computer screen. One US study showed a 2% increase in child obesity for each extra hour of telly watched. Setting a good example works here, too. A study of children aged four to seven found that the ones with active parents were seven times more energetic than their lazy-parented friends. \"Kids need to associate activity with fun,\" says Gateley. \"Obesity doesn't develop overnight,\" says Jebb, \"and you can't treat it overnight either.\" Indeed, you shouldn't even be thinking in terms of weight loss for your child. \"All you have to do is stop them gaining any more weight.\"",

When the BBC still refused to tolerate any input to its news bulletins other than by proper, broadcast-quality radio channels, Talbot went on the air from a public call-box outside the gents' lavatory on a Canadian railway station. The royal train happened to pull up.

He was born in Walton, near Wakefield, Yorkshire. His father was an agent for building materials, commercial traveller and pillar of the chapel. When Godfrey was four, they moved to Leeds. Even as a small boy, he wrote in his memoirs, he hankered after being a reporter. At the age of 16 he left school to become an office boy at the Yorkshire Post.

At 20 he was assistant editor of the paper's weekly edition. </p> <p>He left to join the Manchester Guardian, again on the weekly edition known as the City News. At 23 he was its editor, but the following year this publication was closed down and Talbot was given a job on the Daily Dispatch, also owned by the Guardian. His beat was Lancashire. In 1934 he married Bess Owen, daughter of the borough engineer of Wigan. </p> <p>Talbot joined the BBC in 1937, as press officer for the northern region - at this time a hot-bed of creativity. Its producers and writers included Olive Shapley, John Pudney, DG Bridson and Cecil McGivern, destined to be architect of the post-war television service. </p> <p>On the day Hitler invaded Poland, September 1 1939, Talbot was summarily ordered to report to Broadcasting House in London. As he drove down the A5, he said later, his was almost the only car on the southbound side of the road. All the traffic was heading out of the capital, in the expectation of immediate air raids. On arrival, Talbot learned that he been drafted to the news division as a sub-editor. During the London blitz he began reporting, part-time. He had just had his medical examination for the armed forces when he was made an official war correspondent and sent to Egypt to replace Dimbleby as the BBC reporter on the desert war. Dimbleby had made himself unpopular with both the generals and the BBC. Sometimes it was his grandiose life-style, with a liveried chauffeur and a house-boat on the Nile, at others because he was too ready to pass on optimistic forecasts, soon disproved, of how the fighting would go. Talbot's sober style was welcomed. </p> <p>But back in England Dimbleby regained favour with such exploits as his broadcast from a bomber over Germany; when the BBC's new editor-in-chief, William Haley, was planning coverage of the impending invasion of Europe, he grumbled that of all the correspondents available, only Dimbleby and Talbot were up to standard. </p> <p>In the event, Talbot stayed with the Eighth Army in Italy, although he did make one foray into the north-western theatre - and thereby earned a place in War Report, the BBC's record of that campaign - with a vivid eye-witness account of the airborne landings in the south of France in July 1944. \"And then, one after the other, our gliders slipped their tow-ropes and slid and circled down to make excellent landings. I myself saw only one crash. It was most skilful - I saw 14 gliders land beautifully, close together, in one not too big field, half grass, half ploughed.

These covered a wide range of topics, some familiar, such as gardening and antiques, and others which added greater diversity to the schedule, such as a series on scientific developments. Overall, Carlton delivered a high quality and varied service to the London region. All programmes were well produced but the audiences for some were adversely affected by the wider changes in ITV, in which some regional slots moved to 5.30pm and 11.30pm. The amount of programmes supplied to the network increased and included some very high quality productions\" Note: Total annual payments to the Independent Television Commission include a figure based on each licensee's advertising income - expressed as percentage of qualifying revenue (PQR). The amount paid to the ITC will therefore usually be more than the fixed annual licence fee",

The health and beauty online retailer, which pulled in Joanna Lumley as its public face for a 2% stake, announced last month that it had no choice but to wind down its business. Sales had been slow, with total first year sales projected to have reached little more than \u00a3100,000. ClickMango.com was hoping to secure an additional \u00a3300,000 in bridging finance, after initial funding of \u00a33m provided by Atlas Venture and Jacob Rothschild's family interests in October 1999, began to run dry. Norton said today: \"Time is the biggest issue. Rather than risk insolvency, we must now close the business to meet our contractual obligations to our creditors and to our staff. Breaking down the parts is something that we will do as we will monetise all we can from what is left - this is a long process and one that we have actively started to engage in.\"",

The group - Europe yes, euro no. - brings together the Business for Sterling group and Lord Owen's New Europe group. Lord Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary, said yesterday that the title was designed to counter Labour claims that opponents of the single currency were hostile to British membership of the European Union. He criticised government plans to hold a referendum on British euro membership after the next election if a series of economic tests had been met, saying that the prime minister had failed to spell out his thoughts on the issue. \"I don't exactly know what Tony Blair's mind is,\" Lord Owen told Radio 4's World At One programme. \"I think he would like to go into the euro but doesn't want to pay any political price for risking doing so. It is not easy to understand what Gordon Brown wants. He has previously been rather in favour of the euro; on the other hand, as chancellor he has seen the strength of the British economy.\" But Lord Owen's campaign suffered a setback when it emerged that key supporters of the new group have raised the possibility of British withdrawal from the EU. Rodney Leach, chairman of Business for Sterling, recently described the EU as a \"liability\".",

Police officers may have to patrol alone, one of several proposals to be submitted in a report to next week's annual conference of the Police Superintendents' Association. Other recommendations, which could radically alter accepted police practice, include drastic cuts in the number of plain-clothes officers and unmarked patrol cars. Officers may also no longer return to the station canteen for lunch under plans to adopt the American idea of \"eating out\" in cafes and fast-food outlets. Association President Peter Gammon commented on the new rationale behind the report, seen by Radio 5 Live. \"We want to challenge and generate debate about the way officers work.\" He continued: \"The double-crewing of police vehicles has become the norm and we are saying that there should be operational reasons for that, rather than just being routine practice.\" While accepting the need for undercover plain-clothes officers in covert operations, Mr Gammon insisted that on many occasions their use was unnecessary. Referring to established lunch routines, he said: \"What is the problem with officers eating in public?

It was only Hampshire's second Championship triumph of the season, but Kendall confirmed his reputation as one of the county's few bright lights. Here he explains how he did it </em> </p> <p> \"Durham set us a pretty generous target, but considering both sides had to win I suppose that wasn't really suprising. I ended up coming in second ball after Giles White was caught at bat-pad off the first ball. It was swinging around a lot for [Simon] Brown, but generally the pitch played pretty well. I got a partnership together with Jason Laney until he was out just after lunch. The run-rate was never much of a problem; we were scoring at about three an over the whole way through. It was just a question of staying in. </p> <p>\"I put on exactly a hundred with Robin [Smith] - he's getting right back to his old form after a pretty tough year. He played particularly well against Steve Harmison, who worked up some good pace. To be honest, he never really looked like getting out. The Durham guys let their heads go down a bit after that. Lawrence Prittipaul came out in only his second Championship game, but he played his shots and the runs kept flowing. </p> <p>\"It was definitely one of my better innings. To see through the whole innings - from the second ball right through to the end to win a game - is something I've never done before in a Championship match. I've been in reasonable form this season, without getting too many big knocks, but I feel I'm on the way up. My technique's a bit tighter, my shot selection is better, and my one-day skills - looking for ones and twos - have really improved. </p> <p>\"We've had a terrible year. Durham are about the only team we've played well against - we've beaten them both times in the Championship and in three one-dayers. But the rest of the year has been very poor. This was an important win, but the odds are still against us winning promotion. We're relying on Kent losing really badly in their last two games, and that's not very likely. Still, we've got a mathematical chance. </p> <p>\"Consistency in our batting has been the biggest problem. We've managed to get maximum bowling points throughout most of the year, but our batting has been fragile. Our only bowling weakness has been the ninth and tenth wicket partnerships: we've struggled to get the last two wickets for some peculiar reason, and that probably cost us a couple of wins. </p> <p>\"It's been fantastic having Warney here. He has been great both on the field and off it - he's the archetypal team man and his bowling has been as good as ever, without enjoying a lot of luck. If he'd had a bit of fortune, I reckon he could easily have taken 80 or 90 wickets. But he has been an inspiration to a lot of us. We would all like to have him back here - we think he's very good value for money. But it did cost a lot of money to bring him here, and whether the county are able to repeat that I don't know.\" </p> <p>Will Kendall was talking to Chris Ryan.

She made the decision earlier than planned following a hurried meeting yesterday morning with the prime minister in Downing Street. She will stay in the cabinet until the next election and insisted that the decision, made a fortnight before her 51st birthday, had been a personal career choice. \"I want to do something different in my last years before I retire,\" she said. However, it is understood that she had become disillusioned with humdrum domestic politics, which contrasted with the unyielding two and a half years of high pressure life as Northern Ireland secretary. But one cabinet minister said yesterday that she made two possibly fatal career errors last October, including the rejection of Tony Blair's offer of the job of health secretary, plumping instead for cabinet office minister, a post to which she has never fully warmed. At around the same time, she turned down pleas from Downing Street to stand as Labour candidate for mayor of London, only subsequently to change her mind after Frank Dobson had been installed as the official candidate. Downing Street reconsidered Ms Mowlam's interest in the post again as recently as February, but by then Mr Dobson did not want to quit as the official Labour candidate. In June, Ms Mowlam told Mr Blair privately that she probably favoured a foreign political career outside parliamentary politics. She is particularly interested in the worldwide fight against drugs or international conflict resolution akin to the role adopted by the former US president Jimmy Carter. One cabinet colleague said: \"She never managed the difficult re-entry process from Northern Ireland politics.\" Ms Mowlam said yesterday that Mr Blair has sought to persuade her to stay but following her holiday in Portugal, she had decided to leave. The decision to go public was prompted by renewed newspaper speculation that she was planning to quit at the next election. She said: \"I talked it over with Tony...and he agreed it would be worth me saying today what I wanted to do because it was all getting silly with all the rumours and suggestions.\" Ms Mowlam denied she had been forced from politics by ill health insisting she was \"fine and dandy\". She also denied that she had been driven out by the so-called whispering campaign against her, and said she was satisfied that it had not been authorised by Mr Blair. Downing Street also heaped praise on Ms Mowlam and said that talk of a briefing campaign against Ms Mowlam was rubbish. An imminent biography is likely to allege that the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, was the source of the criticisms, but other sources suggest that Ms Mowlam's own friends were prone to dwell on the mythical briefing campaign against her. Ms Mowlam's husband, Jon Norton, gave some credence to the briefing campaign, saying it had started at the Labour Party conference in 1998. \"Some people have said that from that point on the adverse stories occurred,\" Mr Norton said, adding that popular politicians can become unpopular with their colleagues. Tributes poured in for Ms Mowlam, especially for her work in Northern Ireland and her bravery in fighting a brain tumour, but her many supporters said her departure was a special blow to women in politics. Helen Jackson, her former parliamentary aide and MP for Sheffield Hillsborough, said: \"She had a special appeal to women. It was not so much that she was a role model, but they found her very direct approach to life very refreshing and as result she brought politics closer and more alive.\" Joan Ruddock, another friend and MP for Deptford, also hinted that Ms Mowlam had been blocked. \"It is difficult in government where all the slots are pre-determined. She is a person who is very unusual in her approach and perhaps that makes it more difficult for her to get the place she most wants.\"",

      "bodyText": "Mo Mowlam's decision to jump off the political roundabout has brought nothing but regret from the man who runs the real-life merry-go-round outside her seaside front door in Redcar on the Tees estuary. \"She's been good news for this town ever since she arrived,\" says Victor Vernon, a third-generation showman whose fairground on the resort's sandy beach was literally saved from the sea a few months ago by the constituency's departing MP. \"I'm sure it was all down to Mo that the council let us move the roundabout up on to the prom - and the trampoline and the bouncy castle,\" says Vernon. \"We've had enormous tides this year and we were about to be washed off the beach with nowhere else to go.\" Dr Mowlam's reputation is so high in Redcar - a steel town as well as one of the last, rather forlorn redoubts of British bucket and spade holidays - that Mr Vernon might have expected her to turn the tide instead. But her local reputation involves the other side of King Canute's character, as someone politically canny but unusually frank and down-to-earth. This may prove crucial to the size of her successor's majority at the next election; Redcar is not a place with any fondness for New Labour packaging and spin. \"What Redcar people really love about Mo is the way she does an awful lot here behind the scenes, not looking for publicity,\" says Catherine Lynch, lifting her niece Julie onto Dusty the beach donkey - another beneficiary of one of the MP's local interventions during her 14 years in Parliament. Dusty's owner Christine Hodgson was faced with a ban on the donkeys' daily plod up and down in front of the Regent cinema two seasons ago, until Mo stepped in. \"The council wanted the donkeys off the sand for what they said were health and safety reasons,\" says Christine, \"but Mo said 'You can't not have donkeys on Redcar beach' and they changed their minds.\" Small wonder there are glum faces at the local Labour party headquarters, where the problem of succession has been on the agenda since May. That was when Mowlam told her agent Keith Legg and local party chair John McCormack that she was thinking of going, starting what one of them called a \"nightmare\" period of will-she-won't-she uncertainty. The big fear in the party is that someone more attuned to Number 10 will take over in Redcar and Cleveland, a seat Labour cannot lose but one where a slump in the vote and majority would be telling. \"I'd prefer a local candidate rather than someone parachuted in by the national party,\" says Mr McCormack, putting it as politely as he can.

But that's not my complaint.</p> <p>No, what I'm talking about is something different, which falls into two parts. Firstly, there is virtually no recognition on your show that women's cricket even exists. Oh, there's the occasional nod in that direction, such as the feature on Matthew and Julie Cassar, but this was more in the nature of a light entertainment piece than a serious attempt to focus on women's cricket. Where are the reports on women's international cricket? Where are the references to the women's domestic game? Sadly lacking, I'm afraid.</p> <p>My second point is one which is perhaps less obvious on the screen, but to my mind it is an even more serious oversight. Every so often on your programme you feature a masterclass, in which professional players offer advice to youngsters on various aspects of their game. This is a laudable idea: as a viewer I enjoy seeing the players of today passing on some tips to the cricketers of tomorrow. But I ask again - where are all the girls? There are plenty of development schemes and girls' teams around, and surely it wouldn't be too difficult to find a few.</p> <p>Look, imagine you're a young girl who is passionate about cricket. You switch on Cricket Roadshow every Saturday morning to catch up on the latest news and views, and what do you see? A programme presented mainly by men, reporting on men's cricket, where men offer advice to boys in order to improve their game. What would your thoughts be?</p> <p>Encouraging more girls to play cricket can only be beneficial to the game, so the onus is on high-profile shows like yours to keep the ball rolling. I realise that women's cricket has a fair way to go to achieve parity with the men's game, but as a major focal point for most cricket-loving youngsters in this country, you really ought to get your act together and start to portray girls playing cricket as the norm.

      "bodyText": "William Hague today promised to set Britain free from big government, big bureaucracy and Brussels, as he launched the Conservative Party's pre-manifesto document in a desperate attempt to erode Labour's comfortable lead in the polls. In sketching the outlines of Believing in Britain, Mr Hague said that the Tories' new social agenda was based on \"one very simple, very Conservative principle: Freedom.\" Mr Hague's speech rehashed tenets held dear by Conservatives, minimum government, low taxes and cutting regulation. But the Tory leader may have promised more than he can deliver when he said that the Tories will reduce \"the burden of tax and spend more on public services.\" On Europe, he pledged to stop Britain drifting into a European \"superstate.\" The pre-manifesto document included a promise to enshrine in legislation the ring fencing of powers in certain policy areas, such as taxation and defence, which could not be ceded to Europe. Today's document, which will form the basis of the party's election manifesto proper, also promised a range of new rights for parents in the schooling of their children, as well as a radical revamp of higher education. It set out Mr Hague's ambition to establish Britain as a world-class centre for the new economy. Introducing the document, Mr Hague sought to paint his party's policies toward Europe as a defence of Britain's national identity. \"Extraordinarily, the Conservatives will be the only major party fighting the next election determined to stop the surrender of our most precious right as a country - the right to govern ourselves,\" said Mr Hague. The pre-manifesto document said that a Tory government would amend domestic law to include \"reserved powers\" - preventing European Union law from overriding the will of parliament in areas where it did not voluntarily transfer powers to the EU. A Conservative administration would also seek to ensure that any future government which wished to surrender any of Parliament's rights and powers to Brussels would first have to secure the electorate's approval in a referendum. The document warned: \"Conservatives strongly support the enlargement of the EU and regard it as a high priority. \"With the prospect of such enlargement, the EU has reached a fork in the road. Down one route lies a fully integrated superstate, with nation states and the national veto disappearing. \"This is the route down which Britain is gradually drifting. The alternative route, our route, is to a Europe of nations combining in different combinations for different purposes and to a different extent, a network Europe.\" Mr Hague's speech came at a time when the Tories have lost their summer bounce against the Labour government. With its public spending review in mid-July and the NHS plan that followed, Labour has recaptured control of the political agenda and is back above 50 per cent support for the first time since April. The Conservatives meanwhile have fallen four points in a month and are back below 30 per cent. As for Mr Hague, who invited ridicule with his admission that he drank 14 pints a day as a lad, he is once again sinking fast: the proportion of voters who are unhappy with him exceeds the proportion that is happy by 25 percentage points.

      "body": "<p>I didn't think much of it at first: a vague discomfort in the ankle, just part of the general crumbling of middle age. Then came a low-awareness pain that became increasingly acute over a couple of days, until I began to hobble about like a war veteran, trying to be as stiff-upper-lipped as possible - which isn't very. When it comes to tolerance of pain, I am not up there in the Captain Oates league. So I made a doctor's appointment for a few days later, the earliest that the surgery could fit me in. </p> <p>Then I went to lunch at my brother's house, and the amateur diagnosis took a turn for the dramatic. \"For God's sake, Matty,\" he cried. \"You must go to the doctor immediately. It could be a thrombosis.\" He is something of an expert on the subject of thrombosis, having had a suspected one himself. In fact, he's had so many suspected thises and thats that he make Matthew Norman look an amateur in the hypochondria stakes. But when he started up on a blood-curdling description of \"deep-vein investigation\" or some such phrase - \"the most unbelivably painful experience\" - even my sangfroid began to ebb, and I raced to the surgery to beg mercy from whichever GP was on duty. </p> <p>Mercy she brought me. Dr Cabot doesn't stand for much nonsense, but her dismissal of the fears of conditions unknown to medical science is tempered with good humour. It was no thrombosis for me, no deep-vein business either. \"Gout,\" she said. \"Almost certainly gout.\" </p> <p>I didn't know whether to pass out with relief or embarrassment. Gout! I mean, gout, the affliction of port-swilling old fogies. Gout, the scourge of yesteryear. Gout, noted by Hippocrates before Christ was born. Gout, first named so by de Vielehardouin in the 13th century. Gout, the affliction of Sam Johnson, Benjamin Franklin, Pitts both Elder and Younger, Orson Welles and Luciano Pavarotti. What could be sadder than sharing an ailment with Luciano Pavarotti? No one has owned up to having gout for years. Anyway, I haven't touched a drop of port for, oooh, an age. </p> <p>For those who aren't familiar with this condition of ancient pedigree, let me explain. When proteins break down in the body, they create uric acid, which is expelled via the kidneys.

      "bodyText": "I didn't think much of it at first: a vague discomfort in the ankle, just part of the general crumbling of middle age. Then came a low-awareness pain that became increasingly acute over a couple of days, until I began to hobble about like a war veteran, trying to be as stiff-upper-lipped as possible - which isn't very. When it comes to tolerance of pain, I am not up there in the Captain Oates league. So I made a doctor's appointment for a few days later, the earliest that the surgery could fit me in. Then I went to lunch at my brother's house, and the amateur diagnosis took a turn for the dramatic. \"For God's sake, Matty,\" he cried. \"You must go to the doctor immediately. It could be a thrombosis.\" He is something of an expert on the subject of thrombosis, having had a suspected one himself. In fact, he's had so many suspected thises and thats that he make Matthew Norman look an amateur in the hypochondria stakes. But when he started up on a blood-curdling description of \"deep-vein investigation\" or some such phrase - \"the most unbelivably painful experience\" - even my sangfroid began to ebb, and I raced to the surgery to beg mercy from whichever GP was on duty. Mercy she brought me. Dr Cabot doesn't stand for much nonsense, but her dismissal of the fears of conditions unknown to medical science is tempered with good humour. It was no thrombosis for me, no deep-vein business either. \"Gout,\" she said. \"Almost certainly gout.\" I didn't know whether to pass out with relief or embarrassment. Gout! I mean, gout, the affliction of port-swilling old fogies. Gout, the scourge of yesteryear. Gout, noted by Hippocrates before Christ was born. Gout, first named so by de Vielehardouin in the 13th century. Gout, the affliction of Sam Johnson, Benjamin Franklin, Pitts both Elder and Younger, Orson Welles and Luciano Pavarotti. What could be sadder than sharing an ailment with Luciano Pavarotti? No one has owned up to having gout for years. Anyway, I haven't touched a drop of port for, oooh, an age. For those who aren't familiar with this condition of ancient pedigree, let me explain. When proteins break down in the body, they create uric acid, which is expelled via the kidneys. Gout arises when levels of uric acid in the bloodstream rise too high, although we \"don't fully understand the exact mechanics\", according to www.arthritislink.com. If you have high uric acid levels for any length of time, it leads to deposits of sodium urate crystals in certain joints. Those relating to the foot are favoured. Toes are a particular speciality. Knees and elbows can't be ruled out. When these crystals achieve critical mass, they rub against the tender parts of the joint. Hence the swelling, hence the pain. Hence the trip to the doctor.

      "body": "<p>The most dangerous word in cricket is \"unprecedented\". The moment you suggest something has never happened before, someone will announce not only that it has but that it were all a damn sight better in them days too. </p> <p>Well, the scenes at the Oval yesterday were as near to unprecedented as makes no difference. Here at last was the Amazing Millennium Experience that London was promised. England not merely beat West Indies, they crushed them. </p> <p>Only a handful of people in the ground had witnessed England win a series against West Indies before: Henry Blofeld, Tony Cozier and Bill Frindall for sure; a few greybeards in the crowd, no doubt. Six of the England team were not even born 31 summers ago. Nor, gratifyingly, were many of the spectators. </p> <p>As Nasser Hussain lifted the Wisden Trophy, kids - repeat, English schoolboys - were playing makeshift games on the Oval outfield with bags and Thermos flasks as wickets. This is what boys are meant to do. And no one chased them off. </p> <p>They had to go a long way back to find room. The whole of the field south of the square was covered in humanity, and some supporters had to try to squint at the presentation from the Vauxhall End. No one could recall a crowd anything like this. Traditionally the fifth day of a Test match - no matter how excitingly poised - is played out in a near-empty stadium. Tickets are never sold in advance. </p> <p>This time, to unanimous astonishment, the crowds began forming outside shortly after 7am. Before the start they were massing five abreast on the Harleyford Road.

      "bodyText": "The most dangerous word in cricket is \"unprecedented\". The moment you suggest something has never happened before, someone will announce not only that it has but that it were all a damn sight better in them days too. Well, the scenes at the Oval yesterday were as near to unprecedented as makes no difference. Here at last was the Amazing Millennium Experience that London was promised. England not merely beat West Indies, they crushed them. Only a handful of people in the ground had witnessed England win a series against West Indies before: Henry Blofeld, Tony Cozier and Bill Frindall for sure; a few greybeards in the crowd, no doubt. Six of the England team were not even born 31 summers ago. Nor, gratifyingly, were many of the spectators. As Nasser Hussain lifted the Wisden Trophy, kids - repeat, English schoolboys - were playing makeshift games on the Oval outfield with bags and Thermos flasks as wickets. This is what boys are meant to do. And no one chased them off. They had to go a long way back to find room. The whole of the field south of the square was covered in humanity, and some supporters had to try to squint at the presentation from the Vauxhall End. No one could recall a crowd anything like this. Traditionally the fifth day of a Test match - no matter how excitingly poised - is played out in a near-empty stadium. Tickets are never sold in advance. This time, to unanimous astonishment, the crowds began forming outside shortly after 7am. Before the start they were massing five abreast on the Harleyford Road. By midday the gates were shut, making the match an official sell-out for the fifth successive day. Something similar was witnessed at Headingley two years ago when England beat South Africa. Never mind that the victory was tainted by appalling and conceivably corrupt umpiring. Ten thousand turned up on the last day to watch half an hour's cricket - which was amazing even if admission was free. And yesterday cannot entirely be put down to the cheap rates either: a tenner admission, free for children and seniors (a reaction to the criticism about high cup-final prices). People were hungry, no, starving, even ravenous for success. The English had not fallen out of love with cricket: they had just grown contemptuous of the national team. Headingley 1998 aside, one of the few men on the ground who could remember winning anything was John Major - and that was 1992, and received with less unanimous acclaim than this result. But it's amazing what the anticipation of victory can do. The famously officious Surrey stewards barred the entrances - with some glee, I thought. Touts offered \u00a310 tickets for \u00a360 but even they were struggling to get a supply. Hundreds of plaintive victims stood outside the gates as though they had missed the last helicopter out of Saigon. \"But my mother knew Jack Hobbs,\" wailed one victim. Congestion was eased when the empty hospitality boxes were opened and made available to the Great Unwashed, who rushed in and committed the ultimate corporate-day-out solecism: THEY WATCHED THE CRICKET. The Revolution will be like this. There are famous pictures from 1953, when Denis Compton and Bill Edrich were cheered off by a vast throng (all wearing jackets and ties).

The investigation was requested by the leader of the Labour group in the assembly, who wants to know more about the fundraising activities of Daniel Hannan, MEP for south-east England. Mr Hannan is reported to have raised \u00a3100,000 to encourage the Danish people to say no to the single currency. Nicole Fontaine, president of the parliament, yesterday authorised a full investigation into the matter after the Labour leader, Simon Murphy, demanded to know \"whether there has been improper use of European parliamentary facilities and European taxpayers' money\" by Mr Hannan. The British Conservative leader, William Hague, has already faced calls to dissociate himself from Mr Hannan, a leader writer for the Daily Telegraph, who at the weekend addressed the annual congress of an ultra-nationalist Danish party which supports repatriation of refugees. The inquiry will oblige Mr Hannan to declare every Denmark-related donation he has received and to list all his travel and entertainment expenses. Mr Murphy insists that all this must be done before the Danish referendum is held on September 28. While Labour has not made any direct accusations against Mr Hannan, the fact that he is to be investigated is embarrassing to Conservative central office. European MPs benefit from first-class office and staff resources in both Brussels and Strasbourg, paid for by European and British taxpayers. They are required to declare financial donations in a public register but the present procedure is not particularly rigorous and MEPs are only required to update it on an annual basis.

      "body": "<p>It's one of the Queen's less glamorous jobs, shared with the Queen Mother, the Duke of Edinburgh, several bishops, a couple of hereditary peers, the Master of the Rolls and Mary Archer. As university Visitors, they are ultimately responsible for arbitrating students' appeals and complaints. But not, it seems, for much longer.</p> <p>If the idea of a student dissatisfied with his or her degree result petitioning Her Majesty had a certain quaint charm, in practice the system had led to growing criticism and scandalous delays. Talks about reform got nowhere for years - universities were not keen to make it easier for students to complain. Now, however, David Blunkett, the education secretary, has been warned that the whole archaic series of arrangements is about to collapse as the European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated into English law next month. </p> <p>Baroness Blackstone, the education minister, has signalled clearly that she would like to see an ombudsman as part of a reform of the way student complaints are dealt with, and has asked the higher education sector to come up with proposals by the end of the year. Next week the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals is to discuss the issue. It appears to be moving towards the idea of an ombudsman - something the NUS has been pressing for for some time. </p> <p>But the government may not have that long before the system breaks down. From October 2 any student challenging a university's Visitor in the courts would be \"almost certain to succeed\", says Dennis Farrington, a leading legal expert in the field, in a report to the Department for Education and Employment. </p> <p>He urges the government and the universities to establish an ombudsman to determine appeals, believing it to be the fairest system for both the students and the institutions and the best way of complying with theHuman Rights Act which brings the European Convention into play. </p> <p>Confusion and uncertainty surround the Visitor system in the minds of the Visitors themselves, let alone students, according to Farrington, an education consultant to Lawfords solicitors. (At one unnamed Oxbridge college, the rules setting out the procedure are in Latin.) </p> <p>Not all universities have Visitors - students at the former polytechnics have to go to court if they cannot get satisfaction from their university authorities. (Hertfordshire University has, however, appointed Lady Archer as its Visitor, although she is not one in law.) </p> <p>The old universities and Oxbridge colleges (though not, confusingly, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge) have a variety of Visitors, and the Queen acts either through the Lord President of the Privy Council or the Lord Chancellor at different institutions. Some are elected by their governing bodies, which raises the question of whether they are truly independent, while others are hereditary. There are no ethnic minority Visitors. </p> <p>Farrington's survey of universities found wide discrepancies facing students at different universities if they wanted to take their case to the Visitor. Not only does the Queen have two totally different methods of dealing with appeals or complaints, but the bishops and others appeared to be evolving their procedures as they went along. Some, like Sheila Cameron, QC, who acts for the Archbishop of Canterbury, hold oral hearings, though most do not. </p> <p>Underfunding has led to cases dragging on for years. Appeals to the Privy Council were at one point being taken home by a junior civil servant at weekends to be studied, Farrington revealed. The Lord Chancellor's department apologised to Bath postgraduate student Neil McDougall for failing to provide guidance on procedure and timetables. </p> <p>Getting access to the Visitor in the first place is a straightforward process in some places which mention it in the student handbook; but a number of universities said there was no need to tell students about the existence of the Visitorial process because there were no complaints. \"There is some confusion over the legal powers of the Visitor,\" says Farrington, noting that some Visitors appear to be exceeding their common law authority. And although the Privy Council has drafted procedural guidelines in clear modern English, not all the universities concerned knew of them. </p> <p>He adds that the language of the statutes - even when it is in English - is often difficult to follow, and in some of the older colleges actually rule out appeals from students (apart from scholars and exhibitioners when deprived of their awards). Universities in Northern Ireland and Wales appeared to have better information than those in England. </p> <p>Concluding that the Visitorial system was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, Farrington said that unless there was legislation or a government commitment to legislate, a student told to pursue a claim to a Visitor after October 2 would almost certainly succeed in mounting a challenge in the courts: \"I continue to advocate the establishment of a single system to act as the ultimate recourse for students who remain dissatisfied with the institutional response to an appeal or complaint.\" </p> <p>An ombudsman would not be used often if universities had adequate internal procedures and considered alternatives like mediation. </p> <p>Jeremy Hoad, general secretary of the National Postgraduate Committee, is backing the ombudsman proposal to end the \"bizarre, byzantine and archaic\" Visitor system. He urges universities to see complaints as a way of improving teaching and supervision of postgraduates rather than a threat. </p> <p>But there is still considerable support for tradition. Michael Scott-Joynt, the Bishop of Winchester, is Visitor to five Oxford colleges as well as the independent school Winchester College, and is not convinced that a uniform national system is needed, provided that all students have access to speedy and effective remedies. </p> <p>Delays in the Lord Chancellor's department are not a reason for abolishing all Visitors, he says. </p> <p>The bishop has only once been called on to arbitrate a dispute between a don and his college. He appointed a lawyer as \"commissary\" to adjudicate and the matter was resolved. </p> <p>The Oxbridge colleges feel the Visitorial system is quicker and cheaper than the courts or an ombudsman, says Scott-Joynt. The role of the Visitor is not primarily to resolve disputes but to see that the founder's wishes about the character of the institution are maintained, he says. </p> <p>\"Educational institutions might want to see their independent Visitor count in certain circumstances be an important element in any argument about character or independence.\" </p> <p><strong>Cause for complaint</strong></p> <p><strong> Neil McDougall</strong>, a former postgraduate student, has been involved in an eight-year dispute with Bath University, alleging poor supervision, inadequate exam procedures and maladministration. His appeal to the Queen as visitor was handled by the Lord Chancellors' department, which took 19 months to consider his case and earlier this year apologised for \"misplacing\" his file. </p> <p>Six requests for guidance by McDougall were ignored - the department acknowledged its failure to provide guidance on timetables and procedures for presenting his petitions. From May to August 1997 pressure of work for the incoming government meant there was an embargo on visitorial work, and for more than a year only one member of staff was available to deal with cases, and she was \"subject to other ministerial priorities\". </p> <p>McDougall may have received an apology but the Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine concluded that \"administrative weaknesses do not justify further visitorial intervention\" and he regarded the matter as closed. </p> <p><strong> Kevin Wilkinson</strong> moved his wife and two children from Dubai, where he had a well-paid teaching job, to begin a PhD at Aston University in 1997 - only to find his agreed supervisor was not available. After a long and acrimonious dispute he moved to Norwich, where he is studying for his doctorate at the University of East Anglia. Michael Wright, the vice-chancellor, apologised and agreed to refund Wilkinson's fees: \"I agree that your experience was far from satisfactory and that the department of languages should have acted more expeditiously to put satisfactory alternative arrangements in place.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson won legal aid to sue Aston for \u00a3100,000 in damages, and the case continues. The university declined further comment. </p> <p><strong> Francis Foecke</strong>'s dispute with Bristol University has lasted 14 years, since he was accused of cheating in his final exams for computer sciences and maths. He got first-class results in all 13 papers. A committee set up by the university's board of examiners ruled after a two-day hearing that he had cheated in parts of answers to three statistics questions. There were alleged similarities between some of his solutions and model answers prepared by the examiners. He got an ordinary degree. </p> <p>Foecke took his case to Bristol's visitor - the Queen acting through the Privy Council - who in a brief letter upheld the university's decision. \"The visitor is an establishment body and looks after its own side,\" he commented. His lawyers attempted to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights but his application was rejected. Foecke says he now has no further legal options to clear his name unless he can obtain lecture notes from fellow students on his statistics course in 1985/86. These would, he believes, show that he could have produced his answers legitimately. </p> <p><strong>Who are the visitors?</strong></p> <p> <strong> The Queen</strong>, acting through the privy Council of the Lord Chancellor. Enough said. </p> <p><strong> The Queen Mother</strong>. Now that her 100th birthday celebrations are over, she'll be happy to give you her full attention. </p> <p><strong> The Duke of Edinburgh</strong>. Overseas students might think twice. </p> <p><strong> The Duke of Kent</strong>. Best not to call during Wimbledon fortnight. </p> <p><strong> The Archbishops of Canterbury and York</strong>. The hotline to God should see you all right. </p> <p><strong> The Bishops of Durham, Ely, Exeter, Lincoln, Oxford, St David's and Winchester</strong>. Top drawer theologians to a man - and they are all men - but wouldn't you feel more comfortable with an archbishop? </p> <p><strong> The Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery</strong>, aka Henry George Charles Alexander Herbert. If you want a private word, try going to Royal Ascot. </p> <p><strong> Lord De L'Isle of Penshurst</strong>, aka Philip John Algernon Sidney. Since 1979 has described himself as a landowner, so keep him sweet by chatting about the problems of first-time buyers. </p> <p><strong> Lord Jenkins of Hillhead</strong>.

Wasn't she, like, Clinton's girlfriend at Oxford? </p> <p>And so, behold <a href=\"http://www.beloit.edu/~pubaff/releases/Mindset-List-2004.html\" target=\"_NEW\">The Mindset List</a>. Created in Wisconsin at Beloit University by humanities professor Tom McBride, it is a list of modern cultural references teachers need to know when lecturing, and is the hottest topic in American academia since Chelsea Clinton chose Stanford over Yale. Since its release last week, it has been faxed, emailed and posted to desperate university professors all across the country. </p> <p>\"We drew it up because we found more and more that our professors were making references that were getting blank stares,\" says Professor McBride. McBride says for students entering university this September, all born in 1982, references to the Berlin Wall, Yugoslavia or vinyl LPs are going to fly over their heads like B52s (which they think is a rock band anyway.) \"Today's 18-year-olds have had a narrow experience with popular culture and we can't presume they understand certain references that are second nature to us. The list reminds the faculty of the gap that may exist between generations.\" </p> <p>The Mindset List is 50 points long, but McBride said he has found certain statements resonate with professors everywhere, regardless of subject they teach. Among them are: </p> <p>\u0095 lf they vaguely remember the night the Berlin Wall fell, they are probably not sure why it was up in the first place. </p> <p>\u0095 The Kennedy tragedy was a plane crash, not an assassination. </p> <p>\u0095 A 45 is a gun, not a record with a large hole in the centre. </p> <p>\u0095 They never knew Madonna when she was like a virgin. </p> <p>\u0095 Punk Rock is an activist movement, not a musical form. </p> <p>\u0095 Wars begin and end quickly; peacekeeping missions go on forever. </p> <p>\u0095 They have never referred to Russia and China as \"the Reds\". </p> <p>\u0095 Women sailors have always been stationed on US Navy ships. </p> <p>\u0095 Woodstock is a bird or a reunion, not a cultural touchstone. </p> <p>\u0095 Coming-out parties celebrate more than debutantes. </p> <p>\u0095 They have never seen white smoke over the Vatican and do not know its significance. </p> <p>\u0095 They have never used a bottle of White Out. </p> <p>\u0095 Spam and cookies are not necessarily foods. </p> <p>\u0095 They feel more danger from having sex and being in school than from possible nuclear war. </p> <p>\u0095 Yugoslavia has never existed. </p> <p>\u0095 The moonwalk is a Michael Jackson dance step, not a Neil Armstrong giant step. </p> <p>\u0095 They don't think there is anything terribly futuristic about 2001, and were never concerned about the year 1984. </p> <p>And he points out that he doesn't think the necessity of a list is a uniquely American problem. \"My guess is professors in the UK are running into the same wall. They have students who probably think that only the Royals have scandals, and have never heard of the Profumo affair.\" </p> <p>Professor McBride, who is also the director of Beloit College's First Year Initiatives, compiled the list with contributions from faculty and staff. He first started thinking about a cheat sheet for professors five years ago, while teaching a liberal studies course: \"We taught a course called Facts, Fictions and Regions in Between. We chose two texts, Macbeth and Case Closed (about the Kennedy assassination), as both illustrate problems with facts and fictions. And it became obvious to me that the Kennedy assassination did not resonate with the students. Of course this doesn't prevent them from learning, as you can learn about many things you don't live through, but it gave me pause.\" </p> <p>And so two years ago the first list came out, but with each year is getting longer, and this year went into wide circulation. McBride says that while academics really love the list, students, when they read it, tend to get a tad defensive. \"One student recently told me, 'The list is wrong, we do use White Out. We do use pens, from time to time!' \" </p> <p>Yes but only when their computers crash. McBride says the problem of today's first-year university students arriving in September with a limited database of cultural references is due in part to the explosion of media and the arrival of the Internet. </p> <p>\"I have been teaching for 28 years, and there is a bigger disconnect now between students and teachers than there has ever been. Students today are exposed to so much more information, but it's all so chaotic. There are more magazines, more television networks, and their attention spans are being shaped by MTV and the Internet.</p> <p>\"We have lost of a sense of great books, for instance. Students today glean what they know from a more decentralized set of information banks, so finding a common discourse is more difficult. Twenty years ago I would teach a first-year class about substance and shadow, truth and illusion, and students would know I was referring to the story of Plato and the cave. I don't think you could assume they know that today.\"</p> <p>McBride says that if experience is any guide, professors take the list more seriously than they admit. Last year some said they dropped references to Watergate from history lectures, or made time to explain what it was. \"They see you simply can't drop these cultural touchstones in lectures any more, you must explain them. The point of the list is that we want to keep professors from getting hardening of the references,\" he jokes. </p> <p>Napier University, Edinburgh, addresses the problem in a course for lecturers which alerts them to approaching subjects from the students' point of view. \"Jokes are dangerous when you go cross-cultural,\" admits Shirley Earl, head of teaching development. \"But if lecturers can't show humour and character, things would be very dull.\"</p>",

This is when the responsibility for the outcome of many years of personal endeavour passes from the individual to remote and bureaucratic awarding bodies, who, as the Scottish Qualifications Authority has recently shown, make too many damaging mistakes, to hard-pressed admissions tutors, and to organisations too interested in \"bums on seats\" and their pursuit of improved positions in achievement league tables. </p> <p>As if this wasn't bad enough, the whole process of progressing students from one sector of the education system to another has to be completed in the ridiculously short period of four weeks. </p> <p>It was encouraging, therefore, to read that reforms are presently being considered to overhaul the school calendar and to bring forward the GCSE and A-level examinations to earlier in the year.

      "bodyText": "What other business would conduct itself like the UK education system during the GCSE and A-level results season? This is when the responsibility for the outcome of many years of personal endeavour passes from the individual to remote and bureaucratic awarding bodies, who, as the Scottish Qualifications Authority has recently shown, make too many damaging mistakes, to hard-pressed admissions tutors, and to organisations too interested in \"bums on seats\" and their pursuit of improved positions in achievement league tables. As if this wasn't bad enough, the whole process of progressing students from one sector of the education system to another has to be completed in the ridiculously short period of four weeks. It was encouraging, therefore, to read that reforms are presently being considered to overhaul the school calendar and to bring forward the GCSE and A-level examinations to earlier in the year. By breaking the relationship between the harvesting needs of 19th century landowners and the present school calendar, the reforms would dramatically improve the current admissions system and contribute significantly to improving student retention and achievement rates. By providing more time, the system would be more able to match the needs and interests of individual students to the employment, further and higher education, and training opportunities available. This being said, these proposed reforms would not have prevented our local city technology college in Gateshead from refusing a place in its sixth form to one of its female graduates who had only achieved 13 GCSEs including two grade As, eight grade Bs and three Cs.

Recent figures suggest 33% of girls between 13 and 15 are trying to lose weight - although half of them in that age group say their weight is \"about right\".

There are far better ways to get slim and be slinky!</p> <p> <strong> Exercise</strong> There are real fears we are turning into a nation of slobs. So, stop skulking at the back of the gym.

Over half a million hours of PE have been cut from primary school timetables in recent years to include new parts of the curriculum and only a quarter of 14- to 15-year-olds get the minimum amount of exercise they need.

You're kidding me, aren't you. Yup. Seriously, though, what do you do? I'm an inshore diver. Inshore, eh. What does that mean? We cover up to 12 miles from the coastline and also undertake inland diving in harbours, reservoirs, rivers, canals and lakes. Dragging for bodies? You have a morbid mind. Fortunately that's just one of many diving tasks. What else do inshore divers do? Fish farms, for instance, need us to sort out nets or recover dead fish.

      "body": "<p>It's been a good year for Malcolm Wicks, and he was due for one. An expert in social policy and the welfare state, he was shadow social security minister before the election, and was bitterly disappointed not to get the social security job, or any other job, after Labour's 1997 election victory. He was probably passed over because he was thought too Old Labour, with his belief in universal welfare benefits and his ability to say \"socialism\" with no apparent embarrassment.</p> <p>Today he can see the silver lining. He wouldn't be happy running social security in a government which has gone down the road of means-tested benefits: he's spent a lifetime saying that welfare benefits were not just for the poor and dispossessed, but a right of citizenship. \"Poor people's services tend to be poor services,\" was how he put it. </p> <p>Instead, last year, he was pitchforked into education as Minister for Lifelong Learning, with (so it's said) an additional brief of reconnecting Labour with its heartlands. At first he felt like a fish out of water, but a few weeks into the job he realised that lifelong learning was a crucial aspect of social policy. He's probably also noticed that the more disillusioned Labour's heartlands get with Blair, the more indispensable Wicks becomes. </p> <p>He has successfully steered the learning and skills bill through parliament, with much less fuss than was expected. Like most politicians, though, he'd rather talk about the next frontier than about consolidating the last one, and he admits that the next few months are going to be hard work. He says he has to get the new councils to work - many of them don't have chief executives yet - while ensuring that the TECs and the Further Education Funding Council work effectively, even though they are about to be abolished. He admits the funding council has already encountered problems. </p> <p>And the new councils have to make sure colleges run the courses they identify as necessary, which won't always be easy. If local colleges won't run them, someone else will have to be found, he says, and it's clearly intended as a warning to colleges. </p> <p>In August, so quietly that no one has yet noticed, he acquired an additional responsibility, for basic skills. This means that it will fall to him to bring in a package of measures in the autumn designed to end adult illiteracy and innumeracy. For the moment, he's on the up escalator. </p> <p>The opposition to the learning and skills bill seemed to crumble before him. It is generally welcomed on Labour's left (unlike Labour's policy for schools). Colleges see it as heralding the day when further education ceases to be the Cinderella sector. And the Conservatives got themselves hopelessly impaled on Section 28, so that on the last day, after hours of filibustering, Wicks was able to jibe that they had kept everyone in the House of Commons until 3am, a time when anyone who gave a damn about family values would want to be at home with their partners and children. </p> <p>And the package incorporated at least one of his own pet ideas, the Connexions strategy, which gives every young person between 16 and 19 a personal adviser, to help them make not just educational and career choices, but life choices, too. (Connexions is supposed to be spelled that way. It's the old way of spelling it, says Wicks, though uncharitable commentators think some spin-doctor thought a clever graphic might come out of the X.) </p> <p>Business leaders at first welcomed Connexions, seeing it as a way of ensuring that skills shortages were put right, but grew progressively less enthusiastic as it became clear that Wicks saw it as a way of countering social exclusion. \"You've got 157,000 young people - almost one in 11 of our 16- to 19-year-olds - who are not in education, training or work\" he says. Everyone is supposed to benefit from Connexions, but it will focus especially on those 157,000. </p> <p>As it happens, he met one of them recently - a girl in his Croydon constituency, who had found her own place in a sixth form to study for A-levels, but had a small baby and did not know where to turn for childcare. Wicks sorted it out, but not every girl in that position would find her way to her local MP. That's what personal advisers will be for. </p> <p>Wicks sees education not as a grey matter of standards, exams, qualifications, but as \"potentially the most effective battering ram against social inequality.\" He's not so much moved from social policy to education, as brought a social policy training to bear on education issues. He recalled for me that Lord Beveridge, whose report at the end of the second world war signalled the birth of the welfare state, identified \"five giants\" which had to be slain: want, idleness, disease, squalor - and ignorance. More than half a century later, the Moser report reveals widespread adult illiteracy, and \"it's really wrecking people's lives.\" Ignorance remains to be slain.</p> <p>That's probably part of the reason why, in Labour's heartlands, his area of responsibility is less under attack than most. He spectacularly wooed this year's conference of the further education lecturers union, Natfhe, and cemented the relationship over lunch with the discovery that he and Paul Mackney shared a passion for Bob Dylan - the magical bonding effect of which can only be understood by fellow fifty-somethings. Mackney later sent him a copy of Dylan's new release, symbolically called Things Have Changed. </p> <p>He's the unions' favourite education minister, given their growing distrust of Blunkett and their edgy relationship with Wicks' predecessor, George Mudie. But they want a great deal more than he's delivering. He's found an extra \u00a350m for lecturers' pay, but it will still leave them a long way behind schoolteachers, and he has failed to deliver a right to paid time off for study. But \"we're getting a hearing now, and he's committed to lifelong learning\" says Mackney. </p> <p>That may be the result of his own education. The son of the last Labour chairman of the old London County Council, Arthur Wicks, young Malcolm was sent from London to a rather strange private school in Guernsey, which he disliked, and where he did badly, getting poor O-levels. (He failed British Constitution, \"just the right background for a government minister\" he says.) So he did A-levels at the North West London Polytechnic, making him one of the first people to discover that further education was a much more adult way for a 17-year-old to study. </p> <p>\"Further education gave me my second chance,\" he says. \"Suddenly I was in a much more adult, mature environment, with lots of overseas students. But because of my poor O-levels, most universities would not consider me.\" Fortunately, the London School of Economics, where he did his degree in social policy, proved the exception, but he says: \"That's when I realised that one should not put hurdles in front of people - you should have a second, third and fourth chance at education if you want it.\"</p>",

He's found an extra \u00a350m for lecturers' pay, but it will still leave them a long way behind schoolteachers, and he has failed to deliver a right to paid time off for study. But \"we're getting a hearing now, and he's committed to lifelong learning\" says Mackney. That may be the result of his own education. The son of the last Labour chairman of the old London County Council, Arthur Wicks, young Malcolm was sent from London to a rather strange private school in Guernsey, which he disliked, and where he did badly, getting poor O-levels. (He failed British Constitution, \"just the right background for a government minister\" he says.) So he did A-levels at the North West London Polytechnic, making him one of the first people to discover that further education was a much more adult way for a 17-year-old to study. \"Further education gave me my second chance,\" he says. \"Suddenly I was in a much more adult, mature environment, with lots of overseas students. But because of my poor O-levels, most universities would not consider me.\" Fortunately, the London School of Economics, where he did his degree in social policy, proved the exception, but he says: \"That's when I realised that one should not put hurdles in front of people - you should have a second, third and fourth chance at education if you want it.\"",

That's what the LGA thinks. It also thinks the school year we have now does not make pedagogical sense and is at odds with both modern working patterns and modern family life. It wears children out, dragging their teachers and their parents down with them. So, earlier this year, it set up a commission to explore alternatives. </p> <p>Its report, released last week, is terribly, terribly sensible. It opts for a six-term year, in which each of the three terms we have now would be divided into two. The school year would begin earlier (in mid-August) and end earlier (in the first week of July). There would be five breaks in between, of roughly the same length as the breaks we have now. However, the October break would be extended from one to two weeks, and the spring break would fall at the same time every year, instead of sliding around to fit in with Easter. Pupils would sit their exams in the fifth term, and the sixth would be less regimented than others, allowing teachers to pursue cultural programmes. There would still be a long summer break. </p> <p>This is just a proposal, mind you.

The commission visited only two parents groups - a Gingerbread group in Twickenham, and the Devon Parent Teacher Association. The only active participants from the business world were from the travel industry: all in all, 11 tourism groups gave evidence. It was presumably because of their involvement that the report suggests that the school year be staggered region by region to help \"spread the season\". </p> <p>I'm sorry to be a broken record about this, but I do find it worrying that there has been so little dialogue with people on my side of the school gate. I also find it worrying that some unions have decided that the plan to change the school year is a Secret Parent Plot to turn teachers into babysitters so that they can run off to work. If there had been more dialogue between the LGA and parents' groups, it would have been clear that most parents want the same thing as most teachers do - an educational system that works. </p> <p>Having spoken to a number of school heads who have piloted the six-term school year and its more radical cousin, the five-term school year, I would say that both schemes sound as if they suit children's learning patterns. They also make life easier for teachers, and I imagine that most parents would say that was a good thing, too. If they want their children to do well, it follows that they want their children's teachers to be working at their optimum. </p> <p>The call to standardise the school year would be a boon to all of us with children in different schools, too. Parents who work would be driven to wild, grateful crying jags to hear that parents would be told about inset days in advance, instead of at the last moment, as is the case now. Parents of children who suffer from hayfever would be happy to hear that their children would not be sneezing their way through exams. Parents who've been through the nightmare of conditional university offers, June A-levels and August clearing would be ecstatic if the current system were scrapped. Most would not mind the idea of a two-week break in October, when it's still warm in the Canaries and the fares are low. But it's another story when it comes to the question of the summer break. </p> <p>Here, there is a real split amongst parents, with more affluent parents, and parents with family ties in other parts of the world, favouring a long break, and less affluent parents talking urgently about the need for a shorter break. The commission decided to side-step this tricky issue, and opt for the longer break, this being what teachers wanted. According to Natasha Benenson, who runs the helpline for the National Council for One-Parent Families, and who also sat on the commission, this was not a cop-out. The report strongly recommends that the government look carefully at the root causes of the split and take steps to remedy them. </p> <p>If it declined to address them further in the report, she said, it was because lone and low-income parents' reasons for wanting a shorter break have to do with childcare, not education. Lone parents in work spend most of their earnings on childcare to cover the long holidays, and most of their time worrying about their older children getting into trouble. Both problems could be remedied if more thought went into ways of keeping children constructively occupied during the summer. </p> <p>If the school year is a social contract between parents and the state, it cannot divide childcare and education into two separate categories. If the LGA is acting in the best interests of the child, it must take into account the needs of the parents with whom they share their care. </p> <p>As for that \"social contract\", that could use a bit more debate, too. Are we really sure how much time we want our children to be spending in school? Wouldn't many or most parents spend less time at work and more time at home if they thought they could? These are questions that ordinary parents think about a lot. They also think a lot about the contradictions in the present system, for the simple reason that they have to live with them. They have a lot to teach the experts. I hope they see this \"consultation year\" as a good reason to start talking.</p>",

And it's the time of year, too, when teacher training colleges find their phones ringing off the hook as frantic headteachers call in the hope that somehow, somewhere, there might be a bright new maths teacher on offer. </p> <p>Maths education in this country is in crisis. For decades now England and Wales have been caught in a spiral of decline. At GCSE level, less than 20% of students now follow the \"top\" GCSE course, which contains some appreciable algebra and geometry. This is little more than half as many as in 1993. It is also a considerably lower percentage than used to do O-level maths. The result: fewer than 20% of our students are in a position to go on to A-level maths, and of course, not all of them do - currently about 9% of the cohort, a figure that has been static for years. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the gap widens between supply and demand for the mathematically trained, and especially the mathematically trained teacher. Recruitment onto maths PGCE courses has been plunging for years. Large numbers who do qualify never teach; numbers leaving maths teaching have risen hugely. Successive governments lower recruitment targets, and then fail to fill them - even this year's salaries for trainee teachers have not brought the maths graduates in.

As colleagues and I argue in a new book published today, what is happening threatens our economic prosperity, the quality of our universities and the intellectual development of our young people. Worse, many of our elite simply do not understand the problem. Government spokesmen respond to research on students' mathematics problems by citing the national numeracy strategy. But when mathematics has disintegrated, no amount of arithmetic teaching is going to put things right. </p> <p>Let's look at Sally, for example, co-ordinating a big department in a major City investment bank. She was a student on a financial mathematics course. Students were asked: \"If you take \u00a3100, and add 8%, you get \u00a3108. What happens if you take 8% off the answer?\" To which Sally - and she was not alone - replied, \"I know the answer's not \u00a3100, but I've always wondered why. I thought it was because numbers were weird.\" </p> <p>Teach percentages once: students forget them. Teach them again (and again and again): adults will still be fumbling for the rule, and panic at anything but the simplest calculator-friendly question. That is the problem with concentrating on numeracy. </p> <p>But get beyond just following the rules - get, in fact, to the point where you understand some mathematics, and the desperate scrabbling in your memory stops. Instead, you are operating well inside the knowledge envelope - you can show why 8% off \u00a3108 isn't \u00a3100, not just check for yourself that, this time, it isn't. You can work out the formula to take VAT out of prices, not just add it onto them. You may even have more success than I did in a screaming match with my 10-year-old son, who insisted, \"Percentages have to be less than 100. They have to.

It teaches people to identify structures and describe relationships - and it is for this quality of thought that top consulting firms such as BCG recruit over whelmingly from science and engineering graduates. For the great mathematician Alfred North Whitehead, mathematics was \"the most original creation of the human spirit\", which he loved for the way it lit up the unobvious. The rest of us can share some of this - there is a real kick to be had in proving that something has to be the case, that you've got a general relationship, not just some arbitrary sets of numbers. </p> <p>Of course, people do need to be numerate. The fortunately short-lived fashion for not teaching children their tables was crazy. But so is the reaction. Instead of worrying about maths, our politicians worry obsessively about numeracy. Perhaps it is because so many are lawyers and historians whose own maths is so limited. Perhaps it is those headlines comparing British and Japanese children's performance on arithmetic. But the result is an obsession with number, compounded by a passion for \"real life\" contexts that mostly aren't real at all.

They made food for us. And in making food that many of us enjoyed they made places where most people liked to be - even if they did not want to eat or drink. So when Jean and Comfort went, the college hearth went too. The college barbecue is fun, but we need lunch more than once a year. So that is how you find most of us - somewhere between the three extremes - unless we are Desmond and facing four bottles of formula and an unscheduled excursion to swap boxes.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Most parents find primary school a breeze. They can do the homework, know their way around, occasionally chat with their child's teacher and are on nodding terms with the head. The schools generally welcome them; in the classroom, at assemblies and on outings. Yet while the move to secondary school is acknowledged to be traumatic for children, their parents can also feel lost and alienated.</p> <p>An ICM poll earlier this year found that while many parents were happy with their children's primary school, they became less satisfied with their education and teachers at secondary level. \"Secondary schools are not terribly keen on parental involvement,\" says Margaret Morrissey, spokeswoman for the Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations. \"They like the PTAs to raise money but there is no ethos of parents being welcomed into the classrooms like in primary schools. You have to rely on what your child comes home and tells you about what's going on at school - there is no easy contact with teachers. </p> <p>\"Unlike primary schools where there is just the child's teacher and headteacher involved with your child, there may be 15 people teaching your child during the week. At parents' evening, you're lucky to get five minutes with a teacher in a large school hall where whoever is passing can hear what's being said, when really you need half an hour in a private room.\" </p> <p>This was certainly Joanne Dyer's experience. When her daughter started secondary school she was surprised by the lack of communication. \"We felt the school was high-handed. With the uniform, for example - we studied the list we were given closely and bought a pair of trousers that seemed suitable, only to have them banned because they weren't the right fabric. We felt they just changed the rules as they went along.</p> <p>\"And then, later, when my daughter kept getting detentions whenever she forgot a book, I had a real struggle to change their attitude. Eventually I persuaded them that if she had a problem with maths they would help her, and they should be more cooperative with her organisational difficulties, too - but it took weeks even to get to see anyone.\" </p> <p>But things may be set to change. Increasing parental involvement in secondary schools is high on the Department of Education and Employment's agenda, and the education secretary, David Blunkett, is expected to launch a major new initiative to encourage just that next week. And it is not just parents' hurt feelings they are worried about. </p> <p>Educational research in the US and UK shows that parental involvement improves children's reading and numeracy scores and promotes long-term academic achievement and positive attitudes and behaviour. It may also encourage life-long learning. These benefits are seen particularly at secondary school level. As a way of raising standards, it is not only effective but cheap. </p> <p>\"Parents may have the perception that children don't need them to be involved so much at secondary school but its not true,\" says Morrissey. \"It's just less hands-on. If you know your child is failing at school, then in theory you can work with the teacher to improve your child's work and raise standards. And the more the school understands your child's life outside of school the better they will be able to give them the personal and social education they need to prepare them for life in their community.\" </p> <p>According to Ted Wragg, professor of education at the University of Exeter, there are studies from 40 years ago that show the positive effects of parental involvement. \"One study persuaded some schools to invite parents in to see lessons and their children's work, and the other schools carried on as usual. The schools that involved parents saw reading scores go up. The other schools' reading scores stayed the same except one, whose head had been so horrified by his school's scores taken before the study started, that he employed an extra teacher and a classroom assistant. These were the measures needed to raise the reading scores to the same level as the schools that invited parental involvement.\" </p> <p>Prof Wragg believes that parents shouldn't be put off if they can't understand their children's secondary school homework. \"It's different when you are reading a book with your child at primary school to when your teenager is doing GCSE physics, but it is the actual level of interest parents show that is important,\" he says. \"It is the parental attitude that has a strong influence on children's achievements, not their knowledge of particular subjects. Parents should ask their children to explain to them what they are doing. Kids learn by explaining.\" </p> <p>Secondary schools have increasingly involved parents over the past couple of decades, says Prof Wragg. \"Successive legislation has given parents the right to be informed about their child's school, which is why all secondary schools have prospectuses, why there are parents' evenings and why parents have to make up a quarter of the schools' governing body. We have come some way since there were lines in school playgrounds beyond which parents were not allowed to go.\" </p> <p>Dr John Dunford, former headteacher of Durham Johnston Comprehensive School and general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, says that schools are getting better at reporting to parents. He points out that some schools have more parents on their governing bodies than they are required to have by statute, giving them influence over the financial management and policies of the school. </p> <p>\"We have moved from a situation where parents were held at arm's length. They are now seen as an important partner in the education process,\" he says. \"We try to open up schools so parents feel more confident about contacting the school. Their own memories of school may prevent them from getting involved. </p> <p>\"We try to get them involved in target-setting; for example, some schools invite parents in to discuss with their child and their child's teacher at key stage 3 (when the child is 14) which GCSEs the child should do. Some schools invite parents in during the day to see what their children are doing. My school held evening events about school subjects where parents came in and did the work their children were doing. Parents don't always know how hard their children are working and it's tremendously important that children know that their parents understand their work and any problems they have at school. </p> <p>\"When there is that understanding, then you have a constructive triangle between the child, parent and teacher and it's a success. There is no question that it is harder for a child to succeed in school if the parents have no interest,\" Dunford says. </p> <p>Richard Fawcett, head of Thurston Community College (which takes pupils at 13) and president of the Secondary Heads Association, claims there are lots of examples of good practice, particularly around the move from primary to secondary school. \"We have links with the middle schools and our heads of houses and heads of departments go into these schools in the final year and meet the children and discuss with their teachers any circumstances we should be aware of. </p> <p>\"We invite parents to come for an evening before the start of school to hear about the school's organisation and to meet their child's tutor. At that meeting I say 'please get on the phone and come in and talk to us. We want to meet you at an early stage'. </p> <p>\"Our tutor system is different in that we have mixed age groups, of eight year 9 pupils (13-year-olds) and eight each of years 10 and 11. Each tutor, who is designated to look after and support the children, only had to get to know eight new pupils. The child stays with that tutor for three years. If they have a brother or sister at the school then they join their tutor group, so we get to know the family. A child who is in difficulty at school may have difficulties at home.\" </p> <p>He points out that there are probably 50 statutory requirements around the information that schools have to provide for parents, including the school's arrangements for reporting on their child's progress, the exams they have and the arrangements for homework. </p> <p>His school, like many others, provides homework diaries which parents must sign weekly, \"but receiving paperwork and understanding what is going on are different things,\" says Fawcett. \"If you get the relationship right between the school, home and pupil then it is powerful and it works. The ideal relationship is one that is open and confident, with both sides respecting each other's views, which can share success and talk about problems openly.\" </p> <p>Some parents, of course, prefer to leave well alone. Clare Bennett, whose son William goes to Highgate School in London, believes she is as involved in her son's education as she needs to be. \"William gets a report every month with grades for effort and achievement, and every term I get a long written report. The school sent me lots of information about their policies. I have one parents' evening a year. Frankly, it suits me not to be too involved - I am very busy. Like many parents I work longer hours now than when the children were younger. I don't want to get as heavily involved in their secondary school as I was in their primary school.\" </p> <p>But many others will welcome a national strategy on how and when parents should be involved. Margaret Morrissey, for one, will be delighted. \"There is an urgent need for a strategy on how schools consult with pupils and inform parents at a secondary school level. Teacher training courses should include courses on how to communicate with parents.</p> <p>\"Some teachers are excellent at talking to children, but it is a different skill to communicate with parents. We always hear about aggressive parents but if parents are invited in for good things in the school and develop an understanding of the school, then when they have to go in because their child has a problem, they are less likely to be aggressive.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Names of parents and children quoted have been changed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's already time to dust down the school uniforms (only to find they've been outgrown since July) and start the school run again. Naturally, children have anxieties as well as looking forward to seeing friends again and reading about school is one way of tackling them. Numerous children's books feature school life, so here are just a few offering a variety from the enviable to the unbelieveable but all guaranteed to provide food for thought. </p> <p><strong> Going to School</strong> (Usborne First Experiences, \u00a33.99) is an ideal introduction to the concept of starting school or nursery, with all the usual activities and sights you'd meet on the first day. It includes sufficient content and humorous touches to attract and retain interest and is perfect for children aged 2 to 6. </p> <p>Being accepted is the issue handled by <strong> Chrysanthemum</strong> (Kevin Henkes, Hodder, \u00a34.99). A small mouse with a very big name - Chrysanthemum - is excited about starting school, until she finds that everybody else there is called Ken, Sue, Jo or Tom. Only when her teacher reveals her long, flower-like name, does the teasing stop and Chrysanthemum blooms again. An absorbing and reassuring book about feeling different, this is ideal to share with 4- to 7-year-olds. </p> <p>Few of us are good at everything and in <strong> Bernard's Prize</strong> (Dick Cate, Walker Books, \u00a33.99) Bernard is dreading the school sports day - is it really worth taking part when he knows he'll always come last? While he may never win a prize for his sporting prowess, Bernard's artistic skills are ultimately rewarded in this uplifting read for children of 6 and over. </p> <p><strong> Ghosts of Golfhawk School</strong> (Tessa Potter, Hodder Wayland, \u00a33.99) is a spine-tingling tale for 7- to 11-year-olds with a rather grisly theme. When the new girl claims to see visions of children from the past, her contemporaries aren't convinced - until they discover that the school was once an orphanage hit by the deadly cholera disease. A tense and haunting title from the Tremors series for readers with a taste for the gruesome. </p> <p>Schools don't come a lot stranger than that of <strong> The Demon Headmaster</strong> (Gillian Cross, Puffin Books, \u00a35.99). Dinah Glass is astonished to find her new school populated by Stepford-style model children where playtimes are spent reciting dates and figures to each other. Adapted into a successful TV series, this is a highly entertaining read for 9- to 12-year-olds. </p> <p><strong> Dosh</strong> (Robert Swindells, Puffin, \u00a34.99) is a gritty tale of extortion for those of 13 plus. Set in and around a school in fictional Cottoncroft, anyone with a Saturday job or paper-round is forced to pay a weekly levy to an organisation called \"Push\". Students finally stand up to the racketeers and in doing so discover a seedy, dangerous and highly illegal side to the group's activities. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.booktrust.org.uk\">Book Trust</a> offers a wide range of booklists on subjects including bullying, bereavement and divorce.

      "bodyText": "It's already time to dust down the school uniforms (only to find they've been outgrown since July) and start the school run again. Naturally, children have anxieties as well as looking forward to seeing friends again and reading about school is one way of tackling them. Numerous children's books feature school life, so here are just a few offering a variety from the enviable to the unbelieveable but all guaranteed to provide food for thought. Going to School (Usborne First Experiences, \u00a33.99) is an ideal introduction to the concept of starting school or nursery, with all the usual activities and sights you'd meet on the first day. It includes sufficient content and humorous touches to attract and retain interest and is perfect for children aged 2 to 6. Being accepted is the issue handled by Chrysanthemum (Kevin Henkes, Hodder, \u00a34.99). A small mouse with a very big name - Chrysanthemum - is excited about starting school, until she finds that everybody else there is called Ken, Sue, Jo or Tom. Only when her teacher reveals her long, flower-like name, does the teasing stop and Chrysanthemum blooms again. An absorbing and reassuring book about feeling different, this is ideal to share with 4- to 7-year-olds. Few of us are good at everything and in Bernard's Prize (Dick Cate, Walker Books, \u00a33.99) Bernard is dreading the school sports day - is it really worth taking part when he knows he'll always come last? While he may never win a prize for his sporting prowess, Bernard's artistic skills are ultimately rewarded in this uplifting read for children of 6 and over. Ghosts of Golfhawk School (Tessa Potter, Hodder Wayland, \u00a33.99) is a spine-tingling tale for 7- to 11-year-olds with a rather grisly theme. When the new girl claims to see visions of children from the past, her contemporaries aren't convinced - until they discover that the school was once an orphanage hit by the deadly cholera disease. A tense and haunting title from the Tremors series for readers with a taste for the gruesome. Schools don't come a lot stranger than that of The Demon Headmaster (Gillian Cross, Puffin Books, \u00a35.99). Dinah Glass is astonished to find her new school populated by Stepford-style model children where playtimes are spent reciting dates and figures to each other. Adapted into a successful TV series, this is a highly entertaining read for 9- to 12-year-olds. Dosh (Robert Swindells, Puffin, \u00a34.99) is a gritty tale of extortion for those of 13 plus. Set in and around a school in fictional Cottoncroft, anyone with a Saturday job or paper-round is forced to pay a weekly levy to an organisation called \"Push\". Students finally stand up to the racketeers and in doing so discover a seedy, dangerous and highly illegal side to the group's activities. \u0095 Book Trust offers a wide range of booklists on subjects including bullying, bereavement and divorce. For details call 0906 516 1193 (10am - 1pm, calls cost \u00a31.50 a minute).",

      "body": "<p>When Kevin Macdonald and I first discussed making a film about the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, we were clear as to why we wanted to do so. It didn't take much research to realise that neither the full extent of the tragedy nor a true account of what actually happened had ever been told in such a way as to make an indelible mark in people's memories. Perhaps the problem was best summed up by the chirpy words of former German government spokesman Conrad Ahlers who, midway through the crisis, referred to it as \"an unfortunate interruption\" which \"will all be forgotten in a few weeks\". Amazingly, it seems he was right. </p> <p>The challenge was how to tell the story without being sidetracked into the quagmire of the Arab-Israeli conflict, while treating the subject with the balance it demanded. We knew we had a responsibility to offer Palestinians, Israelis and Germans equal opportunity to speak. We didn't need much nous to realise our only chance of making the film we wanted to was to research the hell out of it. </p> <p>In Israel, the situation was straightforward. We knew who we wanted, and we knew we could interview them. But it was downhill from there. Conflicting reports made it hard to ascertain whether one, two, or none of the supposed surviving Palestinians were still alive. What was clear was that whoever was alive had never talked, and that our chances of persuading them to were minimal. Without a credible Palestinian voice, we had no film: therefore, that voice became a priority. When, several months later, we got wind that one man was alive and might speak to us, we simply didn't give up until we got him. </p> <p>In the meantime, we embarked on what we assumed would be the relatively easy process of finding the right people to interview in Germany. Wrong. With the notable exceptions of Walther Troger, mayor of the Olympic Village in 1972, and General Ullrich Wegener, the aide-de-camp of Federal Minister Hans Dietrich Gensher, we were met by total non-cooperation. In some respects, the wall of silence was so deafening it suggested more was being covered up than we were aware of. Our suspicions increased when Kevin flew to Germany to meet a group of strangers and was told \"we know who you are, we know what you are doing, and we will not talk to you\". We had more fixers in Germany than anywhere else and still we could not persuade key people to cooperate. </p> <p>Things changed only when veteran producer Arthur Cohn joined the team. Having made several feature documentaries, Arthur used his unique powers of persuasion and fluent German to their best, working feverishly to persuade people to be filmed. The culmination of his work came one week before we finished editing (eight months after filming began) when Gensher finally agreed to give us a \"statement\" on film. He sat down, said one sentence, refused to answer any questions, and left. </p> <p>We didn't want to make an anti-German film - to do so would have undermined the entire project. Also, as both Arthur and I are Jewish, the film could be dismissed as obviously pro-Israeli if it seemed to pick on the Germans. But sadly, the behaviour of the German authorities had been such that telling the story any other way would have distorted the truth. The events in Munich had been swept under the carpet and that, we learned, is exactly where the German authorities wanted them to stay. </p> <p>Given our obsession with even-handedness, the reaction thus far has been mostly gratifying. There has, however, been criticism. In Israel, some say the film is biased towards the Palestinians, with some of the victims' families accusing us of \"humanising\" a terrorist. In the Middle East, some say it is biased towards the Israelis - none more so than the Palestinian intellectual Edward Said. Said fired various criticisms at us, concluding that the film was \"bad cinema, bad politics and bad thinking\", and accusing us of ignoring the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict - thus ignoring the fact that our film is not about that history. What we do is offer one of the Palestinians involved the opportunity to contextualise the Palestinian position at the time. </p> <p>As Said feels he has a point to make, he does himself a disservice by making it in an article full of untrue accusations. If you accuse people of filming a subject in shade in order to dehumanise them, you need to check the subject did not insist on being filmed in shade. If you accuse a production company of not working with Arabs, you need to check the credits carefully before you do so. And, if you accuse a film of having no new information, you might like to check the recent archives to see a front-page story in a Sunday broadsheet featuring one of the many revelations from the film. Ultimately his attack on us is not much better than the German journalist who lambasted us without mentioning that he had neither seen the film nor spoken to us. Said had seen the film, and should have known better than to use it as a political platform for the 50-year war. </p> <p>We always knew there would be people who did not like the film. What we tried to do was tell a tragic story in such a way as to make sure it never needs telling again. We feel that we met our goals as best we could and, with files full of good reviews , as well as an Oscar sitting in the producer's and director's living rooms, we assume we must have done something right.</p> <p>\u0095 One Day in September, 9pm, BBC2</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair faced embarrassment last night when it emerged that he appointed a prominent Labour supporter to act as a trustee of a valuable art collection, apparently in defiance of strict rules which ban political activists from sitting on such bodies.</p> <p>Carole Stone, a prominent London socialite, was appointed as a trustee of the Wallace Collection in February less than a year after she donated more than \u00a35,000 to the Labour party.</p> <p>The Tories last night accused the prime minister of double standards because Mr Blair declared, in a statement announcing Miss Stone's appointment, that she had \"not undertaken any political activity in the last five years\".</p> <p>The embarrassing slip-up emerged yesterday when Miss Stone was named by Labour in its annual report published yesterday as having spent \u00a35,000 or more on buying tickets for party events. Miss Stone said last night that she spent the money buying a table at Labour's annual gala dinner in 1999 after Millbank, the party's headquarters, asked whether she wanted to fund a table.</p> <p>The Tories last night criticised the prime minister for appointing Miss Stone to the Wallace Collection whose trustees are meant to be free from political affiliation. A source said: \"This sounds like Labour double standards. We are not against people giving to political parties but we find it baffling that the prime minister can say in one breath that Miss Stone has not been involved in political activity and then disclose in Labour's annual report that she is a significant donor to party coffers.\"</p> <p>Miss Stone said last night that she had never made any secret of her support for Labour, adding that she did not believe that constituted political activity. Miss Stone said: \"I took a table at the annual gala dinner in 1999 which I paid for myself after Labour rang me and asked would I buy a table.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair faced embarrassment last night when it emerged that he appointed a prominent Labour supporter to act as a trustee of a valuable art collection, apparently in defiance of strict rules which ban political activists from sitting on such bodies. Carole Stone, a prominent London socialite, was appointed as a trustee of the Wallace Collection in February less than a year after she donated more than \u00a35,000 to the Labour party. The Tories last night accused the prime minister of double standards because Mr Blair declared, in a statement announcing Miss Stone's appointment, that she had \"not undertaken any political activity in the last five years\". The embarrassing slip-up emerged yesterday when Miss Stone was named by Labour in its annual report published yesterday as having spent \u00a35,000 or more on buying tickets for party events. Miss Stone said last night that she spent the money buying a table at Labour's annual gala dinner in 1999 after Millbank, the party's headquarters, asked whether she wanted to fund a table. The Tories last night criticised the prime minister for appointing Miss Stone to the Wallace Collection whose trustees are meant to be free from political affiliation. A source said: \"This sounds like Labour double standards. We are not against people giving to political parties but we find it baffling that the prime minister can say in one breath that Miss Stone has not been involved in political activity and then disclose in Labour's annual report that she is a significant donor to party coffers.\" Miss Stone said last night that she had never made any secret of her support for Labour, adding that she did not believe that constituted political activity. Miss Stone said: \"I took a table at the annual gala dinner in 1999 which I paid for myself after Labour rang me and asked would I buy a table. It never went through my mind that that was political activity.\" She said she believed that political activity covered the work of councillors and MPs. A Labour party spokesman last night denied that the prime minister had breached any rules in the appointment of Miss Stone. He said: \"Buying tickets for a Labour event does not constitute political activity. Businesses buy tickets for such events but that does not mean they are involved in political activity. To be involved in political activity you have to stand for a party or to join a campaign.\" The trustees of the Wallace Collection are responsible for Sir Richard Wallace's collection of paintings, furniture and ceramics which were bequeathed to the nation in 1897. In its annual report Labour voiced fears that the party may be hit by a low turn-out at the next election. It said: \"The government is popular, the Tories are weak and divided and people's motivation to vote will be less - the danger is that turn-out will be low.\" The report confirmed that Labour membership fell to 361,000 last year from a high of 405,000 at the last general election, contributing to an annual loss for the party of \u00a32m.

At the beginning of the appeal by the twins' parents against a judge's decision that they should be separated - even though this will cause the death of Mary - \"unease\" was expressed that independent advice had not been sought. A doctor from Great Ormond Street children's hospital will travel to St Mary's hospital in Manchester, where the twins are being cared for, to examine them and their medical records. Counsel for the parents said they were concerned that the hospital did not ask for a second opinion even though it had never carried out the kind of operation necessary in the twins' case. The Court of Appeal in London also heard yesterday that St Mary's had been bombarded with messages from members of the public criticising its determination to operate despite the parents' opposition. Jodie and Mary - false names given to protect their anonymity - were born at St Mary's on August 8. Their parents had travelled for treatment from an unidentified remote European community with a less advanced healthcare system.

      "bodyText": "Being Britain's most popular politician was, in the end, not enough to save Mo Mowlam. Public approval ratings topping those of Tony Blair reflected the cabinet co-ordinator's love affair with the public but at Westminster they fuelled rivalries that were to help bring her down. As the Redcar MP's husband Jon Norton put it yesterday: \"Popularity is not always the most popular thing among one's colleagues.\" Ms Mowlam's decision to quit follows a long whispering campaign that saw her health and ability questioned by senior figures in the government, with even the prime minister said to be frustrated by his star attraction. Her spectacular announcement yesterday came only a month after she used a New Statesman interview to insist that her political obituaries were premature. \"I don't plan to go. No,\" she insisted in early August. Yet Labour colleagues in north-east England had been privately speculating for months that she could go despite again easily topping the Guardian's cabinet popularity poll this summer. The support of millions of voters could not save her from sniping from some of Labour's most senior figures, which appears to have left her fed up with Westminster and ready for a new challenge. And it was claimed last night by a senior member of the government that last October she made a bad career move, turning down a chance to become health secretary after leaving Northern Ireland in favour of a Cabinet Office post she was to find \"humdrum\". Standing ovation In truth her position within the government has been on the slide almost since Mr Blair's mere mention of her name during his keynote speech to the party's 1998 conference won her an extraordinary standing ovation. Sympathisers claimed No 10 could not cope with a minister more popular than the prime minister and had to bring her down a peg or two; critics argued she became out of control, believing she was untouchable and refusing to toe the line. The result was a series of stories in the media questioning her health and ability, at times fuelled by Ms Mowlam talking of her own problems, which reduced her to tears and, despite the official denials, exposed a growing rift between Downing Street and one of its biggest electoral assets. Earlier this summer she was rebuked by No 10 after repeating calls for the royal family to quit Buckingham Palace and move to a new home. Last January Ms Mowlam found herself in the middle of a row over drugs after admitting she smoked pot in her youth, the following month urging the police to target \"killer\" drugs rather than cannabis. Her decision to appear at the dog wedding on Channel 4's So, Graham Norton show raised eyebrows. If she had not jumped, in all likelihood Ms Mowlam would have been pushed after the election. Cash-strapped since Mr Norton lost his job in banking, the couple will keep their grace and favour flat in Whitehall's Admiralty House, and she has a deal reputedly worth up to \u00a3350,000 for her autobiography. That deal and an imminent biography by journalist Julia Langdon, the details of which Ms Mowlam checked, suggested that she was thinking of life after politics. Peter Mandelson, who replaced her in Belfast last Autumn, and Jonathan Powell, the No 10 chief of staff dubbed the \"Downing Street poisoner\", are expected to be accused by Ms Langdon - despite denials - of undermining Ms Mowlam. Mr Mandelson made clear his irritation with Ms Mowlam last week. \"If she chooses to co-operate with somebody like that and an exercise like that,\" he said, \"well that is her judgment.\" Ms Mowlam, 51 later this month, denied her health played any part in the decision to quit and maintained she had recovered from the brain tumour diagnosed shortly before the 1997 election. The whig has gone but at a party barely two months ago she appeared unsteady on her feet, being helped up and down a platform no higher than 12 inches.

Her martyrdom and fight against the brain tumour inadvertently became Mo Mowlam's own story. The gossip: More spinned against than spinning? Peter Mandelson Cold and calculating, he is a different beast from the freewheeling woman he replaced as Northern Ireland secretary. Relations were strained from 1994 after Ms Mowlam, who publicly ran Tony Blair's Labour leadership bid, discovered that Mr Mandelson - codenamed \"Bobby\" - was privately calling the shots. The friendship broke down last year when Mr Mandelson pulled off a cabinet comeback and replaced her in Belfast. He denied being behind the whispering campaign questioning her health and judgment and her role in the peace process, but his form as a spin doctor puts him at, or near, the top of any list of suspects. Jonathan Powell Tony Blair's chief of staff clashed with Ms Mowlam over Northern Ireland where he was No 10's man in the talks. Dubbed the \"Downing Street poisoner\" by Ms Mowlam's supporters, Mr Powell was frustrated by what he saw as her failure to grapple with crucial details and her poor relationship with the Ulster Unionists. He promoted Ms Mowlam as Labour's candidate for mayor of London in what was viewed as an attempt to get her out of Belfast but Mr Powell vehemently denies being behind any whispering campaign. Spin doctors The official line is that Alastair Campbell and Labour's spin doctors have never said a bad word about Ms Mowlam and all assertions to the contrary are \"c-r-a-p\". The official line from a Millbank spin doctor on Sunday, when asked about speculation that she was about to quit, was: \"It has absolutely no basis in fact.\" It had and she did, and the party's high command was again caught out denying something that was true. Jealous colleagues Her very popularity with the public made Ms Mowlam unpopular among a number of Labour backbenchers and ministers with lower profiles.

All 28 defendants pleaded not guilty and claimed they acted to save other crops that were in danger of contamination by pollen from the GM maize. </p> <p>The six and a half acre crop was part of a farm trial of GM maize on land owned by William Brigham. The group gathered at Mr Brigham's farm shortly before 5am and brought a tractor, a tipper truck, and a cutting device. </p> <p>Their intention was to uproot the maize, put it in bags and dump it outside the headquarters of AgrEvo Ltd (now called Aventis), the biotechnology company responsible for developing the GM herbicide resistant maize, said Mr Farmer. </p> <p>The group cut a chain to gain access to the field of maize then replaced it with a padlock to slow down anyone attempting to stop them. They then began uprooting the crop. Shortly afterwards Mr Brigham arrived having learned of the group's plans and the police were called. All 28 were arrested and charged. </p> <p>\"The growing of that crop by Mr Brigham was a perfectly lawful activity and the prosecution say to destroy it was unlawful because it's unlawful to destroy other people's property,\" said Mr Farmer. </p> <p>\"To go on someone else's land because you have a difference of opinion is in no way reasonable. If you lose the argument, to go out and destroy is not reasonable in a democratic country. What's really behind this is not concern for property but to advance the cause for publicity.\" </p> <p>Before the attack on Mr Brigham's farm Lord Melchett, a former Labour peer who owns an organic farm in Norfolk, wrote to Mr Brigham encouraging him to remove the maize before it flowered and released pollen that might contaminate other crops, the court heard. </p> <p>\"I do hope that in all the circumstances you will see the need for this crop to be removed before flowering,\" he wrote in the letter which was read to the jury of five women and seven men. </p> <p>\"It doesn't say that if you don't do it, myself and others will come down to do it\" said Mr Farmer. </p> <p>The jury also heard Judith Jordan, product development manager at Aventis, who told the court that the firm had not consulted local people before the GM maize was planted. Forty eight farm-scale trials of GM crops began this summer and a further 25 are planned for the autumn. </p> <p>Judge David Mellor warned the jury: \"It is not about whether GM crops are a good thing for the environment or a bad thing.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Labour MP Audrey Wise, who has died of a brain tumour aged 65, was a socialist, a feminist and a fighter.</p> <p>She fought against whatever she felt was wrong and she thought that a great deal about the organisation of society was very wrong. She fought authority in general, oppression in capitalistic society in particular, and took on on all-comers.</p> <p>Born in Newcastle, the daughter of a former Labour councillor, she lived and breathed politics every moment of her life. She grew up with a profound belief in the need to recognise the proper role of women in society. Proudly, she described herself as a \"shorthand typist\", and continued to use that description as an MP - partly in the apparent belief that it might encourage other shorthand typists that anything was possible and partly to demonstrate her support for all women workers.</p> <p>At the age of 21, she became a Tottenham borough councillor in north London. In February 1974, she became Labour MP for Coventry South West, and soon attacked the authoritarian enemy on all fronts. She had already made a name as an opponent of the Vietnam war, and other foreign political causes she took up included Chile and Nicaragua.</p> <p>At Westminster in the 1970s she was regarded as something of a left-wing nuisance , a state of affairs that she viewed as necessary and desirable. She was part of a delegation to meet a representative of the Official IRA, she often voted against the then Labour government's economic policies, and was arrested on the Grunwick picket line, in that struggle to establish trade union recognition.</p> <p>Most significantly, with Jeff Rooker she co-authored the Rooker-Wise Amendment to Chancellor Denis Healey's 1977 finance bill. This introduced retrospective inflation-proofing on tax allowances, which led to \u00a3450m being handed back to taxpayers. It was an astonishing victory for two back-benchers and a testament to the power of a committed, hard-working, single-minded woman.</p> <p>Her most important work was that for which Wise received the least recognition among her political peers. It was on the behalf of women, children and families and, most specifically, about the way in which women experience childbirth. She lost her Coventry seat in the 1979 general election and was out of parliament until 1987.</p> <p>Once back, for Preston, she was made a member of the health select committee and persuaded her fellow members to hold an inquiry into maternity services. This led to a landmark 1992 report, which prompted the Conservative government to endorse the committee's findings and led to policies which offered women more choice and control of their circumstances during pregnancy, birth and post-natal care.</p> <p>The National Childbirth Trust's head of policy research, Mary Newburn, said that it was the impact of Wise's approach that had changed maternity services to become \"woman-centred\" and which has since led to a change throughout the NHS: the lives of women everywhere have been touched by her campaigning.</p> <p>From 1982 to 1987, Wise was a trouble-making Labour national executive committee member and a forceful figure in a number of the party's campaigning organisations. She was a member of the shopworkers' union, Usdaw - which was once her father's union - and was quietly proud of becoming its first woman president, from 1991 until 1997.</p> <p>Fiercely protective of her close, fond family life, she married her husband, John, a dispensing optician in 1953.</p> <p>When she found out about her illness last April, she was optimistic about the outcome and applied as much vigour to resisting it as she had all her life to her many political causes. As her family said yesterday: \"This was one fight she did not win.\" Audrey Wise would have appreciated the irony.</p> <p><b> Hilary Wainwright writes:</b></p> <p>Audrey Wise's manner was that of a campaigner, an indefatigable activist, but many radical socialists, especially socialist feminists, will also remember her as a thinker of real insight. She listened.</p> <p>In her early 1970s pamphlet, Women and Workers' Control, she describes how women who say they don't want equal pay are dismissed as \"backward\". Equal pay was being proposed on the basis that women should accept the same conditions as men; for example, working nights. She recalls such a \"backward\" woman saying to her: \"If the economy wants women to work nights then I need a different kind of economy.\"</p> <p>\"We should encourage attitudes like that,\" said Audrey, who believed equal pay was important, but not enough.</p> <p>Her life combined the per sonal with the political in an exemplary way. The creative humanism of her socialism was apparent in everything she wrote. For example, take her 1970s article, Trying to Stay Human, in the socialist feminist magazine Red Rag. If nurseries were really to meet the needs of women and children, she insisted, it was not enough to demand them from the state: the state should provide resources, but the management should be under community control. She had no faith in the existing state, but a profound belief in democracy and the capacities of ordinary people. A radical extension of democracy was a constant theme of her life.</p> <p>I came to know her as one of the moving spirits behind the Institute for Workers' Control and because of her support for workers such as those at Lucas Aerospace who developed plans for saving jobs by turning arms factories over to the production of medical, environmental, transport and other socially necessary goods. But I was influenced by her through the bridging role she played between the women's liberation movement and the trade unions. Sheila Rowbotham invited her to speak at the first women's liberation conference at Ruskin College in 1970, and she stayed connected. The last time I heard her speak was at a meeting where she stressed the need for the left to take seriously the preservation of biological diversity.</p> <p>She was one of the many people dismissed as \"old Labour\" who were always thinking creatively about the future. If modernisation meant all power to the corporations, she needed a very different kind of future. And she contributed much to achieving that future.</p> <p>She is survived by her husband, son and daughter. <br> \u0095 Audrey Wise, politician, born January 4 1935; died September 2 2000</p>",

She fought against whatever she felt was wrong and she thought that a great deal about the organisation of society was very wrong. She fought authority in general, oppression in capitalistic society in particular, and took on on all-comers. Born in Newcastle, the daughter of a former Labour councillor, she lived and breathed politics every moment of her life. She grew up with a profound belief in the need to recognise the proper role of women in society. Proudly, she described herself as a \"shorthand typist\", and continued to use that description as an MP - partly in the apparent belief that it might encourage other shorthand typists that anything was possible and partly to demonstrate her support for all women workers. At the age of 21, she became a Tottenham borough councillor in north London. In February 1974, she became Labour MP for Coventry South West, and soon attacked the authoritarian enemy on all fronts. She had already made a name as an opponent of the Vietnam war, and other foreign political causes she took up included Chile and Nicaragua. At Westminster in the 1970s she was regarded as something of a left-wing nuisance , a state of affairs that she viewed as necessary and desirable. She was part of a delegation to meet a representative of the Official IRA, she often voted against the then Labour government's economic policies, and was arrested on the Grunwick picket line, in that struggle to establish trade union recognition. Most significantly, with Jeff Rooker she co-authored the Rooker-Wise Amendment to Chancellor Denis Healey's 1977 finance bill. This introduced retrospective inflation-proofing on tax allowances, which led to \u00a3450m being handed back to taxpayers. It was an astonishing victory for two back-benchers and a testament to the power of a committed, hard-working, single-minded woman. Her most important work was that for which Wise received the least recognition among her political peers. It was on the behalf of women, children and families and, most specifically, about the way in which women experience childbirth. She lost her Coventry seat in the 1979 general election and was out of parliament until 1987. Once back, for Preston, she was made a member of the health select committee and persuaded her fellow members to hold an inquiry into maternity services. This led to a landmark 1992 report, which prompted the Conservative government to endorse the committee's findings and led to policies which offered women more choice and control of their circumstances during pregnancy, birth and post-natal care. The National Childbirth Trust's head of policy research, Mary Newburn, said that it was the impact of Wise's approach that had changed maternity services to become \"woman-centred\" and which has since led to a change throughout the NHS: the lives of women everywhere have been touched by her campaigning. From 1982 to 1987, Wise was a trouble-making Labour national executive committee member and a forceful figure in a number of the party's campaigning organisations. She was a member of the shopworkers' union, Usdaw - which was once her father's union - and was quietly proud of becoming its first woman president, from 1991 until 1997. Fiercely protective of her close, fond family life, she married her husband, John, a dispensing optician in 1953. When she found out about her illness last April, she was optimistic about the outcome and applied as much vigour to resisting it as she had all her life to her many political causes. As her family said yesterday: \"This was one fight she did not win.\" Audrey Wise would have appreciated the irony. Hilary Wainwright writes: Audrey Wise's manner was that of a campaigner, an indefatigable activist, but many radical socialists, especially socialist feminists, will also remember her as a thinker of real insight. She listened. In her early 1970s pamphlet, Women and Workers' Control, she describes how women who say they don't want equal pay are dismissed as \"backward\". Equal pay was being proposed on the basis that women should accept the same conditions as men; for example, working nights. She recalls such a \"backward\" woman saying to her: \"If the economy wants women to work nights then I need a different kind of economy.\" \"We should encourage attitudes like that,\" said Audrey, who believed equal pay was important, but not enough. Her life combined the per sonal with the political in an exemplary way. The creative humanism of her socialism was apparent in everything she wrote. For example, take her 1970s article, Trying to Stay Human, in the socialist feminist magazine Red Rag. If nurseries were really to meet the needs of women and children, she insisted, it was not enough to demand them from the state: the state should provide resources, but the management should be under community control. She had no faith in the existing state, but a profound belief in democracy and the capacities of ordinary people. A radical extension of democracy was a constant theme of her life. I came to know her as one of the moving spirits behind the Institute for Workers' Control and because of her support for workers such as those at Lucas Aerospace who developed plans for saving jobs by turning arms factories over to the production of medical, environmental, transport and other socially necessary goods. But I was influenced by her through the bridging role she played between the women's liberation movement and the trade unions. Sheila Rowbotham invited her to speak at the first women's liberation conference at Ruskin College in 1970, and she stayed connected. The last time I heard her speak was at a meeting where she stressed the need for the left to take seriously the preservation of biological diversity. She was one of the many people dismissed as \"old Labour\" who were always thinking creatively about the future. If modernisation meant all power to the corporations, she needed a very different kind of future. And she contributed much to achieving that future. She is survived by her husband, son and daughter. \u0095 Audrey Wise, politician, born January 4 1935; died September 2 2000",

      "body": "<p>At least the members of the Scottish parliament got the important legislation out of the way early. Last year, on the historic first day of sitting, the newly elected members of the newly devolved institution agreed on the following: that they should all receive a bronze commemorative medal to mark their role in history. Exhausted by the legislative process, they then took a two-month holiday. Though not before deciding it would be a fine idea to commission a \u00a3200m building in which to conduct their future activities.</p> <p>Tomorrow, when they start their second year in business, the members of the Scottish parliament will have a somewhat more rigorous agenda. Over the summer, the political news has made alarming reading for them. Take these headlines from the Daily Record, Scotland's biggest-selling daily paper, last Wednesday: \"Beleaguered ministers careers take turn for the worse; exam chaos spreads; waiting lists soar; union chiefs threaten autumn of discontent\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alex Salmond, the leader of the SNP, the official opposition party, has been spending the summer telling everyone who will listen that, technically, the Scottish economy is about to enter recession: receipts are below expenditure, imports above exports, with economic growth too low to mop up the difference. As birthday messages to mark the second year of devolved government go, the Scottish parliament could hardly have chosen a less complimentary one: much of the superficial evidence suggests this is a country which cannot rule itself.</p> <p>In truth, walking round the streets last week, Scotland does not look on the verge of economic collapse. Edinburgh in particular, with its endless new bars and restaurants and a housing market approaching London levels of ludicrousness, looks in rude economic health. In Glasgow, too, the buoyant central business district is full of busy corporations such as Scottish Power, Scottish Widows and Scottish Gas, whose nomenclature identifies them firmly with the sort of self-confident nationalism which would be reckoned business suicide south of the border. And, since everyone living outside the central belt is always quick to point out that Glas gow and Edinburgh are not the real Scotland, it seems advisable to report that business-wise things are pretty cheery elsewhere too.</p> <p>\"Shell has just announced a big increase in investment up here,\" says Amanda Harvie, of the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce. \"Without wishing to suggest we are approaching boom times, I'd say there was overall an upturn in confidence at the sharp end. That is not to pretend there are not real challenges ahead.\"</p> <p>As its defenders would point out, it is the challenges that the Scottish parliament has been set up to address. Success can get on by its own, it is failure that needs sorting out by government. And - impending recession or not - Scotland has enormous challenges beyond an apparent inability to mark examination papers properly. Bad health, bad housing, bad diet and drug abuse are endemic. It is a nation, too, identified by division: north/south; east/west; Lowland/Highland; rural/urban. Many of the divisions are even enshrined constitutionally: this is a country which still legislates to ensure Catholics and Protestants are educated separately.</p> <p>And it doesn't seem as if its globally expansive corporations are keen to help. As Stagecoach, Scottish Media and Scottish Power colonise the corporate world with a voracity to match their empire building forebears, they seem to have all but forgotten the local community from which they draw their wealth and expertise. In the past, Scottish business success was characterised by huge public projects (Andrew Carnegie was the typical Scottish philanthropist). Now success is marked by the size of directors' remuneration. Tellingly, the lottery-funded Museum of Scotland which has just opened to great acclaim in Edinburgh, is the only grand cultural building to be built in this grandest cultural city in the last century. Unless you count Murrayfield.</p> <p>Still, in case it may have forgotten the many challenges it faces, the Scottish parliament can always rely on its media to remind it. In an over-crowded newspaper market, Scottish papers seem to have decided that bad news sells. For his own political reasons, Andrew Neil has ensured his Scotsman keeps its teeth never far from the jugular. Even the traditionally Labour-supporting Daily Record has administered almost daily assaults on Donald Dewar and his team since the moment they took office. The failures of the examination system or fears of impending recession are given far greater prominence than the revelation that 29 new schools are being built in Glasgow alone. And always - with every piece of bad news - the new parliament is held accountable.</p> <p>\"There is a real schizophrenia in this country,\" says Frank McAveety MSP, the deputy minister for local government. \"The Scottish press corps lobbied harder than anyone for a devolved parliament, now they've got it, they're queuing up to give it a good kicking.\"</p> <p>For many observers of the Scottish scene - Billy Connolly for instance - there is nothing new in this symptom of a split national personality. In the new Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow's Exchange Square, it is there for all to see. Housed in a glorious legacy from the city's mercantile past, the gallery is full, not of the art of a self-confident, newly semi-independent country, but of gloom and pessimism. Albeit producing fascinating, visually arresting work, young Scottish artists seem obsessed with national shortcomings, failure and self-loathing. In their view everything appears to be wrong with Scotland, from its housing to its way with sex. The misanthropic whole is summed up by Ron O'Donnell's brilliant painting featuring a man bedecked in tartan, sitting in a room decorated with the memorabilia of plastic patriotism. He is slumped in an armchair, can in hand, watching the big match on television. Instead of a head he has a football. The painting is called The Scotsman.</p> <p>\"I think that painting's got it right: football really is an important metaphor for Scottish life, not least because we are so obsessed with it,\" says Sandy Ross, managing director of Scottish Television. \"For instance, you can't ignore the effect the 1978 World Cup had on the collective psyche. We went there saying we could beat the world and we were humiliated as only we Scots can be. I reckon Andrew Marr was right when he said this sense of 'we're crap and we know we are' which resulted from that campaign completely destroyed any chance of devolution the last time it was on the cards in 1979. We simply thought we weren't up to it.\"</p> <p>And if it isn't football, it's Thatcher. The 80s were a bleak time for Scotland, battered by recession, steam-rollered by brutalist economic theories, then spat on as the laboratory of the poll tax. For many in Scotland, it was easy to point the finger for failings. Though to be fair, it is not just paranoia: the English really do appear to have little concern for what goes on over the garden wall.</p> <p>\"Since I came to Scotland 10 years ago,\" says Gavin Stamp, senior lecturer at the McIntosh School of Architecture in Glasgow, \"I've become much more aware of English indifference to Scotland. I have friends who proudly tell me they have never visited Scotland in a way they would be ashamed to admit if they had never been to Paris.\"</p> <p>However justified, loathing of English control over a land for which there was minimal interest became endemic; the manner in which the Scottish Office doled out the money in an unaccountable fashion from Westminster was identified as the root cause of every evil visited on the country.</p> <p>\"The country became irresponsible, plagued by a moaning, defeatist culture,\" says Andrew Jaspan, editor of the Herald on Sunday newspaper. \"Every problem was blamed on London.\"</p> <p>Blame: an important word in the Scottish vocabulary.</p> <p>\"Oh yes, we're always looking for someone to blame,\" says Sandy Ross. \"The New Labour honeymoon was far shorter up here. We were already suspicious that Blair would desert us long before he was even elected.\"</p> <p>For the Scottish politicians who arrived after devolution in 1999, getting to grips with blame is part of the new job description.</p> <p>\"The Thatcher years distorted politics in Scotland,\" says Frank McAveety. \"It made it easy. We could all agree we hated her and she was to blame for everything. Now that's all over, there is a much more difficult job: deciding what we stand for and whether we can do it.\"</p> <p>Not that there is a general faith abroad that the parliament is the body to sort much out at all. It is hard to find anyone - unless they are employed by Holyrood - who has a kind word to say about the new Scottish political institutions. If there is any feeling at all for the parliament on the streets, it is the one neatly summarised by Billy Connolly who calls it a \"wee pretendy parliament\". Yet for some observers, the very fact Scotland at last has a parliament to sneer at is a major step forward.</p> <p>\"We may have a mess now with all this summer's cock-ups,\" says Andrew Jaspan, \"but at least it's Scotland's mess. For years it's been easy to say it's someone else's fault. Now people have to face up to it. And I think that's brilliant.\"</p> <p>Jaspan points to the debate about Section 28 as a perfect example of what he calls a \"growing-up process\" instigated by the arrival of the parliament.

      "bodyText": "At least the members of the Scottish parliament got the important legislation out of the way early. Last year, on the historic first day of sitting, the newly elected members of the newly devolved institution agreed on the following: that they should all receive a bronze commemorative medal to mark their role in history. Exhausted by the legislative process, they then took a two-month holiday. Though not before deciding it would be a fine idea to commission a \u00a3200m building in which to conduct their future activities. Tomorrow, when they start their second year in business, the members of the Scottish parliament will have a somewhat more rigorous agenda. Over the summer, the political news has made alarming reading for them. Take these headlines from the Daily Record, Scotland's biggest-selling daily paper, last Wednesday: \"Beleaguered ministers careers take turn for the worse; exam chaos spreads; waiting lists soar; union chiefs threaten autumn of discontent\". Meanwhile, Alex Salmond, the leader of the SNP, the official opposition party, has been spending the summer telling everyone who will listen that, technically, the Scottish economy is about to enter recession: receipts are below expenditure, imports above exports, with economic growth too low to mop up the difference. As birthday messages to mark the second year of devolved government go, the Scottish parliament could hardly have chosen a less complimentary one: much of the superficial evidence suggests this is a country which cannot rule itself. In truth, walking round the streets last week, Scotland does not look on the verge of economic collapse. Edinburgh in particular, with its endless new bars and restaurants and a housing market approaching London levels of ludicrousness, looks in rude economic health. In Glasgow, too, the buoyant central business district is full of busy corporations such as Scottish Power, Scottish Widows and Scottish Gas, whose nomenclature identifies them firmly with the sort of self-confident nationalism which would be reckoned business suicide south of the border. And, since everyone living outside the central belt is always quick to point out that Glas gow and Edinburgh are not the real Scotland, it seems advisable to report that business-wise things are pretty cheery elsewhere too. \"Shell has just announced a big increase in investment up here,\" says Amanda Harvie, of the Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce. \"Without wishing to suggest we are approaching boom times, I'd say there was overall an upturn in confidence at the sharp end. That is not to pretend there are not real challenges ahead.\" As its defenders would point out, it is the challenges that the Scottish parliament has been set up to address. Success can get on by its own, it is failure that needs sorting out by government. And - impending recession or not - Scotland has enormous challenges beyond an apparent inability to mark examination papers properly. Bad health, bad housing, bad diet and drug abuse are endemic. It is a nation, too, identified by division: north/south; east/west; Lowland/Highland; rural/urban. Many of the divisions are even enshrined constitutionally: this is a country which still legislates to ensure Catholics and Protestants are educated separately. And it doesn't seem as if its globally expansive corporations are keen to help. As Stagecoach, Scottish Media and Scottish Power colonise the corporate world with a voracity to match their empire building forebears, they seem to have all but forgotten the local community from which they draw their wealth and expertise. In the past, Scottish business success was characterised by huge public projects (Andrew Carnegie was the typical Scottish philanthropist). Now success is marked by the size of directors' remuneration. Tellingly, the lottery-funded Museum of Scotland which has just opened to great acclaim in Edinburgh, is the only grand cultural building to be built in this grandest cultural city in the last century. Unless you count Murrayfield. Still, in case it may have forgotten the many challenges it faces, the Scottish parliament can always rely on its media to remind it. In an over-crowded newspaper market, Scottish papers seem to have decided that bad news sells. For his own political reasons, Andrew Neil has ensured his Scotsman keeps its teeth never far from the jugular. Even the traditionally Labour-supporting Daily Record has administered almost daily assaults on Donald Dewar and his team since the moment they took office. The failures of the examination system or fears of impending recession are given far greater prominence than the revelation that 29 new schools are being built in Glasgow alone. And always - with every piece of bad news - the new parliament is held accountable. \"There is a real schizophrenia in this country,\" says Frank McAveety MSP, the deputy minister for local government. \"The Scottish press corps lobbied harder than anyone for a devolved parliament, now they've got it, they're queuing up to give it a good kicking.\" For many observers of the Scottish scene - Billy Connolly for instance - there is nothing new in this symptom of a split national personality. In the new Gallery of Modern Art in Glasgow's Exchange Square, it is there for all to see. Housed in a glorious legacy from the city's mercantile past, the gallery is full, not of the art of a self-confident, newly semi-independent country, but of gloom and pessimism. Albeit producing fascinating, visually arresting work, young Scottish artists seem obsessed with national shortcomings, failure and self-loathing. In their view everything appears to be wrong with Scotland, from its housing to its way with sex. The misanthropic whole is summed up by Ron O'Donnell's brilliant painting featuring a man bedecked in tartan, sitting in a room decorated with the memorabilia of plastic patriotism. He is slumped in an armchair, can in hand, watching the big match on television. Instead of a head he has a football. The painting is called The Scotsman. \"I think that painting's got it right: football really is an important metaphor for Scottish life, not least because we are so obsessed with it,\" says Sandy Ross, managing director of Scottish Television. \"For instance, you can't ignore the effect the 1978 World Cup had on the collective psyche. We went there saying we could beat the world and we were humiliated as only we Scots can be. I reckon Andrew Marr was right when he said this sense of 'we're crap and we know we are' which resulted from that campaign completely destroyed any chance of devolution the last time it was on the cards in 1979. We simply thought we weren't up to it.\" And if it isn't football, it's Thatcher. The 80s were a bleak time for Scotland, battered by recession, steam-rollered by brutalist economic theories, then spat on as the laboratory of the poll tax. For many in Scotland, it was easy to point the finger for failings. Though to be fair, it is not just paranoia: the English really do appear to have little concern for what goes on over the garden wall. \"Since I came to Scotland 10 years ago,\" says Gavin Stamp, senior lecturer at the McIntosh School of Architecture in Glasgow, \"I've become much more aware of English indifference to Scotland. I have friends who proudly tell me they have never visited Scotland in a way they would be ashamed to admit if they had never been to Paris.\" However justified, loathing of English control over a land for which there was minimal interest became endemic; the manner in which the Scottish Office doled out the money in an unaccountable fashion from Westminster was identified as the root cause of every evil visited on the country. \"The country became irresponsible, plagued by a moaning, defeatist culture,\" says Andrew Jaspan, editor of the Herald on Sunday newspaper. \"Every problem was blamed on London.\" Blame: an important word in the Scottish vocabulary. \"Oh yes, we're always looking for someone to blame,\" says Sandy Ross. \"The New Labour honeymoon was far shorter up here. We were already suspicious that Blair would desert us long before he was even elected.\" For the Scottish politicians who arrived after devolution in 1999, getting to grips with blame is part of the new job description. \"The Thatcher years distorted politics in Scotland,\" says Frank McAveety. \"It made it easy. We could all agree we hated her and she was to blame for everything. Now that's all over, there is a much more difficult job: deciding what we stand for and whether we can do it.\" Not that there is a general faith abroad that the parliament is the body to sort much out at all. It is hard to find anyone - unless they are employed by Holyrood - who has a kind word to say about the new Scottish political institutions. If there is any feeling at all for the parliament on the streets, it is the one neatly summarised by Billy Connolly who calls it a \"wee pretendy parliament\". Yet for some observers, the very fact Scotland at last has a parliament to sneer at is a major step forward. \"We may have a mess now with all this summer's cock-ups,\" says Andrew Jaspan, \"but at least it's Scotland's mess. For years it's been easy to say it's someone else's fault. Now people have to face up to it. And I think that's brilliant.\" Jaspan points to the debate about Section 28 as a perfect example of what he calls a \"growing-up process\" instigated by the arrival of the parliament. The debate was an ugly, divisive one. The bus billionaire Brian Souter bankrolled a campaign against its abolition which quickly ran out of control. Posters suggested that if Section 28 was removed from the statute books, buggery would become part of the syllabus. With the willing endorsement of the Catholic church and parts of the Church of Scotland, the anti-abolitionists whipped up a virulently homophobic fervour. \"A lot of people said that the debate over Section 28 was a disaster,\" says Jaspan, \"but I reckon it was probably the best debate Scotland's had for years. It challenged a lot of people who assumed we were a tolerant, liberal society to really look at themselves and defend the issues.\" Gordon Macdougall, the political editor of Scottish Television, agrees. \"A lot of my English friends told me that the Section 28 business showed what a backward, ugly nation we really were,\" he says. \"But at the end of it, Section 28 has been abolished up here and it is still on the statute books down south.\" For all its symbolic importance, however, Section 28 was still, in essence, an intellectual issue.

      "bodyText": "Man on the Moon... You might assume that after skipping gaily through lunar craters and the Sea of Tranquility, the dusty corridors of London's Imperial College would seem strangely parochial. Dull even. Still, odd though the juxtaposition may be, that's exactly where you'll find erstwhile rock-hopping astronaut Buzz Aldrin this week, as he pitches up in the UK to appear at the Annual Festival of Science, being opened by Princess Anne at Imperial tomorrow afternoon. Appearing at the festival alongside the slightly less exotic likes of Tom Baker, Richard Dawkins and Beryl Bainbridge, Aldrin - forever known as the guy a couple of steps behind the guy taking a giant leap for mankind - will then be In Conversation at the Royal Geographic Society on Thursday evening, before jetting back to his presidency of (no lie) Starcraft Enterprises, Laguna Beach, shortly afterwards. Happy days are here again... Oh, and if should you notice a black cloud of eternal grumpiness hanging over you at any point in the near future, that'll be venerable art-rock icon Lou Reed. Having already played shows in Birmingham and Bristol in support of his comically titled new album Ecstasy, the ever-jovial Reed is in London this very moment, preparing to play the Shepherd's Bush Empire tonight. After disappearing - no doubt in a puff of transcendental joy - for another week, he then returns to these shores to play Portsmouth a week Thursday. All of which, coincidentally, means he may well run into the collective genius of unhinged pop maestros Ween as he wanders through customs, what with Gene, Mean and Dean arriving to play the Astoria on Thursday, where they will no doubt be airing selections from their latest opus, White Pepper.",

      "body": "<p>In late summer, in a long shed of a studio whose skylight lets in a slice of fresh sky, David Batchelor is enthusing about traffic lights. The green light isn't green, he says, it's more blueish. He's fiddling in a forest of cables tangled around the base of some steel shelves. On them stand metal boxes of the kind that contain \"exit\" signs in the cinema. These are abandoned commercial lightboxes that he has scavenged from skips and derelict shops. In each he has mounted a fluorescent light, and across the front he has fixed coloured panes of plastic. He switches it on and a seductive polychromatic light illuminates the chaotic space. Suddenly we are in a dream version of Piccadilly Circus or Times Square - a fantasia of modern urban colour. Electrified colours dance off each other; magenta, lime, amber. </p> <p>Batchelor's Electric Colour Tower is a romantic monument to the modern city. Towers are the nuttiest architectural genre. From the Tower of Babel to the Watts Towers, which the untrained artist Simon Rodia built out of bits of wire and glass in South Central Los Angeles between 1921 and 1954, towers have been associated with folly, with hubris, and with the delight of building for its own sake. Batchelor's Electric Colour Tower immediately makes you think of such unnecessary architecture. It is gratuitous; who needs it? </p> <p>Electric Colour Tower looks like a rough design for a skyscraper in a brightly lit Blade Runner city. Erected to the height of three floors at Sadler's Wells, London, as part of the theatre's programme of public art commissions, this is a rare thing: a contemporary art work that tries to give unalloyed pleasure. Batchelor believes conceptual art, the tradition in which he was trained, has become a repressive, joyless bar to visual delight. Electric Colour Tower is, he says, his \"revenge\" on conceptualism. </p> <p>If so, it is a revenge from within rather than from without, more a case of the system being mutated than destroyed. David Batchelor's art negotiates sensual pleasure and conceptualist irony, perhaps too knowingly at times in his previous work. It quotes several modern traditions. In the first place there's monochrome painting, the painting of 60s artists such as Robert Ryman, Yves Klein and their imitators. Batchelor originally trained as a painter and, as you contemplate these sheets of glowing colour, it strikes you that he has found a way to paint by other means. All around his studio are sketches of coloured geometric shapes, fragments of coloured plastic and photographs of what he identifies as ready-made monochromes - painted white boards that he spots on his rambles around London back streets, faded signs that have turned into modernist paintings. He takes pictures of them and exhibits them as examples of the accidental art we see every day. </p> <p>This quoting of traditions might seem a bit precious. Although Batchelor sees himself as subverting the high tradition of modern art, there is definitely some name-checking going on. He made a big impact a couple of years ago in an exhibition called Here and Now at London's Lisson Gallery, in which he exhibited a series of flat, low trolleys used for moving heavy objects he found discarded around King's Cross station. In the metal beds of these trolleys he put pools of gorgeous colour - blue, pink and yellow. They can be seen as horizontal, monochrome paintings on ready-made supports, dialogues between the world of art and the city streets. Students loved them and Batchelor is a cult figure for a young London art scene in which uninhibited visual pleasure has made a comeback. </p> <p>Batchelor's explorations of colour in his art have gone along with his own art-historical research. He has just written a book, Chromophobia, about what he sees as the deadly hostility to colour in the modern western world. His sumptuous celebration of sensory experience in the Electric Colour Tower is in fact conceived as an answer to this anti-sensual, anti-pleasure tradition that he claims to identify. </p> <p>Chromophobia, or fear of colour, runs through 20th-century high culture, he says, from Le Corbusier calling for all surfaces to be painted white in his 1925 manifesto The Decorative Art of Today, to the empty white spaces of modern loft interiors. Contemporary art is too often a snobbish accessory of the perfect white interior, a prissy conceptualist gesture in colourless space. Outside the white cube gallery, the city is all synthetic colour and artifice, all impurity. But inside the gallery, art is not taken quite seriously unless its colours are muted and its exuberance contained. This goes well beyond art, argues Batchelor. He cites the way calling someone in public life \"colourful\" - he quotes obituaries for Alan Clark - is to imply a tragic flakiness. Batchelor gets really angry about the western world's history of chromophobia. It is, he argues, related to homophobia, not to mention other fears - of the east, of cosmetics, of femininity. </p> <p>But there is also a history of delirious uninhibited colour in European art, from the rich purples and greens of frescoes in Pompeii to the painted wooden sculpture in late medieval churches to Matisse's odalisques and Lucio Fontana's luxury monochromes. The question is: how does Batchelor's theory shape his own art? </p> <p>It is unusual to find a contemporary artist whose art is openly engaged with art-historical ideas. But Batchelor's work is a delicious demonstration that thinking things through is healthy. </p> <p>One idea that runs from his monochrome trolleys to his latest work is that people don't understand the minimalist art of the 60s; far from being a pristine art for white cube galleries - the realisation of Le Corbusier's purist dream - the art of minimalists such as Donald Judd and Dan Flavin was an attempt to vindicate everyday materials and participate in the energy of the modern city. It was closely related to its contemporary New York movement, pop art. And the minimalists revelled in colour: Judd, as you can see in his works in Tate Modern, juxtaposes blue Perspex and steel, red enamel and copper, with a stylishly restrained hedonism. </p> <p>You can see this idea echoing through Batchelor's art and determining the discreetly flamboyant form of his Electric Colour Tower. In structure, this is a minimalist stack. The lightboxes are piled neatly one over the other in a potentially endless escalation. But they are all different sizes, and the wires show, and the materials are obviously battered and second-hand. Unlike the cool minimalism that, so the myth goes, can only function in a white space gallery, the Electric Colour Tower bears the signs of its origin in the city streets, in the piles of junk where Batchelor finds his materials. The light of this art is heavenly, it takes you out of yourself, and yet it reminds you constantly that it is no different from the lights you see flickering and flashing all around the city by night, the lights of kebab shops and ambulances. </p> <p>Electric Colour Tower is a lovely folly, a dive into the city's world of synthetic colour. In the 20th century electricity and the chemical industry combined to make countless new colours available to the human eye: glowing reds, flickering blues, shiny greens.

He painted his visions with meticulous excess, detailing every dermatological oddity, every horticultural flourish, with extravagant accuracy. But he was also, less famously, a deviser of fantastical entertainments at the Hapsburg court, which is why his name has been given to the huge dance spectacle with which Jiri Kylian celebrates his retirement after 23 years as artistic director of Nederlands Dans Theater (NDT). </p> <p>The scale of Arcimboldo 2000, at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, is certainly grandiose, combining all three NDTcompanies; and it's also contrived as a surreal homage to the eccentricities of its namesake. As soon as we enter the theatre, black-suited \"ushers\" accost us with gibbering gestures, while a scarlet-frocked woman licks a pianist's skull. Pre-performance tours also take us backstage where dancers from the company pose like Arcimboldesque portraits. In one dark corner an angelic young man holds a stuffed peacock to his loins, while a woman stands in a drift of dead birds, holding a budgie to her mouth like a lace handkerchief. </p> <p>These possess a kind of shop-window charm but their wit isn't developed once the company take to the stage. Arcimboldo 2000 (actually a rewrite of a show conceived three years ago) is a collage of new and old choreography, glued together with some slackly-realised fun and farce. The first section is presented as a prelude to a feast, with four dancers seated in expectation of a meal, much as we in the audience await the show. This might have developed into a neat conceit (court ballets often took place around feasting) had it not been realised in a manner so grimly suggestive of a senile Marcel Marceau. No sooner has the triumphal opening music got under way than the dancers launch into a caper of restaurant mayhem, waving their cutlery around in perky unison and ending up with their plastic cups clown-wise on their noses. </p> <p>Humour has never been Kylian's strong point. In a later dance, three performers are accompanied by video images of themselves which subversively shrink, swell and get snagged on deviantly staccato rhythms. The effect is mildly diverting but palls after a few minutes. Other sections of the show stick to pure dance and some remind us how good Kylian can be. One piece for five men generates effects as transforming as any of Arcimboldo's most extraordinary trompes l'oeil, with the movements flickering so fast through the limbs of the dancers that the men appear like fabulous fish or birds. Later, when Kylian gathers together a mass chorus, the texture and detail in his choreography ar as fierce as that of the renaissance wizard's most brilliant brushstrokes. </p> <p>But such moments are occasional highlights in a work that's too long and lazily organised. It's a harsh thing to say about anyone's leaving party, but the aimlessness apparent in Arcimboldo is typical of the recent malaise that's afflicted the company's artistic policies. Kylian has, indisputably, built NDT into a world class company, and his performers are among the finest in Europe. Right now, though, it looks as if he himself needs to concentrate on making dances, and allow his successor at NDT to inject new vigour into the company's direction.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's three weeks later. I'm more tired than I knew it was possible to be. The baby has been wrestled into a lunchtime nap, and I'm lying on my bed wondering if I have the energy to go to the National Childbirth Trust reunion. If I do, I'll have to tell my birth story - again.</p> <p>Not that anything terrible happened. Actually, in the strange, masochistic world of natural childbirth, I may have scored maximum points. I had a water birth, complete with low lighting, sympathetic midwives and supportive husband. In fact, I have the material to be positively triumphalist - I happen to know that of all the women in my group, I was the only one who did not have medical intervention.</p> <p>Ironically, I was also the only woman who did not go active birth classes (I've never liked gym). I must admit to feeling a bit gleeful about the last detail - but not about the rest. I'm glad I had a water birth, but don't think it indicates any special virtue on my part - I think it is more likely to be the result of genetics and substantial hips. Nor am I surprised that the other women had intervention.</p> <p>The NCT is a middle class institution, and full of women coming to motherhood after having had established careers. Not only did most of my classmates probably look nice in jeans, but they were mostly over 30, and therefore likely to need help. I know that some of the women there this afternoon will try to apologise for \"failing\" to have an \"active\" birth, and that seems absurd. I wish I had a T-shirt that said: \"I think modern obstetrics are great.\"</p> <p>In fact, now my mind is so full of naps, nappies, crying and feeds, I wonder why we put so much emphasis on the birth in the first place. I understand why the natural birth movement had to happen - the over-medicalised, paternalistic births of the 50s and 60s were repressive and even cruel - but radical reactions are always full of over-statement. When Sheila Kitzinger claimed in 1962 that natural child birth using her \"psychosexual\" method \"has a significance for both man and woman which reaches far beyond the act of birth itself, and through the family has its effect upon society as a whole\", did she really expect it to become the orthodoxy?</p> <p>Because orthodox it certainly is.

      "bodyText": "It's three weeks later. I'm more tired than I knew it was possible to be. The baby has been wrestled into a lunchtime nap, and I'm lying on my bed wondering if I have the energy to go to the National Childbirth Trust reunion. If I do, I'll have to tell my birth story - again. Not that anything terrible happened. Actually, in the strange, masochistic world of natural childbirth, I may have scored maximum points. I had a water birth, complete with low lighting, sympathetic midwives and supportive husband. In fact, I have the material to be positively triumphalist - I happen to know that of all the women in my group, I was the only one who did not have medical intervention. Ironically, I was also the only woman who did not go active birth classes (I've never liked gym). I must admit to feeling a bit gleeful about the last detail - but not about the rest. I'm glad I had a water birth, but don't think it indicates any special virtue on my part - I think it is more likely to be the result of genetics and substantial hips. Nor am I surprised that the other women had intervention. The NCT is a middle class institution, and full of women coming to motherhood after having had established careers. Not only did most of my classmates probably look nice in jeans, but they were mostly over 30, and therefore likely to need help. I know that some of the women there this afternoon will try to apologise for \"failing\" to have an \"active\" birth, and that seems absurd. I wish I had a T-shirt that said: \"I think modern obstetrics are great.\" In fact, now my mind is so full of naps, nappies, crying and feeds, I wonder why we put so much emphasis on the birth in the first place. I understand why the natural birth movement had to happen - the over-medicalised, paternalistic births of the 50s and 60s were repressive and even cruel - but radical reactions are always full of over-statement. When Sheila Kitzinger claimed in 1962 that natural child birth using her \"psychosexual\" method \"has a significance for both man and woman which reaches far beyond the act of birth itself, and through the family has its effect upon society as a whole\", did she really expect it to become the orthodoxy? Because orthodox it certainly is. My classmates will be apologising because they have to some extent accepted Kitzinger's idea that natural childbirth will somehow put everything else, especially breast-feeding, right. \"Immediately after the birth, the baby will be passed to you for bonding,\" says my hospital leaflet. \"Once you've achieved successful suckling in the celebratory atmosphere that surrounds birth, you will feel confident about future feeding\" asserts Miriam Stoppard, a main-stream authority if ever there was one. My water birth gave me a strong feeling of having given birth to my son and I value the experience. But it wasn't magic.

      "body": "<p>Britain was the source of $123m (\u00a384m) of Nigerian public assets laundered by Nigeria's former military dictator, General Sani Abacha, through Swiss banks during the 1990s, Switzerland's banking regulator said yesterday. </p> <p>It had been assumed that funds allegedly embezzled in the world's largest case of political corruption were sent from Nigeria to countries with tight banking secrecy regulations in an effort to conceal their origin before they reached mainstream financial centres like London or New York. </p> <p>But an investigation by the Federal Banking Commission into the handling of Abacha assets by 19 banks in Switzerland shows that almost one-third of the $660m frozen here came from banks in Britain and the US. </p> <p>At least $213m was also transferred from Swiss bank accounts to Britain during the 1990s, according to the banking commission's report. Other destinations included Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and the US. Britain is considering a formal request from Nigeria to freeze Abacha accounts. </p> <p>The commission said six banks had violated money laundering guidelines and due diligence requirements by ignoring the origin of the funds or the \"politically exposed\" nature of their clients, including three within the Credit Suisse group - Credit Suisse Private Banking, Bank Hofmann and Bank Leu. Others were Union Bancaire Priv\u00e9, and the Swiss subsidiaries of the French bank, Credit Agricole-Indosuez, and MM Warburg of Germany. </p> <p>In most cases they dealt directly with Sani Abacha's sons, Ibrahim and Mohammed. </p> <p>Two board members and a manager have been forced to leave MM Warburg under the regulator's pressure. \"We were clearly under the impression that the people at the top there had to leave - at board and management levels,\" Daniel Zuberbuehler, the banking commission's secretary said. Other dismissals are expected. </p> <p>The Swiss have also notified French, German and Luxembourg regulatory authorities of the identities of other bankers who have now left Switzerland. </p> <p>Senior Credit Suisse staff are said to have escaped disciplinary measures mainly because most of the managers that dealt with Abacha funds have left the bank.

      "bodyText": "Britain was the source of $123m (\u00a384m) of Nigerian public assets laundered by Nigeria's former military dictator, General Sani Abacha, through Swiss banks during the 1990s, Switzerland's banking regulator said yesterday. It had been assumed that funds allegedly embezzled in the world's largest case of political corruption were sent from Nigeria to countries with tight banking secrecy regulations in an effort to conceal their origin before they reached mainstream financial centres like London or New York. But an investigation by the Federal Banking Commission into the handling of Abacha assets by 19 banks in Switzerland shows that almost one-third of the $660m frozen here came from banks in Britain and the US. At least $213m was also transferred from Swiss bank accounts to Britain during the 1990s, according to the banking commission's report. Other destinations included Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and the US. Britain is considering a formal request from Nigeria to freeze Abacha accounts. The commission said six banks had violated money laundering guidelines and due diligence requirements by ignoring the origin of the funds or the \"politically exposed\" nature of their clients, including three within the Credit Suisse group - Credit Suisse Private Banking, Bank Hofmann and Bank Leu. Others were Union Bancaire Priv\u00e9, and the Swiss subsidiaries of the French bank, Credit Agricole-Indosuez, and MM Warburg of Germany. In most cases they dealt directly with Sani Abacha's sons, Ibrahim and Mohammed. Two board members and a manager have been forced to leave MM Warburg under the regulator's pressure. \"We were clearly under the impression that the people at the top there had to leave - at board and management levels,\" Daniel Zuberbuehler, the banking commission's secretary said. Other dismissals are expected. The Swiss have also notified French, German and Luxembourg regulatory authorities of the identities of other bankers who have now left Switzerland. Senior Credit Suisse staff are said to have escaped disciplinary measures mainly because most of the managers that dealt with Abacha funds have left the bank. CS was also able to prove that it had tightened up its internal procedures. Six other banks have received a reprimand. \"The fact alone that significant funds of dubious origin from the close entourage of the former Nigerian president, Sani Abacha, were deposited in Swiss bank accounts, is disturbing and damaging to the reputation of Switzerland's financial sector,\" said Kurt Hauri, the commission's chairman. \"The financial centre and Switzerland have no interest in attracting assets that stem from corruption.\" The commission said it would lobby for minimum international banking standards on the handling of funds from \"potentates\".

Globalresident.com, set up by two former bankers, has targeted the financial community in search of accommodation in Central London. Properties available on the website range from \u00a311,000 a week for Mayfair apartments to \u00a3150 a week, for something a little less salubrious. The company was set up after co-founder Sumir Bhardwaj had problems finding somewhere for his family to move to in central London. \"Everyone who is renting can relate to the fact that there are real inefficiencies in the market, there's a business problem that needs to be fixed,\" he said. The company claims it overcomes problems of slow searching and scant choice faced by other such sites. The system allows users to perform fast detailed searches and arrange viewings through its web-based messaging system, the company said. The site provides photographs of properties and brief details of facilities provided. Mr Bhardwaj and co-founder Jason Kushner left jobs at investment bank Merrill Lynch at the end of February and believe their business is unique because it focuses on rental properties in London. \"We are going to have one of the largest selection of quality rental properties in London.

Several mobile handset manufacturers are thought to be interested in formatting the Liverpool-based publisher's games for their next generation devices. Judging by the crush to get into the Rage stand at the ECTS trade show in London yesterday, several others are keen. Recent acquisitions have bedded down and, if anything, the foundations of the company are in better shape than at the start of the year. The US deal yesterday helped Rage shares up 3% to 26.5p. Recovery prospects make them a long term buy.",

In a joint statement with the Liberal Democrats, it said the UN security council should be enlarged to include Germany, Japan and representatives from Latin America, Africa, and Asia, joining the US, Russia, China, Britain, and France, as permanent members. The joint statement from the Labour and Liberal Democrat joint consultative committee reflects the government's enthusiasm for intervening and its frustration at failing to secure international support. After pointing to the 1994 Rwanda genocide and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, and seizing on last year's statement by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, that \"no legal principle - not even sovereignty - can shield crimes against humanity\" it said: \"Our two parties believe profoundly that it is no longer acceptable at the beginning of the 21st century that massive human rights violations and genocide go unchallenged.\" In what they called a \"framework for intervention\" they stated: \"When a government has shown that it is palpably unwilling or unable to cope with an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe, we believe that the international community has a duty to intervene.\" They added: \"The use of force must be collective and only in exceptional circumstances should it be undertaken without the express authority of the security council of the United Nations.\" Challenges in the statement to existing notions of sovereignty were echoed yesterday by the international development secretary, Clare Short. \"The old idea of national sovereignty, of being an island unto yourself _ is gone.

But the principle that intervention in a country's sovereign affairs could be justified on humanitarian or human rights grounds is unlikely to be accepted by China if only because of Taiwan and Tibet. Russia, faced with Chechen demands for independence, is also unlikely to welcome it. Yesterday's statement conceded that UN reforms, including circumstances in which the UN's existing principle of sovereignty could be challenged, would require the unanimous agreement of the current five members of the UN security council. The UN's inability to mount speedy and effective military and civilian peacekeeping operations - shown up in Sierra Leone and Kosovo - must be addressed by developing \"standby arrangements\" and better UN training and leadership programmes. \"No longer must UN 'blue helmets' stand by while the most serious crimes against humanity are being committed,\" it said. The joint statement urged all countries to ratify the statute setting up an international criminal court (opposed by the US), the international conven tions against torture and racial discrimination, and the treaty outlawing landmines. It proposed a decommissioning body to control the destruction of small arms - responsible for more than 80% of casualties in modern warfare.

      "bodyText": "Emperor Hirohito was not the unworldly figurehead and reluctant warrior that he was painted by Japanese and western leaders after 1945, a new American book claims. Rather, he was a much more enthusiastic supporter of expansionism and military aggression than it suited either Japanese or American interests to acknowledge, then or since. From the end of the second world war until his death in 1989, the American historian Herbert Bix writes, Hirohito was at the centre of an assiduous effort to present him as a remote leader who bore no personal responsibility for Japan's war aims and deeds, against China in the 1930s and the US and its allies in 1941-45. This version of history is little more than myth, he says. Hirohito's role in defining, urging and supporting Japanese war aims, and the active part he played as commander-in-chief of the armed forces in wars which cost the lives of 20m Asians and more than 3m Japanese, make him \"the central symbol of his people's repression of their wartime past\". In Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan Mr Bix argues that \"secrecy, myth and gross misrepresentation\" surrounded the emperor, above all in the attempts to depict him as a constitutional monarch with little direct role in policy making, and in the creation of the fiction that he was a pacifist who opposed the attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941 and was eager for a dignified surrender in 1945. Conservative Japanese and American cold-war interests converged in the effort to establish this version, the book argues. General Douglas MacArthur, who headed the US occupation after atom bombs were dropped on Japan in 1945, persistently argued to Washington that the emperor must remain on the throne if the US was ever to bring its forces home again. Much of the basis of the post-war myths, says Mr Bix, a professor at Hitotsubashi university in Tokyo, is in the \"Monologue\" on his wartime role which Hirohito dictated to MacArthur's aides in March 1946. It was not published until after Hirohito's death. He wrote that \"as a constitutional monarch under a constitutional government\" he \"could not avoid\" approving the decision to go to war. Elsewhere he described himself as \"virtually a prisoner and powerless\" in his dealings with \"the militarists\". But, Mr Bix writes: \"Hirohito omitted mention of how he and his aides had helped the military to become an enormously powerful political force pushing for arms expansion. \"He ignored the many times he and his entourage has made use of the Meiji system of government by consensus to stifle a more democratic, less militarised political process. \"He intentionally fudged the details about his role as both a military leader and a head of state, blurred his motives, and obfuscated the timing of his actions and the logic that informed them. \"He was silent too about how he had encouraged the belligerency of his people by serving as an active ideological focus of a new emperor-centred nationalism that had grown up around him.\" Hirohito was \"smarter and shrewder than most people gave him credit for\". Never was his cunning used more effectively than in the last 40 years of his life, when he became the only wartime enemy leader to retain his post and to be rehabilitated both at home and in the west. But the image of the remote poet-emperor and marine biologist which preceded his visits to Europe and the US in the 70s was classic spin doctoring. From late 1937 onward Hirohito became \"a real war leader,\" Mr Bix writes, influencing strategy and helping to appoint commanders. The history of his rule before 1945 is \"inextricably bound up with the history of Japanese militarism and fascism\". After 1945, \"it is connected to efforts by ruling elites to roll back [American] occupation reforms, check Japanese pacifism, and regain the attributes of a great-power state.\"",

The French accident investigation bureau (BEA) said the strip found on the runway appeared to come from the cowling of the fan reverser on the DC-10's right engine. Continental said the twisted, epoxy-coated strip was the same shape as a piece missing from the engine of flight COA 55. It was not there when officials of the airline, the BEA, the US federal aviation administration and the national transportation and safety board inspected the plane in Houston on Saturday, it said. The strip had been replaced on July 9 during a routine engine inspection. Because the investigation was continuing it was \"inappropriate to comment further,\" the company added. The French investigators' interim report published last week suggested that the strip probably caused a tyre to explode, sending heavy chunks of rubber into the unprotected wings and puncturing one or more of the fuel tanks. The resulting fire sent the plane plunging into a hotel, killing all 109 people on board and another four on the ground. A spokesman for A\u00e9roports de Paris, which runs Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, said yesterday that it was \"a little too simplistic\" to blame the crash on the postponement of a routine runway inspection due an hour or so before the Concorde took off. The BEA report said the inspection was delayed to allow time for a 35-minute fire drill, leaving the runway from which the Concorde took off unchecked for more than 12 hours. \"No one can say whether an inspection would have uncovered anything untoward,\" the spokesman, Didier Hamon, said. \"And if the firemen who were on the runway had seen a foreign object they would have recovered it or reported it.\" A pilot and BEA expert, Fran\u00e7ois Grangier, said the postponed inspection was unimportant from a technical viewpoint. \"Between each take-off you have six or seven aircraft crossing the runway,\" he said. \"Potentially, the risk of debris falling off is considerable.

The concession, coupled with a searing attack on Mr Putin's campaign to tame the free media, left the Kremlin confident that the two most important television channels in Russia and the most formidable sources of opposition were being brought to heel. In what was seen as a big victory for Mr Putin, who has made control of the media, particularly national television, a central plank in his campaign to entrench his political power, Mr Berezovsky said he was surrendering his 49% share of ORT, the main state television channel, to \"journalists and intellectuals\" after coming under intense pressure from the Kremlin and being presented with an ultimatum. In a letter to Mr Putin, leaked to the Interfax news agency, Mr Berezovsky said one of the president's most senior aides had told him he had a fortnight to get rid of the ORT shares. Mr Berezovsky alleged he was threatened with imprisonment if he continued to defy Mr Putin. While Mr Berezovsky stressed he was surrendering his shares into the care of ORT journalists, his letter appeared to be an admission of defeat, crowning a summer of media wars between the Kremlin and the two big national television channels. ORT, meaning \"public Russian television\", is the equivalent of BBC1 and the only Russian channel broadcasting to the entire country. Vladimir Gusinsky, Mr Berezovsky's rival and the owner of NTV, the country's biggest private channel, is in exile in Spain after being briefly jailed, having his offices raided, and being pressured to transfer control of the station to Gazprom, the gas monopoly which is acting as a proxy for the Kremlin. \"We share Berezovsky's concern for the future of the freedom of the press in Russia,\" Mr Gusinsky's Media-Most company said in a statement last night. In an outspoken attack a fortnight ago, Mr Putin accused both magnates of being liars and thieves and rounded on both stations for their coverage of the Kursk submarine tragedy. Mr Berezovsky's letter stressed that he was forced to surrender control of ORT, arguing that Mr Putin had confronted the public with \"a very important question - whether or not non-state mass media have the right to exist in Russia\". He said the Kremlin aide presented the ultimatum last week. \"I should either transfer my ORT shares to the state within two weeks or follow Gusinsky\" - he was obviously referring to prison.

Concern will be heightened by Besiktas being fined yesterday by Uefa for misbehaviour by their fans in a recent home Champions League qualifier, especially as the Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale revealed that 500 Turkish supporters would be given tickets for the potentially volatile match at Elland Road on September 26. Both clubs have pledged to ensure travelling fans are strictly vetted to weed out anyone with a criminal conviction. Leeds have also been assured that any fans travelling to Istanbul apart from on the club's official trip will be deported immediately. \"In our view anyone else who goes to Turkey with the intentions of watching the game without our supervision will not be there for the right reasons,\" said Ridsdale. \"As such we will be asking the authorities to send them straight home.\" The Yorkshire club have advised the FA of their plans after talks with the Foreign Office, West Yorkshire police and the families of Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, the two fans killed in Istanbul on the eve of Leeds's Uefa Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in April. The Besiktas president Serdar Bilgili will be a special guest at Elland Road tonight for the game against Manchester City before flying to Geneva with Ridsdale tomorrow for a meeting with Uefa's chief executive Gerhard Aigner at which they expect to have their proposals sanctioned. But immediate concerns about Leeds fans travelling to the 45,000-capacity Inonu stadium on October 18 were raised as Uefa fined Beskitas \u00a33,200 because fireworks were set off and missiles thrown in the qualifier against Levski Sofia. Rangers will take 250 fans to their Champions League game against Galatasaray on September 27. Only season-ticket holders and registered members of their supporters' clubs will be allowed.",

England's captain had admitted, with the final Test in the balance, to sleeping badly for weeks, but when he finally fell into an alcohol-induced slumber last night, the Wisden Trophy safely gathered in, all the indications were that he would not wake again for days. </p> <p>The moment that Hussain realised, in midsummer, that England had not beaten the West Indies for 31 years was the moment that he succumbed to obsession. His life became consumed by a single objective. Nothing else mattered. </p> <p>\"I felt that we had a wonderful opportunity to end that record, and I haven't thought about anything else for months,\" he said. \"I'm sorry if it sounds a little bit sad or cricket-nerdish but that's how it is. Now we've done it, I'm completely drained.\" </p> <p>Even yesterday afternoon, as a festive Oval crowd presumptuously awaited certain victory, Hussain's outward calm disguised his inner agitation. Call this a winning margin of 158 runs, but never in Hussain's earshot describe it as comfortable. </p> <p>\"When Lara and Sarwan were playing well in the afternoon, my heart began to beat a little,\" he said. \"Outwardly I had to stay calm, because there are always TV cameras and 10 other players looking at you and expecting you to seem settled. But with Lara around, you can never be sure. The difference between a 3-1 series win and finishing 2-2 is miles apart.\" </p> <p>In the three weeks' grace before England fly to Kenya for the ICC Trophy, Hussain will have a holiday (can someone make sure he does not pack his cricket videos?) and then work upon a batting technique in need of remedial action. He possesses the skill to bounce back quickly this winter. </p> <p>\"I've been overly tense, inwardly, and that has rubbed off on my batting,\" said. \"Even selection for this Test was so difficult. I knew there were good reasons not to play a spinner because the ball has swung at the Oval, and the West Indies have struggled against that this summer, but it was still a gamble and I spent six days worrying that it might turn out to be the wrong decision.\" </p> <p>For English cricket, this has been a summer of reawakening; for Hussain, a summer of sleep deprivation. In common with his team-mates, he expected the series's last gasp to be played out before a few thousand spectators. To find that many fans had been locked out was timely proof that he had not been alone in his longing. \"They are grateful for a side to take pride in,\" he said. </p> <p>Hussain has not been the only England captain to despair of Andy Caddick's highs and lows, but this summer the Caddick barometer has told time and again of fair weather ahead. </p> <p>\"The time that Andy Caddick got out of bed at Lord's and decided to bowl for us,\" Hussain identified as the turning point of the series. \"We bowled them out for 54 and that turned the series round. </p> <p>\"This series will help our self-belief. We had a chance of doing something very special this summer and we took it. Not all the series will be played on pitches like these, or against sides with the West Indies' particular batting weaknesses, but they are confident, and they are playing good cricket. </p> <p>\"We realise that the task ahead in Pakistan and Sri Lanka this winter is huge. We need to achieve when the wickets are flat. Perhaps the wheels will come off - who knows? </p> <p>Jimmy Adams, the West Indies captain, faces an enormous task. A side that had lost their previous 10 overseas Tests - in New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa - had again showed their fragility overseas. A forthcoming five-Test tour in Australia, with Curtly Ambrose retired, is a callous fixture programme. </p> <p>Adams is convinced that popular social theories of the gradual and irreversible decline of West Indian cricket, as the influence of the United States becomes ever stronger, have been overplayed. </p> <p>\"There is still so much talent in the Caribbean,\" he said. \"I'm convinced of that. The onus is on us to develop this talent more attentively over the next five years. There are more choices for youngsters than there were 20 years ago. </p> <p>\"We can no longer just sit around and expect the kids to come to us. The onus is upon West Indies cricket to motivate kids to play the game. The West Indies will come again.\"</p>",

Call this a winning margin of 158 runs, but never in Hussain's earshot describe it as comfortable. \"When Lara and Sarwan were playing well in the afternoon, my heart began to beat a little,\" he said. \"Outwardly I had to stay calm, because there are always TV cameras and 10 other players looking at you and expecting you to seem settled. But with Lara around, you can never be sure. The difference between a 3-1 series win and finishing 2-2 is miles apart.\" In the three weeks' grace before England fly to Kenya for the ICC Trophy, Hussain will have a holiday (can someone make sure he does not pack his cricket videos?) and then work upon a batting technique in need of remedial action. He possesses the skill to bounce back quickly this winter. \"I've been overly tense, inwardly, and that has rubbed off on my batting,\" said. \"Even selection for this Test was so difficult. I knew there were good reasons not to play a spinner because the ball has swung at the Oval, and the West Indies have struggled against that this summer, but it was still a gamble and I spent six days worrying that it might turn out to be the wrong decision.\" For English cricket, this has been a summer of reawakening; for Hussain, a summer of sleep deprivation. In common with his team-mates, he expected the series's last gasp to be played out before a few thousand spectators. To find that many fans had been locked out was timely proof that he had not been alone in his longing. \"They are grateful for a side to take pride in,\" he said. Hussain has not been the only England captain to despair of Andy Caddick's highs and lows, but this summer the Caddick barometer has told time and again of fair weather ahead. \"The time that Andy Caddick got out of bed at Lord's and decided to bowl for us,\" Hussain identified as the turning point of the series. \"We bowled them out for 54 and that turned the series round. \"This series will help our self-belief. We had a chance of doing something very special this summer and we took it. Not all the series will be played on pitches like these, or against sides with the West Indies' particular batting weaknesses, but they are confident, and they are playing good cricket. \"We realise that the task ahead in Pakistan and Sri Lanka this winter is huge. We need to achieve when the wickets are flat. Perhaps the wheels will come off - who knows? Jimmy Adams, the West Indies captain, faces an enormous task. A side that had lost their previous 10 overseas Tests - in New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa - had again showed their fragility overseas. A forthcoming five-Test tour in Australia, with Curtly Ambrose retired, is a callous fixture programme. Adams is convinced that popular social theories of the gradual and irreversible decline of West Indian cricket, as the influence of the United States becomes ever stronger, have been overplayed. \"There is still so much talent in the Caribbean,\" he said. \"I'm convinced of that. The onus is on us to develop this talent more attentively over the next five years. There are more choices for youngsters than there were 20 years ago. \"We can no longer just sit around and expect the kids to come to us. The onus is upon West Indies cricket to motivate kids to play the game. The West Indies will come again.\"",

Victory by 158 runs, achieved 12 minutes into the final session and in front of a full house on the fifth day of a Test for the first time in living memory, was as emphatic as it was sweet. Seeking to make an improbable 374 to win, from 33 without loss overnight, West Indies lost wickets steadily throughout the day against the ebullient England pace attack, led thrillingly once more by Darren Gough, who finished with three for 64, and Andy Caddick, four for 54. Those two shared seven of the first eight wickets before stepping aside for Dominic Cork to finish it off with two wickets in three balls. Only while Brian Lara was at the crease did West Indies harbour even a minuscule hope of achieving the win they needed to level the series. But he was leg-before, unluckily perhaps, to Gough for a brilliant 47, and that effectively was that. West Indies, to put things in perspective, had fallen short of their victory target by precisely the number of runs Mike Atherton and Marcus Trescothick had put on for the first wicket of the match after Jimmy Adams had put England in. Twenty minutes after the stumps had been grabbed and the England team had sprinted off, Nasser Hussain, finally, lifted the Wisden Trophy to mass acclaim on the same balcony where last summer he was booed after defeat by New Zealand. Hussain has led the side with increasing authority this summer but he is level-headed enough to know that once the celebrations have died down there is work to be done. By the time they reach the Oval again 12 months hence England will have played winter series in Pakistan and Sri Lanka and home series against Pakistan once more and Australia.
