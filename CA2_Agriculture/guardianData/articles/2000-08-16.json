      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee is capable of springing a surprise on the City even when it behaves precisely as expected. Earlier this month, the committee left interest rates on hold. </p> <p>The jolt for the market came yesterday when minutes of the meeting showed not only that rates were left on hold by the narrowest of margins, but also that some of those in favour of \"no change\" acknowledged that the call was close. </p> <p>Interest rate hawks immediately interpreted the fine balance over the decision as a sign that rates have still to peak. Others seized on the latest earnings and employment data as evidence that events were moving in the direction that the MPC wanted and there was little reason for a change. </p> <p>In fact the figures can be argued either way. The claimant count last month was the lowest for more than 20 years, the percentage of the workforce unemployed and claiming benefit the lowest since 1975. Yet the earnings numbers - those most likely to worry the MPC while the rest of us are celebrating the buoyancy of the jobs market - appear benign. </p> <p>Back to the spoilsports, who point out that, while headline earnings numbers for June showed a fall, the so-called negative bonus effect meant the figures flattered, perhaps to deceive. Forget the new economy - if the unemployment rate continues to fall it will feed through into higher earnings which in turn will stoke up consumer spending which is what really worries the MPC. </p> <p>The problem for the committee is that it has little or no control over two of the key determinents of inflation - the level of sterling and the price of oil. The latter is bobbing around a 10-year high and, according to some analysts, could spike higher. Nor will the foreign exchange market's view of the appropriate value of the pound necessarily correspond with MPC inflation forecasts. </p> <p>The MPC may not be too unhappy to have caught the City on the hop. If it can massage expectations towards the possibility of a rise in the repo rate to 6.25% or even 6.5% that may have a helpful knock-on effect on market rates. It would also mean that, if a rise were deemed necessary, it may have less impact on the politically sensitive sterling/euro exchange rate than if it came as a bolt from the blue. </p> <p><strong> Mutual benefits </strong><br> One factor which may have an impact on the consumer spending that haunts the MPC is the latest demutualisation windfalls. Policyholders with Scottish Widows are due to receive their share of the \u00a35.8bn windfall from the Lloyds TSB takeover. This could make official spending numbers tricky to read. </p> <p>The payout, a reminder of the short term gains of demutualisation, comes at an awkward time for another Scottish institution, Standard Life. Shortly after fending off one attempt to push through demutualisation it is coming under fresh pressure to turn itself into a plc and hand out large sums of money to policyholders. </p> <p>It appears there is little that Standard Life can do to prevent itself being confronted by a succession of demutualisa tion efforts until, either through weariness or boredom, policyholders opt for the cash. </p> <p>Introducing a rule that Standard Life could not be asked to consider demutualisation for (say) two or three years after the failure of a previous proposal could easily be overturned. </p> <p>Raising the numbers of members needed to back a demutualisation proposal might look a better bet but, in these days of the internet, it is hard to pick a number high enough to present an effective hurdle. </p> <p>Such a defence would, in any case, be wrong. Policyholders have voted, once, against demutualisation. </p> <p>That decision cannot be set in stone for ever. Provision must be made either for changes in circumstances or simply for a change of mind on the part of the policyholders. But there should be a decent interval in between. </p> <p><strong> Irish dilemma </strong><br> If the MPC is ever inclined to feel sorry for the difficulties it faces in making policy, members need do no more than look across to Ireland.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England's monetary policy committee is capable of springing a surprise on the City even when it behaves precisely as expected. Earlier this month, the committee left interest rates on hold. The jolt for the market came yesterday when minutes of the meeting showed not only that rates were left on hold by the narrowest of margins, but also that some of those in favour of \"no change\" acknowledged that the call was close. Interest rate hawks immediately interpreted the fine balance over the decision as a sign that rates have still to peak. Others seized on the latest earnings and employment data as evidence that events were moving in the direction that the MPC wanted and there was little reason for a change. In fact the figures can be argued either way. The claimant count last month was the lowest for more than 20 years, the percentage of the workforce unemployed and claiming benefit the lowest since 1975. Yet the earnings numbers - those most likely to worry the MPC while the rest of us are celebrating the buoyancy of the jobs market - appear benign. Back to the spoilsports, who point out that, while headline earnings numbers for June showed a fall, the so-called negative bonus effect meant the figures flattered, perhaps to deceive. Forget the new economy - if the unemployment rate continues to fall it will feed through into higher earnings which in turn will stoke up consumer spending which is what really worries the MPC. The problem for the committee is that it has little or no control over two of the key determinents of inflation - the level of sterling and the price of oil. The latter is bobbing around a 10-year high and, according to some analysts, could spike higher. Nor will the foreign exchange market's view of the appropriate value of the pound necessarily correspond with MPC inflation forecasts. The MPC may not be too unhappy to have caught the City on the hop. If it can massage expectations towards the possibility of a rise in the repo rate to 6.25% or even 6.5% that may have a helpful knock-on effect on market rates. It would also mean that, if a rise were deemed necessary, it may have less impact on the politically sensitive sterling/euro exchange rate than if it came as a bolt from the blue. Mutual benefits One factor which may have an impact on the consumer spending that haunts the MPC is the latest demutualisation windfalls. Policyholders with Scottish Widows are due to receive their share of the \u00a35.8bn windfall from the Lloyds TSB takeover. This could make official spending numbers tricky to read. The payout, a reminder of the short term gains of demutualisation, comes at an awkward time for another Scottish institution, Standard Life. Shortly after fending off one attempt to push through demutualisation it is coming under fresh pressure to turn itself into a plc and hand out large sums of money to policyholders. It appears there is little that Standard Life can do to prevent itself being confronted by a succession of demutualisa tion efforts until, either through weariness or boredom, policyholders opt for the cash. Introducing a rule that Standard Life could not be asked to consider demutualisation for (say) two or three years after the failure of a previous proposal could easily be overturned. Raising the numbers of members needed to back a demutualisation proposal might look a better bet but, in these days of the internet, it is hard to pick a number high enough to present an effective hurdle. Such a defence would, in any case, be wrong. Policyholders have voted, once, against demutualisation. That decision cannot be set in stone for ever. Provision must be made either for changes in circumstances or simply for a change of mind on the part of the policyholders. But there should be a decent interval in between. Irish dilemma If the MPC is ever inclined to feel sorry for the difficulties it faces in making policy, members need do no more than look across to Ireland. There the economy is roaring ahead but inflation this week hit a 15-year high. At 6.2% it is more than double the euro-zone average. The government has already frozen the price of booze and now the unions would like it to do the same with petrol duty and VAT. The International Monetary Fund thinks it would do better to raise taxes. Hardly the best background for negotiating a national wage pact. The problem for Dublin's economic policymakers is that there is little they can do. Cutting indirect taxes would have a one-off effect but would give consumers extra spending power. An IMF style tightening is reckoned to have limited impact. At least the MPC gets to set interest rates.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Don Juan </strong> Royal Lyceum *****</p> <p> Drama and dance often make uneasy bedfellows. But Mats Ek's production of Don Juan, brought to Edinburgh by Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre, choreographs a classic text with rare brilliance: Ek uses the skills he acquired with the Cullberg Ballet Company to give Moli\u00e8re's study of an atheistic seducer a prodigious, and highly erotic, physical life. </p> <p>Ek highlights the theatricality of the play throughout. Mikael Persbrandt's imposing Don Juan is not just an arithmetic bed-hopper but a fetishistic role-player: he dons a black wig when in seductive mode and, in flight, becomes a masked, sombrero-clad Zorro. Maria Geber's design deploys romantic landscape panels that ironically evoke a vanished pictorialism. And, at the climax, the hero is hoisted up to the top of a reversed flat, as if impaled by his own love of theatricality. </p> <p>But what makes Ek's production startlingly different from other Don Juans is its transformation of actors into dancers. Persbrandt and Nina Togner Fex's Dona Elvira at one point do a sexually charged pas de deux. Niklas Ek's ageing Sganarelle is not just the voice of virtue but a formidable athlete who slides horizontally across a table like a fast-moving parcel. And the Don's female victims are given a head-inclined, lateral style of movement as if their natural equilibrium had been destroyed by the hero's assaults. </p> <p>The miracle of Ek's production is that it gives the play a vividly choreographed energy without losing its philosophical arguments. Persbrandt's impressive Don Juan becomes a narcissistic nihilist who tries on any role he fancies: a god-defying seducer, a masked avenger, even a fashionable social hypocrite. But Ek emphasises the character's sheer nastiness in the scene where he offers a beggar money in payment for blasphemy and then kicks the purse just out of his reach; and when Sganarelle lectures his master on the fantastic nature of mankind, the hero slumps in front of a television set. </p> <p>Ek uses any number of devices to highlight his theme that Don Juan is really a man on the run terrified of any lasting relationship. Best of all, he casts the actress who plays Dona Elvira as the indigent beggar, a male creditor and even as Elvira's brother to emphasise the point that the supposed libertine is in reality a haunted, hunted man. You could object that Ek sometimes ignores the letter of Moli\u00e8re's text: the peasant girl, Charlotte, whom Don Juan pursues, here becomes a provocative, bum-wiggling cleaner. But Ek captures the spirit of the play superbly, in particular its portrait of the spiritual emptiness of self-enraptured egotism. </p> <p>Above all, Ek's production combines physical exhilaration with serious fun. There's a lovely moment when Sganarelle, as part of Moli\u00e8re's sidewipe at the medical profession, turns himelf into a fraudulent shrink analysing his genuinely disturbed master. A great play has been rethought and turned into an ironic commentary on our modern belief in passionless hedonism and fluctuating identity.

The next Premiership television deal is worth around \u00a32 billion but the bulk of that is expected to go on wages and transfers, mainly to foreign clubs, resulting in even less revenue for football league clubs who once relied on the sale of players to balance the books. </p> <p>The no-win situation many of the country's less fashionable clubs find themselves in meant that in 1998/99 only five of 72 football league clubs registered an operating profit, compared to 14 of 20 Premiership clubs. </p> <p>The bulk of money within the game will continue to be spent on wages and transfers. In 1998/99 English clubs spent \u00a3316.9m on transfers, compared to \u00a3227.9m the season before. \u00a3142.2m (compared to \u00a370m the season before) went abroad while the Premiership spent \u00a327.5m on transfers from Nationwide League clubs. </p> <p>Boon warned that it was becoming increasingly hard for First Division clubs to secure promotion to the Premiership. Top-flight clubs will earn \u00a323m a year from the new television deal while a First Division club will receive \u00a313.5m.

This morning Ferguson should have been enjoying an emotional reunion with those team-mates from whom he was reluctantly parted 20 months ago; instead he is staring an uncertain future in the face because of his failure to make one brief phone call. Ferguson was scheduled to arrive in the north-west at noon yesterday to undergo a medical before completing his transfer back from Newcastle United. But, to the astonishment of Everton officials and the disgust of the club's manager Walter Smith, the 28 year-old Scot failed to show up. Even more damaging was the player's failure to phone either Smith or Everton's chief executive Michael Dunford to offer an explanation or excuse for his non-appearance. Smith immediately indicated that his two-month pursuit of Ferguson was at an end - news which will hardly have been welcomed on Tyneside. As Everton's medical team awaited his arrival, Ferguson was at St James' Park making one last attempt to persuade Newcastle that his brief stay at the club merited the payment of a loyalty bonus - believed to be about \u00a3750,000. Ferguson is believed to have stayed in the north-east on Monday night before training with his Newcastle team-mates yesterday morning. His plan was then to hold one final round of talks with members of his club's hierarchy in the belief that he could convince them he should be given a cash settlement to help speed his departure back to Everton. Ever since Everton's interest in him first surfaced last month, Ferguson has argued that as he has never indicated a desire to leave Newcastle he should be entitled to the payment, in full, of bonuses which would have accrued had he stayed to see out the remaining three years of his contract. Newcastle's board of directors - seemingly to a man - were unmoved by Ferguson's plea for a handout, insisting he had spent insufficient time on Tyneside to warrant any bonus. When he was controversially sold to Newcastle in November 1998 for \u00a38m, Ferguson collected about \u00a31m in bonuses and signing-on fees. During what has been a rather unproductive 21-month spell in the north-east during which he has made only 24 Premiership starts, Ferguson has been paid more than \u00a335,000 a week, making him one of the highest-paid players in British football. However, despite Smith's sense of outrage, Everton's desperation for a striker of proven ability is such that the deal may yet be resurrected. Smith has spent most of the summer seeking to sign a competent forward after being informed that Kevin Campbell would definitely miss the opening few weeks of the new season after knee surgery almost five months ago. Smith ran the rule over several men - including Blackburn's Ashley Ward - before informing his club's majority shareholder, Bill Kenwright, he wished to re-sign Ferguson. If Ferguson was this morning to abandon his attempts to squeeze more money out of his current employer, and then apologise to his prospective future employer, he might still find himself lining up in a blue shirt when Everton's season opens against Leeds United at Elland Road on Saturday. Everton assumed that the closure of the deal was little more than a formality after they had agreed terms with Newcastle - an initial down-payment of \u00a33.75m with an additional \u00a31.25m after Ferguson had featured in a specified number, believed to be 60, of first-team games.

Unless Gascoigne stays fit and out of trouble, Smith's reputation will be damaged. </p> <p>Now, his efforts to bring Duncan Ferguson back from Newcastle, albeit unsuccessful, have raised similar questions about his judgment. Going back, when everything has changed in your absence, rarely works, in football or any other walk of life. It usually ends in anti-climax; legends can only lose their lustre. Nor does the fact that Smith was interested in Ferguson say much for what is currently available in the market place. </p> <p>This is not to argue that the club of Dixie Dean and Tommy Lawton should not employ a target man. Nor is it to question the tactical acumen of Smith, even though experience should have told him that, when Ferguson was at Goodison Park, everything was played to him and that his return would signal a miserable return to route one football, an approach most supporters despised and something the club appeared to have evolved beyond with Kevin Campbell last season. </p> <p>No, it is none of these things. It is to argue that going back, hankering after history, does not work unless all the other ingredients are the same. Usually they are not. Worse still, it betrays a measure of panic, conveys the notion that to travel backwards is better than not moving at all. </p> <p>Howard Kendall, who twice returned to Everton as manager after his period of outstanding success in the 1980s, might have given Smith some useful advice. </p> <p>Ferguson was Everton's last hero, a memory that could only have been tarnished, just as countless other players have had their reputations rewritten by untimely returns to the clubs that made them famous when managers with no vision have fallen back on their memories. </p> <p>It can be generally said that going back does not work for boxers, for racing drivers or for cricketers, as Graham Gooch would ruefully confirm after his unhappy return to first-class cricket this season. And it certainly does not work for footballers. </p> <p>Since the hindsight of fans endows great players with even greater qualities than they originally possessed, those who return must be better than they originally were if they are to be judged successful. Few sportsmen can live up to the raised level of expectation. </p> <p>Surely the Everton manager was not indulging in a piece of crude, William Hague-style populism. He is too good a manager for that. Besides, Everton supporters were split down the middle about whether a Ferguson return would have been a good thing for the club. </p> <p> Good luck to Walter Smith. He is a likeable fellow and he has much on his plate at a club which, since finishing sixth in 1995-96, has come 15th, 17th, 14th and 13th in the past four seasons. </p> <p>He has had a busy summer and made a number of promising signings. But, if he sees Everton's future in their recent, modest past, he and the Gwladys Street faithful who for once did not have to worry about the prospect of relegation last season are in for a bitter disappointment. </p> <p>If Smith cannot see that, he would deserve to see not only Ferguson but Peter Johnson back at Goodison Park.</p>",

Howard Kendall, who twice returned to Everton as manager after his period of outstanding success in the 1980s, might have given Smith some useful advice. Ferguson was Everton's last hero, a memory that could only have been tarnished, just as countless other players have had their reputations rewritten by untimely returns to the clubs that made them famous when managers with no vision have fallen back on their memories. It can be generally said that going back does not work for boxers, for racing drivers or for cricketers, as Graham Gooch would ruefully confirm after his unhappy return to first-class cricket this season. And it certainly does not work for footballers. Since the hindsight of fans endows great players with even greater qualities than they originally possessed, those who return must be better than they originally were if they are to be judged successful. Few sportsmen can live up to the raised level of expectation. Surely the Everton manager was not indulging in a piece of crude, William Hague-style populism. He is too good a manager for that. Besides, Everton supporters were split down the middle about whether a Ferguson return would have been a good thing for the club. Good luck to Walter Smith. He is a likeable fellow and he has much on his plate at a club which, since finishing sixth in 1995-96, has come 15th, 17th, 14th and 13th in the past four seasons. He has had a busy summer and made a number of promising signings. But, if he sees Everton's future in their recent, modest past, he and the Gwladys Street faithful who for once did not have to worry about the prospect of relegation last season are in for a bitter disappointment. If Smith cannot see that, he would deserve to see not only Ferguson but Peter Johnson back at Goodison Park.",

      "body": "<b>J Swan</b> <br>I deplore the whingey British sniping which has taken pleasure in running down the dome. Typical dog-in-the-manger stuff. It's just an excuse for the Daily Mail to have a pop at a Labour government and shouldn't be encouraged. Most people who have been seem to have really enjoyed it. <p><b>DMcV</b><br>Down, Swan! The Dome is a Tory idea. If the Daily Mail is daft enough to snipe at it, so be it. Their poodles built it. </p> <p><b>PY Gerbeau</b><br>With regard to the Tory idea, I am a businessman, not a politician, and truly believe that politics and business do not match. </p> <p><b>SysOut</b><br>The expo is also having trouble in Hanover getting visitors. Do you see any connection between the difficulties of Eurodisney, dome and Expo?</p> <p><b>PY Gerbeau</b><br>SysOut - one more time, a business that should have been driven by experts of the tourism and attraction industry and not by politicians. Are they ever going to learn?</p> <p><b>DeVise</b><br>Un Dome finance par les impots et dirige par des hommes d'affaires! Quel idee! Voici surement la troisieme voie dont M Blair est si fier. Ni le marche libre des Etats-Unis, ni l'intervention socialiste... Bravo!</p> <p><b>Alex Whiley</b><br>Does the French media rubbish France's \"grands projets\" in the same way as the British media does? To what extent do you blame the media for the mixed success of the dome?</p> <p><b>PY Gerbeau</b><br>AlexWhiley, I think this is not a question of British and non-British media. It is more the fact that the dome has been and still is a huge political football, and that people have different agendas all with the same objective - knocking it down. It is very frustrating for me and for the team, since we have fixed the product, the business and the organisation. So now, we are at the middle of a big dichotomy, which is the financial problems from the previous business plan and the lean, successful, commercial operation and great popular success that the dome is today.</p> <p><b>Mpcrossley</b><br>If the failure of the dome prior to your timely intervention were due to financial problems, then to what extent is this \"great popular success\" due to your team's management initiatives and how much is due to being bailed out by the National Lottery? </p> <p><b>PY Gerbeau</b><br>The financial situation has nothing to do with the popular success. Actually it is an argument to knock it down again. </p> <p>To clarify what you call a \"bail out\" from lottery money, I went only once to the commission, my banker, to demonstrate that the original business plan was entirely wrong and that was it! </p> <p>Since then, we are receiving the legacy receipt, which is the money that was always coming to the company from the sale of the business. That was factored in the original business plan, so there is absolutely nothing new. </p> <p>Why don't you come over and test out for yourself why this is now a great popular success?</p> <p><b>HannahB74</b><br>In former creative director Stephen Bayley's words, is the dome's image \"irredeemably mired\"?</p> <p><b>PY Gerbeau</b><br> About Stephen Bayley, let me pass...</p> <p><b>Bauhaus1</b><br>Hand on heart, what do you think are the weak points of the dome and how would you have done it better yourself if you'd been involved from the outset?</p> <p><b>PY Gerbeau</b><br>Bauhaus1, I am actually dreaming every night to be able to put the clock back and it be October 1 1999.</p> <p><b>Morcheeba</b><br>If you had had \u00a3750m to spend on something to mark the millennium, do you think you would have built a dome?</p> <p><b>PY Gerbeau</b><br>It is not only building a visitor attraction.

      "bodyText": "J Swan I deplore the whingey British sniping which has taken pleasure in running down the dome. Typical dog-in-the-manger stuff. It's just an excuse for the Daily Mail to have a pop at a Labour government and shouldn't be encouraged. Most people who have been seem to have really enjoyed it. DMcV Down, Swan! The Dome is a Tory idea. If the Daily Mail is daft enough to snipe at it, so be it. Their poodles built it. PY Gerbeau With regard to the Tory idea, I am a businessman, not a politician, and truly believe that politics and business do not match. SysOut The expo is also having trouble in Hanover getting visitors. Do you see any connection between the difficulties of Eurodisney, dome and Expo? PY Gerbeau SysOut - one more time, a business that should have been driven by experts of the tourism and attraction industry and not by politicians. Are they ever going to learn? DeVise Un Dome finance par les impots et dirige par des hommes d'affaires! Quel idee! Voici surement la troisieme voie dont M Blair est si fier. Ni le marche libre des Etats-Unis, ni l'intervention socialiste... Bravo! Alex Whiley Does the French media rubbish France's \"grands projets\" in the same way as the British media does? To what extent do you blame the media for the mixed success of the dome? PY Gerbeau AlexWhiley, I think this is not a question of British and non-British media. It is more the fact that the dome has been and still is a huge political football, and that people have different agendas all with the same objective - knocking it down. It is very frustrating for me and for the team, since we have fixed the product, the business and the organisation. So now, we are at the middle of a big dichotomy, which is the financial problems from the previous business plan and the lean, successful, commercial operation and great popular success that the dome is today. Mpcrossley If the failure of the dome prior to your timely intervention were due to financial problems, then to what extent is this \"great popular success\" due to your team's management initiatives and how much is due to being bailed out by the National Lottery? PY Gerbeau The financial situation has nothing to do with the popular success. Actually it is an argument to knock it down again. To clarify what you call a \"bail out\" from lottery money, I went only once to the commission, my banker, to demonstrate that the original business plan was entirely wrong and that was it! Since then, we are receiving the legacy receipt, which is the money that was always coming to the company from the sale of the business. That was factored in the original business plan, so there is absolutely nothing new. Why don't you come over and test out for yourself why this is now a great popular success? HannahB74 In former creative director Stephen Bayley's words, is the dome's image \"irredeemably mired\"? PY Gerbeau About Stephen Bayley, let me pass... Bauhaus1 Hand on heart, what do you think are the weak points of the dome and how would you have done it better yourself if you'd been involved from the outset? PY Gerbeau Bauhaus1, I am actually dreaming every night to be able to put the clock back and it be October 1 1999. Morcheeba If you had had \u00a3750m to spend on something to mark the millennium, do you think you would have built a dome? PY Gerbeau It is not only building a visitor attraction. It's also regenerating a derelict, polluted site. And creating thousands and thousands of new jobs. Turning non-skilled people into service experts. The good news is we proved now in the last six months that there was a viable and sustainable business for the dome as a visitor attraction. rubenruben M Gerbeau: there have been a lot of unkind comments about the actual role you held at Eurodisney. Come clean now - were you really just in charge of the car parks? PY Gerbeau Fact: I have been a kind of success story inside the Eurodisney organisation. I actually got promoted five times in six years. And yes, inside my multiple responsibilities in running the Eurodisney theme park was the management of an 11,000-space car park. Fortunately, I had competent management in the field because I would be, I am sure, a very poor car park attendant. KennyGee Don't you think the recent sheep TV ad campaign was likely to drive away as many people as it attracted? It was almost admitting that your product wasn't all that good. PY Gerbeau Being a practical marketeer, I've implemented very strict measurables and quantifiables to measure the impact of the new TV ad. The reservations to our call centre raised by more than 35% since the ad was shown. I agree with you it is controversial, but this is exactly what we needed to convince people because the challenge now is to get people to come to the dome and as soon as they are inside we know they will have a fantastic day. DMcV New offers for the \"summer\" were headlined a week or two ago. When, in fact, Scottish schoolchildren had already been on holiday for over a month. This underlines what we always suspected: that the dome is really an ephemeral fun palace for the south-east, but subsidised by all. PY Gerbeau To give you precise numbers, usually 2% of the Scottish population comes to London for a visit. Since the dome is here, 4% of Scottish people came to enjoy the unique experience. That is just one example of the internationality of the dome. ABC123 Hello PY. What are you going to do when you lose your job at the end of the year? Or are you going to be involved in the Japanese theme park project? What do you think should have happened to the dome after this year? Couldn't you have brought some French influence to bear and got it preserved like they did with the Eiffel Tower? PY Gerbeau I am sure I will find another big challenge and something to fix somewhere in the world. Meanwhile I would love to stay in the UK, because I did appreciate the great support from most people that I have met around the dome. I have to go but thanks for your comments.",

Pritchard says most child murderers are in a parental role. \"In the UK in the two years 1996-97, 110 children were killed. Just 19 were killed by a stranger. And for every child homicide, four children are killed in traffic accidents on the roads.\" </p> <p>He explains: \"We know that most child sex abuse of a damaging kind takes place in families, often poor families.

      "body": "<p><strong>GORDON'S GROUNDHOG DAY</strong></p> <p>Yesterday morning Gordon Strachan woke up to find things eerily repeating themselves. He wrestled a hairbrush through his ginger locks just as he had the year before. He sat down at his breakfast table and ate three Shredded Wheat, just as he had the year before. He picked his nose with the little finger of his right hand, just as he had the year before. And then he went out and spent over \u00a36m on a young, pacy forward with international caps who was too good for the First Division, just as he had the year before. How weird do you want?</p> <p>The cause of this burp in the space-time continuum is Craig Bellamy, the Welsh Robbie Keane as they're already calling him (and if they're not, what are they doing?). The 21-year-old was set to sign for Coventry from Norwich City today for a reported fee of \u00a36.5m. \"We've agreed a fee with the club and terms with the player and Craig is on his way to Coventry for a medical,\" Cov chairman Bryan Richardson said this morning. \"Gordon (Strachan) has had tabs on him for some considerable time and after speaking to several other people about the player to make sure, they all said 'go and get him, he's tops'.\"</p> <p>Apart from the fact that nobody on the entire face of the universe says \"go get him, he's tops,\" the Fiver can understand Richardson's excitement at landing Bellamy. He has scored 34 goals in 78 starts for the Canaries, and also notched the winner for Wales against Denmark in Copenhagen not too long ago. In fact, at the end of the 1999 season he was probably a hotter property than Keane himself. \"We fully expect Craig to do as well as Robbie, if not better,\" Richardson said today. And if that proves to be correct, Wee Gord can probably look forward to an eerily familiar call from an Italian giant next summer.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>WIN \u00a310,000 AND A TRIP TO THE BRAZILIAN CUP FINAL IN RIO</p> <p>Think you know about football?

Now it's the other way. What we need is a balance - as if it continues to go the way it's heading with players, I think football will blow itself up!\" Perhaps it was the uplifting power of the altar wine, but the Fiver couldn't help crying out a hearty \"Hallelujah\" at the power of his oratory. And we left happy, barely fearing the apocalypse because we knew that if it came there would always be a place for us by Pastor O'Leary's side.</p> <p>So imagine our shock when this afternoon we read that he had splashed out \u00a34.25m Liverpool's Dominic Matteo, and no doubt rewarded him with a hefty contract in the process! Of course Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale tried to smooth over our anger. \"He (Matteo) is a proven quality player within the Premiership, which means we are not gambling on whether he can fit into a Premiership team,\" he said. To which we responded: \"But he's not a regular first team player at Liverpool!\" \"He has played for the England B and U-21 international sides, so he has played beyond the Premiership level,\" was Ridsdale's rather innovative response to that.</p> <p>Now Pastor O'Leary has his eyes set on another miracle. Because after he described the deal for Monaco midfielder John Arne Riise as being \"dead\" this time last week, today it looked like it may be back on. Riise, in particular seems very keen, admitting: \"Leeds is still a club I want to play for, and I hope it works out. It's up to the clubs to agree a deal.

Warwickshire members used to moan when Bob Willis suddenly developed an extra yard of pace or three for England; David Gower treated the County Championship with about as much respect as Dean Jones treated Martin Bicknell in Australia in 1990-91; and Mike Atherton's views on county cricket make x-rated reading for chief executives throughout the land. </p> <p>But the current tug-of-love over Darren Gough between Yorkshire and England is a relatively new phenomenon, and is a direct result of the central-contracts system. England, eager to take on Pakistan with a fully refreshed pace attack, have ordered him to rest after the fifth and final Test against West Indies; Yorkshire, chasing their first title since 1968, would prefer Gough to play in the last two Championship games against Kent and Hampshire. And Gough himself? \"I'm sayin' nowt.\" For a man who likes to speak his mind, his silence is eloquent.</p> <p>Now the county game has been in thrall to the national side for a long time. Not only are county sides reliant on regular handouts from the ECB to prop them up, but the structure of the game has been fiddled with more times than Dermot Reeve's box. Four-day cricket, two divisions, changes in the bonus-points system - it's all been in the name of improving Team England. (Only when the members stomped and stamped and brought about the reinstatement of the B&amp;H Cup have the counties had their way. And look how that captured the public's imagination.)</p> <p>England does have to take priority over the counties, if only because international cricket attracts bigger crowds. There are those county members who would rather see their side win the Championship than England regain the Ashes, but in general most cricket lovers in this country are England fans first, and county fans second - if at all. England's pre-eminence is fine. The problem arises when they treat the counties with disdain.</p> <p>Duncan Fletcher wants Gough to be raring to go on the flat tracks of Karachi and Lahore.

      "bodyText": "The clash of county v country has been resonating for some years now. Warwickshire members used to moan when Bob Willis suddenly developed an extra yard of pace or three for England; David Gower treated the County Championship with about as much respect as Dean Jones treated Martin Bicknell in Australia in 1990-91; and Mike Atherton's views on county cricket make x-rated reading for chief executives throughout the land. But the current tug-of-love over Darren Gough between Yorkshire and England is a relatively new phenomenon, and is a direct result of the central-contracts system. England, eager to take on Pakistan with a fully refreshed pace attack, have ordered him to rest after the fifth and final Test against West Indies; Yorkshire, chasing their first title since 1968, would prefer Gough to play in the last two Championship games against Kent and Hampshire. And Gough himself? \"I'm sayin' nowt.\" For a man who likes to speak his mind, his silence is eloquent. Now the county game has been in thrall to the national side for a long time. Not only are county sides reliant on regular handouts from the ECB to prop them up, but the structure of the game has been fiddled with more times than Dermot Reeve's box. Four-day cricket, two divisions, changes in the bonus-points system - it's all been in the name of improving Team England. (Only when the members stomped and stamped and brought about the reinstatement of the B&amp;H Cup have the counties had their way. And look how that captured the public's imagination.) England does have to take priority over the counties, if only because international cricket attracts bigger crowds. There are those county members who would rather see their side win the Championship than England regain the Ashes, but in general most cricket lovers in this country are England fans first, and county fans second - if at all. England's pre-eminence is fine. The problem arises when they treat the counties with disdain. Duncan Fletcher wants Gough to be raring to go on the flat tracks of Karachi and Lahore. But even if Gough did turn out for Yorkshire after the Oval Test, he would still have over a month to recuperate before England take the field in Pakistan (even then it's only a warm-up game). Besides, Gough, whose increasingly occasional appearances for God's Own County are treated like the second coming by the Leeds faithful, would obviously like to give his adoring Yorkshire public something to cheer about. What about his wishes? How long will the Western Terrace continue to roar on their hero in a Test match when he's as elusive as Lord Lucan in the county games? Come to that, how long will they continue to roar on England at all if the decision to rest Gough costs Yorkshire the title? But there's a more important issue here. England want the county game to be a rampant breeding ground for Test cricket. But by denying Gough the chance to play for Yorkshire, they're not just missing the boat - they're falling over the quayside and performing a spectacular bellyflop as well.

It's a boy, called Rocco Ritchie, and he arrived last Friday, about a month early. We also know which side of the Atlantic Rocco was born on - and it wasn't ours. Madonna, 41, went to Los Angeles to have her second baby. </p> <p>\"So what?\" you might ask. Madge is a multimillionairess; she could afford to give birth on the moon if she wanted. But the crucial point is that Madonna, as they say in LA, has \"dissed\" our NHS. Just a few days before the birth, she was asked if she'd have the baby in Britain. \"Come on now,\" she objected. \"Have you been to the hospitals in England? They're old and Victorian.\" She added: \"I like efficiency.\" </p> <p>Many British hospitals are, indeed, \"old\". To an American, your average British hospital might well look alarmingly like something out of Oliver Twist. Tessa Keating, who had four of her five children in the States, says she was shocked when she first saw the British hospital where she was to give birth to her third child: \"It was like something out of a black and white film, totally prehistoric.\" And Tessa's English. </p> <p>So they're not pretty, but are they inefficient? Tessa says not, \"though the British antenatal system felt impersonal, my midwife throughout the birth was a dream\". In Britain you typically see your midwife or GP for monthly checkups, have a couple of routine scans at the hospital, and a midwife-led birth. After the birth you'll get midwife visits, then health visitors take over. Obstetricians tend to appear largely if things start going wrong. </p> <p>In America, the system is led by obstetricians. And you have to have health insurance before you even fantasise about chucking out the contraceptives. Insurance plans are complex, expensive and what they cover varies enormously. With most, you can only register with a doctor (an \"OBGYN\") from the insurance company's list. And, as Karen Allen, a Seattle OBGYN, puts it: \"Those with a good reputation tend to have full lists. Midwife-led births are still, in most cities, considered a little alternative.\" </p> <p>So is it all efficient in the US? For the insured, it certainly is. Once you're in it, the system is personal and thorough, and resources are plentiful. You can, for instance, have a scan whenever you want. </p> <p>Since you're going to rely on your OBGYN during the birth, a good relationship with her can be invaluable. Englishwoman Joanna Bayle had her baby, Nicholas, in New York 10 weeks ago. She says trust in her OBGYN was crucial: \"Every ache or complaint I had when pregnant was met with total understanding and attentiveness. She guaranteed to be there for the birth, and stayed at the hospital for the whole 16 hours of my labour.\" No over-stretched British obstetric consultant could possibly make such a promise. </p> <p>As for the hospital, Joanna found it \"new, slick looking. I had a private room afterwards, with a phone and a TV, and after my son was born, my OBGYN posted a pic ture of us on her website so that friends and family could log on and see how we were doing.\" </p> <p>Joanna wanted \"maximum pain relief\" and her anaesthetised experience was, she says, \"fantastic\". But for women who want a \"natural\" birth, US hospitals might be less wonderful. </p> <p>Sarah Butterworth, another Englishwoman in New York, had her first baby by home birth in Britain. When it came to having her second, though, she was in New York. She found an OBGYN and explained how easy and quick her first home birth had been. \"The doctor immediately suggested that I schedule an induction a week early because the birth might be even quicker this time and I might not make it to a hospital in time.\" </p> <p>So while the American system can be, as Tessa puts it, \"customer friendly\", with plush birthing rooms, attentive doctors and - if your health plan covers it - great resources, it can also be inflexible and, given the litigious nature of American society, highly interventionist (the caesarean rate stands at around 22%). </p> <p>Of course, we don't need a pop star to point out that British hospitals are under-resourced. Karlene Davis, general secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, certainly agrees that some British hospitals \"badly need investment\" and that midwives across the country often have to cope with \"difficult circumstances\". But then our system does have its benefits: not having to pay to give birth is quite handy, as is not paying \u00a3300 a month for family healthcare.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> I live with my husband George, who is 74, and my granddaughter Kezzie, 13. A few months ago I walked out on them both. We were all having dinner and, as usual, they were talking at me at the same time. George interrupts Kezzie because he's deaf and can't hear that she's in the middle of a story. Kezzie interrupts him when he interrupts her. </p> <p>That night I stood up with a glass of wine in my hand and said: \"If I leave home, you'll have to talk to each other.\" I went next door and introduced myself to a rather startled new neighbour. After half an hour I went back. They were both ashen-faced and very conciliatory. George had cleared the table, and Kezzie, who had got her maths books out, said: \"You must always say if you're feeling upset.\" </p> <p>My daughter Candy is a single mother, and when she decided to work for a degree we agreed that Kezzie should live with me. It's only in retrospect that I feel my own experience must have influenced me to help Candy as much as I could. I became a single mother when I was 17, and often left my baby son Patrick to cry while I worked as a waitress in the evening. I needed the money but I also hated staying in with him. I worked in one of the new coffee bars in the King's Road; it was fun. When Patrick was two, I sent him to live with my aunt in the country. I made infrequent visits. He didn't come back until I married George four years later. His muddled and unhappy early childhood contributed to his death of a heroin overdose when he was 25. </p> <p>Today I'm lucky: I have enough money for saxophone lessons, holidays and books; I have a nice house, a cottage in the country and a softy for a husband. More importantly, I now have time and patience. When I married George I had neither. </p> <p>Being a grandmother seems much easier than being a mother. There are none of those frantic evenings trying to get dressed glamorously while helping with the homework, sorting out a quarrel and searching for the gym kit. During the 1960s, when I had three children, I felt torn in so many directions and I was always tired. Nowadays, I don't much care what I look like: I sleep in a T-shirt, and spend the day in my pinny. </p> <p>My social life is dictated by having to get up early for the school run. I wouldn't leave Kezzie alone in the evening with only Latin homework and a fishfinger for company. I don't know how she feels about living with me, as opposed to living with Candy; I don't think she would like to be asked. One of her many qualities is loyalty: to me and to Candy. For her to admit to a preference either way would put her on the spot, but she certainly appreciates that her school is nearby and that therefore her friends are too. Also, Candy has a full-time job and gets home long after school finishes. </p> <p>Most weekends she spends with Candy; when I say: \"You're going to Mum's this weekend,\" she says: \"Oh, good.\" If I tell her she's staying with me, at least she doesn't pull a face as if she's been given an aubergine to eat. She isn't given the chance to play us off against each other. Candy and I are not a separated, quarrelling couple but mother and daughter, sharing her care. Candy often comes to my house for the night and we tell each other if there have been problems. We have a united front in the face of teenage demands. I wouldn't ring Candy at work with a long moan, and I have my ways of dealing with misdemeanours, such as when Kezzie does not get enough homework done because of watching too much TV. I have tried to be more easy-going than I was 35 years ago: sulks are best ignored; if tempers have been lost, we are better off in different rooms; and if she has been impossible I simply withdraw my friendship. </p> <p>But at 13 the hormones are buzzing; school is hard work, friendships are volatile. Also adolescents get depressed; these days I don't, so I have the advantage. </p> <p>Kezzie is also very loyal about George - but then she's always on the side of the underdog. She's the only one who hears me being snappy with him and will accuse me of shouting at him or not letting him win an argument. I point out that the \"wing-co\" as George calls me, is always right, and that shouting when the hearing-aid battery has faded is a necessity. </p> <p>She's quite proud of him, telling children to \"come and see my grandad. He's very famous and he has got psoriasis.\" Now that she is older they are finding things in common - not art, she dreads a lecture on that, but they both love horror stories, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and dirty jokes. </p> <p>George is not the only man in Kezzie's life: she has Uncle Tom, who took her to Disneyland Paris and failed to teach her maths; his son Django, the only small child she's ever liked; Candy's partner Mark, who plays video games with her; and most importantly, Bradley, her best friend and the boy next door.

      "bodyText": "I live with my husband George, who is 74, and my granddaughter Kezzie, 13. A few months ago I walked out on them both. We were all having dinner and, as usual, they were talking at me at the same time. George interrupts Kezzie because he's deaf and can't hear that she's in the middle of a story. Kezzie interrupts him when he interrupts her. That night I stood up with a glass of wine in my hand and said: \"If I leave home, you'll have to talk to each other.\" I went next door and introduced myself to a rather startled new neighbour. After half an hour I went back. They were both ashen-faced and very conciliatory. George had cleared the table, and Kezzie, who had got her maths books out, said: \"You must always say if you're feeling upset.\" My daughter Candy is a single mother, and when she decided to work for a degree we agreed that Kezzie should live with me. It's only in retrospect that I feel my own experience must have influenced me to help Candy as much as I could. I became a single mother when I was 17, and often left my baby son Patrick to cry while I worked as a waitress in the evening. I needed the money but I also hated staying in with him. I worked in one of the new coffee bars in the King's Road; it was fun. When Patrick was two, I sent him to live with my aunt in the country. I made infrequent visits. He didn't come back until I married George four years later. His muddled and unhappy early childhood contributed to his death of a heroin overdose when he was 25. Today I'm lucky: I have enough money for saxophone lessons, holidays and books; I have a nice house, a cottage in the country and a softy for a husband. More importantly, I now have time and patience. When I married George I had neither. Being a grandmother seems much easier than being a mother. There are none of those frantic evenings trying to get dressed glamorously while helping with the homework, sorting out a quarrel and searching for the gym kit. During the 1960s, when I had three children, I felt torn in so many directions and I was always tired. Nowadays, I don't much care what I look like: I sleep in a T-shirt, and spend the day in my pinny. My social life is dictated by having to get up early for the school run. I wouldn't leave Kezzie alone in the evening with only Latin homework and a fishfinger for company. I don't know how she feels about living with me, as opposed to living with Candy; I don't think she would like to be asked. One of her many qualities is loyalty: to me and to Candy. For her to admit to a preference either way would put her on the spot, but she certainly appreciates that her school is nearby and that therefore her friends are too. Also, Candy has a full-time job and gets home long after school finishes. Most weekends she spends with Candy; when I say: \"You're going to Mum's this weekend,\" she says: \"Oh, good.\" If I tell her she's staying with me, at least she doesn't pull a face as if she's been given an aubergine to eat. She isn't given the chance to play us off against each other. Candy and I are not a separated, quarrelling couple but mother and daughter, sharing her care. Candy often comes to my house for the night and we tell each other if there have been problems. We have a united front in the face of teenage demands. I wouldn't ring Candy at work with a long moan, and I have my ways of dealing with misdemeanours, such as when Kezzie does not get enough homework done because of watching too much TV. I have tried to be more easy-going than I was 35 years ago: sulks are best ignored; if tempers have been lost, we are better off in different rooms; and if she has been impossible I simply withdraw my friendship. But at 13 the hormones are buzzing; school is hard work, friendships are volatile. Also adolescents get depressed; these days I don't, so I have the advantage. Kezzie is also very loyal about George - but then she's always on the side of the underdog. She's the only one who hears me being snappy with him and will accuse me of shouting at him or not letting him win an argument. I point out that the \"wing-co\" as George calls me, is always right, and that shouting when the hearing-aid battery has faded is a necessity. She's quite proud of him, telling children to \"come and see my grandad. He's very famous and he has got psoriasis.\" Now that she is older they are finding things in common - not art, she dreads a lecture on that, but they both love horror stories, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and dirty jokes. George is not the only man in Kezzie's life: she has Uncle Tom, who took her to Disneyland Paris and failed to teach her maths; his son Django, the only small child she's ever liked; Candy's partner Mark, who plays video games with her; and most importantly, Bradley, her best friend and the boy next door. He's two years older and better than a brother: he fixes her computer, finds her shoes and never interrupts. What Kezzie and I share is a liking for a good story. She likes to know the plot of what I'm reading, and when she eventually reads Daniel Deronda, Framley Parsonage or The Woman in White, they will seem very familiar. I know how lucky I am. I love her company, I gave up smoking because of her and I think through her I was given another chance.",

But given that it is, some good should come out of it. If a family has a close member die, it is their right to decide whether any organs are donated.

But there is something not quite right about his smile. He is not OK. Indeed, it took over six months to get a placement in residential care and he has still not been provided with any legal advice about his future. Should he not fight for his rights? \"No,\" he says, shaking his head rigorously. \"Too scared. I should be grateful. Anyhow, I don't know what my rights are.\" </p> <p>Jon - not his real name - is one of a growing number of refugee children adrift in a care system that sometimes seems not to have their best interests at heart. \"Whether refugees are youngsters who become separated from their families in this country, or they are unaccompanied asylum seekers, few speak out about being mistreated by our care system. It's one of the reasons it is so rife,\" says Selam Kidane, newly- appointed refugee project consultant at British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering.

A staggering 41% of young refugees supported by London boroughs in October last year were housed in bed and breakfast accommodation, hotels or hotel annexes. </p> <p>\"Section 17 of the Children Act states that the local authority may provide accommodation in care for 16-21 year olds if it considers that it would safeguard or promote their welfare,\" says Pam Hibbert, the charity's principal policy officer. \"Clearly, refugees fall into this category, yet this is often missed.\" She adds: \"Since our report shows that many young people arrive with no paperwork, and assessments of their age are based on guesswork, it is safe to conclude that many under-16s are also excluded from care. Indeed, some fib that they're older, thinking it will get them greater rights. This, in turn, has implications for education and health care.\" </p> <p>Since 80% of refugees who arrive in this country are aged 16-18 - and the numbers of youngsters of all ages arriving in the UK is rising faster than ever - the Refugee Council claims this is no longer an issue we can afford to ignore. \"Resources and services for refugee children, as for any child in need, should be based on a full and holistic assessment of all their needs,\" says Judith Dennis, the council's unaccompanied children policy adviser. </p> <p>Kidane claims that a severe lack of available legal advisers, as well as interpreters and translators, is largely to blame for the inability of refugee children to fight against such inadequacies. \"We intend to call on the services of such people to create a forum of young refugees who will get their views heard by policy makers,\" she says. \"It won't be easy to recruit members - particularly those from countries with oppressive regimes who have learned not to speak at all - but we are determined. We see it as the only way in which we can turn around an ugly reality.\" </p> <p>The relentless negative press that refugees have received in recent months will no doubt prove a further obstacle, Kidane fears. The refugees do not feel supported and potential service providers, from foster carers to schools, become scared to offer their services for fear of causing unnecessary controversy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the audit commission's latest research warns that lasting improvements must be introduced urgently.

But there is something not quite right about his smile. He is not OK. Indeed, it took over six months to get a placement in residential care and he has still not been provided with any legal advice about his future. Should he not fight for his rights? \"No,\" he says, shaking his head rigorously. \"Too scared. I should be grateful. Anyhow, I don't know what my rights are.\" Jon - not his real name - is one of a growing number of refugee children adrift in a care system that sometimes seems not to have their best interests at heart. \"Whether refugees are youngsters who become separated from their families in this country, or they are unaccompanied asylum seekers, few speak out about being mistreated by our care system.

The sand here is a dark, sticky brown, turning to black at the lake's fringes. The smell is foul. </p> <p>On the far side, an abandoned Iraqi tank stands as a reminder of how this lake, in Kuwait's Burgan oilfield, and around 320 others like it, came into existence. During the Gulf war, occupying Iraqi forces released more than 60m barrels of oil on to the sands, forming lakes as deep as a swimming pool in places. </p> <p>Ten years on, they are still there. The Kuwaitis have pumped out a third of the oil, reducing the lakes to a shallow sludge. But the rest has sunk into the ground, five to six metres deep. As years go by, the oil continues to creep between the sand particles, contaminating more and more land. </p> <p>The Kuwaitis estimate that the cost of putting it right will be about $1bn, but oil-polluted earth has never been treated on this scale before and techniques are still in their infancy. A conference to discuss the options will be held in a few months. Dr Mohammed al-Sarawi, head of Kuwait's environment public authority, is hopeful that a Japanese bio-remediation method, which uses bacteria to break down the oil, will prove effective.

Even that is likely to be hazardous: there are still some Iraqi landmines in and around the lakes. </p> <p>It is not just a matter of restoring the land to its natural state: Kuwait's water supply is also affected, and several water wells have already been shut down because of oil seepage. </p> <p>Kuwait depends heavily on desalinated seawater, but it also uses fresh groundwater from the south, and adds some brackish groundwater to the distilled seawater to give it flavour. According to Green Cross, one aquifer representing 40% of the fresh water reserves has been contaminated. </p> <p>The oil lakes, together with the 720 oil wells set on fire at the end of the war, were partly aimed at damaging Kuwait's economy - a gesture of spite by the fleeing Iraqis. But oil was also used as a weapon. The Iraqis thought the allies might attempt a landing in Kuwait from the sea, and poured an estimated eight to 11m barrels into the sea as a deterrent.

During the war, the Iraqis drove a corridor across the desert from the north-west to the south-east, and the movement of hundreds of tanks broke up the surface.

The sand here is a dark, sticky brown, turning to black at the lake's fringes. The smell is foul. On the far side, an abandoned Iraqi tank stands as a reminder of how this lake, in Kuwait's Burgan oilfield, and around 320 others like it, came into existence. During the Gulf war, occupying Iraqi forces released more than 60m barrels of oil on to the sands, forming lakes as deep as a swimming pool in places. Ten years on, they are still there. The Kuwaitis have pumped out a third of the oil, reducing the lakes to a shallow sludge. But the rest has sunk into the ground, five to six metres deep. As years go by, the oil continues to creep between the sand particles, contaminating more and more land. The Kuwaitis estimate that the cost of putting it right will be about $1bn, but oil-polluted earth has never been treated on this scale before and techniques are still in their infancy. A conference to discuss the options will be held in a few months. Dr Mohammed al-Sarawi, head of Kuwait's environment public authority, is hopeful that a Japanese bio-remediation method, which uses bacteria to break down the oil, will prove effective.

The NHS plan means purchasers have a long shopping list for new equipment and new possibilities for streamlining processes using modern IT. </p> <p>Chief executive of the new NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency, Duncan Eaton, says the pressure to implement changes has intensified because of the plan.

The impact of this shortage is hard to quantify. Where procurement works well, it has an impact on both costs and the quality of patient care. In Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, good procurement combined with clinical expertise, generated savings worth \u00a3340,000 on pressure sore prevention and led to a 65% drop in demand for costly specialist beds. </p> <p>The head of procurement for the project, Keith Lilley, has now moved to Leeds University Teaching Hospitals, where he is working with nursing colleagues to apply the same principles. He explains: \"The first principle has to be that the price of goods is only one factor in the equation. Skilled purchasing involves understanding the clinical problems involved and applying commercial knowledge to work out what will deliver the outcome that really matters: the best patient care.\" </p> <p>In the case of pressure sore prevention, equipment is a major factor. Patients' risk is assessed on admission. Those at low risk need a good quality mattress, costing around \u00a3120; medium-risk patients need a more sophisticated, dynamic support system costing around \u00a32,500 a bed, and high-risk patients need special beds hired at around \u00a355 a day. </p> <p>The Sheffield scheme involved scrapping a rental system for medium-risk beds and investing \u00a3100,000 to buy the equipment for a hospital owned \"pool\". These beds were allocated around the hospital to wards that paid for them through an internal charging system. The \u00a3100,000 was repaid in 10 months, but the beds last for five years, yielding significant savings that are, in turn, being spent on buying quality mattresses for low-risk patients. </p> <p>The NHS plan pays particular attention to cancer equipment where procurement can make the difference between effective systems bought at an optimum price and less satisfactory outcomes. Equipment and service packages can differ by thousands of pounds and an apparently cheap machine may be expensive to run. </p> <p>In Leeds, the buying process is under way for new linear accelerators, machines used to deliver radio therapy to cancer patients. Many more will be bought nationally to meet the government's targets for re-equipment, but buying high-cost machinery is no job for a novice. Again, price is not the only consideration. In Leeds, the current shortage of radiographers is a significant problem so the challenge will be to buy linear accelerators that will not only meet a range of criteria, but also boost productivity by deliver ing treatment faster and making best use of scarce staff. </p> <p>In the south-west, Gloucester Royal, East Gloucestershire and Severn NHS trusts, the local health authority and primary care groups formed a consortium to buy special feeds for patients at home and in hospital. Budgets were pooled and a contract was awarded to a company for five years. Savings of \u00a3150,000 and improvements in services were achieved in the first year. </p> <p>Zoe Greenwell, head of procurement at East Gloucestershire NHS Trust, says the key to success was getting hospital doctors, GPs, dieticians, health authority and pharmacists working together. \"It's not just the salesmen and the procurement team you need to involve, you need everyone working with you when redesigning a service like this,\" she says. </p> <p>Technology should deliver improvements too.

Plastic is designed to be impervious to natural decay, which is why it's so useful for wrapping sweaty sandwiches in. Because it doesn't erode, this makes it an ecological nightmare. Twelve billion plastic bags are handed out to shoppers in Britain every year. Tesco's and Sainsbury's alone each hand out 1bn. Most plastic ends up in a landfill site. It will never biodegrade, but thanks to the biological conditions which exist in landfills, neither will organic waste such as onion clippings or hamburgers, which can remain intact for decades, 27m tonnes of it accumulating year by year. If someone in the future excavates these sites, they almost certainly will be living on a planet empty of blue whales, elephants and tigers. What they will have, however, are billions and billions of bags with the word Asda or Miss Selfridge stamped on the side.

      "body": "<p> A man who suckles on breastfeeding women, dumps on his neighbours' lawn, smashes up coke-vending machines and terrorises children and pensioners is likely, as they say on talk TV, to have a few issues to deal with. </p> <p>Charlie/Hank, the central character in Me, Myself and Irene, a new Jim Carrey blockbuster, due for release next month, has more troubles than most. Deserted by his wife and ridiculed by his community, this Rhode Island state-trooper is the proverbial nice guy until his pent-up rage turns him, according to the film's pre-publicity, \"from gentle to mental\". Diagnosed as having an \"involuntary schizoid personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies\", his dual personalities do battle for Irene's affections, wreaking havoc wherever they go. </p> <p>Funny, eh? Fans of Carrey's grimacing, scatological bad taste humour (Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura) will no doubt think so. The movie topped the US takings chart after its first weekend on release and, with its 15 certificate, promises to pull in the post-pubescent market here. But there is also a growing lobby of cinema-goers who fail to see the joke. </p> <p>In the US, Canada and Australia there have been widespread protests at the way Me, Myself and Irene misleadingly portrays schizophrenia as a Jekyll and Hyde, split personality disorder - and \"Hank\" as a violent threat to society - when schizophrenics are far more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of violence. Mental health campaigners have accused the film's distributors, 20th Century Fox, of feeding all the worst prejudices about severe mental illness, whilst targeting 15 to 24 year olds, a group particularly vulnerable to the onset of schizophrenia. </p> <p>In Canada, where there have been some vicious recent attacks on homeless schizophrenics - including one killing - the criticisms have had a bitter resonance. Here, the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, Mind and other organisations have signed up to the international campaign and are targeting 300 cinemas for leafleting and local protests when the film is released on September 22. </p> <p>The NSF is not calling for Me, Myself and Irene to be banned. But it does want it to have an 18 certificate, and has complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the film's promotional material. In other countries this has centred on \"schizo\", split-face images of Carrey, with promotional products that include jelly-bean \"pills\" claiming to cure schizophrenia. Even before the film's UK release, it looks like the protestors may have got some results. Twentieth Century Fox has said it is dropping the gentle-to-mental catchline, and replacing its split personality poster with one that presents a \"warmer, more romantic\" image, playing up love interest Renee Zellweger, and one of the film's more appealing characters, a cow. </p> <p>All this sturm und drang about a movie is a new departure for British mental health organisations. Unlike in the US, where minority groups routinely protest at films and TV programmes they find offensive, campaigners here fret about appearing to have a sense of humour by-pass, or being thought overly PC. Now though, the tide may be turning. </p> <p>The NSF and other charities have begun advising TV scriptwriters - for example, on EastEnders and Peak Practice - on how to present mental illness in a more realistic and empathetic light. EastEnders' portrayal of the gradual development of schizophrenia in the character Joe Wicks has been widely praised for avoiding sensationalism. </p> <p>The government's national service framework on mental health, its new mental health tsar, and the Royal College of Psychiatry's \"Changing Minds\" campaign have all contributed to giving anti-stigma work a higher profile. Generally, there is more awareness across the care professions of the way that stigma and discrimination deepen the distress caused by mental illness, fuel nimbyism and make early, successful treatment less likely. </p> <p>Nevertheless, 70% of people still see schizophrenics as a threat to themselves and their families: one of the most feared groups after paedophiles and drug-pushers. This, despite the fact that one in 100 people will develop the illness at some time, and that - contrary to popular mythology - the proportion of homicides carried out by mentally ill people has been falling since the late 1950s. Although it is a serious mental disorder that may involve delusions and hallucinations, schizophrenia has nothing to do with harbouring multiple personalities. And the risk of violent behaviour among people with the illness is only marginally greater than for the population as a whole. </p> <p>Psychiatrist Peter Byrne, who heads up the RCP's working party on media and stigma, argues that ignorance and crude stereotyping contributes enormously to the distress experienced by mentally ill people and their relatives. \"Take the powerful psycho-killer image that's used so often in movies. Research has shown that for someone with severe mental illness, this is often the single biggest contributor to the stigma they suffer.\" Even a semi-realistic medical drama like ER invariably shows mentally ill people as violent and dangerous, he says, most infamously in the dramatic episodes that involved a double stabbing by a man with schizophrenia. </p> <p>Byrne finds Me, Myself and Irene deliberately and cynically offensive. He wants it to go out with a health warning, stating that the behaviour displayed by its central character has nothing to do with schizophrenia, or indeed any actual mental disorder. Emma Harding, a young woman diagnosed as schizophrenic, agrees. </p> <p>\"The most sickening thing about the film is that it makes it seem OK to laugh at people with mental health problems, and that we're all totally out of control, as well as violent and dangerous. I have enough problems trying to convince my friends I'm not a \"psycho\" without needing this. </p> <p>\"But how far should this argument be taken? Me, Myself and Irene is not a health education film: it's an absurdist scattergun comedy. Images of madness - comic, tragic or both -have been a source of enduring fascination in films as far back as the escape-from-the-asylum chases of the silent movies, through to classics like Three Faces of Eve, Psycho and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. There is a whole genre of films based on multiple personality disorders alone. The attraction is obvious. Losing their mental health is most people's biggest dread. Films about madness, particularly ones that exaggerate the distinction between \"us\" and \"them\", tap into this fear but also allow us to take comfort in our normality. Hollywood knows this, which is why it has a whole new round of psycho-social dramas and remakes on the blocks. </p> <p>\"What all this is about is our inability to deal with difference,\" says Bruce Irvine, a clinical psychologist who works with adolescents. \"You can protest at harmful, distorted images of mental illness, but you can't stop people laughing at them. If anything, demonising this film may only make it more successful.\" </p> <p>For Carrey's critics, it's a risk worth taking. Paul Corry of the NSF says they are not against humour about mental illness, or showing schizophrenia for the frightening, psychotic condition it is. Productions like Blue/Orange at the National Theatre, or the feature film Some Voices, due out next week, prove it's possible to do both to great effect, he argues. And there are many other examples that successfully tread the fine line between dramatic effect and parody. What is unacceptable in the 21st century is to characterise someone who is mentally ill as a village idiot figure of fun. </p> <p>\"Looking for cheap laughs in this way would be ruled out for almost any other minority group,\" he says. </p> <p><strong>The old Jekyll and Hyde formula</strong></p> <p> Berating the Farrely Brothers' new movie for giving a misleading portrayal of mental illness is rather like accusing a Bruce Willis movie of failing to capture the realities of international terrorism.

      "bodyText": "A man who suckles on breastfeeding women, dumps on his neighbours' lawn, smashes up coke-vending machines and terrorises children and pensioners is likely, as they say on talk TV, to have a few issues to deal with. Charlie/Hank, the central character in Me, Myself and Irene, a new Jim Carrey blockbuster, due for release next month, has more troubles than most. Deserted by his wife and ridiculed by his community, this Rhode Island state-trooper is the proverbial nice guy until his pent-up rage turns him, according to the film's pre-publicity, \"from gentle to mental\". Diagnosed as having an \"involuntary schizoid personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies\", his dual personalities do battle for Irene's affections, wreaking havoc wherever they go. Funny, eh? Fans of Carrey's grimacing, scatological bad taste humour (Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura) will no doubt think so. The movie topped the US takings chart after its first weekend on release and, with its 15 certificate, promises to pull in the post-pubescent market here. But there is also a growing lobby of cinema-goers who fail to see the joke. In the US, Canada and Australia there have been widespread protests at the way Me, Myself and Irene misleadingly portrays schizophrenia as a Jekyll and Hyde, split personality disorder - and \"Hank\" as a violent threat to society - when schizophrenics are far more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of violence. Mental health campaigners have accused the film's distributors, 20th Century Fox, of feeding all the worst prejudices about severe mental illness, whilst targeting 15 to 24 year olds, a group particularly vulnerable to the onset of schizophrenia. In Canada, where there have been some vicious recent attacks on homeless schizophrenics - including one killing - the criticisms have had a bitter resonance. Here, the National Schizophrenia Fellowship, Mind and other organisations have signed up to the international campaign and are targeting 300 cinemas for leafleting and local protests when the film is released on September 22. The NSF is not calling for Me, Myself and Irene to be banned. But it does want it to have an 18 certificate, and has complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the film's promotional material. In other countries this has centred on \"schizo\", split-face images of Carrey, with promotional products that include jelly-bean \"pills\" claiming to cure schizophrenia. Even before the film's UK release, it looks like the protestors may have got some results. Twentieth Century Fox has said it is dropping the gentle-to-mental catchline, and replacing its split personality poster with one that presents a \"warmer, more romantic\" image, playing up love interest Renee Zellweger, and one of the film's more appealing characters, a cow. All this sturm und drang about a movie is a new departure for British mental health organisations. Unlike in the US, where minority groups routinely protest at films and TV programmes they find offensive, campaigners here fret about appearing to have a sense of humour by-pass, or being thought overly PC. Now though, the tide may be turning. The NSF and other charities have begun advising TV scriptwriters - for example, on EastEnders and Peak Practice - on how to present mental illness in a more realistic and empathetic light. EastEnders' portrayal of the gradual development of schizophrenia in the character Joe Wicks has been widely praised for avoiding sensationalism. The government's national service framework on mental health, its new mental health tsar, and the Royal College of Psychiatry's \"Changing Minds\" campaign have all contributed to giving anti-stigma work a higher profile. Generally, there is more awareness across the care professions of the way that stigma and discrimination deepen the distress caused by mental illness, fuel nimbyism and make early, successful treatment less likely. Nevertheless, 70% of people still see schizophrenics as a threat to themselves and their families: one of the most feared groups after paedophiles and drug-pushers. This, despite the fact that one in 100 people will develop the illness at some time, and that - contrary to popular mythology - the proportion of homicides carried out by mentally ill people has been falling since the late 1950s. Although it is a serious mental disorder that may involve delusions and hallucinations, schizophrenia has nothing to do with harbouring multiple personalities. And the risk of violent behaviour among people with the illness is only marginally greater than for the population as a whole. Psychiatrist Peter Byrne, who heads up the RCP's working party on media and stigma, argues that ignorance and crude stereotyping contributes enormously to the distress experienced by mentally ill people and their relatives. \"Take the powerful psycho-killer image that's used so often in movies.

And Smicer (who certainly has the skill to come good, but his tendency to pick up injuries and his frailty don't help) and Berger aren't natural wide men either. That's why signing Ziege - who can make overlapping runs for fun - could be so important.</p> <p>But that's probably Liverpool's only weakness. Expect them to come close - and maybe just nick it.

With Owen back, Fowler on his way, and Emile Heskey on hand to cause trouble in the attacking third (if not actually score), the Reds should not have to turn to Eirk Meijer too often in the hunt for goals. What's more, in Steven Gerrard, they have their first true box-to-box midfielder for some time. Yet there are still some nagging doubts about Gerald Houllier's side. As their puzzling dip at the back end of last season highlighted, they lack width. And if teams sit back against them - as they increasingly do - you can't see any of the current wide men taking on their marker and getting a cross in. Take a look at the candidates: Diomede seems is the most likely contender for the job - but he didn't impress at all in the World Cup. Barmby can also play on the left, but he is right footed and his best position is probably behind the front two or on the right. And Smicer (who certainly has the skill to come good, but his tendency to pick up injuries and his frailty don't help) and Berger aren't natural wide men either. That's why signing Ziege - who can make overlapping runs for fun - could be so important. But that's probably Liverpool's only weakness. Expect them to come close - and maybe just nick it. But Manchester United will be mighty tough to dethrone. In Pegguy Arphexad (Leicester), Markus Babbel (Bayern Munich), Bernard Diomede (Auxerre), Gary McAllister (Coventry), Nick Barmby (Everton), Robbie Shields (Tallaght). Out Phil Babb (Sporting), Stig-Inge Bjornebye (Blackburn), David Thompson (Coventry). Odds 11-2 Football Unlimited writers' prediction 2nd",

But last night Russian military personnel met Nato officials for half an hour to discuss the accident. A Nato source said the Russians had asked what assistance Nato could provide, but no formal request for help had been made. During the meeting the Russian representatives also spoke via teleconference with alliance naval experts in Northwood, the headquarters of Nato's naval command for the eastern Atlantic. The source said the meeting had been initiated by the Russians. Some 15 miles off Russia's northern coast, the surface rescue ship, Rudnitsky, was last night said to be at the site of the sinking in the Barents sea. From the ship the rescue capsule was lowered 350ft to try to evacuate the crew via the main escape hatch, situated on top of the vessel's stern. Russia's navy chief, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, reported to President Vladimir Putin that the chances of a successful operation were slim, because of the windy conditions and treacherous currents underwater. \"Our hopes are receding daily,\" Admiral Kuroyedov said last night. \"Experts believe the submarine will run out of oxygen before August 18. We must act fast... The only certainty is that people inside the submarine are alive and sending SOS signals.\" But information from the navy, the defence ministry, and the Russian government has been contradictory. Last night sources in the Russian navy said the accident had taken place on Saturday, a day earlier than previous official accounts indicated. The cause of the sinking of the Oscar-II class nuclear-powered submarine, while taking part in northern fleet war games, remained unclear. \"We haven't the slightest clue as to what could have caused the accident,\" said Igor Baranov, one of the submarine's designers. Navy officers and government officials said three main causes were being considered: that the submarine had hit an old mine from the second world war; that it had collided with another vessel, perhaps a foreign surveillance craft; or that there had been an accident on board while firing torpedoes, which caused the front of the vessel to take on water. Navy headquarters last night said the latest evidence from the site supported the notion that there had been a huge explosion on board, perhaps caused by torpedoes which failed to fire and instead blew up the nose of the vessel. Admiral Kuroyedov spoke of an internal explosion, a blast outside the hull or a crash. Reconnaissance photographs showed that the submarine's missile silo cover had been blown off, the conning tower dented, and material from the vessel scattered across the seabed. Some experts said the crew could survive until Friday. Mr Baranov, the designer, said the 116 men had only two days. Other navy sources compounded the confusion by saying said there was an emergency oxygen system \"capable of long-term functioning without power supplies\", but a northern fleet spokesman said oxygen on the Kursk was running out. Valentina Starotseltseva, the mother of one of the 116 crewmen, said: \"The information is not adequate. The whole family is just sitting in front of the TV for the second day. \"We don't understand why they're not saving our children.\" Relatives of most of the crew were taken to the northern navy base of Severomorsk where they were confined to a navy hospital ship. Dmitry Lachkov, a naval cadet whose father, Gennady, is the northern fleet captain commanding the submarine, said: \"We've only one wish, that this all ends well as soon as possible.\" Alexander Nikitin, a former St Petersburg navy officer and military analyst, said the capsule being used in last night's rescue attempt dated from the early 1980s. He noted that a similar operation to evacuate crew from a stricken sub in the far east in 1983 had resulted in most of the sailors' deaths. The Russians are said to have 11 such rescue vessels, all ageing, each capable of carrying 20 men. The capsules resemble mini-submarines equipped with special lighting and video equipment. \"Everything depends on the weather,\" Admiral Kuroyedov said. Winds at gale force five or six raged for most of yesterday in the Barents sea, shifting the crippled submarine on the seabed and scattering most of the surface ships involved in the rescue mission. Each of the capsule descents and rescue missions would take some seven hours and would need to be repeated six times to save the entire crew. Last night Admiral Kuroyedov was quoted as saying that if the escape capsules could not bring the crew to the surface, the navy would try to lift the crippled submarine from the seabed with inflatable pontoons. Last-minute preparations were being made last night to send a British submersible to the aid of the submarine crew. The British government has chartered an aircraft, which is due to arrive at Prestwick airport in Scotland this morning to pick up the submersible. \"The offer was made yesterday and we are waiting to see if the Russians respond,\" a Ministry of Defence spokesman said.",

      "bodyText": "The Civil Aviation Authority today confirmed that a single burst tyre caused the \"catastrophic accident\" which brought down the Air France Concorde, killing 113 people, and announced it was officially withdrawing Concorde's certificate of airworthiness. Safety experts say that a burst tyre should never be enough to bring down a passenger plane and that British Airways' seven-strong Concorde fleet will remain grounded indefinitely while an action plan to reduce the risk is worked out. The airliner was officially grounded today by the CAA as investigators in France revealed that the shredding of the number two tyre on the left main landing gear was the \"first significant event\" in the Paris disaster last month. BA ceased all its Concorde operations yesterday ahead of today's official announcement. Air France cancelled all its supersonic flights on the day of the crash. The CAA chairman Sir Malcolm Field, said that the burst tyre was the primary cause of the accident. He said that such an incident should never destroy a passenger plane. But Sir Malcolm said: \"We fully support British Airways' operation of Concorde after the crash.\" BA is expected to look at ways of modifying the airliner to get it back in service, although no timescale was given. Mike Bell, of the CAA safety regulation group, said he was confident that BA could carry out the necessary measures. Ken Smart of the Air Accident Investigation Board said that in-service experience showed that tyre damage during the taxiing, take-off or landing was \"not an unlikely event on Concorde and that it may actually lead to damage to the structure and to systems. However, this has never led to a fuel-fed fire\". He added: \"The July 25 accident has thus shown that the destruction of a tyre - a simple event which cannot be asserted not to recur - has had catastrophic consequences in a very short timescale without the crew being able to recover from this situation.\" Consequently, the AAIB and its French equivalent had made its recommendation about suspending Concorde's airworthiness certificate \"until appropriate measures have been taken to ensure a satisfactory level of safety as far as the tyre destruction-based risk is concerned\". Sir Malcolm said that CAA support for the BA decision to carry on flying continued until the first evidence from the joint investigation team was received. \"During the last three weeks BA has introduced a number of extra maintenance and operational procedures and, short of significant design changes, has done everything possible to ensure a safe operation. \"Their results have justified these actions. At this stage of the inquiry what is uniquely different in this case is that tyre debris alone is thought to have led to this catastrophic accident, which has persuaded us to accept the recommendation from the investigation team.\" Sir Malcolm said that the safety experts' recommendation had led to the suspension of certificates of airworthiness for each of the seven British-registered Concordes. He added that together with the French civil aviation authority, the Anglo-French manufacturers of the plane would be asked to recommend an action plan. Sir Malcolm went on: \"At this stage it is not possible to say how long these studies will take, and if there will be a requirement for any modifications, but we will conduct this work as thoroughly and quickly as possible.\" Investigators have said that a piece of metal found on the runway probably caused the tyre burst. It has not been determined where the metal came from but it does not appear to be part of Concorde. Mr Bell, head of the CAA's design and production standards division, said after the news conference that it could be \"some time\" before the necessary modifications could be made to enable Concorde to fly again. \"It will be months rather than weeks,\" he said.",

But George Clooney is reported to have turned down the chance to follow in their footsteps - because he reckons he's too good-looking. According to an interview with Hornby in the Daily Express, the novelist tentatively offered the ER graduate the chance to play the lonesome, single-man hero of his last book About a Boy in the upcoming movie adaptation, only to be knocked back. \"You would need someone more average looking,\" Clooney reportedly told him.",

For, over the summer break, the Chelsea manager's signature bald head has become the footballing hairstyle of choice. But although his team has a respectable on-pitch double in the form of Roberto Di Matteo and Frank Leboeuf, with \"Jimbo\" Hasselbaink easing into the swing of things with a bare millimetre of hair, Manchester United have surged ahead already. With Roy Keane, David Beckham, the newly arrived Fabien Barthez, and Jaap Stam, who replaced the woeful (and relatively hairy) Silvestre, United had scarcely a hair between them. </p> <p>Vialli has long been miles ahead of his rival managers in the style stakes, although to be fair, the competition is not tough. Like a thrifty market shopper, Arsene Wenger is too busy scouring France for \u00a32m bargains to have time to spend at the barbers. Alex Ferguson has a knighthood and more silverware than Buckingham Palace but looks like a ticket inspector. For the foot soldiers on the pitch, however, looks and image - and specifically, hairstyle - have become a major fashion statement. </p> <p>Because they work in uniform, as it were, footballers can't make style statements with their clothes, so their hair becomes disproportionately significant. When Beckham cut his blond locks, the fuss generated could scarcely have been greater if his fringe had been essential for taking free kicks. The public's interest can be a double-edged sword, though: Everton's Abel Xavier became a household name by dyeing his hair; Jason Lee, however, never recovered from the obsession of some football fans, Skinner and Baddiel included, with his dreadful pineapple hairstyle. </p> <p>What makes the bald look so striking is that until recently, footballers have been associated with long, floppy hair. The English pitches of the 70s were a sea of long hair and short shorts (the look now modelled by the Italians), while the 80s were awash with perming lotion. Through most of the 90s, the pin-ups of football - Ryan Giggs, Jamie Redknapp, both of whom are now short-haired - sported public school-ish floppy fringes. Until recently, the skinhead was the hairstyle of the football hooligan, the bouffant do the hairstyle of the football professional. </p> <p>It's amazing that the slaphead look didn't catch on before. Long hairstyles need to be kept in place, and not even Charlie's Angels quantities of hairspray could keep a coiff fixed through 90 minutes of careering around in the wind and rain. But sensible though the skinhead style undoubtedly is, what it suggests most strongly is not practicality, but aggression. There's no getting around the fact that not having any hair makes you look like a nutter - particularly when combined with running around kicking people and swearing. Long hair gives a slightly feminine air: think how much more menacing Emmanuel Petit, whose strawberry-blond ponytail is now bouncing around Barca, would be with a grade one skinhead. Roy Keane, hardly lacking what is politely called the competitive instinct in the first place, looks absolutely terrifying with no hair. (And if Sunday's performance is anything to go by, the United captain is more aggressive than ever.) </p> <p>Whether the skinhead look actually suits anyone is another matter entirely. True, it's an excellent foil for an unsightly bald patch, but such a huge expanse of skull tends to make eyes look shrewishly small by contrast, which is another reason that Keane looks scary. Blonds - unless they have Beckham's cheekbones - tend to look oddly undefined, like new potatoes. And while the severest of crops might be winning the full three points just now, any football pundit can tell you that a lot can change between now and the end of the season. </p> <p>Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea, three of the teams expected to do well in the Premiership season which kicks off on Saturday, all have a high slaphead quota, but there is still plenty of hair around. Benito Carbone, newly arrived at Bradford, shuns the clippers and sports a rather fetching white headband to keep his shoulder-length hair out of his eyes, and Ipswich golden boy David Johnson sports a fashionable Craig David mop of short twists. Let's hope they don't succumb to clipper peer-pressure: a whole league of skinheads would be a sinister sight. But I'm not too worried, to be honest. Can you see David Ginola shaving his head?</p>",

The \"Oscar\" that Clinton received from California governor Gray Davis was revealed to be a fake. A swift disclaimer from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences described it as no more than \"a fibreglass prop\" taken from the lot at Paramount studios. Davis, a Democrat, had presented Clinton with the phoney Academy Award on Monday night, saying: \"I want to give the Clinton family the highest award Hollywood can give for an extraordinary performance - an Oscar for being the best president.\" Clinton, who famously posed with Kevin Spacey's Oscar in the spoof video Clinton: The Final Days, appeared delighted with the award. \"I had Kevin Spacey's Oscar and he was ungracious enough to come and take it away from me,\" he told the assembled crowd. \"Now that I have one of my own, I'll be able to lord it over him.\" But yesterday brought a swift rebuttal from the real-life Academy. \"Our concern is that people are commenting that the president got an honorary Oscar,\" said Academy spokesman Jon Pavlik. \"We want people to understand that it wasn't really an Oscar.

Then there's the feeling that the future doesn't seem so bleak after all, now that the Windies Under-15 team have shown they're the best in the world by winning the recent World Cup in England. </p> <p>But while Headingley vindicates their policy of four fast bowlers, history has shown that it's the quartet from the home side that's more likely to prosper. Remember Graham's Gooch's brave, skilful unbeaten 154 nine years ago that won it for England? Headingley has not been that happy a hunting ground for West Indies. It's probably the Test venue they like least. But at least they are going into the match in greater heart than they began the Old Trafford game. </p> <p>The main reason for that is Brian Lara. The great man reckons he'll get most of his runs towards the end of tour - and England will hope he's wrong. He left it late on the 1995 tour and could well do the same here. He sets himself 500-run goals as often as a Soviet collectivist sets five-year targets, and if the odds are against him getting to that total, well, he will try. He does still look at least 10 pounds over his fighting weight (poor Andrew Flintoff has been grabbing all the headlines in this respect) but if his eye problems are serious and his hamstring and overall fitness remain suspect, then his mid-innings net at Manchester shows he's got his focus and determination back. </p> <p>At Manchester, Adams helped Lara stage the Windies' fightback, though he must take some of blame for getting them into a bad position through his extraordinary decision to bat after winning the toss. On a first-day pitch, under overcast skies, and with a debutant to face Ambrose and Walsh, Adams was being almost too clever in thinking about not wanting to bat last rather than making use of the helpful conditions. His belated declaration on the last day showed up the real game plan - to avoid defeat rather than go all out for victory. As they'd tell him down at Elland Road, Leeds is a difficult place to pack your midfield. Adams will have to be attacking from now on, and make sure his side secures the results. </p> <p>And his captaincy skills could again be tested by sessions like the first one of the second day, when Stewart and Trescothick were galloping away with the game, and the Windies gave the worst exhibition of fielding I've ever seen from a Test side. One of the most painful incidents to watch was when three lethargic fielders all failed to go for a catch any of them could have taken to dismiss Trescothick. They can go to pieces with alarming ease, and Adams has to react more quickly to that than he did at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Ridley Jacobs will be pleased about ending his run of low scores, but appalled by his terrible miss of Nasser Hussain in the second innings. This is no time for him to revert to his old reputation for having the iron gloves of a young Rodney Marsh - a reputation he shed so decisively in the 21 months he's been a West Indies regular. For the Scotland game, he gave the gloves to his work-experience understudy Wayne Phillip, and should be fresh for Headingley. </p> <p>The dependable Shiv Chanderpaul is still injured, and his wonderful innings at Edgbaston shows how much he is missed. His neat-looking replacement Ramnaresh Sarwan continues to suffer from indifferent form in the tour matches, and hasn't quite reproduced the kind of batting that brought him 84 not out on his debut against Pakistan earlier this year. Adrian Griffith helped the second innings cause in Manchester, in what may have been a career-saving knock. </p> <p>And the bowling? Franklyn Rose and Reon King in particular bowled some pretty brainless stuff to Alec Stewart in the third Test - lots of short balls to one of the best back-foot players in the game today. Some armchair experts in Guyana (where I am at the moment) think there's a case for King taking the new ball with Courtney Walsh, with the reasonable explanation that he'll have to do it in Australia if Ambrose goes as he said he will at the end of this tour. </p> <p>King's biggest advance came in New Zealand last winter, where he was forced to take the new ball and the responsibility, and responded by bowling better than even Courtney Walsh (Ambrose missed that tour).

I doubt whether Jimmy's that brave. </p> <p>Here in the Caribbean they're making a big deal out of the victory of the Under-15s. They haven't forgotten the youngsters' sense of occasion, when they put on their maroon West Indies blazers and cheered the senior players on at Old Trafford. They were there with Lara as he closed in on his century, and he had to have felt a responsibility to demonstrate to them - big brother to little brother, teacher to pupil - what skill and commitment are all about. The youngsters showed by their actions on and off the field that the pride is back, and that can clearly be felt in the region.

      "bodyText": "Police have arrested 63 people after an investigation into allegations of education grants fraud involving more than \u00a3300,000 of council taxpayers' money, and the number of arrests could double, it emerged yesterday. Among those arrested in the inquiry by South Wales police are three employees of Cardiff council and detectives believe the total of arrests could reach 120. They said it could take another six months to complete the investigation. Investigators are examining the award of more than \u00a3300,000 in further education grants to people who were allegedly not entitled to receive them. They are looking into whether officials at the Labour-run authority were pressured or intimidated into approving grants for college courses including A-levels. Three employees of Cardiff's education grants department have been sacked since the alleged fraud was exposed by a district auditor's inquiry six months ago. One is appealing against the dismissal. The head of Cardiff Central CID, detective chief inspector Graham Lloyd, said three of those arrested so far were council employees and the others were members of the public. No charges have been made, but police are expected to liaise with the crown prosecution service over issuing summonses to those allegedly involved. The Liberal Democrat leader on the council, Rodney Berman, said more heads should roll at the council if the scandal was as great as was being predicted. \"Questions must be asked as to what lax procedures the administration has allowed to be in place in the education department for this to go unnoticed,\" he said.",

Several people were hurt as police horses and riot squads moved in. The came at the end of a long hot day of marches in protest at \"corporate greed\". About 8,000 people had assembled for the concert. As it ended, a small number of protesters threw missiles - mainly plastic bottles, although the police said stones had also been thrown - and tried to scale the perimeter fence. The police started clearing the area, striking out with batons, firing rubber bullets and bringing in horses. A number of people, including Ted Hayes, a leading homeless activist, were felled. Several legal observers were injured as people fled in the confusion. The Los Angeles police department has adopted a policy of \"saturation policing\", which means that officers in riot gear run into position every time there appears to be a gathering on the street. Its spokesman, David Kalish, said the strategy was to \"saturate the area, maintain the peace and ensure public safety\". But many in the crowd felt that the police had over-reacted. Although some anarchists had started to cut holes in the perimeter fence with wirecutters, most of the crowd made no effort to breach the security net. Thirty-nine people have been arrested since the weekend, including 10 who were protesting against the Gore family's involvement in Occidental Oil, which has drilling rights in land claimed by the U'wa Indians in Colombia.",

The government, basking in the warm afterglow of Gordon Brown's marriage and his equally popular comprehensive spending review, is back up two points to 44%, while the Conservatives have dropped one point to 33%. The gap between the two parties narrowed in July to seven points as Mr Hague's law and order initiatives appeared to hit home. The Guardian/ICM is the third poll in a fortnight to indicate a summer Labour recovery, and so confirm the trend. It also shows the first signs of life stirring among those voters prepared to back Britain's entry to the euro. Some 31% of voters say they would be prepared to back Britain joining the euro if there were a referendum tomorrow. This is an increase of eight points in two months and the highest level of support enjoyed by the pro-euro camp since May 1999. The rise may reflect the impact of warnings from Japanese car manufacturers on the impact of Britain staying out of the euro, or it may be a perverse result of those leaked memos from Tony Blair in which he declared his personal backing for eventual membership of the euro. Whatever the explanation, the pro-euro camp does not appear to have changed many minds. The anti-euro share of the vote has remained solidly at the 57%-58% mark, and the increase in support for the euro has nearly all come from moves from the \"don't knows\" to the yes camp. Mr Blair has a long way to close the gap between yes and no camps before he calls the promised referendum after the election. The longer term perspective provided by the graphic, showing the average ICM poll positions for each year since 1992, gives a measure of how much progress Mr Hague has yet to make before he starts to threaten Labour's commanding Commons majority. The run of leaked memorandums revealing the anxieties of some of Labour's high command about the scale of their expected second term general election victory next year, and the arguments over asylum and law and order, have added a couple of points to the Conservatives' poll rating - so that they are hitting 34%-35% each month, rather than 31%-32%. But the longer term perspective shows the reality is that the Conservative share has languished in the low 30s, and has yet to recover the ground lost by the cataclysmic Black Wednesday in 1992 when the pound suffered its humiliating exit from the European exchange rate mechanism and interest rates hit 15%. Labour, with its average rating for 2000 at 44% - the share it actually polled in its historic 1997 victory - would appear to be on course for a second term with a very large Commons majority. The fall from a peak of 53% represents nothing more than the bursting of the bubble of euphoria that built up after Labour's first victory in 23 years. The Liberal Democrats have remained becalmed at around the 17%-18% share of the vote for three years now.

Otherwise sombre professionals were transformed into giggling juveniles by their mere proximity to a Simpsons Mania ticket. The table erupted into a discussion of how culturally important the animated series is, how Groening came up with the idea for it, its subversive nature, its brilliant writing, the famous people who have been lucky enough to be immortalised in yellow, its origins on The Tracey Ullman Show, and its unerring quality over 10 years on British television.

I raised my hand. </p> <p>\"That was them sitting there,\" she smirked. We were dumbstruck. As seven heads swivelled to look out the restaurant window, Hank Azaria (who plays Apu and Moe) and a band of less well-known faces smiled benevolently in. Azaria waved graciously. </p> <p>An hour later, after clips from the show specially selected for a Scottish audience (there were lots of mad janitor Groundsman Willie), Azaria, Nancy Cartwright (Bart), Yeardley Smith (Lisa), Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Pamela Hayden (standing in for Julie Kavner as Marge), Harry Shearer (Principal Skinner) and Tress MacNeille (Milhouse) took their seats in front of an adoring crowd and began reading Lisa's Date With Density. </p> <p>As soon as anyone opened their mouth, there was a cheer.

(It would have been understandable if it had, given that the show's flimsy programmes cost a hefty \u00a37.) </p> <p>As a kilted Cartwright adroitly jumped between Bart and Nelson, and a slight, balding man you wouldn't be surprised to learn was a serial killer opened his mouth and Homer's tones escaped, there was a weird dislocation between what was seen and what was heard. Hearing these people speak with the voices of Lisa, Marge and Apu seemed more unreal than the three-fingered cartoon characters who stood in clusters on either side of the stage.

And then I remembered it was just a cartoon. </p> <p>The tremendous vocal talents of each actor was amply displayed, with the cute-as-her-character Yeardley Smith and Azaria particular delights. This was a genuine, generous ensemble, with not a hint of ego from Castellaneta, who could be forgiven for thinking himself the star of the show. </p> <p>If anything did mar proceedings, it was the difficulty inherent in taking a TV show unique for its visuals and stripping them away. The narrator's scene-setting was essential but laborious, and who in the crowd knew what a \"smash cut to the Simpson foyer\" was? It was less radio than TV without the pictures. Still, the audience - which included a slew of stand-up comedians and actor Peter Mullan - revelled in being face to larynx with the voices of The Simpsons. </p> <p>And as if to prove it, when the opportunity for questions arose, most were of the \"Will you say 'Doh!'?\" and \"Can we hear from Mr Burns?\" variety. Naturally, the actors obliged and Castellaneta's cry of \"Doh!\" and Shearer's hissing \"Excellent!\" were lapped up.

The first play in the sequence, Silver Face, dates from 1922. Clearly Valle-Inclan intended to overturn the polite conventions of Spanish drawing-room comedy with a huge, non-naturalistic epic in which movement and design were as important as language. Never staged in Valle-Inclan's lifetime (he died in 1936), the trilogy was successfully revived in Madrid in 1991. I saw it and sat before it in a state of hypnotised bewilderment. I now see why. </p> <p>Valle-Inclan's trilogy is a feudal family saga about a Galician patriarch, Don Juan Manuel de Montenegro, and his six sons. In the first two plays we see the hero abducting a young woman, Sabelita, who is niece to a local abbot, denying a right of way across his land and coming into conflict with his raping, robbing sons. In the third play, which is much the richest, Don Juan Manuel installs a group of itinerant beggars in the family house, repents of his maltreatment of his pious wife, and dies at the hands of his eldest son. </p> <p>The hero is an amoral but ultimately penitent force of nature, a mixture of an ageing Don Juan and a Galician Lear. \"My life,\" he cries at one point, \"has been one long night of thunder and lightning.\" Valle-Inclan was clearly a radical spirit obsessed by the Spanish contrast between conscienceless wealth and homeless poverty; the scene where the beggars take over the hero's palace and enact a parody of the Last Supper leads straight to Bunuel's Viridiana. </p> <p>The trilogy is a Spanish landmark, but it seems curiously alien to a non-Hispanic audience. McGuinness's version implies parallels between Spain and Ireland: an oppressive church, a dispossessed underclass, a preoccupation with land. But the more he strives to forge a connection between Galicia and, say, Galway the more distant the plays become. There is simply nothing in Anglo-Irish drama that matches Valle-Inclan's delight in violent grotesquerie. </p> <p>Bieito encourages the Irish actors to adopt a style of ranting excess. Lines are bellowed; coats are flung to the ground; even sex is made to resemble a form of grievous bodily harm. One is left gawping at the unremitting energy of Mark Lambert as the tyrannous patriarch, Eamon Morrissey as his canine fool, Des Cave as a blustering abbot and Tonia Chauvet as a violated miller's wife. </p> <p>But the play is like some wild beast and, I suspect, works best in Spanish. Here the total meaning is elusive and even the locations remain vague, despite an impressive design by Alfons Flors that resembles a claustrophobic black grille.

A company called Aquascot, already involved in farming salmon, trout and turbot, is attempting to become the first commercial hatchery for cod. If successful, this would be the first species once caught in huge numbers by Britain's sea-going fleets to be reared artificially. </p> <p>Aquascot has already grown the first British batch of farmed cod to hit the fish slab. Earlier this year Marks and Spencer sold 4,000 fish, weighing about 10 tonnes, grown from eggs taken from wild fish caught off Mallaig, in the Scottish Highlands, and cultivated in publicly funded research labs. Three to four times that amount will probably soon be on their way to M&amp;S and Waitrose. </p> <p>But other fish from the same wild source are now being given a variety of feeds, lighting regimes and water temperatures in an effort to reproduce the conditions of their traditional February spawning season and develop an efficient breeding stock. So far fertilised eggs collected at the farm at Ardtaraig on Loch Striven, on Scotland's west coast, have failed to survive the near 10 days they need in an incubator before developing into the minute fish that will grow into Britain's best known partner for chips. </p> <p>Even when that process is successfully negotiated, the company must learn how to manage a further four months of the complicated growth process, in which the young cod, unlike young farmed salmon, need live feed before transferring to a dried pellet diet. Keith Agnew, an Aquascot director, said: \"They are very easily domesticated but we are only at the first hurdle. I think this will take 10 years to become big scale. We have to develop a whole new system. It is not the same as salmon farming.\" </p> <p>In the 14 years since salmon farming really took hold, by getting near the 10,000 tonne mark it has created a new market for a fish that for most of the 20th century hit only posh people's plates. Scottish farms will produce about 120,000 tonnes of salmon this year and form an industry supporting 6,500 jobs, more than two-thirds in the Highlands and Islands region. </p> <p>In contrast, Britain's conventional fishermen have recently produced little more than a third of the 170,000 tonnes of cod needed annually here. The rest is imported. \"We could be producing 50,000 tonnes of cod [in Scotland] annually once we have the technology cracked,\" said Mr Agnew. Supermarkets are watching the experiments closely. So are big brand names such as Birds Eye and McDonald's. </p> <p>Mr Agnew believes most cod farming, as with salmon, can be done in cages in the sea, at least after fish pass the juvenile phase. With sites near the coasts around the Scottish mainland and its islands in short supply, because they are taken by salmon or are unsuitable for environmental reasons, he is looking for alternatives. He has a vision of new businesses setting up in deeper water as the technology develops. \"Look at what the oil industry has done because the prize was there. You could have nurseries on shore, but there is no reason why farms should not be on the ocean bottom.\" Fishermen who once trawled the seas for cod could make a living as stockmen or maintenance workers. </p> <p>Eventually, Mr Agnew is planning a life cycle of less than two years for farmed cod, a quicker turnround than for other farmed fish in Scotland. Other species may follow. </p> <p>However, fish farming techniques have been criticised by scientists and environmentalists. Problems are worst in Asia where mangrove forests have been destroyed to farm shrimps for the European and US markets, but even in Scotland there has been excessive use of chemicals and the spread of disease to wild fish populations because of pollution and parasites such as ticks. In the worst cases pollution from fish farms, particularly in shallow coastal waters, have wiped out all other sea life. </p> <p>Global production of farmed fish and shellfish has doubled in the past 15 years as wild stocks have disappeared. Altogether 220 species are farmed. In Asia thousands of farms make millions of pounds exporting prawns to the west. In China, carp production accounts for half the world's fish farming, nearly all of it for Chinese consumption. </p> <p>The problem is what most farmed fish eat. Carp and some shellfish eat plants or bits of food already in the water. Farming them, and allowing them to feed naturally, makes a large contribution to the amount of extra fish available for human consumption. </p> <p>But other large species normally eat smaller prey in the same water and so have to be fed artificially. According to international research by five universities, instead of being the saviour of supplies, fish farming could be contributing to overfishing. Rosamond Taylor, of Stanford University, California, said commercial fleets had switched from fishing for species for human consumption to providing the raw material for food for fish farming. </p> <p>Between 1986 and 1997 four of the top five species captured by ocean fishing fleets, and eight of the top 20, were used in feed production for aquaculture and livestock industries. </p> <p>The study says \"the growing aquaculture industry cannot continue to rely on finite stocks of wild-caught fish, a number of which are already classified as fully exploited, overexploited or depleted\".

      "bodyText": "There were doubts last night over whether Concorde, the world's first supersonic jetliner, would ever fly again, after safety experts prepared to withdraw its certificate of airworthiness. Twenty-six years after Concorde's first commercial flight, British Airways unexpectedly grounded its seven-strong fleet until further notice after learning of official question marks over safety. BA dramatically halted the 10.30am Heathrow-to-New York service as it was taxiing towards the runway, ordering the pilot to stop, turn around and return to base. And last night the last BA Concorde left in service flew back from New York to London with only a crew on board. On landing at Heathrow, the Concorde was to join the rest of the fleet grounded in the company's main maintenance and engineering hanger. BA had previously suspended Concorde flights for just one day after the fatal crash last month of an Air France plane outside Paris. Air France's five remaining Concordes have been grounded since the disaster, in which 113 people died. The BA chief executive, Rod Eddington, explained the unprecedented step to ground the aircraft, whose future was looking increasingly bleak last night: \"We were notified this morning by the Air Accidents Investigation Bureau that, in the light of latest information available to it, it and its French counterpart, the BEA, it would tomorrow recommend that the certificate of airworthiness for the aircraft would be suspended. \"We discussed this with the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] and we understand that it would be minded to accept this advice.\" As speculation grew about Concorde's future, David Learmount of Flight International magazine said: \"This action is basically saying that this aircraft is not airworthy... If modifications are possible, and needed, then the airline will have to decide whether it would be commercially viable to do so.\" A former BA pilot, Captain Eric Moody, told Sky News it must have been a \"very serious fault\" to withdraw the certificate of airworthiness. \"I honestly hope and believe that they will get it back into the air,\" he said. The CAA said that in discussions with the international team investigating the crash it had become aware that the likely interim finding of the inquiry was that \"a single tyre burst\" had caused the catastrophe - Concorde's first fatal accident in 26 years of commercial operation. It said the authority believed that Concorde's operating certificate should now be suspended \"to enable further measures to be considered to ensure a satisfactory level of safety exists with regard to the risks associated with tyre bursts of Concorde\". Despite several scares in the wake of the French disaster, BA had maintained its confidence in the fundamental safety of Concorde's design. Mr Eddington said yesterday he did not regret the earlier decision to keep flying. \"We took the right decision at the time,\" he said. \"We worked closely with the investigators and regulators on a daily basis. We have been flying this aircraft in commercial service for 25 years. It's done 50,000 flights with us and it has a terrific record.\" In a statement, the airline said the CAA had been in \"complete agreement\" with its decision to keep on flying after the crash, since when it had carried out \"extensive extra checks on the airframe, engines, tyres and wheels, hydraulics and other systems\". After speculation that the Paris crash was caused by repairs to a thrust reverser on one of the doomed jet's port engines, investigators revealed that they had found pieces of Concorde tyre on the runway. This switched attention to the possibility that flying chunks of rubber had been \"ingested\" by one or more engines, sparking the fire and engine failure that downed the jet shortly after takeoff. French investigators refined that theory last week, saying they believed the crash was probably caused by a punctured fuel tank. A strip of metal on the runway had slashed one of the plane's tyres, they said, triggering the events that sent the plane spiralling into a hotel in the town of Gonesse. A full explanation of the inquiry's preliminary findings is expected this morning. The French transport ministry said officials would meet their British counterparts tomorrow to discuss the length of the recommended suspension, adding that the aircraft should remain grounded \"until appropriate measures guaranteeing a satisfactory level of safety concerning tyre risks\" were in place. It urged particular caution because of a relative lack of data. \"Concorde is the only supersonic airliner in the world and there are only a small number in service,\" it said. \"As a result, despite its long life, its track record is less developed than that of any other aircraft in civilian fleets.\"",

There were also a number of organs which cannot be identified found at the institute of child health, a university department on the hospital premises.</p> <p>It emerged during the inquiry into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary that Alder Hey, the largest children's hospital in Europe, had a collection of some 2,000 hearts. It was one of many hospitals that routinely kept them to assist in teaching and research.</p> <p>But organs, including brains, lungs and kidneys, were also removed, it was later discovered, without the knowledge or explicit consent of parents, doctors or the NHS trust. Some 800 organs were found in a laboratory store belonging to Liverpool University in Myrtle Street. An independent inquiry, ordered by the government, is under way.</p> <p>The latest finds are 146 cerebella; the cerebellum is the smaller, sub-brain lying below and behind the main cerebrum, which coordinates posture, balance and deliberate movement. They were given to a PhD researcher at the university by Dick van Velzen, the consultant pathologist who held a joint post at the hospital and university.</p> <p>Professor van Velzen oversaw around 500 postmortem examinations on children at Alder Hey while chairman of foetal and infant pathology at Liverpool University from 1988 to 1995. He has since returned to the Hague. The researcher was investigating the relationship between low birth weight and the size of the cerebellum. All the brain parts he used were taken between 1990 and 1995. The study has not yet been published.</p> <p>Jonathan Street, spokesman for Alder Hey, said yesterday that the cerebella had only been discovered at the end of the cataloguing process. They went missing from the count when all the Myrtle Street organs were transferred to Alder Hey for identification and cataloguing. \"These organs were put on to an ambulance and put with others that had already been catalogued and registered,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked if there might be any other organs in storage that had also been missed, he said: \"We honestly believe we now have found all the organs. We are aware that there have been occasions when the hospital made such statements and then found there were others.\"</p> <p>Cataloguing the organs had been a complex task worked on full time by three pathologists and a lot of technical staff since June, he said, but now it was believed to be complete.</p> <p>Mr Bradley of the parents' organisation said: \"Alder Hey has constantly told us that we have all the information and they are telling us the truth. Then we find out there is more.</p> <p>\"As well as this, it looks like the university has not been open with ourselves or Alder Hey.</p> <p>\"Why has it taken the university so long to admit they were involved? What other research has been carried out without parents' knowledge?\"</p>",

Families and their solicitors reacted yesterday with horror to the news that it has taken the hospital and Liverpool University - where the brains were being used in research - the best part of a year of scandal to discover that it is holding yet more human tissue in addition to the 2,000 hearts and 800 other organs already known about. \"We are devastated to learn of these latest revelations,\" said Ed Bradley, acting chairman of the parents' support group PITY II. \"Parents are constantly being battered by new disasters and we wonder how much more parents will have to take.\" Ian Cohen, a solicitor representing some of the families, said he could not understand why a family who had already held a second funeral after organs were returned should now have to face the appalling prospect of a third because some of the retained human tissue had been overlooked. \"What we have heard is that the university is going away and double-checking,\" he said. \"We're flabbergasted that 10 months later, they are double-checking.\" Two other revelations have come from an external board set up at the instigation of the health minister Lord Hunt to oversee the cataloguing of the organ collection. A further 62 families who had been assured that none of their children's organs was retained at autopsy have now been told the hospital got it wrong. There were also a number of organs which cannot be identified found at the institute of child health, a university department on the hospital premises. It emerged during the inquiry into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary that Alder Hey, the largest children's hospital in Europe, had a collection of some 2,000 hearts. It was one of many hospitals that routinely kept them to assist in teaching and research. But organs, including brains, lungs and kidneys, were also removed, it was later discovered, without the knowledge or explicit consent of parents, doctors or the NHS trust. Some 800 organs were found in a laboratory store belonging to Liverpool University in Myrtle Street. An independent inquiry, ordered by the government, is under way. The latest finds are 146 cerebella; the cerebellum is the smaller, sub-brain lying below and behind the main cerebrum, which coordinates posture, balance and deliberate movement. They were given to a PhD researcher at the university by Dick van Velzen, the consultant pathologist who held a joint post at the hospital and university. Professor van Velzen oversaw around 500 postmortem examinations on children at Alder Hey while chairman of foetal and infant pathology at Liverpool University from 1988 to 1995. He has since returned to the Hague. The researcher was investigating the relationship between low birth weight and the size of the cerebellum. All the brain parts he used were taken between 1990 and 1995. The study has not yet been published. Jonathan Street, spokesman for Alder Hey, said yesterday that the cerebella had only been discovered at the end of the cataloguing process. They went missing from the count when all the Myrtle Street organs were transferred to Alder Hey for identification and cataloguing. \"These organs were put on to an ambulance and put with others that had already been catalogued and registered,\" he said. Asked if there might be any other organs in storage that had also been missed, he said: \"We honestly believe we now have found all the organs. We are aware that there have been occasions when the hospital made such statements and then found there were others.\" Cataloguing the organs had been a complex task worked on full time by three pathologists and a lot of technical staff since June, he said, but now it was believed to be complete. Mr Bradley of the parents' organisation said: \"Alder Hey has constantly told us that we have all the information and they are telling us the truth. Then we find out there is more. \"As well as this, it looks like the university has not been open with ourselves or Alder Hey. \"Why has it taken the university so long to admit they were involved? What other research has been carried out without parents' knowledge?\"",

Jason Walsh, from Redruth, Cornwall, and a Japanese man died instantly when the minibus carrying them and 11 other backpackers collided with a four-wheel drive vehicle on the main coast road near the town of Ayr, 600 miles north of Brisbane, late on Monday. Ten people, including four Britons and two Irish people, were hurt in the crash. Six of the more seriously injured were taken to hospital, suffering mainly from broken bones. A Korean tourist whose leg had to be amputated was said to be in a stable condition. The crash occurred less than two months after 15 backpackers died in a blaze at a hostel in the small Queensland town of Childers. A young New Zealand woman who walked away from the minibus wreckage was said to have also survived the Childers inferno. The woman suffered only minor injuries in Monday's crash but was said by hostel staff in Ayr to be very traumatised by the latest incident. Queensland police were yesterday interviewing people involved in the crash and refused to speculate about the cause. Some of the witnesses were said to be too ill to be spoken to. The Australian drivers of the two vehicles were yesterday still in hospital. Mr Walsh, 28, was spending a year in Australia with his girlfriend Teresa Broglino, 24,. who was not on the fruit picking expedition as she had gone shopping. The couple, who had been together for six years, flew out to Australia at the end of May and stayed with Mr Walsh's cousins in Sydney before heading north to Queensland. Mr Walsh's father, Ian, said his son had kept in regular touch by postcard and email since leaving on what was to have been the trip of a lifetime. \"It is one of those things that happens to someone else,\" he said from the family's home at Lanner, near Redruth, yesterday. \"There had been other things recently like the fire in the hostel and it did cross my mind that something could happen.\"",

The veteran civil rights leader and former presidential candidate always had a knack for the killer soundbite - and he seems to have passed it on to his son.

But Jackson's point went beyond mere travel arrangements. He was voicing the sentiment of all those working to get Al Gore elected in November: they want Clinton out of the spotlight and their man in it. Every minute the president spends hogging the bright glow of national adulation is another 60 seconds for Gore to kick his heels in the grey chill of the waiting room. When the two men finally met for a \"torch-passing\" event in Michigan late yesterday, the Gore staff could barely conceal their relief. Now, they hope, the focus will move away from the eight years of Clinton - and on to four for Gore.</p> <p>But it won't be easy. Anyone watching the president's swansong address on Monday could see that. The camera panned across faces mesmerised by Clinton's sheer star power. Their eyes were wide open, rapt in attention; they bit their lower lips when he did, as if in solidarity. And when he gave them the slightest cue, they cheered and cheered.</p> <p>There are not many politicians who could get away with as weird an entrance as Clinton dared. A camera showed him alone and without entourage, walking through the corridors and stairwells of the convention centre, before emerging through a tunnel and on to the stage: he looked like Russell Crowe in Gladiator. He may, as he told the Democratic devout, now come \"with hair greyer and wrinkles deeper\", but he is at the peak of his powers: it is hard to think of a more charismatic performer in any field, music or the arts or sport, anywhere in the world.</p> <p>And yet, though only 54 years old this week, Bill Clinton will soon have to walk away from the job he so obviously loves. There is no logic to it: he wants to carry on doing it and the voters want to let him. Polls show consistently that if the constitution allowed it, Bill Clinton would walk a third term.</p> <p>This is what Al Gore is up against. It is not that he's without assets: he is a fine looking man with a sharp brain (tomorrow night he will break with political custom by delivering a speech he has written himself). And he has some star power of his own: he will be formally nominated by his old Harvard room-mate, the actor Tommy Lee Jones.</p> <p>Gore even has some advantages denied to the big guy. He didn't dodge the draft, but volunteered to serve in Vietnam: hence tomorrow's \"salute\" to veterans of that war, a treat that was unavailable to Bill. His family life is blameless: if Monica had dropped by Al's desk to deliver pizza, she'd have got nothing more than a plea to recycle the box.</p> <p>Yet somehow Gore adds up to less than the sum of these parts. His problem is an X-factor so nebulous and elusive, it seems cruel to punish him for lacking it: charisma. As Gail Collins wrote in yesterday's New York Times, while Clinton can make members of a large audience feel as though they're sitting in his living room after dinner, Gore \"can make people sitting in his living room after dinner feel as if they're in a large audience, taking notes\".</p> <p>The result is the shadow. He is the younger brother overshadowed by a naughtier, sexier sibling; now he has to break free. That would be hard enough if it just meant enduring constant and unflattering comparison. But Gore has a trickier act to pull off. He somehow has to stay associated with the good bits of the Clinton record - unbroken economic prosperity - yet keep his distance from the personal sleaze that marred the Clinton years.</p> <p>But here is the comforting news for Gore: he is not the only one in the shadow. He shares that problem with his opponent and indeed every politician on the American scene. They are all doing battle on ground shaped by the man they want to replace.</p> <p>So George W Bush looks only slightly better than Gore when held up to the bright TV light of Clinton. The president's Monday performance will have erased much of the lustre left over from W's squinty-eyed attempt a fortnight ago. Besides, the Clinton factor hovers above the Bush candidacy in a more direct way: it makes it a grudge match. One White House official says Bush's motivation in seeking the presidency can be captured in a single word: Daddy. W wants to avenge Clinton's defeat of Bush Sr in 1992, a victory the American right have never quite accepted. That campaign was fought as a family feud - with Barbara Bush laying into Hillary - and this one already has a similar quality. Except the Bushes' enemy is not the Gores, it's the Clintons.</p> <p>Still, the longest shadow cast by the man from Hope is on the substance of the 2000 contest. Clinton's great contribution to modern politics was what he called \"triangulation\" - recast by Tony Blair as modernisation and the third way. Clinton realised that Democrats would only win if they moved rightward on welfare, crime and the deficit. That centrist, New Democrat ground is where Gore wants to fight now.</p> <p>But Clinton's logic did not only apply to Democrats. George W realised the same was true of his own party: Republicans, too, had to move to the centre on issues where they had previously been deemed extreme. For them, that meant pensions, healthcare for the elderly, education and, most visibly, social diversity. Clinton had repeatedly beaten Republicans by casting them as right-wing and out of touch on those questions; Bush aims to defeat that charge with his centrist brand of \"compassionate conservatism\". The result was the Republicans' Cotton Club convention - lots of blacks on the stage, none in the audience - and Bush's leftward shift, promising new spending on the elderly's pensions and prescriptions. As one Democrat boss told the LA convention this week: \"The Republicans pretended they were tolerant, pretended they were moderates. . . Let's face it, they pretended they were Democrats.\"</p> <p>This is the real Clinton legacy. He has defined the ground where elections are won, and it's in his image. It says you have to be tough on welfare, defence and crime but tender on race, education and the environment. Both Democrats and Republicans failed when they were one and not the other. The result is a stampede from both sides towards the centre, with each party trying to be like the other and a blur where the old battle lines used to be - leaving personality as the decisive factor. That worked perfectly for Mr Personality himself, of course. But it hardly suits Gore. All he can do is hope that tomorrow America sees on his shoulders a light sprinkling of Clinton's magic stardust - as if fallen from the king on to his less golden heir.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

For them, that meant pensions, healthcare for the elderly, education and, most visibly, social diversity. Clinton had repeatedly beaten Republicans by casting them as right-wing and out of touch on those questions; Bush aims to defeat that charge with his centrist brand of \"compassionate conservatism\". The result was the Republicans' Cotton Club convention - lots of blacks on the stage, none in the audience - and Bush's leftward shift, promising new spending on the elderly's pensions and prescriptions. As one Democrat boss told the LA convention this week: \"The Republicans pretended they were tolerant, pretended they were moderates. . . Let's face it, they pretended they were Democrats.\" This is the real Clinton legacy. He has defined the ground where elections are won, and it's in his image. It says you have to be tough on welfare, defence and crime but tender on race, education and the environment. Both Democrats and Republicans failed when they were one and not the other. The result is a stampede from both sides towards the centre, with each party trying to be like the other and a blur where the old battle lines used to be - leaving personality as the decisive factor. That worked perfectly for Mr Personality himself, of course. But it hardly suits Gore. All he can do is hope that tomorrow America sees on his shoulders a light sprinkling of Clinton's magic stardust - as if fallen from the king on to his less golden heir. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

She added that since the Air France accident BA had \"not noticed any difference\" in trade compared with this time last year. Yesterday BA shares were down just 1.25p at 381.5p.

The number of applicants being refused a social fund budgeting loan has grown from 4,856 in 1997/98 to 362,000 in 1999/2000. How did it happen? The main reason is a new rule, introduced by Labour, under which a poor person who has already received one loan is no longer eligible for a second loan until a major part of the first has been paid off.</p> <p>The new rule was defended by a government insider on the following grounds: \"We wanted to stop the money going to people who were topping up debts already owed. We have got to remember that this is taxpayers' money we are talking about. We wanted to make the system fairer, branch it out and recover the money paid out and not see it disappear down a great hole.\"</p> <p>But what this defence fails to address is the failure of the fund to meet its purported objective: to concentrate help on those most in need. From its very beginning, this has been the biggest defect of the fund. A three-year study, commissioned by the social security department from York University and published in 1992, came to the same conclusion. Even the Conservative social security minister of the day conceded the finding was \"dispassionate\".</p> <p>In reality, the social fund was introduced by the Conservatives in 1988 to cut public expenditure. In place of the old single payments grants system - for emergencies such as holes in the roof, worn-out children's shoes or broken down cookers and fridges, which poor people with no savings cannot meet - they brought in a new system in which the main emphasis was on loans, not grants.</p> <p>Three years into its operation, the national audit office noted that the fund was achieving its main aim - saving money - but that it was putting growing numbers of people into debt. Now, nine years on, the story remains the same.</p> <p>The new report shows that there were 1,946,000 loans this year (this includes crisis loans as well as budgeting loans), but the gross cost of \u00a3547m was reduced by \u00a3426m in repayments on earlier loans, making the net cost \u00a3121m.</p> <p>Labour has increased benefits for the poor, but not by sufficient amounts to bring them up to a decent standard of living. A succession of reports in the last decade (the most recent by the family budget unit of London University) has documented the degree to which people on benefits fall short of an \"acceptable\" living standard.</p> <p>The social fund's emphasis on loans has prompted bitter criticism from a wide spectrum of charities, concerned by the degree to which they are having to step in where the state once provided. Applications to the Family Welfare Association continue to rise. Worse still, some applicants rejected by the social fund turn to loan sharks as a last resort and end up paying exorbitant interest rates. MPs have criticised the way in which the fund's local budgets have led to an arbitrary system of support. People with the same needs are being treated entirely different according to the level of the local budget.</p> <p>Budgeting loans range from \u00a330 to \u00a31,000. This year's average was \u00a3389. Applicants must be in receipt of a benefit to apply. Large numbers are rejected for not being on benefit long enough. There is no legal repayment period, but the standard period is 78 weeks. They cover a range of emergencies, from the need for a new suit before going for a job interview, to the purchase of second-hand furniture enabling a homeless family to take up the offer of an unfurnished flat.</p> <p>In opposition, Labour was resolutely opposed to the fund. Its national commission on social justice, which reported in 1994, described the social fund as \"perhaps the most soul-destroying aspect of income support\". Robin Cook, the shadow social security secretary when the Tories introduced the fund, said: \"I would like to see the social fund go... if a family needs a new cooker... it needs a single payment...\"</p> <p>Now it is the poverty lobby which has to speak up. The Citizen's Advice Bureau has recently produced a report condemning Labour's changes. It documented the way its clients had suffered increased \"stress and hardship\" and the many ways the present system could be improved. The simplest change would be to replace the loans with the old single grant system. This would cost less than 0.4% of the current social security budget. It will be surprising if Labour escapes some serious trouble over all this at next month's party conference.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:malcolm.dean@theguardian.com\"> malcolm.dean@theguardian.com</a></p>",

In reality, the social fund was introduced by the Conservatives in 1988 to cut public expenditure. In place of the old single payments grants system - for emergencies such as holes in the roof, worn-out children's shoes or broken down cookers and fridges, which poor people with no savings cannot meet - they brought in a new system in which the main emphasis was on loans, not grants. Three years into its operation, the national audit office noted that the fund was achieving its main aim - saving money - but that it was putting growing numbers of people into debt. Now, nine years on, the story remains the same. The new report shows that there were 1,946,000 loans this year (this includes crisis loans as well as budgeting loans), but the gross cost of \u00a3547m was reduced by \u00a3426m in repayments on earlier loans, making the net cost \u00a3121m. Labour has increased benefits for the poor, but not by sufficient amounts to bring them up to a decent standard of living. A succession of reports in the last decade (the most recent by the family budget unit of London University) has documented the degree to which people on benefits fall short of an \"acceptable\" living standard. The social fund's emphasis on loans has prompted bitter criticism from a wide spectrum of charities, concerned by the degree to which they are having to step in where the state once provided. Applications to the Family Welfare Association continue to rise. Worse still, some applicants rejected by the social fund turn to loan sharks as a last resort and end up paying exorbitant interest rates. MPs have criticised the way in which the fund's local budgets have led to an arbitrary system of support. People with the same needs are being treated entirely different according to the level of the local budget. Budgeting loans range from \u00a330 to \u00a31,000. This year's average was \u00a3389. Applicants must be in receipt of a benefit to apply. Large numbers are rejected for not being on benefit long enough. There is no legal repayment period, but the standard period is 78 weeks. They cover a range of emergencies, from the need for a new suit before going for a job interview, to the purchase of second-hand furniture enabling a homeless family to take up the offer of an unfurnished flat. In opposition, Labour was resolutely opposed to the fund. Its national commission on social justice, which reported in 1994, described the social fund as \"perhaps the most soul-destroying aspect of income support\". Robin Cook, the shadow social security secretary when the Tories introduced the fund, said: \"I would like to see the social fund go... if a family needs a new cooker... it needs a single payment...\" Now it is the poverty lobby which has to speak up. The Citizen's Advice Bureau has recently produced a report condemning Labour's changes. It documented the way its clients had suffered increased \"stress and hardship\" and the many ways the present system could be improved. The simplest change would be to replace the loans with the old single grant system. This would cost less than 0.4% of the current social security budget. It will be surprising if Labour escapes some serious trouble over all this at next month's party conference. malcolm.dean@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "A team of four Britons has made the first ascent of the world's highest sea cliff, it was announced yesterday. But their climb of Thumbnail, a sheer granite face rising 4,490ft above a fjord in south Greenland, was overshadowed by the death of Matthew Bransby, 54, the father of one of the four and a member of the support team. Mr Bransby, an engineering consultant from Cirencester who had 40 years' experience of climbing, had ascended a nearby mountain to watch his son, Ben, reach the summit. Less than an hour after congratulating him by radio, Mr Bransby fell more than 1,000ft while abseiling. The climbers did not find out until they reached the base of the cliff the following morning. The expedition reached the summit on August 5, and returned last week. Its leader, Ian Parnell, said yesterday: \"The accident was a real shock, especially as it so closely followed the success of the climb.\" \"One small consolation is that Matthew was able to share the joy of the summit before he died. He was very proud of what Ben was doing.\" Mr Parnell added that it seemed Mr Bransby had been very unlucky: the only spike to abseil from had been quite small and blunt, and the rope had \"just flicked off the spike\". Fishermen and Danish police helped recover his body from the fjord. Mr Parnell, 31, Ben Bransby, 20, Matt Dickinson, 28, and Gareth Parry, 27, took five days to haul themselves, and two 75kg bags of equipment and supplies, up the granite face. At night they slept in 7ft by 3ft aluminium pole tents suspended from the rock face. \"Our special hanging ledges were a huge help,\" said Mr Parnell. \"They enabled us to set up camp in the middle of the steepest climbing, and weather several big storms. \"The climbing itself was often very difficult, sometimes overhanging by 30 degrees.\" Three of the team, including Mr Bransby, were considering climbing a granite spire in Pakistan next year.",

      "body": "<p>In the course of a radio interview yesterday about the problems of poverty, the social security minister, Angela Eagle, expressed the view that it should be possible to help poor people to help themselves, and thus avoid them becoming reliant upon benefits for the entirety of their lives. This is an objective of enormous political, social and economic significance for any government, but put it in the mouth of a politician and unfortunately it can easily sound like just another high-minded platitude. Most residents of Britain's inner cities would probably be hard put to identify evidence that much is being done by anyone in our multilayered bureaucracy to help achieve the reality.</p> <p>Yet help is actually at hand for Ms Eagle and, for that matter - for it is crucial for the success of his government - for Tony Blair. It is closer than either of them may be aware. All they need to do is to pick up the phone and make a call to their most recently elected parliamentary colleague, the new MP for Tottenham, David Lammy. Ms Eagle ought to ask him in to help and the prime minister ought to give him a job.</p> <p>In the last days before the House of Commons rose for the summer recess Mr Lammy, the \"baby\" of the House who had his 28th birthday the day before, made one of the more important and significant speeches heard in that place, possibly in the course of the whole year. This is not all that difficult in these dull-witted days when most speeches are written to the dictation of the whips' office and read out to a chamber as unaccustomed to original thinking as it is to oratory. Mr Lammy received scarcely any notice for the speech - beyond an honorary mention on this newspaper's parliamentary page as someone who had enjoyed a \"good day\" - but it was no less remarkable for that.</p> <p>It contained a prescription to resolve the difficulties identified by Ms Eagle about how to tackle poverty, and it also carried an immensely important message for this government and for the Labour party. More interesting still, Mr Lammy himself in some ways personifies an answer. There are two points: one, a pragmatic one about finding a practical way to deal with poverty, or how politicians respond to the problem; the other, its mirror image, how the poor respond to politics.</p> <p>Since the \"new\" Labour project has been put to the test in the course of these past three years, one of the main difficulties the government has encountered stems from the fact that the entire exercise is about imposing a political view from the top. It apparently works like this: Philip Gould and his cohorts go and ask a number of volunteers in focus groups what they want and what they care about and what they think the government ought to be doing. These results are then relayed to the government, which sets about attempting to meet these objectives. It may sound ludicrously simplistic, but the leaks of the early summer confirm, amazingly enough, that this is the level at which the brightest brains of Blairism are occupied.</p> <p>The \"unfinished revolution\", as we should more properly call it according to the unflagging Philip Gould, is thus a political philosophy of the utmost cynicism and, further, it is caught around with possibilities of grave error. Let us discount such obvious questions as to the identity and motivation of the people who make up the focus groups. Even then, not the least of the problems is that when you give people what they say they want, they are still almost certain to be dissatisfied. They may, for example, demand something worthwhile like more spending on the health service, yet it is impossible for this to be delivered swiftly enough to achieve a result that will please the punters. It should be a source of little wonder, therefore, that there is a degree of disillusion about the principles involved in the business of government by focus group.</p> <p>This could scarcely be more different from that which David Lammy described in his maiden speech to the House of Commons. He happens to represent the most multicultural constituency in Britain. It has the third highest rate of unemployment in England and much poverty. But while, as he said, the margins of society have provided some of the worst statistics of social exclusion, they can also provide a radical perspective about what needs to be done.</p> <p>He talked powerfully and with passion about this, about how politics can operate in the opposite direction, about the kind of politics that comes from the people themselves, that sets about improving people's lives and expectations. When we met, a few days beforehand, he described his constituency: \"Just because we are a poor community doesn't mean that we don't have expectations for ourselves.\" It's all about democracy, really.</p> <p>The most important phrase that Mr Lammy conjured up to make this point was that there is a specific need for society as a whole and government in particular to invest in people. He made his remarks in the context of public spending, but he wasn't really talking about investing in the infrastructure. He was born in Tottenham and - although he has been away - he loves it there still. He knows that over the years government spending has neglected to take into account the problems of the inner city, perhaps in the hope, as he put it, that poverty might just disappear by itself.</p> <p>But much more is needed than spending. It requires an attitude on the part of the state that everyone has something to offer. That is what happened to him. He was lucky and people invested in him. He is one of five children of a single mother and he is black. He went to a primary school called Downhills (how can any local authority ever have decided to call a school by such a name?) and he had a wonderful teacher. He could sing and he went to choir school at the expense of the London borough of Haringey. He went to university, where he read law. And he was off and away. He went to Harvard. No one said to him: \"Who do you think you are? This isn't for you. Black men from Tottenham don't go to Harvard law school.\"</p> <p>And somewhere along the line, atypically, he joined the Labour party. He found politics. He found it largely on his own. The Labour party wasn't out looking for people like him and, until relatively recently, it was not part of the culture of families like his to join any political party. He looked for them, though, because he recognised how lucky he had been and how many other people there were in the multicultural society that bred him who had - or could have - the same expectations and could benefit as he had.</p> <p>This is not a morality tale about black people. It is about helping poor people to help themselves. In his speech David Lammy called it \"investing in people's souls\".

      "body": "<p>An inquiry by the Israeli parliament is unearthing evidence that some of the country's leading financial and government institutions have kept hold of the assets of European Jews who died in the Holocaust.</p> <p>Under pressure from the inquiry and court action, there is emerging a disturbing picture of the pillars of the Israeli financial establishment blocking for more than half a century the efforts of victims' families to trace their inheritances.</p> <p>Although financial institutions are beginning to own up to the existence of the lost assets, they admit holding only small amounts. In the leading financial institution, Bank Leumi, most of the dormant accounts contain less than 10 shekels (\u00a31.60), giving rise to the suspicion that there has been a cover-up.</p> <p>Israel's failure to hunt down the rightful owners of these assets stands in stark contrast to its support for the campaign against banks in Switzerland, which paid out $1.25bn in compensation for accounts belonging to Holocaust victims whose existence had been kept hidden since the end of the second world war.</p> <p>More than two years after the Swiss pay-out, Israel is only beginning to divulge its own secrets.</p> <p>The parliamentary investigative committee set up to find the assets of Holocaust victims has recommended an independent audit of at least 12,000 dormant accounts and 3,000 safety deposit boxes at Bank Leumi.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Post published extracts from a closed-door parliamentary committee meeting which revealed that the safes had been emptied over the years and that no record of their contents had been kept.</p> <p>Meanwhile the justice ministry, which oversees 15,000 files of bank accounts and land whose owners have not been traced, has been prodded to launch a similar search.</p> <p>The parliamentary committee's chairman, Colette Avital, also plans to trace the owners of thousands of plots of land in bought in Palestine when the territory was under the British mandate.</p> <p>Campaigners argue that the Jewish state has a greater moral duty to see the assets returned to their rightful owners than the Swiss.</p> <p>During the 1920s and 1930s, Zionist leaders actively sought investment in Palestine from European Jews, who believed they were contributing to the Zionist dream, or who were preparing for their eventual emigration. With the war approaching, some were also looking for a haven for their savings.</p> <p>\"I find this position absolutely unbearable,\" said Arieh Edelist, a lawyer who survived a work camp in wartime Poland and has sought to trace those assets for the Council of Organisations of Holocaust Survivors.</p> <p>\"When someone asks me what you want from Switzerland when the Jewish government itself does not restitute properties, what can I tell them? We can't attack other governments and ignore our own.\"</p> <p>The sum of assets held by Jews who were killed in the war is unknown, but the estimates run to $40m in deposited money and tens of millions more in land, including prime properties in the Tel Aviv and Haifa areas.</p> <p>Shmuel Tsur, the administrator general at the justice ministry, estimates that 20% of its holdings, worth about \u00a360m, belong to European Jews killed in the war. But he admits that many plots of lands were sold to cover taxes or were expropriated by the Israeli state for development or military use.</p> <p>Apart from property and bank deposits, the ill-fated investors also bought shares and opened safe deposit boxes in what is now Israel. Yossi Katz, a historian at the Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, whose book on the vanished assets, Forgotten Property, was published last April, believes such shares now amount to about 10% of the value of Bank Leumi, which posted profits of more than $150m last year.</p> <p>The Israeli authorities did honour the claims of investors who survived the Holocaust and those few heirs lucky enough to hang on to documents despite the war.</p> <p>But many others were defeated by the impossibly high standards of proof demanded by an unresponsive bureaucracy: evidence that relatives died in concentration camps or that they were the sole survivors. Some did not know the details of family investments in Palestine.</p> <p>Until recently, when Bank Leumi, the justice ministry, and the Jewish National Fund made their lists of dormant properties public, the Israeli authorities made no effort to trace them.</p> <p>\"We have a relation to a property - not its owner,\" Mr Tsur said. \"We don't know what happened to these people, only that they do not exist. I can go to Yad Vashem [the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem], and find a name there on my list, but what will it tell me about the properties, and about the heirs?\"</p> <p>Knowledge of the investments was obscured by the tumultuous early history of the Israeli state, which came into being in 1948. In addition, \u00a32.9m in bank deposits, held by Jews living in Nazi-occupied Europe was seized by the British authorities during the war as enemy property, and transferred to London. Some \u00a31.4m was restored to Israel after the war.</p> <p>Mr Katz and others say Bank Leumi did not transfer all such deposits to Britain. The whereabouts of the remaining funds is unknown and the subject of dispute.</p> <p><b>'This is not about money. It is about justice'</b></p> <p>In 1938, when Eleazer Shafrir, above, was growing up in Krakow, his father visited Palestine and returned clutching the deed to a modest plot of land by the sea, writes Suzanne Goldenberg.</p> <p>\"He showed it to me and said 'this is where we will build our house',\" Mr Shafrir, now 76, says. \"Everybody knew something was happening in Europe and he wanted to make aliya [emigrate] but he was convinced by the people in Jerusalem that it was much more important that he be there in Poland.\"</p> <p>Instead, Mr Shafrir's father, Marcus Spiegel, (shown in the portrait above) a community leader, was among the first Jews rounded up when the Nazis occupied Poland.

      "bodyText": "An inquiry by the Israeli parliament is unearthing evidence that some of the country's leading financial and government institutions have kept hold of the assets of European Jews who died in the Holocaust. Under pressure from the inquiry and court action, there is emerging a disturbing picture of the pillars of the Israeli financial establishment blocking for more than half a century the efforts of victims' families to trace their inheritances. Although financial institutions are beginning to own up to the existence of the lost assets, they admit holding only small amounts. In the leading financial institution, Bank Leumi, most of the dormant accounts contain less than 10 shekels (\u00a31.60), giving rise to the suspicion that there has been a cover-up. Israel's failure to hunt down the rightful owners of these assets stands in stark contrast to its support for the campaign against banks in Switzerland, which paid out $1.25bn in compensation for accounts belonging to Holocaust victims whose existence had been kept hidden since the end of the second world war. More than two years after the Swiss pay-out, Israel is only beginning to divulge its own secrets. The parliamentary investigative committee set up to find the assets of Holocaust victims has recommended an independent audit of at least 12,000 dormant accounts and 3,000 safety deposit boxes at Bank Leumi. The Jerusalem Post published extracts from a closed-door parliamentary committee meeting which revealed that the safes had been emptied over the years and that no record of their contents had been kept. Meanwhile the justice ministry, which oversees 15,000 files of bank accounts and land whose owners have not been traced, has been prodded to launch a similar search. The parliamentary committee's chairman, Colette Avital, also plans to trace the owners of thousands of plots of land in bought in Palestine when the territory was under the British mandate. Campaigners argue that the Jewish state has a greater moral duty to see the assets returned to their rightful owners than the Swiss. During the 1920s and 1930s, Zionist leaders actively sought investment in Palestine from European Jews, who believed they were contributing to the Zionist dream, or who were preparing for their eventual emigration. With the war approaching, some were also looking for a haven for their savings. \"I find this position absolutely unbearable,\" said Arieh Edelist, a lawyer who survived a work camp in wartime Poland and has sought to trace those assets for the Council of Organisations of Holocaust Survivors. \"When someone asks me what you want from Switzerland when the Jewish government itself does not restitute properties, what can I tell them? We can't attack other governments and ignore our own.\" The sum of assets held by Jews who were killed in the war is unknown, but the estimates run to $40m in deposited money and tens of millions more in land, including prime properties in the Tel Aviv and Haifa areas. Shmuel Tsur, the administrator general at the justice ministry, estimates that 20% of its holdings, worth about \u00a360m, belong to European Jews killed in the war. But he admits that many plots of lands were sold to cover taxes or were expropriated by the Israeli state for development or military use. Apart from property and bank deposits, the ill-fated investors also bought shares and opened safe deposit boxes in what is now Israel. Yossi Katz, a historian at the Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, whose book on the vanished assets, Forgotten Property, was published last April, believes such shares now amount to about 10% of the value of Bank Leumi, which posted profits of more than $150m last year. The Israeli authorities did honour the claims of investors who survived the Holocaust and those few heirs lucky enough to hang on to documents despite the war. But many others were defeated by the impossibly high standards of proof demanded by an unresponsive bureaucracy: evidence that relatives died in concentration camps or that they were the sole survivors. Some did not know the details of family investments in Palestine. Until recently, when Bank Leumi, the justice ministry, and the Jewish National Fund made their lists of dormant properties public, the Israeli authorities made no effort to trace them. \"We have a relation to a property - not its owner,\" Mr Tsur said. \"We don't know what happened to these people, only that they do not exist. I can go to Yad Vashem [the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem], and find a name there on my list, but what will it tell me about the properties, and about the heirs?\" Knowledge of the investments was obscured by the tumultuous early history of the Israeli state, which came into being in 1948. In addition, \u00a32.9m in bank deposits, held by Jews living in Nazi-occupied Europe was seized by the British authorities during the war as enemy property, and transferred to London. Some \u00a31.4m was restored to Israel after the war. Mr Katz and others say Bank Leumi did not transfer all such deposits to Britain. The whereabouts of the remaining funds is unknown and the subject of dispute. 'This is not about money. It is about justice' In 1938, when Eleazer Shafrir, above, was growing up in Krakow, his father visited Palestine and returned clutching the deed to a modest plot of land by the sea, writes Suzanne Goldenberg. \"He showed it to me and said 'this is where we will build our house',\" Mr Shafrir, now 76, says. \"Everybody knew something was happening in Europe and he wanted to make aliya [emigrate] but he was convinced by the people in Jerusalem that it was much more important that he be there in Poland.\" Instead, Mr Shafrir's father, Marcus Spiegel, (shown in the portrait above) a community leader, was among the first Jews rounded up when the Nazis occupied Poland. He died in Auschwitz in 1940. Three years later Eleazar escaped from a Nazi work camp to Palestine, where he became a biochemist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. Although at present-day values, a small plot of land north of Tel Aviv would be worth about $250,000, Mr Shafrir says he is not motivated by money. \"I want justice to be done. I think this is fundamental justice. I am waiting patiently. I do not want to enrich myself.\" However, Mr Shafrir ran into an impenetrable bureaucracy when he tried to trace the land. Efforts to prove his entitlement through the mandate-era land registry were prohibi tively expensive. Last November he became part of a class action suit brought against a company for disclosure of its holdings. \"What is painful is that we demanded from the Swiss and other nations the return of Jewish property and the return of Jewish art belonging to people who died in the Holocaust,\" he says. \"But in our country, we can not organise the return of property to survivors of people lost in the Holocaust.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence, reeling under attacks on its performance, faces renewed criticism today by a committee of MPs which denounces delays and cost overruns amounting to nearly \u00a33bn in procuring weapons systems - including weapons that could have been used instead of cluster bombs in the Kosovo war. The MoD's \"current performance in procuring equipment to cost and time is unacceptable, and there is no evidence that the department are controlling projects any better now than in the past\", said the cross-party Commons public accounts committee. David Davis, its Conservative chairman, piled on the agony for the MoD, describing its track record in procuring equipment as abysmal. He made it clear the committee was fast losing patience with the ministry's promises for potential savings in its \"smart procurement\" programme. One project highlighted by the MPs is the Brimstone air-launched anti-armour weapon, already 10 years late. Its unavailability \"has had an adverse effect on the United Kingdom's operations against armoured threats during the 1990s, including Kosovo\", they said. Sir Robert Walmsley, chief of defence procurement, admitted in evidence to the committee that it would have been better to have had Brimstone instead of relying on cluster bombs during the Kosovo war. In a letter subsequently sent to the committee, the MoD admitted that \"the limitations of the BL755 and RBL755 [cluster bombs] were well understood\". According to the UK working group on landmines, Nato cluster bombs are estimated to have killed between 90 and 150 civilians in the Kosovo conflict, and unexploded cluster bombs have since caused more than 200 casualties. An MoD report leaked this week - not disclosed to MPs - estimated that 60% of the 531 cluster bombs dropped by the RAF missed their intended target or remain unaccounted for. The MPs, in their report released today, point to a six-year delay in the Bowman battlefield radio system. This month the MoD announced it was launching a new tender for the system after dismissing the consortium that had been developing it for three years at a cost of \u00a3212m. The MoD continued to make basic errors in estimating progamme costs, the committee said, pointing to a missing \u00a32m VAT bill on a new air-to-air missile project. It was unacceptable that defence inflation - which accounted for \u00a3400m of the cost increases in 1998 - was running at 5%-6% when factory gate prices were falling. They scrutinised 25 big defence projects with a total cost of \u00a338.3bn compared with the original total estimate of \u00a335.4bn. The cost overrun would have paid for 15 destroyers or 40 minehunters, the MoD confessed to the committee. The average delay in the projects has slipped to more than three-and-a-half-years.

Minehead was put in Devon rather than Somerset in Play dough, page 16, Jobs and Money, August 12. The same article needlessly rechristened the so-called English Riviera on the south-west coast as the British Riviera. The US gymnast who collapsed at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games was Kerri Strug, not Shrug, as given on page 7, Sport, August 14. A Diary item on the Yelverton Paperweight Centre yesterday, page 20, associated Sir Francis Drake with potatoes. It was Sir Walter Raleigh who in legend (largely discredited) brought the potato to the British Isles. And the paperweight centre is on Dartmoor, not in Dartmouth. Amelia Earhart's plane was was lost over the Atlantic in 1937, according to a BBC2 TV listing on page 24, G2, August 10. It was the south Pacific.

      "bodyText": "When the news broke shortly before 4pm on July 25 that an Air France Concorde had plunged from the skies above Paris just moments after take-off, the top brass at Waterside, British Airways' Heathrow headquarters, knew they had little choice but to cancel their next flight. There were less than two hours to go before the BA003 flight taxied down the runway bound for JFK, New York, and the news of the Paris tragedy would begin to filter through to passengers arriving at the Concorde lounge in Terminal 4. In fact when BA announced at 5.25pm that it was taking the unprecedented step of grounding the supersonic jet, passengers were already aware of the disaster. \"I was very apprehensive,\" admitted one who had been steeling himself to join the flight when the announcement came just half an hour before take-off. \"I had not made up my mind about whether to board it.\" For the directors and technical flight specialists hastily assembled in the boardroom less than a mile from the airport, and under Concorde's flight path, chancing a flight was a risk they could not contemplate. \"There was very little discussion,\" said one BA official. \"Both out of respect for those 113 who died, and because we simply didn't have any reasonable information at that point on which to make a decision.\" Both flights due that day, the 17.55 and the 18.45 from New York, were suspended but, in announcing its decision, BA gave no indication this would be anything but temporary. In a statement, the airline stressed: \"We will be holding discussions with our technical counterparts at Air France and reviewing tomorrow's operations overnight.\" And, when morning came, it appeared to be business as usual for the British limb of the Anglo-French Concorde partnership: Air France might have indefinitely grounded its five remaining planes, a move which now looks increasingly permanent, but in London the BA001 10.30 flight took off as usual, albeit with just 37 passengers. The decision was criticised by Jean-Pierre Blazy, the mayor of Gonesse, where the Concorde came down. As the town held a silent march to commemorate the 113 dead, he accused BA of showing \"indecent haste\" in resuming its service. \"It is imperative that Concorde remains grounded,\" he railed. \"I deplore the decision by the British to continue flying.\" Accused of being insensitive in putting economic preoccupations above the feelings of the victims' families, the airline last night remained unrepentant. \"We have the utmost respect for the victims and their relatives but we saw no reason and we haven't had any subsequent notification of any by the Civil Aviation Authority before today to suggest we should suspend our operations,\" BA said. But, as more details emerged of safety checks ordered by Christian Marty, the captain of the ill-fated AF4590, as well as of a safety record that appeared less pristine than previously noted, the public perception of Concorde's safety all but disappeared. And, in an atmosphere of increasing paranoia, BA was forced to admit earlier this month that it had had four Concorde scares in as many days. On August 1 a back-up Concorde had to be used after one scheduled to fly to New York was taken out of service at the last minute for further adjustments to engine work carried out at the weekend. Emergency alert Another plane was grounded indefinitely after cracks were found in wing frames, while another prompted a full emergency alert at Heathrow when it reported a problem with an engine BA later dismissed as \"no more serious than a car backfiring\". In the most serious incident, on July 30, a Concorde bound for New York was diverted to Gander, Canada, after passengers complained of smelling fuel in the cabin. \"It was purely a precautionary measure,\" said BA spokeswoman Jemma Moore. Within a couple of days just two of BA's seven-strong fleet were in service, but officials refused to concede there were serious problems with the ageing crafts and insisted they were being \"exceptionally vigilant at the moment\". That vigilance, BA said yesterday, was reflected in increasingly extensive checks made on each plane and daily discussions with accident investigators conducting the 18-month inquiry into the Paris disaster. \"Since the accident we have liaised on a daily basis with all the regulatory authorities involved and we have acted on any information available to us. At no such point were we provided with any facts or information that lead us or the CAA to question the safety of our fleet or the decision to continue operations,\" said BA spokesman Peter Middleton. Before the crash four engineers inspected the exterior and engines of each Concorde about to fly as well as testing the brakes and tyre wear. Similar checks on the engine oil levels, tyre pressure, external lighting and emergency cabin equipment were conducted after each flight, with a more intense examination of the oil levels, windows and cabin interiors after every 30 flying hours. But last night BA admitted the checks were brief - \"we're not talking hours\" - and said that, following the tragedy, they had been stepped up in length, thoroughness and intensity. \"An extensive series of additional procedures and checks on the aircrafts' airframe, engines, tyres and wheels, hydraulics and other systems and operating procedures\" were carried out after the crash, Mr Middleton added, refusing to go into greater detail. In the end, no amount of checking or fevered reassurance could prevent the discovery of what appears to be a structural flaw, and when the air accidents investigation bureau rang BA at 10am yesterday to warn it the CAA would be grounding its Concordes the next day, the airline's decision was even more clear-cut than in the immediate aftermath of the crash. A call was made to the CAA to confirm that the certificate of airworthiness would indeed be taken away, and then to the captain of flight BA001, who by this stage was taxiing towards the runway, in readiness for the 10.30am take-off. The plane stopped, and the passengers heard they must disembark to meet a BA director. His message was simple: Concorde's services had been indefinitely withdrawn. Timetable: Three weeks of uncertainty July 25 All Concorde flights grounded after flight AF4590 crashes into a hotel in the Paris suburb of Gonesse, killing 113 people. BA's two evening Concorde services do not fly. July 26 BA Concorde services resume while France orders indefinite suspension of all Air France Concorde flights. Crash investigation initially centres on the engines. July 27 French air accident investigators say the crew of the crashed Concorde had problems with both port engines and were unable to retract the undercarriage. July 28 Investigators reveal that \"certainly one, and possibly two\" of the tyres on the left hand side of the supersonic jet shattered before the crash. July 29 Concorde suffers three safety scares in one weekend. A BA Concorde flight bound for Heathrow from New York suffers a mixture of fuel and air in the engine, causing a loud bang inside the jet. July 30 A BA Concorde is prevented from taking off because of a refuelling problem. On the same day 57 passengers are stranded at Gander, Newfoundland, after their New York-bound flight is forced to divert when smell of fuel is detected in the cabin. August 1 A BA Concorde is taken out of service for \"minor adjustments\" shortly before it was due to leave Heathrow. Its 33 passengers are switched to a back-up Concorde. August 9 A study of Concorde's engines carried out before the crash found 55 \"significant risks\", it is revealed. New Scientist magazine reports it has seen details of the study which showed some of the risks could lead to \"catastrophic problems\" including uncontrolled fire and multiple engine failure. August 10 Investigators say the crash was probably caused by a punctured tyre. A strip of metal found on the runway pierced the jet's tyre. Fragments probably then shot into fuel reservoirs.

It would be unfortunate if, as a result of the failure of the Hyder case, such action was to become the rule, rather than the exception it should be - even under the new regime.",

Accusing the Conservative leader of \"trying to hitch on to the Bush bandwagon\" in the US presidential race, Mr Prescott said that Mr Hague was resorting to the \"old Tory way\" of stoking up \"fear of foreigners, particularly of our fellow-Europeans\", and \"prejudice and bigotry towards any known minority, no matter who they hurt\". Labour wants to prevent Mr Hague repositioning himself as a more caring figure, now that he has consolidated his hold on core Tory voters. Speaking in Enfield, north London, Mr Prescott urged grassroots activists to keep hammering away at the \u00a3163.24m per constituency cuts which Labour says a Hague government would make. Conservative HQ immediately retaliated in kind, pointing to a sharp rise in out-patient waiting lists in Enfield, a 12.6 % rise in London crime, and the poor state of Enfield's education services. The deputy prime minister - in charge during the Blair family holiday - had made a foray into suburban Enfield, where Labour now holds all three seats, including the former constituency of Michael Portillo, who lost Southgate to Stephen Twigg in 1997. Addressing party activists with Mr Twigg at his side, he repeatedly urged them to get out and sell Labour's message to voters who did not know it - or who misunderstood the details of the government's much-criticised pensions package. It was far more generous, Mr Prescott insisted, than the basic 75p a week rise and included a tax-free \u00a3163.3 a week towards winter fuel costs. A question and answer session revealed a mixture of praise and complaint from activists, evidently wary of recent Tory poll gains and the government's disarray, but also concerned that voters \"feel we've deserted them a bit\" on transport policy, pensions and other public services. An ebullient Mr Prescott, keen to disappoint Tory tabloids on the Prescott gaffe-watch, admitted that Gordon Brown's initial adherence to Tory spending plans meant that \"in the first two years ... we took a bit of stick, but we were taking a long term view\" to deliver social justice from the proceeds of a strong economy.",

Armed with a captured rifle almost as big as himself, he accompanied the women who regularly crossed the Apennines on foot to carry food from Parma, Reggio or Modena, some 150 miles away, back to the starving inhabitants of his Tuscan birthplace, Massa di Carrara. In 1944, he was adopted as a mascot by the Costrignano Brigade, and, in that role, entered Modena as standard-bearer on its liberation in April 1945.</p> <p>Fiaschi, who has died aged 69, was one of the youngest of the generation of anti- fascist partisans who fought against Mussolini's rule in Italy and Franco in Spain.</p> <p>The natives of Carrara are reputedly descendants of Phoenician slaves who quarried marble for Rome. The city is also the cradle of Italian anarchism and a historical centre of rebellion. The fascist years in Italy, from 1922 onwards, were particularly bitter in Carrara. The city itself was twice liberated from the Nazis by anarchist partisans prior to the arrival of allied troops</p> <p>After the liberation, Fiaschi returned to the quarries, where he had worked from the age of eight, alongside his father and uncle. By the early 1950s, he was involved with the Spanish refugee committee and became friendly with Jose Lluis Facerias, a veteran Spanish anarchist of the Ascaso column in the Spanish civil war, who had been freed from a Francoist jail in 1945 and had lived illegally in Carrara since 1952.</p> <p>In August 1957, the two men crossed the Pyrenees on bicycles to join the guerrilla struggle against Francoism. They were detected within a fort night; Fiaschi was arrested in a forest hideout and Facerias murdered in a guardia civile ambush in the Barcelona suburbs. After beatings and torture, Fiaschi was brought before a military court in August 1958, where he was sentenced to 20 years and one day in jail.</p> <p>For more than a decade, in 40 Spanish prisons, Fiaschi sent thousands of postcards, decorated with precisely detailed paintings, to friends and acquaintances. I met him first in one of those jails, and I was to receive those cards throughout the 35 years of our friendship, the last of which arrived only a few weeks be fore his death. With amnesties, he was released in 1966.</p> <p>He returned to Italy to serve a 10-year prison sentence - passed in absentia, without his knowledge, without any notification of the charges and without representation in court. This conviction was for alleged involvement in a 1957 bank robbery in Monferrato with Facerias. Following an international campaign, he was finally released from prison after 17 years in March 1974.</p> <p>Fiaschi became a key figure in the local anarchist movement. He ran a bookshop and cultural circle, and was a prime mover in the occupa tion of the Germinal Centre located, embarrassingly for the city fathers, in the most prestigious building in Carrara's main square. Occupied by anarchist partisans during the liberation in 1945, the building had been the defiant focus of anarchist activity until 1990, when the local authority finally wrested it back.</p> <p>After last year's May Day celebrations in Carrara, which he had always helped organise, Fiaschi announced that he was terminally ill and was preparing to end his life.

      "bodyText": "In 1943, the young Italian anarchist, Goliardo Fiaschi, falsified his birth certificate - to make himself seem older than his 13 years - and joined the wartime Italian partisans. Armed with a captured rifle almost as big as himself, he accompanied the women who regularly crossed the Apennines on foot to carry food from Parma, Reggio or Modena, some 150 miles away, back to the starving inhabitants of his Tuscan birthplace, Massa di Carrara. In 1944, he was adopted as a mascot by the Costrignano Brigade, and, in that role, entered Modena as standard-bearer on its liberation in April 1945. Fiaschi, who has died aged 69, was one of the youngest of the generation of anti- fascist partisans who fought against Mussolini's rule in Italy and Franco in Spain. The natives of Carrara are reputedly descendants of Phoenician slaves who quarried marble for Rome. The city is also the cradle of Italian anarchism and a historical centre of rebellion. The fascist years in Italy, from 1922 onwards, were particularly bitter in Carrara. The city itself was twice liberated from the Nazis by anarchist partisans prior to the arrival of allied troops After the liberation, Fiaschi returned to the quarries, where he had worked from the age of eight, alongside his father and uncle. By the early 1950s, he was involved with the Spanish refugee committee and became friendly with Jose Lluis Facerias, a veteran Spanish anarchist of the Ascaso column in the Spanish civil war, who had been freed from a Francoist jail in 1945 and had lived illegally in Carrara since 1952. In August 1957, the two men crossed the Pyrenees on bicycles to join the guerrilla struggle against Francoism. They were detected within a fort night; Fiaschi was arrested in a forest hideout and Facerias murdered in a guardia civile ambush in the Barcelona suburbs. After beatings and torture, Fiaschi was brought before a military court in August 1958, where he was sentenced to 20 years and one day in jail. For more than a decade, in 40 Spanish prisons, Fiaschi sent thousands of postcards, decorated with precisely detailed paintings, to friends and acquaintances. I met him first in one of those jails, and I was to receive those cards throughout the 35 years of our friendship, the last of which arrived only a few weeks be fore his death. With amnesties, he was released in 1966. He returned to Italy to serve a 10-year prison sentence - passed in absentia, without his knowledge, without any notification of the charges and without representation in court. This conviction was for alleged involvement in a 1957 bank robbery in Monferrato with Facerias. Following an international campaign, he was finally released from prison after 17 years in March 1974. Fiaschi became a key figure in the local anarchist movement. He ran a bookshop and cultural circle, and was a prime mover in the occupa tion of the Germinal Centre located, embarrassingly for the city fathers, in the most prestigious building in Carrara's main square. Occupied by anarchist partisans during the liberation in 1945, the building had been the defiant focus of anarchist activity until 1990, when the local authority finally wrested it back. After last year's May Day celebrations in Carrara, which he had always helped organise, Fiaschi announced that he was terminally ill and was preparing to end his life. Persuaded to shelve this plan, instead he went into hospital saying: \"There was a time when suicide would have been the right thing. I could have left my body to science and for the advancement of medicine. Now, I must surrender myself alive, so they can study me. I realise they will carry out all sorts of experiments on me, but, since my death is inevitable anyway, I will try to be equal to the task.\" Brought home after 14 months in a cancer ward, Fiaschi died the following day. His coffin was borne around the town on the shoulders of friends, followed by a band, and anarchists from all over Italy carrying red and black flags. He was laid to rest beside Gino Lucetti and Steffano Vatteroni, both would- be assassins of Mussolini, and Giuseppe Pinelli, who was defenestrated from police headquarters in Milan in 1969. Such was the esteem in which Goliardo Fiaschi was held that even the ranks of Tuscany, in the person of the mayor of Carrara, could scarce forbear to cheer with a farewell notice, which ended with the words: \"Thanks, Goliardo!\" He is survived by his sister. \u0095 Goliardo Fiaschi, anarchist, born August 21 1930; died July 29 2000",

In the 1950s, he attacked Alfred Kinsey's research on sexual behaviour, the conclusions of which he believed were seriously flawed because they relied on a sample of people who knew each other. Tukey said a random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Kinsey.</p> <p>In the 1970s, Tukey chaired a research committee that warned of the damage to the ozone layer from aerosol sprays. More recently, he recommended that the 1990 US census be adjusted by statistical formulae to compensate for the huge numbers of poor urban residents whom he believed it had missed. Always eager to apply statistics to new questions, from 1960 to 1980 he helped design the polls used by the NBC television network to predict and analyse American elections.</p> <p>Tukey was born the only son of teachers in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His parents believed his talent would be best developed if he was educated at home, so his formal education began only when he entered Brown University, at Providence, Rhode Island. He graduated with a first in mathematics and chemistry and, in 1937, went to Princeton, where he obtained a PhD in mathematics in 1939 for a thesis on denumerability in topology.</p> <p>During the second world war, he was engaged on strategic research that involved statistics, work he found fascinating, especially since it involved rubbing shoulders with other statisticians recruited to Princeton for the war effort. In particular, he met William Cochran, the brilliant Cambridge mathematician, who had moved to the US.</p> <p>For Tukey, this was the start of a long and fruitful exchange of ideas with Cochran and other senior researchers. In 1945, he was offered a post in statistics within the mathematics department at Princeton, and, at the age of 35, was made a full professor. In 1965, he became founding chairman of Princeton's statistics department. One post was not, however, enough to absorb his energy, and, in 1945, he also joined Bell Laboratories.</p> <p>The modern science of statistics is more than 100 years old. Tukey believed that, after the first 40 years, its practitioners lost sight of its original objectives of finding methods of analysing data that described patterns, trends, and relationships, and detected anomalies. In 1962, he maintained that mathematical statistics was ignoring real-world data analysis. He urged a return to the origins of scientific statistics, using modern methods in which the statistical description of the data was paramount.</p> <p>Tukey proved his case by developing exploratory data analysis, a philosophy that returned to the original goals of statistics, but relied on modern computer methods. It is now a widely accepted technique, due, in large part, to the growth in desktop computers and the explosion of data for which traditional statistics is not suitable.</p> <p>With an emphasis on graphic display, it initially gave mathematicians new ways to analyse and present data clearly. More refined versions of the technique let people with no statistical expertise discover what patterns, relationships or trends might lie hidden in the data they needed to examine.</p> <p>One of those tools, the stem-and-leaf display, remains in the high school curriculum. Students use the technique to arrange a series of data points in rows and columns, and then make judgments about what techniques - such as calculating the average or median - would allow them to analyse the information intelligently. The method of displaying data confirmed Tukey's belief that mathematicians should start with their data, and then look for a theorem to interpret it.</p> <p>Over the years, he became a hub for regular scientific meetings of a group of Princeton professors, including Lyman Spitzer, who inspired the Hubble space telescope. In his work on the philosophy of statistics and of research, Tukey balanced the usefulness and limitation of mathematical statistics.</p> <p>Tukey had no immediate survivors. Elizabeth, his wife of 48 years, died in 1998.</p> <p>\u0095 John Wilder Tukey, mathematician, born June 16 1915; died July 26 2000</p>",

In 1965, he became founding chairman of Princeton's statistics department. One post was not, however, enough to absorb his energy, and, in 1945, he also joined Bell Laboratories. The modern science of statistics is more than 100 years old. Tukey believed that, after the first 40 years, its practitioners lost sight of its original objectives of finding methods of analysing data that described patterns, trends, and relationships, and detected anomalies. In 1962, he maintained that mathematical statistics was ignoring real-world data analysis. He urged a return to the origins of scientific statistics, using modern methods in which the statistical description of the data was paramount. Tukey proved his case by developing exploratory data analysis, a philosophy that returned to the original goals of statistics, but relied on modern computer methods. It is now a widely accepted technique, due, in large part, to the growth in desktop computers and the explosion of data for which traditional statistics is not suitable. With an emphasis on graphic display, it initially gave mathematicians new ways to analyse and present data clearly. More refined versions of the technique let people with no statistical expertise discover what patterns, relationships or trends might lie hidden in the data they needed to examine. One of those tools, the stem-and-leaf display, remains in the high school curriculum. Students use the technique to arrange a series of data points in rows and columns, and then make judgments about what techniques - such as calculating the average or median - would allow them to analyse the information intelligently. The method of displaying data confirmed Tukey's belief that mathematicians should start with their data, and then look for a theorem to interpret it. Over the years, he became a hub for regular scientific meetings of a group of Princeton professors, including Lyman Spitzer, who inspired the Hubble space telescope. In his work on the philosophy of statistics and of research, Tukey balanced the usefulness and limitation of mathematical statistics. Tukey had no immediate survivors. Elizabeth, his wife of 48 years, died in 1998. \u0095 John Wilder Tukey, mathematician, born June 16 1915; died July 26 2000",

      "byline": "Emma Brockes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Charlotte Uhlenbroek's appearance on television tonight has been sold as a tantalising new chapter in wildlife documentary. In the three-part series, called Cousins, the 33-year-old zoologist promises to make some startling revelations about the monkey world. But this isn't what's got critics gasping for oxygen like expiring fish. The combination of Uhlenbroek's youth, her PhD and her long, swishy hair has proved too much for certain elements of the press, who have heralded her as the \"sexy new female David Attenborough\", and, more desperately, \"the new Charlie Dimmock\". </p> <p>In mannerism, in fact, Uhlenbroek is more like David Bellamy, wriggling about in her chair and flexing her hands as she strives to communicate her passion for primates. She is not glamorously dressed, but in baggy jeans and big trainers befitting a woman who spent four years in a shack in the Burundian jungle, monitoring chimpanzee behaviour. Her hair, however, shoulder-length and wavering, is emphatically impractical and when asked if she resents the slant of the pre-programme coverage, she looks cheekily delighted. \"I've heard mention that I'm going to do for primates what Charlie Dimmock did for water features, and that's fine. I think Charlie is absolutely great, I think she's very natural and enthusiastic about her subject.\" Uhlenbroek quickly adds, \"Of course, I wouldn't like the focus to shift off the wildlife too much.\" </p> <p>Just as Dimmock shone like a rare orchid beside the dumpy Alan Titchmarsh, so Uhlenbroek's on-screen glamour gains much from the fact that her only competition is a bunch of apes. Her energy and obvious love for her subject are, however, genuinely attractive. On several occasions, she almost levitates out of the chair with the excitement of explaining the habits of a particular species. \"There's a tendency to think of chimps as amusing caricatures of humans,\" she says, leaning urgently forward. \"But they are sophisticated animals in their own right. Although the development of chimps and humans is comparable in primitive terms until about the age of three, after that we go our separate ways.\" It is her aim in Cousins to explain where the two species run into each other again, and by doing so, to shed light on the fundamental question of what it means to be human. </p> <p>Uhlenbroek's first encounter with a primate came when she was 15 and on holiday in Tanzania, although it was not her first encounter with the jungle. She is well qualified to spend long stretches in distant lands, because her childhood left her with indistinct notions of home. Her Dutch father, an agricultural specialist for the United Nations, and her English mother, brought her up in Kathmandu, Nepal, before moving to Tanzania when Uhlenbroek was 14 and sending her to boarding school in England. </p> <p>\"I suppose that culturally, I am mostly English. I've spent a lot of time in English schools. Even when I was in Nepal I was at an American school. I've never lived in Holland, and although I'm proud of my roots there, I can't say that I'm culturally Dutch. But in terms of where I'm at home, I am a bit of a nomad. It means that I feel at home in most places.\" </p> <p>The emotional investment she makes in her research projects is such that, the first time she touched down in Burundi, she felt the euphoria one only gets on returning home. \"I had never been to Burundi before, but I had the feeling that I was happy to be home.\" It was the culmination of seven years' work in the footsteps of her role model, Jane Goodall. Uhlenbroek was introduced to Goodall at the age of 15 whilst out in Tanzania.

      "bodyText": "Charlotte Uhlenbroek's appearance on television tonight has been sold as a tantalising new chapter in wildlife documentary. In the three-part series, called Cousins, the 33-year-old zoologist promises to make some startling revelations about the monkey world. But this isn't what's got critics gasping for oxygen like expiring fish. The combination of Uhlenbroek's youth, her PhD and her long, swishy hair has proved too much for certain elements of the press, who have heralded her as the \"sexy new female David Attenborough\", and, more desperately, \"the new Charlie Dimmock\". In mannerism, in fact, Uhlenbroek is more like David Bellamy, wriggling about in her chair and flexing her hands as she strives to communicate her passion for primates. She is not glamorously dressed, but in baggy jeans and big trainers befitting a woman who spent four years in a shack in the Burundian jungle, monitoring chimpanzee behaviour. Her hair, however, shoulder-length and wavering, is emphatically impractical and when asked if she resents the slant of the pre-programme coverage, she looks cheekily delighted. \"I've heard mention that I'm going to do for primates what Charlie Dimmock did for water features, and that's fine. I think Charlie is absolutely great, I think she's very natural and enthusiastic about her subject.\" Uhlenbroek quickly adds, \"Of course, I wouldn't like the focus to shift off the wildlife too much.\" Just as Dimmock shone like a rare orchid beside the dumpy Alan Titchmarsh, so Uhlenbroek's on-screen glamour gains much from the fact that her only competition is a bunch of apes. Her energy and obvious love for her subject are, however, genuinely attractive. On several occasions, she almost levitates out of the chair with the excitement of explaining the habits of a particular species. \"There's a tendency to think of chimps as amusing caricatures of humans,\" she says, leaning urgently forward. \"But they are sophisticated animals in their own right. Although the development of chimps and humans is comparable in primitive terms until about the age of three, after that we go our separate ways.\" It is her aim in Cousins to explain where the two species run into each other again, and by doing so, to shed light on the fundamental question of what it means to be human. Uhlenbroek's first encounter with a primate came when she was 15 and on holiday in Tanzania, although it was not her first encounter with the jungle. She is well qualified to spend long stretches in distant lands, because her childhood left her with indistinct notions of home. Her Dutch father, an agricultural specialist for the United Nations, and her English mother, brought her up in Kathmandu, Nepal, before moving to Tanzania when Uhlenbroek was 14 and sending her to boarding school in England. \"I suppose that culturally, I am mostly English. I've spent a lot of time in English schools. Even when I was in Nepal I was at an American school. I've never lived in Holland, and although I'm proud of my roots there, I can't say that I'm culturally Dutch. But in terms of where I'm at home, I am a bit of a nomad. It means that I feel at home in most places.\" The emotional investment she makes in her research projects is such that, the first time she touched down in Burundi, she felt the euphoria one only gets on returning home. \"I had never been to Burundi before, but I had the feeling that I was happy to be home.\" It was the culmination of seven years' work in the footsteps of her role model, Jane Goodall. Uhlenbroek was introduced to Goodall at the age of 15 whilst out in Tanzania. The groundbreaking primatologist had struck the young Uhlenbroek as \"extraordinary\", and the job she was doing, monitoring primate communities, as \"fantastic\". When she left school, Uhlenbroek enrolled for a bachelor's degree in zoology and psychology at Bristol University, then got a job as a researcher in the BBC's natural history unit in Bristol. It was while she was there that, one evening at the pub, a colleague casually asked if she'd heard that Jane Goodall was looking for volunteers to set up a primate project in Burundi. \"I literally left my beer on the table and headed straight for the payphone and rang her.

Isn't that a bit naughty? Not if you call it art. The image used on the cover was actually an \"airbrush painting\" based on Gisele and Daphna. So is there something wrong with Gisele's body, then? Not that we're aware of. They just didn't have quite the right shots of her. You mean they couldn't afford her. Neither could you - she charges up to \u00a3250,000 for a day's work. Still, Daphna's not a bad substitute. Her proportions match Gisele's exactly, from the 32C bust downwards. And her mum's from Argentina. The \"boobs from Buenos Aires\", you could say. I suppose you could. Shame the fluffy dog ruins the image. Quite the opposite. Gisele's got one too. Daphna's destined for the catwalk herself, no doubt. Actually she's a law graduate, and her real ambitions lie in journalism. Can she write? Who cares? Don't be pathetically laddish. She's obviously very intelligent. Not to mention rich. Her German dad's a property magnate. Do say: \"I think the A3 tray's out of paper.\" Don't say: \"You're very beautiful, you know. You should be a model.\" Not to be confused with: Who do you think?",

It was just three weeks since the breaching of the Berlin Wall. Around the world politicians, diplomats and ordinary people were struggling to come to terms with what that could mean, given Germany's grim wartime history. Reunification was far from a foregone conclusion. Mr Kohl said: \"Nobody knows now what a reunited Germany will look like. But I am sure that unity will come if the German people want it.\" Less than a year later, on October 3 1990, the former East Germany rejoined the federal republic - and the skill and decisiveness with which Mr Kohl managed the reunification and cajoled fellow world leaders into endorsing it appeared to secure his reputation as a great statesmen. He could scarcely have believed then that a decade later his standing would have fallen so far that he could not even attend the 10th anniversary of his greatest achievement. But he has decided to stay away from the next month's ceremony to spare everyone's blushes. Since last November he was been embroiled in a still-unresolved controversy which has shown that he and his party took millions of pounds worth of illegal party contributions. A parliamentary commission of inquiry is examining whether the secret donations were made in exchange for favours from his government. Mr Kohl vehemently denies that allegation, but by his decision to stay away he has tacitly admitted that he is no longer a celebrity, but an embarrassment. He said on Monday that he would not attend the 10th German Unity Day celebrations, in order to end a row over whether he should take part. He had been invited as a guest to the event, in Dresden, but was not invited to speak - an omission that brought complaints from other politicians. Nevertheless, as German commentators noted yesterday, by his actions Mr Kohl has kept open divisions in his own party, the Christian Democrats (CDU), and shown that he retains the power to cause serious trouble for its new leader, Angela Merkel. The decision not to allow him to speak was taken by Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat leader of the state government in Saxony, of which Dresden is the capital. He was a leading critic of Mr Kohl, and Mr Kohl, a formidable party wheeler-dealer, reacted by derailing Mr Biedenkopf's political career. Mr Biedenkopf's attitude drew criticism from Kohl loyalists and even an implied rebuke from the party's new general secretary, Ruprecht Polenz, who said: \"Personally, I would have welcomed it if Kohl had given a speech in Dresden.\" A ruling for or against the decision had been expected from Ms Merkel, who incurred Mr Kohl's wrath herself by being the first leading Christian Democrat to distance herself from him as the scandal unfolded. By taking the issue out of her hands, the Mr Kohl has not only strengthened his own reputation for decisiveness but reinforced the growing suspicion that indecision is Ms Merkel's achilles heel. The centre-left Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel said yesterday: \"The CDU has still not made clear its relationship with its erstwhile patriarch . . . Merkel wants to step out of Kohl's shadow, but the party is reluctant to let her. And Kohl even more so.\" His reputation may be in ruins, but Mr Kohl's capacity for mischief remains immense.",

The current proposal to accept a more liberal air services agreement in return for permitting alliances between airlines in order to allow UK airlines to gain access to the US domestic market may lead to a deal in the short term, but such a deal should include a clear timetable for the lifting of US restrictions on cabotage and airline ownership and Fly America policy,\" says the report. </p> <p>Only a handful of carriers, such as British Airways and Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, are allowed to operate transatlantic services into and out of Heathrow airport. British carriers have restrictions on US destinations. The report says a new agreement will bring advantages to Britain's airlines, consumers and the economy as a whole.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs yesterday attacked the United States for its \"intransigence\"on a new \"open skies\" policy for flights between Britain and America. A report from the Commons environment, transport and regional affairs committee has called for the US to change existing legislation which gives its own airlines priority within the US. \"The United States has proved to be intransigent about its domestic legislation relating to cabotage - reserving internal flights to US carriers - to airline ownership and Fly America. The current proposal to accept a more liberal air services agreement in return for permitting alliances between airlines in order to allow UK airlines to gain access to the US domestic market may lead to a deal in the short term, but such a deal should include a clear timetable for the lifting of US restrictions on cabotage and airline ownership and Fly America policy,\" says the report. Only a handful of carriers, such as British Airways and Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, are allowed to operate transatlantic services into and out of Heathrow airport. British carriers have restrictions on US destinations. The report says a new agreement will bring advantages to Britain's airlines, consumers and the economy as a whole.",

Dagmara Stanek, 25, from the Baltic resort of Sopot, emitted a scream of just over 126 decibels, equivalent to the noise of a large pneumatic hammer or a racing car travelling at top speed, the organisers of Sunday's event said. She outscreamed a male rival, Pawel Dabrowski, 35, from Warsaw, who produced a five-second scream of 125.3 decibels, defending his 1999 title of best male screamer. Europe's only vocal noise competition, modelled on an annual screaming festival in Japan, took place in the town of Goldap in Poland's northeastern lake district, and was broadcast live on state television. The contestants ranged in age from a girl of four to a man of 74, and came from Poland, the US, the Czech Republic and Austria. \"We allowed them to scream greetings like 'I love you' or 'I like you' . . . the only restriction was they were not allowed to swear,\" said the director, Andrzej Sokolowski, who has organised the contest for the past four years with the Goldap Sports Council. One young Polish man, he said, used the occasion to propose to his girlfriend. \"The Austrians were the most musical,\" he added, \"probably due to their yodelling tradition.\" Ms Stanek said she planned to defend her title again next year. \"This comes from practising screaming every day down by the lakes,\" she said. \"I'm not married yet, but when I am I'll be able to try this out on my husband and improve still further.\" Mr Dabrowski said his friends were shocked when he discovered his talent. \"I'm a placid man at heart, but I must admit this is a good way to vent my frustrations,\" he said. The winners each took home a colour television set, and Ms Dagmara received a bonus prize of a live 20kg (44lb) turkey. The judges measured the highest scream level of each contestant with equipment normally used by environmental inspectors to check noisy workplaces and neighbours. Mr Sokolowski said he hoped to persuade representatives of the Guinness Book of Records to record the results at next year's competition. Following the success of his screaming competition, Mr Sokolowski established an annual beer drinking contest, Heis also behind Poland's first kissing championship, to be held in Goldap in October.",

      "body": "<p>What should an airline do if its staff is in revolt, its performance has nosedived and nobody believes that its multi-billion dollar acquisition of a rival will succeed? </p> <p>United Airlines, the world's largest carrier with 2,330 flights a day, has decided that the answer is to spend $500,000 on funding this week's Democratic party convention in Los Angeles. </p> <p>The US company has been hit with a wave of bad news in the past week. Few analysts expect it to be in party spirit in spite of its generosity. Several Wall Street analysts downgraded the company's third quarter earnings estimates last week after the carrier warned that its union troubles and cancelled flights would cost at least $50m this year. </p> <p>The company has cut its September flight schedule by 3%, about 2,000 trips, citing bad weather, air traffic control issues and the unsolved dispute with its powerful pilots' union over a new contract. More than 1,000 flights were cancelled last week. United's 10,000 pilots, who together with other staff members own more than half of the company, are refusing to fly overtime. </p> <p><strong> Generosity</strong><br> </p> <p>The argument between the two sides has become more heated. United blames staff for an increase in sick days off and maintenance calls, while the unions say the company does not want to take on more pilots, which, they maintain, it desperately needs. </p> <p>The dispute is taking its toll on the company. In the first week of August fewer than 40% of United's domestic flights arrived within 15 minutes of their schedule, down from 57% in May, when the company announced its proposed $4.3bn acquisition of US Airways. Amid such turmoil, United's position as the tenth largest contributor of \"in-kind\" money to this week's Democratic convention may appear odd. The connection between the US airline industry and the country's political establishment has always been close. United, American Airlines and Northwest are among the top 70 corporate political donors in the US this year while US Airways, United's intended partner, was a significant donor to the Republican party convention. </p> <p>None of this generosity is directed at any particular issue, though the industry does need political favour to consolidate. In the last few weeks United has appointed former deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes to help its lobbying efforts. Mr Ickes has been an adviser to Hillary Clinton in the New York Senate race. </p> <p>United's attempt to buy US Airways, the smallest of the six main US carriers, needs regulatory approval from the department of justice. One Washington source said yesterday Mr Ickes's \"heavyweight appointment\" could help United win support for its proposed acquisition. </p> <p>It also needs to convince individual politicians in the Senate that the merger will improve current levels of service, and not lead to job cuts or fewer flights. </p> <p>At Senate hearings in June, United argued that the merger would improve service. But politicians, who were not convinced by the airline, took turns to ask what the merger meant for their constituency. One government official described the hearings as a \"public dance\". </p> <p>The head of Mercer Management Consulting's global aviation practice Peter Walsh says the merger should go ahead. \"I think some consolidation has to be good for the industry,\" he says. It would benefit both parties. It would allow United to route some of its flights through US Airways' east coast hubs rather than Chicago, which is renowned for air traffic control delays. It would also permit the smaller company to use the international network, says Mr Walsh. </p> <p>Others, such as employees and some politicians, are less sanguine about the plans. They fear it would lead to other mergers and regional monopolies. At the earlier Senate hearings, John Conyers, a senior Democrat on the House judiciary committee, said: \"We've already seen the creation of non-competitive markets in many cities ... I'm concerned that the United-US Airways merger could trigger a spate of other airline mergers.\" </p> <p>Such fears were exacerbated by takeover talks between American, Northwest, Delta and Continental after United announced its acquisition plans. </p> <p>British Airways, keen to do a deal with American, and KLM, which has an alliance with Northwest, also entered the takeover scene in June. The US and UK governments will be discussing transatlantic flights next month in London. </p> <p>United's unions scuppered the last attempt at a merger between the company and US Airways in 1995. In May this year, the Airline Pilots Association at United expressed its \"strong concerns\" about the current deal. </p> <p>Wall Street's arbitrage traders are already betting that the deal will not go ahead. Shares in US Airways were trading at about $37 yesterday, well below the $60 a share offered by United. </p> <p>United and US Airways remain confident that their deal with gain approval. </p> <p>Few analysts believe that any decision will be forthcoming before the Presidential elections, for political as well as corpporate reasons.</p>",

More than 1,000 flights were cancelled last week. United's 10,000 pilots, who together with other staff members own more than half of the company, are refusing to fly overtime. Generosity The argument between the two sides has become more heated. United blames staff for an increase in sick days off and maintenance calls, while the unions say the company does not want to take on more pilots, which, they maintain, it desperately needs. The dispute is taking its toll on the company. In the first week of August fewer than 40% of United's domestic flights arrived within 15 minutes of their schedule, down from 57% in May, when the company announced its proposed $4.3bn acquisition of US Airways. Amid such turmoil, United's position as the tenth largest contributor of \"in-kind\" money to this week's Democratic convention may appear odd. The connection between the US airline industry and the country's political establishment has always been close. United, American Airlines and Northwest are among the top 70 corporate political donors in the US this year while US Airways, United's intended partner, was a significant donor to the Republican party convention. None of this generosity is directed at any particular issue, though the industry does need political favour to consolidate. In the last few weeks United has appointed former deputy White House chief of staff Harold Ickes to help its lobbying efforts. Mr Ickes has been an adviser to Hillary Clinton in the New York Senate race. United's attempt to buy US Airways, the smallest of the six main US carriers, needs regulatory approval from the department of justice. One Washington source said yesterday Mr Ickes's \"heavyweight appointment\" could help United win support for its proposed acquisition. It also needs to convince individual politicians in the Senate that the merger will improve current levels of service, and not lead to job cuts or fewer flights. At Senate hearings in June, United argued that the merger would improve service. But politicians, who were not convinced by the airline, took turns to ask what the merger meant for their constituency. One government official described the hearings as a \"public dance\". The head of Mercer Management Consulting's global aviation practice Peter Walsh says the merger should go ahead. \"I think some consolidation has to be good for the industry,\" he says. It would benefit both parties. It would allow United to route some of its flights through US Airways' east coast hubs rather than Chicago, which is renowned for air traffic control delays. It would also permit the smaller company to use the international network, says Mr Walsh. Others, such as employees and some politicians, are less sanguine about the plans. They fear it would lead to other mergers and regional monopolies. At the earlier Senate hearings, John Conyers, a senior Democrat on the House judiciary committee, said: \"We've already seen the creation of non-competitive markets in many cities ... I'm concerned that the United-US Airways merger could trigger a spate of other airline mergers.\" Such fears were exacerbated by takeover talks between American, Northwest, Delta and Continental after United announced its acquisition plans. British Airways, keen to do a deal with American, and KLM, which has an alliance with Northwest, also entered the takeover scene in June. The US and UK governments will be discussing transatlantic flights next month in London. United's unions scuppered the last attempt at a merger between the company and US Airways in 1995. In May this year, the Airline Pilots Association at United expressed its \"strong concerns\" about the current deal. Wall Street's arbitrage traders are already betting that the deal will not go ahead. Shares in US Airways were trading at about $37 yesterday, well below the $60 a share offered by United. United and US Airways remain confident that their deal with gain approval. Few analysts believe that any decision will be forthcoming before the Presidential elections, for political as well as corpporate reasons.",
