The Ravel is dangerous music, teetering on the edge of chaos.

But the sonata had come first, and so much of it had been incoherent - the opening Allegro, one of Schubert's rawest tragic statements, had such an unstable pulse the whole momentum of the movement was destroyed. The Andante went for nothing and the elements of the finale lacked any kind of integration. The result of all this was that the same shortcomings seemed magnified through the rest of his programme. </p> <p>The event was presented as the Yamaha Piano Centenary Concert, and the company had turned half of the QEH foyer into a showroom for the evening.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Against the background of Deckwrecka's lo-fi hip-hop set, 23 Skidoo sauntered on from stage left and began playing the distinctive trance-funk of The Gospel Comes to New Guinea. This unobtrusive entrance was typical of the band's performance. Unflashy and unpretentious, Alex Turnball (drums and percussion), Johnny Turnball (guitar), Fritz Catlin (drums and percussion) and Sketch Martin (bass) seemed overawed by their first gig in 16 years, and they came across as a little sedated. </p> <p>Rhythm has always been central to the 23 Skidoo sound. Twenty years ago, they applied their feral swathes of noise, loops and frenzied percussion to the US funk of James Brown and the Afrofunk of Fela Kuti. It was revolutionary then, but now it is as commonplace as a loaf of white bread. As the \"original punks on funks\" they have seen their legacy appropriated by jungle, drum'n'bass, techno and big beat and extended their reach to UK hip-hop with the Ronin label. </p> <p>Their old shows reputedly used to scare the hell out of their audience. But that has all changed. Older and wiser, 23 Skidoo have moved on, appearing laid-back, mellow elder statesmen. The show was divided on almost generational lines. On one side there was the old guard from the 1980s: Loose Ends' former singer, Carl McIntosh and the Aswad horn section. On the other, rappers Rodney P, Skitz and Roots Manuva took on the baton for the younger generation. </p> <p>For a band that make such beautiful music 23 Skidoo took great pains to present it in an offhand manner. It was as if they were admitting that their work was dull and mainstream. The fire has gone from their bellies. That said, the evening would have been an entirely different experience if the sound quality had not been so awful throughout. Things improved when a brass section arrived for the neo-tropical Crossfire. Dennis Rollins on trombone, Ray Carless on saxophone and Eddie Thornton on trumpet propelled the music onwards with fast, funky playing. Their sophistication allowed them to invade the rest of the music rather than play against it. </p> <p>The rappers fared worse. Skitz and Rodney P hit the stage running, but their requests for \"arms in the air\" went unheeded.

      "bodyText": "Against the background of Deckwrecka's lo-fi hip-hop set, 23 Skidoo sauntered on from stage left and began playing the distinctive trance-funk of The Gospel Comes to New Guinea. This unobtrusive entrance was typical of the band's performance. Unflashy and unpretentious, Alex Turnball (drums and percussion), Johnny Turnball (guitar), Fritz Catlin (drums and percussion) and Sketch Martin (bass) seemed overawed by their first gig in 16 years, and they came across as a little sedated. Rhythm has always been central to the 23 Skidoo sound. Twenty years ago, they applied their feral swathes of noise, loops and frenzied percussion to the US funk of James Brown and the Afrofunk of Fela Kuti. It was revolutionary then, but now it is as commonplace as a loaf of white bread. As the \"original punks on funks\" they have seen their legacy appropriated by jungle, drum'n'bass, techno and big beat and extended their reach to UK hip-hop with the Ronin label. Their old shows reputedly used to scare the hell out of their audience. But that has all changed. Older and wiser, 23 Skidoo have moved on, appearing laid-back, mellow elder statesmen. The show was divided on almost generational lines. On one side there was the old guard from the 1980s: Loose Ends' former singer, Carl McIntosh and the Aswad horn section. On the other, rappers Rodney P, Skitz and Roots Manuva took on the baton for the younger generation. For a band that make such beautiful music 23 Skidoo took great pains to present it in an offhand manner. It was as if they were admitting that their work was dull and mainstream. The fire has gone from their bellies. That said, the evening would have been an entirely different experience if the sound quality had not been so awful throughout. Things improved when a brass section arrived for the neo-tropical Crossfire. Dennis Rollins on trombone, Ray Carless on saxophone and Eddie Thornton on trumpet propelled the music onwards with fast, funky playing. Their sophistication allowed them to invade the rest of the music rather than play against it. The rappers fared worse. Skitz and Rodney P hit the stage running, but their requests for \"arms in the air\" went unheeded. To their credit, they did try to orchestrate their flow around the brass section and some ferocious drumming by Alex Turnball. 23 Skidoo's boisterous playing reached a manic peak on Where U At, the duet between Roots Manuva and Carl McIntosh. With McIntosh crooning the title, the eminently likeable Manuva showed why he is one of the best MCs in the UK. His display highlighted his verbal and rhythmic dexterity to devastating effect. The material that followed - IV, Apocalypse, Meltdown and Dusk to Dawn - operated in that grey area called \"the jam\".

Phrases of movement eddy from one dancer to another, connecting them like brightly articulate ripples of conversation. Yet all the while we are aware of the performers' individual personalities standing alone. One of Davies's greatest gifts is to make her dancers look extraordinarily themselves, and in this work she surpasses herself, containing within the brilliant logic of her choreo-graphy the wheeling energy of Matthew Morris, the distracted virtuosity of Henry Montes and the almost confrontational precision of Sarah Warsop. </p> <p>The work offers an unsentimental but profoundly affecting view of the ways in which we survive as social beings, and it is given a dark sense of mortality by David Buckland's staging.

These go along the lines of: \"How difficult is it to play yourself?\" (answer: \"What I find most difficult is to imitate my own accent\") and \"What are the politics in your show?\" (answer: \"Ah, I knew I'd forgotten to put something in. I had a checklist\"). It would be very easy for the piece to become merely irritating, but Martinez's (carefully contrived) persona is so engaging and she has so much theatrical trickery up her sleeve that it is impossible not to want the real Ursula Martinez to stand up for rather longer than just an hour.",

But Blunkett\u0092s initiative initially received a frosty reaction from many academics concerned that the two year vocational course would devalue the international reputation of the UK\u0092s traditional three year academic degree. It was thought that most older universities would spurn vocational training courses and stick to their core academic degrees. Yet while the majority of bids for the new courses involve former polytechnics, 17 of the 57 applications are led by old universities. Partnerships bidding for funds to develop foundation degrees must consist of : a higher education institution that will award the degree; employer representatives who will shape the course for their needs; and institutions that will deliver the course, usually further education colleges. About 2,000 students will be able to take up the new courses, offered by between 10 and 20 partnerships in 2001-02. The results of the competition are due to be announced in November.",

The move could potentially save millions of bank customers hundreds of pound a year, but it will also send reverberations around an industry where the main lenders are already locked in a vicious battle for custom. To date, products such as all-in-one accounts, which allow customers to offset interest earned on credit balances against the costs of debts such as a mortgage, have been restricted to internet banks and other small new entrants, such as Virgin One, which began as a joint venture with Royal Bank three years ago. These products work by eliminating the artificial barriers that keep current accounts, savings and borrowings, such as personal loans, credit cards and mortgages, separate. Following the completion of its acquisition of Woolwich next week, Barclays is expected to start targeting specific customers with Open Plan, Woolwich's version of an all-in-one account. City analysts expect Royal Bank of Scotland to replicate the experience it gained in devising Virgin One, one of the first of these types of accounts, through its own branches and those of NatWest, the clearing bank it bought earlier this year.

Recent research by analysts at investment bank Fox-Pitt, Kelton has highlighted the potential for a 9% fall in the profits of the leading clearing banks if they change their strategy on current accounts. Barclays said last night that once the \u00a35.5bn acquisition of Woolwich was completed it would \"target certain groups of customers, mainly those who have one product with us\", with Open Plan. This decision, however, might find the bank having to explain to its customers who might benefit most from the new account - those with more than one product - why they are not being targeted. Industry executives appear divided over just how much demand there is for such products which are likely to be attractive to only certain groups of customers. For instance mortgage products like the one which Royal Bank is thought to be planning might be most useful to people who receive large bonuses with which they could pay off their mortgages.

Bankers also suggest that particularly in the race for people with more than \u00a350,000 to invest, more sophisticated products are likely to emerge. One admitted last night that customer behaviour was also harder to judge than in the past which is why banks were likely to introduce more niche products. One bank which is aiming to take the all-in-one concept further than many others is Halifax's new telephone bank, Intelligent Finance.",

On the marble pavement outside, peasant migrants from the Chinese interior laboriously scrape away blobs of chewing gum and dirt by hand, using bare razor blades.</p> <p>Such contrasts are familiar in booming China today, but what is the real extent of rural poverty? In cold statistical terms, the problem is illustrated by two recent sets of figures released this month in Beijing. China recorded solid economic growth of 8.2 per cent year on year in the first nine months of 2000, said the State Statistical Bureau. The Bureau now expects the trend of slowing growth, visible since the early 1990s, to be reversed.</p> <p>The Chinese economy also got an encouraging boost at the beginning of October during the National Day holiday - extended to a week to encourage consumers to spend their savings in the shops. Nearly 60 million went travelling around the country and were reckoned to have spent about 23 billion Renminbi (\u00a31.9billion).</p> <p>From the Ministry of Agriculture came a different sort of statistic in its annual white paper. \"The price of farm produce (will) stay deplorably low this year, and township and village-run businesses, plagued by fund shortages and a feeble market demand, (cannot) play a robust role as they once did in absorbing surplus rural labour and increasing farmers' income,\" said the Ministry as summarised by the official China Daily.</p> <p>Other figures show a significant decline in product prices: wheat prices declined by more than 20 per cent between February 1999 and 2000. Egg prices declined by a staggering 35 per cent. It would be easy to infer from these disparities a classic \"contradiction\" between urban wealth and rural poverty, but this is an over-simplification.</p> <p>Rural incomes have grown impressively over the past 20 years and many country dwellers are much better off. Average net rural incomes per capita grew from 134 Renminbi (\u00a310) in 1978 to 2,090 in 1997.</p> <p>The very term \"peasant\" to describe the rural population has become anachronistic. \"1998 saw an extraordinary... watershed in the history of Chinese civilisation\", writes editor Nick Young in the development magazine Chinabrief. \"For the first time ever, less than half the working population was employed in agriculture (49.8 per cent), with the majority now divided between secondary (23.5 per cent) and tertiary, service industries (26.7 per cent).\"</p> <p>\"For better or for worse,\" concludes Mr Young in a thoughtful analysis, \"- and only the most conservative observer would see no liberating circumstances here - rural China is leaving its long history behind.\"</p> <p>The issue of rural poverty is more subtle and harder to pin down. One problem concerns how to define the phenomenon. The Chinese government estimates that only 34 million are now below its poverty line. The figure rises to 106 million if one applies to World Bank criterion of the number with an income of less than one US dollar (equivalent) a day. Even harder to define is the number of \"near poor\". There are uncounted millions whose current lives are already fairly miserable and who could quickly sink below the line if the economic climate changes for the worse.</p> <p>Whatever the claims of an \"economic miracle\", it seems very unlikely that poverty on a significant scale is about to be \"eliminated\" in China. \"The evidence appears to suggest\", says Chinabrief, \"that poverty is becoming 'deeper', if not more extensive. There are fewer absolute poor, but they are more absolutely poor than before.\"</p> <p>The trend is accentuated by the erosion of social welfare provision which has accompanied the Chinese economic reforms of the past two decades. With increased social mobility and a shift to smaller families, the traditional support of the extended family has also been weakened.</p> <p>All of this suggests a complex set of problems awaiting to be solved which require a more sophisticated approach, both by the Chinese government and by international donors. Other countries suffering from acute poverty may feel that they would be lucky to share China's plight, but for millions of ordinary Chinese it is none the less real. And an economic downturn - either domestically or if the world economy slumps and with it the demand for Chinese export-oriented labour - could plunge millions more back below the line.</p> <p>\u0095 Chinabrief, formerly China Development Briefing, is published quarterly in Hong Kong.

Average net rural incomes per capita grew from 134 Renminbi (\u00a310) in 1978 to 2,090 in 1997. The very term \"peasant\" to describe the rural population has become anachronistic. \"1998 saw an extraordinary... watershed in the history of Chinese civilisation\", writes editor Nick Young in the development magazine Chinabrief. \"For the first time ever, less than half the working population was employed in agriculture (49.8 per cent), with the majority now divided between secondary (23.5 per cent) and tertiary, service industries (26.7 per cent).\" \"For better or for worse,\" concludes Mr Young in a thoughtful analysis, \"- and only the most conservative observer would see no liberating circumstances here - rural China is leaving its long history behind.\" The issue of rural poverty is more subtle and harder to pin down. One problem concerns how to define the phenomenon. The Chinese government estimates that only 34 million are now below its poverty line. The figure rises to 106 million if one applies to World Bank criterion of the number with an income of less than one US dollar (equivalent) a day. Even harder to define is the number of \"near poor\". There are uncounted millions whose current lives are already fairly miserable and who could quickly sink below the line if the economic climate changes for the worse. Whatever the claims of an \"economic miracle\", it seems very unlikely that poverty on a significant scale is about to be \"eliminated\" in China. \"The evidence appears to suggest\", says Chinabrief, \"that poverty is becoming 'deeper', if not more extensive. There are fewer absolute poor, but they are more absolutely poor than before.\" The trend is accentuated by the erosion of social welfare provision which has accompanied the Chinese economic reforms of the past two decades. With increased social mobility and a shift to smaller families, the traditional support of the extended family has also been weakened. All of this suggests a complex set of problems awaiting to be solved which require a more sophisticated approach, both by the Chinese government and by international donors. Other countries suffering from acute poverty may feel that they would be lucky to share China's plight, but for millions of ordinary Chinese it is none the less real. And an economic downturn - either domestically or if the world economy slumps and with it the demand for Chinese export-oriented labour - could plunge millions more back below the line. \u0095 Chinabrief, formerly China Development Briefing, is published quarterly in Hong Kong.

      "bodyText": "The Railtrack chief executive, Gerald Corbett, is to keep his job as the company admitted today that a broken rail at the centre of the Hatfield train crash should have been replaced sooner. In a statement, the firm said the failure to replace the rail \"was Railtrack's responsibility\". The board unanimously rejected Mr Corbett's offer to resign, saying he was the best person to lead the inquiry into Tuesday's derailment, which claimed four lives. The company also said its preliminary view was that a broken rail caused the crash and that the condition of the rail was \"wholly unacceptable\". Railtrack also revealed it had identified as many as 100 track locations \"with similar characteristics to that at the stretch of track at Hatfield\". Mr Corbett offered to go yesterday, saying \"I, personally, am distraught that another tragedy has occurred on our railways\". However, the rail industry generally welcomed the board's decision, which was announced at 6am after a six-hour meeting, which ended around midnight. But former British Rail senior operations manager Peter Rayner dismissed the announcement as \"a good piece of public relations\" and asked why speed restrictions had not been in place at Hatfield. The board met after Railtrack disclosed that the Hatfield section of line has been assessed for re-railing in January this year, with work starting in May. The company added in a statement that whatever the cause of the crash was, the condition of the track was \"not good\". It went on: \"The condition of the rail, which was only five years' old, was wholly unacceptable. \"The probable cause of the fracture was gauge corner cracking. The rail was due to be replaced in November. The replacement should have been in place sooner and this was Railtrack's responsibility.\" Four people died and 35 were injured when the Great North Eastern Railways 12.10pm London to Leeds high-speed train was derailed on Tuesday.

Hence Rolex watches wouldn't be, well, Rolex watches if they didn't work rather well and look so fancy; Heinz Baked Beans wouldn't be Heinz if they didn't have a specially nice beany flavour and weren't consistently high quality. The same applies to Coca-Cola with its mystery ingredient, Rolls-Royce cars and any of the world's other leading power brands. </p> <p>A product also needs time and to be promoted and communicated consistently to become a brand.

Now that's given consumers a very clear understanding of what they are about,\" says Bean. </p> <p>But what really determines a brand is trust. This is why we consumers value them so highly and opt for known names and familiarly labelled goods over and above non-brands - because of the comfort element. They are, in effect, products with a \"trustmark\" rather than a mere \"trademark\". </p> <p>Dr Nick Georgiades, an industrial psychologist who has worked with BA and helped BT devise the memorable \"It's good to talk\" advertising campaign, says: \"If you see a brand as a trustmark it tells you that you have not been let down by it and that you can reduce anxiety by using it. Particularly today, in this crazy world of speed and noise and constant demands, we are all looking for a short-cut to anxiety reduction, so if you choose a trustmark you are reducing the possibility of new anxieties.\" </p> <p>Georgiades explains that trust is \"an historical concept\" and we need \"repeated interactions with associated good feelings\" to build it; indeed, branding experts suggest it takes at least three years to establish this feeling of goodwill among consumers. But we don't need to have directly experienced something ourselves. Our mums, say, might have always used Nivea face cream and now enjoy an impressively wrinkle-free old age, hence we might plump for Nivea as a result. </p> <p>Thus brands help us steer our way through the world. In a sea of consumer confusion, they are like a navigation point or a lighthouse, providing us with a sort of cultural map. </p> <p>But perhaps the most important role of all for brands, is that they help us define who we are. </p> <p>Peter York, the renowned style guru who runs his own brand consultancy SRU, says: \"Community, church or regiment don't work any more as prescribed identities, but people like to identify themselves so they make some chains of their own by choosing particular brands. They now brand themselves, with greater or lesser degrees of subtlety. They even say things like 'I'm not sure if this is right for my personal branding'.\" </p> <p>This \"personal branding\" might come in the shape of clothes and designer labels: by wearing Calvin Klein we are saying we are urban chic, for example, while Diesel suggests \"cool and edgy\". Similarly Country Casuals, Gap, and Dries van Noten all say quite different things about who we are or want to be. </p> <p>\"Cars and newspapers are particularly strong symbols or signals of what tribe we belong to and what we believe in - cars, whether they be sporty or functional or family, are a clear sign not least because most people know how much they cost so on a crude level they tell people how much money you've got,\" says Bean. </p> <p>Interestingly, the V&amp;A show includes a video installation of nine short films based around the stories of real people and their relationships with brands. One tells the tale of a taxi driver who has saved up for years to buy himself a Rolls-Royce; \"I haven't got any style but the Roller has,\" he explains. Another features a man who is very loyal to just two brands: Marks &amp; Spencer and Skoda. He proudly declares that he has had six Skodas in succession and that he buys all his clothes from M&amp;S, suggesting that this makes him a somehow better, even more interesting person than those who don't. </p> <p>Whatever happens next with brands probably depends on how deep manufacturers' pockets are.

The designer is the shaman of the 21st century - any bit that drops from him has a bit of magic about it.

These include a pullback of Israeli tanks from the edges of Palestinian towns, easing a ban on travel that is compounding an already battered Palestinian economy, and the re-arrest of dozens of militants set free during the fighting. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, said: \"\"Once the Israelis pull out their soldiers and tanks, once the Israelis stop firing, once the siege is lifted, I think this will help a great deal.\" Israeli authorities today lifted the internal closure on Palestinian areas, which allowed Palestinians to resume travel between towns inside the West Bank and Gaza. The Israelis opened border crossings to Egypt and Jordan, and goods again started to flow between Gaza and Israel. The Palestinians were allowed to reopen their airport in Gaza after a 10-day closure. However, Israel has yet to lift a closure between Israel and the Palestinian areas, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs, and the Palestinian economy from its principal sustenance. For their part, the Palestinians have begun to re-arrest some of the Islamic militants freed at the zenith of the recent violence. The Palestinian leadership also issued \"strict orders\" to observe the truce. Also, the two sides have held secret meetings between their security chiefs, chaired by the American CIA, aimed at restraining the Palestinian militias that have led the attacks on the Palestinian side. Four Israeli army outposts came under fire overnight in Gaza, but no soldiers were injured, the army said this morning. More than 100 people have died since the fighting began, the worst surge of violence since the two sides began regular peace negotiations in 1993. The Israeli security minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, speaking before today's clashes erupted, said that sporadic fighting was still a cause of concern. \"I don't see things calming down,\" he said on Israel Army radio. \"I personally see something more serious happening in the Palestinian Authority which raises a major question mark. Is Arafat in control?\"",

Here was a deeply serious, decidedly uncamp and certainly not musically-minded middle European Busby Berkeley, who made formal patterns on the screen with humans and horses in order to illustrate the betrayals of his country's history.

The drama is virtually divested of characters we can either sympathise with or hate. Instead, it deals largely in formal, abstract generalities. It is as if Jancso is merely watching, regretfully conscious that there are those who will be killed and those whose job it is to kill them. A man running on the horizon is calmly shot down.

      "body": "<p> Through the small tall bathroom window the December yard is gray and scratchy, the trees calligraphic. Exhaust from the dryer billows clumsily out from the house and up, breaking apart while tumbling into the white sky. </p> <p> The house is a factory. </p> <p> I put my pants back on and go back to my mother. I walk down the hall, past the laundry room, and into the family room. I close the door behind me, muffling the rumbling of the small shoes in the dryer, Toph's. </p> <p> \"Where were you?\" my mother says. </p> <p> \"In the bathroom,\" I say. </p> <p> \"Hmph,\" she says. </p> <p> \"What?\" </p> <p> \"For fifteen minutes?\" </p> <p> \"It wasn't that long.\" </p> <p> \"It was longer. Was something broken?\" </p> <p> \"No.\" </p> <p> \"Did you fall in?\" </p> <p> \"No.\" </p> <p> \"Were you playing with yourself?\" </p> <p> \"I was cutting my hair.\" </p> <p> \"You were contemplating your navel.\" </p> <p> \"Right. Whatever.\" </p> <p> \"Did you clean up?\" </p> <p> \"Yeah.\" </p> <p> I had not cleaned up, had actually left hair everywhere, twisted brown doodles drawn in the sink, but knew that my mother would not find out. She could not get up to check. </p> <p> My mother is on the couch. At this point, she does not move from the couch. There was a time, until a few months ago, when she was still up and about, walking and driving, running errands. </p> <p>After that there was a period when she spent most of her time in her chair, the one next to the couch, occasionally doing things, going out, whatnot. Finally she moved to the couch, but even then, for a while at least, while spending most of her time on the couch, every night at 11pm or so, she had made a point of making her way up the stairs, in her bare feet, still tanned brown in November, slow and careful on the green carpet, to my sister's old bedroom. She had been sleeping there for years-the room was pink, and clean, and the bed had a canopy, and long ago she resolved that she could no longer sleep with my father's coughing. </p> <p> But the last time she went upstairs was weeks ago. Now she is on the couch, not moving from the couch, reclining on the couch during the day and sleeping there at night, in her nightgown, with the TV on until dawn, a comforter over her, toe to neck. People know. </p> <p> While reclining on the couch most of the day and night, on her back, my mom turns her head to watch television and turns it back to spit up green fluid into a plastic receptacle. The plastic receptacle is new. For many weeks she had been spitting the green fluid into a towel, not the same towel, but a rotation of towels, one of which she would keep on her chest. But the towel on her chest, my sister Beth and I found after a short while, was not such a good place to spit the green fluid, because, as it turned out, the green fluid smelled awful, much more pungent an aroma than one might expect. (One expects some sort of odor, sure, but this.) And so the green fluid could not be left there, festering and then petrifying on the terry-cloth towels. (Because the green fluid hardened to a crust on the terry-cloth towels, they were almost impossible to clean. So the green-fluid towels were one-use only, and even if you used every corner of the towels, folding and turning, turning and folding, they would only last a few days each, and the supply was running short, even after we plundered the bathrooms, closets, the garage.) So finally Beth procured, and our mother began to spit the green fluid into, a small plastic container which looked makeshift, like a piece of an air-conditioning unit, but had been provided by the hospital and was as far as we knew designed for people who do a lot of spitting up of green fluid. It's a molded plastic receptacle, cream-colored, in the shape of a half-moon, which can be kept handy and spit into. It can be cupped around the mouth of a reclining person, just under the chin, in a way that allows the depositor of green bodily fluids to either raise one's head to spit directly into it, or to simply let the fluid dribble down, over his or her chin, and then into the receptacle waiting below. It was a great find, the half-moon plastic receptacle. </p> <p> \"That thing is handy, huh?\" I ask my mother, walking past her, toward the kitchen. </p> <p> \"Yeah, it's the cat's meow,\" she says. </p> <p> I get a popsicle from the refrigerator and come back to the family room. </p> <p> They took my mother's stomach out about six months ago. At that point, there wasn't a lot left to remove - they had already taken out [I would use the medical terms here if I knew them] the rest of it about a year before. Then they tied the [something] to the [something], hoped that they had removed the offending portion, and set her on a schedule of chemotherapy. But of course they didn't get it all. They had left some of it and it had grown, it had come back, it had laid eggs, was stowed away, was stuck to the side of the spaceship. She had seemed good for a while, had done the chemo, had gotten the wigs, and then her hair had grown back - darker, more brittle. But six months later she began to have pain again - Was it indigestion? It could just be indigestion, of course, the burping and the pain, the leaning over the kitchen table at dinner; people have indigestion; people take Tums; Hey Mom, should I get some Tums? - but when she went in again, and they had \"opened her up\" - a phrase they used - and had looked inside, it was staring out at them, at the doctors, like a thousand writhing worms under a rock, swarming, shimmering, wet and oily - Good God! - or maybe not like worms but like a million little podules, each a tiny city of cancer, each with an unruly, sprawling, environmentally careless citizenry with no zoning laws whatsoever. When the doctor opened her up, and there was suddenly light thrown upon the world of cancer - podules, they were annoyed by the disturbance, and defiant. Turn off. The fucking. Light. They glared at the doctor, each podule, though a city unto itself, having one single eye, one blind evil eye in the middle, which stared imperiously, as only a blind eye can do, out at the doctor. Go. The. Fuck. Away. The doctors did what they could, took the whole stomach out, connected what was left, this part to that, and sewed her back up, leaving the city as is, the colonists to their manifest destiny, their fossil fuels, their strip malls and suburban sprawl, and replaced the stomach with a tube and a portable external IV bag. It's kind of cute, the IV bag. She used to carry it with her, in a gray backpack - it's futuristic-looking, like a synthetic ice pack crossed with those liquid food pouches engineered for space travel. We have a name for it. We call it \"the bag.\" </p> <p> My mother and I are watching TV. It's the show where young amateur athletes with day jobs in marketing and engineering compete in sports of strength and agility against male and female bodybuilders. The bodybuilders are mostly blond and are impeccably tanned. They look great. They have names that sound fast and indomitable, names like American cars and electronics, like Firestar and Mercury and Zenith. It is a great show. </p> <p> \"What is this?\" she asks, leaning toward the TV. Her eyes, once small, sharp, intimidating, are now dull, yellow, droopy, strained - the spitting gives them a look of constant exasperation. </p> <p> \"The fighting show thing,\" I say. </p> <p> \"Hmm,\" she says, then turns, lifts her head to spit. </p> <p> \"Is it still bleeding?\" I ask, sucking on my popsicle. </p> <p> \"Yeah.\" </p> <p> We are having a nosebleed. While I was in the bathroom, she was holding the nose, but she can't hold it tight enough, so now I relieve her, pinching her nostrils with my free hand. Her skin is oily, smooth. </p> <p> \"Hold it tighter,\" she says. </p> <p> \"Okay,\" I say, and hold it tighter. Her skin is hot. </p> <p> Toph's shoes continue to rumble. </p> <p>A month ago Beth was awake early; she cannot remember why. She walked down the stairs, shushing the green carpet, down to the foyer's black slate floor. The front door was open, with only the screen door closed. It was fall, and cold, and so with two hands she closed the large wooden door, click, and turned toward the kitchen. She walked down the hall and into the kitchen, frost spiderwebbed on the corners of its sliding glass door, frost on the bare trees in the backyard. She opened the refrigerator and looked inside. Milk, fruit, IV bags dated for proper use. She closed the refrigerator. She walked from the kitchen into the family room, where the curtains surrounding the large front window were open, and the light outside was white. The window was a bright silver screen, lit from behind. She squinted until her eyes adjusted. As her eyes focused, in the middle of the screen, at the end of the driveway, was my father, kneeling. </p> <p>It's not that our family has no taste, it's just that our family's taste is inconsistent. The wallpaper in the downstairs bathroom, though it came with the house, is the house's most telling decorative statement, featuring a pattern of fifteen or so slogans and expressions popular at the time of its installation. Right On, Neat-O, Outta Sight! - arranged so they unite and abut in intriguing combinations. That-A-Way meets Way Out so that the A in That-A-Way creates A Way Out. The words are hand-rendered in stylized block letters, red and black against white. It could not be uglier, and yet the wallpaper is a novelty that visitors appreciate, evidence of a family with no pressing interest in addressing obvious problems of decor, and also proof of a happy time, an exuberant, fanciful time in American history that spawned exuberant and fanciful wallpaper. </p> <p> The living room is kind of classy, actually - clean, neat, full of heirlooms and antiques, an oriental rug covering the center of the hardwood floor. But the family room, the only room where any of us has ever spent any time, has always been, for better or for worse, the ultimate reflection of our true inclinations. It's always been jumbled, the furniture competing, with clenched teeth and sharp elbows, for the honor of the Most Wrong-looking Object. For twelve years, the dominant chairs were blood orange. The couch of our youth, that which interacted with the orange chairs and white shag carpet, was plaid-green, brown and white. The family room has always had the look of a ship's cabin, wood paneled, with six heavy wooden beams holding, or pretending to hold, the ceiling above. The family room is dark and, save for a general sort of decaying of its furniture and walls, has not changed much in the twenty years we've lived here. The furniture is overwhelmingly brown and squat, like the furniture of a family of bears. There is our latest couch, my father's, long and covered with something like tan-colored velour, and there is the chair next to the couch, which five years ago replaced the bloodoranges, a sofa-chair of brownish plaid, my mother's. In front of the couch is a coffee table made from a cross section of a tree, cut in such a way that the bark is still there, albeit heavily lacquered. We brought it back, many years ago, from California and it, like most of the house's furniture, is evidence of an empathetic sort of decorating philosophy - for aesthetically disenfranchised furnishings we are like the families that adopt troubled children and refugees from around the world-we see beauty within and cannot say no. </p> <p> One wall of the family room was and is dominated by a brick fireplace. The fireplace has a small recessed area that was built to facilitate indoor barbecuing, though we never put it to use, chiefly because when we moved in, we were told that raccoons lived somewhere high in the chimney. So for many years the recessed area sat dormant, until the day, about four years ago, that our father, possessed by the same odd sort of inspiration that had led him for many years to decorate the lamp next to the couch with rubber spiders and snakes, put a fish tank inside. The fish tank, its size chosen by a wild guess, ended up fitting perfectly. </p> <p> \"Hey hey!\" he had said when he installed it, sliding it right in, with no more than a centimeter of give on either side. \"Hey hey!\" was something he said, and to our ears it sounded a little too Fonzie, coming as it did from a gray-haired lawyer wearing madras pants. \"Hey hey!\" he would say after such miracles, which were dizzying in their quantity and wonderment - in addition to the Miracle of the Fish-tank Fitting, there was, for example, the Miracle of Getting the TV Wired Through the Stereo for True Stereo Sound, not to mention the Miracle of Running the Nintendo Wires Under the Wall-to-Wall Carpet So as Not to Have the Baby Tripping Over Them All the Time Goddammit. (He was addicted to Nintendo.) To bring attention to each marvel, he would stand before whoever happened to be in the room and, while grinning wildly, grip his hands together in triumph, over one shoulder and then the other, like the Cub Scout who won the Pinewood Derby. Sometimes, for modesty's sake, he would do it with his eyes closed and his head tilted. Did I do that? </p> <p> \"Loser,\" we would say. </p> <p> \"Aw, screw you,\" he would say, and go make himself a Bloody Mary. </p> <p> The ceiling in one corner of the living room is stained in concentric circles of yellow and brown, a souvenir from heavy rains the spring before. The door to the foyer hangs by one of its three hinges. The carpet, off-white wall-to-wall, is worn to its core and has not been vacuumed in months. The screen windows are still up-my father tried to take them down but could not this year. The family room's front window faces east, and because the house sits beneath a number of large elms, it receives little light. The light in the family room is not significantly different in the day and the night. The family room is usually dark. </p> <p>I am home from college for Christmas break. Our older brother, Bill, just went back to DC, where he works for the Heritage Foundation-something to do with eastern European economics, privatization, conversion. My sister is home because she has been home all year - she deferred law school to be here for the fun. When I come home, Beth goes out. </p> <p> \"Where are you going?\" I usually say. </p> <p> \"Out,\" she usually says. </p> <p> I am holding the nose. As the nose bleeds and we try to stop it, we watch TV. On the TV an accountant from Denver is trying to climb up a wall before a bodybuilder named Striker catches him and pulls him off the wall. The other segments of the show can be tense - there is an obstacle course segment, where the contestants are racing against each other and also the clock, and another segment where they hit each other with sponge-ended paddles, both of which can be extremely exciting, especially if the contest is a close one, evenly matched and with much at stake - but this part, with the wall climbing, is too disturbing. The idea of the accountant being chased while climbing a wall... no one wants to be chased while climbing a wall, chased by anything, by people, hands grabbing at their ankles as they reach for the bell at the top. Striker wants to grab and pull the accountant down - he lunges every so often at the accountant's legs - all he needs is a good grip, a lunge and a grip and a good yank-and if Striker and his hands do that before the accountant gets to ring the bell... it's a horrible part of the show. The accountant climbs quickly, feverishly, nailing foothold after foothold, and for a second it looks like he'll make it, because Striker is so far below, two people-lengths easily, but then the accountant pauses. He cannot see his next move. The next grip is too far to reach from where he is. So then he actually backs up, goes down a notch to set out on a different path and when he steps down it is unbearable, the suspense. The accountant steps down and then starts up the left side of the wall, but suddenly Striker is there, out of nowhere - he wasn't even in the screen! - and he has the accountant's leg, at the calf, and he yanks and it's over. The accountant flies from the wall (attached by rope of course) and descends slowly to the floor. It's terrible. I won't watch this show again. </p> <p> Mom prefers the show where three young women sit on a pastel-colored couch and recount blind dates that they have all enjoyed or suffered through with the same man. For months, Beth and Mom have watched the show, every night. Sometimes the show's participants have had sex with one another, but use funny words to describe it. And there is the funny host with the big nose and the black curly hair. He is a funny man, and has fun with the show, keeps everything buoyant. At the end the show, the bachelor picks one of the three with whom he wants to go on another date. The host then does something pretty incredible: even though he's already paid for the three dates previously described, and even though he has nothing to gain from doing anything more, he still gives the bachelor and bachelorette money for their next date. </p> <p> Mom watches it every night; it's the only thing she can watch without falling asleep, which she does a lot, dozing on and off during the day. But she does not sleep at night. </p> <p> \"Of course you sleep at night,\" I say. </p> <p> \"I don't,\" she says. </p> <p> \"Everyone sleeps at night,\" I say - this is an issue with me - \"even if it doesn't feel like it. The night is way, way too long to stay awake the whole way through. I mean, there have been times when I was pretty sure I had stayed up all night, like when I was sure the vampires from Salem's Lot - do you remember that one, with David Soul and everything? With the people impaled on the antlers? I was afraid to sleep, so I would stay up all night, watching that little portable TV on my stomach, the whole night, afraid to drift off, because I was sure they'd be waiting for just that moment, just when I fell asleep, to come and float up to my window, or down the hall, and bite me, all slow-like ...\" </p> <p> She spits into her half-moon and looks at me. </p> <p> \"What the hell are you talking about?\" </p> <p>In the fireplace, the fish tank is still there, but the fish, four or five of those bug-eyed goldfish with elephantiasis, died weeks ago. The water, still lit from above by the purplish aquarium light, is gray with mold and fish feces, hazy like a shaken snow globe. I am wondering about something. I am wondering what the water would taste like. Like a nutritional shake? Like sewage? I think of asking my mother: What do you think that would taste like? But she will not find the question amusing. She will not answer. </p> <p> \"Would you check it?\" she says, referring to her nose. </p> <p> I let go of her nostrils. Nothing. </p> <p> I watch the nose. She is still tan from the summer. Her skin is smooth, brown. </p> <p> Then it comes, the blood, first in a tiny rivulet, followed by a thick eel, venturing out, slowly. I get a towel and dab it away. </p> <p> \"It's still coming,\" I say. </p> <p> Her white blood cell count has been low. Her blood cannot clot properly, the doctor had said the last time this had happened, so, he said, we can have no bleeding. Any bleeding could be the end, he said. Yes, we said. We were not worried. There seemed to be precious few opportunities to draw blood, with her living, as she did, on the couch. I'll keep sharp objects out of proximity, I had joked to the doctor. The doctor did not chuckle. I wondered if he had heard me. I considered repeating it, but then figured that he had probably heard me but had not found it funny. But maybe he didn't hear me. I thought briefly, then, about supplementing the joke somehow, pushing it over the top, so to speak, with the second joke bringing the first one up and creating a sort of one-two punch. No more knife fights, I might say. No more knife throwing, I might say, heh heh. But this doctor does not joke much. Some of the nurses do. It is our job to joke with the doctors and nurses. It is our job to listen to the doctors, and after listening to the doctors, Beth usually asks the doctors specific questions - How often will she have to take that? Can't we just add that to the mix in the IV? - and then we sometimes add some levity with a witty aside. From books and television I know to do this. One should joke in the face of adversity; there is always humor, we are told. But in the last few weeks, we haven't found much. We have been looking for funny things, but have found very little. </p> <p> \"I can't get the game to work,\" says Toph, who has appeared from the basement. Christmas was a week ago, and we got him a bunch of new games for the Sega. </p> <p> \"What?\" </p> <p> \"I can't get the game to work.\" </p> <p> \"Is it turned on?\" </p> <p> \"Yes.\" </p> <p> \"Is the cartridge plugged all the way in?\" </p> <p> \"Yes.\" </p> <p> \"Turn it off and on again.\" </p> <p> \"Okay,\" he says, and goes back downstairs. </p> <p>*** </p> <p>Through the family room window, in the middle of the white-silver screen, my father was in his suit, a gray suit, dressed for work. Beth paused in the entrance between the kitchen and the family room and watched. The trees in the yard across the street were huge, gray-trunked, high-limbed, the short grass on the lawn yellowed, spotted with fall leaves. He did not move. His suit, even with him kneeling, leaning forward, was loose on his shoulders and back. He had lost so much weight. A car went by, a gray blur. She waited for him to get up. </p> <p>You should see the area where her stomach was. It's grown like a pumpkin. Round, bloated. It's odd - they removed the stomach, and some of the surrounding area if I remember correctly, but even with the removal of so much thereabouts, she looks pregnant. You can see it, the bulge, even under the blanket. I'm assuming it's the cancer, but I haven't asked my mother, or Beth. Was it the bloating of the starving child? I don't know. I don't ask questions. Before, when I said that I asked questions, I lied. </p> <p> The nose has at this point been bleeding for about ten minutes. She had had one nosebleed before, two weeks ago maybe, and Beth could not make it stop, so she and Beth had gone to the emergency room. The hospital people had kept her for two days. Her oncologist, who sometimes we liked and sometimes we did not, came and visited and glanced at stainless steel charts and chatted on the side of the bed-he has been her oncologist for many years. They gave her new blood and had monitored her white blood cell count. They had wanted to keep her longer, but she had insisted on going home; she was terrified of being in there, was finished with hospitals. </p> <p> She had come out feeling defeated, stripped, and now, safely at home, she did not want to go back. She had made me and Beth promise that she would never have to go back. We had promised. </p> <p> \"Okay,\" we said. </p> <p> \"I'm serious,\" she said. </p> <p> \"Okay,\" we said. </p> <p> I push her forehead as far back as possible. The arm of the couch is soft and pliable. </p> <p> She spits. She is used to the spitting, but still makes strained, soft vomiting noises. </p> <p> \"Does it hurt?\" I ask. </p> <p> \"Does what hurt?\" </p> <p> \"The spitting.\" </p> <p> \"No, it feels good, stupid.\" </p> <p> \"Sorry.\" </p> <p> A family walks by outside, two parents, a small child in snow-pants and a parka, a stroller. They do not look through our window. It is hard to tell if they know. They might know but are being polite. People know. </p> <p> My mother likes to have the curtains open so she can see the yard and the street. During the day it is often very bright outside, and though the brightness is visible from inside the family room, somehow the light does not travel effectively into the family room, in terms of bringing to the family room any noticeable illumination. I am not a proponent of the curtains being open. </p> <p> Some people know. Of course they know. </p> <p> People know. </p> <p> Everyone knows. </p> <p> Everyone is talking. Waiting. </p> <p> I have plans for them, the nosy, the inquisitive, the pitying, have developed elaborate fantasies for those who would see us as grotesque, pathetic, our situation gossip fodder. I picture strangulations-Tsk tsk, I hear she's - GURGLE! - neck-breakings - what will happen to that poor little bo-CRACK! - I picture kicking bodies as they lie curled on the ground, spitting blood as they - Jesus Christ, Jesus fucking Christ, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - beg for mercy. I lift them over my head and then bring them down, break them over my knee, their spines like dowels of balsa. Can't you see it? I push offenders into giant vats of acid and watch them struggle, scream as the acid burns, breaks them apart. My hands fly into them, breaking their skin - I pull out hearts and intestines and toss them aside. I do head-crushings, beheadings, some work with baseball bats-the variety and degree of punishment depending on the offender and the offense. Those whom I don't like or my mother doesn't like in the first place get the worst - usually long, drawn-out strangulations, faces of red then purple then mauve. Those I barely know, like the family that just walked by, are spared the worst-nothing personal. I'll run them over with my car. </p> <p> We are both distantly worried about the bleeding nose, my mother and I, but are for the time being working under the assumption that the nose will stop bleeding. While I hold her nose she holds the half-moon receptacle as it rests on the upper portion of her chest, under her chin. </p> <p> Just then I have a great idea. I try to get her to talk funny, the way people talk when their nose is being held. </p> <p> \"Please?\" I say. </p> <p> \"No,\" she says. </p> <p> \"C'mon.\" </p> <p> \"Cut it out.\" </p> <p> \"What?\" </p> <p>My mother's hands are veiny and strong. Her neck has veins. Her back has freckles. She used to do a trick where it looked like she would be pulling off her thumb, when in fact she was not. Do you know this trick? Part of one's right thumb is made to look like part of one's left hand, and then is slid up and down the index finger of the left finger-attached, then detached. It's an unsettling trick, and more so when my mother used to do it, because she did it in a way where her hands sort of shook, vibrated, her neck's veins protruding and taut, her face gripped with the strain plausibly attendant to pulling off one's finger. As children, we watched with both glee and terror. We knew it was not real, we had seen it dozens of times, but its power was never diminished, because my mother's was a uniquely physical presence - she was all skin and muscles. We would make her do the trick for our friends, who were also horrified and enthralled. But kids loved her. Everyone knew her from school - she directed the plays in grade school, would take in kids who were going through divorces, knew and loved and was not shy about hugging any of them, especially the shy ones - there was an effortless kind of understanding, an utter lack of doubt about what she was doing that put people at ease, so unlike some of the mothers, so brittle and unsure. Of course, if she didn't like someone, that kid knew it. Like Dean Baldwin, the beefy, dirty-blond boy up the block, who would stand in the street and, unprovoked, give her the finger as she drove by. \"Bad kid,\" she would say, and she meant it - she had an inner hardness that under no circumstances did you want to trifle with - and would have him struck from her list until the second he might say sorry (Dean unfortunately did not), at which time he would have gotten a hug like anyone else. </p> <p>As strong as she was physically, most of the power was in her eyes, small and blue, and when she squinted, she would squint with a murderous intensity that meant, unmistakably, that, if pushed, she would deliver on her stare's implied threat, that to protect what she cared about, she would not stop, that she would run right over you. But she wore her strength casually, had a trusting carelessness with her flesh and muscles. She would cut herself while slicing vegetables, cut the living shit out of her finger, usually her thumb, and it would bleed everywhere, on the tomatoes, the cutting board, in the sink, while we watched at her waist, awed, scared she would die. But she would just grimace, wash the thumb clean under the tap, wrap the thumb in a paper towel and keep cutting, while the blood slowly soaked through the paper towel, crawling, as blood crawls, outward from the wound's wet center. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Through the small tall bathroom window the December yard is gray and scratchy, the trees calligraphic. Exhaust from the dryer billows clumsily out from the house and up, breaking apart while tumbling into the white sky. The house is a factory. I put my pants back on and go back to my mother. I walk down the hall, past the laundry room, and into the family room. I close the door behind me, muffling the rumbling of the small shoes in the dryer, Toph's. \"Where were you?\" my mother says. \"In the bathroom,\" I say. \"Hmph,\" she says. \"What?\" \"For fifteen minutes?\" \"It wasn't that long.\" \"It was longer. Was something broken?\" \"No.\" \"Did you fall in?\" \"No.\" \"Were you playing with yourself?\" \"I was cutting my hair.\" \"You were contemplating your navel.\" \"Right. Whatever.\" \"Did you clean up?\" \"Yeah.\" I had not cleaned up, had actually left hair everywhere, twisted brown doodles drawn in the sink, but knew that my mother would not find out. She could not get up to check. My mother is on the couch. At this point, she does not move from the couch. There was a time, until a few months ago, when she was still up and about, walking and driving, running errands. After that there was a period when she spent most of her time in her chair, the one next to the couch, occasionally doing things, going out, whatnot. Finally she moved to the couch, but even then, for a while at least, while spending most of her time on the couch, every night at 11pm or so, she had made a point of making her way up the stairs, in her bare feet, still tanned brown in November, slow and careful on the green carpet, to my sister's old bedroom. She had been sleeping there for years-the room was pink, and clean, and the bed had a canopy, and long ago she resolved that she could no longer sleep with my father's coughing. But the last time she went upstairs was weeks ago. Now she is on the couch, not moving from the couch, reclining on the couch during the day and sleeping there at night, in her nightgown, with the TV on until dawn, a comforter over her, toe to neck. People know. While reclining on the couch most of the day and night, on her back, my mom turns her head to watch television and turns it back to spit up green fluid into a plastic receptacle. The plastic receptacle is new. For many weeks she had been spitting the green fluid into a towel, not the same towel, but a rotation of towels, one of which she would keep on her chest. But the towel on her chest, my sister Beth and I found after a short while, was not such a good place to spit the green fluid, because, as it turned out, the green fluid smelled awful, much more pungent an aroma than one might expect. (One expects some sort of odor, sure, but this.) And so the green fluid could not be left there, festering and then petrifying on the terry-cloth towels. (Because the green fluid hardened to a crust on the terry-cloth towels, they were almost impossible to clean. So the green-fluid towels were one-use only, and even if you used every corner of the towels, folding and turning, turning and folding, they would only last a few days each, and the supply was running short, even after we plundered the bathrooms, closets, the garage.) So finally Beth procured, and our mother began to spit the green fluid into, a small plastic container which looked makeshift, like a piece of an air-conditioning unit, but had been provided by the hospital and was as far as we knew designed for people who do a lot of spitting up of green fluid. It's a molded plastic receptacle, cream-colored, in the shape of a half-moon, which can be kept handy and spit into. It can be cupped around the mouth of a reclining person, just under the chin, in a way that allows the depositor of green bodily fluids to either raise one's head to spit directly into it, or to simply let the fluid dribble down, over his or her chin, and then into the receptacle waiting below. It was a great find, the half-moon plastic receptacle. \"That thing is handy, huh?\" I ask my mother, walking past her, toward the kitchen. \"Yeah, it's the cat's meow,\" she says. I get a popsicle from the refrigerator and come back to the family room. They took my mother's stomach out about six months ago. At that point, there wasn't a lot left to remove - they had already taken out [I would use the medical terms here if I knew them] the rest of it about a year before. Then they tied the [something] to the [something], hoped that they had removed the offending portion, and set her on a schedule of chemotherapy. But of course they didn't get it all. They had left some of it and it had grown, it had come back, it had laid eggs, was stowed away, was stuck to the side of the spaceship. She had seemed good for a while, had done the chemo, had gotten the wigs, and then her hair had grown back - darker, more brittle. But six months later she began to have pain again - Was it indigestion? It could just be indigestion, of course, the burping and the pain, the leaning over the kitchen table at dinner; people have indigestion; people take Tums; Hey Mom, should I get some Tums? - but when she went in again, and they had \"opened her up\" - a phrase they used - and had looked inside, it was staring out at them, at the doctors, like a thousand writhing worms under a rock, swarming, shimmering, wet and oily - Good God! - or maybe not like worms but like a million little podules, each a tiny city of cancer, each with an unruly, sprawling, environmentally careless citizenry with no zoning laws whatsoever. When the doctor opened her up, and there was suddenly light thrown upon the world of cancer - podules, they were annoyed by the disturbance, and defiant. Turn off. The fucking. Light. They glared at the doctor, each podule, though a city unto itself, having one single eye, one blind evil eye in the middle, which stared imperiously, as only a blind eye can do, out at the doctor. Go. The. Fuck. Away. The doctors did what they could, took the whole stomach out, connected what was left, this part to that, and sewed her back up, leaving the city as is, the colonists to their manifest destiny, their fossil fuels, their strip malls and suburban sprawl, and replaced the stomach with a tube and a portable external IV bag. It's kind of cute, the IV bag. She used to carry it with her, in a gray backpack - it's futuristic-looking, like a synthetic ice pack crossed with those liquid food pouches engineered for space travel. We have a name for it. We call it \"the bag.\" My mother and I are watching TV. It's the show where young amateur athletes with day jobs in marketing and engineering compete in sports of strength and agility against male and female bodybuilders. The bodybuilders are mostly blond and are impeccably tanned. They look great. They have names that sound fast and indomitable, names like American cars and electronics, like Firestar and Mercury and Zenith. It is a great show. \"What is this?\" she asks, leaning toward the TV. Her eyes, once small, sharp, intimidating, are now dull, yellow, droopy, strained - the spitting gives them a look of constant exasperation. \"The fighting show thing,\" I say. \"Hmm,\" she says, then turns, lifts her head to spit. \"Is it still bleeding?\" I ask, sucking on my popsicle. \"Yeah.\" We are having a nosebleed. While I was in the bathroom, she was holding the nose, but she can't hold it tight enough, so now I relieve her, pinching her nostrils with my free hand. Her skin is oily, smooth. \"Hold it tighter,\" she says. \"Okay,\" I say, and hold it tighter. Her skin is hot. Toph's shoes continue to rumble. A month ago Beth was awake early; she cannot remember why. She walked down the stairs, shushing the green carpet, down to the foyer's black slate floor. The front door was open, with only the screen door closed. It was fall, and cold, and so with two hands she closed the large wooden door, click, and turned toward the kitchen. She walked down the hall and into the kitchen, frost spiderwebbed on the corners of its sliding glass door, frost on the bare trees in the backyard. She opened the refrigerator and looked inside. Milk, fruit, IV bags dated for proper use. She closed the refrigerator. She walked from the kitchen into the family room, where the curtains surrounding the large front window were open, and the light outside was white. The window was a bright silver screen, lit from behind. She squinted until her eyes adjusted. As her eyes focused, in the middle of the screen, at the end of the driveway, was my father, kneeling. It's not that our family has no taste, it's just that our family's taste is inconsistent. The wallpaper in the downstairs bathroom, though it came with the house, is the house's most telling decorative statement, featuring a pattern of fifteen or so slogans and expressions popular at the time of its installation. Right On, Neat-O, Outta Sight! - arranged so they unite and abut in intriguing combinations. That-A-Way meets Way Out so that the A in That-A-Way creates A Way Out. The words are hand-rendered in stylized block letters, red and black against white. It could not be uglier, and yet the wallpaper is a novelty that visitors appreciate, evidence of a family with no pressing interest in addressing obvious problems of decor, and also proof of a happy time, an exuberant, fanciful time in American history that spawned exuberant and fanciful wallpaper. The living room is kind of classy, actually - clean, neat, full of heirlooms and antiques, an oriental rug covering the center of the hardwood floor. But the family room, the only room where any of us has ever spent any time, has always been, for better or for worse, the ultimate reflection of our true inclinations. It's always been jumbled, the furniture competing, with clenched teeth and sharp elbows, for the honor of the Most Wrong-looking Object. For twelve years, the dominant chairs were blood orange. The couch of our youth, that which interacted with the orange chairs and white shag carpet, was plaid-green, brown and white. The family room has always had the look of a ship's cabin, wood paneled, with six heavy wooden beams holding, or pretending to hold, the ceiling above. The family room is dark and, save for a general sort of decaying of its furniture and walls, has not changed much in the twenty years we've lived here. The furniture is overwhelmingly brown and squat, like the furniture of a family of bears. There is our latest couch, my father's, long and covered with something like tan-colored velour, and there is the chair next to the couch, which five years ago replaced the bloodoranges, a sofa-chair of brownish plaid, my mother's. In front of the couch is a coffee table made from a cross section of a tree, cut in such a way that the bark is still there, albeit heavily lacquered. We brought it back, many years ago, from California and it, like most of the house's furniture, is evidence of an empathetic sort of decorating philosophy - for aesthetically disenfranchised furnishings we are like the families that adopt troubled children and refugees from around the world-we see beauty within and cannot say no. One wall of the family room was and is dominated by a brick fireplace. The fireplace has a small recessed area that was built to facilitate indoor barbecuing, though we never put it to use, chiefly because when we moved in, we were told that raccoons lived somewhere high in the chimney. So for many years the recessed area sat dormant, until the day, about four years ago, that our father, possessed by the same odd sort of inspiration that had led him for many years to decorate the lamp next to the couch with rubber spiders and snakes, put a fish tank inside. The fish tank, its size chosen by a wild guess, ended up fitting perfectly. \"Hey hey!\" he had said when he installed it, sliding it right in, with no more than a centimeter of give on either side. \"Hey hey!\" was something he said, and to our ears it sounded a little too Fonzie, coming as it did from a gray-haired lawyer wearing madras pants. \"Hey hey!\" he would say after such miracles, which were dizzying in their quantity and wonderment - in addition to the Miracle of the Fish-tank Fitting, there was, for example, the Miracle of Getting the TV Wired Through the Stereo for True Stereo Sound, not to mention the Miracle of Running the Nintendo Wires Under the Wall-to-Wall Carpet So as Not to Have the Baby Tripping Over Them All the Time Goddammit. (He was addicted to Nintendo.) To bring attention to each marvel, he would stand before whoever happened to be in the room and, while grinning wildly, grip his hands together in triumph, over one shoulder and then the other, like the Cub Scout who won the Pinewood Derby. Sometimes, for modesty's sake, he would do it with his eyes closed and his head tilted. Did I do that? \"Loser,\" we would say. \"Aw, screw you,\" he would say, and go make himself a Bloody Mary. The ceiling in one corner of the living room is stained in concentric circles of yellow and brown, a souvenir from heavy rains the spring before. The door to the foyer hangs by one of its three hinges. The carpet, off-white wall-to-wall, is worn to its core and has not been vacuumed in months. The screen windows are still up-my father tried to take them down but could not this year. The family room's front window faces east, and because the house sits beneath a number of large elms, it receives little light. The light in the family room is not significantly different in the day and the night. The family room is usually dark. I am home from college for Christmas break. Our older brother, Bill, just went back to DC, where he works for the Heritage Foundation-something to do with eastern European economics, privatization, conversion. My sister is home because she has been home all year - she deferred law school to be here for the fun. When I come home, Beth goes out. \"Where are you going?\" I usually say. \"Out,\" she usually says. I am holding the nose. As the nose bleeds and we try to stop it, we watch TV. On the TV an accountant from Denver is trying to climb up a wall before a bodybuilder named Striker catches him and pulls him off the wall. The other segments of the show can be tense - there is an obstacle course segment, where the contestants are racing against each other and also the clock, and another segment where they hit each other with sponge-ended paddles, both of which can be extremely exciting, especially if the contest is a close one, evenly matched and with much at stake - but this part, with the wall climbing, is too disturbing. The idea of the accountant being chased while climbing a wall... no one wants to be chased while climbing a wall, chased by anything, by people, hands grabbing at their ankles as they reach for the bell at the top. Striker wants to grab and pull the accountant down - he lunges every so often at the accountant's legs - all he needs is a good grip, a lunge and a grip and a good yank-and if Striker and his hands do that before the accountant gets to ring the bell... it's a horrible part of the show. The accountant climbs quickly, feverishly, nailing foothold after foothold, and for a second it looks like he'll make it, because Striker is so far below, two people-lengths easily, but then the accountant pauses. He cannot see his next move. The next grip is too far to reach from where he is. So then he actually backs up, goes down a notch to set out on a different path and when he steps down it is unbearable, the suspense. The accountant steps down and then starts up the left side of the wall, but suddenly Striker is there, out of nowhere - he wasn't even in the screen! - and he has the accountant's leg, at the calf, and he yanks and it's over. The accountant flies from the wall (attached by rope of course) and descends slowly to the floor. It's terrible. I won't watch this show again. Mom prefers the show where three young women sit on a pastel-colored couch and recount blind dates that they have all enjoyed or suffered through with the same man. For months, Beth and Mom have watched the show, every night. Sometimes the show's participants have had sex with one another, but use funny words to describe it. And there is the funny host with the big nose and the black curly hair. He is a funny man, and has fun with the show, keeps everything buoyant. At the end the show, the bachelor picks one of the three with whom he wants to go on another date. The host then does something pretty incredible: even though he's already paid for the three dates previously described, and even though he has nothing to gain from doing anything more, he still gives the bachelor and bachelorette money for their next date. Mom watches it every night; it's the only thing she can watch without falling asleep, which she does a lot, dozing on and off during the day. But she does not sleep at night. \"Of course you sleep at night,\" I say. \"I don't,\" she says. \"Everyone sleeps at night,\" I say - this is an issue with me - \"even if it doesn't feel like it. The night is way, way too long to stay awake the whole way through. I mean, there have been times when I was pretty sure I had stayed up all night, like when I was sure the vampires from Salem's Lot - do you remember that one, with David Soul and everything? With the people impaled on the antlers? I was afraid to sleep, so I would stay up all night, watching that little portable TV on my stomach, the whole night, afraid to drift off, because I was sure they'd be waiting for just that moment, just when I fell asleep, to come and float up to my window, or down the hall, and bite me, all slow-like ...\" She spits into her half-moon and looks at me. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" In the fireplace, the fish tank is still there, but the fish, four or five of those bug-eyed goldfish with elephantiasis, died weeks ago. The water, still lit from above by the purplish aquarium light, is gray with mold and fish feces, hazy like a shaken snow globe. I am wondering about something. I am wondering what the water would taste like. Like a nutritional shake? Like sewage? I think of asking my mother: What do you think that would taste like? But she will not find the question amusing. She will not answer. \"Would you check it?\" she says, referring to her nose. I let go of her nostrils. Nothing. I watch the nose. She is still tan from the summer. Her skin is smooth, brown. Then it comes, the blood, first in a tiny rivulet, followed by a thick eel, venturing out, slowly. I get a towel and dab it away. \"It's still coming,\" I say. Her white blood cell count has been low. Her blood cannot clot properly, the doctor had said the last time this had happened, so, he said, we can have no bleeding. Any bleeding could be the end, he said. Yes, we said. We were not worried. There seemed to be precious few opportunities to draw blood, with her living, as she did, on the couch. I'll keep sharp objects out of proximity, I had joked to the doctor. The doctor did not chuckle. I wondered if he had heard me. I considered repeating it, but then figured that he had probably heard me but had not found it funny. But maybe he didn't hear me. I thought briefly, then, about supplementing the joke somehow, pushing it over the top, so to speak, with the second joke bringing the first one up and creating a sort of one-two punch. No more knife fights, I might say. No more knife throwing, I might say, heh heh. But this doctor does not joke much. Some of the nurses do. It is our job to joke with the doctors and nurses. It is our job to listen to the doctors, and after listening to the doctors, Beth usually asks the doctors specific questions - How often will she have to take that? Can't we just add that to the mix in the IV? - and then we sometimes add some levity with a witty aside. From books and television I know to do this. One should joke in the face of adversity; there is always humor, we are told. But in the last few weeks, we haven't found much. We have been looking for funny things, but have found very little. \"I can't get the game to work,\" says Toph, who has appeared from the basement. Christmas was a week ago, and we got him a bunch of new games for the Sega. \"What?\" \"I can't get the game to work.\" \"Is it turned on?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is the cartridge plugged all the way in?\" \"Yes.\" \"Turn it off and on again.\" \"Okay,\" he says, and goes back downstairs. *** Through the family room window, in the middle of the white-silver screen, my father was in his suit, a gray suit, dressed for work. Beth paused in the entrance between the kitchen and the family room and watched. The trees in the yard across the street were huge, gray-trunked, high-limbed, the short grass on the lawn yellowed, spotted with fall leaves. He did not move. His suit, even with him kneeling, leaning forward, was loose on his shoulders and back. He had lost so much weight. A car went by, a gray blur. She waited for him to get up. You should see the area where her stomach was. It's grown like a pumpkin. Round, bloated. It's odd - they removed the stomach, and some of the surrounding area if I remember correctly, but even with the removal of so much thereabouts, she looks pregnant. You can see it, the bulge, even under the blanket. I'm assuming it's the cancer, but I haven't asked my mother, or Beth. Was it the bloating of the starving child? I don't know. I don't ask questions. Before, when I said that I asked questions, I lied. The nose has at this point been bleeding for about ten minutes. She had had one nosebleed before, two weeks ago maybe, and Beth could not make it stop, so she and Beth had gone to the emergency room. The hospital people had kept her for two days. Her oncologist, who sometimes we liked and sometimes we did not, came and visited and glanced at stainless steel charts and chatted on the side of the bed-he has been her oncologist for many years. They gave her new blood and had monitored her white blood cell count. They had wanted to keep her longer, but she had insisted on going home; she was terrified of being in there, was finished with hospitals. She had come out feeling defeated, stripped, and now, safely at home, she did not want to go back. She had made me and Beth promise that she would never have to go back. We had promised. \"Okay,\" we said. \"I'm serious,\" she said. \"Okay,\" we said. I push her forehead as far back as possible. The arm of the couch is soft and pliable. She spits. She is used to the spitting, but still makes strained, soft vomiting noises. \"Does it hurt?\" I ask. \"Does what hurt?\" \"The spitting.\" \"No, it feels good, stupid.\" \"Sorry.\" A family walks by outside, two parents, a small child in snow-pants and a parka, a stroller. They do not look through our window. It is hard to tell if they know. They might know but are being polite. People know. My mother likes to have the curtains open so she can see the yard and the street. During the day it is often very bright outside, and though the brightness is visible from inside the family room, somehow the light does not travel effectively into the family room, in terms of bringing to the family room any noticeable illumination. I am not a proponent of the curtains being open. Some people know. Of course they know. People know. Everyone knows. Everyone is talking. Waiting. I have plans for them, the nosy, the inquisitive, the pitying, have developed elaborate fantasies for those who would see us as grotesque, pathetic, our situation gossip fodder. I picture strangulations-Tsk tsk, I hear she's - GURGLE! - neck-breakings - what will happen to that poor little bo-CRACK! - I picture kicking bodies as they lie curled on the ground, spitting blood as they - Jesus Christ, Jesus fucking Christ, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! - beg for mercy. I lift them over my head and then bring them down, break them over my knee, their spines like dowels of balsa. Can't you see it? I push offenders into giant vats of acid and watch them struggle, scream as the acid burns, breaks them apart. My hands fly into them, breaking their skin - I pull out hearts and intestines and toss them aside. I do head-crushings, beheadings, some work with baseball bats-the variety and degree of punishment depending on the offender and the offense. Those whom I don't like or my mother doesn't like in the first place get the worst - usually long, drawn-out strangulations, faces of red then purple then mauve. Those I barely know, like the family that just walked by, are spared the worst-nothing personal. I'll run them over with my car. We are both distantly worried about the bleeding nose, my mother and I, but are for the time being working under the assumption that the nose will stop bleeding. While I hold her nose she holds the half-moon receptacle as it rests on the upper portion of her chest, under her chin. Just then I have a great idea. I try to get her to talk funny, the way people talk when their nose is being held. \"Please?\" I say. \"No,\" she says. \"C'mon.\" \"Cut it out.\" \"What?\" My mother's hands are veiny and strong. Her neck has veins. Her back has freckles. She used to do a trick where it looked like she would be pulling off her thumb, when in fact she was not. Do you know this trick? Part of one's right thumb is made to look like part of one's left hand, and then is slid up and down the index finger of the left finger-attached, then detached. It's an unsettling trick, and more so when my mother used to do it, because she did it in a way where her hands sort of shook, vibrated, her neck's veins protruding and taut, her face gripped with the strain plausibly attendant to pulling off one's finger. As children, we watched with both glee and terror. We knew it was not real, we had seen it dozens of times, but its power was never diminished, because my mother's was a uniquely physical presence - she was all skin and muscles. We would make her do the trick for our friends, who were also horrified and enthralled. But kids loved her. Everyone knew her from school - she directed the plays in grade school, would take in kids who were going through divorces, knew and loved and was not shy about hugging any of them, especially the shy ones - there was an effortless kind of understanding, an utter lack of doubt about what she was doing that put people at ease, so unlike some of the mothers, so brittle and unsure. Of course, if she didn't like someone, that kid knew it. Like Dean Baldwin, the beefy, dirty-blond boy up the block, who would stand in the street and, unprovoked, give her the finger as she drove by. \"Bad kid,\" she would say, and she meant it - she had an inner hardness that under no circumstances did you want to trifle with - and would have him struck from her list until the second he might say sorry (Dean unfortunately did not), at which time he would have gotten a hug like anyone else. As strong as she was physically, most of the power was in her eyes, small and blue, and when she squinted, she would squint with a murderous intensity that meant, unmistakably, that, if pushed, she would deliver on her stare's implied threat, that to protect what she cared about, she would not stop, that she would run right over you. But she wore her strength casually, had a trusting carelessness with her flesh and muscles. She would cut herself while slicing vegetables, cut the living shit out of her finger, usually her thumb, and it would bleed everywhere, on the tomatoes, the cutting board, in the sink, while we watched at her waist, awed, scared she would die. But she would just grimace, wash the thumb clean under the tap, wrap the thumb in a paper towel and keep cutting, while the blood slowly soaked through the paper towel, crawling, as blood crawls, outward from the wound's wet center.",

      "body": "<p><strong>For which county did Julius Caesar play?</strong> asks C Barkis</p> <p>I'm certainly willing to answer this one. Julius Caesar played for Surrey, from 1849 to 1867. He was a right-hand batsman, who occasionally opened, and a fastish right-arm roundarm bowler. He was a member of the first touring team from England which went abroad, to North America in 1859, and also toured Australia in 1863-64. He fell on hard times, and died in poverty in 1878, aged only 47. If you'd like to know more about him, a book subtitled \"The Ill-Fated Cricketer\", by Geoff Amey, came out recently. You can get it by sending a cheque for \u00a310.95 (\u00a32 extra if outside UK) to Bodyline Books, the publishers, at 150a Harbord Street, London SW6 6PH. Or you can order it by e-mail from cricket@dircon.co.uk. </p> <p><strong>I was away on holiday when England's winter teams were announced (I even missed the Oval climax!). Can you tell me what exact role Martyn Moxon is undertaking this winter?</strong> asks Mick Pope </p> <p>Moxon, the former Yorkshire and England opener who is now Yorkshire's director of cricket, is the assistant coach for the one-day section of England's tour of Pakistan. He also did the job in Kenya, when he was unlucky enough to be the fall guy wheeled out on television when England were bowled out for 182 by South Africa. I always thought Moxon had an unlucky international career: he's one of those unfortunate souls whose highest Test score was 99. His came against New Zealand at Auckland in 1987-88 - and he was more unlucky than most, because midway through his innings a leg-glance for four was given as four leg-byes. </p> <p><strong>Which county has won the Championship most often?</strong> asks Les Wheatley </p> <p>Since the County Championship was properly constituted in 1890, it has been won most often by Yorkshire - 29 times, plus a joint title in 1949 (shared with Middlesex). But Yorkshire haven't won it since 1968. Surrey, the champions in each of the last two seasons, are second with 17 Championship titles. Middlesex have won ten, Lancashire seven, Essex and Kent six, Warwickshire and Worcestershire five, Nottinghamshire four, Glamorgan and Leicestershire three, Hampshire two, and Derbyshire one (in 1936). </p> <p><strong>Why was the rest day of the Golden Jubilee Test between India and England in 1980 brought forward?</strong> asks Brad Riley </p> <p>There was no play on what should have been the second day of that Test at Bombay - February 16, 1980 - because of an eclipse of the sun. The match, which was staged to mark the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Indian Board, was dominated by Ian Botham, who scored 114 and took 13 wickets (6 for 58 and 7 for 48) as England won by ten wickets. Bob Taylor, England's wicketkeeper, took seven catches in the first innings, to equal the Test record, and ten in the match (a Test record at the time, since beaten by Jack Russell). The Indians might have been a bit tired: it was their 17th Test in the space of seven months. </p> <p><strong>How are batting averages calculated for individual players?</strong> asks Kartik Deora </p> <p>It's fairly simple really. You add up the runs a batsman has scored, and divide that total by the number of completed innings he has had. So if you score 125 runs in ten completed innings then your batting average is 12.50. The thing to remember is that it is completed innings: ones where the batsman is not out or retired hurt don't count. Some people have run up unlikely averages by avoiding getting out - Bill Johnston, a bowler with few pretensions to batting, managed to average 102.00 with the bat on Australia's 1953 tour of England by avoiding dismissal in 16 of his 17 innings on the tour. </p> <p><strong>I play cricket in the Jakarta League (yes, there is one) which over the years has seen some excellent players, including the former Australian batsman Gary Cosier, come and go. The standard is still surprisingly high. One of the best who still plays is Raymund Shakespeare. He once hit a double-century in 35 overs! I gather that he played first-class cricket in the UK. Do you have any more information about his career?</strong> asks Roderick Brazier </p> <p>Sorry to spoil a good story, but no-one called Raymund Shakespeare appears to have played first-class cricket in England.

Alvin Cohan of London was, we reported, incensed to find that the \u00a325 saver fare he'd booked each week for the past three years had been banished from the 8.35am from Euston. Instead he was obliged to find \u00a3155. Virgin initially blamed heavy commuter use, but reassessed the service after Consumer's call and restored the old fare. Unfair, wails Ian Reader of Lancaster. \"Why,\" he asks, \"does Virgin continue to charge people travelling before 9am in the other direction \u00a3155? Isn't this discrimination?\" </p> <p>\u0095No, it's responsible business management, says Virgin. \"Fares tend to be calculated train- by-train rather than route-by-route and are determined by the level of business traffic on each service,\" explains a spokesman. </p> <p>\"Trains to London are heavily used at peak time and if we didn't restrict saver tickets, leisure travellers would crowd out those who need to get to work.\" There you are Mr Reader, you should be grateful that you have the chance to pay a \u00a3130 supplement to secure a seat! </p> <p><strong> More Virgin woes</strong> </p> <p> Martin Wright of Parbold in Lancashire says he had the same experience as Alvin Cohan, but no such happy ending. For the past few years he has caught the 6.14am from Wigan to London each Monday and paid \u00a320 for a saver fare. </p> <p>Suddenly, however, this ticket was withdrawn and he was left with a standard return at \u00a3143. As usual, Virgin argued that it was because the train was much used by business travellers and it was therefore losing potential revenue. Now, Wright says, it's three-quarters empty - so where's the gain in that? </p> <p>Up in Preston, Phil Brown is raging over the withdrawal of all fare discounts from services leaving for London before 9.20am. Even then, it's only possible to buy a Business Saver costing a distressing \u00a3100 - Saver tickets aren't available until 10.20 which means, Brown concludes, that Virgin defines peak period as lasting until 12.15, the time the 9.20 gets into London. \"I understand that the reason Virgin gives for stopping the cheap advance tickets last month is that it is working from its winter timetable. Apparently people do not wish to purchase cheap tickets in 'winter'.\" </p> <p>\u0095Consumer invited Virgin to comment but its reply, like so many of its trains, has been delayed. By the way, if any of you experienced the eccentricities of the privatised fare system - which can make it cheaper to buy, say, two or three tickets for each stage of a journey rather than one through ticket - we'd like to hear from you. </p> <p><strong> Vanishing tickets</strong> </p> <p> Poor Graham Wigmore never even saw the tickets he'd paid for.

      "body": "<p> Don't look now but a solitary vice is taking Britain by storm: short text messaging from mobile phones. In August, 560m text messages were sent in the UK, according to the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) Association, more than 10 times the 50m recorded in May, 1999. Worldwide , the number of short text messages sent to mobile phones this month will reach 10bn, compared with one billion only 16 months ago, according to the GSM Association. </p> <p>That works out at nearly two for every person on the planet, though most of the world's population don't have a telephone, let alone a mobile. Text messaging is now more popular than emai (currently running at 10bn posts a year), even though it is much younger as a recreational activity. The reason, presumably, is that text messages are shorter and sent more frequently from a wider user base (mobiles) than emails, which are usually transmitted from a personal computer.</p> <p> IDC, the IT research firm, predicted this week that email traffic would reach a \"staggering\" 35bn a day by 2005 If present trends continue, text messaging will be far bigger. Like it or hate it, text messaging is the fastest growing communication phenomenon of all time. And it is still in diapers. There are two interesting facts about the growth of the short messaging system (SMS) which are also shared with email. </p> <p>The first is that success was achieved with minimal spending on advertising. I'm pushed to think of a single advert urging me to SMS a friend. What happened was that supply created its own demand. Once the capacity to deliver messages instantly and cheaply was available, the message spread round the world by \"viral\" marketing, or word-of-mouth. </p> <p> Viral marketing was unintentionally invented by Netscape over six years ago when it made copies of its browser freely available over the web, a decision that led to tens of millions being down loaded within months. </p> <p> This lesson has yet to be learned by the so-called dot.com companies selling to the consumer which have crippled themselves with huge marketing costs to establish their new brands. The difference is they are selling old economy goods over the internet rather than digital products like email that are intrinsic to the web. However, this problem won't last much longer: not because dot.coms will have found a solution but because they will have stopped calling themselves dot.coms.</p> <p> They are now reinventing themselves as software engineers or providers of merchandising solutions in order to have any chance of crossing a venture capitalist's threshold before they are shown the door. Viral marketing is still booming. At last week's World Internet Summit in London, I bumped into Yossi Vardi, founder of ICQ, the hugely successful messaging company subsequently sold to AOL for $407 million. His latest venture, which speeds updownload times, has topped seven million downloads. He says he has never spent a penny on advertising. </p> <p> The second interestingfactor is what effect short messaging will have on information overload. Overload has been talked about years but it is only now starting to bite. Four years ago I wrote an article about information overload in the Guardian but I didn't know the half of it. The problem then was mainly \"static\" overload - the fact that there was so much information on the web that it was difficult to know where to start to look. </p> <p> That problem is even worse now but at least it is static - you don't need to browse if you don't want to. Static overload has always been a problem in the sense that there has always been too much information in the world to absorb. The information revolution simply brought an age-old problem to the desktop. </p> <p> But \"dynamic\" overload - the tidal wave of emails, now joined now by short messages - is different. It is aimed at your screen and demands a response - often instant - and is now threatening to become counter productive. </p> <p> Emailing quickly became a tool for competitive advantage because of the way it could cut response times, instantly disseminate information throughout the country, and cut through artificial corporate layers created by geography and bureaucracy. Now it is different. Managers are finding they can't cope with 100, even 200 emails a day: everyone in the company wants to send them a blind copy of what they are doing and outside organisations and individuals can get through to them immediately without going through the secretarial filter. Employees now send emails to colleagues sitting next to them rather than speak - so they remain on the record and aren't the victim of a memory lapse. </p> <p> It has got to the stage where busy executives have stopped opening all their emails because they simply can't. One US businessman admitted to the Wall Street Journal that he had 1,059 unopened \"carbon copy\" emails. Another confessed he had gone back to using the telephone or voice-mail because it was more personal. Communications that aren't recognisable aren't even opened. They have become a new kind of junk mail. This is a sea change, because with letters, at least you knew someone wasopening them. </p> <p> Some managers now employ more not fewer secretaries to cope with email overload. Others print them out, hoping to go through them later - a resolution that soon gets broken once a few more hundred emails have arrived. </p> <p> No one has yet found an answer to email overload, except to make sure that you answer every one you open immediately - a resolution that inevitably leads you to open fewer in the first place. What will happen when text messages - now the plaything of the younger generation - seep into corporate culture can only be guessed at. In theory, they are lethally efficient. They go straight to the person you want to reach, they are concise, and can be read in a meeting without disruption and instantaneously responded to. But they will add yet another layer to corporate overload because they will be in addition to all the emails, voice mails and letters already received. Goodness knows what will happen when executives start getting 100 short text messages a day (you will, you will) on top of everything else. </p> <p> The only sure thing is that the communications revolution will end up with less not more communication.</p>",

There are two interesting facts about the growth of the short messaging system (SMS) which are also shared with email. The first is that success was achieved with minimal spending on advertising. I'm pushed to think of a single advert urging me to SMS a friend. What happened was that supply created its own demand. Once the capacity to deliver messages instantly and cheaply was available, the message spread round the world by \"viral\" marketing, or word-of-mouth. Viral marketing was unintentionally invented by Netscape over six years ago when it made copies of its browser freely available over the web, a decision that led to tens of millions being down loaded within months. This lesson has yet to be learned by the so-called dot.com companies selling to the consumer which have crippled themselves with huge marketing costs to establish their new brands. The difference is they are selling old economy goods over the internet rather than digital products like email that are intrinsic to the web. However, this problem won't last much longer: not because dot.coms will have found a solution but because they will have stopped calling themselves dot.coms. They are now reinventing themselves as software engineers or providers of merchandising solutions in order to have any chance of crossing a venture capitalist's threshold before they are shown the door. Viral marketing is still booming. At last week's World Internet Summit in London, I bumped into Yossi Vardi, founder of ICQ, the hugely successful messaging company subsequently sold to AOL for $407 million. His latest venture, which speeds updownload times, has topped seven million downloads. He says he has never spent a penny on advertising. The second interestingfactor is what effect short messaging will have on information overload. Overload has been talked about years but it is only now starting to bite. Four years ago I wrote an article about information overload in the Guardian but I didn't know the half of it. The problem then was mainly \"static\" overload - the fact that there was so much information on the web that it was difficult to know where to start to look. That problem is even worse now but at least it is static - you don't need to browse if you don't want to. Static overload has always been a problem in the sense that there has always been too much information in the world to absorb. The information revolution simply brought an age-old problem to the desktop. But \"dynamic\" overload - the tidal wave of emails, now joined now by short messages - is different. It is aimed at your screen and demands a response - often instant - and is now threatening to become counter productive. Emailing quickly became a tool for competitive advantage because of the way it could cut response times, instantly disseminate information throughout the country, and cut through artificial corporate layers created by geography and bureaucracy. Now it is different. Managers are finding they can't cope with 100, even 200 emails a day: everyone in the company wants to send them a blind copy of what they are doing and outside organisations and individuals can get through to them immediately without going through the secretarial filter. Employees now send emails to colleagues sitting next to them rather than speak - so they remain on the record and aren't the victim of a memory lapse. It has got to the stage where busy executives have stopped opening all their emails because they simply can't. One US businessman admitted to the Wall Street Journal that he had 1,059 unopened \"carbon copy\" emails. Another confessed he had gone back to using the telephone or voice-mail because it was more personal. Communications that aren't recognisable aren't even opened. They have become a new kind of junk mail. This is a sea change, because with letters, at least you knew someone wasopening them. Some managers now employ more not fewer secretaries to cope with email overload. Others print them out, hoping to go through them later - a resolution that soon gets broken once a few more hundred emails have arrived. No one has yet found an answer to email overload, except to make sure that you answer every one you open immediately - a resolution that inevitably leads you to open fewer in the first place. What will happen when text messages - now the plaything of the younger generation - seep into corporate culture can only be guessed at. In theory, they are lethally efficient. They go straight to the person you want to reach, they are concise, and can be read in a meeting without disruption and instantaneously responded to. But they will add yet another layer to corporate overload because they will be in addition to all the emails, voice mails and letters already received. Goodness knows what will happen when executives start getting 100 short text messages a day (you will, you will) on top of everything else. The only sure thing is that the communications revolution will end up with less not more communication.",

He punched and kicked me. The physical damage he caused was no more than deep bruising, but the psychological damage was profound. It changed my view of who I was. I no longer felt safe doing a job I had previously known I was good at. I felt fear where before I had felt confidence. I didn't want revenge - I just wanted to hide away because at some level I couldn't escape the idea that, somehow, it had been my fault.</p> <p>Such beliefs are reinforced by authority all the time. Judges who indicate that rape victims were somehow asking for it because of the way they dressed or where they were; police officers who warn women not to go out alone when a rapist or a killer is on the loose, imposing a curfew on the victims rather than the perpetrators; people who criticise those women who endure domestic violence rather than walk away.</p> <p>All of this contributes to the insidious growth of fear. Culturally, in spite of the changes wrought by feminism, most women are still relatively powerless compared with men. And, whether consciously or subconsciously, it works to men's advantage to keep us scared.</p> <p>Women are more likely than men to experience harassment at work and on the street. Once you have been harassed, it's a lot easier to imagine how that could escalate into something worse. And, of course, once you have been on the receiving end of violence, you are much more likely to live in fear that it could happen again because you know what it does to you. Women who have experienced domestic violence consistently report higher levels of fear in public places.</p> <p>Sometimes, too, the response to violence against women seems wilfully lacking in sensitivity. The fear that if something does happen to you, it won't be taken seriously, also feeds into a general sense of apprehension and insecurity, and is the reason why so many women don't report minor or even major assaults.</p> <p>Of course, when a survey like this appears, there is always a scurrying around to find an acceptable scapegoat. One easy target is the dramatisation of crime that takes place in the media and the arts. This is not without some basis in truth. One academic study found that in Britain, readers of tabloid newspapers with more sensational crime coverage reported higher levels of fear than those who obtained their news from the broadsheets. Most women I know won't turn on programmes such as Crimewatch UK because they feel they are designed to jack up viewers' adrenaline levels and make us more afraid.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we still watch dramas like Without Reason, in which young women are abducted, abused and gruesomely murdered. We still devour serial killer thrillers in which women like us are regularly treated as disposable victims whose sole function in the novel is to be taken, tortured and terminated to satisfy the desires of yet another psychopath.</p> <p>I like to think that I write rather more thoughtfully than that; tot up the victims in my 15 novels and you will see I'm pretty much an equal opportunities murderer. But I admit that when I write about extreme violence, I intend my readers to flinch. It's important to me that my portrayal of the terrible things people do to each other - and, believe me, the real world is infinitely worse than anything I have ever invented - is rooted in a reality in which violence really does hurt.

      "byline": "Matt Wells, media correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>BBC1 and ITV tore up the television schedules yesterday as the ratings battle between the two broadcasters intensified. </p> <p>The BBC is shifting its ailing drama Hope and Glory to Sundays, while ITV continues to shore up its schedule with careful placing of its popular game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? </p> <p>Observers say the BBC and ITV are involved in a battle that neither can afford to lose - but both channels appear to be risking the wrath of viewers who have little idea where their favourite shows will turn up next. </p> <p>\"We are in a competitive and ruthless scheduling environment,\" said the BBC's head of scheduling, Adam MacDonald. </p> <p>The ratings war follows the BBC's decision to switch its evening news from 9pm to 10pm. The chairman of the BBC governors, Sir Christopher Bland, defended the move last night after hints from ministers that the corporation would be placed under independent regulators: \"It is a demonstration of the independence of the governors that, despite that threat, we still took what we believe to be the right decision.\" </p> <p>But Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of the independent television commission, which recently allowed ITV to move its 11pm news back to 10pm on three days a week, said the BBC had gone \"beyond the boundary of fair competition\". </p> <p>As the war of words waged last night, both broadcasters continue to employ surreptitious tactics that are more common in the United States: the latest weapon was deployed on Tuesday night, the second day of the new schedule, when ITV screened a 10-minute news special from ITN at 9pm about the Hatfield train crash. </p> <p>ITV's previous unscheduled mid-evening bulletins have been fronted by the Nightly News presenter, Dermot Murnaghan, but the crash special was introduced by Sir Trevor McDonald, who is also expected to be named soon as the anchorman for the network's revived News at 10. </p> <p>From the beginning of November, BBC1 is moving its poorly performing Lenny Henry vehicle, Hope and Glory, from Thursday to Sunday. </p> <p>After being absent for a fortnight, the ailing hospital series Holby City returns on Thursdays - but an hour later than usual to avoid taking a hammering from Millionaire. It will run head-to-head with ITV's popular new series, Fat Friends. </p> <p>The BBC is also planning to air several editions of its hit daytime quiz show, The Weakest Link, in peak time. Mr MacDonald said: \"We haven't changed our scheduling policy - it's not as if we're doing anything different from what we've always done.\" </p> <p>Figures released yesterday showed that ITV's news special drew 8.5m viewers on Tuesday, far more than used to watch the BBC Nine O'Clock News.

      "bodyText": "BBC1 and ITV tore up the television schedules yesterday as the ratings battle between the two broadcasters intensified. The BBC is shifting its ailing drama Hope and Glory to Sundays, while ITV continues to shore up its schedule with careful placing of its popular game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire? Observers say the BBC and ITV are involved in a battle that neither can afford to lose - but both channels appear to be risking the wrath of viewers who have little idea where their favourite shows will turn up next. \"We are in a competitive and ruthless scheduling environment,\" said the BBC's head of scheduling, Adam MacDonald. The ratings war follows the BBC's decision to switch its evening news from 9pm to 10pm. The chairman of the BBC governors, Sir Christopher Bland, defended the move last night after hints from ministers that the corporation would be placed under independent regulators: \"It is a demonstration of the independence of the governors that, despite that threat, we still took what we believe to be the right decision.\" But Sir Robin Biggam, chairman of the independent television commission, which recently allowed ITV to move its 11pm news back to 10pm on three days a week, said the BBC had gone \"beyond the boundary of fair competition\". As the war of words waged last night, both broadcasters continue to employ surreptitious tactics that are more common in the United States: the latest weapon was deployed on Tuesday night, the second day of the new schedule, when ITV screened a 10-minute news special from ITN at 9pm about the Hatfield train crash. ITV's previous unscheduled mid-evening bulletins have been fronted by the Nightly News presenter, Dermot Murnaghan, but the crash special was introduced by Sir Trevor McDonald, who is also expected to be named soon as the anchorman for the network's revived News at 10. From the beginning of November, BBC1 is moving its poorly performing Lenny Henry vehicle, Hope and Glory, from Thursday to Sunday. After being absent for a fortnight, the ailing hospital series Holby City returns on Thursdays - but an hour later than usual to avoid taking a hammering from Millionaire. It will run head-to-head with ITV's popular new series, Fat Friends. The BBC is also planning to air several editions of its hit daytime quiz show, The Weakest Link, in peak time. Mr MacDonald said: \"We haven't changed our scheduling policy - it's not as if we're doing anything different from what we've always done.\" Figures released yesterday showed that ITV's news special drew 8.5m viewers on Tuesday, far more than used to watch the BBC Nine O'Clock News. It was, however, boosted by its position between The Bill and A Touch of Frost. BBC1's premiere of the sci-fi comedy blockbuster Men in Black drew an average audience of 9.8m on Tuesday, against 7.5m for Frost. The BBC's new Ten O'Clock News continued to build its audience with 6.1m, almost a million up on the average for the old 9pm news. Provisional figures also showed the BBC dominated the 6.30pm to 10.30pm peak time period with 37.5% of viewers against ITV's 33.4%. As the two principal networks slug it out, BBC2, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are all being squeezed. The fight for viewers: Junction management Often used by ITV, which on Monday brought forward the ad break that was due to follow Who Wants to be a Millionaire? into the programme itself, meaning the show over-ran by four minutes. Result: viewers were transported straight into the Frank Skinner Show without a break, and those who turned to BBC news had missed the 10pm headlines. For its part, the BBC started One Foot in the Grave at 8.58pm, hooking in viewers before they had a chance to switch over. End credit promotions In its simplest form, a continuity announcer whets viewers' appetite with \"next on BBC1...\" as the credits roll. And for two years, Chris Tarrant has closed Millionaire with a mention for the subsequent ITV show. But the marketeers are getting more sophisticated: both BBC and ITV have begun to incorporate fully -produced promotional films into the end credits of big shows such as EastEnders and Coronation Street. Stunt scheduling Millionaire is described by BBC executives as an \"exocet missile\" - it destroys everything in sight. But the BBC has begun to hit back: in a fortnight, it will screen two half-hour editions of EastEnders on Tuesday, \"hammocked\" around a special peaktime edition of the hit Anne Robinson daytime game show, The Weakest Link. On Thursday, it screens an hour-long EastEnders special to mark the departure of Frank Butcher from Albert Square.

The statistics themselves are scary.</p> <p>The average American adult is expected to spend $43 (\u00a330) on celebrating October 31, making Halloween the second biggest holiday after Christmas in terms of dollars spent, according to the International Mass Retail Association, a trade body.</p> <p>Most of the money (an estimated $1.9bn in total) will be spent on sweets. Seven out of 10 Americans said they would be handing out treats to ward off tricks in a survey carried out by American Demographics last year. So great is the demand for such ransom that one quarter of all confectionery bought in the US is purchased in the two months running up to November 10.</p> <p>An estimated $1.5bn is also expected to be spent on costumes. The association does not break this figure down into regions, but New York City must contribute more than its fair share. The annual Greenwich Village parade attracts thousands of participants as well as onlookers wearing fancy dress. Last year featured men dressed as the queen from Star Wars or Dr Evil. Charlie's Angels are expected to be big this year, thus the run on wigs for all those Farrah lookalikes.</p> <p>The rest of the country also likes to dress up for Halloween. According to the International Retail Marketing Association, between 40 and 60% of all adults between the age of 18 and 44 said they intended to dress up in 1998. Eight per cent of them said they intended to dress their pets.</p> <p>The four-year-old Halloween Association, a sort of trade body for hobgoblins, has estimated that about $6bn will be spent on the festivities this year, up from $5bnn last year. On top of sweets and costumes are decorations, entertaining and greeting cards. Hallmark Cards says it sells about 23-26m Halloween cards each year.

      "bodyText": "Rising oil prices may be prompting fears of a fuel shortage on the north-east coast of America, but long, blonde wigs and pumpkins are really flying out of the shops. Halloween is huge in America and this year is expected to be bigger than most. The statistics themselves are scary. The average American adult is expected to spend $43 (\u00a330) on celebrating October 31, making Halloween the second biggest holiday after Christmas in terms of dollars spent, according to the International Mass Retail Association, a trade body. Most of the money (an estimated $1.9bn in total) will be spent on sweets. Seven out of 10 Americans said they would be handing out treats to ward off tricks in a survey carried out by American Demographics last year. So great is the demand for such ransom that one quarter of all confectionery bought in the US is purchased in the two months running up to November 10. An estimated $1.5bn is also expected to be spent on costumes. The association does not break this figure down into regions, but New York City must contribute more than its fair share. The annual Greenwich Village parade attracts thousands of participants as well as onlookers wearing fancy dress. Last year featured men dressed as the queen from Star Wars or Dr Evil. Charlie's Angels are expected to be big this year, thus the run on wigs for all those Farrah lookalikes. The rest of the country also likes to dress up for Halloween. According to the International Retail Marketing Association, between 40 and 60% of all adults between the age of 18 and 44 said they intended to dress up in 1998. Eight per cent of them said they intended to dress their pets. The four-year-old Halloween Association, a sort of trade body for hobgoblins, has estimated that about $6bn will be spent on the festivities this year, up from $5bnn last year. On top of sweets and costumes are decorations, entertaining and greeting cards. Hallmark Cards says it sells about 23-26m Halloween cards each year. The company offers 250 different types of pumpkin-decorated cards, including 40 that are animated. Drive out of Manhattan and pumpkins really are the only fruit. Shops, restaurants and homes have displays that would put an Oxford Street window to shame. One huge, detached house in Long Island has created a sort of high altar with gossamer butterflies and such a glut of gourds that the occupants could live off pumpkin soup until next year. Mary Helen Sprecher, spokeswoman for the Halloween Association, said demand for motion-activated decorations, fake gravestones and heads that scream in the night had really taken off in the last few years. \"Some of these decorations are worthy of professionals,\" she said. Like most spectacles in prosperous, turn-of-the-century America, the chief cause of the increasingly exuberant nature of Halloween is the baby-boomer generation born after 1945.

It was not clear whether the missing suspects were the two men who manoeuvred their small boat alongside the USS Cole and blew themselves up, or whether they were technicians spirited out of the country after the attack. Paying tribute to the Cole victims, Mr Clinton said: \"To those who attacked them we say: You will not find a safe harbour. We will find you and justice will prevail. America will not stop standing guard for peace, for freedom or stability in the Middle East or around the world.\" Vincent Cannistraro, the CIA's former head of counter-terrorist operations and a respected expert on Middle Eastern terrorism, said the timing, location and method of the attack pointed to Bin Laden's terrorist network, al-Qaeda. He said it was the only group in the area which has issued a fatwa (a religiously inspired death sentence) against US and British citizens. Bin Laden, a Saudi national based in Afghanistan, has Yemeni family roots and close links with some of the local tribal warlords. A few weeks before the attack, he distributed a video in which he issued familiar calls for a holy war against the \"forces of evil\". He was wearing Yemeni tribal costume and a Yemeni dagger. \"He's puckish like that. On one hand he does not want to give out his address, but on the other hand, he likes to let his followers know he is leading the fight,\" Mr Cannistraro said. He argued that the sophistication of the bomb - an estimated 272kg of high explosive shaped and placed within a metal container to channel the blast and penetrate the armoured hull of the USS Cole - suggested the involvement of a state. \"The Iraqis have wanted to be able to carry out terrorism for some time now,\" Mr Cannistraro said. \"Their military people have had liaison with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and could well have supplied the training.\" He said the theory was still speculative but was consistent with the series of recent contacts between Baghdad and the Bin Laden organisation. Harvey Kushner, a terrorism expert at Long Island University, said there was reason to believe Bin Laden had been investigating ways of launching attacks by sea. \"He's been looking around for small, personal submarines. One of his relatives in the United States had an order in for one of these personal submarines, and it was stopped,\" Mr Kushner said. Other terrorism experts agreed the boat bomb was a significant technical advance on earlier terrorist attacks, such as the bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania two years ago. The bodies of six of the US sailors killed in the blast were still being extracted from the wreckage left by the blast, which punched a 12-metre hole in the ship. Investigators in Aden were studying video surveillance tapes of the port from the hours leading up to the attack.",

That meeting was ill-prepared, and it failed.</p> <p>As a result, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, withdrew Israeli forces from southern Lebanon, hoping to weaken Syria's future bargaining position. In our view, this has also contributed to subsequent violence, and Mr Barak must carry some responsibility.</p> <p>By withdrawing unilaterally, outside the framework of a comprehensive settlement with Syria and Lebanon, Mr Barak gave the Hizbullah guerrillas an opportunity to claim victory. This raised a question in many Arab minds as to whether Hizbullah's methods might not be more effective than the peace process as a means towards achieving Palestinian goals.</p> <p>Secondly, the withdrawal marked Israel's full compliance with UN resolutions on Lebanon. This led many Arabs to ask why, if the Israelis were able to comply with those resolutions, they could not comply with other resolutions about Palestine. So far, Mr Barak has not provided a satisfactory answer.</p> <p>The Israeli withdrawal thus produced a hardening of attitudes among Arabs and provided a rationale for alternative \"violent\" approaches in the event that the peace process became stalled.</p> <p>We turn now to the Camp David summit, which you called last July.

But you had none.</p> <p>Perhaps you imagined that your personal charms, which worked so well on Monica Lewinsky, would also work on Messrs Arafat and Barak. But they didn't. Your achievement at Camp David was to stir up the worst fears on both sides about their respective leaders, leaving both Mr Barak and Mr Arafat at the mercy of their own rejectionists.</p> <p>After Camp David it was only a matter of time until something triggered violence.

Outside thousands lined the streets for the man who brought nationhood again to Scotland. It was, perhaps, the closest the country has come to a state funeral in modern times.</p> <p>But Donald Dewar was also a private man who suffered a lonely childhood, spent solitary Christmasses with his books and surrounded himself with only a few close friends. For that man, the marking of his passing would have been an embarrassing, though gratifying, affair. \"I wonder what Donald would have made of all this,\" said his friend and spokesman David Whitton.</p> <p><b> Philosophy</b><br></p> <p>His funeral said much about his life.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, of course, was there.The Prince of Wales, the Irish Taoiseach, the British and Scottish cabinets filled the pews. Alongside them, however, sat schoolchildren, pensioners and the canteen ladies who made his daily bacon rolls. The funeral of Donald Campbell Dewar was that sort of affair. Within the 800-year-old walls of Glasgow Cathedral, more than 1,300 people gathered yesterday in respect and celebration of the life of Scotland's first first minister. Outside thousands lined the streets for the man who brought nationhood again to Scotland. It was, perhaps, the closest the country has come to a state funeral in modern times. But Donald Dewar was also a private man who suffered a lonely childhood, spent solitary Christmasses with his books and surrounded himself with only a few close friends. For that man, the marking of his passing would have been an embarrassing, though gratifying, affair. \"I wonder what Donald would have made of all this,\" said his friend and spokesman David Whitton. Philosophy His funeral said much about his life. There was no special area set aside for the politicians and dignitaries: they sat among the ordinary people Mr Dewar spent his career trying to help.

      "bodyText": "Israel's dramatic capture of Palestinians suspected of involvement in last week's lynching of two soldiers in the West Bank fits into a long tradition of hunting down enemies with \"blood on their hands\" - however long it takes. Details remained sketchy last night, but the operation was reportedly the work of the Shin Bet security service, whose agents led the army to hiding places in the Ramallah area. Still stunned by the brutality of the killings - broadcast repeatedly on television since last Thursday - many saw a link to the far longer search for the Palestinians who murdered 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. In that case, the Mossad secret service spent years hunting down the members of the \"Black September\" team - who did much to draw attention to the Palestinian cause. One by one through the 70s and 80s the Munich killers and planners were targeted in Europe and the Middle East, although one innocent man, a Moroccan waiter working in Norway, was mistakenly assassinated. Israel denied links with the Mossad hit squads for years, but eventually admitted it had been responsible and had planned the revenge campaign at the highest levels. During that so-called \"war of the spooks\", a young Israeli special forces officer named Ehud Barak led one of the deadliest of a series of carefully planned attacks on key PLO targets. In 1973, Mr Barak, commander of the elite Sayeret Matkal unit, led a raid on Beirut, codenamed Springtime of Youth, in which three guerrilla leaders - and the wife of one of them - were gunned down in their homes. By contrast, the Palestinians captured after the Ramallah lynching, which took place inside the city's police station, are likely to stand trial. But it was clear from the start that the Israelis would ensure they did not escape retribution. Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, the deputy prime minister, issued a chilling warning hours after an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a rocket into the window through which the bodies of the two soldiers were thrown. \"We will get them, one by one,\" he declared. \"We will do whatever it takes and find them when they are least expecting us. These are not human beings but wild animals.\" The Israelis were middle-aged reservists who blundered into the Palestinian-controlled town on their way to report to their transport unit in a nearby Jewish settlement. The killing was a grave embarrassment for the Palestinian Authority as it gave Israel a grisly propaganda advantage that detracted from the media impact of far greater Palestinian losses - including many children - in repeated clashes with troops. Yasser Arafat was reported to have ordered that participants in the lynching be arrested. Speculation was rife last night that Palestinian security services had helped the Shin Bet track down the culprits, or at the very least turned a blind eye to an operation apparently conducted in Palestinian-controlled territory. Meanwhile, a correspondent for Italian state television, Rai, was ordered back to Rome after being rebuked for apologising to the Palestinian Authority for having handed over film of the lynching to the Israelis.

      "body": "<p>With her younger daughter perched on her hip and the elder tugging at the knees of her jeans, Manal Kamel points her free arm towards the opposite hill and the tank whose machine gun is pointing at her home.</p> <p>\"Just the sight of that tank is enough to panic us,\" she says. But the tank is there to stay. On Tuesday afternoon, about an hour after Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, agreed to end the violence, snipers perched on a neighbouring house opened up on the Jewish suburb of Gilo, a sprawl of low-rise apartment blocks 800 metres away. Israeli soldiers returned fire with machine guns. Yesterday, they enforced their positions around Gilo.</p> <p>Ms Kamel's home stands directly in their path. \"The bullets were falling like rain here. It was the most terrible thing. The children were taking their afternoon nap. It was very frightening.\"</p> <p>When the firing stopped, she took her children and fled to her mother's at the other end of Beit Jalla, a prosperous, mainly Christian village on the western fringes of Bethlehem.</p> <p>She felt no safer. \"Last night, I could not sleep because I kept thinking about my daughter. There is a big window in her room and the firing could start at any time.\"</p> <p>The Kamels came home yesterday morning, despite a warning from Israel's army for people living on Beit Jalla's firing line to evacuate their homes, or risk getting shot. But where else would Ms Kamel and her children go?</p> <p>Although the village is under Palestinian self-rule, the main road into Beit Jalla is blocked by an Israeli concrete guard post, and there is a strip of metal spikes on the road. The Israeli authorities have imposed closures on the West Bank and Gaza, barring Palestinians travelling to Israel proper.</p> <p>Ms Kamel is afraid that if she leaves her home, she may not be able to return for days. She and her husband, a candlemaker who supplies the churches of Beit Jalla and Bethlehem, have invested everything in this home.</p> <p>The family moved into the house nearly two years ago, a handsome two-storey building divided into four flats, one for each brother in an extended family. All enjoy spectacular views of a silvery-green olive grove, and the flats of Gilo.</p> <p>Nobody in the family has ever been to Gilo, built on illegally occupied Palestinian land which was later annexed to Jerusalem. There is a bridge spanning the valley, but it was built for cars speeding to other Jewish settlements to the south. Until the first of four recent gun battles between Beit Jalla and Gilo, it was as if their Jewish neighbours did not exist.</p> <p>Last night, the family was planning to bed down on mattresses on the floor of the back room.</p> <p>When the firing started on Tuesday, all seven children in the extended household were bundled downstairs to the basement in stages, the family huddling for intervals against the wall of the central stairwell. Ms Kamel's elder daugh ter, Juwana, an inquisitive girl in a tartan frock was old enough to understand what was happening, and she was terrified. \"She is four now and very sensitive. What can I explain to a little girl?\" she says.</p> <p>Shadia Bazazo, Ms Kamel's sister-in-law, has four older boys and her terrors are different. Across the valley from Bethlehem, they can hear the wake for Mohammed Jawarish, 14, who was shot dead by Israeli soldiers earlier in the week. \"We will keep struggling until we achieve victory,\" the mourners chant. \"We will take the same path as the martyrs.\"</p> <p>That is not the fate Ms Bazazo wants for her sons, aged 8 to 15.

      "bodyText": "With her younger daughter perched on her hip and the elder tugging at the knees of her jeans, Manal Kamel points her free arm towards the opposite hill and the tank whose machine gun is pointing at her home. \"Just the sight of that tank is enough to panic us,\" she says. But the tank is there to stay. On Tuesday afternoon, about an hour after Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, agreed to end the violence, snipers perched on a neighbouring house opened up on the Jewish suburb of Gilo, a sprawl of low-rise apartment blocks 800 metres away. Israeli soldiers returned fire with machine guns. Yesterday, they enforced their positions around Gilo. Ms Kamel's home stands directly in their path. \"The bullets were falling like rain here. It was the most terrible thing. The children were taking their afternoon nap. It was very frightening.\" When the firing stopped, she took her children and fled to her mother's at the other end of Beit Jalla, a prosperous, mainly Christian village on the western fringes of Bethlehem. She felt no safer. \"Last night, I could not sleep because I kept thinking about my daughter. There is a big window in her room and the firing could start at any time.\" The Kamels came home yesterday morning, despite a warning from Israel's army for people living on Beit Jalla's firing line to evacuate their homes, or risk getting shot. But where else would Ms Kamel and her children go? Although the village is under Palestinian self-rule, the main road into Beit Jalla is blocked by an Israeli concrete guard post, and there is a strip of metal spikes on the road. The Israeli authorities have imposed closures on the West Bank and Gaza, barring Palestinians travelling to Israel proper. Ms Kamel is afraid that if she leaves her home, she may not be able to return for days. She and her husband, a candlemaker who supplies the churches of Beit Jalla and Bethlehem, have invested everything in this home. The family moved into the house nearly two years ago, a handsome two-storey building divided into four flats, one for each brother in an extended family. All enjoy spectacular views of a silvery-green olive grove, and the flats of Gilo. Nobody in the family has ever been to Gilo, built on illegally occupied Palestinian land which was later annexed to Jerusalem. There is a bridge spanning the valley, but it was built for cars speeding to other Jewish settlements to the south. Until the first of four recent gun battles between Beit Jalla and Gilo, it was as if their Jewish neighbours did not exist. Last night, the family was planning to bed down on mattresses on the floor of the back room. When the firing started on Tuesday, all seven children in the extended household were bundled downstairs to the basement in stages, the family huddling for intervals against the wall of the central stairwell. Ms Kamel's elder daugh ter, Juwana, an inquisitive girl in a tartan frock was old enough to understand what was happening, and she was terrified. \"She is four now and very sensitive. What can I explain to a little girl?\" she says. Shadia Bazazo, Ms Kamel's sister-in-law, has four older boys and her terrors are different. Across the valley from Bethlehem, they can hear the wake for Mohammed Jawarish, 14, who was shot dead by Israeli soldiers earlier in the week. \"We will keep struggling until we achieve victory,\" the mourners chant. \"We will take the same path as the martyrs.\" That is not the fate Ms Bazazo wants for her sons, aged 8 to 15. It takes all her strength to keep the older boys from wandering down to Bethlehem to join the other kids throwing stones at Israeli soldiers. With exams coming up, she wants them to stay indoors and study. But they cannot concentrate. This is not the life she wanted, she says. \"The governments of the world should do something. Stones cannot make anything.\" But she understands the powers driving the young men to court death at the hands of Israeli troops. \"A lot of them have had a brother or a son killed in the shooting. If I were them, I would go out and throw stones too.\" Not her sister-in-law who is furious both at the Israelis and at the snipers who have been taking up positions on the neighbour's roof, putting them in the crossfire. \"I blame all of them,\" Ms Kamel says. \"We are the victims, stuck here in between them.\"",

All but three of those who needed hospital treatment were released and able to complete their journeys which began yesterday afternoon or returned home. Seven - six of them women - had been kept in overnight.

Among the injuries to the seven were a punctured lung, a broken leg and fractured vertebrae. Meanwhile, the police investigation centred on a 600 metre stretch of track strewn with debris and mangled metal. At 3pm yesterday, the carriages which had fallen on to their sides were lifted high enough so that officers could make sure that no one else had been trapped underneath.

It will be the first legislation in Britain outlawing discrimination on the grounds of religion and sexual orientation, and follows a landmark European Union directive rubber stamped by the European Council of ministers yesterday. The government must put in place a system of \"proportionate and persuasive\" legal sanctions to discourage discrimination which is likely to include financial compensation and mandatory reinstatement. The new anti-discrimination package will apply across all EU countries and was agreed after the government secured a series of opt outs. The outlawing of discrimination on the grounds of religion or sexual orientation must be in place by 2003, with provisions covering discrimination on age and disability following three years later. The home secretary Jack Straw had resisted calls from religious leaders for religious discrimination to be outlawed, but had commissioned more research into the issue. Muslims in particular felt that the scale of Islamaphobia they faced warranted legislation. Francis Maude MP, the shadow foreign secretary, attacked the government's decision to sign up to the directive: \"We believe it is right to strive for the elimination of discrimination in general, but we warned about the problems of this directive months ago.\" Claude Moraes MEP, Labour's European parliament spokesman for employment and social affairs, said: \"The government had taken the view that it's not desirable to extend the law to cover religious discrimination.

Train companies reported little reduction in the number of passengers using their reduced services and consequently trains were crowded. Major and minor roads around the site of the crash were congested due to part of the area being sealed off, and because a number of people drove rather than chance the trains. GNER, which operates from Kings Cross to the north-east of England and Scotland, managed to run about 90% of its 120 plus services. Delays of up to an hour, north and south-bound, were caused as trains were diverted off the east coast main line through Hertford. The speed restriction imposed on more than 12 stretches of line by Railtrack contributed to the delays. However, a spokesman for GNER said there had been \"no appreciable\" difference in the number of people travelling. With the weekend and the impending half-term, there is likely to be a surge in the number of people trying to use the railway and greater pressure on its services. WAGN Railways, which runs shorter distances services from Kings Cross, managed to keep about two thirds of its trains going. For the foreseeable future it will be operating on an emergency timetable. It had not noticed a drop in passenger numbers and many commuter trains arriving in London yesterday morning and returning to the suburbs last night were very crowded. It ran a number of bus services where stations such as Hatfield were closed down but a spokesman said that most people had been able to reach their destinations. For WAGN, the half-term will come as some relief as the number of commuters using the services will be greatly reduced. The roads around Hatfield and the A1M which runs a mile or so from the line were very busy. Traffic tailed back for several miles on the A1 at Stevenage about 10 miles north of Hatfield for much of the day and commuter traffic nearer London jammed the motorway and many of the feeder roads.

The verdict, after four years of research, could provide a clue as to why the composer sometimes behaved in strange and eccentric ways and may also be an explanation for his deafness. The findings, made by scientists attached to the Health Research Institute in Argonne, Chicago, clear up speculation surrounding the possible source of his illness. Analysis of his hair clippings showed that he had around 100 times the level of lead that would be normal in a person today. It is unclear how he came to be so badly poisoned, although one theory is that he could have ingested the lead through mineral waters taken at the many spas he visited. \"It was a surprise, but it stood out like a sore thumb in the analysis,\" said William Walsh, the director of the research project.

      "bodyText": "The section of railway track where a high speed train derailed killing four people was due to be inspected on the day of the disaster, it emerged yesterday. It was also revealed that the health and safety executive was checking other sections of track away from the Hatfield area, for fear that other faults may exist on sections of the high speed electrified East Coast route to the north from London. Railtrack, the privatised company which maintains the track, confirmed it was \"investigating the possibility of a broken rail being a factor in the tragedy\" after one was discovered at the crash scene - although at this stage it was not yet known if the rail broke before the accident or during it. The company, which admitted yesterday that the condition of the track at Hatfield was \"not good\", has fought a continuous battle to reduce the number of broken rails on the network. But after bringing down the annual number, Railtrack had to report a sharp rise in incidents in 1998-99. It was already under fire from both the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, and the railway inspectorate for its inability to drastically reduce the number of broken rails. In the aftermath of Tuesday's crash, Railtrack imposed a speed restriction on bends for high-speed lines throughout the country. Drivers will have to knock a third off their permitted speed in such areas, inevitably leading to delays for trains and their passengers. The RMT, the biggest rail union, said it had learned that one of Railtrack's contractors, Balfour Beatty, had reported to Railtrack on an increase in \"corner gauge cracking\" believed to have been caused by new locomotives. Corner gauge cracking refers to the wearing along the top corner edge of a rail. The union added that there was no indication of the actions taken by Railtrack arising from this information. Its assistant general secretary, Vernon Hince, said: \"We have constantly drawn attention to the conflict of interest between profit and safety in the privatised railway industry. \"This tragic incident re-emphasises the need for the government to instigate a complete examination of responsibility for rail safety.\" Track inspections were less frequent, said the union, and it was \"not surprising\" that broken rails increased by 42% between 1994-95 and 1998-99. Both Railtrack and GNER, the train operating company for the East Coast line, agreed the crash would lead to renewed anxiety among passengers. Railtrack's director for London and the north-east region, Nicholas Pollard, said he was aware that Railtrack could come under heavy fire if the crash were found to be caused by a fault with a rail. Preliminary investigations had found a smashed rail, he said, but it was not yet clear if the rail had broken before the accident or was a result of the crash. \"A rail is smashed up there. What we have got to understand is why that has happened and how it has happened,\" he said. \"We have no indication yet of whether it happened before or after.\" Speed limits had been imposed on sections of curved track across the UK; different areas of track have different limits, but Railtrack has reduced all the limits by a third - at Hatfield the limit was 115mph, he added. Railtrack said that the Hatfield area rails were inspected every week. October 10 had been the last time a \"track patrol\" made a visual inspection; the section had been due to be inspected on Tuesday, but this had not happened before the time of the crash. Stanley Hart, a principal inspector of railways for the health and safety executive, said vandalism had not been ruled out but seemed \"unlikely\". He said the executive was checking records of when the rails were last inspected and also checking other rails from the same batch as those at Hatfield. There were seven inspectors checking the scene of the accident and two inspectors elsewhere, though Mr Hart would not say where. Yesterday's derailment came on track that is continuously welded - which should greatly reduce the chances of a rail cracking, though defects can appear even in welded areas. Railtrack said in its most recent annual report that though the improvement in the number of broken rails last year was not enough, track quality was now better than at any time since the mid-1990s. It has also said that the growth of traffic on the network, particularly heavy freight, has had a major impact on track deterioration. It has been targeting renewals on locations where they would have the most effect. Railtrack has also spoken of introducing the UIC60 rail, the standard rail used in Europe, which is stronger than that used in the UK and requires less maintenance. It plans to replace an extra 350 miles of rail over the next five years. A total of 68,000 tonnes of new rail has been ordered for this year - the highest amount since 1988. Commenting on the possible reasons for the broken rail, David Johnson, a civil engineer with Laser Rail and Technology Services, said last night: \"If it is shown to be a rail break, one could question why the leading car had managed to stay on. \"It may suggest that possibly a rail break occurred under the train, as opposed to ahead of it, in which case an inspection may not have revealed anything.\" Track damage These are the most recent figures for broken rails and track buckles.

Except that this time the funeral was for a Real IRA man, and his killers were fellow republicans in the mainstream Provisional IRA.</p> <p>Only 300 came to send off Joe O'Connor, 26, from his mother's house in Ballymurphy, west Belfast - a fraction of the usual turn-out at such events. He had just left her home on Friday when he was shot five times in the head.</p> <p>Those there for his cortege included former leading lights in the IRA: Maria Price, convicted of bombing the Old Bailey in 1973; and ex-Belfast commander Brendan Hughes, a one-time associate of Gerry Adams. Also there was Francie Mackey, the Omagh councillor and chairman of the 32-county Sovereignty Movement, allied to the Real IRA.</p> <p>The republican split came over the Good Friday agreement, with the Real IRA, responsible for the Omagh bomb which killed 29 in August 1998, implacably opposed.</p> <p>Fresh graffiti around the estate derided the \"Ra\" in the crudest of terms, while Ms Price made scathing comments during the graveside oration, describing the mainstream group as the armed militia of the British state. At least one leading dissident was threatened on Tuesday by Provisional volunteers.</p> <p>There are fears that the murder, which may have been a row over the proceeds of smuggled cigarettes, will lead to more and more violence.

      "bodyText": "It was like old times in west Belfast yesterday, as republicans fired a volley of shots over the coffin covered with an Irish tricolour. Except that this time the funeral was for a Real IRA man, and his killers were fellow republicans in the mainstream Provisional IRA. Only 300 came to send off Joe O'Connor, 26, from his mother's house in Ballymurphy, west Belfast - a fraction of the usual turn-out at such events. He had just left her home on Friday when he was shot five times in the head. Those there for his cortege included former leading lights in the IRA: Maria Price, convicted of bombing the Old Bailey in 1973; and ex-Belfast commander Brendan Hughes, a one-time associate of Gerry Adams. Also there was Francie Mackey, the Omagh councillor and chairman of the 32-county Sovereignty Movement, allied to the Real IRA. The republican split came over the Good Friday agreement, with the Real IRA, responsible for the Omagh bomb which killed 29 in August 1998, implacably opposed. Fresh graffiti around the estate derided the \"Ra\" in the crudest of terms, while Ms Price made scathing comments during the graveside oration, describing the mainstream group as the armed militia of the British state. At least one leading dissident was threatened on Tuesday by Provisional volunteers. There are fears that the murder, which may have been a row over the proceeds of smuggled cigarettes, will lead to more and more violence. O'Connor was also said to have goaded several Provisional figures. The Provisional IRA leadership yesterday denied it was responsible for the murder. But the identities of the two hooded gunmen believed to be responsible are well-known, and both belong to that organisation. The theory is that the killing was not a sanctioned operation. The IRA said: \"The malicious accusations suggesting IRA involvement are designed to heighten tensions and promote the agenda of those opposed to the current IRA strategy.\" It said the Real IRA's threat to retaliate was exacerbating the situation.",

More than half had bought a product and recommended a supplier in the past year because of its responsible reputation. </p> <p>Ethical consumerism was worth more than \u00a38bn a year to the economy, the bank said.</p> <p><strong> CGNU defies sales trend</strong><br> </p> <p>CGNU, Britain's largest insurance group, reported a 21% increase in UK sales in the past nine months. The performance contrasted sharply with its rival Prudential, which announced weaker UK third-quarter sales on Tuesday. </p> <p>CGNU, created by the merger of CGU and Norwich Union in February, said sales in the UK were up 22% to \u00a35.5bn.

      "bodyText": "Leeson's boss faces queries Simon Jones, a former boss of rogue trader Nick Leeson, will be questioned over his behaviour in the scandal which brought down Barings Bank. A tribunal will hear complaints about his role in the management of Barings Futures (Singapore), following an investigation by the accountants' joint disciplinary committee. These include concerns over the accuracy of statements he made in connection with a 1993 audit and in the directors' statement published in financial documents in the same year. The tribunal, which is not expected to start until early next year, will also look into liaisons with the Singapore international monetary exchange. EC investigates \u00a350m aid plan The European commission said yesterday it would investigate a British government plan to provide \u00a350m over three years to set up and promote regional venture capital funds in England. \"Although the commission is in favour of promoting the supply of venture capital to small and medium-sized enterprises, it believes that care is needed when state aid is proposed to fulfil this objective,\" the commission said. \"In the current case, the state aid proposed does not fall within the existing rules for state aid which can be found compatible with the [EU] treaty.\" With unfortunate timing, the opening of the commission's inquiry coincided with the publication of a commission policy document calling for actions to stimulate the development of risk capital in Europe. The Conservative party was scathing, however, calling on trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers to apologise to small businesses for \"wasting their time and money preparing for grants he is not allowed to pay them\". Bank puts price on good name Making companies publish information on their green and social performance would allow consumers and investors to compare like with like, said Mervyn Pedelty, chief executive of the Co-operative Bank, which is noted for its ethical investment stance. His call came as the bank published a poll conducted by Mori in which one in six people said they frequently bought or boycotted products because of a manufacturer's reputation. More than half had bought a product and recommended a supplier in the past year because of its responsible reputation. Ethical consumerism was worth more than \u00a38bn a year to the economy, the bank said. CGNU defies sales trend CGNU, Britain's largest insurance group, reported a 21% increase in UK sales in the past nine months. The performance contrasted sharply with its rival Prudential, which announced weaker UK third-quarter sales on Tuesday. CGNU, created by the merger of CGU and Norwich Union in February, said sales in the UK were up 22% to \u00a35.5bn. Sector analysts said CGNU's figures looked reasonable given the general market slowdown.",

Tom White, 15, was told he could not travel to France on the watersports holiday with fellow pupils from Clitheroe Royal grammar school in Lancashire even though he had been allocated a place and paid a deposit. The decision came after he had his first severe hypoglycaemic attack - caused by a drop in blood-sugar levels - on a skiing trip last February. The school told his parents, Malcolm, 48, and Rosemary, 42, a lecturer of music, that Tom was also unable to take part in a German exchange visit, although he is studying for a GCSE in the language.

      "body": "<p>British Telecom faced an embarrassing setback to its mobile internet strategy when it said it did not know when its Genie portal would be fully operational, after more than a week of problems. </p> <p>Britain's leading multi-platform portal has been completely or partly out of action since October 11, when an upgrade scheduled to take 12 hours ran into problems. </p> <p>The failure could jeopardise BT Cellnet's lead over rival mobile operators, which view portals running on both desktop computers and cell phones as potential money spinners. </p> <p>Genie users were unable to access the desktop version of the site at all until the weekend, since when it has remained intermittently unavailable. </p> <p>One of the site's services, forwarding emails to mobile phones in the form of text messages, is still not working. A Genie spokesman claimed the site was fully operational, but an email received minutes later from Genie's customer care desk said it was still experiencing unexpected technical difficulties. </p> <p>\"This means it is taking longer than originally planned for the site to be fully operational. Although we do not have a time scale for a fix at the moment, we are told that the site will be running as soon as possible,\" the email said. </p> <p>The problems were caused by difficulties in transferring databases to the upgraded site, Genie said last week. </p> <p>Genie has been a rare internet success story for BT, attracting 1m users. </p> <p>\"I don't think they will lose large amounts of customers but their reputation will be tarnished as a result,\" said Dan Ridsdale, a mobile internet analyst at Nomura International. </p> <p>\u0095 BT said it was to receive a \u00a3250m refund following a five-year legal battle to reduce its local government business rates bills in England and Wales. </p> <p>BT also said in a statement that the rates bill next year for its network assets would be cut by \u00a3100m to \u00a3210m. </p> <p>The row centred on the valuation of BT's network assets such as street ducts, poles, cables, telephone kiosks, and microwave radio and satellite earth stations. </p> <p>BT said the case did not cover valuations for properties such as offices and shops. \"Traditionally these have been assessed in the conventional way.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "British Telecom faced an embarrassing setback to its mobile internet strategy when it said it did not know when its Genie portal would be fully operational, after more than a week of problems. Britain's leading multi-platform portal has been completely or partly out of action since October 11, when an upgrade scheduled to take 12 hours ran into problems. The failure could jeopardise BT Cellnet's lead over rival mobile operators, which view portals running on both desktop computers and cell phones as potential money spinners. Genie users were unable to access the desktop version of the site at all until the weekend, since when it has remained intermittently unavailable. One of the site's services, forwarding emails to mobile phones in the form of text messages, is still not working. A Genie spokesman claimed the site was fully operational, but an email received minutes later from Genie's customer care desk said it was still experiencing unexpected technical difficulties. \"This means it is taking longer than originally planned for the site to be fully operational. Although we do not have a time scale for a fix at the moment, we are told that the site will be running as soon as possible,\" the email said. The problems were caused by difficulties in transferring databases to the upgraded site, Genie said last week. Genie has been a rare internet success story for BT, attracting 1m users. \"I don't think they will lose large amounts of customers but their reputation will be tarnished as a result,\" said Dan Ridsdale, a mobile internet analyst at Nomura International. \u0095 BT said it was to receive a \u00a3250m refund following a five-year legal battle to reduce its local government business rates bills in England and Wales. BT also said in a statement that the rates bill next year for its network assets would be cut by \u00a3100m to \u00a3210m. The row centred on the valuation of BT's network assets such as street ducts, poles, cables, telephone kiosks, and microwave radio and satellite earth stations. BT said the case did not cover valuations for properties such as offices and shops. \"Traditionally these have been assessed in the conventional way.\"",

I think I recollect it, a flickering distraction from the papers I was reading on my way into King's Cross. I still haven't quite grasped the idea that while I was packing my bag and thinking about my lunch, the other train was being ripped apart.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising that we should wish to find the person responsible for this outrage and vent our fury upon him. It's no less surprising that the man who runs the company charged with maintaining the track should be identified as the culprit. But to blame Gerald Corbett would be to exonerate the real offenders. He has presented himself as a sacrifice, to atone for the multiple failures of our railways. We should reject it.</p> <p>If the crash was caused by a broken rail, then there can be little doubt that Railtrack is partly responsible. Two months ago the regulator informed the company that its failure to reduce the number of breakages appreciably was a breach of its licence. The health and safety executive had warned that \"the risk of derailment from a broken rail is likely to remain significant for some time to come.\"</p> <p>But whatever the immediate reasons for the crash might have been, the underlying causes predate Mr Corbett's appointment by decades. The Beeching cuts brought to an end not only a widely accessible railway system, but also a management ethic which, for a few years at least, placed public wellbeing ahead of competing private interests.

      "bodyText": "The 12.10 from London to Leeds passed the train on which I was travelling 10 minutes before it crashed. I think I recollect it, a flickering distraction from the papers I was reading on my way into King's Cross. I still haven't quite grasped the idea that while I was packing my bag and thinking about my lunch, the other train was being ripped apart. It's hardly surprising that we should wish to find the person responsible for this outrage and vent our fury upon him. It's no less surprising that the man who runs the company charged with maintaining the track should be identified as the culprit. But to blame Gerald Corbett would be to exonerate the real offenders. He has presented himself as a sacrifice, to atone for the multiple failures of our railways. We should reject it. If the crash was caused by a broken rail, then there can be little doubt that Railtrack is partly responsible. Two months ago the regulator informed the company that its failure to reduce the number of breakages appreciably was a breach of its licence. The health and safety executive had warned that \"the risk of derailment from a broken rail is likely to remain significant for some time to come.\" But whatever the immediate reasons for the crash might have been, the underlying causes predate Mr Corbett's appointment by decades. The Beeching cuts brought to an end not only a widely accessible railway system, but also a management ethic which, for a few years at least, placed public wellbeing ahead of competing private interests. The haste with which the railway lands were sold and the decision to dynamite some of the bridges - ensuring that the cuts could not be reversed - suggest that a reduction in public spending was not the government's only consideration. Years later, the Tories' motives for running down the railways also appeared to be mixed. When Mrs Thatcher announced that \"nothing can stop the great car economy\", she meant it. Just as the traffic light intervals on the old Winchester road were increased in order to make the case for a bypass through Twyford Down more compelling, just as the ferries to the Isle of Skye were allowed to fall apart in order to generate public pressure for a privately financed bridge, so Britain's railways were left to deteriorate to make their eventual privatisation seem more attractive. As the network fell apart, so our faith in public provision waned, and our participation in the great car economy - socially fragmented, non-unionised and lucratively unsustainable as it was - increased.

Every store was being as sessed, he said, and a handful will be closed down, but no more details will be available until the end of November, when the group announces its half-year results. Sainsbury is now moving fast to catch up the ground it has lost in recent years to Tesco. A range of 350 premium food items labelled Taste the Difference is about to be launched to rival Tesco's Finest range. At the same time, Sir Peter is beefing up the store's e-commerce home delivery service. While Tesco established a store-based system which now covers the bulk of the country, Sainsbury was left standing with grand plans for huge dedicated e-commerce depots. Yesterday Sir Peter said he would have 33 stores nationwide and two dedicated centres offering \"a hybrid service\" by next April. They will be able to service 60% of the country. Asked how long it would take to catch up with Tesco's internet shopping service, Sir Peter said: \"I don't want to get into that.\" He said that the transformation programme the group had embarked upon would deliver cost efficiencies of \u00a3600m a year and that profits and sales were meeting targets. There was no news on the future of Homebase, which is expected to be sold. The shares climbed 25.75p to 379p.",

      "body": "<p>The difference between a good and bad work of art is how long it detains us. When you walk into an art gallery there is no start or finish, no interval. You walk around, look at what takes your fancy, move on, stop, go away, come back. It's a cruel, casual blood sport. Piles of rubbish forming the silhouette of faces, or a photograph of the artist naked in a beach hut are nice ideas but essentially one-liners - you move on quickly. The simplest, most final way to dismiss a work of art is to say it does not reward serious attention. </p> <p>When you stand before great art, it seems impossible to look for too long. Caravaggio's Supper at Emmaus (1601) in the National Gallery has this effect on us. Caravaggio's painting is the document of a single moment, like a photograph, when two of Christ's disciples recognise their risen Lord. They register this realisation not in prayer, not by going down on their knees, but with the kind of stupid, stunned gestures that people might make seeing a goal on TV - pure physical shock. One disciple is pushing back his chair as if about to jump up and run outside. The other spreads his hands, dumbfounded. Only the waiter or host standing behind Christ looks dully, not realising what this moment is about. It is a split second of frozen action, but it contains infinities. In recognising the resurrected Christ, the disciples see that death is not an end, that human time has no meaning. The clock has stopped. </p> <p>Painting can make you feel all this, drag you out of time, yet it does it through material means, through technique. </p> <p>Telling Time, an exhibition that has just opened at the National Gallery, examines the ways in which painters since the Middle Ages have tried to mark the passing of time. It includes what is believed to be the first blurred image of a rotating wheel in art, in Nicolas Maes's Woman Spinning (c.1642). The exhibition also incorporates a fantastic machine, devised by scientists from the applied visual research unit at the Institute of Behavioural Sciences at Derby University, that tracks the movements of your eyes as you look at a painting. The National Gallery is conducting a sinister experiment on its visitors. You sit down and study an image of a painting in the collection on a screen. As you do so, your eye movements are monitored, and the information collated with other results to find out how far a painting determines the way we look at it. </p> <p>The results so far are not stunning. When people look at Albert Cuyp's The Maas at Dordrecht in a Storm (1645-50), a painting of sail boats being thrown about on a tempestuous sea off the Dutch shore, they look first and longest at the boats. When they contemplate Paul Delaroche's sentimental 19th-century history painting The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (1833), their eyes tend to be drawn to the central white-clad figure of the kneeling woman about to have her head cut off. </p> <p>The most interesting thing that the research has confirmed so far is that it is impossible to take in the whole of a painting at once. There is no such thing as a totalising gaze - the look that comprehends everything - because the nature of visual perception is momentary, partial and fragmentary. Our visual field is very small and precise. Look at someone's face and you are aware of their surroundings and dress only as blurred secondary information. When we contemplate a painting we are not looking equally at all parts at the same time (unless we move so far back that it becomes one small image). The National Gallery's eye-tracking machine demonstrates that we look at one small area of the canvas, then another, in short glances. Yet ultimately, we connect the dots to make sense of the painting, feel its total presence, in our mind. </p> <p>Telling Time is unsure if it wants to be scholarly or populist, but it is this most gimmicky aspect that raises the most interesting questions. How does the succession of glances that the eye-tracking machine records lead to the overwhelming effect of a painting like Caravaggio's Supper at Emmaus? When you look at a painting, your brain breaks it up into high spots and low spots, faces, fruit, chairs, shadows. Like a film camera wielded by a Soviet montage director, you take in the world (the real world as well as that of painting) in a series of glances. William Hogarth's paintings Before and After (1730-1) in Telling Time invite and celebrate this type of looking. Hogarth's two paintings of a young couple just before and just after sex are designed to be seen side by side, so your eyes move from one to the other, comparing sections of each picture, contrasting the woman's modest shying away from her lover's proposal Before with her flushed look After; the man's foppishly neat hair Before with his tousled locks After. Hogarth's materialist, low art revels in the fragmented looking documented by the eye-tracking machine. Art that enjoys and acknowledges the glancing way we see things is anti-spiritual, time-bound art. </p> <p>This brings us back to Caravaggio's Supper at Emmaus. Does this painting feel like something you could look at for ever simply because of the richness of glances that it provokes? A work of art that you can take in at a glance is, by definition, inadequate. It is in a glance that the two disciples have recognised the man who walked beside them, yet for us there are so many points of visual fascination: the open palm of a hand, another hand raised in blessing, the bowl of fruit dangerously poised on the edge of the table, the bread. It is a low, ordinary scene - a scene in an inn in 17th-century Italy where Caravaggio might have drunk with men like these. But the longer you study the painting, the more you become aware that each gesture, far from being random, is intimately connected to everything else in a symbolic tableau. The hand of Christ elicits the outstretched hands of the disciple in a way that instantaneously connects the Last Supper, the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. The longer you look, the more you read the painting as a whole rather than merely registering separate visual details. </p> <p>In the end, Caravaggio's painting is not about light hitting the eye in a series of moments. It is about the mind: it is intended to be read, interpreted. This is the difference between art we just walk past and art we could look at for ever. The eye-tracking machine demonstrates what happens when your eye moves across the surface of a painting. And what the banality of this information reveals is that in the end our relationship with art is not merely visual. After looking at The Supper at Emmaus, you surrender exhausted, go to the museum shop, buy a postcard, plan to come back and look again. You feel that you have failed - and perhaps that is the definition of a great work of art. It outfaces you. </p> <p>\u0095 Telling Time is at the National Gallery, London WC2 (020-7747 2885), till January 14.</p>",

His much-loved voice rings in my ears this week. </p> <p>The work itself is a private business, and nobody else is much interested in that. But the story behind The Guardsman's closure is already seeping out into the public domain and looks likely, unlike the show, to run and run. So: no witch-hunt, but some facts. </p> <p>The producer of the play is Paddy Wilson. His temporary landlords at the Albery are the Ambassadors Theatre Group. The critical reception for the show has been poor, but not that poor - the Times was good, the Guardian too to some extent, and there have been good television reviews. The word-of-mouth is good, and advance bookings have built healthily since the first performance on October 4. Under normal circumstances, the show could have looked forward to an honourable two or three month run. </p> <p>As it turns out, it never really had a chance. Before The Guardsman opened, plans appear to have been already advanced to bring The Mystery of Charles Dickens into the Albery early in November. During its last week on tour, The Guardsman company and staff were requested by Paddy Wilson to take a salary cut, which in the case of some of the principals amounted to 80% of their negotiated fees, although the advance was not bad for a new and unfamiliar play. The proposal was that the cast would return to their original salaries in week three of the London run, and be reimbursed what they had deferred for the first two weeks by the end of week six. The reality was that the sixth week was unlikely to be available to us; the third barely. Paddy Wilson assures me that he didn't know this. </p> <p>The company eventually agreed to the deferment. In this event, all it has really achieved is to reduce Paddy Wilson's costs on the show's demise. </p> <p>Without a rush on the box office, there seem to have been no refunds available to \"nurse\" the production through its critical first two weeks. Paddy Wilson attributes the problem to the loss of an investor halfway through the pre-London tour (a loss that Lady Bracknell might have described as \"careless\"); I am not convinced that the show's investment base was secure from the start. To me, there were signs of under-resource and false economies even then; and Equity, who require a deposit equivalent to two weeks' actors' salaries at the beginning of such a project, didn't get it until just before the West End opening. </p> <p>The relationship between a producer and a theatre owner is a complicated one; Ambassadors Theatre Group had hesitations about the show's \"legs\" in any case. Suppose they had doubts about receiving their due rents from the producer as well, and you can well see that they might begin to make other arrangements for the Albery and to see the Guardsman as a brief \"filler\". </p> <p>Still, a show which clearly had limited but still honourable expectations in the West End has sunk almost without trace. As I write, some of those associated with the production are still owed money, quite apart from the pay deferment. All are embarrassed to be the last to hear what much of London seemed to know. Producers are a hardy and courageous lot in a high-risk business, and theatre-owners need to keep their lights on, but it can be difficult to judge how unlucky a producer has to be before he is to blame. For a hard-working cast and staff, it can be difficult, too, to detect the fault-lines beneath, let alone know what to do about them. For both parties, as Giuelgud said, failure can be fascinating.

To me, there were signs of under-resource and false economies even then; and Equity, who require a deposit equivalent to two weeks' actors' salaries at the beginning of such a project, didn't get it until just before the West End opening. The relationship between a producer and a theatre owner is a complicated one; Ambassadors Theatre Group had hesitations about the show's \"legs\" in any case. Suppose they had doubts about receiving their due rents from the producer as well, and you can well see that they might begin to make other arrangements for the Albery and to see the Guardsman as a brief \"filler\". Still, a show which clearly had limited but still honourable expectations in the West End has sunk almost without trace. As I write, some of those associated with the production are still owed money, quite apart from the pay deferment. All are embarrassed to be the last to hear what much of London seemed to know. Producers are a hardy and courageous lot in a high-risk business, and theatre-owners need to keep their lights on, but it can be difficult to judge how unlucky a producer has to be before he is to blame. For a hard-working cast and staff, it can be difficult, too, to detect the fault-lines beneath, let alone know what to do about them. For both parties, as Giuelgud said, failure can be fascinating.

      "body": "<p>Among the many words uttered in eulogy for Donald Dewar in Glasgow cathedral yesterday few, if any, were indelicate enough to suggest that Scotland's first first minister in 300 years was lucky in the manner and timing of his death. Such talk is too soon for those who mourn him most.</p> <p>Yet in the longer perspective it is true. Donald Dewar was a rare politician in all the ways that people wrote and talked about last week, including many who had been abusing him only days earlier. But to die quickly - surrounded by affection - after being instrumental in bringing one's lifetime ambition to fruition is not a fate given to most of us, let alone to the restless souls of politicians.</p> <p>Contrast the man they buried yesterday with his great friend, John Smith. The contrast is a cruel one. Smith, like Hugh Gaitskell to an earlier Labour generation, remains a might-have-been leader, struck down in 1994 - mercifully quickly, which is better than the long decline which beset such people as Harold Wilson.</p> <p>But it happened before he had the chance to lead Labour to victory in 1997. A smaller victory than Tony Blair's perhaps, but who knows whether it would have been a smaller government.</p> <p>No such ill luck for Donald. Devolution may go belly-up from now on, one way or another. It may prove a shining success, as even the Scottish Nationalists under John Swinney quietly embrace the Catalan model (lip service to independence and maximalist autonomy within the Spanish state).</p> <p>Either way, Dewar's place in his country's history and affections is likely to remain secure long after the hospitals and schools named after him have crumbled. It will not be his fault.</p> <p>Things do not work that way for most politicians. The mordant Enoch Powell once wrote that \"all political careers end in failure.\" He was thinking of his hero, Joseph Chamberlain, who walked out of Gladstone's Liberal government over Irish home rule, then wrecked the Tory party too over \"imperial free trade\" but - like Powell himself - lived long enough to see most of his destructive genius brought to nought.</p> <p>That is the general rule. Churchill said in 1940: \"I did not become his majesty's chief minister in order to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire.\" But of course he did. It is true that not a square foot of territory was decolonised in Churchill's second term (1951-55), but India had already gone under Labour (1947) and by his death in 1965 the bankruptcy sale was almost over.</p> <p>In his 10-year retirement Churchill, so his doctor later wrote, had longed to die, but couldn't. At least he resigned office just in time. Among his contemporaries Tito of Yugoslavia, Franco of Spain and Charles de Gaulle all hung on both to life and office. For each it ended in tears - tears are still being shed in Belgrade.</p> <p>FDR, by way of contrast, died, exhausted, a few days before Hitler in April 1945, with victory all but assured. He is with the immortals. Jack Kennedy, a somewhat lesser figure, is too, simply by virtue of a premature martyr's death, grace and style wantonly destroyed - just like Jimmies Dean and Hendrix (but not Elvis), like John (but not Yoko). And like Princess Di.</p> <p>Old age need not be a burden to the great and good. In our own time both Ted Heath, Conservative prime minister from 1970-74, and Labour's Jim Callaghan show every sign of having embraced greater serenity in old age than in office. Unlike Heath, Callaghan has rarely uttered a word of criticism against his successors. But Sir Edward, now 84, has gamely hung on in the Commons (he will surely retire next time) and seen off the woman who blighted his career.

      "bodyText": "Among the many words uttered in eulogy for Donald Dewar in Glasgow cathedral yesterday few, if any, were indelicate enough to suggest that Scotland's first first minister in 300 years was lucky in the manner and timing of his death. Such talk is too soon for those who mourn him most. Yet in the longer perspective it is true. Donald Dewar was a rare politician in all the ways that people wrote and talked about last week, including many who had been abusing him only days earlier. But to die quickly - surrounded by affection - after being instrumental in bringing one's lifetime ambition to fruition is not a fate given to most of us, let alone to the restless souls of politicians. Contrast the man they buried yesterday with his great friend, John Smith. The contrast is a cruel one. Smith, like Hugh Gaitskell to an earlier Labour generation, remains a might-have-been leader, struck down in 1994 - mercifully quickly, which is better than the long decline which beset such people as Harold Wilson. But it happened before he had the chance to lead Labour to victory in 1997. A smaller victory than Tony Blair's perhaps, but who knows whether it would have been a smaller government. No such ill luck for Donald. Devolution may go belly-up from now on, one way or another. It may prove a shining success, as even the Scottish Nationalists under John Swinney quietly embrace the Catalan model (lip service to independence and maximalist autonomy within the Spanish state). Either way, Dewar's place in his country's history and affections is likely to remain secure long after the hospitals and schools named after him have crumbled. It will not be his fault. Things do not work that way for most politicians. The mordant Enoch Powell once wrote that \"all political careers end in failure.\" He was thinking of his hero, Joseph Chamberlain, who walked out of Gladstone's Liberal government over Irish home rule, then wrecked the Tory party too over \"imperial free trade\" but - like Powell himself - lived long enough to see most of his destructive genius brought to nought. That is the general rule. Churchill said in 1940: \"I did not become his majesty's chief minister in order to preside over the dissolution of the British Empire.\" But of course he did. It is true that not a square foot of territory was decolonised in Churchill's second term (1951-55), but India had already gone under Labour (1947) and by his death in 1965 the bankruptcy sale was almost over. In his 10-year retirement Churchill, so his doctor later wrote, had longed to die, but couldn't. At least he resigned office just in time. Among his contemporaries Tito of Yugoslavia, Franco of Spain and Charles de Gaulle all hung on both to life and office. For each it ended in tears - tears are still being shed in Belgrade. FDR, by way of contrast, died, exhausted, a few days before Hitler in April 1945, with victory all but assured. He is with the immortals. Jack Kennedy, a somewhat lesser figure, is too, simply by virtue of a premature martyr's death, grace and style wantonly destroyed - just like Jimmies Dean and Hendrix (but not Elvis), like John (but not Yoko). And like Princess Di. Old age need not be a burden to the great and good. In our own time both Ted Heath, Conservative prime minister from 1970-74, and Labour's Jim Callaghan show every sign of having embraced greater serenity in old age than in office. Unlike Heath, Callaghan has rarely uttered a word of criticism against his successors. But Sir Edward, now 84, has gamely hung on in the Commons (he will surely retire next time) and seen off the woman who blighted his career. He may even be vindicated on Europe in his lifetime. Barbara Castle, 90 this month, has stayed magnificently on the ball: a policy player. But Lady Thatcher ... oh dear. Just as it is wholly predictable that amiable John Major will enjoy his retirement, so it was equally certain the day she shed that tear as she left Downing Street in November 1990 that the years ahead would be like Norma Desmond's in Sunset Boulevard. Mr Major's political body may be floating facedown in her swimming pool (will Hague's too?) but her frantic spirit seems to find little peace. I'm still big, she tells adoring paying audiences in Japan or America, it's the movies that got small.

Mr Bush, he claimed, was the candidate of big business, who would squander American economic strength by giving large tax cuts to the richest. In a moment that will doubtless be replayed many times in Gore campaign ads, the vice-president challenged Mr Bush to deny that his plan for tax cuts favours the wealthiest 1% of Americans. \"Of course it does,\" Mr Bush responded. \"If you pay the taxes, why shouldn't you get the benefit.\" In return, Mr Bush pointed to his Democrat opponent, saying: \"This is a big spender.\" He accused Mr Gore of \"proposing the largest increase in federal spending in years\", and depicted himself as a fresh outsider untainted by Washington politics. \"I don't like it when the federal government tells us what to do,\" Mr Bush said. One of the earliest clashes of the evening was also one of the most emblematic, with Mr Gore saying there was \"strong disagreement\" between the two men on health care insur ance and forcing Mr Bush on to the defensive about his record on the issue in Texas. Under pressure, Mr Bush claimed he had \"pushed through\" a patients' bill of rights as Texas governor. In fact, Mr Bush first vetoed and then refused to sign legislation giving patients the right to sue their health insurance organisations - a distortion which Mr Gore called \"unacceptable\". \"Here we go again,\" Mr Gore said after Bush had pledged action against the high cost of prescription drugs for the elderly. \"If you want someone who will spin a lot of words ... and then end up supporting legislation that is supported by the big drug companies, this is your man.\"",

Researchers have found images painted some 35,000 years ago - almost certainly the world's oldest cave paintings and possibly man's first artistic creations - in a hill near the north-eastern Italian city of Verona. The images, presented at a press conference in the city yesterday, were painted in red ochre on rock and represent an animal with an elongated neck (possibly a weasel), a mysterious five-legged animal and a man - thought to be a wizard - wearing a mask with horns. They were found last year on fragments of rock from the walls of the Fumane Cave in the Lessini Hills, north of Verona. \"They are probably the oldest cave paintings, although we cannot affirm that with scientific certainty,\" said Professor Alberto Broglio, who teaches palaeontology at the university of Ferrara and coordinated the excavation.

Dr Alessandra Astes, director of the Natural History Museum in Verona, said scientists were able to date the paintings, which measure between one and two feet long, through carbon dating and archaeological stratographic techniques, because the rocks had become detached from the cave wall and were buried under later generations of debris. The figure of the man in the horned mask and with his arms outstretched was extremely rare in early cave paintings, said Dr Astes. \"The find is of enormous scientific significance, which goes far beyond its artistic or stylistic value,\" she said. \"The find is of exceptional value.

For researchers, who are still excavating the Fumane Cave, the discovery is a crucial link in the history of human life on Earth as well as a first glimpse of the creative instinct that inspired Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo in a later age.

Admittedly they always appear for the defence, but they didn't win a single case in the first episode of <strong> North Square </strong> (Channel 4). Neither the man who stole Y-fronts from washing lines, nor the pathetic, pregnant shoplifter, nor the quite-nice-really murderer. And God knows what happened to the schizophrenic they abandoned to her fate in Liverpool when they all decamped to Leeds to have a baby. Still, plenty of people you'd cross the road at a run to avoid make excellent viewing. And so do these. </p> <p>North Square by Peter Moffat is a 10-part drama series full of energy and edge, which can look any similar American effort in the eye. </p> <p>These barristers are young, good-looking, clever, ruthless. They don't exactly enter. The doors burst open and they blow in. \"What's the jury like?\" \"Four Daily Telegraphs, three moustaches, one blazer, two blue rinses and a Mormon in the front row.\" \"It's not a jury at all, Alex, it's a coffee morning.\" \"A jury of Rich Tea dunkers.\" \"Bloody bastard custard cream lickers.\" \"Steady, Billy.\" You will - for you are quick like that - have deduced that these are Alex and Billy, that they are about to go down in flames like fighter pilots, that Billy is the more incendiary of the two (he has a bet on the outcome of the case) and that the jury is one short. </p> <p>It's a strenuous series, and you have to run to keep up, but there are cases to suit all tastes. </p> <p>The vagaries of the clerk (a role just munched alive by Phil Davis) mean that innocent Morag, fresh from Mull, finds herself defending a murderer in Portia-like rhythms (\"Bail is an entitlement. You don't give it. You have to take it away\"), while the experienced Billy has to try to defend a man with a moral compulsion to wipe out Y-fronts (\"My client wants to tell you very sincerely that he is not sorry for what he has done.\") </p> <p>The murderer and the sworn foe of Y-fronts have the look of men who have collided with life face-first. They are sharing the same police cell with, for the moment, Billy, who is taking his client's instructions. \"It's not just underpants. It's Y-fronts.

      "bodyText": "I wouldn't use any of these barristers myself. Admittedly they always appear for the defence, but they didn't win a single case in the first episode of North Square (Channel 4). Neither the man who stole Y-fronts from washing lines, nor the pathetic, pregnant shoplifter, nor the quite-nice-really murderer. And God knows what happened to the schizophrenic they abandoned to her fate in Liverpool when they all decamped to Leeds to have a baby. Still, plenty of people you'd cross the road at a run to avoid make excellent viewing. And so do these. North Square by Peter Moffat is a 10-part drama series full of energy and edge, which can look any similar American effort in the eye. These barristers are young, good-looking, clever, ruthless. They don't exactly enter. The doors burst open and they blow in. \"What's the jury like?\" \"Four Daily Telegraphs, three moustaches, one blazer, two blue rinses and a Mormon in the front row.\" \"It's not a jury at all, Alex, it's a coffee morning.\" \"A jury of Rich Tea dunkers.\" \"Bloody bastard custard cream lickers.\" \"Steady, Billy.\" You will - for you are quick like that - have deduced that these are Alex and Billy, that they are about to go down in flames like fighter pilots, that Billy is the more incendiary of the two (he has a bet on the outcome of the case) and that the jury is one short. It's a strenuous series, and you have to run to keep up, but there are cases to suit all tastes. The vagaries of the clerk (a role just munched alive by Phil Davis) mean that innocent Morag, fresh from Mull, finds herself defending a murderer in Portia-like rhythms (\"Bail is an entitlement. You don't give it. You have to take it away\"), while the experienced Billy has to try to defend a man with a moral compulsion to wipe out Y-fronts (\"My client wants to tell you very sincerely that he is not sorry for what he has done.\") The murderer and the sworn foe of Y-fronts have the look of men who have collided with life face-first. They are sharing the same police cell with, for the moment, Billy, who is taking his client's instructions. \"It's not just underpants. It's Y-fronts. I think they are repugnant, oppressive and a violence to the eye. I consider it my duty to remove them.\" \"What, Mr Burns, given these circumstances, do you think your defence might be?\" \"It was very well put at Nuremberg. There are certain laws which it is the moral duty of every citizen to break. I'm sure you will agree, Mr Guthrie, that morality and law are not the same thing.\" \"Some people like Y- fronts. It's their entitlement\", objected Billy. \"Keats is not better than Bob Dylan\", said Burns obscurely. At this point the murderer, Frank \"Mad Bastard\" Green, justified his name by thrusting a face like a clenched fist at them and shouting \"Fucking fuck off can't you, you pair of pricks?\" While deploring the increasing use of obscenity in police cells and all that, I howled like a timber wolf. For this effect you have to credit virtually everyone - the writer, the actors, the director and the mothers who bore them.

This didn't last and it wasn't long before the pork was dropped and baked beans as we know them were born. A sad day indeed - baked beans in tomato with pork belly is a meal which, even more than bacon sarnies, would severely dent a vegetarian's principles. </p> <p> Ron Graves, Birkenhead, Merseyside. </p> <p> <b> Why are teeth thought worthy of a separate medical profession, when all other parts of the body are looked after by specialist doctors?</b> </p> <p>\u0095 Apart from dentists, there are other \"paramedical\" professions, for example clinical psychologists (as distinct from psychiatrists, who are medical specialists), child psychotherapists and chiropodists. In the US and Holland, dentists must take a full medical degree. If this is wasteful, so must be our requirement of (say) eye surgeons or psychiatrists. There is a need for an abbreviated medical curriculum, restricted to the shared needs of all specialists. </p> <p> Richard Benjamin, London N11. </p> <p>\u0095 Having worked in many doctors' mouths, I am convinced they have little personal understanding of this part of their own body. </p> <p> Tim Cudmore, Windhoek, Namibia. </p> <p>\u0095Podiatriasts (aka chiropodists) are directly analogous to dentists in that they are not medically qualified and have a history going back around 1,000 years. The roots of profession date from \"corn pickers\" in the streets of medieval England. Podiatry education is now delivered all over the western world in honours degree courses. </p> <p> Dr Robert Kidd, Head of Podiatry, University of Western Sydney, Australia. </p> <p>\u0095 Only dentists can fill that gap. </p> <p> Judy McClelland, Waalre, The Netherlands. </p> <p><b> Monocles seemed to be popular in Victorian and Edwardian times. Why, rather than spectacles?</b> </p> <p>\u0095 Because Victorians and Edwardians had an eye for style. </p> <p> David Prothero, Harpenden, Herts. </p> <p>\u0095 I read this question in fading light with the aid of my monocle, which has been my constant companion for some 10 years. The reason? My eyesight is excellent but, with increasing age, like most contemporaries, a little help is occasionally needed for one eye but not the other. So why inflict spectacles on both eyes? Every morning the monocle is hung round my neck and remains there until bedtime. It is inconspicuous when not in use, I can't damage it, I can't break it - above all, I can't lose it. It is comfortable, convenient and cheaper. A problem may, I suppose, arise should the other eye need support; meanwhile why use spectacles? I do have a pair, admittedly. Now where did I last see them? </p> <p>\u0095 A T Wiseman, Cobham, Surrey. </p> <p> <b> When I listen to vinyl on a new, high-quality record deck, the sound produced seems to be warmer, more three-dimensional, and offering greater definition and far superior \"naturalness\" of sound than produced by a compact disc. Am I imagining this? If not, what are the reasons?</b> </p> <p>\u0095 There are a number of factors affecting the sound you hear, from the speakers right down to the cabling the signal travels down. Depending on the quality of the hi-fi system, all components and electronics (including those in the CD player) will \"colour\" the sound to some degree. A top-end system should have minimal colouration. </p> <p>There will always be an element of distortion on a vinyl pressing, which can be perceived as \"warmth\". Also, the upper frequency limit of a CD is 20KHz, whereas a vinyl pressing can reproduce significantly higher frequencies. A complex sound, as opposed to a single-frequency tone, has, in addition to the fundamental frequency, overtones or upper harmonics which determine the timbre of the sound you hear, even though many of those overtones/harmonics are above the range of the human ear. </p> <p>On a vinyl record, as opposed to a CD, those harmonics are retained, enabling a more accurate sound to be reproduced, although this would not be noticeable on a more modest hi-fi system, which would not pass on those frequencies. </p> <p>Further, a vinyl record is analogue. A CD is digital, which means that the sound, which starts as analogue, has to be digitally coded by \"sampling\" it 44,000 times a second (chopping it up into millions of little sound snapshots, the audio equivalent of the way a film or television picture is actually lots of still pictures seen one after the other to create the effect of movement). It then has to be decoded back into an analogue signal so you can hear it. It may be the sampling that causes you to perceive the CD as less natural. </p> <p>It is worth bearing in mind that these days many master tapes are digital and have already lost the higher frequencies before the transition to vinyl, so all you will get from the vinyl is some extra distortion and colouration. </p> <p>\u0095 The common observation that music on CDs sounds \"colder\" than on vinyl is partly due to the chilling realisation that you've just spent 15 quid on a recording you already own. It can be countered by the \"warm glow\" many people report while downloading music free off Napster. </p> <p> Dave Green, London NW6. </p> <p> <b> Why does the Bank of Ireland issue sterling notes? Do other Irish banks do it?</b></p> <p>\u0095 Most Irish Republic banks have branches in Northern Ireland and therefore have to issue sterling, as you would have difficulty in spending punts in a corner shop in Belfast. At the same time, Northern Irish banks which have branches in the Irish Republic issue the punt as their main currency. Until the punt broke away from sterling it was possible to use both currencies throughout the whole of Ireland, even in mixed styles of currency. It is still possible to do so but mainly only in border areas. As for spending Irish-issued sterling in Britain, take your chance but expect a quizzical look, a refusal and a trip to the bank to change to \"proper money\".

Lynda Chalker, the transport minister, asked what, if anything, could be done, and agreed to consider my suggestion of private access roads between the base and the M4.

Under his close supervision even escapist movies such as Die Goldene Stadt or Die Grosse Liebe had to glorify German actions and endorse - often very subtly - National Socialist ideals.

Its reviews are the main way I can find out about new and obscure bands without making a series of costly and unfortunate experiments. If those music critics didn't exist I would probably have given up on music by now. Louise Wright, Epsom, Surrey. \u0095 What a terrible question! Chris Poole, Talaton, Exeter. Any answers? Since musicians never stop composing, will there ever be a time when it is impossible to produce an original tune? Janet Pascoe, Ickenham, Middx. I am very quick with everything except love and calculations. Might there be any connection? Sonja Harms, London SE23. Who lost so much skin off their nose that it still worries us when agreeing to a favour? Marcus Rutland, Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I saw a rainbow earlier this year - perfect in every way except that it was upside-down. Both \"ends\" pointed up into the sky. Can this be explained ? Lee Sargent, London N15 How can clouds retain their shape even in the windiest conditions? Tom Gardner, London NW2.",

I would be failing as the head of Soul II Soul if I wasn't down with the family.\" </p> <p>Birthdays aside, the Soul II Soul headquarters, in a converted garage in Camden, north London, is buzzing as the press come and go. It's just like old times when Soul II Soul was the hottest name in the British charts, except that this time it's not Jazzie the journalists are looking for, but one of his proteges, a 28-year-old called Jason Chue, or Wookie. The fervour is remarkably similar to 1989, when Soul II Soul reinvented the rasta look as \"funki-dred\" and launched an authentic black British sound while they were about it. Wookie, the first act to be signed by the Soul II Soul label, is being heralded as one of the pioneers of the UK garage/two-step sound. </p> <p>We've been here before, of course. A \"unique black British sound\" seems to surface every few years. In the early 1980s it was the brash jazz-funk of bands such as Light of the World; later it was Soul II Soul. In the 1990s it was drum'n'bass and speed garage. Always lurking in the background is the festering resentment of R&amp;B music and American culture. </p> <p>The odd thing about Wookie is that he is being feted as one of the prime movers of a scene to which he doesn't really belong. His debut album is not strictly UK garage but a gospel/ garage hybrid. The beats are slower, there are proper song structures, and the lyrics about life, new babies and the all-round hassle of existence are likely to send you from the dance floor in furrowed contemplation. </p> <p>\"Some roughnecks nicked our beautiful Soul II Soul insignia off the front of the building, so we must be in demand again,\" says Jazzie, clearly happy that his new signing has livened the place up. \"Wookie's a deep guy. He's not going to chat about any old crap. Like Soul II Soul, he's got something to say. I just want to make sure he doesn't make the mistakes I did. These days he doesn't even get to go home. He comes from the studio back to my gaff to eat and I'll sit there boring the arse off him going, 'When we got the Grammy I went and did this or should have said that.' \" </p> <p>Jazzie still grouses that he won Grammys in the US but never a Brit award over here. \"Fuck 'em,\" he says. \"You can't argue with hit records. People used to say, 'Jazzie, you're just a fucking DJ', but we showed 'em. Who cares about the Brits anyway? The rest of the world sat up and took notice. Neneh Cherry won one and she broke it and gave half to us.\" </p> <p>The rancour belies a new serenity in Jazzie's life. He is trim and fit and, despite grey flecks in his locks, claims to be 36. He likes being in the background, pulling the strings. His mother Blanche's death in February has put business into perspective. Even so, you get the feeling that the spirit of the cheesy ol' Soul II Soul mantra, \"A smiling face, a thumping bass for a loving race\", isn't always observed, especially when he and his disciple have a difference of opinion. </p> <p>\"A smiling face gets you so far,\" says Jazzie. \"But I'm not against kicking someone down the stairs when they start fucking about. Wookie's been there. He knows the score. We're a family here and we've had our fights. He's come through that. He knows he's been close to dismissal in the past. But he showed he had something extra to turn it around. The man's got what it takes, but there was a time when he was nearly out on his arse.\" </p> <p>Downstairs the garage pioneer who nearly wasn't receives guests in his own small studio. A double platinum disc hangs on the wall. \"I'll catch up,\" says Wookie. \"I got a few years on him, haven't I?\" In his den there is a guitar and bass bearing \"Condemned\" stickers. \"They don't work,\" he says. \"But you don't need any of that stuff now. I do everything on computer and keyboard.\" </p> <p>Wookie's musical odyssey couldn't have been more different from his boss's. Jazzie grew up as part of the sound-system underground - mobile discos with huge speakers and an attendant \"crew\" who also customise records by MCing over the top. This still supplies the reggae world with MCs and producers. Though Wookie's father and brother are also immersed in this world, his musical epiphany occurred when he was laid off as a trainee architect during the recession of the early 1990s. He started to mess around with a cheap keyboard, which still sits in his studio today. He didn't even know who Soul II Soul were when he was 17, he says with a laugh. </p> <p>One of his first steps in the business was writing a crass R Kelly pastiche called G Spot for Wayne Marshall in 1994. After he co-wrote half of Marshall's album, they fell out and Wookie went his own way. He passed a tape to Jazzie through the barber they shared, and was signed to Jazzie's production company as an in-house producer. Crucially, Jazzie allowed him to lurk on the payroll finding his feet before pushing him. \"I was writing slow ballads,\" says Wookie. \"Jazzie would come in and say, 'What am I going to do with ballads? I don't do ballads, for fuck's sake!' There's a vault with hundreds of my discarded ballads in there. But he gave me time to learn and make mistakes, which was a godsend.\" </p> <p>Wookie comes across as a bashful, level-headed chap. But that doesn't mean he gets trampled by the voluble, charismatic Jazzie. \"People can be overwhelmed by that Jazzie aura,\" says Wookie. \"But I'm stubborn as hell. In a way we should be at each other's throats, but I think that's why he likes me.\" </p> <p>Next year they'll go head-to-head in the charts. A new Soul II Soul album and a tour vying for attention with Wookie's solo career launch: who will win? They claim they both will. \"I look over his schedule some days,\" says Jazzie. \"An interview, a video shoot, a flight here, a flight there. I think, I wouldn't go near that with a barge pole. But I like the idea that he's keeping this place alive. I like the idea that Soul II Soul won't be another black music enterprise that came and went and was forgotten. Yeah, looking at it that way, I'm glad I never sacked him.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The album Wookie is out on the Soul II Soul label on October 30.</p>",

A double platinum disc hangs on the wall. \"I'll catch up,\" says Wookie. \"I got a few years on him, haven't I?\" In his den there is a guitar and bass bearing \"Condemned\" stickers. \"They don't work,\" he says. \"But you don't need any of that stuff now. I do everything on computer and keyboard.\" Wookie's musical odyssey couldn't have been more different from his boss's. Jazzie grew up as part of the sound-system underground - mobile discos with huge speakers and an attendant \"crew\" who also customise records by MCing over the top. This still supplies the reggae world with MCs and producers. Though Wookie's father and brother are also immersed in this world, his musical epiphany occurred when he was laid off as a trainee architect during the recession of the early 1990s. He started to mess around with a cheap keyboard, which still sits in his studio today. He didn't even know who Soul II Soul were when he was 17, he says with a laugh. One of his first steps in the business was writing a crass R Kelly pastiche called G Spot for Wayne Marshall in 1994. After he co-wrote half of Marshall's album, they fell out and Wookie went his own way. He passed a tape to Jazzie through the barber they shared, and was signed to Jazzie's production company as an in-house producer. Crucially, Jazzie allowed him to lurk on the payroll finding his feet before pushing him. \"I was writing slow ballads,\" says Wookie. \"Jazzie would come in and say, 'What am I going to do with ballads? I don't do ballads, for fuck's sake!' There's a vault with hundreds of my discarded ballads in there. But he gave me time to learn and make mistakes, which was a godsend.\" Wookie comes across as a bashful, level-headed chap. But that doesn't mean he gets trampled by the voluble, charismatic Jazzie. \"People can be overwhelmed by that Jazzie aura,\" says Wookie. \"But I'm stubborn as hell. In a way we should be at each other's throats, but I think that's why he likes me.\" Next year they'll go head-to-head in the charts. A new Soul II Soul album and a tour vying for attention with Wookie's solo career launch: who will win? They claim they both will. \"I look over his schedule some days,\" says Jazzie. \"An interview, a video shoot, a flight here, a flight there. I think, I wouldn't go near that with a barge pole. But I like the idea that he's keeping this place alive. I like the idea that Soul II Soul won't be another black music enterprise that came and went and was forgotten. Yeah, looking at it that way, I'm glad I never sacked him.\" \u0095 The album Wookie is out on the Soul II Soul label on October 30.",

Born in Manchester, by the time he was 26 he had become a self-made millionaire as the owner of a Latvian tobacco factory, was then a spy in Moscow at the outbreak of war, before becoming one half of a remarkable cloak-and-dagger romance.</p> <p>He was the son of a Greek immigrant father and a mother of Irish extraction. At 16, he took up the offer of a family friend in Riga to become a clerk at his tobacco factory. Following a dispute over the ownership of the factory in 1931, John took it over, built it up and within three years had become exceedingly rich. However, when, in 1937, the Latvian government nationalised the factory, he lost everything.</p> <p>Undeterred, he started a successful import-export business in Finland. The Russian invasion of 1939 put a stop to this and John escaped to Norway, only to have to flee from there after the German occupation.</p> <p>Back in Riga, now occupied by the Soviets, he was asked to join the British embassy in Moscow. However, before he could leave, the Russian secret police (NKVD) suspected there was more to John's role, accused him of being a German spy and threatened to kill him. For months he spent each night watching the front door, gun in hand. Finally, with the British anxious about his whereabouts, he was rescued by an envoy sent by the British ambassador, Sir Stafford Cripps.</p> <p>It was in Moscow that this mild-mannered Englishman began a romance with a Russian spy called Nora Korzhenko. Blackmailed into becoming a mozhno - a \"sex for secrets\" spy - with the code name Swallow, her first assignment was John, whom the NKVD had correctly surmised was not merely a clerk, but involved in espionage work and an operator of the code-scrambler, Hush - the heart of the secret Allied communications in Russia.</p> <p>Luckily for John, Nora was an unsophisticated spy. Rejected by him at every turn, she finally broke down and blurted out her story. Faced with the responsibility of sending her back to the NKVD empty-handed, John decided to adopt a high-risk strategy. He agreed to meet Nora regularly for \"Russian lessons\", where they concocted stories for her to relate to the NKVD. Nora's bosses finally discovered they were being duped and turned on her, revoking her citizenship. In desperation, she reached out to John. With loyalties now torn between his growing love for Nora and his role at the embassy, John was forced to make a near-impossible decision. He handed her the key to his flat at the British embassy. So long as she remained there she would be safe.</p> <p>The Russians were furious. However, Sir Stafford Cripps gave Nora refugee status and she was permitted to stay. By now John and Nora were very much in love. But by 1941, the German army had almost reached Moscow. The British embassy was hastily evacuated and John ordered to the Arctic base of Archangel, leaving Nora behind. On arrival, he was shocked to find that, as a security risk, he was to be sent back to England. In despair, he phoned Nora to share the news.</p> <p>With faked American documents, Nora escaped from a besieged Moscow, evaded NKVD agents in a 700-mile chase, and reached Archangel - only to discover that John's ship had already sailed, with him a prisoner. In fact, a raging blizzard had forced the ship to anchor a few miles up the coast. By now the temperature had dropped to minus 40C, yet Nora stumbled on through the night.</p> <p>As in the best romances, John just happened to be on deck, and caught sight of a figure staggering towards the ship's jetty out of the snowy wastes. It was Nora. Once safely on board, John proposed.</p> <p>But they still faced another hurdle: it was illegal for any Soviet citizen to leave the country and the captain was under strict orders to take John to Britain. He decided their only chance was to send a telegram to Stalin in the wild hope that he would take pity on them. But even as the message was being sent, Nora was kidnapped by the NKVD and hauled back to Moscow.</p> <p>No one is quite sure why Stalin read John's telegram - even less why he responded. John believed it was because they appealed to the dictator's ego. More likely they were used by Stalin as a bargaining tool, to support his claim to his western allies that things in the Soviet Union were beginning to thaw.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, John and Nora were allowed to leave the country in the spring of 1942, and John returned to England with his young Russian bride. The day after their departure, Stalin annulled the decree. Thus, Nora became the only Russian war-bride to escape the USSR during the second world war.</p> <p>When they got back to England, life was not easy. John was ostracised by the British establishment after his experiences in Russia, although he always claimed he never once betrayed his country. He started a business with a revolutionary new printing process that would enable newspapers to be printed in colour.

Under the weight of John's business failure and Nora's celebrity they finally separated in 1958, and John brought up his three sons alone.</p> <p>In 1978, after studying history as a mature student in Nottingham, John wrote his story, A Spy Called Swallow.

      "body": "<p>Debating is supposed to be something the British are good at. Our apparent verbal facility, combined with much practice put in at university, produces politicians so talented in the art of argument that Americans, in particular, can only gawp at their brilliance. This is presumably the myth that lies behind the success of prime minister's question time as an upmarket soap opera on coast-to-coast cable television. How long can it survive the fact that real debate is virtually dead as a British political performance? Along with oratory, debate is drowning in a sea of soundbites. At election time, debates between the aspiring leaders take place in Australia and Canada, in Germany, New Zealand, Holland, Sweden and other advanced democracies. But never in Britain.</p> <p>The final presidential debate between George Bush and Al Gore, which finished in the early hours yesterday morning, proved that this form of encounter is now the only one that gives the voters the chance to make a proper reckoning. It has become vastly better than any other. For 90 minutes, interested viewers were relieved of the politics of insults, of gobbets, of crude commercials, of tiny squirts of lies, which are the currency that prevails where such debates do not take place. Instead, the candidates spread themselves in front of us, discussed complex problems, developed reasoned arguments and exposed, for the third and perhaps defining time, the very different personalities they would bring to the most influential job in the world.</p> <p>The occasion was not without artifice. Each man had spent hours training in the ring with their handlers. But by the time of this debate, after the feints and falsities of the first two, each seemed reduced, or refined, to an essence that could not be disguised. Gore was informed, passionate, combative, making an insistent case for what government could do. Bush was human, anxious, brief-laden, and determined to excoriate Washington at every turn. They civilly loathe each other. While both gave their own versions of the truth about health, education, national security and the rest, the rules of challenge and response produced a dialogue that could at times almost be termed Socratic.</p> <p>In Britain, land of debate, this has never been allowed. Originally the resistance of politicians grew out of their disdain for television: until 1959, elections were not reported by TV at all. But there were no leader debates for the next 40 years because successive leaders didn't want them. Sometimes they got close. Invariably, though, the strongest placed candidate has ducked away, or else both the big ones have sheltered behind pretended concern about what to do with the Liberal Democrat.</p> <p>But it is now so obvious that televised debate surpasses any other mode of voter education that these objections must be seen for what they are: ruses which put supposed party advantage far above the public interest. Politicians worry about voters' mistrust of their trade, and alienation from the process.

      "bodyText": "Debating is supposed to be something the British are good at. Our apparent verbal facility, combined with much practice put in at university, produces politicians so talented in the art of argument that Americans, in particular, can only gawp at their brilliance. This is presumably the myth that lies behind the success of prime minister's question time as an upmarket soap opera on coast-to-coast cable television. How long can it survive the fact that real debate is virtually dead as a British political performance? Along with oratory, debate is drowning in a sea of soundbites. At election time, debates between the aspiring leaders take place in Australia and Canada, in Germany, New Zealand, Holland, Sweden and other advanced democracies. But never in Britain. The final presidential debate between George Bush and Al Gore, which finished in the early hours yesterday morning, proved that this form of encounter is now the only one that gives the voters the chance to make a proper reckoning. It has become vastly better than any other. For 90 minutes, interested viewers were relieved of the politics of insults, of gobbets, of crude commercials, of tiny squirts of lies, which are the currency that prevails where such debates do not take place. Instead, the candidates spread themselves in front of us, discussed complex problems, developed reasoned arguments and exposed, for the third and perhaps defining time, the very different personalities they would bring to the most influential job in the world. The occasion was not without artifice. Each man had spent hours training in the ring with their handlers. But by the time of this debate, after the feints and falsities of the first two, each seemed reduced, or refined, to an essence that could not be disguised. Gore was informed, passionate, combative, making an insistent case for what government could do. Bush was human, anxious, brief-laden, and determined to excoriate Washington at every turn. They civilly loathe each other. While both gave their own versions of the truth about health, education, national security and the rest, the rules of challenge and response produced a dialogue that could at times almost be termed Socratic. In Britain, land of debate, this has never been allowed. Originally the resistance of politicians grew out of their disdain for television: until 1959, elections were not reported by TV at all. But there were no leader debates for the next 40 years because successive leaders didn't want them. Sometimes they got close. Invariably, though, the strongest placed candidate has ducked away, or else both the big ones have sheltered behind pretended concern about what to do with the Liberal Democrat. But it is now so obvious that televised debate surpasses any other mode of voter education that these objections must be seen for what they are: ruses which put supposed party advantage far above the public interest. Politicians worry about voters' mistrust of their trade, and alienation from the process. Well, here's a device that can remake the connections and perhaps rebuild some trust. It would, admittedly, be riding with the punch of television. Instead of bleating about the rise of TV and the decline of parliament, Mr Blair, Mr Hague and Mr Kennedy would be surrendering to the power of the medium that enables them to speak direct - and some parliamentary traditionalists do not like that.

Bush was Bush. Friendly, likeable, weatherbeaten, a good man who has lived a full life. Gore was Gore. Pugnacious, determined, aggressive, a strong man who is fighting for the big prize.</p> <p>Everybody knows that Bush may lack the polish and formal training of an Al Gore or a Bill Clinton. Asked to name a book he was reading, he cited a biography of Dean Acheson, and then raised eyebrows by not seeming to know much about the former US Secretary of State. He cannot quote statistics as Gore can. His repertoire of historical anecdotes is not the equal of Bill Clinton's. He often seems at a loss for facts.

      "bodyText": "As the US presidential race unfolds, the similarities between George W Bush and his father's former boss, President Ronald Reagan, become obvious. Like Reagan, Bush is resonating with American voters at a deep, almost visceral level, telling people his instincts, priorities, and personae at a level that is more profound than Al Gore. The point became clear in Tuesday night's final TV debate. Bush was Bush. Friendly, likeable, weatherbeaten, a good man who has lived a full life. Gore was Gore. Pugnacious, determined, aggressive, a strong man who is fighting for the big prize. Everybody knows that Bush may lack the polish and formal training of an Al Gore or a Bill Clinton. Asked to name a book he was reading, he cited a biography of Dean Acheson, and then raised eyebrows by not seeming to know much about the former US Secretary of State. He cannot quote statistics as Gore can. His repertoire of historical anecdotes is not the equal of Bill Clinton's. He often seems at a loss for facts. Just like Reagan. But, like Reagan, he seems to fit comfortably within his own skin. He knows who he is and trusts his instincts about policy. He is settled on why he wants to be president and what he will do when he gets there. He may not have the right answer for every question, but he exudes a sense of self-control and confidence that inspires voters. Americans are falling in love with George W Bush as this election unfolds. Even when Gore bests him in debate, as in their first televised encounter, voters in the US are coming away from the debates with a deep respect and affection for Bush.

So how did what is universally regarded as the funniest record in history come about? The answer is an appearance on Australian TV chat show, the Money and the Gun. The gimmick of its presenter, comedian Andrew Denton, was to get each week's star turn to perform the Led Zeppelin classic. Rolf, who had never heard the song, naturally obliged. The reaction was so wildly joyous that soon he had a hit single and was playing it at Glastonbury. Bless his heart (and you do have to love him), it was only when his version had left the charts and the festivals ended that a friend played him the original. Rolf listened raptly, then remained quiet when the record finished. After a while, he found his voice. \"Oh my God,\" he whispered, \"what have I done?\"</p> <p>\u0095This mystery still needs solving: the name of my old friend Gerald Kaufman keeps cropping up in the personal ads section of the London Review of Books. \"Intelligent, old, bald woman, fond of hair, beards and Yeats, but not necessarily Rushdie (doesn't know who Gerald Kaufman is) would like to meet man to 55 who floats above all statistics and percentages,\" ran an ad in the previous edition. \"Gerald Kaufman. This had better be worth the money,\" runs an entry in the current one.

      "bodyText": "\u0095The Diary is delighted to share the solution to one of rock and pop's greatest and most enduring mysteries ... how did Rolf Harris come to record Stairway To Heaven, a number about suicide which Rolf none the less did in his usual style with didgeridoo-esque effects. So how did what is universally regarded as the funniest record in history come about? The answer is an appearance on Australian TV chat show, the Money and the Gun. The gimmick of its presenter, comedian Andrew Denton, was to get each week's star turn to perform the Led Zeppelin classic. Rolf, who had never heard the song, naturally obliged. The reaction was so wildly joyous that soon he had a hit single and was playing it at Glastonbury. Bless his heart (and you do have to love him), it was only when his version had left the charts and the festivals ended that a friend played him the original. Rolf listened raptly, then remained quiet when the record finished. After a while, he found his voice. \"Oh my God,\" he whispered, \"what have I done?\" \u0095This mystery still needs solving: the name of my old friend Gerald Kaufman keeps cropping up in the personal ads section of the London Review of Books. \"Intelligent, old, bald woman, fond of hair, beards and Yeats, but not necessarily Rushdie (doesn't know who Gerald Kaufman is) would like to meet man to 55 who floats above all statistics and percentages,\" ran an ad in the previous edition. \"Gerald Kaufman. This had better be worth the money,\" runs an entry in the current one. Can anyone help? \u0095A press release from Petra Walton at Aurelia PR heralds a launch party for a new DAKS store in the West End, and among the other \"celebrities expected to attend\" - alongside the Danish restaurateur and Sloane wannabe Mogens Tholstrup and the shoemaker Jimmy Choo - is the boulevardier Andrew Neil (Repton, Trinity Cambridge and the Guards).

      "bodyText": "A teenager was killed yesterday when he bent down to inspect a firework that seemed to have gone out after being lit, and it blew up in his face. The body of Paul Ridge, 18, was found on wasteland near the Duke of York pub in Burnley, Lancashire, in the early hours. He had died of head injuries. Apparently the firework was one of a defective batch being sold locally by an unregistered source. Detective Superintendent Graham Gooch, of Lancashire police, said the incident was a tragic waste of a young life. \"It brings home the need for us all to be careful when dealing with this kind of firework,\" he said. \"We can only repeat that this type of firework is lethal. \"It is ironic that this should have happened only hours after the county's trading standards officer and our colleagues from the fire service issued a warning about the dangers of these devices.\" Police are investigating links between the death and other incidents involving fireworks in the Burnley area. On Monday night a firework blew apart a Ford Fiesta car, and a telephone kiosk was destroyed by one at the weekend. David Brown, deputy chief officer at Lancashire trading standards, said: \"It sounds to us as if a rogue batch of fireworks, which were not meant for public sale, has found its way on to the streets.\" They may have been among a batch imported for use only at professional displays. Mr Brown said that trading standards officers were working with police to find out where the fireworks came from and why they were being sold to the public. He said that when fireworks were sold incorrectly, it was often the case that the sales were from the back of vans or at shops not registered with trading standards. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said Mr Ridge's death was the first that was directly linked with fireworks for four years, since stringent legislation banned the sale of mini-rockets and bangers. However, the society added, last year there were 1,056 injuries involving fireworks in the four weeks before bonfire night. \"These were basically where people were misusing fireworks or letting them off in places where they shouldn't have been,\" said a RoSPA spokesman, Roger Vincent. \"As this incident has shown, the golden rule is that you should never return to fireworks after they have been lit, no matter how strong the temptation.\"",

Ironically, and perhaps a tribute to the then breed of railway professionals, efficiency for a while actually increased in terms of unit operating costs and levels of external financing required. Alas it has proved to be a mirage, since all that was happening was that the assets were being sweated to an unacceptable degree. The recent disasters were waiting to happen. It will continue to get worse for as long as rolling stock and locomotives, plus train crews, are hammered day in and day out. A \"just-in-time\" business operating policy is dangerous in a mass-transit environment and it is time Railtrack and the politicians responsible got their safety priorities right. Of course the cost will be enormous and will be resisted (despite bold talk of a 10-year plan, which will never see the light of day) by the Treasury, as it has done for 50 years. What must happen to wake these people up? Adrian Berridge London \u0095 A few months ago a TGV train came off the track at nearly top speed (180mph) in the north of France. It was the first such incident in the history of the TGV system. The carriages remained upright and in line; there were a few minor injuries and no one died. Yesterday a train derailed near Hatfield at a lesser speed (115mph). The carriages were all over the place, many passengers were injured and several dead. Perhaps the British railways should adopt French technology. EJ Zuiderwijk Cambridge ejz@ast.cam.ac.uk \u0095 Officials from Railtrack and GNER, the train operating company, made sure that we knew that their \"hearts went out to the bereaved\". I would like to think these statements are heartfelt and not simply the result of image consultants suggesting that officials who spout these words will appear more human in front of an increasingly angry public. Whatever the case, actions speak louder than words. Only a genuine increase in rail safety investment will convince many of us that these people are really sorry for those who have died.

      "bodyText": "Campaigners against a controversial dam project in India yesterday condemned a decision by the supreme court in Delhi to allow stalled construction work to resume immediately. The court ruled by 2-1 that the Sardar Sarovar dam in the western state of Gujarat could be built to a height of 90 metres - it is currently 88 metres high. Work halted six years ago after objections from environmentalists and villagers whose homes have been submerged by the project. The decision was yesterday greeted with horror by Booker-prize winning novelist Arundhati Roy, who has campaigned against the dam. She told the Guardian: \"It is the most disastrous judgment I could possibly have imagined.\" Roy, who was arrested in January after leading a protest march against the dam, said the ruling was \"shocking and a defeat of democracy\". The Sardar Sarovar dam is one of a series planned for the Narmada river. Supporters say the scheme, which involves the construction of 30 major dams across three states, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, as well as 135 medium and 3,000 small dams, will reduce drought and provide vital hydroelectric power. But opponents argue that the supposed benefits do not justify the forcible displacement of tens of thousands of mainly tribal families in central and western India. Lawyers for the Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save the Narmada Movement) said yesterday that villagers in Madhya Pradesh whose homes had already been swallowed up had not yet received any land as compensation. The dissenting judge, S P Bharucha, said that all construction activities at the dam site should be stopped so that a detailed environmental survey could be carried out. But he was over-ruled by his two colleagues, who were satisfied by the aothorities' relief and rehabilitation measures. Following the ruling, triumphant state officials in Gujarat celebrated by letting off firecrackers. They said work would resume immediately. Opponents said the campaign would now return to the Narmada valley itself.",

It is British, it is art, and it has a powerful emotional impact. But Anatomical Crucifixion, one of the centrepieces of the Hayward Gallery's new Spectacular Bodies exhibition, was made by Thomas Banks for the Royal Academy of Arts almost 200 years ago. The Christ of muscle and bone is one of more than 300 images of the inside and outside of the human body, some disturbing, some beautiful, some both, garnered over five years by guest curators Martin Kemp and Marina Wallace from museums and medical institutes around the world. Many of the figures and images have seldom been seen or handled by anyone but medical professionals and students, and were never regarded by their creators as paintings, sculptures or installations. The Hayward has gone further than even Damien Hirst dared to go by putting actual human material on display - such as a human foetus in a jar, garlanded by its 18th century preservers with beads, and a dissected baby's foot.

      "body": "<p>The future of peer-to-peer computing, or P2P to its friends, came into sharp focus last week with the collapse of Scour.net, the controversial company which allows members to share the files on their computers via the internet. </p> <p>The Beverly Hills-based company backed by former superagent and former Disney president Mike Ovitz became the latest victim of the dot.com crash after falling more than $100m into debt and facing legal action from both the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America that sought to block its exchange services. </p> <p>Unlike Napster, the poster-boy of the peer-to-peer music revolution with more than 30 million registered users, Scour presented a potentially larger threat to the entertainment and information industries: Napster lets users swap only music files. Scour allows them to exchange any type of digitised information, including movies and music. </p> <p>Scour's collapse confirmed an industry-wide problem: the internet, and P2P file-swapping in particular, may be revolutionising the delivery of entertainment, but there are problems to be overcome, and quickly. Not only does wholesale P2P computing threaten the established system of creation, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copyrighted information, but it offers no workable revenue model in return. </p> <p>P2P computing has effectively made the internet into a giant copy machine, allowing users and consumers to communicate and swap far more freely than businesses producing content ever expected and would like. One thing is abundantly clear: whatever happens to companies like Napster and Scour as copyright infringement cases work their way through US courts, peer-to-peer file swapping, whether of music, films, TV programs, books or any other creative, copyrighted media that can be digitised, is not going away. </p> <p>Earlier this month in Washington DC, a publishing industry forum entitled Electronic Book 2000: Changing The Fundamentals Of Reading attracted more than 800 representatives from old-world publishing and dozens of entrepreneurs from start-up online publishers. What they heard from Dick Brass, vice president of technology development at Microsoft, was the prediction that 50% of all new books will be in electronic form within a decade. </p> <p> But Brass went on to say that if e-books become as easy to copy and distribute as MP3 files, the whole tradition of fee-based content publishing could collapse. \"The irony is that the more sophisticated the e-book industry becomes, the more tempting it will be for pirates. There is nothing less at risk than human progress and prosperity.\" </p> <p>Overwrought perhaps, but other speakers at the meeting showed how sophisticated encryption supposed to protect from wholesale copying is sophisticated only until it is broken - which doesn't take very long. \"This is so easy it doesn't even really feel like stealing,\" said Martin Eberhard, former NuvoMedia CEO, giving the encryption-cracking demonstration. </p> <p>Many fear that the Napster generation is habituated to downloading copyrighted materials for free. Trade associations have found that trying to convince them that this is theft is a tough sell. \"The anonymity of the internet gives consumers the feeling that there are no repercussions to piracy,\" says Frank Creighton, the RIAA director of anti-piracy. </p> <p>If the vast number of P2P network users has revealed anything - apart from how much all the world loves a freebie - it is that the market for digitised entertainment content is huge. But that has only added to the burden of trying to control it and finding a way of making it pay. Forrester, the internet research firm, predicts that by 2005, more than $3bn in annual music business revenue will be lost. \"Digital security will not stop theft of content, and neither will lawsuits,\" the report concludes. </p> <p>Lawsuits have become the first line of defence of the entertainment business. But it is not certain that the law will clarify the complex copyright issues at stake, and, even if it can, whether this will make a difference. \"No law can be successfully imposed on a huge population that does not morally support it and possesses easy means for its invisible evasion,\" wrote John Barlow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. </p> <p>The challenge of pure P2P computing - that is, sharing content without central control, organisation or intermediaries - is that no one owns it so no one, except perhaps its members, can make money from it. There are lots of unanswered questions about Napster and its counterparts. Could it become part of a pay ment mechanism similar to those adopted by business-to-business or business-to-consumer companies? </p> <p>In court 10 days ago to stave off a preliminary injunction that would shut it down, Napster's lawyer David Boies invoked the argument used when VCRs were introduced. He argued that even if some Napster users are infringing copyright, the service as a whole has non-infringing uses and should not be shut down. Napster executives said they hoped the issue would be settled out of court and proposed to start charging consumers a minimal amount - $5 a-month that would mean $500m a-year for the record industry. </p> <p> While the proposal comes close to the system that many believe will solve the copyright problem, it was quickly rejected by the RIAA. The recording industry does not want distribution controlled by anyone else. But to sustain the system as it is, the music industry will have to kill off the CD - something it is loath to do - to stop digitally perfect, unencrypted music getting out into the world in the first place. </p> <p>So far, at least, it seems that consumers are unwilling to pay for content on the web and will probably not become willing to do so until the broadband future arrives, if then.

      "bodyText": "The future of peer-to-peer computing, or P2P to its friends, came into sharp focus last week with the collapse of Scour.net, the controversial company which allows members to share the files on their computers via the internet. The Beverly Hills-based company backed by former superagent and former Disney president Mike Ovitz became the latest victim of the dot.com crash after falling more than $100m into debt and facing legal action from both the Motion Picture Association of America and Recording Industry Association of America that sought to block its exchange services. Unlike Napster, the poster-boy of the peer-to-peer music revolution with more than 30 million registered users, Scour presented a potentially larger threat to the entertainment and information industries: Napster lets users swap only music files. Scour allows them to exchange any type of digitised information, including movies and music. Scour's collapse confirmed an industry-wide problem: the internet, and P2P file-swapping in particular, may be revolutionising the delivery of entertainment, but there are problems to be overcome, and quickly. Not only does wholesale P2P computing threaten the established system of creation, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copyrighted information, but it offers no workable revenue model in return. P2P computing has effectively made the internet into a giant copy machine, allowing users and consumers to communicate and swap far more freely than businesses producing content ever expected and would like. One thing is abundantly clear: whatever happens to companies like Napster and Scour as copyright infringement cases work their way through US courts, peer-to-peer file swapping, whether of music, films, TV programs, books or any other creative, copyrighted media that can be digitised, is not going away. Earlier this month in Washington DC, a publishing industry forum entitled Electronic Book 2000: Changing The Fundamentals Of Reading attracted more than 800 representatives from old-world publishing and dozens of entrepreneurs from start-up online publishers. What they heard from Dick Brass, vice president of technology development at Microsoft, was the prediction that 50% of all new books will be in electronic form within a decade. But Brass went on to say that if e-books become as easy to copy and distribute as MP3 files, the whole tradition of fee-based content publishing could collapse. \"The irony is that the more sophisticated the e-book industry becomes, the more tempting it will be for pirates.

      "body": "<p>On a cold winter's morning, Mrs J looked out of her window and noticed the cows grazing in the field. She remarked to her maid how cruel the farmer was to turn the cows out on such a cold day. The maid replied that the field was empty. Mrs J was amazed. She was sane and sober, and though her eyesight was not of the best, she could see the cows quite clearly. She was experiencing Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS). </p> <p>The condition was first reported in 1760 by Charles Bonnet, a Swiss philosopher. He described the case of his grandfather, who was suffering from cataracts and started to experience \"amusing and magical\" visions. He knew they were not real and found them quite entertaining. </p> <p>The distinguishing feature of Charles Bonnet syndrome is that the patients are in a clear state of consciousness and usually quite aware that what they are seeing is an hallucination. They do not have delusions or other symptoms of mental illness. The hallucinations are notably lacking in any kind of personal meaning. </p> <p>This is in contrast to schizophrenics and others who see visions drawn from their unconscious. As one Charles Bonnet patient put it: \"These images have nothing to do with me.\" The images vary between cases but can be quite consistent. One woman found that she was being followed by a pair of children in Victorian dress. Another saw bright flowers growing everywhere she went. </p> <p>Sometimes the image moves with the patients' gaze rather than staying fixed, and sometimes it disappears if they close their eyes. The image may be blurred or translucent, but sometimes it is clearer and more detailed than real objects. </p> <p>Until quite recently Charles Bonnet syndrome was thought to be an exotic curiosity. Only a handful of cases had been written up, and it was not something that any GP would be likely to diagnose. Then a study in Holland of several hundred patients suffering from macular degeneration (a form of visual impairment common in old age) showed that 12% of them had experienced hallucinations. Further studies confirmed this finding. </p> <p>Literally millions of people have been seeing things. The vast majority have never reported the experience to anyone, let alone a doctor, because they worried about what people would think. Many of them have wondered if they really were going mad. One was even told by her GP: \"You'd better not talk about such silly things!\" A real benefit of recent research is the reassurance to patients that they are entirely sane and that Charles Bonnet syndrome is nothing to do with madness. </p> <p>If it's not the product of psychosis, what is it? Dr Dominic ffytche of the Institute of Psychiatry has been monitoring the brains of CBS patients during their hallucinations. His findings suggest that there are different types of hallucination which are related to activity in different parts of the brain. </p> <p>A minority see inanimate objects. \"I see the trees all the time,\" said one. \"I see them on TV. I see them when I look out my window. I can't go anywhere without seeing those beautiful birch trees.\" Others reported geometric patterns like a brick wall. </p> <p>But the commonest complex images are of people and faces, and this seems to be related to the structure of the brain. The brain has many specialised centres, each processing a different kind of visual information. </p> <p>For example, there is an area associated with movement; if this area is damaged, the patient loses the ability to see moving objects. If there is a spurious signal in the area which recognises a checkerboard pattern, then you see the pattern incorporated into your visual field. </p> <p>Why should spurious activity happen in the first place? One cause is sensory deprivation. When someone's sight is failing, the volume of signals to visual parts of the brain drops off. The understimulated brain may start generating signals of its own to fill in the increasing gaps. </p> <p>Another factor may be \"background noise\" in the brain. While you are looking at random shapes like clouds or a log fire, your brain is constantly looking for meaningful patterns even where there are none. Clouds become animals, and odd faces are revealed in the flames. In CBS, these attempts to find patterns may be overwhelming what little signal is there. </p> <p>CBS also occurs in those with normal eyesight, caused by factors ranging from migraine and strokes to disordered sleeping patterns and even flashing lights. </p> <p>Dr ffytche reasons that if CBS hallucinations are caused by brain activity then they should fall into types that correspond to different parts of the brain.

      "bodyText": "On a cold winter's morning, Mrs J looked out of her window and noticed the cows grazing in the field. She remarked to her maid how cruel the farmer was to turn the cows out on such a cold day. The maid replied that the field was empty. Mrs J was amazed. She was sane and sober, and though her eyesight was not of the best, she could see the cows quite clearly. She was experiencing Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS). The condition was first reported in 1760 by Charles Bonnet, a Swiss philosopher. He described the case of his grandfather, who was suffering from cataracts and started to experience \"amusing and magical\" visions. He knew they were not real and found them quite entertaining. The distinguishing feature of Charles Bonnet syndrome is that the patients are in a clear state of consciousness and usually quite aware that what they are seeing is an hallucination. They do not have delusions or other symptoms of mental illness. The hallucinations are notably lacking in any kind of personal meaning. This is in contrast to schizophrenics and others who see visions drawn from their unconscious. As one Charles Bonnet patient put it: \"These images have nothing to do with me.\" The images vary between cases but can be quite consistent. One woman found that she was being followed by a pair of children in Victorian dress. Another saw bright flowers growing everywhere she went. Sometimes the image moves with the patients' gaze rather than staying fixed, and sometimes it disappears if they close their eyes. The image may be blurred or translucent, but sometimes it is clearer and more detailed than real objects. Until quite recently Charles Bonnet syndrome was thought to be an exotic curiosity. Only a handful of cases had been written up, and it was not something that any GP would be likely to diagnose. Then a study in Holland of several hundred patients suffering from macular degeneration (a form of visual impairment common in old age) showed that 12% of them had experienced hallucinations. Further studies confirmed this finding. Literally millions of people have been seeing things. The vast majority have never reported the experience to anyone, let alone a doctor, because they worried about what people would think. Many of them have wondered if they really were going mad. One was even told by her GP: \"You'd better not talk about such silly things!\" A real benefit of recent research is the reassurance to patients that they are entirely sane and that Charles Bonnet syndrome is nothing to do with madness. If it's not the product of psychosis, what is it? Dr Dominic ffytche of the Institute of Psychiatry has been monitoring the brains of CBS patients during their hallucinations. His findings suggest that there are different types of hallucination which are related to activity in different parts of the brain. A minority see inanimate objects. \"I see the trees all the time,\" said one. \"I see them on TV. I see them when I look out my window. I can't go anywhere without seeing those beautiful birch trees.\" Others reported geometric patterns like a brick wall. But the commonest complex images are of people and faces, and this seems to be related to the structure of the brain. The brain has many specialised centres, each processing a different kind of visual information. For example, there is an area associated with movement; if this area is damaged, the patient loses the ability to see moving objects. If there is a spurious signal in the area which recognises a checkerboard pattern, then you see the pattern incorporated into your visual field. Why should spurious activity happen in the first place? One cause is sensory deprivation. When someone's sight is failing, the volume of signals to visual parts of the brain drops off. The understimulated brain may start generating signals of its own to fill in the increasing gaps. Another factor may be \"background noise\" in the brain. While you are looking at random shapes like clouds or a log fire, your brain is constantly looking for meaningful patterns even where there are none. Clouds become animals, and odd faces are revealed in the flames. In CBS, these attempts to find patterns may be overwhelming what little signal is there. CBS also occurs in those with normal eyesight, caused by factors ranging from migraine and strokes to disordered sleeping patterns and even flashing lights. Dr ffytche reasons that if CBS hallucinations are caused by brain activity then they should fall into types that correspond to different parts of the brain. His research bears this out. One group of patients reported seeing people, sometimes small or tiny, often wearing distinctive period clothes or uniforms and hats. A second group saw disembodied faces - mainly grotesque or distorted with bulging eyes. The first group corresponds to disturbances in the ventral temporal lobe, the area which identifies figures and costumes; the second group with the STS region, which is specialised for facial recognition. We can readily imagine the effect of CBS visions on the experiencer, especially in a less scientific age. An old person with failing eyesight living in isolation might very well start to see colourful little figures, perhaps wearing outlandish clothes. These little people would be amusing and magical, visible but not quite solid, with a tendency to van ish if you blinked or took your eye off them. Fairies and pixies, leprechauns and their kind may not be myths at all. They may be visitors from that most wondrous of mystical realms, the hidden kingdom of the human mind. The chosen few who can see them (and their cows), tend to stay silent about it. We can only wonder at what other denizens will appear as science sheds light into the workings of the brain. \u0095 Dr Ffytche is collecting descriptions of CBS hallucinations, and can be contacted at d.ffytche@iop.kcl.ac.uk or Institute of Psychiatry, De Crespigny Park, London SE5 8AF.",

Thanks to a built-in clock/calendar, Aibo can even remember birthdays. </p> <p>But the biggest change of all is that if you want one, you can buy one. When Sony offers the new Aibo for sale at <a href=\"http://www.aibo.com\">www.aibo.com</a> on November 16, it will build as many as are needed to meet demand. This is not quite the same as a continuous production line, but it could become one. </p> <p>The first limited edition Aibo ERA-110 made headlines last June when the 3,000 offered for sale in Japan were snapped up in just 20 minutes. Another 2,000 also sold quickly in North America, in spite of the hefty $2,500 price tag. </p> <p>Sony came back for another bite at the market in November, holding a lottery to sell 10,000 of the revised Aibo ERA-111. This came in a choice of colours - black, as well as the original silver - and, for the first time, was sold in Europe. Orders flooded in: 132,000 from Japan, 2,000 from North America, and 1,000 from Europe. </p> <p>Another 30,000 Aibos were sold in February, taking the total population up to 45,000. About 90% of those live in Japan. </p> <p>\"Nobody expected that much demand,\" says Satoshi Amagai, president of Sony's Entertainment Robot Company. \"Even now we're not sure how much demand there is, and what are the success factors that attract people. We have to be super-flexible to follow the movements of the market. The problem is, you never know.\" </p> <p>With the new version available in gold, silver or black, Amagai is planning to expand the market, starting with sales in Singapore and Hong Kong. South Korea may be next. </p> <p>He also wants to build up a business in software and accessories for Aibo, which has a 192MHz Mips processor and 32 megabytes of memory. This will include programs supplied on Sony Memory Sticks with CDs for PCs running Microsoft Windows. </p> <p>Aibo Life is the basic program: it lets owners raise and train an Aibo from \"birth\". Hello Aibo is an accessory pack \"for busy people\": it provides an energetic adult Aibo that owners can show off to their friends. Party Mascot includes games and is described as \"great for parties and other events\". </p> <p>Other software includes the Aibo Fun Pack, which works with the Aibo Life Memory Stick, and Aibo Master Studio, which lets owners program their own behaviours. Accessories range from spare batteries to carrying bags, some of them not available until February. </p> <p>In February, Sony plans to release an Aibo Wireless LAN card, so an Aibo can become part of a wireless Ethernet local area network, making it much easier to program from a PC. Wireless Ethernet is becoming popular as a way of connecting several home PCs together to share a high-speed internet connection, such as ADSL. </p> <p>There are enough products to push the package price back up from \u00a31,590 (for a standard Aibo with Aibo Life) to \u00a32,400 or more. However, Amagai is also looking at other spin-offs. \"The thing is, this is not just hardware, it's a new form of entertainment,\" he says. \"so people can enjoy a wide range of offers. One of the ideas we're discussing is making a movie. Or publishing a book, or coming up with Aibo-character souvenirs. One of the benchmarks is Nintendo's Pok\u00e9mon! </p> <p>\"We're also looking at communications: how Aibo could communicate with your personal computer or PDA [personal digital assistant] or with another Aibo. We are studying Bluetooth, wireless iLink, all the technologies, to see which ones to pick. The new Aibo will already communicate with a desktop or notebook PC.\" </p> <p> Most of this sounds as though it could appeal to the somewhat geeky audience that the Aibo enjoys outside Japan. It might even encourage people to think of practical applications for the dog, perhaps for remote monitoring. But the mass market of toy buyers is clearly some way away, and it is much further away in Europe than it is in Japan. </p> <p>Amagai says: \"Sales of this Aibo will tell us about the differences between countries. We believe there is vast potential in Europe and North America, otherwise the market will be significantly limited. Young people in Japan are keen to take anything new, and will spend much money, but that won't last forever.\" </p> <p>You might have thought one obvious way to broaden the market would be to offer a robot cat instead of another robodog, and the latest version has new cat-like ears instead of the droopy dog-ears of the original. </p> <p>But Amagai protests. \"We never said this was a dog!\" he exclaims. \"That's part of the reason this new Aibo is not as dog-like. Concept-wise it's a baby lion, which is more related to the cat, so hopefully this will attract more cat lovers.\"</p>",

That's what James Gillies and Robert Cailliau have done, but given the title of their book, you can hardly complain. What it says is what you get. </p> <p>The book is, of course, special in being co-authored by two scientists from Cern in Switzerland, Europe's particle physics laboratory, where the World-Wide Web was created. Indeed, one was so closely involved that in the early 90s, we used to credit Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau for its development. </p> <p>But in 1995, TBL went off to start the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT, Cern's web work was trans ferred to Inria in Paris, and that's where this story ends. </p> <p>Most of the first half of the book is devoted to computer history, starting in the 40s. Topics include the origins of the internet; Doug Engelbart, the inventor of the mouse; and Ted Nelson, who coined the term hypertext and conceptually pre-invented the web. It also covers the Viewdata (text to TV) saga, including BT's Prestel and France Telecom's Teletel (Minitel). </p> <p>The book's European perspective is interesting, but these fields have been ploughed many times before. </p> <p>The story of the web's development at Cern is told in sometimes excruciating detail, with Cailliau being treated just like any other character. This approach is fair, and seems to ensure that even the minor participants are given their due. </p> <p>However, you may still be left with the impression that TBL would have developed something like the web wherever he'd ended up, but without him, Cern would never have given birth to the web. (JS)</p> <p><strong> Game just complicates a simple story </strong></p> <p><strong>The Little Prince</strong> Tivola CD \u00a319.99 <br> Woe betide any new user who loses the packaging for The Little Prince: the charmed world may remain a locked book forever - which, since the little prince sharply divides the real world into those melted or nauseated, some might regard as a blessing. </p> <p>My copy of the book came from a Canadian who had discovered it while driving a school bus in Alaska, and had taken great comfort from the story of the unhappy adult who finds universal truths in the deceptively simple words of the strange and Christ-like little boy he meets in the desert. </p> <p>Ever after, like many Little Prince zealots, the Canadian had gone about the world scattering copies among the unbeliever. </p> <p>I was intrigued by the book, but toe-curlingly embarrassed by its faithful. </p> <p>In my experience child-like simplicity is wasted on the young, but Samuel, aged six, was cheerfully prepared to tackle the CD claimed by Tivola to be aimed at ages 8-102. </p> <p>It loaded clunkily enough on my Mac PowerBook, once we'd reset the colours, and up came the usual charming Tivola opening titles, and appealing vaguely New Agey music. Samuel found it very hard to plonk his star cursor on a passing meteorite or comet - and when I helped I found it extremely difficult to be sure I'd clicked accurately enough, and dull enough in some cases when successful. </p> <p>Landing on Saturn launches the book. </p> <p>Most Tivola CDs we've played with have lucid instructions built into the disc, but this gave no guidance on how to get the lovely Kenneth Branagh to read us the text: we went fruit lessly back to the CD case, and by the time I'd found the pamphlet in the packaging inside the box Samuel had lost interest and has not been tempted back since. </p> <p>Mr Branagh reads it beautifully, of course, but the same maddening imprecision applies to clicking on page corners to continue the story, and animating sections of the illustrations. </p> <p>The Fox Taming Game - again, don't throw away that booklet or you're finished - was pretty to look at but baffled both of us. Samuel was intrigued enough to come and look over my shoulder at the animated biography of the author, but he liked only the crashed plane. </p> <p>I hoped it might include a war game sequence based on the legal actions raging around Saint-Exupery's estate, but alas, no. </p> <p>You can't go into a toy shop in France now without being stunned by the scale of the Little Prince merchandising industry. I can't see this CD becoming a market leader. (MK)</p>",

It also covers the Viewdata (text to TV) saga, including BT's Prestel and France Telecom's Teletel (Minitel). The book's European perspective is interesting, but these fields have been ploughed many times before. The story of the web's development at Cern is told in sometimes excruciating detail, with Cailliau being treated just like any other character. This approach is fair, and seems to ensure that even the minor participants are given their due. However, you may still be left with the impression that TBL would have developed something like the web wherever he'd ended up, but without him, Cern would never have given birth to the web. (JS) Game just complicates a simple story The Little Prince Tivola CD \u00a319.99 Woe betide any new user who loses the packaging for The Little Prince: the charmed world may remain a locked book forever - which, since the little prince sharply divides the real world into those melted or nauseated, some might regard as a blessing. My copy of the book came from a Canadian who had discovered it while driving a school bus in Alaska, and had taken great comfort from the story of the unhappy adult who finds universal truths in the deceptively simple words of the strange and Christ-like little boy he meets in the desert. Ever after, like many Little Prince zealots, the Canadian had gone about the world scattering copies among the unbeliever. I was intrigued by the book, but toe-curlingly embarrassed by its faithful. In my experience child-like simplicity is wasted on the young, but Samuel, aged six, was cheerfully prepared to tackle the CD claimed by Tivola to be aimed at ages 8-102. It loaded clunkily enough on my Mac PowerBook, once we'd reset the colours, and up came the usual charming Tivola opening titles, and appealing vaguely New Agey music. Samuel found it very hard to plonk his star cursor on a passing meteorite or comet - and when I helped I found it extremely difficult to be sure I'd clicked accurately enough, and dull enough in some cases when successful. Landing on Saturn launches the book. Most Tivola CDs we've played with have lucid instructions built into the disc, but this gave no guidance on how to get the lovely Kenneth Branagh to read us the text: we went fruit lessly back to the CD case, and by the time I'd found the pamphlet in the packaging inside the box Samuel had lost interest and has not been tempted back since. Mr Branagh reads it beautifully, of course, but the same maddening imprecision applies to clicking on page corners to continue the story, and animating sections of the illustrations. The Fox Taming Game - again, don't throw away that booklet or you're finished - was pretty to look at but baffled both of us. Samuel was intrigued enough to come and look over my shoulder at the animated biography of the author, but he liked only the crashed plane. I hoped it might include a war game sequence based on the legal actions raging around Saint-Exupery's estate, but alas, no. You can't go into a toy shop in France now without being stunned by the scale of the Little Prince merchandising industry. I can't see this CD becoming a market leader. (MK)",

Unlike Baldur's Gate and the rest, W&amp;W plays in the first person, although Quake fans will find their reflexes remain untested. </p> <p>Instead there is copious prose and a stash of spells as you set out to find a \"magical sword\". Thankfully this sub-Tolkein nonsense is bolstered by an imaginative variety of races - from magical elephants to crossbred lizards. </p> <p>However, once you've raised your stat level a few times and bought that snazzy new chain mail, the paucity of original thought matters less. </p> <p>Persevere and it is soon clear that there is little here that will appeal to the unconvinced. The game plays out exactly as you'd expect, with your party having numerous dungeons to loot and abundant quests to complete. </p> <p>The control and combat work well enough but, with at least 120 hours of play, it's likely that most will never see the end credits. Also, with Baldur's Gate 2 offering similar thrills to the same audience, there may simply not be enough time to play both. One for the hardcore fans only. (GH)</p> <p><strong> Vicarious Viking vicissitudes<br> Cultures</strong> PC CD-rom \u00a329.99 Funatics/THQ *** <br> The god sim is back, and this time it's personal. A little too personal, in fact. </p> <p>Overseeing a small community of Vikings settling Greenland, you're on first-name terms with everyone: Sven the huntsman, Ingmar the scout, Frieda the, er, woman. And you must micro-manage every aspect of their lives: their jobs, their domestic arrangements, the layout of the town, even what sex their baby should be. </p> <p>The big idea here is that each of your subjects is a genuine individual - no two look the same, and all, supposedly, have their own peculiar quirks. </p> <p>With their sweetly animated features, it's all too easy to become attached to your little Scandinavians. Which is fine as long as you're building a happy community - but a different story when it comes to sending Benny and Bjorn into battle. </p> <p>Because yours is not the only tribe trying to build a new life in the new world. There are Inuits and Native Americans here, too. </p> <p>For a time, you will be able to coexist and trade peacefully, but eventually resources are going to run out, tensions are going to rise, and you're going to have to build a graveyard next to that woodcutter's tent. </p> <p>This odd disjunction between cuteness and horror is one of many in Cultures: another is the disparity of timescales, which allows you to conceive a child, bring him up, train him as a soldier and send him to his death in the time it takes for Ingmar to recce the west of the island. </p> <p>Furthermore, while some characters, such as bakers and fishermen, will happily beaver away unassisted, seeking out their own materials, others - scouts, soldiers, builders - crave attention like a rock star's daughter, having to be told where to go, what to do, even when to eat and sleep. </p> <p>Given the prospective size of your settlement, the complexity of the infrastructure, and the fiddliness of the interface, this is no small task. </p> <p>On the other hand, the pace of the game is so infernally slow - a coastal raid with these particular Vikings turns into a two-week beach holiday - that keeping tabs on them all is easier than you'd think. </p> <p>In sum, then, Cultures is a thoughtful, jolly, ruddy-cheeked affair, put together with a great deal of love and attention - and, to be brutal, very little concern for playability. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Veteran racing champion is overtaken<br> F1 Championship Season 2000 </strong> Sony PlayStation \u00a334.99 Electronic Arts **** <strong> Formula One 2000 </strong> Sony PlayStation \u00a325-30 Studio 33/Psygnosis *** <br> When you load Formula One 2000, you wonder if PlayStation graphics have improved at all in the past four years. Then when you run F1 Championship Season, the full-motion video and fabulous tracks make you wonder why all PSX games aren't as brilliant as this. </p> <p>Formula One 2000 is in its fifth year and the series has sold more than 4 million units. It has a commentary by Murray Walker, and while the starting interface is clunky, it is very easy to play. Overtaking is simple, and you can take long excursions across the greens and gravel traps and still win races. If other cars are in the way, bumping them up the gearbox often helps. </p> <p>F1 Championship Season 2000 is a completely different matter. EA's second annual trip to the starting grid is a vastly more realistic simulation. The tracks, which ought to be the same, seem much shorter, and the corners are harder to get round, unless you brake well in advance. </p> <p>Bump into other cars and shards of carbon fibre fly in all directions. Go off the track and you frequently end up pointing the wrong way while a dozen cars stream past. </p> <p>Eventually you lose gears, wheels fly off, and you end up retiring rather than winning. The game is a bit more forgiving that the real thing, but 16 laps of precision racing is still a challenge. </p> <p>The simulation continues in staggering detail through all the testing, qualifying and racing through all kinds of weather. And while you don't get Murray Walker (as a driver, you wouldn't), you do get realistic race intros from Jim Rosenthal and in-race instructions from your pit crew. The only real problem is that the controls are very twitchy and take some getting used to, though this could also be true to life. </p> <p>Psygnosis's Formula One 2000 is still a good game, and after EA's F1, you get to appreciate the (unrealistically) easy overtaking and (unrealistic) on-screen map of the circuit. Its arcade option is great fun, especially in two-player mode. </p> <p>While F1 Championship Season 2000 also has a quick race mode, its simulation takes the genre to a level we never expected to see on a PlayStation. I can hardly wait for the PlayStation 2 version. (JS)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Swordfighting sorcerers lose their charm Wizards &amp; Warriors PC CD Rom \u00a329.99 Heuristic Park/Activision *** He may not be as well known as Richard \"Ultima\" Garriot, but DW Bradley has a respected track record and his latest effort is an important release for the role playing games (RPG) community. But, while it may have been four years in the making, the anachronistic Wizards And Warriors could have been released any time in the last 14 years. Sporadically impressive 3D graphics or not, this is an RPG so dated that only the committed will care. Unlike Baldur's Gate and the rest, W&amp;W plays in the first person, although Quake fans will find their reflexes remain untested. Instead there is copious prose and a stash of spells as you set out to find a \"magical sword\". Thankfully this sub-Tolkein nonsense is bolstered by an imaginative variety of races - from magical elephants to crossbred lizards. However, once you've raised your stat level a few times and bought that snazzy new chain mail, the paucity of original thought matters less. Persevere and it is soon clear that there is little here that will appeal to the unconvinced. The game plays out exactly as you'd expect, with your party having numerous dungeons to loot and abundant quests to complete. The control and combat work well enough but, with at least 120 hours of play, it's likely that most will never see the end credits. Also, with Baldur's Gate 2 offering similar thrills to the same audience, there may simply not be enough time to play both. One for the hardcore fans only. (GH) Vicarious Viking vicissitudes Cultures PC CD-rom \u00a329.99 Funatics/THQ *** The god sim is back, and this time it's personal. A little too personal, in fact. Overseeing a small community of Vikings settling Greenland, you're on first-name terms with everyone: Sven the huntsman, Ingmar the scout, Frieda the, er, woman. And you must micro-manage every aspect of their lives: their jobs, their domestic arrangements, the layout of the town, even what sex their baby should be. The big idea here is that each of your subjects is a genuine individual - no two look the same, and all, supposedly, have their own peculiar quirks. With their sweetly animated features, it's all too easy to become attached to your little Scandinavians. Which is fine as long as you're building a happy community - but a different story when it comes to sending Benny and Bjorn into battle. Because yours is not the only tribe trying to build a new life in the new world. There are Inuits and Native Americans here, too. For a time, you will be able to coexist and trade peacefully, but eventually resources are going to run out, tensions are going to rise, and you're going to have to build a graveyard next to that woodcutter's tent. This odd disjunction between cuteness and horror is one of many in Cultures: another is the disparity of timescales, which allows you to conceive a child, bring him up, train him as a soldier and send him to his death in the time it takes for Ingmar to recce the west of the island. Furthermore, while some characters, such as bakers and fishermen, will happily beaver away unassisted, seeking out their own materials, others - scouts, soldiers, builders - crave attention like a rock star's daughter, having to be told where to go, what to do, even when to eat and sleep. Given the prospective size of your settlement, the complexity of the infrastructure, and the fiddliness of the interface, this is no small task. On the other hand, the pace of the game is so infernally slow - a coastal raid with these particular Vikings turns into a two-week beach holiday - that keeping tabs on them all is easier than you'd think. In sum, then, Cultures is a thoughtful, jolly, ruddy-cheeked affair, put together with a great deal of love and attention - and, to be brutal, very little concern for playability. (AB) Veteran racing champion is overtaken F1 Championship Season 2000 Sony PlayStation \u00a334.99 Electronic Arts **** Formula One 2000 Sony PlayStation \u00a325-30 Studio 33/Psygnosis *** When you load Formula One 2000, you wonder if PlayStation graphics have improved at all in the past four years. Then when you run F1 Championship Season, the full-motion video and fabulous tracks make you wonder why all PSX games aren't as brilliant as this. Formula One 2000 is in its fifth year and the series has sold more than 4 million units. It has a commentary by Murray Walker, and while the starting interface is clunky, it is very easy to play. Overtaking is simple, and you can take long excursions across the greens and gravel traps and still win races. If other cars are in the way, bumping them up the gearbox often helps. F1 Championship Season 2000 is a completely different matter. EA's second annual trip to the starting grid is a vastly more realistic simulation. The tracks, which ought to be the same, seem much shorter, and the corners are harder to get round, unless you brake well in advance. Bump into other cars and shards of carbon fibre fly in all directions. Go off the track and you frequently end up pointing the wrong way while a dozen cars stream past. Eventually you lose gears, wheels fly off, and you end up retiring rather than winning. The game is a bit more forgiving that the real thing, but 16 laps of precision racing is still a challenge. The simulation continues in staggering detail through all the testing, qualifying and racing through all kinds of weather. And while you don't get Murray Walker (as a driver, you wouldn't), you do get realistic race intros from Jim Rosenthal and in-race instructions from your pit crew. The only real problem is that the controls are very twitchy and take some getting used to, though this could also be true to life. Psygnosis's Formula One 2000 is still a good game, and after EA's F1, you get to appreciate the (unrealistically) easy overtaking and (unrealistic) on-screen map of the circuit. Its arcade option is great fun, especially in two-player mode. While F1 Championship Season 2000 also has a quick race mode, its simulation takes the genre to a level we never expected to see on a PlayStation. I can hardly wait for the PlayStation 2 version.

The convergence with wireless devices is just one step on the road to transforming the way we live our lives both at home and in the workplace",

      "body": "<p>For someone who ranks 171st in the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles' top 500 singles artists of all time, Jason Donovan is, curiously, remembered for music hardly at all. It comes as a shock to discover that from 1988-93 he had 17 hits, including four number ones. Who now remembers, say, the Joseph Mega Remix (number 13 in 1991)? Or, indeed, any of them except possibly Especially For You, the spewsome Christmas 1988 duet with his then girlfriend, Kylie Minogue? It's as if all memory of the blond, blank-eyed surfer boy and his lengthy residency at the pre-Matthew Bannister Radio 1 has been collectively erased. </p> <p>Maybe it's because songwriters Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman gave all the best songs to Kylie, leaving Donovan floundering with the unmemorable off-cuts. More likely, though, it's because Donovan himself admits he was \"a puppet of pop\" during that period, whisked from his role as mullet-haired Scott Mitchell in Neighbours to pop stardom with little consideration as to whether he could actually sing. </p> <p>But that was typical of Donovan's career until about six years ago. Everything he did, from acting to singing to West End musicals, was predicated on his spanielish looks, so he got by handsomely without being especially gifted at any one thing. Then, around 1994 when he was 26, he began to go bald. For most men it's a blow. For Donovan it was a disaster, and his reaction was extreme. But let him tell it: \"I'd just finished starring in Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and I suddenly noticed I was losing my hair. If you're blond-haired and blue-eyed, you think it's the death of your desirability. You don't see the big picture and think you might be Sean Connery in 40 years. All I had was the Jason Donovan look, and I thought, fuck. That was a major thing for me, and it started me on drugs.\" </p> <p>He relates this readily, stopping every few sentences for a sip of Coke and a restless tap of fingers and feet. It's late afternoon in a nearly deserted bar near his home in Notting Hill, and he has sandwiched this interview - to promote his new film, Sorted - between packing for a trip to Australia and a visit to the dentist. Perhaps it's just the stress of fitting everything in to a couple of hours, but he's not relaxed. There are only two other customers in the place, and the silence seems to agitate him. </p> <p>At the start, bounding in dressed in a grey pinstriped suit and sporting a crewcut, he is tense but relatively composed; within seconds there is a gradual escalation of tapping and twitching. After five minutes he is rocking back and forth in his seat, puffing at a Marlboro Light and manically drumming his fingers. </p> <p>Are you all right? \"Yeah, yeah, I'm always hyper.\" You're not on drugs, are you? \"Course not,\" he booms in his unexpectedly deep voice, crossing and uncrossing his legs wildly. </p> <p>Actually, he probably isn't. He does admit to taking drugs occasionally, \"but they're not my mistress any more; they're just an acquaintance. Not the love affair of my life now.\" He is so straightforward, answering every question with unguarded honesty, that if he was on drugs he would probably say so. After all, he was completely open about his reason for rooting his way through an estimated \u00a3250,000- worth of cocaine in four years: \"I loved it. I'm not going to lie and blame my mother or fame or something. I really loved it.\" </p> <p>Donovan's fall from teen-pop grace was swift and sharp. He had already made himself unpopular with the public by suing the Face magazine in 1992 for alleging he was a closeted homosexual, so when he began to topple - losing hair, looks and record deal within months - there was no one to catch him. He got addicted to cocaine, collapsed four times in public and within months would have made a fine Tory poster boy for the dangers of drug abuse. </p> <p>His deterioration is all the more startling when compared with Minogue's perennial lustrousness; they are both 32 but, it has been jibed, he could be the portrait in her attic. The decline has been arrested in the past year or so and he is now craggily attractive, but it is still a surprise. \"Kylie? She must be brushing her teeth and flossing every night,\" he says, feigning a yawn. \"Boring, mate.\" </p> <p>Of the two, he has certainly had the more interesting career, especially for the last few years. Baldness, you might say, has been the making of him. Divested of his floppy mop, he is suddenly in demand for character parts and has rather cornered the market in transvestite roles. The first was a long stint as Frank N Furter in a touring production of The Rocky Horror Show and in Sorted he plays a television disc jockey who works in a nightclub. He is barely recognisable in the film - look for the black Uma Thurman wig and corset. </p> <p>Does he see a pattern here? \"I just have good legs! No, I don't know why these roles have chosen me. I was a gay icon, so it's plausible to throw me in drag and get a reaction.\" </p> <p>Sorted has had deservedly poor reviews for being a threadbare club pastiche which locates Scunthorpe in Yorkshire rather than Lincolnshire, but Donovan turns in a decent performance. \"I haven't read the reviews because I knew what they'd probably say. No disrespect, but I did a good job. I've got belief in myself, a lot of belief. We're all our own God.\" He taps distractedly. \"I don't believe in anti-capitalism,\" he says, suddenly. \"Democracy is built on inequality and I'd rather be in a democracy than a fat-cat communist regime.\" </p> <p> This non sequitur leads to an entertaining rant that ends with, \"I think I'm a hippy, though. I love smoking pot. Zero tolerance? Good luck, Ann Widdecombe.\" He is, however, about to leave Notting Hill for the less hedonistic environs of Chiswick, near the river in west London. \"My house is sort of a disco house, and I want to put my demons to bed. Sometimes... well, at three in the morning when your face drops and you're thinking, should I get in that car and potentially do a lot of things I shouldn't do... I don't need that any more.\" </p> <p>So Donovan is taking a step towards adulthood, renting a new house for himself, his girlfriend Ange, their daughter, Gemma, and their unborn baby, which is due in March, just as Gemma celebrates her first birthday. He didn't waste time, did he? \"We're a highly sexed couple,\" he grins. He split up with Ange during her first pregnancy, but they are back together because Donovan felt prickings of conscience. \"I rise to the responsibility. I mean, it's my sperm,\" he offers gamely. \"And I've fallen in love with this woman who's helped me to be reborn.\" </p> <p>His tapping slows to a companionable rhythm and he delivers a crunching Bondi handshake. \"Later,\" he says, and you smile back, unaccountably pleased to have met him.</p>",

I'm not going to lie and blame my mother or fame or something. I really loved it.\" Donovan's fall from teen-pop grace was swift and sharp. He had already made himself unpopular with the public by suing the Face magazine in 1992 for alleging he was a closeted homosexual, so when he began to topple - losing hair, looks and record deal within months - there was no one to catch him. He got addicted to cocaine, collapsed four times in public and within months would have made a fine Tory poster boy for the dangers of drug abuse. His deterioration is all the more startling when compared with Minogue's perennial lustrousness; they are both 32 but, it has been jibed, he could be the portrait in her attic. The decline has been arrested in the past year or so and he is now craggily attractive, but it is still a surprise. \"Kylie? She must be brushing her teeth and flossing every night,\" he says, feigning a yawn. \"Boring, mate.\" Of the two, he has certainly had the more interesting career, especially for the last few years. Baldness, you might say, has been the making of him. Divested of his floppy mop, he is suddenly in demand for character parts and has rather cornered the market in transvestite roles. The first was a long stint as Frank N Furter in a touring production of The Rocky Horror Show and in Sorted he plays a television disc jockey who works in a nightclub. He is barely recognisable in the film - look for the black Uma Thurman wig and corset. Does he see a pattern here? \"I just have good legs! No, I don't know why these roles have chosen me. I was a gay icon, so it's plausible to throw me in drag and get a reaction.\" Sorted has had deservedly poor reviews for being a threadbare club pastiche which locates Scunthorpe in Yorkshire rather than Lincolnshire, but Donovan turns in a decent performance. \"I haven't read the reviews because I knew what they'd probably say. No disrespect, but I did a good job. I've got belief in myself, a lot of belief. We're all our own God.\" He taps distractedly. \"I don't believe in anti-capitalism,\" he says, suddenly. \"Democracy is built on inequality and I'd rather be in a democracy than a fat-cat communist regime.\" This non sequitur leads to an entertaining rant that ends with, \"I think I'm a hippy, though. I love smoking pot. Zero tolerance? Good luck, Ann Widdecombe.\" He is, however, about to leave Notting Hill for the less hedonistic environs of Chiswick, near the river in west London. \"My house is sort of a disco house, and I want to put my demons to bed. Sometimes... well, at three in the morning when your face drops and you're thinking, should I get in that car and potentially do a lot of things I shouldn't do... I don't need that any more.\" So Donovan is taking a step towards adulthood, renting a new house for himself, his girlfriend Ange, their daughter, Gemma, and their unborn baby, which is due in March, just as Gemma celebrates her first birthday. He didn't waste time, did he? \"We're a highly sexed couple,\" he grins. He split up with Ange during her first pregnancy, but they are back together because Donovan felt prickings of conscience. \"I rise to the responsibility. I mean, it's my sperm,\" he offers gamely. \"And I've fallen in love with this woman who's helped me to be reborn.\" His tapping slows to a companionable rhythm and he delivers a crunching Bondi handshake. \"Later,\" he says, and you smile back, unaccountably pleased to have met him.",
