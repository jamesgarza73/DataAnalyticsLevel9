But with funds at a premium at St James' Park pending the European Commission's decision on the future of the transfer system, the manager Bobby Robson has been granted only \u00a31.5m to conjure up a replacement for the injured Alan Shearer and Carl Cort. The Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd yesterday returned from Paris where he had attempted to entice the \u00a33.25m Didier Domi back to the north-east. The full-back, who is anxious to re-sign for his former club Paris St-Germain, has been absent without leave since before Christmas. Rangers today expect Lorenzo Amoruso to announce whether he intends to move to West Ham. \"He is back in Italy right now and I think he wants a bit of time on his own to think things over,\" said David Murray, the Ibrox chairman. \"We have agreed a transfer fee with West Ham but if Lorenzo says he wants to stay with the club, then we shall accept that.\" West Ham are also considering a \u00a36m bid for Aston Villa's Gareth Southgate. \"I rate Gareth highly, both as a player and a professional, and it's time we put in an offer,\" said West Ham's manager Harry Redknapp. \"I wouldn't mind having both Southgate and Amoruso at Upton Park. Lorenzo has a presence about him. He's strong and powerful.\" Steve Lomas, moreover, has said he has no desire to leave Upton Park despite interest from his former club Manchester City. \"Unless the club tell me any different I am more than happy to be at West Ham and proud to play for them.\" Ipswich have turned down Nottingham Forest's \u00a32.5m bid for David Johnson.",

Investment powers: Trustees may make any investment of the kind that they could if the funds were their own, except for land outside the UK, settled land or university land. Investment duties: Trustees must review investments regularly and obtain proper advice and consider whether there is a need for diversification of funds. Delegation of trust functions: A trustee can now delegate day to day duties to an agent, for example managing, acquiring or disposing of investment land. Delegating investment management: Trustees must prepare a written statement giving guidance on how the investment management functions should be managed in the best interest of the charity. Reimbursement of trustees' expenses: The Act allows for payment of out-of-pocket expenses without the need for an authorising clause in the deed. Paying fees to trustees: The Act regulates the arrangement for paying a trustee who is appointed in their professional capacity, for example a solicitor or accountant. Insuring a trust: The Act creates a power for trustees to insure a trust's property. \u0095 The Trustee Act 2000 is available, priced \u00a35.95 plus P&amp;P, from the Stationery Office, PO Box 29, Norwich NR3 1GN, tel: 08457 023474",

A standard against which most contemporary children's writing is measured, Garner once claimed that he didn't consciously think of children when writing his books but believed that they read him \"more intelligently\" than adults did.</p> <p>Thanking those who had supported his work, Garner said: \"The author is like the flyer in a high trapeze act. It is the catcher who does much of the hard work, often in obscurity, through telling the flyer when to let go and not letting him fall.\"</p> <p>Garner's published his first book, The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, at the age of 22. In 1967 his mythical tragedy The Owl Service, melding Welsh folktale and a modern broken home, won the Carnegie medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Award. His latest book, The Well of the Wind, was published in 1998. </p> <p>Born in Congleton, Garner has lived in Cheshire all his life, taking inspiration from his sense of place and history. The first of his family to go to university, he met both JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis while at college in Oxford. Like them his work contains supernatural elements and has strong appeal for adult readers, although as he never reads fiction - not wanting to be subconsciously influenced by other writers' ideas - he has read neither.</p> <p><strong>Recommended works</strong></p> <p><strong>Red Shift</strong><br>A novel for 'young adults', this bleak and allusive tale of love and madness switches between three time frames: Roman Britain (with shades of Vietnam), the Civil War era and a contemporary troubled teenager. Violent and tender by turns, it towers over most 'grown-up' writing.</p> <p><strong>The Owl Service</strong><br>A rewriting of the Mabinogion, a classic coming-of-age tale exploring puberty and poltergeists and a chilling ghost story about the power of the past. A children's book, but a very good one indeed.</p> <p><strong>Strandloper</strong><br>If you liked him as a child, try this 1996 novel for adults which intertwines Aboriginal dreamtime and Old England.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ozemail.com.au/~xenophon/\">Unofficial Alan Garner site</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ub.rug.nl/camelot/intrvws/garner.htm\"> 1989 Interview with Alan Garner</a></p>",

Though 66-year-old Garner brings similar elements of history and myth to his writing for both adults and children, he said he was \"particularly gratified\" that the OBE is for services to children's literature. A standard against which most contemporary children's writing is measured, Garner once claimed that he didn't consciously think of children when writing his books but believed that they read him \"more intelligently\" than adults did. Thanking those who had supported his work, Garner said: \"The author is like the flyer in a high trapeze act. It is the catcher who does much of the hard work, often in obscurity, through telling the flyer when to let go and not letting him fall.\" Garner's published his first book, The Weirdstone of Brisingamen, at the age of 22. In 1967 his mythical tragedy The Owl Service, melding Welsh folktale and a modern broken home, won the Carnegie medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Award. His latest book, The Well of the Wind, was published in 1998. Born in Congleton, Garner has lived in Cheshire all his life, taking inspiration from his sense of place and history. The first of his family to go to university, he met both JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis while at college in Oxford. Like them his work contains supernatural elements and has strong appeal for adult readers, although as he never reads fiction - not wanting to be subconsciously influenced by other writers' ideas - he has read neither. Recommended works Red Shift A novel for 'young adults', this bleak and allusive tale of love and madness switches between three time frames: Roman Britain (with shades of Vietnam), the Civil War era and a contemporary troubled teenager. Violent and tender by turns, it towers over most 'grown-up' writing. The Owl Service A rewriting of the Mabinogion, a classic coming-of-age tale exploring puberty and poltergeists and a chilling ghost story about the power of the past. A children's book, but a very good one indeed. Strandloper If you liked him as a child, try this 1996 novel for adults which intertwines Aboriginal dreamtime and Old England.

No biography has won the overall Whitbread prize since 1991.</p> <p>Whitbread judges said it was a brave, compelling and rare book. \"This tragi-comic autobiographical story of one young woman's escape from a claustrophobic background in post-war Britain manages to tell the story of not just the author's family but of many others in stark, direct prose.\"</p> <p>For Matthew Kneale, 40, it was second time lucky. His colonialist parable The English Passengers was declared novel of the year, after being shortlisted for the Booker last autumn.</p> <p>The Whitbread judges praised The English Passengers as \"one of the most enjoyable books we've ever read for pure, unadulterated, page-turning excitement\".</p> <p>It was \"unquestionably\" the novel of the year for its historical depth, narrative control and masterly mix of tragedy and comedy, and for Kneale's remarkable ability to deal with complex historical truths \"without resorting to bogus hypocritical cant\".</p> <p>Kneale, whose novels have won smaller literary prizes, said from his home in Italy that the Whitbread award was \"a marvellous fillip\".</p> <p>The narrative of The English Passengers was prompted by the near-genocide caused by British colonisation of Tasmania in the 19th century, where \"all the original population and culture was lost within 40 years. Some colonists were aware of what was happening, but most Englishmen who went down there turned into monsters,\" he said.</p> <p>Whitbread's poet of the year is John Burnside for his seventh collection, The Asylum Dance, which the judges felt had stunning unity of tone, style and purpose.</p> <p>\"It constantly strives to evoke what is beyond the sayable. It is a deeply spiritual book while at the same time very physical, filled with a wide humanity. Burnside's poems are a sensory delight with an epiphany on every page.\"</p> <p>Burnside, 45, born in Dunfermline and expelled from school in Northamptonshire for smoking pot \"and other improprieties\", gave up computer programming five years ago to write poetry full time. and is now Dundee University's writer in residence. Yesterday, he said the title poem was inspired partly by Eduard Munk's painting The Dance of Life.</p> <p>Lorna Sage, 57, professor of English at East Anglia and veteran literary reviewer, was \"thrilled, astonished and surprised\" but too ill with a chest infection to say more last night.</p> <p>Bad Blood, one of the highest praised books of 2000, astonished and impressed those outside her immediate circle with its account of growing up in \"rural dereliction\".</p> <p>Her publishing editor Nicholas Pearson said, \"No-one knew very much about Lorna. It was a departure for her to write about herself. We find the book appeals to a much younger generation than her own\".</p>",

Whitbread judges said it was a brave, compelling and rare book. \"This tragi-comic autobiographical story of one young woman's escape from a claustrophobic background in post-war Britain manages to tell the story of not just the author's family but of many others in stark, direct prose.\" For Matthew Kneale, 40, it was second time lucky. His colonialist parable The English Passengers was declared novel of the year, after being shortlisted for the Booker last autumn. The Whitbread judges praised The English Passengers as \"one of the most enjoyable books we've ever read for pure, unadulterated, page-turning excitement\". It was \"unquestionably\" the novel of the year for its historical depth, narrative control and masterly mix of tragedy and comedy, and for Kneale's remarkable ability to deal with complex historical truths \"without resorting to bogus hypocritical cant\". Kneale, whose novels have won smaller literary prizes, said from his home in Italy that the Whitbread award was \"a marvellous fillip\". The narrative of The English Passengers was prompted by the near-genocide caused by British colonisation of Tasmania in the 19th century, where \"all the original population and culture was lost within 40 years. Some colonists were aware of what was happening, but most Englishmen who went down there turned into monsters,\" he said. Whitbread's poet of the year is John Burnside for his seventh collection, The Asylum Dance, which the judges felt had stunning unity of tone, style and purpose. \"It constantly strives to evoke what is beyond the sayable. It is a deeply spiritual book while at the same time very physical, filled with a wide humanity. Burnside's poems are a sensory delight with an epiphany on every page.\" Burnside, 45, born in Dunfermline and expelled from school in Northamptonshire for smoking pot \"and other improprieties\", gave up computer programming five years ago to write poetry full time. and is now Dundee University's writer in residence. Yesterday, he said the title poem was inspired partly by Eduard Munk's painting The Dance of Life. Lorna Sage, 57, professor of English at East Anglia and veteran literary reviewer, was \"thrilled, astonished and surprised\" but too ill with a chest infection to say more last night. Bad Blood, one of the highest praised books of 2000, astonished and impressed those outside her immediate circle with its account of growing up in \"rural dereliction\". Her publishing editor Nicholas Pearson said, \"No-one knew very much about Lorna. It was a departure for her to write about herself. We find the book appeals to a much younger generation than her own\".",

      "body": "<p>French human rights activists claimed victory yesterday after the giant US-based internet portal, Yahoo!, suddenly decided to halt its online auctions of Nazi memorabilia and other hate-related artifacts. </p> <p>\"I believe we have won the battle,\" Licra spokesman Marc Knoble said. Licra was one of three Jewish and anti-racist groups that sued Yahoo! in April for its internet auctions of items such as SS daggers, swastikas, propaganda films, photos of death camp victims and even replicas of Zyklon B canisters, the deadly gas used in Nazi concentration camps. </p> <p>Yahoo! said on Tuesday that it would ban sales of Nazi and Ku Klux Klan paraphernalia from all its websites from January 10, saying it did not want to profit from items that glorified or promoted hatred. The outlawed items join a list which includes cigarettes, live animals and used underwear. </p> <p>The company denied its decision was in response to an earlier Paris court ruling on the case, saying it was responding to users who had requested a more active policy for its site's content, and to groups such as the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and the Anti-Defamation League, which had been in talks with Yahoo! throughout the year. </p> <p>To enforce its new policy, Yahoo! has launched a monitoring programme that will screen new listings for offensive content, holding back potentially outlawed material for closer review by staff. </p> <p>Earlier this year a French court found that the material on Yahoo!'s US auction sites, which are easily accessible to French users, broke French laws against the sale or promotion of racist material. The sites, the court found, represented \"an apology for Nazism and a contestation of Nazi crimes\", and \"offended against France's collective memory\". </p> <p>In November the court confirmed that verdict, rejecting Yahoo!'s appeal. It gave the company three months to set up a filtering system that would prevent web-surfers in France from accessing the auctions. </p> <p>Yahoo! argued that the websites were aimed primarily at the American market and were therefore protected by the US constitution's first amendment, which governs freedom of speech. </p> <p>Amid alarm in some circles at what was seen as an attempt to impose national views on the quintessentially international, boundary-free internet, Yahoo! promised to fight the French ruling in US courts. It also argued that it would be technically difficult, if not impossible, to \"filter\" surfers of a particular nationality. </p> <p>Michael Traynor, a leading American multimedia lawyer who filed an affidavit on behalf of Yahoo!, said the Paris ruling had allowed France to \"extra-territorially enforce its notions on the rest of the world\". </p> <p>The French human-rights groups, however, said Yahoo!'s decision vindicated their position. \"I am very satisfied. We did not expect this. It goes beyond what we asked for,\" Mr Knoble said. \"Yahoo! recognises that we were right, that they should not be allowing hate auctions on their websites.\" </p> <p>Ygal El Harrar, the chairman of the Jewish students' group, UEJF, said it was a great victory. \"Basically, economic might puts no one above the law or above morality,\" he said. \"We welcome the American company's return to its senses.\" </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://auctions.yahoo.com\">Yahoo! auctions</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\">eBay</a> <br> <a href=\"http://s1.amazon.co.uk/exec/varzea/subst/home/home.html/026-2494085-8316468>Amazon UK auctions</a> </p><p><strong>Related stories:</strong><br />  <a href=\" http: www.guardianunlimited.co.uk internetnews story 0,7369,402148,00.html\">November 24: Internet giving hate groups new lease of life, watchdog says</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/internetnews/story/0,7369,400494,00.html\">November 20: Landmark ruling against Yahoo! in auction case</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,353264,00.html\">The issue explained: regulating the net</a></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>YOU CAN'T BEAT A BIT OF LIT</strong></p> <p>Gerard Houllier is not a man given to hyperbole. So when he announced that he'd made \"one of the most exciting signings\" in Liverpool's history today - and that man turned out to be Barcelona's so-out-of-favour-he-hasn't-even-been-on-the-bench forward Jari Litmanen - the Fiver couldn't help feeling a tad confused. And our confusion quickly turned into downright cynicism when a joyous Houllier added: \"He comes with a reputation which needs no improvement.\" </p> <p>A reputation for being a fancy-boy who won't like it up him come February, we thought. But then we looked at his record. Litmanen averages nearly a goal every other game. He's the all-time leading scorer in Big Cup. He's even been voted the Finnish footballer of the year five times - and that means a lot more than it used to. So it seems it wasn't such a bad idea to sign Rigobert Song, Djimi Triore and Bernard Dio er, hold on to sell Erik Meijer and Titi Camara after all.</p> <p>New team-mate Sami Hyppia certainly thinks the purchase of Litmanen is good business. \"There is not a question you can ask Jari about Liverpool that he will not know the answer to,\" he beamed. \"He knows everything about the club and is always talking about Liverpool.\" Hyypia's happiness might even spread to Robbie Fowler, after Houllier insisted this afternoon that he has bought Litmanen to complement, and not replace, his current strikers. All of which means Robbie can stay, the Wonder Bar will continue to thrive, and Liverpool will win the Premiership next season. Doesn't it?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ARRY HITS THE SALES</strong></p> <p>Appy Arry Redknapp didn't get to the top without being organised. In his portakabin round the back of Upton Park, he has a tray marked \"wheeling\" and a tray marked \"dealing\". Every potential transfer steal goes into one of these trays (some of them even go into two!) and that way Arry stays ahead of the game. That, and giving Slippy Mickey a monkey every fortnight for the latest gossip, that is.</p> <p>At the top of Arry's wheeling tray is Aston Villa skipper and feared midfield playmaker Gareth Southgate. Gareth has spent the season playing like a lion and looking like a lemon after his \"Villa quit bid\" stirred as much interest as Ross Kemp's Christmas Carol. Sniffing a bargain, Arry has now stepped in, and revealed a \u00a36m bid. \"Villa's asking price of \u00a310m for a player of 30 is way too high\", he said. \"But I rate Gareth highly, both as a player and a professional, and it's time we put in an offer.\"</p> <p>Arry is wise to keep this bid in the \"wheeling\" tray, as there is surely six months of rejection, haggling, and bids mysteriously disappearing into tracksuit trousers stylishly tucked into white socks to follow. But Arry's pursuit of Lorenzo \"I'll just swing a leg at it\" Amoruso is a different matter entirely, and only this morning moved to the top of the \"dealing\" pile. \"Something is on. If the deal goes through and everyone can be happy, I can definitely move [to Upton Park]\", Tthe non-racist centre-half admitted today. Arry agreed and, with his poker face on, said: \"I wouldn't mind having both Southgate and Amoruso at Upton Park.\"</p> <p>We bet you wouldn't.

      "trailText": "<p>As well as publishing test reports, the Good Housekeeping Institute answers readers' queries. Here are the five questions most often asked about hairdryers.  </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> <strong> 1. What is most important - watts or weight?</strong> </p> <p> Weight and balance matter more than wattage. So does your hair type: there's no point paying more for a dryer with a diffuser, for example, if you have short, straight hair. If your hair needs styling into position whenever you wash it, choose a dryer with a cool setting or a separate cool-shot button: damp, warm hair is still pliable and won't hold its shape without a concentrated burst of cool air to fix the style in place. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Do I need a diffuser or a volumiser?</strong> </p> <p> Diffusers are a useful way of drying naturally wavy or permed hair without damage. Used on low speed and heat settings, the diffuser's perforations and hollow prongs help spread heat evenly and gently (the dome shape also helps to contain curls and stop them blowing about). Volumiser attachments have longer prongs to lift your hair, adding extra body or texture to finer hair. They can take practice, and you may find the prongs uncomfortable. </p> <p> <strong> 3.

Alternatively use a diffuser to tease the hair into waves or curls. To give fine flyaway hair more volume, dry it with your head upside down, using a volumiser attachment. Direct the airflow towards the roots for maximum lift. When your hair is dry, toss your head back and brush into place. For natural-look waves, try grasping your hair at the roots and scrunching it between your fingers while drying. </p> <p>Next month's product test will be published on February 1.

      "bodyText": "1. What is most important - watts or weight? Weight and balance matter more than wattage. So does your hair type: there's no point paying more for a dryer with a diffuser, for example, if you have short, straight hair. If your hair needs styling into position whenever you wash it, choose a dryer with a cool setting or a separate cool-shot button: damp, warm hair is still pliable and won't hold its shape without a concentrated burst of cool air to fix the style in place. 2. Do I need a diffuser or a volumiser? Diffusers are a useful way of drying naturally wavy or permed hair without damage. Used on low speed and heat settings, the diffuser's perforations and hollow prongs help spread heat evenly and gently (the dome shape also helps to contain curls and stop them blowing about). Volumiser attachments have longer prongs to lift your hair, adding extra body or texture to finer hair. They can take practice, and you may find the prongs uncomfortable. 3. Are separate speed and temperature controls worth having? Yes, because they give you greater control over the temperature, and more flexibility if you want to share your dryer with someone with a different type or length of hair. Short, layered hair needs a low speed with a higher temperature; someone with long, straight hair is likely to want it to dry quickly, using a fast speed and high temperature. 4.

      "body": "<p>A large \"professional\"-style hairdryer can achieve superb results in the hands of a good hairdresser; using your own, however, is just as likely to result in arm ache and disappointment. In fact, if you have an easy-care haircut and just want to rough-style your hair, a basic short-snout dryer will do a good job for \u00a315 or less - at a third of the size and half the weight. At that price, you'll find simple combined heat and speed settings, rather than the greater range of temperature and air-flow options available on the dearer models. </p> <p>For hair that needs coaxing into shape, smoothness, volume or crisper curls, you will need to spend at least \u00a320 - for useful style-setting attachments like a concentrator nozzle with a narrow outlet, a diffuser, a cool-shot button, or even Velcro rollers (yes, honestly) or vibrating \"fingers\" - and be prepared for a little weightlifting. </p> <p>In our latest collaboration with the Good Housekeeping Institute, we tell you which dryers are worth their weight. </p> <p> <strong> The test</strong> </p> <p> The GHI put 27 hairdryers currently on the market through a series of tests. Testers measured the air temperature produced at each heat setting; those that reached 80 C and higher were eliminated (80 C is the point at which hair starts to suffer heat damage). Noise, weight and balance were also assessed. Finally, a panel of volunteers with different hair types and styles tried out the dryers and the nozzles and attachments that came with them, rating them for comfort, ease of use, and the finished results. </p> <p> <strong> The shortlist</strong> </p> <p> The hairdryers tested were weighed without any attachments fitted. All the selected hairdryers come with a concentrator nozzle; other attachments and other extras included are listed. All come with a guarantee of at least 12 months. </p> <p> <strong>More than \u00a325</strong></p> <p> <strong> Braun Sensation</strong> </p> <p> \u00a32 9.99.

      "body": "<p>The United States last night acted to boost a flagging American economy and head off the threat of a global recession by slashing interest rates for the first time in two years in a move which stunned financial markets. </p> <p>With confidence collapsing in the wake of last year's surge in the oil price and falling hi-tech share prices, the US Federal Reserve, led by Alan Greenspan, grasped the initiative by cutting the cost of borrowing by half a percentage point to 6% to bolster consumer and business sentiment.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by president-elect George W. Bush, although he said further action would be needed to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>City analysts believe the decision could lead to the first UK interest rate cut since last February. The bank's monetary policy committee meets next week and has been facing calls from industry leaders to cut the current 6% level.</p> <p>Neil Parker, market strategist for the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"This is only going to heighten expectations of interest rate cuts in the UK.

      "bodyText": "The United States last night acted to boost a flagging American economy and head off the threat of a global recession by slashing interest rates for the first time in two years in a move which stunned financial markets. With confidence collapsing in the wake of last year's surge in the oil price and falling hi-tech share prices, the US Federal Reserve, led by Alan Greenspan, grasped the initiative by cutting the cost of borrowing by half a percentage point to 6% to bolster consumer and business sentiment. The move was welcomed by president-elect George W. Bush, although he said further action would be needed to stimulate the economy. City analysts believe the decision could lead to the first UK interest rate cut since last February. The bank's monetary policy committee meets next week and has been facing calls from industry leaders to cut the current 6% level. Neil Parker, market strategist for the Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"This is only going to heighten expectations of interest rate cuts in the UK. I am sure the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will be surprised by this.\" Justin Urquhart-Stewart, of Barclays Stockbrokers in London, said the move could have a negative effect. He said: \"This is not Greenspan this is Greenpanic.\" He said he feared a whiff of deflation in the Fed move - deep concern that the market might shrug off the rate cut and that the economy would still weaken. The US rate cut triggered a rally of America's technology-heavy Nasdaq share price index which initially soared by 11%. The Dow Jones industrials index, which reflects the fortunes of so-called old economy stocks, rose 2% and the dollar pared losses against the resurgent euro. The cut, announced after an emergency session in Washington, came as a big surprise in global financial markets, which had not been expecting a rate cut until the end of the month, at the Fed's next scheduled meeting. The last time the Fed changed rates between timetabled meetings was in September 1998, when the global economy was in danger of being dragged into recession by the fall-out from the Asian financial crisis. Analysts said the Fed's prompt action was an indication of the seriousness of the rapidly deteriorating situation in the US, which accounts for 25% of the world economy. In the UK, two members of the bank's nine-person mone tary policy committee - Sushil Wadhwani and DeAnne Julius - have already begun voting for lower UK interest rates, arguing that the danger from the global slowdown in growth far outweighs domestic inflationary pressure. Speaking before the US decision, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, denied US rate cuts would automatically be followed by a similar UK move. The Fed's announcement that it was lowering its key federal funds lending rate was issued halfway through an economic forum being held in Texas by the president-elect. Mr Bush called it a bold action, as did the head of General Electric, Jack Welch, one of a number of prominent businessmen at the summit. Mr Bush said: \"We have got to be mindful of the warning signs and today Alan Greenspan showed he was.\" However, the president-elect continued to stress the need for his significant tax-cutting proposals and urged Congress to take a \"bold step\". Mr Bush said his specially convened meeting had been dominated by talks of a slowing economy. \"The warning signs are real, people's bottom lines are being affected. Talking to people here it is clear that a rate reduction of half a per cent is not enough.\" Explaining its decision in a formal statement, the Fed noted that inflation was under control and said that it had decided to act \"in the light of further weakening of sales and production, and in the context of lower consumer confidence, tight conditions in some segments of financial markets and high energy prices sapping household and business purchasing power.\" Figures published on Tuesday showed US manufacturing suffering the worst conditions since April 1991 when the US economy was emerging from recession.",

Not just one person, not the rotten apple in the barrel, but each infecting the other.</p> <p>\"If they, the police, are losing their morale still, if they are still being shot away by it, that's because they ought to be rightly ashamed of what happened during the case.</p> <p>\"It was primarily inefficiency and lack of proper control, but also infected by racism. That is what is at the root of it all. I could have bottled out. I could have decided not to mention racism at all and stuck to the policing questions.</p> <p>\"But as this procession of coppers came in, our mouths sort of fell open, and we thought we are bloody well going to have the courage to say it all publicly.</p> <p>\"I get awful letters from people who say they are going to come and murder me, and that Enoch Powell was right, and that I ought to have said they all ought to be sent back.</p> <p>\"But what saddens me is the newspapers, because I hoped and believed they would be on the same side in getting the police to get it right for the future.\"</p> <p>Sir William said that unconscious racism was more dangerous in a way than out-and-out racism, \"because it just sort of happens, and it fouls up the atmosphere between those who are misunderstood by the police when the police won't react properly to them and so on\".</p> <p>When asked: \"Why are we racist?\", Sir William replied: \"How difficult to answer.

      "bodyText": "Sir William Macpherson disclosed today that he had received death threats over his controversial report on the Stephen Lawrence case, in which he accused the Metropolitan Police of \"institutional racism\". He is quoted in an interview in The Spectator magazine as saying the phrase was not his, that he hesitated before using it, and that he had expressly denied that every Metropolitan Police officer was racist. However, he insisted that it was the only way he could see to sum up what was clearly a systemic failure of policing in which unconsciously racist assumptions had played a part at several stages. He said: \"It was a collective failure, little groups of people. Not just one person, not the rotten apple in the barrel, but each infecting the other. \"If they, the police, are losing their morale still, if they are still being shot away by it, that's because they ought to be rightly ashamed of what happened during the case. \"It was primarily inefficiency and lack of proper control, but also infected by racism. That is what is at the root of it all. I could have bottled out. I could have decided not to mention racism at all and stuck to the policing questions. \"But as this procession of coppers came in, our mouths sort of fell open, and we thought we are bloody well going to have the courage to say it all publicly. \"I get awful letters from people who say they are going to come and murder me, and that Enoch Powell was right, and that I ought to have said they all ought to be sent back. \"But what saddens me is the newspapers, because I hoped and believed they would be on the same side in getting the police to get it right for the future.\" Sir William said that unconscious racism was more dangerous in a way than out-and-out racism, \"because it just sort of happens, and it fouls up the atmosphere between those who are misunderstood by the police when the police won't react properly to them and so on\". When asked: \"Why are we racist?\", Sir William replied: \"How difficult to answer. I suppose in the end we started in this country by being a totally white insular population and there is a resistance to the gradual arrival, and the spread of immigration.\" He went on: \"Asylum seekers are one thing, but there are a tremendous number of people who come in legitimately, and so lots more places are going to become like Leicester because they tend to settle in the same area. \"It's something that's got to be not confronted, but accepted, because you can't do anything about it.\" \u0095 The friend who saw Stephen Lawrence murdered today called on the home secretary, Jack Straw, to reverse his decision to reinstate a Metropolitan Police officer sacked for racism. He described Mr Straw's decision to reinstate Pc Steve Hutt - sacked for calling a 14-year-old boy a \"black bastard\" - as a \"concession to racism\". Duwayne Brooks, 25, was with 18-year-old Stephen when a white gang stabbed him to death in Eltham, south east London, in 1993. In a letter to Mr Straw today, he said the Macpherson report into the killing had sparked a backlash in the police - and the campaign which led to the reinstatement of Mr Hutt was part of this. Pc Hutt was sacked by the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, after he admitted shouting \"sit down, you black bastard\" during a struggle to arrest him. The decision was overturned by Mr Straw last month after thousands of police officers signed a petition demanding his reinstatement. The mother of the child also condemned the decision to sack him. Pc Hutt admitted he had made the comment in a \"moment of madness\". However, Mr Brooks said the campaign to reinstate the police officer was \"coded racism\". A home office spokeswoman said Mr Brooks' letter had been received this morning. \"We will be looking at it and responding in due course,\" she said.

      "body": "<p>Is he astonished to be telling me all this? I think he may be. But he's too enlivened by it all to stop. The impulse is the same one that drove him to dance with me. Yes, I thought, it's no longer writing Spooks that's the defiant rebound from humiliation; it's fucking Faunia. But there's more even than that driving him. There's the wish to let the brute out, let that force out\u0097for half an hour, for two hours, for whatever, to be freed into the natural thing. He was married a long time. He had kids. He was the dean at a college. For forty years he was doing what was necessary to do. He was busy, and the natural thing that is the brute was moved into a box. And now that box is opened. Being a dean, being a father, being a husband, being a scholar, a teacher, reading the books, giving the lectures, marking the papers, giving the grades, it's over. At seventy-one you're not the high-spirited, horny brute you were at twenty-six, of course. But the remnants of the brute, the remnants of the natural thing\u0097he is in touch now with the remnants. And he's happy as a result, he's grateful to be in touch with the remnants. He's more than happy\u0097he's thrilled, and he's bound, deeply bound to her already, because of the thrill. It's not family that's doing it\u0097biology has no use for him anymore. It's not family, it's not responsibility, it's not duty, it's not money, it's not a shared philosophy or the love of literature, it's not big discussions of great ideas. No, what binds him to her is the thrill. Tomorrow he develops cancer, and boom. But today he has this thrill. </p> <p> Why is he telling me? Because to be able to abandon oneself to this freely, someone has to know it. He's free to be abandoned, I thought, because there's nothing at stake. Because there is no future. Because he's seventy-one and she's thirty-four. He's in it not for learning, not for planning, but for adventure; he's in it as she is: for the ride. He's been given a lot of license by those thirty-seven years. An old man and, one last time, the sexual charge. What is more moving for anybody? </p> <p> \"Of course I have to ask,\" Coleman said, \"what she's doing with me. What is really going through her mind? An exciting new experience for her, to be with a man as old as her grandfather?\" </p> <p> \"I suppose there is that type of woman,\" I said, \"for whom it is an exciting experience. There's every other type, why shouldn't there be that type? Look, there is obviously a department somewhere, Coleman, a federal agency that deals with old men, and she comes from that agency.\" </p> <p> \"As a young guy,\" Coleman told me, \"I was never involved with ugly women. But in the navy I had a friend, Farriello, and ugly women were his specialty. Down at Norfolk, if we went to a dance at a church, if we went at night to the USO, Farriello made a beeline for the ugliest girl. When I laughed at him, he told me I didn't know what I was missing. They're frustrated, he told me. They're not as beautiful, he told me, as the empresses you choose, so they'll do whatever you want. Most men are stupid, he said, because they don't know this. They don't understand that if only you approach the ugliest woman, she is the one who is the most extraordinary. If you can open her up, that is. But if you succeed? If you succeed in opening her up, you don't know what to do first, she is vibrating so. And all because she's ugly. Because she is never chosen. Because she is in the corner when all the other girls dance. And that's what it's like to be an old man. To be like that ugly girl. To be in the corner at the dance.\" </p> <p> \"So Faunia's your Farriello.\" </p> <p> He smiled. \"More or less.\" </p> <p> \"Well, whatever else may be going on,\" I told him, \"thanks to Viagra you're no longer suffering the torture of writing that book.\" </p> <p> \"I think that's so,\" Coleman said. \"I think that's true. That stupid book. And did I tell you that Faunia can't read? I found this out when we drove up to Vermont one night for dinner. Couldn't read the menu. Tossed it aside. She has a way, when she wants to look properly contemptuous, of lifting just a half of her upper lip, lifting it a hair, and then speaking what's on her mind. Properly contemptuous, she says to the waitress, 'Whatever he has, ditto.'\" </p> <p> \"She went to school until she was fourteen. How come she can't read?\" </p> <p> \"The ability to read seems to have perished right along with the childhood when she learned how. I asked her how this could happen, but all she did was laugh. 'Easy,' she says. The good liberals down at Athena are trying to encourage her to enter a literacy program, but Faunia's not having it. 'And don't you try to teach me. Do anything you want with me, anything,' she told me that night, 'but don't pull that shit. Bad enough having to hear people speak. Start teaching me to read, force me into that, push reading on me, and it'll be you who push me over the edge.' All the way back from Vermont, I was silent, and so was she. Not until we reached the house did we utter a word to each other. 'You're not up to fucking somebody who can't read,' she said. 'You're going to drop me because I'm not a worthy, legitimate person who reads. You're going to say to me, 'Learn to read or go.' 'No,' I told her, 'I'm going to fuck you all the harder because you can't read.' 'Good,' she said, 'we understand each other. I don't do it like those literate girls and I don't want to be done to like them.' 'I'm going to fuck you,' I said, 'for just what you are.' 'That's the ticket,' she says. We were both laughing by then. Faunia's got the laugh of a barmaid who keeps a baseball bat at her feet in case of trouble, and so she was laughing that laugh of hers, that scrappy, I've-seen-it-all laugh\u0097you know, the coarse, easy laugh of the woman with a past\u0097and by then she's unzipping my fly. But she was right on the money about my having decided to give her up. All the way back from Vermont I was thinking exactly what she said I was thinking. But I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to impose my wonderful virtue on her. Or on myself. That's over. I know these things don't come without a cost. I know that there's no insurance you can buy on this. I know how the thing that's restoring you can wind up killing you. I know that every mistake that a man can make usually has a sexual accelerator. But right now I happen not to care. I wake up in the morning, there's a towel on the floor, there's baby oil on the bedside table. How did all that get there? Then I remember. Got there because I'm alive again. Because I'm back in the tornado. Because this is what it is with a capital isness. I'm not going to give her up, Nathan. I've started to call her Voluptas.\" </p> <p> As a result of surgery I had several years ago to remove my prostate-cancer surgery that, though successful, was not without the adverse aftereffects almost unavoidable in such operations because of nerve damage and internal scarring\u0097I've been left incontinent, and so, the first thing I did when I got home from Coleman's was to dispose of the absorbent cotton pad that I wear night and day, slipped inside the crotch of my underwear the way a hot dog lies in a roll. Because of the heat that evening, and because I wasn't going out to a public place or a social gathering, I'd tried to get by with ordinary cotton briefs pulled on over the pad instead of the plastic ones, and the result was that the urine had seeped through to my khaki trousers. I discovered when I got home that the trousers were discolored at the front and that I smelled a little\u0097the pads are treated, but there was, on this occasion, an odor. I'd been so engaged by Coleman and his story that I'd failed to monitor myself. All the while I was there, drinking a beer, dancing with him, attending to the clarity\u0097 the predictable rationality and descriptive clarity\u0097with which he worked to make less unsettling to himself this turn that life had taken, I hadn't gone off to check myself, as ordinarily I do during my waking hours, and so, what from time to time now happens to me happened that night. No, a mishap like this one doesn't throw me as much as it used to when, in the months after the surgery, I was first experimenting with the ways of handling the problem\u0097and when, of course, I was habituated to being a free and easy, dry and odorless adult possessing an adult's mastery of the body's elementary functions, someone who for some sixty years had gone about his everyday business unworried about the status of his underclothes. Yet I do suffer at least a pang of distress when I have to deal with something messier than the ordinary inconvenience that is now a part of my life, and I still despair to think that the contingency that virtually defines the infant state will never be alleviated. </p> <p> I was also left impotent by the surgery. The drug therapy that was practically brand\u0097new in the summer of 1998 and that had already, in its short time on the market, proved to be something like a miraculous elixir, restoring functional potency to many otherwise healthy, elderly men like Coleman, was of no use to me because of the extensive nerve damage done by the operation. For conditions like mine Viagra could do nothing, though even had it proved helpful, I don't believe I would have taken it. </p> <p> I want to make clear that it wasn't impotence that led me into a reclusive existence. To the contrary. I'd already been living and writing for some eighteen months in my two-room cabin up here in the Berkshires when, following a routine physical exam, I received a preliminary diagnosis of prostate cancer and, a month later, after the follow-up tests, went to Boston for the prostatectomy. My point is that by moving here I had altered deliberately my relationship to the sexual caterwaul, and not because the exhortations or, for that matter, my erections had been effectively weakened by time, but because I couldn't meet the costs of its clamoring anymore, could no longer marshal the wit, the strength, the patience, the illusion, the irony, the ardor, the egoism, the resilience\u0097or the toughness, or the shrewdness, or the falseness, the dissembling, the dual being, the erotic professionalism\u0097to deal with its array of misleading and contradictory meanings. As a result, I was able to lessen a little my postoperative shock at the prospect of permanent impotence by remembering that all the surgery had done was to make me hold to a renunciation to which I had already voluntarily submitted. The operation did no more than to enforce with finality a decision I'd come to on my own, under the pressure of a lifelong experience of entanglements but in a time of full, vigorous, and restless potency, when the venturesome masculine mania to repeat the act\u0097repeat it and repeat it and repeat it\u0097remained undeterred by physiological problems. </p> <p> It wasn't until Coleman told me about himself and his Voluptas that all the comforting delusions about the serenity achieved through enlightened resignation vanished, and I completely lost my equilibrium. Well into the morning I lay awake, powerless as a lunatic to control my thinking, hypnotized by the other couple and comparing them to my own washed-out state. I lay awake not even trying to prevent myself from mentally reconstructing the \"transgressive audacity\" Coleman was refusing to relinquish. And my having danced around like a harmless eunuch with this still vital, potent participant in the frenzy struck me now as anything but charming self-satire. </p> <p> How can one say, \"No, this isn't a part of life,\" since it always is? The contaminant of sex, the redeeming corruption that de-idealizes the species and keeps us everlastingly mindful of the matter we are. </p> <p> In the middle of the next week, Coleman got the anonymous letter, one sentence long, subject, predicate, and pointed modifiers boldly inscribed in a large hand across a single sheet of white typing paper, the twelve-word message, intended as an indictment, filling the sheet from top to bottom: Everyone knows you're sexually exploiting an abused, illiterate woman half your age. </p> <p> The writing on both the envelope and the letter was in red ballpoint ink. Despite the envelope's New York City postmark, Coleman recognized the handwriting immediately as that of the young French woman who'd been his department chair when he'd returned to teaching after stepping down from the deanship and who, later, had been among those most eager to have him exposed as a racist and reprimanded for the insult he had leveled at his absent black students. </p> <p> In his Spooks files, on several of the documents generated by his case, he found samples of handwriting that confirmed his identification of Professor Delphine Roux, of Languages and Literature, as the anonymous letter writer. Aside from her having printed rather than written in script the first couple of words, she hadn't made any effort that Coleman could see to put him off the trail by falsifying her hand. She might have begun with that intention but appeared to have abandoned it or forgotten about it after getting no further than \"Everyone knows.\" On the envelope, the French-born professor hadn't even bothered to eschew the telltale European sevens in Coleman's street address and zip code. This laxness, an odd disregard\u0097in an anonymous letter\u0097for concealing the signs of one's identity, might have been explained by some extreme emotional state she was in that hadn't allowed her to think through what she was doing before firing off the letter, except that it hadn't been posted locally\u0097and hastily\u0097but appeared from the postmark to have been transported some hundred and forty miles south before being mailed. Maybe she had figured that there was nothing distinctive or eccentric enough in her handwriting for him to be able to recognize it from his days as dean; maybe she had failed to remember the documents pertaining to his case, the notes of her two interviews with Tracy Cummings that she had passed on to the faculty investigating committee along with the final report that bore her signature. Perhaps she didn't realize that, at Coleman's request, the committee had provided him with a photocopy of her original notes and all the other data pertinent to the complaint against him. Or maybe she didn't care if he did determine who out there had uncovered his secret: maybe she wanted both to taunt him with the menacing aggressiveness of an anonymous indictment and, at the same time, to all but disclose that the indictment had been brought by someone now far from powerless. </p> <p> The afternoon Coleman called and asked me to come over to see the anonymous letter, all the samples of Delphine Roux's handwriting from the Spooks files were neatly laid out on the kitchen table, both the originals and copies of the originals that he'd already run off and on which he'd circled, in red, every stroke of the pen that he saw as replicating the strokes in the anonymous letter. Marked off mainly were letters in isolation\u0097a y, an s, an x, here a word\u0097ending e with a wide loop, here an e looking something like an i when nestled up against an adjacent d but more like a conventionally written e when preceding an r\u0097and, though the similarities in writing between the letter and the Spooks documents were noteworthy, it wasn't until he showed me where his full name appeared on the envelope and where it appeared in her interview notes with Tracy Cummings that it seemed to me indisputable that he had nailed the culprit who'd set out to nail him. Everyone knows you're sexually exploiting an abused, illiterate woman half your age. </p> <p> While I held the letter in my hand and as carefully as I could\u0097and as Coleman would have me do\u0097appraised the choice of words and their linear deployment as if they'd been composed not by Delphine Roux but by Emily Dickinson, Coleman explained to me that it was Faunia, out of that savage wisdom of hers, and not he who had sworn them both to the secrecy that Delphine Roux had somehow penetrated and was more or less threatening to expose. \"I don't want anybody butting in my life. All I want is a no-pressure bang once a week, on the sly, with a man who's been through it all and is nicely cooled out. Otherwise it's nobody's fucking business.\" </p> <p> The nobody Faunia turned out mostly to be referring to was Lester Farley, her ex-husband. Not that she'd been knocked around in her life by this man alone\u0097\"How could I be, being out there on my own since I was fourteen?\" When she was seventeen, for example, and down in Florida waitressing, the then-boyfriend not only beat her up and trashed her apartment, he stole her vibrator. \"That hurt,\" Faunia said. And always, the provocation was jealousy. She'd looked at another man the wrong way, she'd invited another man to look at her the wrong way, she hadn't explained convincingly where she'd been for the previous half hour, she'd spoken the wrong word, used the wrong intonation, signaled, unsubstantially, she thought, that she was an untrustworthy two-timing slut\u0097whatever the reason, whoever he might be would be over her swinging his fists and kicking his boots and Faunia would be screaming for her life. </p> <p> Lester Farley had sent her to the hospital twice in the year before their divorce, and as he was still living somewhere in the hills and, since the bankruptcy, working for the town road crew, and as there was no doubting that he was still crazy, she was as frightened for Coleman, she said, as she was for herself, should he ever discover what was going on. She suspected that why Smoky had so precipitously dumped her was because of some sort of run-in or brush he'd had with Les Farley\u0097because Les, a periodic stalker of his ex-wife, had somehow found out about her and her boss, even though Hollenbeck's trysting places were remarkably well hidden, tucked away in remote corners of old buildings that no one but the boss of the college physical plant could possibly know existed or have access to. Reckless as it might seem for Smoky to be recruiting girlfriends from his own custodial staff and then to be rendezvousing with them right on campus, he was otherwise as meticulous in the management of his sporting life as he was in his work for the college. With the same professional dispatch that could get the campus roads cleared of a blizzard in a matter of hours, he could, if need be, equally expeditiously rid himself of one of his girls. </p> <p> \"So what do I do?\" Coleman asked me. \"I wasn't against keeping this thing concealed even before I'd heard about the violent ex-husband. I knew that something like this was coming. Forget that I was once the dean where she now cleans the toilets. I'm seventy-one and she's thirty-four. I could count on that alone to do it, I was sure, and so, when she told me that it was nobody's business, I figured, She's taken it out of my hands. I don't even have to broach the subject. Play it like adultery? Fine with me. That's why we went for dinner up in Vermont. That's why if our paths cross at the post office, we don't even bother to say hello.\" </p> <p> \"Maybe somebody saw you in Vermont. Maybe somebody saw you driving together in your car.\" </p> <p> \"True\u0097that's probably what happened. That's all that could have happened. It might have been Farley himself who saw us. Christ, Nathan, I hadn't been on a date in almost fifty years\u0097I thought the restaurant . . . I'm an idiot.\" </p> <p> \"No, it wasn't idiocy. No, no\u0097you just got claustrophobic. Look,\" I said, \"Delphine Roux\u0097I won't pretend I understand why she should care so passionately who you are screwing in your retirement, but since we know that other people don't do well with somebody who fails at being conventional, let's assume that she is one of these other people. But you're not. You're free. A free and independent man. A free and independent old man. You lost plenty quitting that place, but what about what you've gained? It's no longer your job to enlighten anyone\u0097you said as much yourself. Nor is this a test of whether you can or cannot rid yourself of every last social inhibition. You may now be retired but you're a man who led virtually the whole of life within the bounds of the communal academic society\u0097if I read you right, this is a most unusual thing for you. Perhaps you never wanted Faunia to have happened. You may even believe that you shouldn't want her to have happened. But the strongest defenses are riddled with weakness, and so in slips the last thing in the world you expected. At seventy-one, there is Faunia; in 1998, there is Viagra; there once again is the all-but-forgotten thing. The enormous comfort. The crude power. The disorienting intensity. Out of nowhere, Coleman Silk's last great fling. For all we know, the last great last-minute fling. So the particulars of Faunia Farley's biography form an unlikely contrast to your own. So they don't conform to decency's fantasy blueprint for who should be in bed with a man of your years and your position\u0097if anyone should be. Did what resulted from your speaking the word 'spooks' conform to decency's blueprint? Did Iris's stroke conform to decency's blueprint? Ignore the inanely stupid letter. Why should you let it deter you?\" \"Anonymous inanely stupid letter,\" he said. \"Who has ever sent me an anonymous letter? Who capable of rational thought sends anyone an anonymous letter?\" </p> <p> \"Maybe it's a French thing,\" I said. \"Isn't there a lot of it in Balzac? In Stendhal? Aren't there anonymous letters in The Red and the Black?\" </p> <p> \"I don't remember.\" </p> <p> \"Look, for some reason everything you do must have ruthlessness as its explanation, and everything Delphine Roux does must have virtue as its explanation. Isn't mythology full of giants and monsters and snakes? By defining you as a monster, she defines herself as a heroine. This is her slaying of the monster. This is her revenge for your preying on the powerless. She's giving the whole thing mythological status.\" </p> <p> From the smile indulgently offered me, I saw that I wasn't making much headway by spinning off, even jokingly, a pre-Homeric interpretation of the anonymous indictment. \"You can't find in mythmaking,\" he told me, \"an explanation for her mental processes. She hasn't the imaginative resources for mythmaking. Her m\u00e9tier is the stories that the peasants tell to account for their misery. The evil eye. The casting of spells. I've cast a spell over Faunia. Her m\u00e9tier is folktales full of witches and wizards.\" </p> <p> We were enjoying ourselves now, and I realized that in my effort to distract him from his rampaging pique by arguing for the primacy of his pleasure, I had given a boost to his feeling for me\u0097and exposed mine for him. I was gushing and I knew it. I surprised myself with my eagerness to please, felt myself saying too much, explaining too much, overinvolved and overexcited in the way you are when you're a kid and you think you've found a soul mate in the new boy down the street and you feel yourself drawn by the force of the courtship and so act as you don't normally do and a lot more openly than you may even want to. But ever since he had banged on my door the day after Iris's death and proposed that I write Spooks for him, I had, without figuring or planning on it, fallen into a serious friendship with Coleman Silk. I wasn't paying attention to his predicament as merely a mental exercise. His difficulties mattered to me, and this despite my determination to concern myself, in whatever time I have left, with nothing but the daily demands of work, to be engrossed by nothing but solid work, in search of adventure nowhere else\u0097to have not even a life of my own to care about, let alone somebody else's. </p> <p> And I realized all this with some disappointment. Abnegation of society, abstention from distraction, a self-imposed separation from every last professional yearning and social delusion and cultural poison and alluring intimacy, a rigorous reclusion such as that practiced by religious devouts who immure themselves in caves or cells or isolated forest huts, is maintained on stuff more obdurate than I am made of. I had lasted alone just five years\u0097five years of reading and writing a few miles up Madamaska Mountain in a pleasant two-room cabin situated between a small pond at the back of my place and, through the scrub across the dirt road, a ten-acre marsh where the migrating Canada geese take shelter each evening and a patient blue heron does its solitary angling all summer long. The secret to living in the rush of the world with a minimum of pain is to get as many people as possible to string along with your delusions; the trick to living alone up here, away from all agitating entanglements, allurements, and expectations, apart especially from one's own intensity, is to organize the silence, to think of its mountaintop plenitude as capital, silence as wealth exponentially increasing. The encircling silence as your chosen source of advantage and your only intimate. The trick is to find sustenance in (Hawthorne again) \"the communications of a solitary mind with itself.\" The secret is to find sustenance in people like Hawthorne, in the wisdom of the brilliant deceased. </p> <p> It took time to face down the difficulties set by this choice, time and heronlike patience to subdue the longings for everything that had vanished, but after five years I'd become so skillful at surgically carving up my days that there was no longer an hour of the eventless existence I'd embraced that didn't have its importance to me. Its necessity. Its excitement even. I no longer indulged the pernicious wish for something else, and the last thing I thought I could endure again was the sustained company of someone else. The music I play after dinner is not a relief from the silence but something like its substantiation: listening to music for an hour or two every evening doesn't deprive me of the silence\u0097the music is the silence coming true. I swim for thirty minutes in my pond first thing every summer morning, and, for the rest of the year, after my morning of writing\u0097and so long as the snow doesn't make hiking impossible\u0097I'm out on the mountain trails for a couple of hours nearly every afternoon. There has been no recurrence of the cancer that cost me my prostate. Sixty-five, fit, well, working hard\u0097and I know the score. I have to know it. </p> <p> So why, then, having turned the experiment of radical seclusion into a rich, full solitary existence\u0097why, with no warning, should I be lonely? Lonely for what? What's gone is gone. There's no relaxing the rigor, no undoing the renunciations. Lonely for precisely what? Simple: for what I had developed an aversion to. For what I had turned my back on. For life. The entanglement with life. </p> <p> This was how Coleman became my friend and how I came out from under the stalwartness of living alone in my secluded house and dealing with the cancer blows. Coleman Silk danced me right back into life. First Athena College, then me\u0097here was a man who made things happen. Indeed, the dance that sealed our friendship was also what made his disaster my subject. And made his disguise my subject. And made the proper presentation of his secret my problem to solve. That was how I ceased being able to live apart from the turbulence and intensity that I had fled. I did no more than find a friend, and all the world's malice came rushing in. </p> <p> Later that afternoon, Coleman took me to meet Faunia at a small dairy farm six miles from his house, where she lived rent-free in exchange for sometimes doing the milking. The dairy operation, a few years old now, had been initiated by two divorced women, college-educated environmentalists, who'd each come from a New England farming family and who had pooled their resources\u0097pooled their young children as well, six children who, as the owners liked to tell their customers, weren't dependent on Sesame Street to learn where milk comes from\u0097to take on the almost impossible task of making a living by selling raw milk. It was a unique operation, nothing like what was going on at the big dairy farms, nothing impersonal or factorylike about it, a place that wouldn't seem like a dairy farm to most people these days. It was called Organic Livestock, and it produced and bottled the raw milk that could be found in local general stores and in some of the region's supermarkets and was available, at the farm, for steady customers who purchased three or more gallons a week. </p> <p> There were just eleven cows, purebred Jerseys, and each had an old-fashioned cow name rather than a numbered ear tag to identify it. Because their milk was not mixed with the milk of the huge herds that are injected with all sorts of chemicals, and because, uncompromised by pasteurization and unshattered by homogenization, the milk took on the tinge, even faintly the flavor, of whatever they were eating season by season\u0097feed that had been grown without the use of herbicides, pesticides, or chemical fertilizers\u0097and because their milk was richer in nutrients than blended milk, it was prized by the people around who tried to keep the family diet to whole rather than processed foods. The farm has a strong following particularly among the numerous people tucked away up here, the retired as well as those raising families, in flight from the pollutants, frustrations, and debasements of a big city. In the local weekly, a letter to the editor will regularly appear from someone who has recently found a better life out along these rural roads, and in reverent tones mention will be made of Organic Livestock milk, not simply as a tasty drink but as the embodiment of a freshening, sweetening country purity that their city-battered idealism requires. Words like \"goodness\" and \"soul\" crop up regularly in these published letters, as if downing a glass of Organic Livestock milk were no less a redemptive religious rite than a nutritional blessing. \"When we drink Organic Livestock milk, our body, soul, and spirit are getting nourished as a whole. Various organs in our body receive this wholeness and appreciate it in a way we may not perceive.\" Sentences like that, sentences with which otherwise sensible adults, liberated from whatever vexation had driven them from New York or Hartford or Boston, can spend a pleasant few minutes at the desk pretending that they are seven years old. </p> <p> Though Coleman probably used, all told, no more than the half cup of milk a day he poured over his morning cereal, he'd signed on with Organic Livestock as a three-gallon-a-week customer. Doing this allowed him to pick up his milk, fresh from the cow, right at the farm\u0097to drive his car in from the road and down the long tractor path to the barn. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Is he astonished to be telling me all this? I think he may be. But he's too enlivened by it all to stop. The impulse is the same one that drove him to dance with me. Yes, I thought, it's no longer writing Spooks that's the defiant rebound from humiliation; it's fucking Faunia. But there's more even than that driving him. There's the wish to let the brute out, let that force out\u0097for half an hour, for two hours, for whatever, to be freed into the natural thing. He was married a long time. He had kids. He was the dean at a college. For forty years he was doing what was necessary to do. He was busy, and the natural thing that is the brute was moved into a box. And now that box is opened. Being a dean, being a father, being a husband, being a scholar, a teacher, reading the books, giving the lectures, marking the papers, giving the grades, it's over. At seventy-one you're not the high-spirited, horny brute you were at twenty-six, of course. But the remnants of the brute, the remnants of the natural thing\u0097he is in touch now with the remnants. And he's happy as a result, he's grateful to be in touch with the remnants. He's more than happy\u0097he's thrilled, and he's bound, deeply bound to her already, because of the thrill. It's not family that's doing it\u0097biology has no use for him anymore. It's not family, it's not responsibility, it's not duty, it's not money, it's not a shared philosophy or the love of literature, it's not big discussions of great ideas. No, what binds him to her is the thrill. Tomorrow he develops cancer, and boom. But today he has this thrill. Why is he telling me? Because to be able to abandon oneself to this freely, someone has to know it. He's free to be abandoned, I thought, because there's nothing at stake. Because there is no future. Because he's seventy-one and she's thirty-four. He's in it not for learning, not for planning, but for adventure; he's in it as she is: for the ride. He's been given a lot of license by those thirty-seven years. An old man and, one last time, the sexual charge. What is more moving for anybody? \"Of course I have to ask,\" Coleman said, \"what she's doing with me. What is really going through her mind? An exciting new experience for her, to be with a man as old as her grandfather?\" \"I suppose there is that type of woman,\" I said, \"for whom it is an exciting experience. There's every other type, why shouldn't there be that type? Look, there is obviously a department somewhere, Coleman, a federal agency that deals with old men, and she comes from that agency.\" \"As a young guy,\" Coleman told me, \"I was never involved with ugly women. But in the navy I had a friend, Farriello, and ugly women were his specialty. Down at Norfolk, if we went to a dance at a church, if we went at night to the USO, Farriello made a beeline for the ugliest girl. When I laughed at him, he told me I didn't know what I was missing. They're frustrated, he told me. They're not as beautiful, he told me, as the empresses you choose, so they'll do whatever you want. Most men are stupid, he said, because they don't know this. They don't understand that if only you approach the ugliest woman, she is the one who is the most extraordinary. If you can open her up, that is. But if you succeed? If you succeed in opening her up, you don't know what to do first, she is vibrating so. And all because she's ugly. Because she is never chosen. Because she is in the corner when all the other girls dance. And that's what it's like to be an old man. To be like that ugly girl. To be in the corner at the dance.\" \"So Faunia's your Farriello.\" He smiled. \"More or less.\" \"Well, whatever else may be going on,\" I told him, \"thanks to Viagra you're no longer suffering the torture of writing that book.\" \"I think that's so,\" Coleman said. \"I think that's true. That stupid book. And did I tell you that Faunia can't read? I found this out when we drove up to Vermont one night for dinner. Couldn't read the menu. Tossed it aside. She has a way, when she wants to look properly contemptuous, of lifting just a half of her upper lip, lifting it a hair, and then speaking what's on her mind. Properly contemptuous, she says to the waitress, 'Whatever he has, ditto.'\" \"She went to school until she was fourteen. How come she can't read?\" \"The ability to read seems to have perished right along with the childhood when she learned how. I asked her how this could happen, but all she did was laugh. 'Easy,' she says. The good liberals down at Athena are trying to encourage her to enter a literacy program, but Faunia's not having it. 'And don't you try to teach me. Do anything you want with me, anything,' she told me that night, 'but don't pull that shit. Bad enough having to hear people speak. Start teaching me to read, force me into that, push reading on me, and it'll be you who push me over the edge.' All the way back from Vermont, I was silent, and so was she. Not until we reached the house did we utter a word to each other. 'You're not up to fucking somebody who can't read,' she said. 'You're going to drop me because I'm not a worthy, legitimate person who reads. You're going to say to me, 'Learn to read or go.' 'No,' I told her, 'I'm going to fuck you all the harder because you can't read.' 'Good,' she said, 'we understand each other. I don't do it like those literate girls and I don't want to be done to like them.' 'I'm going to fuck you,' I said, 'for just what you are.' 'That's the ticket,' she says. We were both laughing by then. Faunia's got the laugh of a barmaid who keeps a baseball bat at her feet in case of trouble, and so she was laughing that laugh of hers, that scrappy, I've-seen-it-all laugh\u0097you know, the coarse, easy laugh of the woman with a past\u0097and by then she's unzipping my fly. But she was right on the money about my having decided to give her up. All the way back from Vermont I was thinking exactly what she said I was thinking. But I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to impose my wonderful virtue on her. Or on myself. That's over. I know these things don't come without a cost. I know that there's no insurance you can buy on this. I know how the thing that's restoring you can wind up killing you. I know that every mistake that a man can make usually has a sexual accelerator. But right now I happen not to care. I wake up in the morning, there's a towel on the floor, there's baby oil on the bedside table. How did all that get there? Then I remember. Got there because I'm alive again. Because I'm back in the tornado. Because this is what it is with a capital isness. I'm not going to give her up, Nathan. I've started to call her Voluptas.\" As a result of surgery I had several years ago to remove my prostate-cancer surgery that, though successful, was not without the adverse aftereffects almost unavoidable in such operations because of nerve damage and internal scarring\u0097I've been left incontinent, and so, the first thing I did when I got home from Coleman's was to dispose of the absorbent cotton pad that I wear night and day, slipped inside the crotch of my underwear the way a hot dog lies in a roll. Because of the heat that evening, and because I wasn't going out to a public place or a social gathering, I'd tried to get by with ordinary cotton briefs pulled on over the pad instead of the plastic ones, and the result was that the urine had seeped through to my khaki trousers. I discovered when I got home that the trousers were discolored at the front and that I smelled a little\u0097the pads are treated, but there was, on this occasion, an odor. I'd been so engaged by Coleman and his story that I'd failed to monitor myself. All the while I was there, drinking a beer, dancing with him, attending to the clarity\u0097 the predictable rationality and descriptive clarity\u0097with which he worked to make less unsettling to himself this turn that life had taken, I hadn't gone off to check myself, as ordinarily I do during my waking hours, and so, what from time to time now happens to me happened that night. No, a mishap like this one doesn't throw me as much as it used to when, in the months after the surgery, I was first experimenting with the ways of handling the problem\u0097and when, of course, I was habituated to being a free and easy, dry and odorless adult possessing an adult's mastery of the body's elementary functions, someone who for some sixty years had gone about his everyday business unworried about the status of his underclothes. Yet I do suffer at least a pang of distress when I have to deal with something messier than the ordinary inconvenience that is now a part of my life, and I still despair to think that the contingency that virtually defines the infant state will never be alleviated. I was also left impotent by the surgery. The drug therapy that was practically brand\u0097new in the summer of 1998 and that had already, in its short time on the market, proved to be something like a miraculous elixir, restoring functional potency to many otherwise healthy, elderly men like Coleman, was of no use to me because of the extensive nerve damage done by the operation. For conditions like mine Viagra could do nothing, though even had it proved helpful, I don't believe I would have taken it. I want to make clear that it wasn't impotence that led me into a reclusive existence. To the contrary. I'd already been living and writing for some eighteen months in my two-room cabin up here in the Berkshires when, following a routine physical exam, I received a preliminary diagnosis of prostate cancer and, a month later, after the follow-up tests, went to Boston for the prostatectomy. My point is that by moving here I had altered deliberately my relationship to the sexual caterwaul, and not because the exhortations or, for that matter, my erections had been effectively weakened by time, but because I couldn't meet the costs of its clamoring anymore, could no longer marshal the wit, the strength, the patience, the illusion, the irony, the ardor, the egoism, the resilience\u0097or the toughness, or the shrewdness, or the falseness, the dissembling, the dual being, the erotic professionalism\u0097to deal with its array of misleading and contradictory meanings. As a result, I was able to lessen a little my postoperative shock at the prospect of permanent impotence by remembering that all the surgery had done was to make me hold to a renunciation to which I had already voluntarily submitted. The operation did no more than to enforce with finality a decision I'd come to on my own, under the pressure of a lifelong experience of entanglements but in a time of full, vigorous, and restless potency, when the venturesome masculine mania to repeat the act\u0097repeat it and repeat it and repeat it\u0097remained undeterred by physiological problems. It wasn't until Coleman told me about himself and his Voluptas that all the comforting delusions about the serenity achieved through enlightened resignation vanished, and I completely lost my equilibrium. Well into the morning I lay awake, powerless as a lunatic to control my thinking, hypnotized by the other couple and comparing them to my own washed-out state. I lay awake not even trying to prevent myself from mentally reconstructing the \"transgressive audacity\" Coleman was refusing to relinquish. And my having danced around like a harmless eunuch with this still vital, potent participant in the frenzy struck me now as anything but charming self-satire. How can one say, \"No, this isn't a part of life,\" since it always is? The contaminant of sex, the redeeming corruption that de-idealizes the species and keeps us everlastingly mindful of the matter we are. In the middle of the next week, Coleman got the anonymous letter, one sentence long, subject, predicate, and pointed modifiers boldly inscribed in a large hand across a single sheet of white typing paper, the twelve-word message, intended as an indictment, filling the sheet from top to bottom: Everyone knows you're sexually exploiting an abused, illiterate woman half your age. The writing on both the envelope and the letter was in red ballpoint ink. Despite the envelope's New York City postmark, Coleman recognized the handwriting immediately as that of the young French woman who'd been his department chair when he'd returned to teaching after stepping down from the deanship and who, later, had been among those most eager to have him exposed as a racist and reprimanded for the insult he had leveled at his absent black students. In his Spooks files, on several of the documents generated by his case, he found samples of handwriting that confirmed his identification of Professor Delphine Roux, of Languages and Literature, as the anonymous letter writer. Aside from her having printed rather than written in script the first couple of words, she hadn't made any effort that Coleman could see to put him off the trail by falsifying her hand. She might have begun with that intention but appeared to have abandoned it or forgotten about it after getting no further than \"Everyone knows.\" On the envelope, the French-born professor hadn't even bothered to eschew the telltale European sevens in Coleman's street address and zip code. This laxness, an odd disregard\u0097in an anonymous letter\u0097for concealing the signs of one's identity, might have been explained by some extreme emotional state she was in that hadn't allowed her to think through what she was doing before firing off the letter, except that it hadn't been posted locally\u0097and hastily\u0097but appeared from the postmark to have been transported some hundred and forty miles south before being mailed. Maybe she had figured that there was nothing distinctive or eccentric enough in her handwriting for him to be able to recognize it from his days as dean; maybe she had failed to remember the documents pertaining to his case, the notes of her two interviews with Tracy Cummings that she had passed on to the faculty investigating committee along with the final report that bore her signature. Perhaps she didn't realize that, at Coleman's request, the committee had provided him with a photocopy of her original notes and all the other data pertinent to the complaint against him. Or maybe she didn't care if he did determine who out there had uncovered his secret: maybe she wanted both to taunt him with the menacing aggressiveness of an anonymous indictment and, at the same time, to all but disclose that the indictment had been brought by someone now far from powerless. The afternoon Coleman called and asked me to come over to see the anonymous letter, all the samples of Delphine Roux's handwriting from the Spooks files were neatly laid out on the kitchen table, both the originals and copies of the originals that he'd already run off and on which he'd circled, in red, every stroke of the pen that he saw as replicating the strokes in the anonymous letter. Marked off mainly were letters in isolation\u0097a y, an s, an x, here a word\u0097ending e with a wide loop, here an e looking something like an i when nestled up against an adjacent d but more like a conventionally written e when preceding an r\u0097and, though the similarities in writing between the letter and the Spooks documents were noteworthy, it wasn't until he showed me where his full name appeared on the envelope and where it appeared in her interview notes with Tracy Cummings that it seemed to me indisputable that he had nailed the culprit who'd set out to nail him. Everyone knows you're sexually exploiting an abused, illiterate woman half your age. While I held the letter in my hand and as carefully as I could\u0097and as Coleman would have me do\u0097appraised the choice of words and their linear deployment as if they'd been composed not by Delphine Roux but by Emily Dickinson, Coleman explained to me that it was Faunia, out of that savage wisdom of hers, and not he who had sworn them both to the secrecy that Delphine Roux had somehow penetrated and was more or less threatening to expose. \"I don't want anybody butting in my life. All I want is a no-pressure bang once a week, on the sly, with a man who's been through it all and is nicely cooled out. Otherwise it's nobody's fucking business.\" The nobody Faunia turned out mostly to be referring to was Lester Farley, her ex-husband. Not that she'd been knocked around in her life by this man alone\u0097\"How could I be, being out there on my own since I was fourteen?\" When she was seventeen, for example, and down in Florida waitressing, the then-boyfriend not only beat her up and trashed her apartment, he stole her vibrator. \"That hurt,\" Faunia said. And always, the provocation was jealousy. She'd looked at another man the wrong way, she'd invited another man to look at her the wrong way, she hadn't explained convincingly where she'd been for the previous half hour, she'd spoken the wrong word, used the wrong intonation, signaled, unsubstantially, she thought, that she was an untrustworthy two-timing slut\u0097whatever the reason, whoever he might be would be over her swinging his fists and kicking his boots and Faunia would be screaming for her life. Lester Farley had sent her to the hospital twice in the year before their divorce, and as he was still living somewhere in the hills and, since the bankruptcy, working for the town road crew, and as there was no doubting that he was still crazy, she was as frightened for Coleman, she said, as she was for herself, should he ever discover what was going on. She suspected that why Smoky had so precipitously dumped her was because of some sort of run-in or brush he'd had with Les Farley\u0097because Les, a periodic stalker of his ex-wife, had somehow found out about her and her boss, even though Hollenbeck's trysting places were remarkably well hidden, tucked away in remote corners of old buildings that no one but the boss of the college physical plant could possibly know existed or have access to. Reckless as it might seem for Smoky to be recruiting girlfriends from his own custodial staff and then to be rendezvousing with them right on campus, he was otherwise as meticulous in the management of his sporting life as he was in his work for the college. With the same professional dispatch that could get the campus roads cleared of a blizzard in a matter of hours, he could, if need be, equally expeditiously rid himself of one of his girls. \"So what do I do?\" Coleman asked me. \"I wasn't against keeping this thing concealed even before I'd heard about the violent ex-husband. I knew that something like this was coming. Forget that I was once the dean where she now cleans the toilets. I'm seventy-one and she's thirty-four. I could count on that alone to do it, I was sure, and so, when she told me that it was nobody's business, I figured, She's taken it out of my hands. I don't even have to broach the subject. Play it like adultery? Fine with me. That's why we went for dinner up in Vermont. That's why if our paths cross at the post office, we don't even bother to say hello.\" \"Maybe somebody saw you in Vermont. Maybe somebody saw you driving together in your car.\" \"True\u0097that's probably what happened. That's all that could have happened. It might have been Farley himself who saw us. Christ, Nathan, I hadn't been on a date in almost fifty years\u0097I thought the restaurant . . . I'm an idiot.\" \"No, it wasn't idiocy. No, no\u0097you just got claustrophobic. Look,\" I said, \"Delphine Roux\u0097I won't pretend I understand why she should care so passionately who you are screwing in your retirement, but since we know that other people don't do well with somebody who fails at being conventional, let's assume that she is one of these other people. But you're not. You're free. A free and independent man. A free and independent old man. You lost plenty quitting that place, but what about what you've gained? It's no longer your job to enlighten anyone\u0097you said as much yourself. Nor is this a test of whether you can or cannot rid yourself of every last social inhibition. You may now be retired but you're a man who led virtually the whole of life within the bounds of the communal academic society\u0097if I read you right, this is a most unusual thing for you. Perhaps you never wanted Faunia to have happened. You may even believe that you shouldn't want her to have happened. But the strongest defenses are riddled with weakness, and so in slips the last thing in the world you expected. At seventy-one, there is Faunia; in 1998, there is Viagra; there once again is the all-but-forgotten thing. The enormous comfort. The crude power. The disorienting intensity. Out of nowhere, Coleman Silk's last great fling. For all we know, the last great last-minute fling. So the particulars of Faunia Farley's biography form an unlikely contrast to your own. So they don't conform to decency's fantasy blueprint for who should be in bed with a man of your years and your position\u0097if anyone should be. Did what resulted from your speaking the word 'spooks' conform to decency's blueprint? Did Iris's stroke conform to decency's blueprint? Ignore the inanely stupid letter. Why should you let it deter you?\" \"Anonymous inanely stupid letter,\" he said. \"Who has ever sent me an anonymous letter? Who capable of rational thought sends anyone an anonymous letter?\" \"Maybe it's a French thing,\" I said. \"Isn't there a lot of it in Balzac? In Stendhal? Aren't there anonymous letters in The Red and the Black?\" \"I don't remember.\" \"Look, for some reason everything you do must have ruthlessness as its explanation, and everything Delphine Roux does must have virtue as its explanation. Isn't mythology full of giants and monsters and snakes? By defining you as a monster, she defines herself as a heroine. This is her slaying of the monster. This is her revenge for your preying on the powerless. She's giving the whole thing mythological status.\" From the smile indulgently offered me, I saw that I wasn't making much headway by spinning off, even jokingly, a pre-Homeric interpretation of the anonymous indictment. \"You can't find in mythmaking,\" he told me, \"an explanation for her mental processes. She hasn't the imaginative resources for mythmaking. Her m\u00e9tier is the stories that the peasants tell to account for their misery. The evil eye. The casting of spells. I've cast a spell over Faunia. Her m\u00e9tier is folktales full of witches and wizards.\" We were enjoying ourselves now, and I realized that in my effort to distract him from his rampaging pique by arguing for the primacy of his pleasure, I had given a boost to his feeling for me\u0097and exposed mine for him. I was gushing and I knew it. I surprised myself with my eagerness to please, felt myself saying too much, explaining too much, overinvolved and overexcited in the way you are when you're a kid and you think you've found a soul mate in the new boy down the street and you feel yourself drawn by the force of the courtship and so act as you don't normally do and a lot more openly than you may even want to. But ever since he had banged on my door the day after Iris's death and proposed that I write Spooks for him, I had, without figuring or planning on it, fallen into a serious friendship with Coleman Silk. I wasn't paying attention to his predicament as merely a mental exercise. His difficulties mattered to me, and this despite my determination to concern myself, in whatever time I have left, with nothing but the daily demands of work, to be engrossed by nothing but solid work, in search of adventure nowhere else\u0097to have not even a life of my own to care about, let alone somebody else's. And I realized all this with some disappointment. Abnegation of society, abstention from distraction, a self-imposed separation from every last professional yearning and social delusion and cultural poison and alluring intimacy, a rigorous reclusion such as that practiced by religious devouts who immure themselves in caves or cells or isolated forest huts, is maintained on stuff more obdurate than I am made of. I had lasted alone just five years\u0097five years of reading and writing a few miles up Madamaska Mountain in a pleasant two-room cabin situated between a small pond at the back of my place and, through the scrub across the dirt road, a ten-acre marsh where the migrating Canada geese take shelter each evening and a patient blue heron does its solitary angling all summer long. The secret to living in the rush of the world with a minimum of pain is to get as many people as possible to string along with your delusions; the trick to living alone up here, away from all agitating entanglements, allurements, and expectations, apart especially from one's own intensity, is to organize the silence, to think of its mountaintop plenitude as capital, silence as wealth exponentially increasing. The encircling silence as your chosen source of advantage and your only intimate. The trick is to find sustenance in (Hawthorne again) \"the communications of a solitary mind with itself.\" The secret is to find sustenance in people like Hawthorne, in the wisdom of the brilliant deceased. It took time to face down the difficulties set by this choice, time and heronlike patience to subdue the longings for everything that had vanished, but after five years I'd become so skillful at surgically carving up my days that there was no longer an hour of the eventless existence I'd embraced that didn't have its importance to me. Its necessity. Its excitement even. I no longer indulged the pernicious wish for something else, and the last thing I thought I could endure again was the sustained company of someone else. The music I play after dinner is not a relief from the silence but something like its substantiation: listening to music for an hour or two every evening doesn't deprive me of the silence\u0097the music is the silence coming true. I swim for thirty minutes in my pond first thing every summer morning, and, for the rest of the year, after my morning of writing\u0097and so long as the snow doesn't make hiking impossible\u0097I'm out on the mountain trails for a couple of hours nearly every afternoon. There has been no recurrence of the cancer that cost me my prostate. Sixty-five, fit, well, working hard\u0097and I know the score. I have to know it. So why, then, having turned the experiment of radical seclusion into a rich, full solitary existence\u0097why, with no warning, should I be lonely? Lonely for what? What's gone is gone. There's no relaxing the rigor, no undoing the renunciations. Lonely for precisely what? Simple: for what I had developed an aversion to. For what I had turned my back on. For life. The entanglement with life. This was how Coleman became my friend and how I came out from under the stalwartness of living alone in my secluded house and dealing with the cancer blows. Coleman Silk danced me right back into life. First Athena College, then me\u0097here was a man who made things happen. Indeed, the dance that sealed our friendship was also what made his disaster my subject. And made his disguise my subject. And made the proper presentation of his secret my problem to solve. That was how I ceased being able to live apart from the turbulence and intensity that I had fled. I did no more than find a friend, and all the world's malice came rushing in. Later that afternoon, Coleman took me to meet Faunia at a small dairy farm six miles from his house, where she lived rent-free in exchange for sometimes doing the milking. The dairy operation, a few years old now, had been initiated by two divorced women, college-educated environmentalists, who'd each come from a New England farming family and who had pooled their resources\u0097pooled their young children as well, six children who, as the owners liked to tell their customers, weren't dependent on Sesame Street to learn where milk comes from\u0097to take on the almost impossible task of making a living by selling raw milk. It was a unique operation, nothing like what was going on at the big dairy farms, nothing impersonal or factorylike about it, a place that wouldn't seem like a dairy farm to most people these days. It was called Organic Livestock, and it produced and bottled the raw milk that could be found in local general stores and in some of the region's supermarkets and was available, at the farm, for steady customers who purchased three or more gallons a week. There were just eleven cows, purebred Jerseys, and each had an old-fashioned cow name rather than a numbered ear tag to identify it. Because their milk was not mixed with the milk of the huge herds that are injected with all sorts of chemicals, and because, uncompromised by pasteurization and unshattered by homogenization, the milk took on the tinge, even faintly the flavor, of whatever they were eating season by season\u0097feed that had been grown without the use of herbicides, pesticides, or chemical fertilizers\u0097and because their milk was richer in nutrients than blended milk, it was prized by the people around who tried to keep the family diet to whole rather than processed foods. The farm has a strong following particularly among the numerous people tucked away up here, the retired as well as those raising families, in flight from the pollutants, frustrations, and debasements of a big city. In the local weekly, a letter to the editor will regularly appear from someone who has recently found a better life out along these rural roads, and in reverent tones mention will be made of Organic Livestock milk, not simply as a tasty drink but as the embodiment of a freshening, sweetening country purity that their city-battered idealism requires. Words like \"goodness\" and \"soul\" crop up regularly in these published letters, as if downing a glass of Organic Livestock milk were no less a redemptive religious rite than a nutritional blessing. \"When we drink Organic Livestock milk, our body, soul, and spirit are getting nourished as a whole. Various organs in our body receive this wholeness and appreciate it in a way we may not perceive.\" Sentences like that, sentences with which otherwise sensible adults, liberated from whatever vexation had driven them from New York or Hartford or Boston, can spend a pleasant few minutes at the desk pretending that they are seven years old. Though Coleman probably used, all told, no more than the half cup of milk a day he poured over his morning cereal, he'd signed on with Organic Livestock as a three-gallon-a-week customer. Doing this allowed him to pick up his milk, fresh from the cow, right at the farm\u0097to drive his car in from the road and down the long tractor path to the barn.",

      "body": "<p> From the back pocket of his shorts, Coleman pulled the original envelope holding Steena's letter. He was still without a T-shirt, which now that we were out of the kitchen and on the porch I couldn't help but take note of\u0097it was a warm July night, but not that warm. He had never struck me before as a man whose considerable vanity extended also to his anatomy. But now there seemed to me to be something more than a mere at-homeness expressed in this exhibition of his body's suntanned surface. On display were the shoulders, arms, and chest of a smallish man still trim and attractive, a belly no longer flat, to be sure, but nothing that had gotten seriously out of hand\u0097altogether the physique of someone who would seem to have been a cunning and wily competitor at sports rather than an overpowering one. And all this had previously been concealed from me, because he was always shirted and also because of his having been so drastically consumed by his rage. </p> <p> Also previously concealed was the small, Popeye-ish, blue tattoo situated at the top of his right arm, just at the shoulder joining\u0097the words \"U.S. Navy\" inscribed between the hooklike arms of a shadowy little anchor and running along the hypotenuse of the deltoid muscle. A tiny symbol, if one were needed, of all the million circumstances of the other fellow's life, of that blizzard of details that constitute the confusion of a human biography\u0097a tiny symbol to remind me why our understanding of people must always be at best slightly wrong. </p> <p> \"Kept it? The letter? Still got it?\" I said. \"Must've been some letter.\" </p> <p> \"A killing letter. Something had happened to me that I hadn't understood until that letter. I was married, responsibly employed, we were going to have a child, and yet I hadn't understood that the Steenas were over. Got this letter and I realized that the serious things had really begun, the serious life dedicated to serious things. My father owned a saloon off Grove Street in East Orange. You're a Weequahic boy, you don't know East Orange. It was the poor end of town. He was one of those Jewish saloon keepers, they were all over Jersey and, of course, they all had ties to the Reinfelds and to the Mob\u0097they had to have, to survive the Mob. My father wasn't a roughneck but he was rough enough, and he wanted better for me. He dropped dead my last year of high school. I was the only child. The adored one. He wouldn't even let me work in his place when the types there began to entertain me. Everything in life, including the saloon\u0097 beginning with the saloon\u0097was always pushing me to be a serious student, and, back in those days, studying my high school Latin, taking advanced Latin, taking Greek, which was still part of the old-fashioned curriculum, the saloon keeper's kid couldn't have tried harder to be any more serious.\" </p> <p> There was some quick by-play between us and Coleman laid down his cards to show me his winning hand. As I started to deal, he resumed the story. I'd never heard it before. I'd never heard anything before other than how he'd come by his hatred for the college. </p> <p> \"Well,\" he said, \"once I'd fulfilled my father's dream and become an ultra-respectable college professor, I thought, as my father did, that the serious life would now never end. That it could never end once you had the credentials. But it ended, Nathan. 'Or are they spooks?' and I'm out on my ass. When Roberts was here he liked to tell people that my success as a dean flowed from learning my manners in a saloon. President Roberts with his upper-class pedigree liked that he had this barroom brawler parked just across the hall from him. In front of the old guard particularly, Roberts pretended to enjoy me for my background, though, as we know, Gentiles actually hate those stories about the Jews and their remarkable rise from the slums. Yes, there was a certain amount of mockery in Pierce Roberts, and even then, yes, when I think about it, starting even then . . .\" But here he reined himself in. Wouldn't go on with it. He was finished with the derangement of being the monarch deposed. The grievance that will never die is hereby declared dead. </p> <p> Back to Steena. Remembering Steena helps enormously. </p> <p> \"Met her in '48,\" he said. \"I was twenty-two, on the GI Bill at NYU, the navy behind me, and she was eighteen and only a few months in New York. Had some kind of job there and was going to college, too, but at night. Independent girl from Minnesota. Sure-of-herself girl, or seemed so. Danish on one side, Icelandic on the other. Quick. Smart. Pretty. Tall. Marvelously tall. That statuesque recumbency. Never forgotten it. With her for two years. Used to call her Voluptas. Psyche's daughter. The personification to the Romans of sensual pleasure.\" </p> <p> Now he put down his cards, picked up the envelope from where he'd dropped it beside the discard pile, and pulled out the letter. A typewritten letter a couple of pages long. \"We'd run into each other. I was in from Adelphi, in the city for the day, and there was Steena, about twenty-four, twenty-five by then. We stopped and spoke, and I told her my wife was pregnant, and she told me what she was doing, and then we kissed goodbye, and that was it. About a week later this letter came to me care of the college. It's dated. She dated it. Here\u0097'August 18, 1954.' 'Dear Coleman,' she says, 'I was very happy to see you in New York. Brief as our meeting was, after I saw you I felt an autumnal sadness, perhaps because the six years since we first met make it wrenchingly obvious how many days of my life are \"over.\" You look very good, and I'm glad you're happy. You were also very gentlemanly. You didn't swoop. Which is the one thing you did (or seemed to do) when I first met you and you rented the basement room on Sullivan Street. Do you remember yourself? You were incredibly good at swooping, almost like birds do when they fly over land or sea and spy something moving, something bursting with life, and dive down\u0097or zero in\u0097and seize upon it. I was astonished, when we met, by your flying energy. I remember being in your room the first time and, when I arrived, I sat in a chair, and you were walking around the room from place to place, occasionally stopping to perch on a stool or the couch. You had a ratty Salvation Army couch where you slept before we chipped in for The Mattress. You offered me a drink, which you handed to me while scrutinizing me with an air of incredible wonder and curiosity, as if it were some kind of miracle that I had hands and could hold a glass, or that I had a mouth which might drink from it, or that I had even materialized at all, in your room, a day after we'd met on the subway. You were talking, asking questions, sometimes answering questions, in a deadly serious and yet hilarious way, and I was trying very hard to talk also but conversation was not coming as easily to me. So there I was staring back at you, absorbing and understanding far more than I expected to understand. But I couldn't find words to speak to fill the space created by the fact that you seemed attracted to me and that I was attracted to you. I kept thinking, \"I'm not ready. I just arrived in this city. Not now. But I will be, with a little more time, a few more exchanged notes of conversation, if I can think what I wish to say.\" (\"Ready\" for what, I don't know. Not just making love. Ready to be.) But then you \"swooped,\" Coleman, nearly halfway across the room, to where I was sitting, and I was flabbergasted but delighted. It was too soon, but it wasn't.'\" </p> <p> He stopped reading when he heard, coming from the radio, the first bars of \"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\" being sung by Sinatra. \"I've got to dance,\" Coleman said. \"Want to dance?\" </p> <p> I laughed. No, this was not the savage, embittered, embattled avenger of Spooks, estranged from life and maddened by it\u0097this was not even another man. This was another soul. A boyish soul at that. I got a strong picture then, both from Steena's letter and from Coleman, shirtless, as he was reading it, of what Coleman Silk had once been like. Before becoming a revolutionary dean, before becoming a serious classics professor\u0097and long before becoming Athena's pariah\u0097 he had been not only a studious boy but a charming and seductive boy as well. Excited. Mischievous. A bit demonic even, a snub-nosed, goat-footed Pan. Once upon a time, before the serious things took over completely. </p> <p> \"After I hear the rest of the letter,\" I replied to the invitation to dance. \"Read me the rest of Steena's letter.\" </p> <p> \"Three months out of Minnesota when we met. Just went down into the subway and brought her up with me. Well,\" he said, \"that was 1948 for you,\" and he turned back to her letter. \"'I was quite taken with you,'\" he read, \"'but I was concerned you might find me too young, an uninteresting midwestern bland sort of girl, and besides, you were dating someone \"smart and nice and lovely\" already, though you added, with a sly smile, \"I don't believe she and I will get married.\" \"Why not?\" I asked. \"I may be getting bored,\" you answered, thereby ensuring that I would do anything I could think of not to bore you, including dropping out of contact, if necessary, so as to avoid the risk of becoming boring. Well, that's it. That's enough. I shouldn't even bother you. I promise I won't ever again. Take care. Take care. Take care. Take care. Very fondly, Steena.'\" </p> <p> \"Well,\" I said, \"that is 1948 for you.\" \"Come. Let's dance.\" \"But you mustn't sing into my ear.\" \"Come on. Get up.\" What the hell, I thought, we'll both be dead soon enough, and so I got up, and there on the porch Coleman Silk and I began to dance the fox trot together. He led, and, as best I could, I followed. I remembered that day he'd burst into my studio after making burial arrangements for Iris and, out of his mind with grief and rage, told me that I had to write for him the book about all the unbelievable absurdities of his case, culminating in the murder of his wife. One would have thought that never again would this man have a taste for the foolishness of life, that all that was playful in him and lighthearted had been destroyed and lost, right along with the career, the reputation, and the formidable wife. Maybe why it didn't even cross my mind to laugh and let him, if he wanted to, dance around the porch by himself, just laugh and enjoy myself watching him\u0097maybe why I gave him my hand and let him place his arm around my back and push me dreamily around that old bluestone floor was because I had been there that day when her corpse was still warm and seen what he'd looked like. </p> <p> \"I hope nobody from the volunteer fire department drives by,\" I said. </p> <p> \"Yeah,\" he said. \"We don't want anybody tapping me on the shoulder and asking, 'May I cut in?'\" </p> <p> On we danced. There was nothing overtly carnal in it, but because Coleman was wearing only his denim shorts and my hand rested easily on his warm back as if it were the back of a dog or a horse, it wasn't entirely a mocking act. There was a semi-serious sincerity in his guiding me about on the stone floor, not to mention a thoughtless delight in just being alive, accidentally and clownishly and for no reason alive\u0097the kind of delight you take as a child when you first learn to play a tune with a comb and toilet paper. </p> <p> It was when we sat down that Coleman told me about the woman. \"I'm having an affair, Nathan. I'm having an affair with a thirty-four-year-old woman. I can't tell you what it's done to me.\" </p> <p> \"We just finished dancing\u0097you don't have to.\" </p> <p> \"I thought I couldn't take any more of anything. But when this stuff comes back so late in life, out of nowhere, completely unexpected, even unwanted, comes back at you and there's nothing to dilute it with, when you're no longer striving on twenty-two fronts, no longer deep in the daily disorder . . . when it's just this . . .\" </p> <p> \"And when she's thirty-four.\" </p> <p> \"And ignitable. An ignitable woman. She's turned sex into a vice again.\" </p> <p> \"'La Belle Dame sans Merci hath thee in thrall.'\" </p> <p> \"Seems so. I say, 'What is it like for you with somebody seventy-one?' and she tells me, 'It's perfect with somebody seventy-one. He's set in his ways and he can't change. You know what he is. No surprises.'\" </p> <p> \"What's made her so wise?\" </p> <p> \"Surprises. Thirty-four years of savage surprises have given her wisdom. But it's a very narrow, antisocial wisdom. It's savage, too. It's the wisdom of somebody who expects nothing. That's her wisdom, and that's her dignity, but it's negative wisdom, and that's not the kind that keeps you on course day to day. This is a woman whose life's been trying to grind her down almost for as long as she's had life. Whatever she's learned comes from that.\" </p> <p> I thought, He's found somebody he can talk with . . . and then I thought, So have I. The moment a man starts to tell you about sex, he's telling you something about the two of you. Ninety percent of the time it doesn't happen, and probably it's as well it doesn't, though if you can't get a level of candor on sex and you choose to behave instead as if this isn't ever on your mind, the male friendship is incomplete. Most men never find such a friend. It's not common. But when it does happen, when two men find themselves in agreement about this essential part of being a man, unafraid of being judged, shamed, envied, or outdone, confident of not having the confidence betrayed, their human connection can be very strong and an unexpected intimacy results. This probably isn't usual for him, I was thinking, but because he'd come to me in his worst moment, full of the hatred that I'd watched poison him over the months, he feels the freedom of being with someone who's seen you through a terrible illness from the side of your bed. He feels not so much the urge to brag as the enormous relief of not having to keep something so bewilderingly new as his own rebirth totally to himself. </p> <p> \"Where did you find her?\" I asked. </p> <p> \"Why has she nothing?\" </p> <p> \"She had a husband. He beat her so badly she ended up in a coma. They had a dairy farm. He ran it so badly it went bankrupt. She had two children. A space heater tipped over, caught fire, and both children were asphyxiated. Aside from the ashes of the two children that she keeps in a canister under her bed, she owns nothing of value except an '83 Chevy. The only time I've seen her come close to crying was when she told me, 'I don't know what to do with the ashes.' Rural disaster has squeezed Faunia dry of even her tears. And she began life a rich, privileged kid. Brought up in a big sprawling house south of Boston. Fireplaces in the five bedrooms, the best antiques, heirloom china\u0097everything old and the best, the family included. She can be surprisingly well spoken if she wants to be. But she's dropped so far down the social ladder from so far up that by now she's a pretty mixed bag of verbal beans. Faunia's been exiled from the entitlement that should have been hers. Declassed. There's a real democratization to her suffering.\" </p> <p> \"What undid her?\" </p> <p> \"A stepfather undid her. Upper-bourgeois evil undid her. There was a divorce when she was five. The prosperous father caught the beautiful mother having an affair. The mother liked money, remarried money, and the rich stepfather wouldn't leave Faunia alone. Fondling her from the day he arrived. Couldn't stay away from her. This blond angelic child, fondling her, fingering her\u0097it's when he tried fucking her that she ran away. She was fourteen. The mother refused to believe her. They took her to a psychiatrist. Faunia told the psychiatrist what happened, and after ten sessions the psychiatrist too sided with the stepfather. 'Takes the side of those who pay him,' Faunia says. 'Just like everyone.' The mother had an affair with the psychiatrist afterward. That is the story, as she reports it, of what launched her into the life of a tough having to make her way on her own. Ran away from home, from high school, went down south, worked there, came back up this way, got whatever work she could, and at twenty married this farmer, older than herself, a dairy farmer, a Vietnam vet, thinking that if they worked hard and raised kids and made the farm work she could have a stable, ordinary life, even if the guy was on the dumb side. Especially if he was on the dumb side. She thought she might be better off being the one with the brains. She thought that was her advantage. She was wrong. All they had together was trouble. The farm failed. 'Jerk-off,' she tells me, 'bought one tractor too many.' And regularly beat her up. Beat her black and blue. You know what she presents as the high point of the marriage? The event she calls 'the great warm shit fight.' One evening they are in the barn after the milking arguing about something, and a cow next to her takes a big shit, and Faunia picks up a handful and flings it in Lester's face. He flings a handful back, and that's how it started. She said to me, 'The warm shit fight may have been the best time we had together.' At the end, they were covered with cow shit and roaring with laughter, and, after washing off with the hose in the barn, they went up to the house to fuck. But that was carrying a good thing too far. That wasn't one-hundredth of the fun of the fight. Fucking Lester wasn't ever fun\u0097according to Faunia, he didn't know how to do it. 'Too dumb even to fuck right.' When she tells me that I am the perfect man, I tell her that I see how that might seem so to her, coming to me after him.\" </p> <p> \"And fighting the Lesters of life with warm shit since she's fourteen has made her what at thirty-four,\" I asked, \"aside from savagely wise? Tough? Shrewd? Enraged? Crazy?\" </p> <p> \"The fighting life has made her tough, certainly sexually tough, but it hasn't made her crazy. At least I don't think so yet. Enraged? If it's there\u0097and why wouldn't it be?\u0097it's a furtive rage. Rage without the rage. And, for someone who seems to have lived entirely without luck, there's no lament in her\u0097none she shows to me, anyway. But as for shrewd, no. She says things sometimes that sound shrewd. She says, 'Maybe you ought to think of me as a companion of equal age who happens to look younger. I think that's where I'm at.' When I asked, 'What do you want from me?' she said, 'Some companionship. Maybe some knowledge. Sex. Pleasure. Don't worry. That's it.' When I told her once she was wise beyond her years, she told me, 'I'm dumb beyond my years.' She was sure smarter than Lester, but shrewd? No. Something in Faunia is permanently fourteen and as far as you can get from shrewd. She had an affair with her boss, the guy who hired her. Smoky Hollenbeck. I hired him\u0097guy who runs the college's physical plant. Smoky used to be a football star here. Back in the seventies I knew him as a student. Now he's a civil engineer. He hires Faunia for the custodial staff, and even while he's hiring her, she understands what's on his mind. The guy is attracted to her. He's locked into an unexciting marriage, but he's not angry with her about it\u0097he's not looking at her disdainfully, thinking, Why haven't you settled down, why are you still tramping and whoring around? No bourgeois superiority from Smoky. Smoky is doing all the right things and doing them beautifully\u0097a wife, kids, five kids, married as a man can be, a sports hero still around the college, popular and admired in town\u0097but he has a gift: he can also step outside of that. You wouldn't believe it to talk to him. Mr. Athena Square squared, performing in every single way he is supposed to perform. Appears to have bought into the story of himself one hundred percent. You would expect him to think, This stupid bitch with her fucked-up life? Get her the fuck out of my office. But he doesn't. Unlike everyone else in Athena, he is not so caught up in the legend of Smoky that he is incapable of thinking, Yeah, this is a real cunt I'd like to fuck. Or incapable of acting. He fucks her, Nathan. Gets Faunia in bed with him and another of the women from the custodial staff. Fucks 'em together. Goes on for six months. Then a real estate woman, newly divorced, fresh on the local scene, she joins the act. Smoky's circus. Smoky's secret three-ring circus. But then, after six months, he drops her\u0097takes Faunia out of the rotation and drops her. I knew nothing about any of this till she told me. And she only told me because one night in bed, her eyes roll back into her head and she calls me by his name. Whispers to me, 'Smoky.' On top of old Smoky. Her being with him in that m\u00e9nage gave me a better idea of the dame I was dealing with. Upped the ante. Gave me a jolt, actually\u0097this is no amateur. When I ask her how Smoky manages to attract his hordes, she tells me, 'By the force of his prick.' 'Explain,' I say, and she tells me, 'You know how when a real cunt walks into a room, a man knows it? Well, the same thing happens the other way round. With certain people, no matter what the disguise, you understand what they're there to do.' In bed is the only place where Faunia is in any way shrewd, Nathan. A spontaneous physical shrewdness plays the leading role in bed\u0097second lead played by transgressive audacity. In bed nothing escapes Faunia's attention. Her flesh has eyes. Her flesh sees everything. In bed she is a powerful, coherent, unified being whose pleasure is in overstepping the boundaries. In bed she is a deep phenomenon. Maybe that's a gift of the molestation. When we go downstairs to the kitchen, when I scramble some eggs and we sit there eating together, she's a kid. Maybe that's a gift of the molestation too. I am in the company of a blank-eyed, distracted, incoherent kid. This happens nowhere else. But whenever we eat, there it is: me and my kid. Seems to be all the daughter that's left in her. She can't sit up straight in her chair, she can't string two sentences together having anything to do with each other. All the seeming nonchalance about sex and tragedy, all of that disappears, and I'm sitting there wanting to say to her, 'Pull yourself up to the table, get the sleeve of my bathrobe out of your plate, try to listen to what I'm saying, and look at me, damn it, when you speak.'\" </p> <p> \"Do you say it?\" </p> <p> \"Doesn't seem advisable. No, I don't\u0097not as long as I prefer to preserve the intensity of what is there. I think of that canister under her bed, where she keeps the ashes she doesn't know what to do with, and I want to say, 'It's two years. It's time to bury them. If you can't put them in the ground, then go down to the river and shake out the ashes from the bridge. Let them float off. Let them go. I'll go do it with you. We'll do it together.'

      "bodyText": "From the back pocket of his shorts, Coleman pulled the original envelope holding Steena's letter. He was still without a T-shirt, which now that we were out of the kitchen and on the porch I couldn't help but take note of\u0097it was a warm July night, but not that warm. He had never struck me before as a man whose considerable vanity extended also to his anatomy. But now there seemed to me to be something more than a mere at-homeness expressed in this exhibition of his body's suntanned surface. On display were the shoulders, arms, and chest of a smallish man still trim and attractive, a belly no longer flat, to be sure, but nothing that had gotten seriously out of hand\u0097altogether the physique of someone who would seem to have been a cunning and wily competitor at sports rather than an overpowering one. And all this had previously been concealed from me, because he was always shirted and also because of his having been so drastically consumed by his rage. Also previously concealed was the small, Popeye-ish, blue tattoo situated at the top of his right arm, just at the shoulder joining\u0097the words \"U.S. Navy\" inscribed between the hooklike arms of a shadowy little anchor and running along the hypotenuse of the deltoid muscle. A tiny symbol, if one were needed, of all the million circumstances of the other fellow's life, of that blizzard of details that constitute the confusion of a human biography\u0097a tiny symbol to remind me why our understanding of people must always be at best slightly wrong. \"Kept it? The letter? Still got it?\" I said. \"Must've been some letter.\" \"A killing letter. Something had happened to me that I hadn't understood until that letter. I was married, responsibly employed, we were going to have a child, and yet I hadn't understood that the Steenas were over. Got this letter and I realized that the serious things had really begun, the serious life dedicated to serious things. My father owned a saloon off Grove Street in East Orange. You're a Weequahic boy, you don't know East Orange. It was the poor end of town. He was one of those Jewish saloon keepers, they were all over Jersey and, of course, they all had ties to the Reinfelds and to the Mob\u0097they had to have, to survive the Mob. My father wasn't a roughneck but he was rough enough, and he wanted better for me. He dropped dead my last year of high school. I was the only child. The adored one. He wouldn't even let me work in his place when the types there began to entertain me. Everything in life, including the saloon\u0097 beginning with the saloon\u0097was always pushing me to be a serious student, and, back in those days, studying my high school Latin, taking advanced Latin, taking Greek, which was still part of the old-fashioned curriculum, the saloon keeper's kid couldn't have tried harder to be any more serious.\" There was some quick by-play between us and Coleman laid down his cards to show me his winning hand. As I started to deal, he resumed the story. I'd never heard it before. I'd never heard anything before other than how he'd come by his hatred for the college. \"Well,\" he said, \"once I'd fulfilled my father's dream and become an ultra-respectable college professor, I thought, as my father did, that the serious life would now never end. That it could never end once you had the credentials. But it ended, Nathan. 'Or are they spooks?' and I'm out on my ass. When Roberts was here he liked to tell people that my success as a dean flowed from learning my manners in a saloon. President Roberts with his upper-class pedigree liked that he had this barroom brawler parked just across the hall from him. In front of the old guard particularly, Roberts pretended to enjoy me for my background, though, as we know, Gentiles actually hate those stories about the Jews and their remarkable rise from the slums. Yes, there was a certain amount of mockery in Pierce Roberts, and even then, yes, when I think about it, starting even then . . .\" But here he reined himself in. Wouldn't go on with it. He was finished with the derangement of being the monarch deposed. The grievance that will never die is hereby declared dead. Back to Steena. Remembering Steena helps enormously. \"Met her in '48,\" he said. \"I was twenty-two, on the GI Bill at NYU, the navy behind me, and she was eighteen and only a few months in New York. Had some kind of job there and was going to college, too, but at night. Independent girl from Minnesota. Sure-of-herself girl, or seemed so. Danish on one side, Icelandic on the other. Quick. Smart. Pretty. Tall. Marvelously tall. That statuesque recumbency. Never forgotten it. With her for two years. Used to call her Voluptas. Psyche's daughter. The personification to the Romans of sensual pleasure.\" Now he put down his cards, picked up the envelope from where he'd dropped it beside the discard pile, and pulled out the letter. A typewritten letter a couple of pages long. \"We'd run into each other. I was in from Adelphi, in the city for the day, and there was Steena, about twenty-four, twenty-five by then. We stopped and spoke, and I told her my wife was pregnant, and she told me what she was doing, and then we kissed goodbye, and that was it. About a week later this letter came to me care of the college. It's dated. She dated it. Here\u0097'August 18, 1954.' 'Dear Coleman,' she says, 'I was very happy to see you in New York. Brief as our meeting was, after I saw you I felt an autumnal sadness, perhaps because the six years since we first met make it wrenchingly obvious how many days of my life are \"over.\" You look very good, and I'm glad you're happy. You were also very gentlemanly. You didn't swoop. Which is the one thing you did (or seemed to do) when I first met you and you rented the basement room on Sullivan Street. Do you remember yourself? You were incredibly good at swooping, almost like birds do when they fly over land or sea and spy something moving, something bursting with life, and dive down\u0097or zero in\u0097and seize upon it. I was astonished, when we met, by your flying energy. I remember being in your room the first time and, when I arrived, I sat in a chair, and you were walking around the room from place to place, occasionally stopping to perch on a stool or the couch. You had a ratty Salvation Army couch where you slept before we chipped in for The Mattress. You offered me a drink, which you handed to me while scrutinizing me with an air of incredible wonder and curiosity, as if it were some kind of miracle that I had hands and could hold a glass, or that I had a mouth which might drink from it, or that I had even materialized at all, in your room, a day after we'd met on the subway. You were talking, asking questions, sometimes answering questions, in a deadly serious and yet hilarious way, and I was trying very hard to talk also but conversation was not coming as easily to me. So there I was staring back at you, absorbing and understanding far more than I expected to understand. But I couldn't find words to speak to fill the space created by the fact that you seemed attracted to me and that I was attracted to you. I kept thinking, \"I'm not ready. I just arrived in this city. Not now. But I will be, with a little more time, a few more exchanged notes of conversation, if I can think what I wish to say.\" (\"Ready\" for what, I don't know. Not just making love. Ready to be.) But then you \"swooped,\" Coleman, nearly halfway across the room, to where I was sitting, and I was flabbergasted but delighted. It was too soon, but it wasn't.'\" He stopped reading when he heard, coming from the radio, the first bars of \"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\" being sung by Sinatra. \"I've got to dance,\" Coleman said. \"Want to dance?\" I laughed. No, this was not the savage, embittered, embattled avenger of Spooks, estranged from life and maddened by it\u0097this was not even another man. This was another soul. A boyish soul at that. I got a strong picture then, both from Steena's letter and from Coleman, shirtless, as he was reading it, of what Coleman Silk had once been like. Before becoming a revolutionary dean, before becoming a serious classics professor\u0097and long before becoming Athena's pariah\u0097 he had been not only a studious boy but a charming and seductive boy as well. Excited. Mischievous. A bit demonic even, a snub-nosed, goat-footed Pan. Once upon a time, before the serious things took over completely. \"After I hear the rest of the letter,\" I replied to the invitation to dance. \"Read me the rest of Steena's letter.\" \"Three months out of Minnesota when we met. Just went down into the subway and brought her up with me. Well,\" he said, \"that was 1948 for you,\" and he turned back to her letter. \"'I was quite taken with you,'\" he read, \"'but I was concerned you might find me too young, an uninteresting midwestern bland sort of girl, and besides, you were dating someone \"smart and nice and lovely\" already, though you added, with a sly smile, \"I don't believe she and I will get married.\" \"Why not?\" I asked. \"I may be getting bored,\" you answered, thereby ensuring that I would do anything I could think of not to bore you, including dropping out of contact, if necessary, so as to avoid the risk of becoming boring. Well, that's it. That's enough. I shouldn't even bother you. I promise I won't ever again. Take care. Take care. Take care. Take care. Very fondly, Steena.'\" \"Well,\" I said, \"that is 1948 for you.\" \"Come. Let's dance.\" \"But you mustn't sing into my ear.\" \"Come on. Get up.\" What the hell, I thought, we'll both be dead soon enough, and so I got up, and there on the porch Coleman Silk and I began to dance the fox trot together. He led, and, as best I could, I followed. I remembered that day he'd burst into my studio after making burial arrangements for Iris and, out of his mind with grief and rage, told me that I had to write for him the book about all the unbelievable absurdities of his case, culminating in the murder of his wife. One would have thought that never again would this man have a taste for the foolishness of life, that all that was playful in him and lighthearted had been destroyed and lost, right along with the career, the reputation, and the formidable wife. Maybe why it didn't even cross my mind to laugh and let him, if he wanted to, dance around the porch by himself, just laugh and enjoy myself watching him\u0097maybe why I gave him my hand and let him place his arm around my back and push me dreamily around that old bluestone floor was because I had been there that day when her corpse was still warm and seen what he'd looked like. \"I hope nobody from the volunteer fire department drives by,\" I said. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"We don't want anybody tapping me on the shoulder and asking, 'May I cut in?'\" On we danced. There was nothing overtly carnal in it, but because Coleman was wearing only his denim shorts and my hand rested easily on his warm back as if it were the back of a dog or a horse, it wasn't entirely a mocking act. There was a semi-serious sincerity in his guiding me about on the stone floor, not to mention a thoughtless delight in just being alive, accidentally and clownishly and for no reason alive\u0097the kind of delight you take as a child when you first learn to play a tune with a comb and toilet paper. It was when we sat down that Coleman told me about the woman. \"I'm having an affair, Nathan. I'm having an affair with a thirty-four-year-old woman. I can't tell you what it's done to me.\" \"We just finished dancing\u0097you don't have to.\" \"I thought I couldn't take any more of anything. But when this stuff comes back so late in life, out of nowhere, completely unexpected, even unwanted, comes back at you and there's nothing to dilute it with, when you're no longer striving on twenty-two fronts, no longer deep in the daily disorder . . . when it's just this . . .\" \"And when she's thirty-four.\" \"And ignitable. An ignitable woman. She's turned sex into a vice again.\" \"'La Belle Dame sans Merci hath thee in thrall.'\" \"Seems so. I say, 'What is it like for you with somebody seventy-one?' and she tells me, 'It's perfect with somebody seventy-one. He's set in his ways and he can't change. You know what he is. No surprises.'\" \"What's made her so wise?\" \"Surprises. Thirty-four years of savage surprises have given her wisdom. But it's a very narrow, antisocial wisdom. It's savage, too. It's the wisdom of somebody who expects nothing. That's her wisdom, and that's her dignity, but it's negative wisdom, and that's not the kind that keeps you on course day to day. This is a woman whose life's been trying to grind her down almost for as long as she's had life. Whatever she's learned comes from that.\" I thought, He's found somebody he can talk with . . . and then I thought, So have I. The moment a man starts to tell you about sex, he's telling you something about the two of you. Ninety percent of the time it doesn't happen, and probably it's as well it doesn't, though if you can't get a level of candor on sex and you choose to behave instead as if this isn't ever on your mind, the male friendship is incomplete. Most men never find such a friend. It's not common. But when it does happen, when two men find themselves in agreement about this essential part of being a man, unafraid of being judged, shamed, envied, or outdone, confident of not having the confidence betrayed, their human connection can be very strong and an unexpected intimacy results. This probably isn't usual for him, I was thinking, but because he'd come to me in his worst moment, full of the hatred that I'd watched poison him over the months, he feels the freedom of being with someone who's seen you through a terrible illness from the side of your bed. He feels not so much the urge to brag as the enormous relief of not having to keep something so bewilderingly new as his own rebirth totally to himself. \"Where did you find her?\" I asked. \"Why has she nothing?\" \"She had a husband. He beat her so badly she ended up in a coma. They had a dairy farm. He ran it so badly it went bankrupt. She had two children. A space heater tipped over, caught fire, and both children were asphyxiated. Aside from the ashes of the two children that she keeps in a canister under her bed, she owns nothing of value except an '83 Chevy. The only time I've seen her come close to crying was when she told me, 'I don't know what to do with the ashes.' Rural disaster has squeezed Faunia dry of even her tears. And she began life a rich, privileged kid. Brought up in a big sprawling house south of Boston. Fireplaces in the five bedrooms, the best antiques, heirloom china\u0097everything old and the best, the family included. She can be surprisingly well spoken if she wants to be. But she's dropped so far down the social ladder from so far up that by now she's a pretty mixed bag of verbal beans. Faunia's been exiled from the entitlement that should have been hers. Declassed. There's a real democratization to her suffering.\" \"What undid her?\" \"A stepfather undid her. Upper-bourgeois evil undid her. There was a divorce when she was five. The prosperous father caught the beautiful mother having an affair. The mother liked money, remarried money, and the rich stepfather wouldn't leave Faunia alone. Fondling her from the day he arrived. Couldn't stay away from her. This blond angelic child, fondling her, fingering her\u0097it's when he tried fucking her that she ran away. She was fourteen. The mother refused to believe her. They took her to a psychiatrist. Faunia told the psychiatrist what happened, and after ten sessions the psychiatrist too sided with the stepfather. 'Takes the side of those who pay him,' Faunia says. 'Just like everyone.' The mother had an affair with the psychiatrist afterward. That is the story, as she reports it, of what launched her into the life of a tough having to make her way on her own. Ran away from home, from high school, went down south, worked there, came back up this way, got whatever work she could, and at twenty married this farmer, older than herself, a dairy farmer, a Vietnam vet, thinking that if they worked hard and raised kids and made the farm work she could have a stable, ordinary life, even if the guy was on the dumb side. Especially if he was on the dumb side. She thought she might be better off being the one with the brains. She thought that was her advantage. She was wrong. All they had together was trouble. The farm failed. 'Jerk-off,' she tells me, 'bought one tractor too many.' And regularly beat her up. Beat her black and blue. You know what she presents as the high point of the marriage? The event she calls 'the great warm shit fight.' One evening they are in the barn after the milking arguing about something, and a cow next to her takes a big shit, and Faunia picks up a handful and flings it in Lester's face. He flings a handful back, and that's how it started. She said to me, 'The warm shit fight may have been the best time we had together.' At the end, they were covered with cow shit and roaring with laughter, and, after washing off with the hose in the barn, they went up to the house to fuck. But that was carrying a good thing too far. That wasn't one-hundredth of the fun of the fight. Fucking Lester wasn't ever fun\u0097according to Faunia, he didn't know how to do it. 'Too dumb even to fuck right.' When she tells me that I am the perfect man, I tell her that I see how that might seem so to her, coming to me after him.\" \"And fighting the Lesters of life with warm shit since she's fourteen has made her what at thirty-four,\" I asked, \"aside from savagely wise? Tough? Shrewd? Enraged? Crazy?\" \"The fighting life has made her tough, certainly sexually tough, but it hasn't made her crazy. At least I don't think so yet. Enraged? If it's there\u0097and why wouldn't it be?\u0097it's a furtive rage. Rage without the rage. And, for someone who seems to have lived entirely without luck, there's no lament in her\u0097none she shows to me, anyway. But as for shrewd, no. She says things sometimes that sound shrewd. She says, 'Maybe you ought to think of me as a companion of equal age who happens to look younger. I think that's where I'm at.' When I asked, 'What do you want from me?' she said, 'Some companionship. Maybe some knowledge. Sex. Pleasure. Don't worry. That's it.' When I told her once she was wise beyond her years, she told me, 'I'm dumb beyond my years.' She was sure smarter than Lester, but shrewd? No. Something in Faunia is permanently fourteen and as far as you can get from shrewd. She had an affair with her boss, the guy who hired her. Smoky Hollenbeck. I hired him\u0097guy who runs the college's physical plant. Smoky used to be a football star here. Back in the seventies I knew him as a student. Now he's a civil engineer. He hires Faunia for the custodial staff, and even while he's hiring her, she understands what's on his mind. The guy is attracted to her. He's locked into an unexciting marriage, but he's not angry with her about it\u0097he's not looking at her disdainfully, thinking, Why haven't you settled down, why are you still tramping and whoring around? No bourgeois superiority from Smoky. Smoky is doing all the right things and doing them beautifully\u0097a wife, kids, five kids, married as a man can be, a sports hero still around the college, popular and admired in town\u0097but he has a gift: he can also step outside of that. You wouldn't believe it to talk to him. Mr. Athena Square squared, performing in every single way he is supposed to perform. Appears to have bought into the story of himself one hundred percent. You would expect him to think, This stupid bitch with her fucked-up life? Get her the fuck out of my office. But he doesn't. Unlike everyone else in Athena, he is not so caught up in the legend of Smoky that he is incapable of thinking, Yeah, this is a real cunt I'd like to fuck. Or incapable of acting. He fucks her, Nathan. Gets Faunia in bed with him and another of the women from the custodial staff. Fucks 'em together. Goes on for six months. Then a real estate woman, newly divorced, fresh on the local scene, she joins the act. Smoky's circus. Smoky's secret three-ring circus. But then, after six months, he drops her\u0097takes Faunia out of the rotation and drops her. I knew nothing about any of this till she told me. And she only told me because one night in bed, her eyes roll back into her head and she calls me by his name. Whispers to me, 'Smoky.' On top of old Smoky. Her being with him in that m\u00e9nage gave me a better idea of the dame I was dealing with. Upped the ante. Gave me a jolt, actually\u0097this is no amateur. When I ask her how Smoky manages to attract his hordes, she tells me, 'By the force of his prick.' 'Explain,' I say, and she tells me, 'You know how when a real cunt walks into a room, a man knows it? Well, the same thing happens the other way round. With certain people, no matter what the disguise, you understand what they're there to do.' In bed is the only place where Faunia is in any way shrewd, Nathan. A spontaneous physical shrewdness plays the leading role in bed\u0097second lead played by transgressive audacity. In bed nothing escapes Faunia's attention. Her flesh has eyes.

All the seeming nonchalance about sex and tragedy, all of that disappears, and I'm sitting there wanting to say to her, 'Pull yourself up to the table, get the sleeve of my bathrobe out of your plate, try to listen to what I'm saying, and look at me, damn it, when you speak.'\" \"Do you say it?\" \"Doesn't seem advisable. No, I don't\u0097not as long as I prefer to preserve the intensity of what is there. I think of that canister under her bed, where she keeps the ashes she doesn't know what to do with, and I want to say, 'It's two years. It's time to bury them. If you can't put them in the ground, then go down to the river and shake out the ashes from the bridge. Let them float off. Let them go. I'll go do it with you. We'll do it together.' But I am not the father to this daughter\u0097that's not the role I play here. I'm not her professor. I'm not anyone's professor. From teaching people, correcting people, advising and examining and enlightening people, I am retired. I am a seventy-one-year-old man with a thirty-four-year-old mistress; this disqualifies me, in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, from enlightening anyone. I'm taking Viagra, Nathan. There's La Belle Dame sans Merci. I owe all of this turbulence and happiness to Viagra. Without Viagra none of this would be happening. Without Viagra I would have a picture of the world appropriate to my age and wholly different aims. Without Viagra I would have the dignity of an elderly gentleman free from desire who behaves correctly. I would not be doing something that makes no sense. I would not be doing something unseemly, rash, ill considered, and potentially disastrous for all involved. Without Viagra, I could continue, in my declining years, to develop the broad impersonal perspective of an experienced and educated honorably discharged man who has long ago given up the sensual enjoyment of life. I could continue to draw profound philosophical conclusions and have a steadying moral influence on the young, instead of having put myself back into the perpetual state of emergency that is sexual intoxication. Thanks to Viagra I've come to understand Zeus's amorous transformations. That's what they should have called Viagra. They should have called it Zeus.\" Continue",

      "body": "<p> Coleman was cleaning up his dinner dishes when I came through a screen door at the side of the house leading into the kitchen. Because he was over the sink and the water was running, and because the radio was loudly playing and he was singing along with the young Frank Sinatra \"Everything Happens to Me,\" he didn't hear me come in. It was a hot night; Coleman wore a pair of denim shorts and sneakers, and that was it. From behind, this man of seventy-one looked to be no more than forty\u0097slender and fit and forty. Coleman was not much over five eight, if that, he was not heavily muscled, and yet there was a lot of strength in him, and a lot of the bounce of the high school athlete was still visible, the quickness, the urge to action that we used to call pep. His tightly coiled, short-clipped hair had turned the color of oatmeal, and so head-on, despite the boyish snub nose, he didn't look quite so youthful as he might have if his hair were still dark. Also, there were crevices carved deeply at either side of his mouth, and in the greenish hazel eyes there was, since Iris's death and his resignation from the college, much, much weariness and spiritual depletion. Coleman had the incongruous, almost puppetlike good looks that you confront in the aging faces of movie actors who were famous on the screen as sparkling children and on whom the juvenile star is indelibly stamped. </p> <p> All in all, he remained a neat, attractive package of a man even at his age, the small-nosed Jewish type with the facial heft in the jaw, one of those crimped-haired Jews of a light yellowish skin pigmentation who possess something of the ambiguous aura of the pale blacks who are sometimes taken for white. When Coleman Silk was a sailor at the Norfolk naval base down in Virginia at the close of World War II, because his name didn't give him away as a Jew\u0097because it could as easily have been a Negro's name\u0097he'd once been identified, in a brothel, as a nigger trying to pass and been thrown out. \"Thrown out of a Norfolk whorehouse for being black, thrown out of Athena College for being white.\" I'd heard stuff like that from him frequently during these last two years, ravings about black anti-Semitism and about his treacherous, cowardly colleagues that were obviously being mainlined, unmodified, into his book. </p> <p> \"Thrown out of Athena,\" he told me, \"for being a white Jew of the sort those ignorant bastards call the enemy. That's who's made their American misery. That's who stole them out of paradise. And that's who's been holding them back all these years. What is the major source of black suffering on this planet? They know the answer without having to come to class. They know without having to open a book. Without reading they know\u0097without thinking they know. Who is responsible? The same evil Old Testament monsters responsible for the suffering of the Germans. </p> <p> \"They killed her, Nathan. And who would have thought that Iris couldn't take it? But strong as she was, loud as she was, Iris could not. Their brand of stupidity was too much even for a juggernaut like my wife. 'Spooks.' And who here would defend me? Herb Keble? As dean I brought Herb Keble into the college. Did it only months after taking the job. Brought him in not just as the first black in the social sciences but as the first black in anything other than a custodial position. But Herb too has been radicalized by the racism of Jews like me. 'I can't be with you on this, Coleman. I'm going to have to be with them.' This is what he told me when I went to ask for his support. To my face. I'm going to have to be with them. Them! </p> <p> \"You should have seen Herb at Iris's funeral. Crushed. Devastated. Somebody died? Herbert didn't intend for anybody to die. These shenanigans were so much jockeying for power. To gain a bigger say in how the college is run. They were just exploiting a useful situation. It was a way to prod Haines and the administration into doing what they otherwise would never have done. More blacks on campus. More black students, more black professors. Representation\u0097that was the issue. The only issue. God knows nobody was meant to die. Or to resign either. That too took Herbert by surprise. Why should Coleman Silk resign? Nobody was going to fire him. Nobody would dare to fire him. They were doing what they were doing just because they could do it. Their intention was to hold my feet over the flames just a little while longer\u0097why couldn't I have been patient and waited? By the next semester who would have remembered any of it? The incident\u0097the incident!\u0097provided them with an 'organizing issue' of the sort that was needed at a racially retarded place like Athena. Why did I quit? By the time I quit it was essentially over. What the hell was I quitting for?\" </p> <p> On just my previous visit, Coleman had begun waving something in my face from the moment I'd come through the door, yet another document from the hundreds of documents filed in the boxes labeled \"Spooks.\" \"Here. One of my gifted colleagues. Writing about one of the two who brought the charges against me\u0097a student who had never attended my class, flunked all but one of the other courses she was taking, and rarely attended them. I thought she flunked because she couldn't confront the material, let alone begin to master it, but it turned out that she flunked because she was too intimidated by the racism emanating from her white professors to work up the courage to go to class. The very racism that I had articulated. In one of those meetings, hearings, whatever they were, they asked me, 'What factors, in your judgment, led to this student's failure?' 'What factors?' I said. 'Indifference. Arrogance. Apathy. Personal distress. Who knows?' 'But,' they asked me, 'in light of these factors, what positive recommendations did you make to this student?' 'I didn't make any. I'd never laid eyes on her. If I'd had the opportunity, I would have recommended that she leave school.' 'Why?' they asked me. 'Because she didn't belong in school.' </p> <p> \"Let me read from this document. Listen to this. Filed by a colleague of mine supporting Tracy Cummings as someone we should not be too harsh or too quick to judge, certainly not someone we should turn away and reject. Tracy we must nurture, Tracy we must understand\u0097we have to know, this scholar tells us, 'where Tracy's coming from.' Let me read you the last sentences. 'Tracy is from a rather difficult background, in that she separated from her immediate family in tenth grade and lived with relatives. As a result, she was not particularly good at dealing with the realities of a situation. This defect I admit. But she is ready, willing, and able to change her approach to living. What I have seen coming to birth in her during these last weeks is a realization of the seriousness of her avoidance of reality.' Sentences composed by one Delphine Roux, chairman of Languages and Literature, who teaches, among other things, a course in French classicism. A realization of the seriousness of her avoidance of reality. Ah, enough. Enough. This is sickening. This is just too sickening.\" </p> <p> That's what I witnessed, more often than not, when I came to keep Coleman company on a Saturday night: a humiliating disgrace that was still eating away at someone who was still fully vital. The great man brought low and suffering still the shame of failure. Something like what you might have seen had you dropped in on Nixon at San Clemente or on Jimmy Carter, down in Georgia, before he began doing penance for his defeat by becoming a carpenter. Something very sad. And yet, despite my sympathy for Coleman's ordeal and for all he had unjustly lost and for the near impossibility of his tearing himself free from his bitterness, there were evenings when, after having sipped only a few drops of his brandy, it required something like a feat of magic for me to stay awake. </p> <p> But on the night I'm describing, when we had drifted onto the cool screened-in side porch that he used in the summertime as a study, he was as fond of the world as a man can be. He'd pulled a couple of bottles of beer from the refrigerator when we left the kitchen, and we were seated across from each other at either side of the long trestle table that was his desk out there and that was stacked at one end with composition books, some twenty or thirty of them, divided into three piles. </p> <p> \"Well, there it is,\" said Coleman, now this calm, unoppressed, entirely new being. \"That's it. That's Spooks. Finished a first draft yesterday, spent all day today reading it through, and every page of it made me sick. The violence in the handwriting was enough to make me despise the author. That I should spend a single quarter of an hour at this, let alone two years . . . Iris died because of them? Who will believe it? I hardly believe it myself any longer. To turn this screed into a book, to bleach out the raging misery and turn it into something by a sane human being, would take two years more at least. And what would I then have, aside from two years more of thinking about 'them'? Not that I've given myself over to forgiveness. Don't get me wrong: I hate the bastards. I hate the fucking bastards the way Gulliver hates the whole human race after he goes and lives with those horses. I hate them with a real biological aversion. Though those horses I always found ridiculous. Didn't you? I used to think of them as the wasp establishment that ran this place when I first got here.\" </p> <p> \"You're in good form, Coleman\u0097barely a glimmer of the old madness. Three weeks, a month ago, whenever it was I saw you last, you were still knee-deep in your own blood.\" </p> <p> \"Because of this thing. But I read it and it's shit and I'm over it. I can't do what the pros do. Writing about myself, I can't maneuver the creative remove. Page after page, it is still the raw thing. It's a parody of the self-justifying memoir. The hopelessness of explanation.\" Smiling, he said, \"Kissinger can unload fourteen hundred pages of this stuff every other year, but it's defeated me. Blindly secure though I may seem to be in my narcissistic bubble, I'm no match for him. I quit.\" </p> <p> Now, most writers who are brought to a standstill after rereading two years' work\u0097even one year's work, merely half a year's work\u0097and finding it hopelessly misguided and bringing down on it the critical guillotine are reduced to a state of suicidal despair from which it can take months to begin to recover. Yet Coleman, by abandoning a draft of a book as bad as the draft he'd finished, had somehow managed to swim free not only from the wreck of the book but from the wreck of his life. Without the book he appeared now to be without the slightest craving to set the record straight; shed of the passion to clear his name and criminalize as murderers his opponents, he was embalmed no longer in injustice. Aside from watching Nelson Mandela, on TV, forgiving his jailers even as he was leaving jail with his last miserable jail meal still being assimilated into his system, I'd never before seen a change of heart transform a martyred being quite so swiftly. I couldn't understand it, and I at first couldn't bring myself to believe in it either. </p> <p> \"Walking away like this, cheerfully saying, 'It's defeated me,' walking away from all this work, from all this loathing\u0097well, how are you going to fill the outrage void?\" </p> <p> \"I'm not.\" He got the cards and a notepad to keep score and we pulled our chairs down to where the trestle table was clear of papers. He shuffled the cards and I cut them and he dealt. And then, in this odd, serene state of contentment brought on by the seeming emancipation from despising everyone at Athena who, deliberately and in bad faith, had misjudged, misused, and besmirched him\u0097had plunged him, for two years, into a misanthropic exertion of Swiftian proportions\u0097he began to rhapsodize about the great bygone days when his cup ranneth over and his considerable talent for conscientiousness was spent garnering and tendering pleasure. </p> <p> Now that he was no longer grounded in his hate, we were going to talk about women. This was a new Coleman. Or perhaps an old Coleman, the oldest adult Coleman there was, the most satisfied Coleman there had ever been. Not Coleman pre-spooks and unmaligned as a racist, but the Coleman contaminated by desire alone. </p> <p> \"I came out of the navy, I got a place in the Village,\" he began to tell me as he assembled his hand, \"and all I had to do was go down into the subway. It was like fishing down there. Go down into the subway and come up with a girl. And then\"\u0097he stopped to pick up my discard\u0097\"all at once, got my degree, got married, got my job, kids, and that was the end of the fishing.\" </p> <p> \"Never fished again.\" </p> <p> \"Almost never. True. Virtually never. As good as never. Hear these songs?\" The four radios were playing in the house, and so even out on the road it would have been impossible not to hear them. \"After the war, those were the songs,\" he said. \"Four, five years of the songs, the girls, and that fulfilled my every ideal. I found a letter today. Cleaning out that Spooks stuff, found a letter from one of the girls. The girl. After I got my first appointment, out on Long Island, out at Adelphi, and Iris was pregnant with Jeff, this letter arrived. A girl nearly six feet tall. Iris was a big girl too. But not big like Steena. Iris was substantial. Steena was something else. Steena sent me this letter in 1954 and it turned up today while I was shoveling out the files.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,417868,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

He'd pulled a couple of bottles of beer from the refrigerator when we left the kitchen, and we were seated across from each other at either side of the long trestle table that was his desk out there and that was stacked at one end with composition books, some twenty or thirty of them, divided into three piles. \"Well, there it is,\" said Coleman, now this calm, unoppressed, entirely new being. \"That's it. That's Spooks. Finished a first draft yesterday, spent all day today reading it through, and every page of it made me sick. The violence in the handwriting was enough to make me despise the author. That I should spend a single quarter of an hour at this, let alone two years . . . Iris died because of them? Who will believe it? I hardly believe it myself any longer. To turn this screed into a book, to bleach out the raging misery and turn it into something by a sane human being, would take two years more at least. And what would I then have, aside from two years more of thinking about 'them'? Not that I've given myself over to forgiveness. Don't get me wrong: I hate the bastards. I hate the fucking bastards the way Gulliver hates the whole human race after he goes and lives with those horses. I hate them with a real biological aversion. Though those horses I always found ridiculous. Didn't you? I used to think of them as the wasp establishment that ran this place when I first got here.\" \"You're in good form, Coleman\u0097barely a glimmer of the old madness. Three weeks, a month ago, whenever it was I saw you last, you were still knee-deep in your own blood.\" \"Because of this thing. But I read it and it's shit and I'm over it. I can't do what the pros do. Writing about myself, I can't maneuver the creative remove. Page after page, it is still the raw thing. It's a parody of the self-justifying memoir. The hopelessness of explanation.\" Smiling, he said, \"Kissinger can unload fourteen hundred pages of this stuff every other year, but it's defeated me. Blindly secure though I may seem to be in my narcissistic bubble, I'm no match for him. I quit.\" Now, most writers who are brought to a standstill after rereading two years' work\u0097even one year's work, merely half a year's work\u0097and finding it hopelessly misguided and bringing down on it the critical guillotine are reduced to a state of suicidal despair from which it can take months to begin to recover. Yet Coleman, by abandoning a draft of a book as bad as the draft he'd finished, had somehow managed to swim free not only from the wreck of the book but from the wreck of his life. Without the book he appeared now to be without the slightest craving to set the record straight; shed of the passion to clear his name and criminalize as murderers his opponents, he was embalmed no longer in injustice. Aside from watching Nelson Mandela, on TV, forgiving his jailers even as he was leaving jail with his last miserable jail meal still being assimilated into his system, I'd never before seen a change of heart transform a martyred being quite so swiftly. I couldn't understand it, and I at first couldn't bring myself to believe in it either. \"Walking away like this, cheerfully saying, 'It's defeated me,' walking away from all this work, from all this loathing\u0097well, how are you going to fill the outrage void?\" \"I'm not.\" He got the cards and a notepad to keep score and we pulled our chairs down to where the trestle table was clear of papers. He shuffled the cards and I cut them and he dealt. And then, in this odd, serene state of contentment brought on by the seeming emancipation from despising everyone at Athena who, deliberately and in bad faith, had misjudged, misused, and besmirched him\u0097had plunged him, for two years, into a misanthropic exertion of Swiftian proportions\u0097he began to rhapsodize about the great bygone days when his cup ranneth over and his considerable talent for conscientiousness was spent garnering and tendering pleasure. Now that he was no longer grounded in his hate, we were going to talk about women. This was a new Coleman. Or perhaps an old Coleman, the oldest adult Coleman there was, the most satisfied Coleman there had ever been. Not Coleman pre-spooks and unmaligned as a racist, but the Coleman contaminated by desire alone. \"I came out of the navy, I got a place in the Village,\" he began to tell me as he assembled his hand, \"and all I had to do was go down into the subway. It was like fishing down there. Go down into the subway and come up with a girl. And then\"\u0097he stopped to pick up my discard\u0097\"all at once, got my degree, got married, got my job, kids, and that was the end of the fishing.\" \"Never fished again.\" \"Almost never. True. Virtually never. As good as never. Hear these songs?\" The four radios were playing in the house, and so even out on the road it would have been impossible not to hear them. \"After the war, those were the songs,\" he said. \"Four, five years of the songs, the girls, and that fulfilled my every ideal. I found a letter today. Cleaning out that Spooks stuff, found a letter from one of the girls. The girl. After I got my first appointment, out on Long Island, out at Adelphi, and Iris was pregnant with Jeff, this letter arrived. A girl nearly six feet tall. Iris was a big girl too. But not big like Steena. Iris was substantial. Steena was something else. Steena sent me this letter in 1954 and it turned up today while I was shoveling out the files.\" Continue",

      "body": "<p>It was in the summer of 1998 that my neighbor Coleman Silk\u0097who, before retiring two years earlier, had been a classics professor at nearby Athena College for some twenty-odd years as well as serving for sixteen more as the dean of faculty\u0097confided to me that, at the age of seventy-one, he was having an affair with a thirty-four-year-old cleaning woman who worked down at the college. Twice a week she also cleaned the rural post office, a small gray clapboard shack that looked as if it might have sheltered an Okie family from the winds of the Dust Bowl back in the 1930s and that, sitting alone and forlorn across from the gas station and the general store, flies its American flag at the junction of the two roads that mark the commercial center of this mountainside town. </p> <p> Coleman had first seen the woman mopping the post office floor when he went around late one day, a few minutes before closing time, to get his mail\u0097a thin, tall, angular woman with graying blond hair yanked back into a ponytail and the kind of severely sculpted features customarily associated with the church-ruled, hardworking goodwives who suffered through New England's harsh beginnings, stern colonial women locked up within the reigning morality and obedient to it. Her name was Faunia Farley, and whatever miseries she endured she kept concealed behind one of those inexpressive bone faces that hide nothing and bespeak an immense loneliness. Faunia lived in a room at a local dairy farm where she helped with the milking in order to pay her rent. She'd had two years of high school education. </p> <p> The summer that Coleman took me into his confidence about Faunia Farley and their secret was the summer, fittingly enough, that Bill Clinton's secret emerged in every last mortifying detail\u0097every last lifelike detail, the livingness, like the mortification, exuded by the pungency of the specific data. We hadn't had a season like it since somebody stumbled upon the new Miss America nude in an old issue of Penthouse, pictures of her elegantly posed on her knees and on her back that forced the shamed young woman to relinquish her crown and go on to become a huge pop star. Ninety-eight in New England was a summer of exquisite warmth and sunshine, in baseball a summer of mythical battle between a home-run god who was white and a home-run god who was brown, and in America the summer of an enormous piety binge, a purity binge, when terrorism\u0097which had replaced communism as the prevailing threat to the country's security\u0097was succeeded by cocksucking, and a virile, youthful middle-aged president and a brash, smitten twenty-one-year-old employee carrying on in the Oval Office like two teenage kids in a parking lot revived America's oldest communal passion, historically perhaps its most treacherous and subversive pleasure: the ecstasy of sanctimony. In the Congress, in the press, and on the networks, the righteous grandstanding creeps, crazy to blame, deplore, and punish, were everywhere out moralizing to beat the band: all of them in a calculated frenzy with what Hawthorne (who, in the 1860s, lived not many miles from my door) identified in the incipient country of long ago as \"the persecuting spirit\"; all of them eager to enact the astringent rituals of purification that would excise the erection from the executive branch, thereby making things cozy and safe enough for Senator Lieberman's ten-year-old daughter to watch TV with her embarrassed daddy again. No, if you haven't lived through 1998, you don't know what sanctimony is. The syndicated conservative newspaper columnist William F. Buckley wrote, \"When Abelard did it, it was possible to prevent its happening again,\" insinuating that the president's malfeasance\u0097what Buckley elsewhere called Clinton's \"incontinent carnality\"\u0097might best be remedied with nothing so bloodless as impeachment but, rather, by the twelfth-century punishment meted out to Canon Abelard by the knife-wielding associates of Abelard's ecclesiastical colleague, Canon Fulbert, for Abelard's secret seduction of and marriage to Fulbert's niece, the virgin Heloise. Unlike Khomeini's fatwa condemning to death Salman Rushdie, Buckley's wistful longing for the corrective retribution of castration carried with it no financial incentive for any prospective perpetrator. It was prompted by a spirit no less exacting than the ayatollah's, however, and in behalf of no less exalted ideals. </p> <p> It was the summer in America when the nausea returned, when the joking didn't stop, when the speculation and the theorizing and the hyperbole didn't stop, when the moral obligation to explain to one's children about adult life was abrogated in favor of maintaining in them every illusion about adult life, when the smallness of people was simply crushing, when some kind of demon had been unleashed in the nation and, on both sides, people wondered \"Why are we so crazy?,\" when men and women alike, upon awakening in the morning, discovered that during the night, in a state of sleep that transported them beyond envy or loathing, they had dreamed of the brazenness of Bill Clinton. I myself dreamed of a mammoth banner, draped dadaistically like a Christo wrapping from one end of the White House to the other and bearing the legend a human being lives here. It was the summer when\u0097for the billionth time\u0097the jumble, the mayhem, the mess proved itself more subtle than this one's ideology and that one's morality. It was the summer when a president's penis was on everyone's mind, and life, in all its shameless impurity, once again confounded America. </p> <p> Sometimes on a Saturday, Coleman Silk would give me a ring and invite me to drive over from my side of the mountain after dinner to listen to music, or to play, for a penny a point, a little gin rummy, or to sit in his living room for a couple of hours and sip some cognac and help him get through what was always for him the worst night of the week. By the summer of 1998, he had been alone up here\u0097alone in the large old white clapboard house where he'd raised four children with his wife, Iris\u0097for close to two years, ever since Iris suffered a stroke and died overnight while he was in the midst of battling with the college over a charge of racism brought against him by two students in one of his classes. </p> <p> Coleman had by then been at Athena almost all his academic life, an outgoing, sharp-witted, forcefully smooth big-city charmer, something of a warrior, something of an operator, hardly the prototypical pedantic professor of Latin and Greek (as witness the Conversational Greek and Latin Club that he started, heretically, as a young instructor). His venerable survey course in ancient Greek literature in translation\u0097known as GHM, for Gods, Heroes, and Myth\u0097was popular with students precisely because of everything direct, frank, and unacademically forceful in his comportment. \"You know how European literature begins?\" he'd ask, after having taken the roll at the first class meeting. \"With a quarrel. All of European literature springs from a fight.\" And then he picked up his copy of The Iliad and read to the class the opening lines. \"'Divine Muse, sing of the ruinous wrath of Achilles . . . Begin where they first quarreled, Agamemnon the King of men, and great Achilles.' And what are they quarreling about, these two violent, mighty souls? It's as basic as a barroom brawl. They are quarreling over a woman. A girl, really. A girl stolen from her father. A girl abducted in a war. Mia kouri\u0097that is how she is described in the poem. Mia, as in modern Greek, is the indefinite article 'a'; kouri, or girl, evolves in modern Greek into kori, meaning daughter. Now, Agamemnon much prefers this girl to his wife, Clytemnestra. 'Clytemnestra is not as good as she is,' he says, 'neither in face nor in figure.' That puts directly enough, does it not, why he doesn't want to give her up? When Achilles demands that Agamemnon return the girl to her father in order to assuage Apollo, the god who is murderously angry about the circumstances surrounding her abduction, Agamemnon refuses: he'll agree only if Achilles gives him his girl in exchange. Thus reigniting Achilles. Adrenal Achilles: the most highly flammable of explosive wildmen any writer has ever enjoyed portraying; especially where his prestige and his appetite are concerned, the most hypersensitive killing machine in the history of warfare. Celebrated Achilles: alienated and estranged by a slight to his honor. Great heroic Achilles, who, through the strength of his rage at an insult\u0097the insult of not getting the girl\u0097isolates himself, positions himself defiantly outside the very society whose glorious protector he is and whose need of him is enormous. A quarrel, then, a brutal quarrel over a young girl and her young body and the delights of sexual rapacity: there, for better or worse, in this offense against the phallic entitlement, the phallic dignity, of a powerhouse of a warrior prince, is how the great imaginative literature of Europe begins, and that is why, close to three thousand years later, we are going to begin there today . . .\" </p> <p> Coleman was one of a handful of Jews on the Athena faculty when he was hired and perhaps among the first of the Jews permitted to teach in a classics department anywhere in America; a few years earlier, Athena's solitary Jew had been E. I. Lonoff, the all-but-forgotten short story writer whom, back when I was myself a newly published apprentice in trouble and eagerly seeking the validation of a master, I had once paid a memorable visit to here. Through the eighties and into the nineties, Coleman was also the first and only Jew ever to serve at Athena as dean of faculty; then, in 1995, after retiring as dean in order to round out his career back in the classroom, he resumed teaching two of his courses under the aegis of the combined languages and literature program that had absorbed the Classics Department and that was run by Professor Delphine Roux. As dean, and with the full support of an ambitious new president, Coleman had taken an antiquated, backwater, Sleepy Hollowish college and, not without steamrolling, put an end to the place as a gentlemen's farm by aggressively encouraging the deadwood among the faculty's old guard to seek early retirement, recruiting ambitious young assistant professors, and revolutionizing the curriculum. It's almost a certainty that had he retired, without incident, in his own good time, there would have been the festschrift, there would have been the institution of the Coleman Silk Lecture Series, there would have been a classical studies chair established in his name, and perhaps\u0097given his importance to the twentieth-century revitalization of the place\u0097the humanities building or even North Hall, the college's landmark, would have been renamed in his honor after his death. In the small academic world where he had lived the bulk of his life, he would have long ceased to be resented or controversial or even feared, and, instead, officially glorified forever. </p> <p> It was about midway into his second semester back as a full-time professor that Coleman spoke the self-incriminating word that would cause him voluntarily to sever all ties to the college-the single self-incriminating word of the many millions spoken aloud in his years of teaching and administering at Athena, and the word that, as Coleman understood things, directly led to his wife's death. </p> <p> The class consisted of fourteen students. Coleman had taken attendance at the beginning of the first several lectures so as to learn their names. As there were still two names that failed to elicit a response by the fifth week into the semester, Coleman, in the sixth week, opened the session by asking, \"Does anyone know these people? Do they exist or are they spooks?\" </p> <p> Later that day he was astonished to be called in by his successor, the new dean of faculty, to address the charge of racism brought against him by the two missing students, who turned out to be black, and who, though absent, had quickly learned of the locution in which he'd publicly raised the question of their absence. Coleman told the dean, \"I was referring to their possibly ectoplasmic character. Isn't that obvious? These two students had not attended a single class. That's all I knew about them. I was using the word in its customary and primary meaning: 'spook' as a specter or a ghost. I had no idea what color these two students might be. I had known perhaps fifty years ago but had wholly forgotten that 'spooks' is an invidious term sometimes applied to blacks. Otherwise, since I am totally meticulous regarding student sensibilities, I would never have used that word. Consider the context: Do they exist or are they spooks? The charge of racism is spurious. It is preposterous. My colleagues know it is preposterous and my students know it is preposterous. The issue, the only issue, is the nonattendance of these two students and their flagrant and inexcusable neglect of work. What's galling is that the charge is not just false\u0097it is spectacularly false.\" Having said altogether enough in his defense, considering the matter closed, he left for home. </p> <p> Now, even ordinary deans, I am told, serving as they do in a no man's land between the faculty and the higher administration, invariably make enemies. They don't always grant the salary raises that are requested or the convenient parking places that are so coveted or the larger offices professors believe they are entitled to. Candidates for appointments or promotion, especially in weak departments, are routinely rejected. Departmental petitions for additional faculty positions and secretarial help are almost always turned down, as are requests for reduced teaching loads and for freedom from early morning classes. Funds for travel to academic conferences are regularly denied, et cetera, et cetera. But Coleman had been no ordinary dean, and who he got rid of and how he got rid of them, what he abolished and what he established, and how audaciously he performed his job into the teeth of tremendous resistance succeeded in more than merely slighting or offending a few odd ingrates and malcontents. Under the protection of Pierce Roberts, the handsome young hotshot president with all the hair who came in and appointed him to the deanship\u0097and who told him, \"Changes are going to be made, and anybody who's unhappy should just think about leaving or early retirement\"\u0097Coleman had overturned everything. When, eight years later, midway through Coleman's tenure, Roberts accepted a prestigious Big Ten presidency, it was on the strength of a reputation for all that had been achieved at Athena in record time\u0097achieved, however, not by the glamorous president who was essentially a fund-raiser, who'd taken none of the hits and moved on from Athena heralded and unscathed, but by his determined dean of faculty. In the very first month he was appointed dean, Coleman had invited every faculty member in for a talk, including several senior professors who were the scions of the old county families who'd founded and originally endowed the place and who themselves didn't really need the money but gladly accepted their salaries. Each of them was instructed beforehand to bring along his or her c.v., and if someone didn't bring it, because he or she was too grand, Coleman had it in front of him on his desk anyway. And for a full hour he kept them there, sometimes even longer, until, having so persuasively indicated that things at Athena had at long last changed, he had begun to make them sweat. Nor did he hesitate to open the interview by flipping through the c.v. and saying, \"For the last eleven years, just what have you been doing?\" And when they told him, as an overwhelming number of the faculty did, that they'd been publishing regularly in Athena Notes, when he'd heard one time too many about the philological, bibliographical, or archaeological scholarly oddment each of them annually culled from an ancient Ph.D. dissertation for \"publication\" in the mimeographed quarterly bound in gray cardboard that was cataloged nowhere on earth but in the college library, he was reputed to have dared to break the Athena civility code by saying, \"In other words, you people recycle your own trash.\" Not only did he then shut down Athena Notes by returning the tiny bequest to the donor\u0097the father-in-law of the editor\u0097but, to encourage early retirement, he forced the deadest of the deadwood out of the courses they'd been delivering by rote for the last twenty or thirty years and into freshman English and the history survey and the new freshman orientation program held during the hot last days of the summer. He eliminated the ill-named Scholar of the Year Prize and assigned the thousand dollars elsewhere. For the first time in the college's history, he made people apply formally, with a detailed project description, for paid sabbatical leave, which was more often than not denied. He got rid of the clubby faculty lunchroom, which boasted the most exquisite of the paneled oak interiors on the campus, converted it back into the honors seminar room it was intended to be, and made the faculty eat in the cafeteria with the students. He insisted on faculty meetings\u0097never holding them had made the previous dean enormously popular. Coleman had attendance taken by the faculty secretary so that even the eminences with the three-hour-a-week schedules were forced onto the campus to show up. He found a provision in the college constitution that said there were to be no executive committees, and arguing that those stodgy impediments to serious change had grown up only by convention and tradition, he abolished them and ruled these faculty meetings by fiat, using each as an occasion to announce what he was going to do next that was sure to stir up even more resentment. Under his leadership, promotion became difficult\u0097and this, perhaps, was the greatest shock of all: people were no longer promoted through rank automatically on the basis of being popular teachers, and they didn't get salary increases that weren't tied to merit. In short, he brought in competition, he made the place competitive, which, as an early enemy noted, \"is what Jews do.\" And whenever an angry ad hoc committee was formed to go and complain to Pierce Roberts, the president unfailingly backed Coleman. </p> <p> In the Roberts years all the bright younger people he recruited loved Coleman because of the room he was making for them and because of the good people he began hiring out of graduate programs at Johns Hopkins and Yale and Cornell\u0097\"the revolution of quality,\" as they themselves liked to describe it. They prized him for taking the ruling elite out of their little club and threatening their self-presentation, which never fails to drive a pompous professor crazy. All the older guys who were the weakest part of the faculty had survived on the ways that they thought of themselves\u0097the greatest scholar of the year 100 b.c., and so forth\u0097and once those were challenged from above, their confidence eroded and, in a matter of a few years, they had nearly all disappeared. Heady times! But after Pierce Roberts moved on to the big job at Michigan, and Haines, the new president, came in with no particular loyalty to Coleman\u0097and, unlike his predecessor, exhibiting no special tolerance for the brand of bulldozing vanity and autocratic ego that had cleaned the place out in so brief a period\u0097and as the young people Coleman had kept on as well as those he'd recruited began to become the veteran faculty, a reaction against Dean Silk started to set in. How strong it was he had never entirely realized until he counted all the people, department by department, who seemed to be not at all displeased that the word the old dean had chosen to characterize his two seemingly nonexistent students was definable not only by the primary dictionary meaning that he maintained was obviously the one he'd intended but by the pejorative racial meaning that had sent his two black students to lodge their complaint. </p> <p> I remember clearly that April day two years back when Iris Silk died and the insanity took hold of Coleman. Other than to offer a nod to one or the other of them whenever our paths crossed down at the general store or the post office, I had not really known the Silks or anything much about them before then. I hadn't even known that Coleman had grown up some four or five miles away from me in the tiny Essex County town of East Orange, New Jersey, and that, as a 1944 graduate of East Orange High, he had been some six years ahead of me in my neighboring Newark school. Coleman had made no effort to get to know me, nor had I left New York and moved into a two-room cabin set way back in a field on a rural road high in the Berkshires to meet new people or to join a new community. The invitations I received during my first months out here in 1993\u0097to come to a dinner, to tea, to a cocktail party, to trek to the college down in the valley to deliver a public lecture or, if I preferred, to talk informally to a literature class\u0097I politely declined, and after that both the neighbors and the college let me be to live and do my work on my own. </p> <p> But then, on that afternoon two years back, having driven directly from making arrangements for Iris's burial, Coleman was at the side of my house, banging on the door and asking to be let in. Though he had something urgent to ask, he couldn't stay seated for more than thirty seconds to clarify what it was. He got up, sat down, got up again, roamed round and round my workroom, speaking loudly and in a rush, even menacingly shaking a fist in the air when\u0097erroneously\u0097he believed emphasis was needed. I had to write something for him\u0097he all but ordered me to. If he wrote the story in all of its absurdity, altering nothing, nobody would believe it, nobody would take it seriously, people would say it was a ludicrous lie, a self-serving exaggeration, they would say that more than his having uttered the word \"spooks\" in a classroom had to lie behind his downfall. But if I wrote it, if a professional writer wrote it . . . </p> <p> All the restraint had collapsed within him, and so watching him, listening to him\u0097a man I did not know, but clearly someone accomplished and of consequence now completely unhinged\u0097was like being present at a bad highway accident or a fire or a frightening explosion, at a public disaster that mesmerizes as much by its improbability as by its grotesqueness. The way he careened around the room made me think of those familiar chickens that keep on going after having been beheaded. His head had been lopped off, the head encasing the educated brain of the once unassailable faculty dean and classics professor, and what I was witnessing was the amputated rest of him spinning out of control. </p> <p> I\u0097whose house he had never before entered, whose very voice he had barely heard before\u0097had to put aside whatever else I might be doing and write about how his enemies at Athena, in striking out at him, had instead felled her. Creating their false image of him, calling him everything that he wasn't and could never be, they had not merely misrepresented a professional career conducted with the utmost seriousness and dedication\u0097they had killed his wife of over forty years. Killed her as if they'd taken aim and fired a bullet into her heart. I had to write about this \"absurdity,\" that \"absurdity\"\u0097I, who then knew nothing about his woes at the college and could not even begin to follow the chronology of the horror that, for five months now, had engulfed him and the late Iris Silk: the punishing immersion in meetings, hearings, and interviews, the documents and letters submitted to college officials, to faculty committees, to a pro bono black lawyer representing the two students . . . the charges, denials, and countercharges, the obtuseness, ignorance, and cynicism, the gross and deliberate misinterpretations, the laborious, repetitious explanations, the prosecutorial questions\u0097and always, perpetually, the pervasive sense of unreality. \"Her murder!\" Coleman cried, leaning across my desk and hammering on it with his fist. \"These people murdered Iris!\" </p> <p> The face he showed me, the face he placed no more than a foot from my own, was by now dented and lopsided and\u0097for the face of a well-groomed, youthfully handsome older man\u0097strangely repellent, more than likely distorted from the toxic effect of all the emotion coursing through him. It was, up close, bruised and ruined like a piece of fruit that's been knocked from its stall in the marketplace and kicked to and fro along the ground by the passing shoppers. </p> <p> There is something fascinating about what moral suffering can do to someone who is in no obvious way a weak or feeble person. It's more insidious even than what physical illness can do, because there is no morphine drip or spinal block or radical surgery to alleviate it. Once you're in its grip, it's as though it will have to kill you for you to be free of it. Its raw realism is like nothing else. </p> <p> Murdered. For Coleman that alone explained how, out of nowhere, the end could have come to an energetic sixty-four-year-old woman of commanding presence and in perfect health, an abstract painter whose canvases dominated the local art shows and who herself autocratically administered the town artists' association, a poet published in the county newspaper, in her day the college's leading politically active opponent of bomb shelters, of strontium 90, eventually of the Vietnam War, opinionated, unyielding, impolitic, an imperious whirlwind of a woman recognizable a hundred yards away by her great tangled wreath of wiry white hair; so strong a person, apparently, that despite his own formidableness, the dean who reputedly could steamroll anybody, the dean who had done the academically impossible by bringing deliverance to Athena College, could best his own wife at nothing other than tennis. </p> <p> Once Coleman had come under attack, however\u0097once the racist charge had been taken up for investigation, not only by the new dean of faculty but by the college's small black student organization and by a black activist group from Pittsfield\u0097the outright madness of it blotted out the million difficulties of the Silks' marriage, and that same imperiousness that had for four decades clashed with his own obstinate autonomy and resulted in the unending friction of their lives, Iris placed at the disposal of her husband's cause. Though for years they had not slept in the same bed or been able to endure very much of the other's conversation\u0097or of the other's friends\u0097the Silks were side by side again, waving their fists in the faces of people they hated more profoundly than, in their most insufferable moments, they could manage to hate each other. All they'd had in common as comradely lovers forty years earlier in Greenwich Village\u0097when he was at NYU finishing up his Ph.D. and Iris was an escapee fresh from two nutty anarchist parents in Passaic and modeling for life drawing classes at the Art Students League, armed already with her thicket of important hair, big-featured and voluptuous, already then a theatrical-looking high priestess in folkloric jewelry, the biblical high priestess from before the time of the synagogue\u0097all they'd had in common in those Village days (except for the erotic passion) once again broke wildly out into the open . . . until the morning when she awakened with a ferocious headache and no feeling in one of her arms. Coleman rushed her to the hospital, but by the next day she was dead. </p> <p> \"They meant to kill me and they got her instead.\" So Coleman told me more than once during that unannounced visit to my house, and then made sure to tell every single person at her funeral the following afternoon. And so he still believed. He was not susceptible to any other explanation. Ever since her death\u0097and since he'd come to recognize that his ordeal wasn't a subject I wished to address in my fiction and he had accepted back from me all the documentation dumped on my desk that day\u0097he had been at work on a book of his own about why he had resigned from Athena, a nonfiction book he was calling Spooks. </p> <p> There's a small FM station over in Springfield that on Saturday nights, from six to midnight, takes a break from the regular classical programming and plays big-band music for the first few hours of the evening and then jazz later on. On my side of the mountain you get nothing but static tuning to that frequency, but on the slope where Coleman lives the reception's fine, and on the occasions when he'd invite me for a Saturday evening drink, all those sugary-sweet dance tunes that kids of our generation heard continuously over the radio and played on the jukeboxes back in the forties could be heard coming from Coleman's house as soon as I stepped out of my car in his driveway. Coleman had it going full blast not just on the living room stereo receiver but on the radio beside his bed, the radio beside the shower, and the radio beside the kitchen bread box. No matter what he might be doing around the house on a Saturday night, until the station signed off at midnight\u0097following a ritual weekly half hour of Benny Goodman\u0097he wasn't out of earshot for a minute. </p> <p> Oddly, he said, none of the serious stuff he'd been listening to all his adult life put him into emotional motion the way that old swing music now did: \"Everything stoical within me unclenches and the wish not to die, never to die, is almost too great to bear. And all this,\" he explained, \"from listening to Vaughn Monroe.\" Some nights, every line of every song assumed a significance so bizarrely momentous that he'd wind up dancing by himself the shuffling, drifting, repetitious, uninspired, yet wonderfully serviceable, mood- making fox trot that he used to dance with the East Orange High girls on whom he pressed, through his trousers, his first meaningful erections; and while he danced, nothing he was feeling, he told me, was simulated, neither the terror (over extinction) nor the rapture (over \"You sigh, the song begins. You speak, and I hear violins\"). The teardrops were all spontaneously shed, however astonished he may have been by how little resistance he had to Helen O'Connell and Bob Eberly alternately delivering the verses of \"Green Eyes,\" however much he might marvel at how Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey were able to transform him into the kind of assailable old man he could never have expected to be. \"But let anyone born in 1926,\" he'd say, \"try to stay alone at home on a Saturday night in 1998 and listen to Dick Haymes singing 'Those Little White Lies.' Just have them do that, and then let them tell me afterwards if they have not understood at last the celebrated doctrine of the catharsis effected by tragedy.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,417860,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was in the summer of 1998 that my neighbor Coleman Silk\u0097who, before retiring two years earlier, had been a classics professor at nearby Athena College for some twenty-odd years as well as serving for sixteen more as the dean of faculty\u0097confided to me that, at the age of seventy-one, he was having an affair with a thirty-four-year-old cleaning woman who worked down at the college. Twice a week she also cleaned the rural post office, a small gray clapboard shack that looked as if it might have sheltered an Okie family from the winds of the Dust Bowl back in the 1930s and that, sitting alone and forlorn across from the gas station and the general store, flies its American flag at the junction of the two roads that mark the commercial center of this mountainside town. Coleman had first seen the woman mopping the post office floor when he went around late one day, a few minutes before closing time, to get his mail\u0097a thin, tall, angular woman with graying blond hair yanked back into a ponytail and the kind of severely sculpted features customarily associated with the church-ruled, hardworking goodwives who suffered through New England's harsh beginnings, stern colonial women locked up within the reigning morality and obedient to it. Her name was Faunia Farley, and whatever miseries she endured she kept concealed behind one of those inexpressive bone faces that hide nothing and bespeak an immense loneliness. Faunia lived in a room at a local dairy farm where she helped with the milking in order to pay her rent. She'd had two years of high school education. The summer that Coleman took me into his confidence about Faunia Farley and their secret was the summer, fittingly enough, that Bill Clinton's secret emerged in every last mortifying detail\u0097every last lifelike detail, the livingness, like the mortification, exuded by the pungency of the specific data. We hadn't had a season like it since somebody stumbled upon the new Miss America nude in an old issue of Penthouse, pictures of her elegantly posed on her knees and on her back that forced the shamed young woman to relinquish her crown and go on to become a huge pop star. Ninety-eight in New England was a summer of exquisite warmth and sunshine, in baseball a summer of mythical battle between a home-run god who was white and a home-run god who was brown, and in America the summer of an enormous piety binge, a purity binge, when terrorism\u0097which had replaced communism as the prevailing threat to the country's security\u0097was succeeded by cocksucking, and a virile, youthful middle-aged president and a brash, smitten twenty-one-year-old employee carrying on in the Oval Office like two teenage kids in a parking lot revived America's oldest communal passion, historically perhaps its most treacherous and subversive pleasure: the ecstasy of sanctimony. In the Congress, in the press, and on the networks, the righteous grandstanding creeps, crazy to blame, deplore, and punish, were everywhere out moralizing to beat the band: all of them in a calculated frenzy with what Hawthorne (who, in the 1860s, lived not many miles from my door) identified in the incipient country of long ago as \"the persecuting spirit\"; all of them eager to enact the astringent rituals of purification that would excise the erection from the executive branch, thereby making things cozy and safe enough for Senator Lieberman's ten-year-old daughter to watch TV with her embarrassed daddy again. No, if you haven't lived through 1998, you don't know what sanctimony is. The syndicated conservative newspaper columnist William F. Buckley wrote, \"When Abelard did it, it was possible to prevent its happening again,\" insinuating that the president's malfeasance\u0097what Buckley elsewhere called Clinton's \"incontinent carnality\"\u0097might best be remedied with nothing so bloodless as impeachment but, rather, by the twelfth-century punishment meted out to Canon Abelard by the knife-wielding associates of Abelard's ecclesiastical colleague, Canon Fulbert, for Abelard's secret seduction of and marriage to Fulbert's niece, the virgin Heloise. Unlike Khomeini's fatwa condemning to death Salman Rushdie, Buckley's wistful longing for the corrective retribution of castration carried with it no financial incentive for any prospective perpetrator. It was prompted by a spirit no less exacting than the ayatollah's, however, and in behalf of no less exalted ideals. It was the summer in America when the nausea returned, when the joking didn't stop, when the speculation and the theorizing and the hyperbole didn't stop, when the moral obligation to explain to one's children about adult life was abrogated in favor of maintaining in them every illusion about adult life, when the smallness of people was simply crushing, when some kind of demon had been unleashed in the nation and, on both sides, people wondered \"Why are we so crazy?,\" when men and women alike, upon awakening in the morning, discovered that during the night, in a state of sleep that transported them beyond envy or loathing, they had dreamed of the brazenness of Bill Clinton. I myself dreamed of a mammoth banner, draped dadaistically like a Christo wrapping from one end of the White House to the other and bearing the legend a human being lives here. It was the summer when\u0097for the billionth time\u0097the jumble, the mayhem, the mess proved itself more subtle than this one's ideology and that one's morality. It was the summer when a president's penis was on everyone's mind, and life, in all its shameless impurity, once again confounded America. Sometimes on a Saturday, Coleman Silk would give me a ring and invite me to drive over from my side of the mountain after dinner to listen to music, or to play, for a penny a point, a little gin rummy, or to sit in his living room for a couple of hours and sip some cognac and help him get through what was always for him the worst night of the week. By the summer of 1998, he had been alone up here\u0097alone in the large old white clapboard house where he'd raised four children with his wife, Iris\u0097for close to two years, ever since Iris suffered a stroke and died overnight while he was in the midst of battling with the college over a charge of racism brought against him by two students in one of his classes. Coleman had by then been at Athena almost all his academic life, an outgoing, sharp-witted, forcefully smooth big-city charmer, something of a warrior, something of an operator, hardly the prototypical pedantic professor of Latin and Greek (as witness the Conversational Greek and Latin Club that he started, heretically, as a young instructor). His venerable survey course in ancient Greek literature in translation\u0097known as GHM, for Gods, Heroes, and Myth\u0097was popular with students precisely because of everything direct, frank, and unacademically forceful in his comportment. \"You know how European literature begins?\" he'd ask, after having taken the roll at the first class meeting. \"With a quarrel. All of European literature springs from a fight.\" And then he picked up his copy of The Iliad and read to the class the opening lines. \"'Divine Muse, sing of the ruinous wrath of Achilles . . . Begin where they first quarreled, Agamemnon the King of men, and great Achilles.' And what are they quarreling about, these two violent, mighty souls? It's as basic as a barroom brawl. They are quarreling over a woman. A girl, really. A girl stolen from her father. A girl abducted in a war. Mia kouri\u0097that is how she is described in the poem. Mia, as in modern Greek, is the indefinite article 'a'; kouri, or girl, evolves in modern Greek into kori, meaning daughter. Now, Agamemnon much prefers this girl to his wife, Clytemnestra. 'Clytemnestra is not as good as she is,' he says, 'neither in face nor in figure.' That puts directly enough, does it not, why he doesn't want to give her up? When Achilles demands that Agamemnon return the girl to her father in order to assuage Apollo, the god who is murderously angry about the circumstances surrounding her abduction, Agamemnon refuses: he'll agree only if Achilles gives him his girl in exchange. Thus reigniting Achilles. Adrenal Achilles: the most highly flammable of explosive wildmen any writer has ever enjoyed portraying; especially where his prestige and his appetite are concerned, the most hypersensitive killing machine in the history of warfare. Celebrated Achilles: alienated and estranged by a slight to his honor. Great heroic Achilles, who, through the strength of his rage at an insult\u0097the insult of not getting the girl\u0097isolates himself, positions himself defiantly outside the very society whose glorious protector he is and whose need of him is enormous. A quarrel, then, a brutal quarrel over a young girl and her young body and the delights of sexual rapacity: there, for better or worse, in this offense against the phallic entitlement, the phallic dignity, of a powerhouse of a warrior prince, is how the great imaginative literature of Europe begins, and that is why, close to three thousand years later, we are going to begin there today . . .\" Coleman was one of a handful of Jews on the Athena faculty when he was hired and perhaps among the first of the Jews permitted to teach in a classics department anywhere in America; a few years earlier, Athena's solitary Jew had been E. I. Lonoff, the all-but-forgotten short story writer whom, back when I was myself a newly published apprentice in trouble and eagerly seeking the validation of a master, I had once paid a memorable visit to here. Through the eighties and into the nineties, Coleman was also the first and only Jew ever to serve at Athena as dean of faculty; then, in 1995, after retiring as dean in order to round out his career back in the classroom, he resumed teaching two of his courses under the aegis of the combined languages and literature program that had absorbed the Classics Department and that was run by Professor Delphine Roux. As dean, and with the full support of an ambitious new president, Coleman had taken an antiquated, backwater, Sleepy Hollowish college and, not without steamrolling, put an end to the place as a gentlemen's farm by aggressively encouraging the deadwood among the faculty's old guard to seek early retirement, recruiting ambitious young assistant professors, and revolutionizing the curriculum. It's almost a certainty that had he retired, without incident, in his own good time, there would have been the festschrift, there would have been the institution of the Coleman Silk Lecture Series, there would have been a classical studies chair established in his name, and perhaps\u0097given his importance to the twentieth-century revitalization of the place\u0097the humanities building or even North Hall, the college's landmark, would have been renamed in his honor after his death. In the small academic world where he had lived the bulk of his life, he would have long ceased to be resented or controversial or even feared, and, instead, officially glorified forever. It was about midway into his second semester back as a full-time professor that Coleman spoke the self-incriminating word that would cause him voluntarily to sever all ties to the college-the single self-incriminating word of the many millions spoken aloud in his years of teaching and administering at Athena, and the word that, as Coleman understood things, directly led to his wife's death. The class consisted of fourteen students. Coleman had taken attendance at the beginning of the first several lectures so as to learn their names. As there were still two names that failed to elicit a response by the fifth week into the semester, Coleman, in the sixth week, opened the session by asking, \"Does anyone know these people? Do they exist or are they spooks?\" Later that day he was astonished to be called in by his successor, the new dean of faculty, to address the charge of racism brought against him by the two missing students, who turned out to be black, and who, though absent, had quickly learned of the locution in which he'd publicly raised the question of their absence. Coleman told the dean, \"I was referring to their possibly ectoplasmic character. Isn't that obvious? These two students had not attended a single class. That's all I knew about them. I was using the word in its customary and primary meaning: 'spook' as a specter or a ghost. I had no idea what color these two students might be. I had known perhaps fifty years ago but had wholly forgotten that 'spooks' is an invidious term sometimes applied to blacks. Otherwise, since I am totally meticulous regarding student sensibilities, I would never have used that word. Consider the context: Do they exist or are they spooks? The charge of racism is spurious. It is preposterous. My colleagues know it is preposterous and my students know it is preposterous. The issue, the only issue, is the nonattendance of these two students and their flagrant and inexcusable neglect of work. What's galling is that the charge is not just false\u0097it is spectacularly false.\" Having said altogether enough in his defense, considering the matter closed, he left for home. Now, even ordinary deans, I am told, serving as they do in a no man's land between the faculty and the higher administration, invariably make enemies. They don't always grant the salary raises that are requested or the convenient parking places that are so coveted or the larger offices professors believe they are entitled to. Candidates for appointments or promotion, especially in weak departments, are routinely rejected. Departmental petitions for additional faculty positions and secretarial help are almost always turned down, as are requests for reduced teaching loads and for freedom from early morning classes. Funds for travel to academic conferences are regularly denied, et cetera, et cetera. But Coleman had been no ordinary dean, and who he got rid of and how he got rid of them, what he abolished and what he established, and how audaciously he performed his job into the teeth of tremendous resistance succeeded in more than merely slighting or offending a few odd ingrates and malcontents. Under the protection of Pierce Roberts, the handsome young hotshot president with all the hair who came in and appointed him to the deanship\u0097and who told him, \"Changes are going to be made, and anybody who's unhappy should just think about leaving or early retirement\"\u0097Coleman had overturned everything. When, eight years later, midway through Coleman's tenure, Roberts accepted a prestigious Big Ten presidency, it was on the strength of a reputation for all that had been achieved at Athena in record time\u0097achieved, however, not by the glamorous president who was essentially a fund-raiser, who'd taken none of the hits and moved on from Athena heralded and unscathed, but by his determined dean of faculty. In the very first month he was appointed dean, Coleman had invited every faculty member in for a talk, including several senior professors who were the scions of the old county families who'd founded and originally endowed the place and who themselves didn't really need the money but gladly accepted their salaries. Each of them was instructed beforehand to bring along his or her c.v., and if someone didn't bring it, because he or she was too grand, Coleman had it in front of him on his desk anyway. And for a full hour he kept them there, sometimes even longer, until, having so persuasively indicated that things at Athena had at long last changed, he had begun to make them sweat. Nor did he hesitate to open the interview by flipping through the c.v. and saying, \"For the last eleven years, just what have you been doing?\" And when they told him, as an overwhelming number of the faculty did, that they'd been publishing regularly in Athena Notes, when he'd heard one time too many about the philological, bibliographical, or archaeological scholarly oddment each of them annually culled from an ancient Ph.D. dissertation for \"publication\" in the mimeographed quarterly bound in gray cardboard that was cataloged nowhere on earth but in the college library, he was reputed to have dared to break the Athena civility code by saying, \"In other words, you people recycle your own trash.\" Not only did he then shut down Athena Notes by returning the tiny bequest to the donor\u0097the father-in-law of the editor\u0097but, to encourage early retirement, he forced the deadest of the deadwood out of the courses they'd been delivering by rote for the last twenty or thirty years and into freshman English and the history survey and the new freshman orientation program held during the hot last days of the summer. He eliminated the ill-named Scholar of the Year Prize and assigned the thousand dollars elsewhere. For the first time in the college's history, he made people apply formally, with a detailed project description, for paid sabbatical leave, which was more often than not denied. He got rid of the clubby faculty lunchroom, which boasted the most exquisite of the paneled oak interiors on the campus, converted it back into the honors seminar room it was intended to be, and made the faculty eat in the cafeteria with the students. He insisted on faculty meetings\u0097never holding them had made the previous dean enormously popular. Coleman had attendance taken by the faculty secretary so that even the eminences with the three-hour-a-week schedules were forced onto the campus to show up. He found a provision in the college constitution that said there were to be no executive committees, and arguing that those stodgy impediments to serious change had grown up only by convention and tradition, he abolished them and ruled these faculty meetings by fiat, using each as an occasion to announce what he was going to do next that was sure to stir up even more resentment. Under his leadership, promotion became difficult\u0097and this, perhaps, was the greatest shock of all: people were no longer promoted through rank automatically on the basis of being popular teachers, and they didn't get salary increases that weren't tied to merit. In short, he brought in competition, he made the place competitive, which, as an early enemy noted, \"is what Jews do.\" And whenever an angry ad hoc committee was formed to go and complain to Pierce Roberts, the president unfailingly backed Coleman. In the Roberts years all the bright younger people he recruited loved Coleman because of the room he was making for them and because of the good people he began hiring out of graduate programs at Johns Hopkins and Yale and Cornell\u0097\"the revolution of quality,\" as they themselves liked to describe it. They prized him for taking the ruling elite out of their little club and threatening their self-presentation, which never fails to drive a pompous professor crazy. All the older guys who were the weakest part of the faculty had survived on the ways that they thought of themselves\u0097the greatest scholar of the year 100 b.c., and so forth\u0097and once those were challenged from above, their confidence eroded and, in a matter of a few years, they had nearly all disappeared. Heady times! But after Pierce Roberts moved on to the big job at Michigan, and Haines, the new president, came in with no particular loyalty to Coleman\u0097and, unlike his predecessor, exhibiting no special tolerance for the brand of bulldozing vanity and autocratic ego that had cleaned the place out in so brief a period\u0097and as the young people Coleman had kept on as well as those he'd recruited began to become the veteran faculty, a reaction against Dean Silk started to set in. How strong it was he had never entirely realized until he counted all the people, department by department, who seemed to be not at all displeased that the word the old dean had chosen to characterize his two seemingly nonexistent students was definable not only by the primary dictionary meaning that he maintained was obviously the one he'd intended but by the pejorative racial meaning that had sent his two black students to lodge their complaint. I remember clearly that April day two years back when Iris Silk died and the insanity took hold of Coleman. Other than to offer a nod to one or the other of them whenever our paths crossed down at the general store or the post office, I had not really known the Silks or anything much about them before then. I hadn't even known that Coleman had grown up some four or five miles away from me in the tiny Essex County town of East Orange, New Jersey, and that, as a 1944 graduate of East Orange High, he had been some six years ahead of me in my neighboring Newark school. Coleman had made no effort to get to know me, nor had I left New York and moved into a two-room cabin set way back in a field on a rural road high in the Berkshires to meet new people or to join a new community. The invitations I received during my first months out here in 1993\u0097to come to a dinner, to tea, to a cocktail party, to trek to the college down in the valley to deliver a public lecture or, if I preferred, to talk informally to a literature class\u0097I politely declined, and after that both the neighbors and the college let me be to live and do my work on my own. But then, on that afternoon two years back, having driven directly from making arrangements for Iris's burial, Coleman was at the side of my house, banging on the door and asking to be let in. Though he had something urgent to ask, he couldn't stay seated for more than thirty seconds to clarify what it was. He got up, sat down, got up again, roamed round and round my workroom, speaking loudly and in a rush, even menacingly shaking a fist in the air when\u0097erroneously\u0097he believed emphasis was needed. I had to write something for him\u0097he all but ordered me to. If he wrote the story in all of its absurdity, altering nothing, nobody would believe it, nobody would take it seriously, people would say it was a ludicrous lie, a self-serving exaggeration, they would say that more than his having uttered the word \"spooks\" in a classroom had to lie behind his downfall. But if I wrote it, if a professional writer wrote it . . . All the restraint had collapsed within him, and so watching him, listening to him\u0097a man I did not know, but clearly someone accomplished and of consequence now completely unhinged\u0097was like being present at a bad highway accident or a fire or a frightening explosion, at a public disaster that mesmerizes as much by its improbability as by its grotesqueness. The way he careened around the room made me think of those familiar chickens that keep on going after having been beheaded. His head had been lopped off, the head encasing the educated brain of the once unassailable faculty dean and classics professor, and what I was witnessing was the amputated rest of him spinning out of control. I\u0097whose house he had never before entered, whose very voice he had barely heard before\u0097had to put aside whatever else I might be doing and write about how his enemies at Athena, in striking out at him, had instead felled her. Creating their false image of him, calling him everything that he wasn't and could never be, they had not merely misrepresented a professional career conducted with the utmost seriousness and dedication\u0097they had killed his wife of over forty years. Killed her as if they'd taken aim and fired a bullet into her heart. I had to write about this \"absurdity,\" that \"absurdity\"\u0097I, who then knew nothing about his woes at the college and could not even begin to follow the chronology of the horror that, for five months now, had engulfed him and the late Iris Silk: the punishing immersion in meetings, hearings, and interviews, the documents and letters submitted to college officials, to faculty committees, to a pro bono black lawyer representing the two students . . . the charges, denials, and countercharges, the obtuseness, ignorance, and cynicism, the gross and deliberate misinterpretations, the laborious, repetitious explanations, the prosecutorial questions\u0097and always, perpetually, the pervasive sense of unreality. \"Her murder!\" Coleman cried, leaning across my desk and hammering on it with his fist. \"These people murdered Iris!\" The face he showed me, the face he placed no more than a foot from my own, was by now dented and lopsided and\u0097for the face of a well-groomed, youthfully handsome older man\u0097strangely repellent, more than likely distorted from the toxic effect of all the emotion coursing through him. It was, up close, bruised and ruined like a piece of fruit that's been knocked from its stall in the marketplace and kicked to and fro along the ground by the passing shoppers. There is something fascinating about what moral suffering can do to someone who is in no obvious way a weak or feeble person. It's more insidious even than what physical illness can do, because there is no morphine drip or spinal block or radical surgery to alleviate it. Once you're in its grip, it's as though it will have to kill you for you to be free of it. Its raw realism is like nothing else. Murdered. For Coleman that alone explained how, out of nowhere, the end could have come to an energetic sixty-four-year-old woman of commanding presence and in perfect health, an abstract painter whose canvases dominated the local art shows and who herself autocratically administered the town artists' association, a poet published in the county newspaper, in her day the college's leading politically active opponent of bomb shelters, of strontium 90, eventually of the Vietnam War, opinionated, unyielding, impolitic, an imperious whirlwind of a woman recognizable a hundred yards away by her great tangled wreath of wiry white hair; so strong a person, apparently, that despite his own formidableness, the dean who reputedly could steamroll anybody, the dean who had done the academically impossible by bringing deliverance to Athena College, could best his own wife at nothing other than tennis. Once Coleman had come under attack, however\u0097once the racist charge had been taken up for investigation, not only by the new dean of faculty but by the college's small black student organization and by a black activist group from Pittsfield\u0097the outright madness of it blotted out the million difficulties of the Silks' marriage, and that same imperiousness that had for four decades clashed with his own obstinate autonomy and resulted in the unending friction of their lives, Iris placed at the disposal of her husband's cause. Though for years they had not slept in the same bed or been able to endure very much of the other's conversation\u0097or of the other's friends\u0097the Silks were side by side again, waving their fists in the faces of people they hated more profoundly than, in their most insufferable moments, they could manage to hate each other. All they'd had in common as comradely lovers forty years earlier in Greenwich Village\u0097when he was at NYU finishing up his Ph.D. and Iris was an escapee fresh from two nutty anarchist parents in Passaic and modeling for life drawing classes at the Art Students League, armed already with her thicket of important hair, big-featured and voluptuous, already then a theatrical-looking high priestess in folkloric jewelry, the biblical high priestess from before the time of the synagogue\u0097all they'd had in common in those Village days (except for the erotic passion) once again broke wildly out into the open . . . until the morning when she awakened with a ferocious headache and no feeling in one of her arms. Coleman rushed her to the hospital, but by the next day she was dead. \"They meant to kill me and they got her instead.\" So Coleman told me more than once during that unannounced visit to my house, and then made sure to tell every single person at her funeral the following afternoon. And so he still believed. He was not susceptible to any other explanation. Ever since her death\u0097and since he'd come to recognize that his ordeal wasn't a subject I wished to address in my fiction and he had accepted back from me all the documentation dumped on my desk that day\u0097he had been at work on a book of his own about why he had resigned from Athena, a nonfiction book he was calling Spooks. There's a small FM station over in Springfield that on Saturday nights, from six to midnight, takes a break from the regular classical programming and plays big-band music for the first few hours of the evening and then jazz later on. On my side of the mountain you get nothing but static tuning to that frequency, but on the slope where Coleman lives the reception's fine, and on the occasions when he'd invite me for a Saturday evening drink, all those sugary-sweet dance tunes that kids of our generation heard continuously over the radio and played on the jukeboxes back in the forties could be heard coming from Coleman's house as soon as I stepped out of my car in his driveway. Coleman had it going full blast not just on the living room stereo receiver but on the radio beside his bed, the radio beside the shower, and the radio beside the kitchen bread box. No matter what he might be doing around the house on a Saturday night, until the station signed off at midnight\u0097following a ritual weekly half hour of Benny Goodman\u0097he wasn't out of earshot for a minute. Oddly, he said, none of the serious stuff he'd been listening to all his adult life put him into emotional motion the way that old swing music now did: \"Everything stoical within me unclenches and the wish not to die, never to die, is almost too great to bear. And all this,\" he explained, \"from listening to Vaughn Monroe.\" Some nights, every line of every song assumed a significance so bizarrely momentous that he'd wind up dancing by himself the shuffling, drifting, repetitious, uninspired, yet wonderfully serviceable, mood- making fox trot that he used to dance with the East Orange High girls on whom he pressed, through his trousers, his first meaningful erections; and while he danced, nothing he was feeling, he told me, was simulated, neither the terror (over extinction) nor the rapture (over \"You sigh, the song begins. You speak, and I hear violins\"). The teardrops were all spontaneously shed, however astonished he may have been by how little resistance he had to Helen O'Connell and Bob Eberly alternately delivering the verses of \"Green Eyes,\" however much he might marvel at how Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey were able to transform him into the kind of assailable old man he could never have expected to be. \"But let anyone born in 1926,\" he'd say, \"try to stay alone at home on a Saturday night in 1998 and listen to Dick Haymes singing 'Those Little White Lies.' Just have them do that, and then let them tell me afterwards if they have not understood at last the celebrated doctrine of the catharsis effected by tragedy.\" Continue",

      "bodyText": "Online auction powerhouse eBay went offline for nearly 11 hours on Wednesday night, disrupting trading and halting auctions. According to the company, the problem was caused by a decision to delay the replacement of new computer equipment because of the Christmas rush. Ebay said it did not expect any material loss from the outage, merely the irritation from customers unable to access their trading accounts. Ebay is the busiest auction site in the world and recent company results showed it had hosted some 68.5m auctions in the previous quarter. The outage isn't the first for eBay, nor the longest. The site was closed for 22 hours in June 1999, thanks to another problem with computing equipment. While most websites wouldn't feel the ire of customers for such a relatively small technical problem, eBay users are often fanatics, and auctions taking place on the site have a time-sensitive element. Bidders compete aggressively in some auctions, waiting until the sale is nearly closed before topping the final bid by pennies. Ebay said that all auctions affected by the technical glitches would be extended by 24 hours, according to company policy. The problems started sometime after 3pm, US eastern time, and continued until nearly 3am.",

This week online auction brand QXL decided to scrap major ad campaigns in favour of a more sales-driven approach. The report criticises online brands for continuing to focus on the \"functional\" aspects of their business such as price or speed of delivery, which offer only short-term competitive advantage, rather than building the essential element of brand \"trust\". It says that even the best-known online brands lag a long way behind traditional brands in terms of the perceived authority and the relevance to consumers' lives that drive purchasing decisions. Jez Frampton, managing director of Interbrand's interactive arm, said: \"Creating pure brand awareness in the early stages is okay, but many dot.coms are now beyond that and need to make unique service promises.\" Interbrand says Tesco's online delivery service, TescoDirect, had attained less than 50% of the customer commitment enjoyed by its supermarket brand. \"Traditional companies are not thinking hard enough about how to put their traditional businesses online,\" said Mr Frampton, \"There needs to be greater understanding of the softer side of why customer might be buying from them.\"",

      "byline": "John Dunford",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Math teachers are nerds, we are told in a survey published this week. Researchers at Plymouth University asked 12 year olds in seven countries for their impressions of their maths teachers. The findings included expressions of the sort of kindness and generosity in which young teenagers specialise when talking about teachers or their parents. </p> <p>Fat, bald nerds with glasses and beards apparently predominate at the front of maths classrooms. These sad figures are apparently seen as unmarried and unstylish, wrinkled from all the hard thinking that they have had to do in order to solve maths problems throughout their lives. At least the teachers in Britain are not seen as gun-toting terrorists, as their counterparts in Finland are. </p> <p>As a maths teacher since 1970, I would like to put in a few good words for me and my colleagues. I cannot really recall anyone who might have been described as a nerd, even by 12 year olds with particularly fertile imaginations. I do recall one maths teacher in the 1970s who bred champion dogs. Both he and his dog were exceptionally hairy and could have fallen into the nerd category, but the dog was said to be the son of the animal in the Dulux advertisements and presumably would have qualified as a pedigree nerd. </p> <p>Normality was the defining characteristic of my many other colleagues over the years - family people mostly, with a good range of interests from swimming and badminton to reading and cooking. They even went to the pub occasionally (when the everlasting marking was finished) and if they looked sad it was either the price of the drinks as a proportion of their teacher's salaries or the quality of the work they had just marked. </p> <p>Why didn't Plymouth University do a survey about English or history teachers, I wonder? There must be something about maths teachers that invites sympathy or derision, or both. The trouble with maths from the pupils' viewpoint, of course, is that their answers are either right or wrong. In English, you can write a reasonably good essay; in history, you can get most of the required answer and feel pleased. Even when you do write a brilliant answer in these subjects, you never seem to get full marks. However, the teachers give you credit, even when you have only got part of the answer. </p> <p>In maths, though, the pupil is often wrong and the teacher is always right. The marks range from zero to full marks and the difference between right and wrong is stark. That can be really irritating for pupils, in whose minds accusations of nerdishness must often surface in maths lessons. </p> <p>There could be an age factor too. I may not find my colleagues nerdish, but I do recall my own maths teachers at school as coming into that category. One in particular, I recall, who wrote the textbook that we were using in some abstract part of A-level maths, was particularly unworldly. We didn't understand him, or his textbook, and the word nerd (had it been invented in the 60s) would have come to mind on days when we were feeling excessively polite. </p> <p>There is, of course, a serious point in this research. We currently have a major crisis in the recruitment of specialist teachers to secondary schools and the most difficult subject in which to recruit is maths. For many years now, the government target for the recruitment of maths teachers has not been met. The country has reached the position where a very high proportion of each year's university maths graduates needs to be recruited into teaching in order to make up for the shortfall in previous years. Unfortunately, this crisis comes at a time when the economy is booming and there are many lucrative careers tempting potential maths teachers away from the classroom. </p> <p> If maths teachers have an image of nerdishness, then lively 21 year olds, with clear memories of their own maths schoolteachers from three years earlier, are less likely to want to enter the teaching profession. </p> <p>So, maths teachers, perhaps we had better smarten up our act after all. Straighten out the wrinkles that, the pupils in the survey believe, come from thinking too hard. Buy some stylish clothes. Shave off the beard. Take the pens out of your top pocket. And stop talking about quadratic equations. </p> <p>On second thoughts, quadratic equations are fascinating and have many interesting applications in science and in the wider world. Let me tell you all about them. </p> <p> Quod erat demonstrandum. </p> <p>\u0095 John Dunford is general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association and was a maths teacher from 1970 until he retired as the head of Durham Johnston comprehensive school in Durham City in 1998.</p>",

Researchers at Plymouth University asked 12 year olds in seven countries for their impressions of their maths teachers. The findings included expressions of the sort of kindness and generosity in which young teenagers specialise when talking about teachers or their parents. Fat, bald nerds with glasses and beards apparently predominate at the front of maths classrooms. These sad figures are apparently seen as unmarried and unstylish, wrinkled from all the hard thinking that they have had to do in order to solve maths problems throughout their lives. At least the teachers in Britain are not seen as gun-toting terrorists, as their counterparts in Finland are. As a maths teacher since 1970, I would like to put in a few good words for me and my colleagues. I cannot really recall anyone who might have been described as a nerd, even by 12 year olds with particularly fertile imaginations. I do recall one maths teacher in the 1970s who bred champion dogs. Both he and his dog were exceptionally hairy and could have fallen into the nerd category, but the dog was said to be the son of the animal in the Dulux advertisements and presumably would have qualified as a pedigree nerd. Normality was the defining characteristic of my many other colleagues over the years - family people mostly, with a good range of interests from swimming and badminton to reading and cooking. They even went to the pub occasionally (when the everlasting marking was finished) and if they looked sad it was either the price of the drinks as a proportion of their teacher's salaries or the quality of the work they had just marked. Why didn't Plymouth University do a survey about English or history teachers, I wonder? There must be something about maths teachers that invites sympathy or derision, or both. The trouble with maths from the pupils' viewpoint, of course, is that their answers are either right or wrong. In English, you can write a reasonably good essay; in history, you can get most of the required answer and feel pleased. Even when you do write a brilliant answer in these subjects, you never seem to get full marks. However, the teachers give you credit, even when you have only got part of the answer. In maths, though, the pupil is often wrong and the teacher is always right. The marks range from zero to full marks and the difference between right and wrong is stark. That can be really irritating for pupils, in whose minds accusations of nerdishness must often surface in maths lessons. There could be an age factor too. I may not find my colleagues nerdish, but I do recall my own maths teachers at school as coming into that category. One in particular, I recall, who wrote the textbook that we were using in some abstract part of A-level maths, was particularly unworldly. We didn't understand him, or his textbook, and the word nerd (had it been invented in the 60s) would have come to mind on days when we were feeling excessively polite. There is, of course, a serious point in this research. We currently have a major crisis in the recruitment of specialist teachers to secondary schools and the most difficult subject in which to recruit is maths. For many years now, the government target for the recruitment of maths teachers has not been met. The country has reached the position where a very high proportion of each year's university maths graduates needs to be recruited into teaching in order to make up for the shortfall in previous years. Unfortunately, this crisis comes at a time when the economy is booming and there are many lucrative careers tempting potential maths teachers away from the classroom. If maths teachers have an image of nerdishness, then lively 21 year olds, with clear memories of their own maths schoolteachers from three years earlier, are less likely to want to enter the teaching profession. So, maths teachers, perhaps we had better smarten up our act after all. Straighten out the wrinkles that, the pupils in the survey believe, come from thinking too hard. Buy some stylish clothes. Shave off the beard. Take the pens out of your top pocket. And stop talking about quadratic equations. On second thoughts, quadratic equations are fascinating and have many interesting applications in science and in the wider world. Let me tell you all about them. Quod erat demonstrandum. \u0095 John Dunford is general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association and was a maths teacher from 1970 until he retired as the head of Durham Johnston comprehensive school in Durham City in 1998.",

The Independent Television Commission said that it had received 81 complaints about the ad in November alone, but decided not to uphold any of them. A series of four ads in Egg's \"Love\" campaign feature 'Rob', an over-familiar Egg representative who appears out of the blue in the daily routines of 'Stuart', an Egg customer. Scenes include Rob washing Stuart's hair in the shower and cuddling up to him in bed saying how much Egg loved him. The ads end with children's voices singing \"Egg and you, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g\". The campaign was created by HHCL &amp; Partners. Complaints alleged that the ads were offensive because of their perceived homosexual references, that Rob was 'sinister', and that the use of the nursery rhyme was inappropriate because of a connection that could be made in people's minds between the behaviour of Rob and the issue of child abuse. The ITC argued that all but one of the series of commercials had been cleared by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre to be shown outside children's programmes. It judged that although some viewers might have found the content distasteful, it did not consider the ads unsuitable for general viewing. The commission said that it \"did not consider that the ads either promoted or stereotyped any form of sexual preference but portrayed Rob as a farcically over-caring Egg rep in order to demonstrate how much Egg cared about its customers.\"",

Viewing figures were up 200,000 on Tuesday night, when the first part took 2.2m.

A repeated Touch of Frost drew 9.1m and a 37% share to ITV from 8-10pm, comfortably seeing off all BBC1 opposition. This included Escape to the Sun, a new docu-soap series following a year in the lives of ex-pats in Benidorm. It took 6.1m and a 25% share from 8.45pm.

      "bodyText": "Britain is developing its own version of a controversial hi-tech bomb, the use of which by the Russians in Chechnya has sparked protests from human rights campaigners, it was reported today. The thermobaric munition uses a massive wave of heat and blast pressure rather than high explosive to destroy buildings and kill humans over a large area. BBC Radio 4's Today programme claimed that the weapon was already in development by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) in Kent and may be in service by 2005. However, a statement given to the programme by the Ministry of Defence suggested that Britain's plans may be less well-advanced. It read: \"We are currently investigating the possibility. It is possible that this might involve a thermobaric solution. We would, of course, ensure that this is fully in accordance with international law.\" But Today claimed that Major Ian Orr, commander of the Army Urban Warfare Training Team, had assured its reporter that development was already under way at DERA. The weapon - the effect of which has been compared to that of a tactical nuclear bomb - has caused concern among the military because it renders conventional body armour useless. And it has sparked protests from human rights campaigners, who claim that it is disproportionate and indiscriminate in its effects, as it causes massive internal injuries to anyone, including innocent civilians, within range of its blast. According to Today, Britain's version of the weapon would be less devastating than the Russian devices used in the Chechen capital Grozny, and would be designed specifically to limit civilian casualties.

In a strongly worded letter sent to Mr Smith, seven broadcasters said they were \"writing to register our strongest concern\" at the lack of any information about the criteria the government is using to approve the launch of five new BBC TV channels including BBC3, BBC4 and two new children's channels. Pulling no punches, they said they had \"a right to expect...our views to be taken properly into account\".

The letter, signed by senior TV figures including BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball and Telewest chief executive Adam Singer, also proposes some changes to the approval criteria for new BBC services. The lobbying group believes the BBC should be required to demonstrate that each new service would be \"distinctive from what already exists in the market\", as well as market failure in that programming area. The BBC's commercial rivals are also asking that the corporation be required to provide \"much more detailed financial, marketing and programming information to enable the industry and relevant regulators to make an informed assessment\" of the impact of any new licence-fee funded service on the market.

Meanwhile, the owner of his old home confirmed that Telewest had missed the appointment to collect the equipment, which was still waiting, and he had not heard from them since. *After Consumer contacts Telewest it collects the box and withdraws its invoices. \"Only if we are unable to retrieve a box after a number of attempts will a customer be asked to cover the cost,\" says a spokesman. \"Mr Wilson will receive a conciliatory letter.\" Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, phone us on 020-7713 4731, send a fax on 020-7239 9933 or email us at consumer@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Hussein Chalayan, British designer of the year and one of the fashion world's brightest stars, has filed for voluntary liquidation, according to reports. According to the US fashion newspaper Women's Wear Daily - an industry bible - Chalayan, 30, is said to owe approximately \u00a3250,000 to various stylists and manufacturers who worked on his last catwalk show, which was held at the Gainsborough studios in London in September. Sources told the newspaper that his six staff, employed by his company Cartesia Ltd, have been laid off and outside contracts have been terminated. The news puts into question whether Chalayan will take part in next month's London fashion week, casting a shadow over the industry's new year. Alongside Alexander McQueen, Chalayan is the leading light of the reinvigorated London fashion industry. An uncompromising conceptualist, Chalayan's shows have become a must-see for foreign press and buyers on the packed international schedule. Last year, the designer stunned audiences with tables that turned into skirts, chair covers that became dresses and frocks made from spun sugar which shattered. Although highly lauded by insiders for their technical brilliance, the label had difficulties translating the critical success into sales, averaging at around \u00a31m a year.

Given the imminent application by the BBC for your approval of its proposed new digital channels, we are writing to register our strongest concern at the lack of any finalised criteria on which these new services will be approved or rejected, and to restate some of the changes which we believe are necessary to the draft proposals for these criteria published in June this year.</p> <p>As you are aware, the BBC's proposed new services will, if approved, have a wide reaching long term impact on commercial broadcasters and the creative industries as a whole. We therefore believe that we have a right to expect, at the very least, a means by which we can understand in detail the implications of any new BBC proposals on our businesses, and to be able to respond in full and with the confidence that our views will be taken properly into account before any final decision is taken. While the Government has already set out its draft proposals in this regard, we have yet to see any firm mechanism put in place. We therefore request that the Guidelines are published as soon as possible, before the BBC makes an application to the DCMS for the approval of its proposed new services, and well before the Government begins further consultation.</p> <p>Early publication of the Guidelines is all the more important, we believe, given that the BBC appears to be implementing its new service proposals prior to your official consent. From our contacts within the industry, as well as the BBC itself, we know that plans for BBC 3, BBC 4 and the children's services are continuing apace. We are extremely concerned that the BBC is behaving as if it had been given tacit consent to build their plans for new services, without the proper process being adhered to. We believe that this is significant because it suggests to us that the new approvals process is perceived as simply a rubber stamping exercise by the BBC and DCMS.</p> <p>As well as our concerns over the implementation of the Guidelines we have, as you may already be aware, also proposed to your officials a number of alterations which will ensure the creation of a truly valid and widely respected method of approving BBC services. In particular, the BBC should be required to demonstrate the value to licence fee payers of each new service by outlining how they would be distinctive from what already exists in the market, and by demonstrating that there is a failure of the market to provide such services. The BBC should be required to provide much more detailed financial, marketing and programming information to enable the industry and relevant regulators to make an informed assessment of what impact each service would have upon the market and the commerical broadcasting companies operating in that market. The industry consultation period should also be lengthened considerably from 15 working days to enable the industry to properly assess the BBC's proposals. In addition, there should be a firm undertaking by the DCMS that no new BBC services will be approved unless the requirements of the EC State aid rules have been satisfied. The approvals mechanism should, therefore, ensure that the BBC provides sufficient information in relation to new services to ensure that the EC Commission and market participants can ascertain whether the new services comply with EC State aid rules.</p> <p>The underlying purpose of all these suggestion is to ensure that, when you come to make a decision about whether or not to approve a new service, you have as much detailed and well balanced evidence as possible to assist you in making that decision.

      "bodyText": "22nd December 2000 Rt Hon Chris Smith MP Re: Approval and scrutiny of BBC New services With the White Paper now published we - the major commercial broadcasters in UK cable, satellite and digital television - note the Government's clear intention to retain the existing approvals mechanism for new BBC public service channels. Given the imminent application by the BBC for your approval of its proposed new digital channels, we are writing to register our strongest concern at the lack of any finalised criteria on which these new services will be approved or rejected, and to restate some of the changes which we believe are necessary to the draft proposals for these criteria published in June this year. As you are aware, the BBC's proposed new services will, if approved, have a wide reaching long term impact on commercial broadcasters and the creative industries as a whole.

      "body": "<p>Ray Walston, who has died aged 83, was short, bald, had a clownish face and a penetrating, strangely articulated voice - ideal to play an extra-terrestrial, which he did from 1963 to 1966 on television in My Favourite Martian. The comic situations derived from Walston's deadpan humour as the character struggles to adapt to a more primitive civilisation, his ability to appear and disappear uncontrollably, read minds, speak to animals and levitate.</p> <p>Walston was a down-to-earth character, who hated to be identified as the Martian for so long. He preferred to be remembered for two hit Broadway - and screen - musicals, South Pacific and Damn Yankees, his roles in Billy Wilder's The Apartment and Kiss Me, Stupid, and a string of character parts.</p> <p>Walston was born in New Orleans, and made his professional debut for the Community Players in Houston, Texas, in 1938, playing Buddy in High Tor. It took him a few years, after working as a printer and reporter, before he returned to the profession. From playing an attendant in the Maurice Evans Hamlet in 1945 in New York, he went on to appear on Broadway in The Front Page, The Alchemist, and Tennessee Williams's Summer And Smoke, before landing the role of the conniving marine, Luther Billis, in the touring production of Rogers and Hammerstein's South Pacific in 1950. He repeated the role for two years at London's Drury Lane, staged by Joshua Logan, who also directed Walston in the 1958 film version. Walston survived Logan's stodgy direction, stealing every scene in which he appeared.</p> <p>Before he made his film debut in 1957 as Cary Grant's naval sidekick in Stanley Donen's Kiss Them For Me, Walston sang in three more Broadway musicals, Rodgers and Hammerstein's Me And Juliet, Harold Arlen's House Of Flowers and George Abbott's Damn Yankees. In the last, for which he received a Tony, and in the 1958 movie, Walston played a deliciously wicked and frustrated Devil in the human form of an entrepreneur called Mr Applegate, stopping the show with Those Were The Good Old Days.</p> <p>In 1960, Walston made The Apartment, in which he was one of the bosses using underling Jack Lemmon's pad for assignations; a shifty chauffeur bringing some reality into the risible soap opera Portrait in Black; a title character in Convicts 4, and a professor trying to help student Anthony Perkins pass an exam to permit him to play in a basketball game in Josh Logan's Tall Story.</p> <p>In 1963 Walston appeared as Mr Quimby, the shop manager in the Frank Tashlin-Jerry Lewis comedy, Who's Minding The Store?, and returned to the big screen in Kiss Me, Stupid (1964). He got the part of Orville J Spooner when Peter Sellers suffered a heart attack. \"Both my wife and I sat down and read the script,\" Walston recalled, \"and I said when I finished it, 'It's not good, it's not good.' But one doesn't say that about a Billy Wilder- IAL Diamond script. The feeling was that they would repair it.\" They did, and Walston was amusing as a jealous piano teacher and would-be songwriter in Climax, Nevada, who sends his wife away while horny crooner Dean Martin is staying with him, hiring local hooker Kim Novak to play his wife.</p> <p>\"I had a line, when I first bring Kim Novak into the house: 'Well, it's not very big but it's clean.' And they wanted it done with a slight look from her as if it meant my cock. 'Hey, Ray,' Wilder said. 'Vat are the keedies gonna tink about you ven this film is released?'</p> <p>\"I replied, 'What are people gonna say about you? How do you think you're gonna get away with some of this stuff?' \"</p> <p>IAL Diamond's wife had her own thoughts: \"They should have waited for Peter Sellers to recover, Ray Walston was too unattractive a personality.\" She was right in that Walston seldom heeded the exhortatory song You Gotta Have Heart from Damn Yankees, his performances tending towards caricature.</p> <p>Walston worked on into the 1990s playing the race announcer in on a scam in The Sting (1973), one of the two killers pursuing Gene Wilder in Silver Streak (1976), Poopdeck Pappy in Robert Altman's Popeye (1981), and the quirky schoolteacher in Fast Times At Ridgemont High (1982), a part he repeated in the TV series Fast Times. Aged 75, Walston gave one of his best, and warmest, performances in Of Mice And Men (1992) as the veteran farmworker Candy, heartbroken at his old dog having to be put down.</p> <p>Walston is survived by his wife, daughter and two grandchildren.</p>",

While Morecambe brims with excitement over the impending visit of Ipswich Town, Bowen claims to have already taken care of the brown envelopes - again. </p> <p>There has always been a show business feel to this Lancashire seaside town. Eric Bartholomew was a previous president, long after changing his name to Morecambe, and a statue now stands in the town in his memory. For the past five years, Bowen, whose 14 years as a game-show host on Bullseye made him a national institution, has ensured that life in the Conference has never been short of fun. </p> <p>\"When we played Cambridge United in the second round, I joked that we'd left a brown envelope in the referee's room,\" said Bowen yesterday. \"The ref, Mr Parkes, was petrified that he'd be summoned to Soho Square to answer for his career. The last 16 minutes, after we'd gone 2-1 up, were the most harrowing of my life.\" </p> <p>Mark Quayle's goal had put Morecambe in round three for only the second time in their 80-year history. Looking ahead Jim Harvey, the Morecambe manager as well as being Sammy McIlroy's No2 at Northern Ireland, said: \"Ipswich hold no fears for me. In the last few months I've had to help prepare for matches against Yugoslavia, Denmark and Hungary. </p> <p>\"If we can hang on until the last 10 minutes on Saturday, it could be very interesting.\" </p> <p>Bowen takes another view and warns Ipswich that travellers' cheques are already on the way to the referee and that if the result goes the right way, the fourth official can anticipate a weekend in Llandudno. They have always gone about things strangely in Morecambe; the club existed for almost 30 years without a manager. </p> <p>Bowen's love of football was first formed in Accrington - \"If you're not sure where it is, it's where the M65 is cobbled\" - and then as a supporter of Blackburn Rovers. \"If you stood on concrete on the terraces in the 50s, you were a capitalist,\" he said. He remembered Jack Walker, who was later to commit his millions to buying Rovers a Premiership title, enjoying particular favour. \"The rest of us were on mud, but Jack had his own rail and stood leeward of a concrete barrier. By the time that Jack got his pie at half-time, it was still hot.\" </p> <p>Bowen's first job was as a dustman, until national service intervened. \"I defended my country at Shrewsbury,\" he said. \"Our task was to keep the Welsh out. The sheep up here in Lancashire are frightened enough as it is.\" He was made a physical-training instructor - \"To keep me away from the live ammunition\" - and qualified as a teacher in 1959. </p> <p>\"My role is to speak at a few sportsmen's dinners and raise a bit of money, but I understand the game reasonably well, and even took a brief coaching course at Lilleshall. I used to be a winger, because that was where they used to put the kid with glasses and skinny legs. I suffered from a lack of confidence. I played in the under-15s. I was 19 at the time,\" he said. </p> <p>Around the time that Bowen took up teaching, Morecambe were enjoying a renaissance. Ray Charnley, later to play for England, was sold to Blackpool; Christie Park was treated to floodlights, a supporters' club plus a new stand, and in 1961-2, an FA Cup third round tie against Weymouth drew a record crowd of 9,234. Their finest hour was in 1974 when they beat Dartford at Wembley in the FA Trophy final. </p> <p>The visit of Ipswich, fourth in the Premiership, is an opportunity to scale new heights. Bowen is relying on adrenalin to \"get them the extra yard\" and \"a bottle of Scotch in the dressing room that we won't even charge them for\". </p> <p>At \"63 going on 107\" Morecambe's honorary president still leads a hectic life. His morning show with Sally Naden on BBC Radio Lancashire, The Happy Daft Farm, dominates ratings. Its avowed aim is to find the most miserable people in Lancashire and cheer them up. \"The BBC,\" says Bowen, \"have finally heightened my awareness that money isn't everything.\" Next summer, Bowen has been re-engaged on the QE2, where he will play trumpet with Colin Bryant's Hot Rhythm Orchestra. </p> <p>But it is for his role on Bullseye, the darts quiz show, for which Bowen is remembered with affection. His Sunday afternoon slot peaked at 18.9m viewers and was revered by grannies and students alike. Here was the maths teacher who could not add up, and who once uttered \"smashing\" 43 times in one half-hour programme. \"It was the happiest 14 years of my showbiz life.\" </p> <p>Thoughts of an FA Cup win drew from Bowen the ultimate accolade. \"Tell you what, if we beat Ipswich, it'll be even better than a speedboat.\"</p>",

Around the time that Bowen took up teaching, Morecambe were enjoying a renaissance. Ray Charnley, later to play for England, was sold to Blackpool; Christie Park was treated to floodlights, a supporters' club plus a new stand, and in 1961-2, an FA Cup third round tie against Weymouth drew a record crowd of 9,234. Their finest hour was in 1974 when they beat Dartford at Wembley in the FA Trophy final. The visit of Ipswich, fourth in the Premiership, is an opportunity to scale new heights. Bowen is relying on adrenalin to \"get them the extra yard\" and \"a bottle of Scotch in the dressing room that we won't even charge them for\". At \"63 going on 107\" Morecambe's honorary president still leads a hectic life. His morning show with Sally Naden on BBC Radio Lancashire, The Happy Daft Farm, dominates ratings. Its avowed aim is to find the most miserable people in Lancashire and cheer them up. \"The BBC,\" says Bowen, \"have finally heightened my awareness that money isn't everything.\" Next summer, Bowen has been re-engaged on the QE2, where he will play trumpet with Colin Bryant's Hot Rhythm Orchestra. But it is for his role on Bullseye, the darts quiz show, for which Bowen is remembered with affection. His Sunday afternoon slot peaked at 18.9m viewers and was revered by grannies and students alike. Here was the maths teacher who could not add up, and who once uttered \"smashing\" 43 times in one half-hour programme. \"It was the happiest 14 years of my showbiz life.\" Thoughts of an FA Cup win drew from Bowen the ultimate accolade. \"Tell you what, if we beat Ipswich, it'll be even better than a speedboat.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Fulham football captain, Chris Coleman, faces a fight to save his career after breaking his right leg in several places in a car crash on Tuesday night. The Wales international defender underwent emergency surgery at East Surrey hospital in Redhill where he was said to be comfortable yesterday after crashing his Jaguar through a metal fence and into a tree. Firefighters spent around 45 minutes freeing him and a Surrey fire brigade spokeswoman said crews used cutting equipment to reach him. Coleman was alone and there were no other vehicles involved. Police plan to inter view the former Blackburn player, who was not breathalised at the scene because he was in such pain. An ambulance service spokesman, Russell Kempton, said Coleman had broken his leg in several places between ankle and knee and had an open wound. He had been conscious and in great pain. Coleman's car destroyed 60ft of wrought iron fencing as it careered off the road and uprooted two trees before coming to rest in ditch. Mr Kempton said. \"The driver was trapped for the best part of an hour and it was necessary to give him pain relief.\" \u0095 Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler was said to be \"upset and shocked\" yesterday after apparently being punched in the face in an early morning fracas. He suffered slight face injuries in the attack at a Liverpoool bar which he had allegedly been asked to leave. A 39-year-old man was arrested and has been released on police bail.",

      "bodyText": "David Jones returned to football yesterday when he was appointed as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers 29 days after leaving Chester crown court following the collapse of child-abuse charges and his exoneration by the judge. The 44-year-old Jones, who was also wanted by Barnsley, becomes the First Division club's fifth manager in seven years and has agreed a 3-year contract that ties him to Molineux until 2004. His brief is straightforward but it is one that has proved beyond his immediate predecessors, namely Graham Turner, Graham Taylor, Mark McGhee and Colin Lee: to lead the club to the top flight after an absence of 17 years. It is an objective Jones has not ruled out this season, even though Wolves are languishing in 12th place, 14 points shy of play-off places. \"Why not?\" he asked when he was introduced to the media and a welcoming posse of supporters. \"We have to have something to aim for. When I went to Southampton their priority was to finish fourth from bottom. But what if they failed and finished one place below that? They were out, so why not aim for the top?\" It was his positive style that enabled Jones to see off the claims of Dave Bassett and another 50 applicants to succeed Lee, who was sacked just before Christmas. \"The board's decision was unanimous and it was Jones's determination and desire to manage Wolves that tipped the scales in his favour,\" said the club's managing director Jez Moxey. Wolves were also impressed by the way Jones dealt with his personal ordeal. \"We have seen his resilience in a difficult time and we believe he can use this to make Wolverhampton Wanderers successful and get us promoted,\" Moxey added. And after 17 years of waiting, Wolves will also be delighted to have come across a manager who has wasted little time in returning to work and is in even more of a hurry to get back to the Premiership. \"I had no control of what went on at Southampton,\" said Jones, who was paid off by them against his will so that he could concentrate on clearing his name. \"They made a decision I didn't agree with it but I understand why they had to do it. I felt I shouldn't have been out of the Premiership and I want to get back there.\" Such undisguised ambition suggests Jones sees this job as a route to higher things but he rejects such suggestions. In fact, reading between the lines, Jones regards under-achieving Wolves as the biggest club he has managed. \"Someone said to me, you can use Wolves as a stepping stone to get to a bigger club. This is not a big club, it's a massive club. I compare it with the one I played at - Everton. And if it gets into the Premiership how many bigger clubs are there?\" Once that is achieved, Jones will still not be satisfied. \"When, not if, this club gets in the Premiership that will still not be enough.

Concern that the MMR jab could be linked to autism and other problems have led to immunisation levels falling to a dangerously low level, the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) said. Now the new intake of four-year-olds into Britain's primary schools contains high numbers who have not been vaccinated, which could trigger a major outbreak of the disease. In Dublin - where there has been a similar drop in the take-up of MMR - two children have died and hundreds more have been ill. For the MMR vaccine to be effective, 95% of the child population must have the jab to ensure so-called \"herd immunity\" for everyone. But reports three years ago showing a possible link to autism and other problems have caused immunisation levels to fall to 88% and to as low as 75% in some parts of London. That means as many as one in four children in some age groups may not be protected against measles, which can cause death or permanent brain damage.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The major change in attitudes to breast cancer can be credited to women such as Betty Westgate, founder and president of Breast Cancer Care, who has died aged 81. In 1968, this small, outgoing biology teacher had a biopsy for a lump in the breast. It was diagnosed as benign, but a week later she was told it was not, and that she would be having a mastectomy. She knew little about breast cancer, and when she asked a doctor about the operation, he reacted as though he could not understand her need to know. </p> <p>Later, after five weeks of radiotherapy, another doctor told her how marvellous it was that women could survive five or even more years after a mastectomy. Resentment and anger at this casual death sentence fired Betty with the determination to live for another 30 years. The myths, inaccuracies and superstitions surrounding breast cancer led her into a major reading and learning programme. </p> <p>In 1972 she founded Cancer Education Voluntary Service, offering a talk called \"Lumps and Bumps\" to groups. From the questions asked, she recognised the need for an organisation giving non-medical help and post-operative information. Since it did not exist, she set up one herself, and called it the Mastectomy Association. </p> <p>Born in Wiltshire but educated in Croydon, Betty first ran the campaign from her Croydon home, helped by her husband Jim, a chief mechanical engineer at London Transport, whom she married in 1940. When finance became a problem she sought funding, and from 1977 received an annual grant from the Department of Health. In 1981, she found funding for an office and paid staff. In 1994 the name was changed to Breast Cancer Care (BCC). </p> <p>What was extraordinary was the range of Betty's understanding of the many facets of breast cancer and her ability to understand women's needs. In the 70s, post-operative women were advised to stuff handkerchiefs, cotton wool which disintegrated, or even tights into their bras; breast forms were few in size and could be lumpy. In 1974 Betty designed the \"Cumfie\", which was washable, spin-dryable, supersoft; they were still being made in the 90s. </p> <p>Today, BCC organises fashion parades, but early on Betty saw the need for purpose-designed swimwear and bras. She got VAT removed from them. She also got prostheses made in different sizes and lighter weights. She bared her own scar and prosthesis, and later the implant, to nurses. In the days when a woman needed her doctor to write a letter to approve a breast implant, Betty wrote to a doctor who had suggested that one of his patients did not need one and asked him whether if he lost a testicle he would want an implant. </p> <p>Betty told the story of her campaign in a booklet, Life, Here I Come! It was published in 1998 to celebrate 25 years of the organisation she founded. The title of the book summed up Betty's philosophy. She travelled the world to talk and educate people about the charity. She had a great love of flying, and had trained as a pilot until forced to give it up when she was pregnant with her first child in 1942. When, aged 70, she was told she was too old to go hang-gliding, she was most indignant. </p> <p>She is survived by Jim and her four sons. </p> <p> \u0095Betty Westgate, breast cancer campaigner, born February 19 1919; died December 18 2000</p>",

But the producers of Castaway have revealed that a staggering 13,000 hopefuls have approached them wanting to join the next Castaway programme. Jeremy Mills, joint managing director of Lion TV, who was behind the original programme, was keeping plans for the follow-up, Castaway 2001, close to his chest. But he said the follow-up would definitely not be set on a tropical island. \"We're going to do the same thing, taking a group of people to a place where they will be forced to confront aspects of themselves they might not have dealt with before and address their preconceptions,\" he said. \"But this time we're not going to tell the contestants where they are going or who the other contestants will be before they get there,\" he said. Castaway 2001, which will go into production this summer, will be produced by Lion's Chris Kelly, the man behind the first programme. Meanwhile, two of the stars of the programme, Toby Waterman and Tammy Huff, who fell in love and are now to travel the world together, are believed to be in negotiations with the Mail on Sunday for an exclusive interview. It is thought they have been offered \u00a310,000 each for their story. Ben Fogle, the former Tatler picture editor turned TV heart-throb, has been inundated with offers of television work - including travel shows - and newspaper exclusives. As the most sought-after star, he is being advised by Martine McCutcheon's former agent. Mr Mills also said he was interested in working with some of the Castaway 2000 participants again. \"While the project was going on we weren't able to talk to them about it, but now it's over we will be talking to several of them about working together in an appropriate situation,\" he said.",

      "byline": "Hugo Young",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The epic struggle of 2001 will not be the general election. The election, in the eyes of most participants, is already decided. The details are awaited, including the incalculable size of the Labour majority. And the psyche of politicians requires them never to be certain of anything, so near-panic will always hover. But the struggle that is real and unpredictable will come after. It will be the great story of this year. Its potential for exposing ruinous division in a newly elected government - or else for driving that government to duck a decision history requires of it - is taking, I believe, a new turn.</p> <p>There is no getting away from the euro. After a decent victory, especially if it's big, Tony Blair cannot avoid addressing his commitment to decide whether sterling ought to join. But first he will need to address and resolve the differences between himself and Gordon Brown, differences that show no sign of slackening. They are, if anything, deepening: not, perhaps, as a matter of substance, but as a matter of tactics, bringing into play new definitions of what this decision is all about, and new judgments on whether the British people can be persuaded to back the euro in a referendum.</p> <p>The major assessment of the euro, Mr Blair and Mr Brown have always said, must be economic. Now the five tests that Brown laid down for the economic effects of entry are closer to being met, and arguably are already satisfied. Added to this is the recovery of the euro's market value, which makes it possible to envisage the exchange-rate issue becoming a lot more manageable in the months following the election.</p> <p>But this, of course, is not the end of the story. The core question was, is and always will be political. Is entry, in the larger sense, a good thing? Is it essential to British power and influence, or destructive of same? Do the British want to change their national trajectory in this definitive way? Are we ready, after our dabbling baptism 30 years ago, for the existential plunge we have resisted since the war?</p> <p>Blair's position is now that he has a strong bias for entry. His euro-glass is more than half-full. He needs to believe he can carry a referendum, but the main effect of the Nice summit was to replenish his confidence that he can win the national argument on Europe. He slaughtered William Hague then and, we're assuming, will have done so again at the election. Besides, another landslide victory cannot easily coexist, in his mind, with retreat from the contest he has been holding out as the reason for silencing the euro debate during the election campaign.</p> <p>He also has a historic mission to fulfil. That's another swayer of subjective judgment. He will have secured his first historic goal, the second term, but has often cited the ending of British ambivalence on Europe as the other one. He wants a reformed Europe. He welcomes the retreat of power from Brussels. His Europeanism is pragmatic, realistic, British. He is certain that Britain cannot expect to influence the shape the new Europe takes unless London is a fully participating member of the single currency.</p> <p>Brown's position is different, a bias, I would say, against entry. Not for ever, and not with any trace of the anti- Europeanism of the modern Tory party. Gordon Brown is a serious man. He is perfectly aware of the linkage between the island and continental economies. His scepticism about the euro is not that of the dissembler (David Owen), the nationalist (Michael Portillo) or the fanatic (Margaret Thatcher).</p> <p>But he has developed Thatcher-like traits. The shortcomings of European economies irritate him as much as the brilliance of the American model entrances him. Europe, he believes, still has much to learn, and the lessons are one-way, from Anglo-Saxonry east, never vice versa. The road to a liberalised economy is long, and across the channel has barely begun to be traversed. He knows where it leads, and is magisterially impatient with EU colleagues who have not seen the light.</p> <p>More crucially, the Treasury is developing a political and not just an economic position. This is the change I'm noticing. Maybe it has something to do with the discovery that, in statistical terms, the five economic tests, plus the exchange-rate, are looking positive. But Brown's anxiety about the EU now touches on such issues as its perceived legitimacy and democratic accountability. The European Commission has become a bugbear of, again, Thatcher-like resonance, getting in the way of his schemes for venture capital and regional aid, and even daring to challenge the personal triumph he secured last year against a unified withholding tax.</p> <p>A sixth test, in short, begins to emerge: that the EU should be seen to be more democratically accountable, and not controlled by faceless bureaucrats, before a referendum can safely be held. For no country has won a referendum on the euro. It is a huge political risk, likely to awaken the deeper scepticism that people rightly have about the very legitimacy of the EU as presently run. These issues, the argument goes, are not just the creation of the Sun, the Times and the Mail. They have the capacity, unless we carefully respect them, to wreck what this government has achieved, just as the euro itself, entered at the wrong moment, will put in peril the hard-won prosperity of the Brown chancellorship, not to mention the future career of the man who has yet to be prime minister.</p> <p>On this view, there is, to put it mildly, no urgency about a referendum. Trying to calculate its timing, as is commonly done, by reference to the following election is a tactic of almost contemptible triviality. These issues are much bigger than tactics. Europe needs time, to get both its economy and its politics right, before Labour could recommend Brits to vote for a new kind of future that, among other things, transfers monetary sovereignty to a European central bank that needs more political input. Not only must we be sure of winning, we need serious proof of a national consensus. Hair's-breadth majorities are not enough. I've heard 70% as the desirable minimum \"yes\" before the Treasury would happily plunge.</p> <p>What will happen after the election? The economic assessment, as promised, will be made. The Treasury intends it to be extremely detailed. It passionately believes in its stated tests, and rejects the scorn often heaped on them. What's indisputable, though, is that the verdict can be heavily conditioned by the answer the government wants to hear. If Mr Brown does not revisit his scepticism, and if he wants to set the scene for a referendum that must be at best delayed, he has the means at his disposal.</p> <p>The decisive argument with Mr Blair must therefore happen before the assessment is completed. While the economic benefits of entry can never be \"proved\" either way, the statement of probabilities will vitally affect the environment in which the political choice is made. The smallest hesitation by the Treasury will be seized on as a signal from Brown that Blair cannot ignore. Just as the faintest quiver of Brown's doubting eyelid, once the decision to go ahead is made, would be exploited by the other side, including the sceptic newspapers that have already made him their hero.</p> <p>The broadening of the Brown agenda has not yet been conveyed to 10 Downing Street. Indeed, the post-election scenario has not been deeply thought about there at all, partly because ministers seldom have time to look more than a week ahead, but also because such planning cuts against the conceit on which Blair and Brown do strongly agree, that the euro has no place in the election campaign.</p> <p>It's too early to call Brown's position destructive. For one thing, the referendum does not axiomatically have to happen very soon. Though that's the conventional calculation, it could wait until 2003 if currency-convergence required it, and also to allow more time for Brown's anxieties about the politics to be allayed. Most Labour MPs simply want to get shot of the issue, and would follow the Blair line rather than face another whole parliament of indecision.

Though Blair could carry his cabinet with a summons to arms, there's no critical mass there pushing him to issue one, beyond Messrs Cook, Mandelson, Byers and Hoon.</p> <p>Succumbing to Brown's anxieties would, however, be full of hazard. Wait for the EU to secure democratic legitimacy and you could be dithering for a decade or two. Wait and see how the 2004 intergovernmental conference turns out, with its alternative plans for a constitution, and you've missed the boat this parliament.

      "bodyText": "The epic struggle of 2001 will not be the general election. The election, in the eyes of most participants, is already decided. The details are awaited, including the incalculable size of the Labour majority. And the psyche of politicians requires them never to be certain of anything, so near-panic will always hover. But the struggle that is real and unpredictable will come after. It will be the great story of this year. Its potential for exposing ruinous division in a newly elected government - or else for driving that government to duck a decision history requires of it - is taking, I believe, a new turn. There is no getting away from the euro. After a decent victory, especially if it's big, Tony Blair cannot avoid addressing his commitment to decide whether sterling ought to join. But first he will need to address and resolve the differences between himself and Gordon Brown, differences that show no sign of slackening. They are, if anything, deepening: not, perhaps, as a matter of substance, but as a matter of tactics, bringing into play new definitions of what this decision is all about, and new judgments on whether the British people can be persuaded to back the euro in a referendum. The major assessment of the euro, Mr Blair and Mr Brown have always said, must be economic. Now the five tests that Brown laid down for the economic effects of entry are closer to being met, and arguably are already satisfied. Added to this is the recovery of the euro's market value, which makes it possible to envisage the exchange-rate issue becoming a lot more manageable in the months following the election. But this, of course, is not the end of the story. The core question was, is and always will be political. Is entry, in the larger sense, a good thing? Is it essential to British power and influence, or destructive of same? Do the British want to change their national trajectory in this definitive way? Are we ready, after our dabbling baptism 30 years ago, for the existential plunge we have resisted since the war? Blair's position is now that he has a strong bias for entry. His euro-glass is more than half-full. He needs to believe he can carry a referendum, but the main effect of the Nice summit was to replenish his confidence that he can win the national argument on Europe. He slaughtered William Hague then and, we're assuming, will have done so again at the election. Besides, another landslide victory cannot easily coexist, in his mind, with retreat from the contest he has been holding out as the reason for silencing the euro debate during the election campaign. He also has a historic mission to fulfil. That's another swayer of subjective judgment. He will have secured his first historic goal, the second term, but has often cited the ending of British ambivalence on Europe as the other one. He wants a reformed Europe. He welcomes the retreat of power from Brussels. His Europeanism is pragmatic, realistic, British. He is certain that Britain cannot expect to influence the shape the new Europe takes unless London is a fully participating member of the single currency. Brown's position is different, a bias, I would say, against entry. Not for ever, and not with any trace of the anti- Europeanism of the modern Tory party. Gordon Brown is a serious man. He is perfectly aware of the linkage between the island and continental economies. His scepticism about the euro is not that of the dissembler (David Owen), the nationalist (Michael Portillo) or the fanatic (Margaret Thatcher). But he has developed Thatcher-like traits. The shortcomings of European economies irritate him as much as the brilliance of the American model entrances him. Europe, he believes, still has much to learn, and the lessons are one-way, from Anglo-Saxonry east, never vice versa.

      "body": "<p>When George Bush was Governor of Texas, he called upon the big oil companies, such as Exxon-Mobil, to draw up a draft for the state's Clean Air Act. They came up with a Bill allowing them to regulate themselves. Just as Bush was signing it into law, in December 1988, the town of Odessa - a few miles from his birthplace - was engulfed by a black, toxic smoke so thick that drivers had to use their headlights during daytime. </p> <p>The President they call 'the Toxic Texan' took office on a platform pledging to turn his gubernatorial principles into national policy - to make America a 'greater Texas'. And last week Bush began his attempt to make the world environment that of a 'greater America'. He 'declared war on the environment' - in the words of Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer, both at home and on the international stage. </p> <p>Defying his European allies and many Third World countries, Bush in effect killed off the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 - by which more than 100 nations undertook to reduce emissions of 'greenhouse gases' that cause global warming - turning the US, for environmentalists, into a greedy, polluting pariah. On the domestic front, meanwhile, a series of brazen measures has provoked an outcry from even the most moderate and established of environmental groups. </p> <p>Withdrawal by the US from Kyoto tolls a death knell for the treaty, because although it accounts for only 4 per cent of the world's population, it is responsible for 25 per cent of the emissions of gases that cause the greenhouse effect. Half of America's industrial might still burns fossil fuels and belches out fumes, while Americans themselves drive heavy trucks and cars further than any other people - to the mall and across the infinite landscape - and even the average household boasts 2.8 television sets and a wealth of electrical appliances. </p> <p>The story behind the singular determination of Bush to fly in the face of world opinion, the sentiments of most Americans and even many in his own government reveals adherence to ideological rigour and a payment of debts to the business interests that helped him to the White House - above all, oil and coal. Oil runs through every sinew and vein of the Bush administration; rarely, if ever, has a Western government been so intimately entwined with a single industry. When Bush assumed office, however, oil and other energy industries were in the political cold after eight years of Bill Clinton's environmental record. Prompted by his keenly environmentalist deputy, Al Gore, Clinton had cautiously recommended ratification of Kyoto, but it was flatly rejected in the Senate. </p> <p>Clinton nevertheless put more wilderness under federal protection than any President since Franklin Roosevelt and decreed a sweeping series of anti-pollution, clean air and clean water measures, facing down formidable constituencies such as the timber industry, sugar barons, big utility and automotive lobbies - and, above all, Big Oil and King Coal. </p> <p>Determined backing for Bush was thereby assured from these quarters. According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, $10 million out of $14m in political contributions from oil and gas companies to the last election went to Republican candidates. The Bush family has roots in the oil business, and the President began his own career with a series of unsuccessful drilling ventures bailed out by bigger oil com panies. He was backed by most of the big names in oil, especially Texaco and Exxon-Mobil, in his campaigns for Governor and later President. Bush has now charged his Vice-President Dick Cheney - the pivotal power in the White House - to compile an overall energy policy document due for publication before the completion of his first 100 days in office. Cheney's connections to big oil have been close-knit and especially lucrative. </p> <p>The Pentagon chief under Bush senior, Cheney used connections forged by the Gulf war to open up valuable business for the giant Halliburton Company, of which he was made chief executive in 1995, and which does 70 per cent of its $15 billion sales to Arab governments. Bush's Commerce Secretary, Don Evans, is a long-time personal friend from the President's home town of Midland, Texas, and a man raised in oil. His father was a manager for Shell and he is chairman and chief executive of the Midland-based Tom Brown oil company which, before the Eighties crash, was worth $2bn - equivalent to the Ford Corporation. </p> <p>Among the less well known oil connections are those of America's ambassador to London, Doug Farish, who went into politics as an aide to Bush senior in 1964 and is described by former First Lady Barbara Bush as 'one of the family'. </p> <p>Despite his reclusive image as a rancher who sold horses to the Queen, Farish is a Texas oil magnate from a Texas oil family. His grandfather founded the Humble Oil and Refining Company, part of what is now Exxon, and later became president of Standard Oil. Farish's own dealings in the oil state have not only been in liquid gold but also gas exploration and mining. Bush's break with world opinion on Kyoto was debated and contested within the administration, with Secretary of State Colin Powell and the Treasury reportedly eager to leave a door open to join Britain and other nations in a commitment to reduce 'greenhouse gas' emissions. </p> <p>But even in the State Department, big oil has its man moulding policy: Middle East guru Richard Haas who, with Powell and Cheney, has an aversion to unilateral sanctions that hurt business. </p> <p>Haas hails from the Brookings think-tank, and has propelled America's preparedness to consider easing sanctions on Iraq with a document entitled 'Iraq: A Modified Approach', written by Meghan O'Sullivan, a researcher who worked under Haas at Brookings. The paper argues that embargoes are 'bad for particular businesses' - principally oil - and it emerges that much of Haas's project was funded by Conoco and Arco, with whom he has worked as a consultant. He also has a seat on the board of oil firm, Santa Fe International. With these and other connections in place, big oil was quick to move once Bush was inaugurated. The National Petrochemical Refiners Association lobbied first, for a rollback of clean-air standards for buses and big trucks decreed by Clinton. </p> <p> The association's counsel, Bob Slaughter, said he hoped 'the administration would be more interested in balancing the energy supply and environmental concerns' - and it was: Bush put a moratorium on this and all similar decrees, citing a fear of fuel price rises. Bush had promised to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide, but two weeks ago he reversed this, citing a report commissioned last year by Republican Senator David McIntosh, saying that carbon dioxide restrictions could 'boost electricity prices and hurt coal-fired utilities'. Shortly before the announcement, Washington was blitzed by the 'Coal Based Generators' group to lobby for a reversal on emissions and tax breaks for 'clean coal' utilities. </p> <p>Leading the group was Irl Engelhardt, chairman of Peabody, America's largest coal enterprise, who was also a major Republican contributor and energy adviser to the Bush-Cheney transition team. The same letter that disclosed the volte-face on carbon dioxide also announced the scrapping of new Clinton regulations reducing arsenic levels in drinking water by 80 per cent. The EPA's former administrator for water, Chuck Fox, who drafted the legislation, said: 'This action will jeopardise the health of millions of Americans.' And its backer in Congress, Henry Waxman, called the ruling 'another example of payback to industries that gave millions of dollars in campaign contributions'. </p> <p> Fear of continuing fuel price rises and shrinking supply then dictated the White House's reaction to the energy crisis in California - ironically caused, said the Democrats, by the very deregulation policies favoured by the administration on a national scale. Bush's language - and his catchphrase that 'national security depends on energy security' - turned the crisis into a national emergency which dovetailed into the arguments that tranches of federal land protected by Clinton - including the vast and virgin Arctic wilderness in Alaska - should be opened up for prospecting and drilling. </p> <p>These announcements - as well as Kyoto - have stirred even the most mainstream groups to exasperation, with the executive director of the Sierra Club - equivalent to the National Trust - predicting 'a very major fight'. Two entwined schools of thought form the core of the Bush administration: deregulation and decentralisation. The underpinning ideology is the injection of market forces into management of the public domain, and the belief that industry should police itself. Supporters of last week's decision include David Victor, fellow of science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Victor argues that Kyoto cannot work, nor can unrealistic regulations on emissions reduction. </p> <p> Instead he argues for 'economic incentives that, over time, will slow the build-up of carbon dioxide without the imposition of binding targets for a far-off future'. This ideology is embodied by John Graham, whom Bush picked last weekend to head his Office of Management and Budget - which oversees all regulatory agencies - an appointment which thrilled lobbyists. Graham, regarded as the guru of cost benefit analysis, has a history of eco-scepticism. </p> <p>Last week's decision to kill Kyoto did not enjoy full backing of the administration - some quarters of which saw it as a fait accompli from the White House and the National Security Council. Successive opinion polls show that the environment is a major issue for voters, and Bush's enemies are lining up for a PR battle. Even Republican Representative Sherwood Boehlert believes Bush is 'taking a risk' by issuing 'so many controversial decisions so early'. Mark Mellman, a Democrat pollster, said: 'Bush is creating a political disaster for himself.'</p>",

Bush had promised to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide, but two weeks ago he reversed this, citing a report commissioned last year by Republican Senator David McIntosh, saying that carbon dioxide restrictions could 'boost electricity prices and hurt coal-fired utilities'. Shortly before the announcement, Washington was blitzed by the 'Coal Based Generators' group to lobby for a reversal on emissions and tax breaks for 'clean coal' utilities. Leading the group was Irl Engelhardt, chairman of Peabody, America's largest coal enterprise, who was also a major Republican contributor and energy adviser to the Bush-Cheney transition team. The same letter that disclosed the volte-face on carbon dioxide also announced the scrapping of new Clinton regulations reducing arsenic levels in drinking water by 80 per cent. The EPA's former administrator for water, Chuck Fox, who drafted the legislation, said: 'This action will jeopardise the health of millions of Americans.' And its backer in Congress, Henry Waxman, called the ruling 'another example of payback to industries that gave millions of dollars in campaign contributions'. Fear of continuing fuel price rises and shrinking supply then dictated the White House's reaction to the energy crisis in California - ironically caused, said the Democrats, by the very deregulation policies favoured by the administration on a national scale. Bush's language - and his catchphrase that 'national security depends on energy security' - turned the crisis into a national emergency which dovetailed into the arguments that tranches of federal land protected by Clinton - including the vast and virgin Arctic wilderness in Alaska - should be opened up for prospecting and drilling. These announcements - as well as Kyoto - have stirred even the most mainstream groups to exasperation, with the executive director of the Sierra Club - equivalent to the National Trust - predicting 'a very major fight'. Two entwined schools of thought form the core of the Bush administration: deregulation and decentralisation. The underpinning ideology is the injection of market forces into management of the public domain, and the belief that industry should police itself. Supporters of last week's decision include David Victor, fellow of science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Victor argues that Kyoto cannot work, nor can unrealistic regulations on emissions reduction. Instead he argues for 'economic incentives that, over time, will slow the build-up of carbon dioxide without the imposition of binding targets for a far-off future'. This ideology is embodied by John Graham, whom Bush picked last weekend to head his Office of Management and Budget - which oversees all regulatory agencies - an appointment which thrilled lobbyists. Graham, regarded as the guru of cost benefit analysis, has a history of eco-scepticism. Last week's decision to kill Kyoto did not enjoy full backing of the administration - some quarters of which saw it as a fait accompli from the White House and the National Security Council. Successive opinion polls show that the environment is a major issue for voters, and Bush's enemies are lining up for a PR battle. Even Republican Representative Sherwood Boehlert believes Bush is 'taking a risk' by issuing 'so many controversial decisions so early'. Mark Mellman, a Democrat pollster, said: 'Bush is creating a political disaster for himself.'",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair's cherished project to realign the centre left has fallen into a coma, according to the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, who has abandoned a joint cabinet committee until after the general election.</p> <p>Exasperated by the prime minister's failure to live up to his promises on electoral reform, Mr Kennedy has decided that there is little point in maintaining the Lib-Lab cabinet committee unless Labour shifts its stance on proportional representation. \"The project is gently residing in a coma where it is ready for people to revive it if they wish,\" a Kennedy aide said yesterday. \"We haven't held a meeting of the cabinet committee since the summer because we can't see the point of poncing up Downing Street if we aren't going to get something out of it.\"</p> <p>Mr Kennedy's reluctance to sit on the historic cabinet committee will come as a severe disappointment to the champions of Lib-Lab cooperation, which was forged in the run-up to the last election by Tony Blair and Sir Paddy Ashdown. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his Lib Dem counterpart Menzies Campbell, two of the original architects of the project, yesterday underlined their determination to press ahead with strengthening the links.</p> <p>In an article in the Times to promote a forthcoming book on the centre left, Mr Cook and Mr Campbell said they hoped their \"unique exercise in political cooperation\" would help to create a new style of politics in Britain.</p> <p>\"Our existing political culture is not conducive to consensus building,\" they wrote. \"The adversarial approach to debate promotes polarisation of opinion. Our cooperation should not be seen as an exercise in short term political management but as a continuing contribution towards a new style of politics.\" Although the article was approved by both the prime minister and the Lib Dem leader, its friendly language contrasted with the thinking of the Kennedy circle. The Kennedy aide insisted that there was no division between Mr Campbell and Mr Kennedy, but added: \"You can be a bit more statesmanlike in foreign affairs.\"</p> <p>Mr Kennedy will decide whether to shut down Lib-Lab cooperation altogether when Labour publishes its manifesto. If Labour commits itself to holding a referendum on electoral reform, he is likely to reopen talks. If there is no mention of a referendum, the project will be consigned to the history books.</p> <p>Lib Dems have been disappointed with Labour for failing to live up to its 1997 manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on electoral reform. An independent commission was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Jenkins of Hillhead after the election, but its proposal for a new system known as AV plus has been quietly shelved.</p> <p>It is understood that Mr Kennedy has still not given up hope of a referendum pledge in Labour's next maniesto. But there are reports that Labour may opt for an AV system of voting which falls well short of the Jenkins proposal. \"Let us wait to see the colour of their money,\" the Kennedy aide said.</p> <p>While the Lib Dems await Labour's manifesto, the party is scaling down its links with the government.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's cherished project to realign the centre left has fallen into a coma, according to the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, who has abandoned a joint cabinet committee until after the general election. Exasperated by the prime minister's failure to live up to his promises on electoral reform, Mr Kennedy has decided that there is little point in maintaining the Lib-Lab cabinet committee unless Labour shifts its stance on proportional representation. \"The project is gently residing in a coma where it is ready for people to revive it if they wish,\" a Kennedy aide said yesterday. \"We haven't held a meeting of the cabinet committee since the summer because we can't see the point of poncing up Downing Street if we aren't going to get something out of it.\" Mr Kennedy's reluctance to sit on the historic cabinet committee will come as a severe disappointment to the champions of Lib-Lab cooperation, which was forged in the run-up to the last election by Tony Blair and Sir Paddy Ashdown. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his Lib Dem counterpart Menzies Campbell, two of the original architects of the project, yesterday underlined their determination to press ahead with strengthening the links. In an article in the Times to promote a forthcoming book on the centre left, Mr Cook and Mr Campbell said they hoped their \"unique exercise in political cooperation\" would help to create a new style of politics in Britain. \"Our existing political culture is not conducive to consensus building,\" they wrote. \"The adversarial approach to debate promotes polarisation of opinion. Our cooperation should not be seen as an exercise in short term political management but as a continuing contribution towards a new style of politics.\" Although the article was approved by both the prime minister and the Lib Dem leader, its friendly language contrasted with the thinking of the Kennedy circle. The Kennedy aide insisted that there was no division between Mr Campbell and Mr Kennedy, but added: \"You can be a bit more statesmanlike in foreign affairs.\" Mr Kennedy will decide whether to shut down Lib-Lab cooperation altogether when Labour publishes its manifesto. If Labour commits itself to holding a referendum on electoral reform, he is likely to reopen talks. If there is no mention of a referendum, the project will be consigned to the history books. Lib Dems have been disappointed with Labour for failing to live up to its 1997 manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on electoral reform. An independent commission was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Jenkins of Hillhead after the election, but its proposal for a new system known as AV plus has been quietly shelved. It is understood that Mr Kennedy has still not given up hope of a referendum pledge in Labour's next maniesto. But there are reports that Labour may opt for an AV system of voting which falls well short of the Jenkins proposal. \"Let us wait to see the colour of their money,\" the Kennedy aide said. While the Lib Dems await Labour's manifesto, the party is scaling down its links with the government. There has been no meeting since July of the joint cabinet committee which has been mothballed until after the election. Talks between individual frontbench spokesman are continuing, but these are being wound down. Likening the state of the project to a coma is the most dramatic illustration of the Lib Dem leader's wariness over co-operation with Labour. Although Mr Kennedy has long been sceptical of the links, he has been careful to use diplomatic language since his election as party leader in 1999 to keep faith with allies of Sir Paddy. While the parties drift apart at a national level, there is continuing speculation that they may agree informal election pacts at a grassroots level to encourage anti-Tory tactical voting at the general election. This is strenuously denied by both parties. However, the Lib Dems have failed to select candidates in some key Labour/Tory marginal seats.",

      "body": "<p>Any hopes within the Microsoft Corporation that the new year might prove less legally embroiled than the old one were rudely shattered yesterday when lawyers in Washington DC filed a $5bn class action racial discrimination claim against the huge American software company. </p> <p>The suit, which is the fourth major anti-discrimination legal challenge to Microsoft in the past three months, alleges that seven past and present Microsoft employees suffered racial bias in company evaluations, compensation, promotions and retaliation. </p> <p>The new cases come on top of the historic competition case against the company last year in which Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had exercised monopolistic powers to control the market in operating systems and internet browsers; he ordered that the company should be split into two. </p> <p>Microsoft has also faced persistent legal complaints from temporary workers about lack of full-time rights. </p> <p>But the latest suit appears to be much the most serious challenge that the embattled corporation has faced on the race discrimination front. Only 2.6% of Microsoft's 21,429 workforce are black, according to 1999 company figures, and black staff make up only 1.6% of the company's managers. Black Americans make up approximately 13% of the US population as a whole. </p> <p>\"Microsoft has discriminated against African-American employees who made valuable contributions to the company but were not treated with the same dignity, respect and compensation as their white counterparts,\" alleged the plaintiffs' lawyer, Willie Gary, at a press conference in Washington yesterday. </p> <p>\"There are glass ceilings and glass walls in place for African Americans at Microsoft. </p> <p>\"We are stunned and disappointed in their treatment of black employees.\" </p> <p>The man at the centre of the new case is Rahn Johnson, a former account executive at Microsoft who worked for the company for four and a half years selling its products to the US Army. </p> <p>Mr Jackson stopped working for Microsoft in October 2000. He alleges that he was repeatdely passed over for promotions despite 17 years of sales experience, and that he contacted several company executives - including the corporation's president, Steve Ballmer, with his complaints. \"I was absolutely ignored,\" Mr Jackson said yesterday. </p> <p>Microsoft spokesman Dean Katz said the company was wholly committed to ethnic diversity. \"Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination in any of its employment practices, and we are committed to treating all of our employees fairly,\" Mr Katz said. </p> <p>But a former Microsoft information technology director, Peter Browne - who at one time was the highest ranking black American in the company workforce - challenged the company position yesterday, saying he was often approached by fellow black workers who were worred about their treatment. </p> <p>\"I found soon enough I couldn't help them. I couldn't help myself,\" Mr Browne said. </p> <p>Mr Browne, who is 58, has his own race and age discrimination claim against Microsoft scheduled for trial hearing later this year. </p> <p>Mr Gary comes to the new case against Microsoft with a formidable and high profile record - which includes a successful $720m anti-discrimination damages suit last year against Disney World. </p> <p>He is also acting- along with OJ Simpson's lawyer Johnnie Cochran - in a continuing $1.5bn suit against US drinks group Coca-Cola.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Any hopes within the Microsoft Corporation that the new year might prove less legally embroiled than the old one were rudely shattered yesterday when lawyers in Washington DC filed a $5bn class action racial discrimination claim against the huge American software company. The suit, which is the fourth major anti-discrimination legal challenge to Microsoft in the past three months, alleges that seven past and present Microsoft employees suffered racial bias in company evaluations, compensation, promotions and retaliation. The new cases come on top of the historic competition case against the company last year in which Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft had exercised monopolistic powers to control the market in operating systems and internet browsers; he ordered that the company should be split into two. Microsoft has also faced persistent legal complaints from temporary workers about lack of full-time rights. But the latest suit appears to be much the most serious challenge that the embattled corporation has faced on the race discrimination front. Only 2.6% of Microsoft's 21,429 workforce are black, according to 1999 company figures, and black staff make up only 1.6% of the company's managers. Black Americans make up approximately 13% of the US population as a whole. \"Microsoft has discriminated against African-American employees who made valuable contributions to the company but were not treated with the same dignity, respect and compensation as their white counterparts,\" alleged the plaintiffs' lawyer, Willie Gary, at a press conference in Washington yesterday. \"There are glass ceilings and glass walls in place for African Americans at Microsoft. \"We are stunned and disappointed in their treatment of black employees.\" The man at the centre of the new case is Rahn Johnson, a former account executive at Microsoft who worked for the company for four and a half years selling its products to the US Army. Mr Jackson stopped working for Microsoft in October 2000. He alleges that he was repeatdely passed over for promotions despite 17 years of sales experience, and that he contacted several company executives - including the corporation's president, Steve Ballmer, with his complaints. \"I was absolutely ignored,\" Mr Jackson said yesterday. Microsoft spokesman Dean Katz said the company was wholly committed to ethnic diversity. \"Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination in any of its employment practices, and we are committed to treating all of our employees fairly,\" Mr Katz said. But a former Microsoft information technology director, Peter Browne - who at one time was the highest ranking black American in the company workforce - challenged the company position yesterday, saying he was often approached by fellow black workers who were worred about their treatment. \"I found soon enough I couldn't help them. I couldn't help myself,\" Mr Browne said. Mr Browne, who is 58, has his own race and age discrimination claim against Microsoft scheduled for trial hearing later this year. Mr Gary comes to the new case against Microsoft with a formidable and high profile record - which includes a successful $720m anti-discrimination damages suit last year against Disney World. He is also acting- along with OJ Simpson's lawyer Johnnie Cochran - in a continuing $1.5bn suit against US drinks group Coca-Cola.",

A breakaway group of some of the most influential investment firms is understood to have presented proposals for tougher pay guidelines to the Association of British Insurers, whose members control as much as 25% of the stockmarket. Members of the rebel group were reluctant to be identified yesterday but are understood to be led by Baillie Gifford, the Scottish fund manager, which was unavailable for comment last night. One of the group's main concerns is thought to be the way directors receive incentives, usually in the form of stock options, particularly in the light of falling markets which have left many such awards \"under water\". The investors are said to be aware of the pressure they are under to exercise control over directors' pay and want to clarify the procedures for criticising what they consider excessive reward schemes. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, had promised a tough approach on directors' pay but indicated later that increased activism by investors, particularly over pay deals at Vodafone, had allowed the government to back off from its plans. The rebels are understood to want to present their proposals not only to the ABI, but also the National Association of Pension Funds. Peter Montagnon, head of investment affairs at the ABI, said he was aware of the breakaway group. \"We do talk to these institutions and their concerns are an indication among institutional investors that there are strong feelings on pay issues which companies would have to take into account,\" he said. \"We don't see this being in conflict with our own work but they are only one group and are not representative of the industry as a whole.\" The move comes as the ABI and NAPF are reviewing their rules on directors' pay.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The ballerina Tanaquil Le Clercq, who has died of pneumonia aged 71, was George Balanchine's muse at a crucial period in the development of American classic ballet. Her career lasted only from 1945 - when she first danced in works by Balanchine as a student at the School of American Ballet in New York - until it was tragically cut short when she contracted polio during the 1956 European tour of New York City Ballet.</p> <p>By that time she had been married to Balanchine for four years. As with his previous wives (Tamara Geva, Vera Zorina and Maria Tallchief) and other ballerinas who served as his muse, the relationship was at least as much artistic as emotional, although he remained with Le Clercq in Copenhagen after she was first taken ill and did not choreograph for a year.</p> <p>Tanaquil Le Clercq was born in Paris and moved to New York with her parents (her father was French, her mother American) at the age of three. As a child she studied with Mikhail Mordkin, then in 1941 she won a scholarship to the School of American Ballet, Balanchine's school.</p> <p>Almost at once he singled her out as a potential ballerina, and in 1945 cast her in two ballets made for a student performance, the classical Symphonie Concertante and, more significantly, a duet for two women to Igor Stravinsky's Elegie, which looked forward to the more experimental style of which Le Clercq was to become a leading exponent.</p> <p>In the following year he choreographed another short ballet, Resurgence, performed only once at a benefit for the March of Dimes, a charity devoted to ending the spread of polio. In this number, Le Clercq appeared as a young dancer menaced by the Threat of Polio, played by Balanchine himself, an irony that was not lost on him when Le Clercq actually succumbed to the disease 10 years later.</p> <p>In that decade, he created many roles for her in which she epitomised the American classic style that he had envisioned when he first went to the US at Lincoln Kirstein's invitation in 1933 to found a school and an associated company. Le Clercq was his ideal ballerina, the exemplar of what came to be known as the Balanchine type - sleek, long-limbed, instinctively musical. Moreover, as early as 1946, in the first season of Ballet Society, precursor of New York City Ballet, she brought a personal dramatic intensity to the Choleric variation in the Four Temperaments. In a purely classical vein, she spun out the long seamless line of the slow movement of Bizet's Symphony in C.</p> <p>For those who followed New York City Ballet in those early years at the City Center Theater - or for that matter in its first London season at Covent Garden in 1950 - there are many unforgettable images from Le Clercq's performances: her seemingly continuous spinning as she swooned in her partner's arms in the last movement of Serenade; the obscene strut of her exit after she and her band of Bacchantes had torn Orpheus to pieces; her hilarious duet with Jerome Robbins in Bourr\u00e9e Fantasque (and Le Clercq was as witty offstage as on); and one of the legendary moments of 20th century ballet in La Valse, when, as the great critic Edwin Denby wrote, she \"[threw] her head back as she plunge[d] her hand into the black glove\" offered by the figure of Death. In every role her performance was informed by what Denby called \"her New York elegance of person, her intelligence in every movement, the delicacy of her rhythmic attack\".</p> <p>Le Clercq worked as no tably with other choreographers: she danced in Merce Cunningham's The Seasons, also for Ballet Society, in 1947 (and danced in his concerts in Paris in 1949 and New York in 1950); she personified Sacred Love in the \"Being Beauteous\" section of Frederick Ashton's Illuminations for New York City Ballet in 1950; later, when Antony Tudor briefly joined the company, she appeared as the Episode from his past in a revival of his Lilac Garden. And her association with Jerome Robbins was hardly less important than that with Balanchine, most memorably in Afternoon Of A Faun, originally danced with Francisco Moncion, as the ballet student absorbed by her own reflection, and in The Concert, as the soulful music lover, in which she had a solo that Robbins cut from the ballet after she no longer danced it.</p> <p>Although Le Clercq remained partially paralysed for the rest of her life, she continued to be involved with dancing.

      "bodyText": "The ballerina Tanaquil Le Clercq, who has died of pneumonia aged 71, was George Balanchine's muse at a crucial period in the development of American classic ballet. Her career lasted only from 1945 - when she first danced in works by Balanchine as a student at the School of American Ballet in New York - until it was tragically cut short when she contracted polio during the 1956 European tour of New York City Ballet. By that time she had been married to Balanchine for four years. As with his previous wives (Tamara Geva, Vera Zorina and Maria Tallchief) and other ballerinas who served as his muse, the relationship was at least as much artistic as emotional, although he remained with Le Clercq in Copenhagen after she was first taken ill and did not choreograph for a year. Tanaquil Le Clercq was born in Paris and moved to New York with her parents (her father was French, her mother American) at the age of three. As a child she studied with Mikhail Mordkin, then in 1941 she won a scholarship to the School of American Ballet, Balanchine's school. Almost at once he singled her out as a potential ballerina, and in 1945 cast her in two ballets made for a student performance, the classical Symphonie Concertante and, more significantly, a duet for two women to Igor Stravinsky's Elegie, which looked forward to the more experimental style of which Le Clercq was to become a leading exponent. In the following year he choreographed another short ballet, Resurgence, performed only once at a benefit for the March of Dimes, a charity devoted to ending the spread of polio. In this number, Le Clercq appeared as a young dancer menaced by the Threat of Polio, played by Balanchine himself, an irony that was not lost on him when Le Clercq actually succumbed to the disease 10 years later. In that decade, he created many roles for her in which she epitomised the American classic style that he had envisioned when he first went to the US at Lincoln Kirstein's invitation in 1933 to found a school and an associated company. Le Clercq was his ideal ballerina, the exemplar of what came to be known as the Balanchine type - sleek, long-limbed, instinctively musical. Moreover, as early as 1946, in the first season of Ballet Society, precursor of New York City Ballet, she brought a personal dramatic intensity to the Choleric variation in the Four Temperaments. In a purely classical vein, she spun out the long seamless line of the slow movement of Bizet's Symphony in C. For those who followed New York City Ballet in those early years at the City Center Theater - or for that matter in its first London season at Covent Garden in 1950 - there are many unforgettable images from Le Clercq's performances: her seemingly continuous spinning as she swooned in her partner's arms in the last movement of Serenade; the obscene strut of her exit after she and her band of Bacchantes had torn Orpheus to pieces; her hilarious duet with Jerome Robbins in Bourr\u00e9e Fantasque (and Le Clercq was as witty offstage as on); and one of the legendary moments of 20th century ballet in La Valse, when, as the great critic Edwin Denby wrote, she \"[threw] her head back as she plunge[d] her hand into the black glove\" offered by the figure of Death. In every role her performance was informed by what Denby called \"her New York elegance of person, her intelligence in every movement, the delicacy of her rhythmic attack\". Le Clercq worked as no tably with other choreographers: she danced in Merce Cunningham's The Seasons, also for Ballet Society, in 1947 (and danced in his concerts in Paris in 1949 and New York in 1950); she personified Sacred Love in the \"Being Beauteous\" section of Frederick Ashton's Illuminations for New York City Ballet in 1950; later, when Antony Tudor briefly joined the company, she appeared as the Episode from his past in a revival of his Lilac Garden. And her association with Jerome Robbins was hardly less important than that with Balanchine, most memorably in Afternoon Of A Faun, originally danced with Francisco Moncion, as the ballet student absorbed by her own reflection, and in The Concert, as the soulful music lover, in which she had a solo that Robbins cut from the ballet after she no longer danced it. Although Le Clercq remained partially paralysed for the rest of her life, she continued to be involved with dancing. For a while she was head of the faculty of the Dance Theater of Harlem's school, and she frequently attended performances of New York City Ballet, which honoured her as a founding member of the company on the opening night of its 50th anniversary season in 1998. Her marriage to George Balanchine ended in divorce in 1969. Patricia Lousada writes : Tanaquil Le Clercq was as remarkable a person as she was a dancer. Her career may have only lasted 10 years, but she became a ballerina of great wit and elegance, and a lasting icon for the New York City Ballet. Her long legs and delicate but strong technique, and her style, which had a subtlety more European than American, were unique.

The four, charged with conspiring with Mr Bin Laden to bomb the embassies, were led into the federal court in Manhattan wearing white Islamic clothing. The location is resonant with meaning: it is the court in which six men were found guilty of bombing the World Trade Centre in 1993. Concrete and metal barriers were in place outside the courthouse, but with only six cameras present the media circus was more of a sideshow. Families of victims of the bombs in Nairobi, Kenya, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in August 1998 were there to take the gloss off the attempt inside to unfold an image of a global international terror plot. Edith Bartley, whose father and brother died in the Nairobi attack, said: \"They [the US government] were playing Russian roulette with Americans lives and they continuing to do so. \"The government was negligent.

The trial is expected to take at least nine months. Jury selection alone, from a pool of 1,500 people, is likely to stretch beyond three weeks, during which the public and press are excluded. One man has already pleaded guilty to conspiring with Osama bin Laden and is expected to be the star witness for the prosecution, acting as a window on the world of the west's most reliable bogeyman. Ali Mohamed's evidence linking Mr bin Laden to the bombings is the bridge on which the prosecution hopes to extend the trial into an examination of an organisation accused of killing westerners all over the world. \"We will pursue this goal for however long it takes and wherever in the world the evidence leads us,\" said Barry Mawn, assistant director of the FBI's New York office. Ali Mohamed, 48, a former US army sergeant who has not been sentenced yet, told an earlier hearing that Mr bin Laden asked him seven years ago to carry out surveillance on British, American, French and Israeli targets in Nairobi. \"I took pictures, drew diagrams and wrote a report,\" he said. Mr Mohamed's plea-bargain terms have not yet been made public. \"Bin Laden looked at the picture of the American embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber. The objective of all this was just to attack any western target in the Middle East, to force the governments of western countries just to pull out of the Middle East, not to interfere.\" In all, 22 people have been charged with the bombing: the four who went on trial yesterday, who have all denied the charges; another who will face the New York court later; three awaiting extradition from Britain; and 13, including Osama bin Laden, who remain at large. Two of those on trial are liable to the death penalty if they are found guilty. They Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, 23, a Saudi national accused of being a would-be suicide bomber in the Nairobi explosion; and Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 27, an Tanzanian, who is charged with helping to carry out the attack in Dar es Salaam. Wadih el Hage, 40, a Lebanese-born US citizen, is charged with serving as a leading aide to Mr bin Laden.

      "body": "<p>Dear Minister Hain,</p> <p>17 December 2000 was the first anniversary of UN Resolution 1284. This resolution was offered by the UN security council last year as a step forward in resolving outstanding disarmament, and arms monitoring issues as a precondition for the suspension of comprehensive economic sanctions against Iraq.</p> <p>As many feared, including myself, this resolution was a still-born creation. For this neither the British nor the Iraqi governments but rather the people of Iraq continue to pay dearly and daily. The European public is increasingly unwilling to accept such a policy. There is deep concern because of the suffering of innocent civilians and the irrefutable evidence of violations of international law by the UN security council.</p> <p>Without a transparent political agenda and a determined end to contaminating information, I do not see an end to this costly human tragedy in Iraq. Your speech of 7 November at Chatham House has not helped in this regard. Let me single out nine specific points of what you have said:</p> <p>\u0095 \"Our air crews risk their lives patrolling the skies above southern Iraq.\" <br><br>The public does not know that you do this without a mandate by the UN security council. It is in your hands to stop endangering your pilots by withdrawing them from Iraqi skies. It angered your office that I introduced air-strike reporting for 1999 while serving in Iraq. I did so as the UN secretary general's designated official for security because of the dangers for the security of a highly mobile team of UN observers travelling daily on the roads of Iraq. The report showed that out of 132 incidents, UN staff was witness to such air strikes on 28 occasions.</p> <p>The public does not know that in the very areas you established as 'no-fly zones' to protect (7) the population living there, 144 civilians died and 446 were wounded by UK/US airforces. The FCO classified these reports as Iraqi propaganda with a UN imprimatur\" even though much of it was collected and verified by UN staff travelling in the areas at the time of the strikes.</p> <p>\u0095 \"Our sailors are involved in activities to curb the illegal export of Iraqi oil.\" <br><br>This is known.

      "bodyText": "Dear Minister Hain, 17 December 2000 was the first anniversary of UN Resolution 1284. This resolution was offered by the UN security council last year as a step forward in resolving outstanding disarmament, and arms monitoring issues as a precondition for the suspension of comprehensive economic sanctions against Iraq. As many feared, including myself, this resolution was a still-born creation. For this neither the British nor the Iraqi governments but rather the people of Iraq continue to pay dearly and daily. The European public is increasingly unwilling to accept such a policy. There is deep concern because of the suffering of innocent civilians and the irrefutable evidence of violations of international law by the UN security council. Without a transparent political agenda and a determined end to contaminating information, I do not see an end to this costly human tragedy in Iraq. Your speech of 7 November at Chatham House has not helped in this regard. Let me single out nine specific points of what you have said: \u0095 \"Our air crews risk their lives patrolling the skies above southern Iraq.\" The public does not know that you do this without a mandate by the UN security council. It is in your hands to stop endangering your pilots by withdrawing them from Iraqi skies. It angered your office that I introduced air-strike reporting for 1999 while serving in Iraq. I did so as the UN secretary general's designated official for security because of the dangers for the security of a highly mobile team of UN observers travelling daily on the roads of Iraq. The report showed that out of 132 incidents, UN staff was witness to such air strikes on 28 occasions. The public does not know that in the very areas you established as 'no-fly zones' to protect (7) the population living there, 144 civilians died and 446 were wounded by UK/US airforces. The FCO classified these reports as Iraqi propaganda with a UN imprimatur\" even though much of it was collected and verified by UN staff travelling in the areas at the time of the strikes. \u0095 \"Our sailors are involved in activities to curb the illegal export of Iraqi oil.\" This is known. You are silent, as you have been in all your statements, about the UK condoned export of illegal oil from Iraq into Turkey. Your silence is understandable albeit not acceptable if you want the full story to be known. US/UK concurrence to this illegal export of oil is in exchange for Turkish government agreement to the use of Incirlik airbase in south-eastern Anatolia for allied sorties into the northern no-fly zone of Iraq. \u0095 \"I firmly believe that he (President of Iraq) remains determined to develop his nuclear, chemical and biological weapons capacity.\" You offer no evidence. What I in turn 'firmly believe' is that you want to keep a picture of Iraq alive even though it no longer reflects the realities on the ground. This is not surprising.

The division between West Jerusalem, which is predominantly Jewish, and East Jerusalem, which is predominantly Palestinian, is stark. There is no wall between the two, but there is an invisible line running down the length of the Number One Highway, which cuts the city in two.</p> <p>Since the intifada began again last September, it has been increasingly rare for people from one community to visit the other side. Israeli taxi drivers will not take fares to the Arab side. Theoretically, the divide is already there.</p> <p>The problem is the Old City, which calls into four parts: the Jewish quarter, where 3,500 people live; the Armenian quarter, where there are 2,000; the Arab quarter, which has 25,000: and the Christian quarter, which has about 500. All are pushed together in the tightly-packed streets.</p> <p>The US proposal is that Israel should have the Jewish quarter, plus part of the Armenian quarter, to provide a corridor from West Jerusalem to the Jewish quarter and the all-important Wailing Wall. The Palestinians would get the Arab and Christian quarters and the remainder of the Armenian quarter.</p> <p>Dividing an area of less than one square kilometre thus will not work unless both sides are willing to live peacefully together.</p> <p>But peaceful coexistence is made even more difficult by the religious divide. The Muslims want all of their holy site, the Haram al-Sharif. The Jews also want it, for the Wailing Wall. Mr Clinton suggested that the Muslims should have the upper half of the site and the Jews the lower.</p> <p>Madhi Abul Hadhi, head of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, in Jerusalem, insists that sharing the site in this way will only create more problems.</p> <p>\"You have a bedroom and you are sleeping with your wife. You do not allow anyone to sleep under your bed, but there they are. And then they start complaining they can't sleep.\"</p> <p><b> Territorial divide</b><br></p> <p>Mr Clinton has proposed that Israel should cede 95% of the West Bank and all of the Gaza Strip. In return for taking some West Bank land containing Jewish settlers, Israel has offered the Palestinians more land in either Gaza or the Negev desert.</p> <p>The Palestinians say this is less generous than it sounds. First, the West Bank land ceded to them will be closer to 90%, because Jerusalem and the Dead Sea are included in the calculation. Second, the Israelis want to keep three big isolated Jewish settlements on the West Bank: the Ariel block near Nablus in the north, the Ma'ale Adumim corridor between Jerusalem and Jericho in the centre, and Etzion, near Hebron, in the south. These settlements, the Palestinians argue, make it hard for Palestine to be viable as an independent state.</p> <p>But the big problem is again Jerusalem. Under the US plan, Israel would keep many of its settlements east of the city, which would leave Arab East Jerusalem almost cut off from the West Bank. If the proposal went ahead, the Palestinians say, it would chop the Palestinian area immediately east of Jerusalem into 10 islands.</p> <p><b> Refugees</b><br></p> <p>The most awkward problem of all is that presented by the 3.7m Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza. Except in Jordan, no attempt has been made to assimilate them.</p> <p>The US proposal is that they should give up their claim to a right of return to Israel and accept a right of return only to the new state of Palestine. Israel would allow up to 100,000 refugees to return to the Jewish state, others would be resettled elsewhere with compensation. There would be further compensation for losses. Finally, land ceded by Israel in the Negev or Gaza could be used to resettle the bulk of the refugees. Although the US plan is not specific, the latter proposal is aimed mainly at Palestinians now in Lebanon.</p> <p>Potential compromises could result in Tel Aviv increasing the number of refugees allowed to return to Israel and a US-EU-Japanese reconstruction programme to create new cities in Gaza for refugees from Lebanon. Other refugees could be absorbed in the countries where they live at present.</p> <p>The Palestinian negotiators insist that the right of return to Israel has to remain, even if the people concerned are not planning to exercise it. The team's statement said: \"There is no historical precedent for a people abandoning their fundamental right to return to their homes, whether they were forced to leave or fled in fear.\" But the negotiators added: \"The Palestinians are prepared to think flexibly and creatively about the mechanisms for implementing the right of return.\"</p> <p><b> Israeli security</b><br></p> <p>Under the US plan, an international force will supervise the implementation of the final agreement and Israel will be given three years to withdraw from Palestinian territory. But Israel will be allowed to keep a force at specific locations in the Jordan Valley for another three years, and maintain three early warning stations for 10 years.</p> <p>The Palestinians want details of where these Israeli units will be positioned and the size of the force. The negotiating team said: \"Israel has yet to make a persuasive case regarding why it would require either a standing force in the Jordan Valley or emergency deployment rights, much less both. This is especially the case given that international forces will be present in these areas.\"</p> <p>A Palestinian close to developments spoke of the negotiations as \"an evolution of the maps\". He said that maps were crucial to understanding why the Palestinians had needed to see the details of Mr Clinton's proposals.</p> <p>He pulled out maps dating back to the British mandate in the early years of the last century, showing how at the end of each decade the Jews had spread further and further eastwards from the coast.

Wallenberg, credited with saving thousands of Jews from Nazi death camps, was last seen in 1945 being arrested by Soviet troops in Budapest. Moscow maintained for years that he died of a heart attack in 1947 in its Lubyanka jail. But last month the Russian authorities said he had been \"unjustifiably arrested by non-judicial bodies\" and died in jail, a victim of Stalin's purges. A Swedish-Russian investigation into Wallenberg's fate, which began in 1991 and will present its findings on January 12, will show evidence that Sweden turned down the chance to negotiate his return, the tabloid daily Svenska Dagbladet said yesterday.

Obviously none of us was a trained doctor but we tried our best. We applied mouth to mouth. At times she did not have a pulse.</p> <p>\"I was there within four minutes of it happening. It looked like she was trying to go down the mountain in an extremely dangerous area. They just should not have been there. It was ridiculous. The incident happened at the side of a building and some people looking down would have seen it.\"</p> <p>Cara was spotted by cable car staff in an exclusion zone on the north-western corner of Table Mountain, some 30-50 metres west from the point tourists are allowed to abseil from.</p> <p>Mr Harrison added: \"Her mother and father were with her and would have seen it. The mother was very distressed. They were in a restricted no-go area, a part of the mountain that is very dangerous. It is clearly marked.</p> <p>\"Our staff saw them there and warned them it was a no-go area.\"</p> <p>Mr Harrison said that Cara had suffered severe neck injuries after she was caught in the moving steel structure supporting the steel and rubber arms which guide the cable car into the top station.</p> <p>She also suffered head injuries and was taken by air ambulance to hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival.</p> <p>Captain Andre Traut, of the Cape Town police, said it was believed to be the first accident involving the cable car since it opened in 1929. \"If one abides by the rules and the warning signs an accident of this nature should not occur.\"</p> <p>In London the Foreign Office said it believed Cara and her family had been holidaying in Namibia and South Africa since December 17. Arrangements were being made to inform relatives in Britain and return the body home. A date for an inquest has yet to be organised.</p> <p>Abseiling off Table Mountain, which attracts nearly 500,000 visitors a year, has become very popular in recent years.</p> <p>Vaughn Maree, operations manager of Abseil Africa, an adventure sports firm unconnected with the incident, said: \"It is the exposure of it. You are stepping off 1,000 metres.</p> <p>\"From the top of Table Mountain you have an incredible view of the 12 Apostles mountain range and Camps Bay which is a very popular beach.\"</p> <p>The descent takes an average of two to five minutes and anyone aged from 12 years, as long as they weigh over 40kg, up to 90 years old is allowed to participate, Mr Maree said.</p> <p>He said the cable care area was \"clearly signed as dangerous and the people there are very strict about not going there.</p> <p>\"The cable cars are coming up there and they weigh a couple of tonnes. You would not want to be there.\"</p>",

Cara Weaver was with her parents, Robert and Gillian, and brother at the 3,500ft world-famous beauty spot when her head became ensnared in the cable car machinery, and her neck was broken. It is believed that the teenager, who went to school in Dorset, had gone into a restricted area after climbing out of the window of a cable car station. South African police believe Cara had wanted to abseil down the mountain. John Harrison, managing director of the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway Company, which operates the cable car, said he had held Cara in his arms for 40 minutes after the accident. He said: \"She had severe neck injuries. Obviously none of us was a trained doctor but we tried our best. We applied mouth to mouth. At times she did not have a pulse. \"I was there within four minutes of it happening. It looked like she was trying to go down the mountain in an extremely dangerous area. They just should not have been there. It was ridiculous. The incident happened at the side of a building and some people looking down would have seen it.\" Cara was spotted by cable car staff in an exclusion zone on the north-western corner of Table Mountain, some 30-50 metres west from the point tourists are allowed to abseil from. Mr Harrison added: \"Her mother and father were with her and would have seen it. The mother was very distressed. They were in a restricted no-go area, a part of the mountain that is very dangerous. It is clearly marked. \"Our staff saw them there and warned them it was a no-go area.\" Mr Harrison said that Cara had suffered severe neck injuries after she was caught in the moving steel structure supporting the steel and rubber arms which guide the cable car into the top station. She also suffered head injuries and was taken by air ambulance to hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. Captain Andre Traut, of the Cape Town police, said it was believed to be the first accident involving the cable car since it opened in 1929. \"If one abides by the rules and the warning signs an accident of this nature should not occur.\" In London the Foreign Office said it believed Cara and her family had been holidaying in Namibia and South Africa since December 17. Arrangements were being made to inform relatives in Britain and return the body home. A date for an inquest has yet to be organised. Abseiling off Table Mountain, which attracts nearly 500,000 visitors a year, has become very popular in recent years. Vaughn Maree, operations manager of Abseil Africa, an adventure sports firm unconnected with the incident, said: \"It is the exposure of it. You are stepping off 1,000 metres. \"From the top of Table Mountain you have an incredible view of the 12 Apostles mountain range and Camps Bay which is a very popular beach.\" The descent takes an average of two to five minutes and anyone aged from 12 years, as long as they weigh over 40kg, up to 90 years old is allowed to participate, Mr Maree said. He said the cable care area was \"clearly signed as dangerous and the people there are very strict about not going there. \"The cable cars are coming up there and they weigh a couple of tonnes. You would not want to be there.\"",

      "bodyText": "Seven years of patent protected research have led to a world first for British medical scientists, who have reproduced the body's \"bone factory\" cell in a university laboratory. Bio-material taken from human skeletal cells has successfully triggered the natural process of endochronal ossification (EO) which creates cartilage and new bone round fractures and damaged bones. Trials of injecting the new substance into hip and knee joints and dental repairs will start shortly at Sheffield University, after success in triggering bone-making in ordinary marrow cells. Potentially the technique has important implications for surgery on older people, whose natural cartilage replacement has slowed down, and in reversing the bone damage caused by osteoporosis in older bones. \"We believe we have discovered the gold standard in this field,\" said Bradley Stringer, a tissue specialist at Sheffield, which took out protective patents in 1994 when doctors decided to investigate copying the natural EO process. \"What we've created is the very stuff that nature produces herself to repair bones or make them grow.\" The product, provisionally named Skeletex, is the result of painstaking work to copy the rich mixture of proteins and chemicals which trigger bone growth and repair. The Sheffield formula exactly mirrors the collection of active ingredients and others which remain inert until they meet bone marrow cells, which they then trigger into helping the ossification. \"You could call it a chemical soup, or perhaps a chemical symphony,\" said Dr Stringer. \"The task has been to find all the orchestra's members and then to get them playing together.\" Trials will start at Sheffield's school of clinical dentistry on volunteers with dental implants or gum disease which has worn away the bone which helps hold teeth in place. Success will lead to commercial marketing. \"One of our problems in med icine today is a shortage in the bone bank for conventional grafts,\" said Dr Stringer. \"Skeletex also has the promise to be much more effective than grafts, especially those using bone material ... where sterilisation is essential and the result is not always as effective as the natural, bone growing process.\" Hip and knee joints are another potential market be cause of the bio-material's strength which promises to remove the \"joint wobble\" problem which tends to affect people when cement used to fix artificial joint pins wears loose. Commercial benefits will accrue to Sheffield through its tissue-engineering company CellFactors which has financed the research programme.",

Not since Margaret Thatcher launched the \"great car economy\" in the 1989 white paper, Roads for Prosperity, has there been such an ambitious road building programme, say Jon Shaw and William Walton. \"Faced with the highly sensitive needs of motorists and the political ramifications of curbing their freedom, the pledge of John Prescott to cut the number of car journeys in the first five years of Labour rule has been abandoned,\" Mr Walton said. \"There has in fact been a remorseless increase in traffic growth.\" Another factor had been the damage to Britain's car factories if people were discouraged from driving. \"It is fundamentally inconsistent for the government to encourage more and more cars to be built in Britain and try to save factories due to be closed, and then ask people to buy cars but leave them in the garage,\" he said. \"If people buy cars they want to use them more often.\" Instead of curbing the motorist the government was spending more on public transport but at the same time attempting to revive the policy the Tories had abandoned of predicting traffic growth and providing the roads. The Department of the Environment had said specifically in 1998 that this did not work, but the recent 10 year transport plan had outlined 41 new trunk road schemes, probable funding for another 31, and more than 100 motorway and major road widening schemes - more than the average the Tories maintained over their 18 years in office. Instead of imposing restrictions on the motorist as Mr Prescott claimed he would in 1997, the powers to do this had been devolved to local authorities. National government therefore escapes the blame for unpopular local road pricing and tax on workplace parking schemes. Other research shows that death and serious injury rates vary dramatically in different parts of the country. The government had set local authority targets of reducing road casualties by 40% but it was clear that this was not likely to produce the best results, said Steven Toole of the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety. Two adjoining councils, Redcar and Cleveland, and North Yorkshire, had the lowest and highest road casualty figures in the country: 36 per 100,000 population in Redcar and Cleveland and 165 in North Yorkshire - more than four times as much. Greater London had around the average of 96 deaths and serious injury per 100,000 population. The precise reasons for the differences had not been established. It was likely that the traffic differences between rural and urban areas was a factor. Through routes and motorways also would have an influence. Research showed that speed cameras and cameras to catch people jumping red lights had a significant effect on reducing casualties. In urban areas 20 mph speed limits were particularly effective. It was clear that some measures, such as better car design and national drink driving campaigns, were outside the control of local authorities but also cut the casualty rate. More research was needed to find out how such big discrepancies occurred to assist local authorities to meet government imposed targets.

      "bodyText": "RUC chief constable Sir Ronnie Flanagan was called as a witness yesterday in the government's legal bid to keep Belfast loyalist paramilitary leader Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair in prison. Peter Mandelson had Adair, 37, jailed in August after police intelligence reports blamed him for orchestrating the feud between his Shankill Road Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The Northern Ireland secretary was furious at last month's preliminary finding by the sentence review commission that Adair should be let out . He is challenging this at a private hearing, attended by the UFF leader, which continues today at Maghaberry prison, Co Antrim, where Adair is held. Both the government and Adair's allies predict victory but a sentence review commission spokesman cautioned against taking the preliminary finding as any indication of the final ruling. Whatever happened, the loser would almost certainly appeal, and the final decision would go to judicial review. Mr Mandelson is determined to keep Adair in jail, fearing his release could reignite the inter-loyalist battle which claimed the lives of seven Belfast men before a truce was declared less than three weeks ago. Many moderates voted for the Good Friday peace accord swayed by Tony Blair's pledge that paramilitary prisoners such as Adair who were freed early would be put back in jail if they reoffended. Adair was imprisoned for 16 years on terrorism charges but freed in September 1999 after serving five years and now claims to be an advocate for peace. \"If it wasn't for people like Johnny Adair we mightn't have made the progress we have in the past six years,\" said John White, one of Adair's friends and chairman of the UFF's political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party. \"The seven men killed in the feud died after Johnny was back in jail which just goes to show he had nothing whatsoever to do with it.\" However, the chief constable publicly warned Adair that his behaviour was under scrutiny after he made several appearances at Drumcree, Co Armagh, during the stand-off between loyalists and security forces when the the Orange march down the nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown was banned last July. On one occasion, Adair was captured on film, applauding masked members of the renegade Loyalist Volunteer Force, which fired a volley of shots in the air as a show of strength. Ulster Defence Association leader, Andy Tyrie, and Mr White were among those lined up to speak on Adair's behalf but Mr White said lawyers had decided their testimony was no longer necessary because the preliminary finding meant the onus was now on the government to prove its case. Much of yesterday's hearing was taken up with legal arguments about whether a member of Northern Ireland's new human rights commission could be present while police officers gave confidential information. Adair will not be present during these sessions.

She left a loving family as a healthy, happy little girl...

      "bodyText": "Police and social services were incompetent and negligent when they allowed an eight-year-old girl to return home to her death, a jury at the Old Bailey in London was told yesterday. The jury heard that three London boroughs knew of the plight of Anna Climbie, who died from hypothermia and neglect after allegedly being trussed up in a bath and made to eat like a dog - but they failed to act. \"Police and social services, those people exhibited a truly blinding degree of incompetence,\" said Nigel Rumfitt, QC, defending. The court was hearing the summing up in the case of Marie Therese Kouao, 44, and her former boyfriend Carl Manning, 28, who are accused of murdering Anna in February of last year. Kouao denies all charges whilst Manning has admitted manslaughter and child cruelty. Linda Stern, prosecuting, told the jury that a police officer and a social worker were responsible for Anna being returned to Manning's flat in Tottenham, north London, where she eventually died of neglect and hypothermia. A Home Office pathologist had described Anna's case as the worst case of child abuse he had encountered and the jury was reminded that the child had suffered months of neglect, was critically undernourished, had been bound up, and had been exposed to wet as well as cold resulting in progressive hypothermia. Mrs Stern told the jury that child protection officer Karen Jones had been \"incompetent in her handling of the case\" along with social worker Lisa Arthur-Worry, and both had been heavily criticised for their lack of care in the case. Michael Gledhill, defending Kouao, criticised London councils for refusing to help a woman and small child because they were deemed to be intentionally homeless after moving to London from France. The court was told Kouao brought Anna from the Ivory Coast to London via France for what the child believed was a better education and life. \"Anna left the sunshine of the Ivory Coast and went to France with Marie Therese Kouao. She left a loving family as a healthy, happy little girl... Just under a year later she was dead,\" said Mrs Stern, who added that Kouao was a cunning, manipulative liar. Mr Rumfitt described Manning as \"a bit of a nerd\". He went on: \"What transformed a harmless nerd like that into a man who causes Anna to die? We say that Marie Therese Koauo is a devious, dishonest, manipulative woman.\" The case continues.",

The debacle is reminiscent of the Pinochet case, which had to be expensively reheard by the House of Lords after it emerged that one of the original panel of law lords, Lord Hoffmann, had close links with Amnesty International, a party to the case. The medicines case was halted in November, six weeks into a trial in the restrictive practices court, after one of two lay members hearing the case with a high court judge disclosed that a month after the trial started she had applied for a job with one of two rival economic consultancies whose evidence on behalf of the two opposing sides will be crucial to the outcome. Penelope Rowlatt, an economist hearing the case with Mr Justice Lightman and an accountant, James Scott, sounded out Frontier Economics about a job. A Frontier director is an important witness for the OFT on the key issue in the case - the effect on small pharmacies of abolishing the exemption for over the counter (OTC) medicines from the ban on resale price maintenance. The OFT wants to lift a 30-year-old court ruling which allows suppliers of non-prescription medicines to set a minimum price for 2000 branded drugs, including such household names as Nurofen and Lemsip.

The US agency for toxic substances and disease registry had said that no human cancer of any type has ever been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium\". Nato sources said yesterday that the North Atlantic Council would discuss the issue at its regular meeting next week.",

      "body": "<p>In its preview of one of Christian Thielemann's concerts with the Philharmonia late last year, London listings magazine Time Out called the conductor \"frightening\". It was a heavily loaded word, denoting not just musical rigour but burning ambition and political danger. Norman Lebrecht evidently agrees with that perception: in his turn-of-the-year summing-up in the Daily Telegraph of conductors to watch, he called Thielemann \"bluntly ambitious\" and said that \"only his penchant for reported rightwing indiscretions can stem his vertical progress\". </p> <p>Despite his severe haircut, Thielemann doesn't seem too frightening when we meet in a room at the Savoy hotel, but he is quick to anger. It happens twice. First when a man in a suit struts round the room shouting into a mobile phone - Thielemann glares at him and expounds loudly on \"uneducated, uncivilised\" behaviour. And then when I refer to the remark - \"Now the Jewish mess is ended\" - that he is alleged to have made about suggestions that Daniel Barenboim would leave his post as artistic director of the Berlin Staatsoper because of budget cuts. </p> <p>\"Can't we leave that out?\" he says. \"I have never said anything. I have to repeat that all the time. I am really getting furious about this. My conscience is clear. I never said these things. Whoever accuses you has to produce the proof. I don't have to prove my innocence.\" </p> <p>He quickly calms down - he is too garrulous and touchy-feely to be truly frightening - but it is a tricky moment. He is tired of such accusations, which he puts down to a campaign of disinformation being waged against him, and says he is consulting lawyers over articles that attributed that anti-semitic remark to him. </p> <p>The wounds are fresh because for the past year he has been at the centre of a bitter struggle for power and money within Berlin. Thielemann is the outgoing music director of the Deutsche Oper - he resigned last year because he felt that he was not properly consulted over the appointment of the new intendant - and Barenboim runs the Staatsoper in the former east Berlin. Each house has been fighting budget cuts proposed by the city government, and even now the situation remains unresolved. </p> <p>On the one hand, Thielemann says he would be happy to escape from Berlin, because he is tired of the infighting and personal abuse. But the way he has temporised and left doors open since his resignation suggests a certain reluctance to let go. \"Berlin is my city, and I'm the first Berlin-born chief conductor the Deutsche Oper has ever had. I began in this house and my whole youth listening to opera was there. I have a strong connection with this house.\" </p> <p>He insists, contrary to some reports, that he has no masterplan to take over opera in Berlin by fusing the two houses under his control. \"Oh, come on - it is completely ridiculous,\" he says. \"For one thing, it would be too much work. In any case, I would always call for diversity.\" Instead, he says, he favours the continuation of the two houses, but under a joint financial administration and with more liaison over repertoire. He says it is absurd that at present on the same night the two houses can both be performing a Wagner opera - conceivably even the same work. </p> <p>If he does leave, the 41-year-old Thielemann will not be short of engagements in a musical world eager for new conducting stars. He made a triumphant debut with Die Meistersinger at the Bayreuth festival last year and will be a key figure there over the next decade (he will do Tristan und Isolde in 2002 and a new Ring Cycle in 2006). He guest-con ducts the Vienna Philharmonic and the Philharmonia, and is becoming a familiar figure at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and at Covent Garden. He had also been tipped to become music director of one of the major American orchestras - there are vacancies in New York, Boston and Philadelphia - but the remarks attributed to him may have damaged him in the US. One executive of a US orchestra told me that what he needs now is a guest conductorship with the Israel Philharmonic to counter the smear campaign. </p> <p>Thielemann was born in Berlin - his parents were able but frustrated amateur musicians - and he played piano, violin and viola before deciding to become a conductor. In his late teens he became assistant to the septuagenarian Herbert von Karajan, from whom he learned a great deal. \"He would conduct so small and get these big results. It seemed so easy when he did it. I suppose he had come to the point where he could conduct with his little finger. After 25 years with the Berlin Philharmonic, it was a unique relationship.\" </p> <p>The \"young von Karajan\" label has been attached to Thielemann, not least by politically inspired opponents of Barenboim, but it is one that he rejects. \"Conductors should never see themselves in that way. We should see ourselves as who we are. People want to label other people, and I have been labelled very much. It is true up to a certain point, because you have to know where your roots are, but only to a certain point. It is so easy to be labelled, and people then get very confused when you break the rules.\" </p> <p>When I ask him in what ways he breaks the rules, his answer is instructive. \"I am breaking the rules all the time, but in a different way from how people might think. Rule-breaking is no longer about misbehaving or creating scandals or producing hysterical interpretations. We have had everything [orchestrally], just as we have had everything on stage. Twenty years ago it was new to have naked people on stage; now people say, 'So what?' We've seen everything, so now we have to concentrate on other details. I don't think we can be shocked any more. You can make grand gestures but they have to be sincere.\" </p> <p>Thielemann has steeped himself in the central European romantic repertoire, and his interpretations of Wagner, Schumann, Brahms and Richard Strauss have won him plaudits. \"I am trying to open the repertoire slowly,\" he says. \"I had this wonderful position in Berlin and could conduct all these Wagner and Strauss pieces that I am fascinated by. I have already done 45 performances of Tristan - who has done that at my age? - and 50 Meistersingers. </p> <p>\"I have probably already done Brahms' First Symphony 50 times. It has finished in my head, but if I have an important debut - with the Vienna Philharmonic or the Berlin Philharmonic, or in New York or London - I will choose pieces in which I am 100% secure. A lot of great conductors with long experience have done these pieces with these orchestras, and the musicians know after five minutes whether you have anything to add.\" </p> <p>Working with von Karajan was a key part of his musical education, but hearing recordings by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler appears to have been equally important. \"Furtw\u00e4ngler exemplifies the combination of freedom and framework, flexibility and architecture, hysteria and control,\" says Thielemann. \"It seems to be so spontaneous, but it is still in a picture and doesn't go everywhere. His feeling for the whole work is unrivalled. His Beethoven Nine in 1942 with the Berlin Philharmonic cannot be bettered. Either you have to give up conducting or you have to acknowledge that someone has done it in a near-perfect way.\" </p> <p>Thielemann is conscious of the legacy of Furtw\u00e4ngler and von Karajan. \"I was raised in this ambience. I heard these wonderful concerts; people gave Furtw\u00e4ngler recordings to me and I felt at home with them, just as every Italian growing up with Italian opera feels at home with it. But you have to build the tradition anew, not just carry it on.\" </p> <p>His critics have used his preoccupation with the German repertoire against him, but he considers that ridiculous. \"If you had a Russian conductor and he conducted Russian works, you wouldn't say a word. Why do people say a word when a German conductor conducts German works?\" </p> <p>Whether or not Thielemann is a political conservative, he is certainly a cultural conservative. He is anxious to separate art from politics, dislikes political correctness, and makes a point of saying that the objectives of les ev\u00e9n\u00e9ments of 1968 have been perverted, that the openness and flexibility of the protesters have hardened into dogma. He also refuses to make a blanket apology for Germany's history. \"I try to value things,\" he says. \"Never has everything been wrong. There are some very dark points; there are some very good points.\" </p> <p> Above all, he says that politics has no place in music. He has been criticised for resurrecting Hans Pfitzner's Palestrina, which he will conduct at Covent Garden later this month, by those who argue that Pfitzner's nationalist sympathies and anti-semitic statements put him beyond the pale. But Thielemann argues that if music is good, the moral character or political affiliation of the composer is irrelevant. </p> <p>\"When I first conducted Palestrina in Nuremberg, someone said, 'This is a nationalistic piece of shit.' This score, this beautiful, beautiful piece. What has C sharp minor to do with fascism? Nothing. Does Meistersinger have anything to do with politics? Can a tonality be political?\" </p> <p>I raise the nationalistic peroration at the end of Meistersinger, but Thielemann leaps on me. \"Ah come on - read the score properly. It has been used, I agree, but it doesn't mean that the work is forever out of circulation, and it is our duty to see it with fresh eyes.\" </p> <p>He is now warming to his argument. \"If people say that because you have a certain choice of repertoire, this must be connected with your political view, this is a sick thing. I choose the scores because I like them, and I conduct Hans Werner Henze in the same way as I do Pfitzner and Beethoven. I have done many contemporary pieces. I am not interested in what composers have eaten or what their political beliefs were. Music doesn't get better because one person was better than another person.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Palestrina is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), from January 29 to February 8.</p>",

Like Asma Akhras, the 25-year-old London-born computer science graduate who has married president Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Martina, too, has experienced the physical and emotional upheaval of transplanting life from one culture to another.</p> <p>Akhras, from the Sunni Muslim tradition, left her job as an economist with City bank JP Morgan and her family home in Acton, west London, to wed Syria's 35-year-old leader. The private New Year's Day ceremony was announced earlier this week.</p> <p>For Martina, the move to a Muslim country was not only cultural but also religious. Gone are the miniskirts, shorts, tank tops and funky arrangements of her long, blonde hair. In their place are sleeves that go down to the wrist, ankle-length skirts or trousers and a \"jilbab\", the Indonesian word for a long scarf pinned under the chin that reveals only the face and is usually worn whenever the wearer goes outside her home or receives guests.</p> <p>Martina wakes at 4.30 every morning to say the first of her five daily prayers, and has made the pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest Islamic site on earth. \"I have no regrets about what I have done,\" she says. \"Sure, it's a long way from where I was at 19 but you can't stay the way you were for ever. I was bound to change and this is how I have chosen to do it.\"</p> <p>Choice is the key word here and is at the heart of Martina's metamorphosis from hip Sydneyside teenager to modern Islamic woman. \"No one should be telling you to do anything,\" she stresses. At every step of the way, Martina was making her own decisions - to the extent that it was she who brought her husband Ariyanto back to the Islamic fold rather than him putting pressure on her to convert.</p> <p>\"He was not really that religious but he said he wanted an Islamic wedding,\" she said. \"His father asked me if I wanted to change my religion and I said I did not straight away but was willing to learn more about Islam. They were totally cool about that.\"</p> <p>Martina was not religious at the time. The evolution rather than revolution came after Ariyanto's father gave her a book about Islam. \"I was pregnant with our first child, so had time on my hands to read. I liked what I read. After a while, I decided Islam was a good religion and that I wanted to be a Muslim before Annisa [their first child] was born. I just had a feeling it would be right for me.\"</p> <p>Martina's ability to forge her own path was helped by the fact that Ariyanto was about as far as possible from the western stereotype of the Muslim fanatic. A spray-painter by trade, he met Martina at a club where he was playing bass guitar in the band. On their first date, he drank \"fluffy duck\" - a cocktail of lemonade and a sweet liqueur - and Martina drank rum and Coke. They both smoked.</p> <p>\"I often wonder what I would have done if he had said: 'You have to do this and that.' But if he had been Saudi [Arabian] and it had been love, then I might have gone along with it. After all, I agreed to move to Indonesia when I knew nothing much about the country.\"</p> <p>When Martina moved there, in August 1989, she found she had more problems with the culture than the religion. \"I came from a relatively small family, just a couple of sisters, whereas Ariyanto is one of nine. So at family gatherings, with all the nieces and nephews, uncles and aunts, there were well over 50 people. That was a bit overwhelming.\"</p> <p>On top of that was the language. \"When I moved, I didn't speak any Indonesian, so not only was I in these huge, unfamiliar gatherings, but I couldn't communicate well, either. That was also the case as I tried to find out more about Islam.\" When she could speak the language better, Martina found out that practices such as female circumcision, while not widespread, did take place. \"I did get upset and it was extremely tough at times.\"</p> <p>Homesickness followed - but only for Australia, not for a non-Islamic lifestyle. \"I sometimes wished I was back in Australia with my own friends. I disagreed and couldn't take some of the cultural aspects [of life in Indonesia], not the religion in itself.\"</p> <p>As Islam became a more prominent part of their lives, Ariyanto and Martina gave up drinking, smoking and clubbing, and settled down to a life of middle-aged respectability in which he is now president director of a booming Jakarta ad agency. But while Martina accepts he is head of the household, she fights for her rights with a tenacity likely to be absent from many British households, even though she is now on his turf.</p> <p>\"The Koran is very clear about the rights of women and we have so much going for us. It's just a case of being educated enough to know about them and defend them.\"</p> <p>The result is that she leads the life she wants to lead - she works as a language consultant in an Indonesian media company - and not as a housebound chattel. \"Take, for example, women's right to work. The Prophet [Muhammad]'s first wife had her own business. What could be a clearer sign that women have the right to an education and the right to work?\"</p> <p>The problems, she insists, are not with Islam but with the countries' cultures, which often existed long before Islam came along. One such example is arranged marriages. \"The couple have got to agree to marry. They cannot be forced on each other by their parents.\"</p> <p>Martina is fortunate that most Indonesians practise Sunni, the more moderate form of Islam, rather than Shiite which is prevalent in most of the Middle East. Despite this, she still hears horror stories of forced female circumcision, arrangedmarriages and women not allowed to work. Her advice to Asma Akhras is simple. \"Don't let yourself be forced into anything. Do everything at your own pace and stand up for your rights as a woman and a wife. It's a question of education and I still have to agree with something before I do it.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>David Elstein Former CEO of Channel 5 on the future of broadcasting</strong><br> So far, interactive TV isn't truly interactive - you only access things the programmers decide for you - but the future will bring addressable adverts. Instead of seeing a stream of general adverts, your set top box will receive a batch of ads, each targeted to individual consumers. Consumers will select the types of ads they do or don't want to see and be able to click through to more information if interested.</p> <p>A key player in 2001 is Sky. When exactly do they switch to the analogue signal? They've paused to take a breath now they have reached 5-6 million digital subscribers. But they have a half a million remaining analogue subscribers - do they abandon them? When the subsidising of free set-top boxes runs out there'll be even smaller incentives for viewers to convert to digital.</p> <p> Now the BBC and ITV have seen the colour of the governments white paper - it's more green than white - the next year will see them campaigning hard for concessions. We're not likely to see legislation until 2002-3. But does this mean we will see the regulatatory body Ofcom created ahead of the legislation? How long can they juggle these balls for? Fortunately the broadcasting industry is stable. But the for the regulators the situation is very uncertain.</p> <p><strong>Ian Pearson BT's Futureologist on mobile phones in 2001 </strong><br> A lot of companies are bringing out mobile devices in order to get their hands dirty before the full arrival of third generation [3G] phones in 2002. 3G is an \"always on\" technology, high bandwidth packet-based system which gives you similar functionality as WAP but you don't have to dial up and wait 30 seconds to connect to the internet. Companies will be bringing out devices with bigger screens. </p> <p>Clicking icons removes the need for people to be IT geeks and I think you'll see a raft of appliances that will bring high functionality at low cost with high ease of use.</p> <p>Phones could be used to \"locate\" a person. You could have a tracking provider that offers a service you could open to your friends. They could know where you are. If they had gone to the pub and wanted to know whether you were still in the country or had headed abroad for a weekend, they could access the database.</p> <p> Obviously companies wouldn't let people access your info without your permission, but it would be under your control. The industry comes down very strongly on the side of civil liberties.</p> <p>This year we'll see the disappearance of the boundaries between hand-held devices and mobiles. With 3G or GPRS, your phone is permanently connected to the 'net, if you link it to your palm pilot, your diary could be constantly updated by a secretary in the office. Different systems all become integrated together which gives people flexibility. Position-based services, provided they're authorised, are possible. Passing shops could let you know of the availability of products or offers you've requested. GPRS will allow positional accuracy of within a few metres, more than enough for shop services of this type. There's no limit to the range of services people can invent for this. For the customer it's just benefits, benefits, benefits.</p> <p> There will be enormous numbers of services coming out at ridiculously low prices to encourage people to use them. I think we'll see more and more adverts coming to phones, especially position-based adverts. There are simply loads of ways of recovering cash from the system, I think we'll even see many new ones being invented by people we haven't thought of during the year.</p> <p><strong>Chris Le Tocq Research Director-Desktop Software, User Productivity Gartner Research and Advisory Services on the future of computing in 2001 </strong><br> 2001 is looking like an important year for Microsoft. We've seen the arrival of a new President and Attorney General. Will the degree of pressure be kept on Microsoft in the anti-trust legal proceedings? There is some risk that anti-trust lawyers might be told to hold off. Elsewhere, Microsoft are launching Windows 2000 for consumers. A new version of Office will come out. They're launching their web-based Microsoft.net subscription service. Will people go for a service that means you rent programmes per year and not buy them outright? In the long run this won't be cost effective for people. Microsoft are planning to rent it at 50% of the cost of outright buying. I think it should be more like 25%. But Microsoft are trying to get past the problem that people don't update their software as much as Microsoft would like.</p> <p> The hand held devices market is evolving very quickly. There are two types of devices: data first/voice recognition second - in other words PDAs - and phone first/data second. The phone devices have a real leg in the market. But these two should converge. The key players like Palm, Casio and Handspring must find ways to add functionality to their PDAs. There are signs these companies have big plans on the drawing board.</p> <p>Finally, we'll see the emergence of centralised information systems. Large webstores that mean wherever you switch on your device you'll have access to your personalised information.</p> <p><strong>Gavin Robertson CEO of Music Indie, the commercial wing of the Association Of Independent Musicians [AIM] on the future of Digital Music </strong><br> I don't think there will be anything of the profile of Napster next year. New media is geared towards a consumption model - paying according to how you consume. The industry has been pushing ownership models, because that's what they understand through retail. The internet and new distribution mediums are pretty unsuitable to ownership models. What Napster did was point out the paradox of trying to force an ownership model onto a distribution medium that's ideally suited towards consumption pricing. To me, that's been truly pointed out. I don't think the industry will be caught off-guard to the same extent.</p> <p>You then have to work out what the value of music is to the consumer and how they're willing to pay for it, and in what way. Rather than assume the way they bought music is the way they're always going to buy it. I think subscription models are key. My only worry is that people won't research it properly and try and use models that don't work. There are very many ways of doing this. People get excited about music on phones but they don't really understand how they're going to use it. It sounds like a good idea - but does the customer really want it? There's a lot of work going into technology research but not enough going into market research as to what the technology is serving.</p> <p> Businesses get really excited about ideas but forget to ask the consumer if they really want them. It doesn't matter what business-to-business there is, there's a consumer in the end. </p> <p>The next year will see an identification of what people want to listen to and how to serve it to them. I think internet radio has huge potential but I'm still not convinced it's the best use of the bandwidth. The problem with internet radio is the more people listen to it, the more expensive it gets for the company. It's not like radio where you have a flat cost, no matter how many people listen. It means you have to develop a revenue model that's focused far more directly on your audience.</p> <p>But at what point does internet radio become customised jukebox? Radio is more than just music: it's actually communicating with some peer community, that is giving you information, music and everything that is part of your community. To have something geared just to your own dispassionate personal listening is not necessarily what radio is about.</p> <p>I believe, even for the next year, that the internet is an exceptionally good way to find out what CDs you want to buy. It's the biggest problem this industry has: people buy far too many CDs they don't like and then complain they're too expensive. MP3s are a different market. It's the punk of our generation but I certainly believe we don't need the knee jerk reactions that have been happening. If people say, 'I'm going to down load an MP3 and not buy a CD', it is a persuasive argument. But it's not seen any marketing to back it up.</p> <p>Someone on a think tank said to me 'anyone who stands up and says how much they're doing in the internet is as well imagining themselves, in years to come, standing up and proclaiming with great pride that their company uses electricity.' You have to be there with the internet and you should be embarrassed if you're not there - not proud if you are. That's a psychological shift that will go on next year as well. It becomes something you're not doing rather than something you are. As soon as it moves into the main consciousness, the whole relationship and the way the internet develops changes as well. We're at that edge now.</p> <p><strong>Eva Pascoe Joint managing director of Zoom.co.uk on e-commerce in 2001 </strong><br> One tricky area this year will be the integration of e-commerce into government, so you will be able to pay your parking tickets online. Do I get a lot of parking tickets? Oh man, don't even go there! </p> <p>I think the second area is the integration of telephone payments online and upping your credit limit for pay-as-you-go online. Perhaps all the networks were too busy flogging phones to be thinking about elegant customer service which is truly multi-channel. But I can sense it happening - with Chris Smith and Vodafone Interactive - Chris is a smart guy.</p> <p>The third one is utilities, I still can't pay most of my bills online. If you look at British Gas, London Electricity and a number of water people - perhaps Thames Water - they're all looking seriously at it. It'll be market channel payment systems - so you can pay by phone or online. In terms of ease of life, these three are pretty fundamental. We think about e-commerce in terms of the nice things in life. But if you think how much time you spend on hygiene - we could give the average consumer a day a month back - by saving them from queuing in various places. I think this is more important than the nice things online because the nice things will happen anyway.</p> <p>I expect a lot of people to go back to online advertising and emailing this year. With advertising going offline, a lot of agencies made a lot of money but it was completely pointless. If you look at your customers, offline, you're never looking at more than a quarter of them. It's a ridiculously expensive way of building and maintaining the brand. If your customers are online then talk to them online. Online ads will be popular as long as their impact is measurable.</p> <p><strong>Erol Ziya Spokesman for Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunication [CUTs] on telecommunications in 2001.</strong><br> The Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunications [CUTs] are looking for a stable dial-up market to emerge based on Flat Rate Internet Access Call Origination [FRIACO] and FRIACO-single tandem. That is a determination by Oftel which forces BT to sell access to the local loop at a flat rate. This allows ISPs to offer sustainable unmetered products. Unlike the first round of unmetered access, the industry is starting to develop retail products based on those wholesale products, the first being AOL's. </p> <p>Finally we will be able to get down to the business of sorting the good ISPs from the bad. Once you've got a level, wholesale environment where the right products can be offered I think -naturally - the good ISPs will float to the top and the bad ones will sink.</p> <p> The next year should be a much more healthy year for unmetered dial up access. That said, there is going to be great problems with 'local loop unbundling [LLU]' - allowing other operators into exchanges. The availability of broadband, that's the next battle front. There are no options at the moment; you can only buy BT's Ignite. Supposedly, LLU will solve this by allowing a whole range of people to put equipment in the exchanges. But that is going to be a much more tortuous and slower process than people imagine. I don't think you are going to see a proper range of broadband products within a year from now - maybe even longer. Again, BT is the key player in this and one of the key elements is whether they go ahead with this plan of spinning of the network from the retail services: the Netco idea. That could have a serious impact on the speed of roll out of broadband. There's unlikely to be Altavista-style problems because they should be solved by Friaco. People are a lot more cautious now. </p> <p> A lot of fingers got burnt by trying to deliver unmetered narrowband. I think this is going to be a very interesting area over the next year. Ultimately, it is inevitable that some break up of BT will happen, but the real question is to what degree it's done on BT's terms. Within the ISPs we see the move to focussing on getting some input. At the moment, BT is fairly confident that it can decide the terms on which it could spin off Netco. But again, I think there's a bigger picture there.

      "bodyText": "David Elstein Former CEO of Channel 5 on the future of broadcasting So far, interactive TV isn't truly interactive - you only access things the programmers decide for you - but the future will bring addressable adverts. Instead of seeing a stream of general adverts, your set top box will receive a batch of ads, each targeted to individual consumers. Consumers will select the types of ads they do or don't want to see and be able to click through to more information if interested. A key player in 2001 is Sky. When exactly do they switch to the analogue signal? They've paused to take a breath now they have reached 5-6 million digital subscribers. But they have a half a million remaining analogue subscribers - do they abandon them? When the subsidising of free set-top boxes runs out there'll be even smaller incentives for viewers to convert to digital. Now the BBC and ITV have seen the colour of the governments white paper - it's more green than white - the next year will see them campaigning hard for concessions. We're not likely to see legislation until 2002-3. But does this mean we will see the regulatatory body Ofcom created ahead of the legislation? How long can they juggle these balls for? Fortunately the broadcasting industry is stable. But the for the regulators the situation is very uncertain. Ian Pearson BT's Futureologist on mobile phones in 2001 A lot of companies are bringing out mobile devices in order to get their hands dirty before the full arrival of third generation [3G] phones in 2002. 3G is an \"always on\" technology, high bandwidth packet-based system which gives you similar functionality as WAP but you don't have to dial up and wait 30 seconds to connect to the internet. Companies will be bringing out devices with bigger screens. Clicking icons removes the need for people to be IT geeks and I think you'll see a raft of appliances that will bring high functionality at low cost with high ease of use. Phones could be used to \"locate\" a person. You could have a tracking provider that offers a service you could open to your friends. They could know where you are. If they had gone to the pub and wanted to know whether you were still in the country or had headed abroad for a weekend, they could access the database. Obviously companies wouldn't let people access your info without your permission, but it would be under your control. The industry comes down very strongly on the side of civil liberties. This year we'll see the disappearance of the boundaries between hand-held devices and mobiles. With 3G or GPRS, your phone is permanently connected to the 'net, if you link it to your palm pilot, your diary could be constantly updated by a secretary in the office. Different systems all become integrated together which gives people flexibility. Position-based services, provided they're authorised, are possible. Passing shops could let you know of the availability of products or offers you've requested. GPRS will allow positional accuracy of within a few metres, more than enough for shop services of this type. There's no limit to the range of services people can invent for this. For the customer it's just benefits, benefits, benefits. There will be enormous numbers of services coming out at ridiculously low prices to encourage people to use them. I think we'll see more and more adverts coming to phones, especially position-based adverts. There are simply loads of ways of recovering cash from the system, I think we'll even see many new ones being invented by people we haven't thought of during the year. Chris Le Tocq Research Director-Desktop Software, User Productivity Gartner Research and Advisory Services on the future of computing in 2001 2001 is looking like an important year for Microsoft. We've seen the arrival of a new President and Attorney General. Will the degree of pressure be kept on Microsoft in the anti-trust legal proceedings? There is some risk that anti-trust lawyers might be told to hold off. Elsewhere, Microsoft are launching Windows 2000 for consumers. A new version of Office will come out. They're launching their web-based Microsoft.net subscription service. Will people go for a service that means you rent programmes per year and not buy them outright? In the long run this won't be cost effective for people. Microsoft are planning to rent it at 50% of the cost of outright buying. I think it should be more like 25%. But Microsoft are trying to get past the problem that people don't update their software as much as Microsoft would like. The hand held devices market is evolving very quickly. There are two types of devices: data first/voice recognition second - in other words PDAs - and phone first/data second. The phone devices have a real leg in the market. But these two should converge. The key players like Palm, Casio and Handspring must find ways to add functionality to their PDAs. There are signs these companies have big plans on the drawing board. Finally, we'll see the emergence of centralised information systems. Large webstores that mean wherever you switch on your device you'll have access to your personalised information. Gavin Robertson CEO of Music Indie, the commercial wing of the Association Of Independent Musicians [AIM] on the future of Digital Music I don't think there will be anything of the profile of Napster next year. New media is geared towards a consumption model - paying according to how you consume. The industry has been pushing ownership models, because that's what they understand through retail. The internet and new distribution mediums are pretty unsuitable to ownership models. What Napster did was point out the paradox of trying to force an ownership model onto a distribution medium that's ideally suited towards consumption pricing. To me, that's been truly pointed out. I don't think the industry will be caught off-guard to the same extent. You then have to work out what the value of music is to the consumer and how they're willing to pay for it, and in what way. Rather than assume the way they bought music is the way they're always going to buy it. I think subscription models are key. My only worry is that people won't research it properly and try and use models that don't work. There are very many ways of doing this. People get excited about music on phones but they don't really understand how they're going to use it. It sounds like a good idea - but does the customer really want it? There's a lot of work going into technology research but not enough going into market research as to what the technology is serving. Businesses get really excited about ideas but forget to ask the consumer if they really want them. It doesn't matter what business-to-business there is, there's a consumer in the end. The next year will see an identification of what people want to listen to and how to serve it to them. I think internet radio has huge potential but I'm still not convinced it's the best use of the bandwidth. The problem with internet radio is the more people listen to it, the more expensive it gets for the company. It's not like radio where you have a flat cost, no matter how many people listen. It means you have to develop a revenue model that's focused far more directly on your audience. But at what point does internet radio become customised jukebox? Radio is more than just music: it's actually communicating with some peer community, that is giving you information, music and everything that is part of your community. To have something geared just to your own dispassionate personal listening is not necessarily what radio is about. I believe, even for the next year, that the internet is an exceptionally good way to find out what CDs you want to buy. It's the biggest problem this industry has: people buy far too many CDs they don't like and then complain they're too expensive. MP3s are a different market. It's the punk of our generation but I certainly believe we don't need the knee jerk reactions that have been happening. If people say, 'I'm going to down load an MP3 and not buy a CD', it is a persuasive argument. But it's not seen any marketing to back it up. Someone on a think tank said to me 'anyone who stands up and says how much they're doing in the internet is as well imagining themselves, in years to come, standing up and proclaiming with great pride that their company uses electricity.' You have to be there with the internet and you should be embarrassed if you're not there - not proud if you are. That's a psychological shift that will go on next year as well. It becomes something you're not doing rather than something you are. As soon as it moves into the main consciousness, the whole relationship and the way the internet develops changes as well. We're at that edge now. Eva Pascoe Joint managing director of Zoom.co.uk on e-commerce in 2001 One tricky area this year will be the integration of e-commerce into government, so you will be able to pay your parking tickets online. Do I get a lot of parking tickets? Oh man, don't even go there! I think the second area is the integration of telephone payments online and upping your credit limit for pay-as-you-go online. Perhaps all the networks were too busy flogging phones to be thinking about elegant customer service which is truly multi-channel. But I can sense it happening - with Chris Smith and Vodafone Interactive - Chris is a smart guy. The third one is utilities, I still can't pay most of my bills online. If you look at British Gas, London Electricity and a number of water people - perhaps Thames Water - they're all looking seriously at it. It'll be market channel payment systems - so you can pay by phone or online. In terms of ease of life, these three are pretty fundamental. We think about e-commerce in terms of the nice things in life. But if you think how much time you spend on hygiene - we could give the average consumer a day a month back - by saving them from queuing in various places. I think this is more important than the nice things online because the nice things will happen anyway. I expect a lot of people to go back to online advertising and emailing this year. With advertising going offline, a lot of agencies made a lot of money but it was completely pointless. If you look at your customers, offline, you're never looking at more than a quarter of them. It's a ridiculously expensive way of building and maintaining the brand. If your customers are online then talk to them online. Online ads will be popular as long as their impact is measurable. Erol Ziya Spokesman for Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunication [CUTs] on telecommunications in 2001. The Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunications [CUTs] are looking for a stable dial-up market to emerge based on Flat Rate Internet Access Call Origination [FRIACO] and FRIACO-single tandem. That is a determination by Oftel which forces BT to sell access to the local loop at a flat rate. This allows ISPs to offer sustainable unmetered products. Unlike the first round of unmetered access, the industry is starting to develop retail products based on those wholesale products, the first being AOL's. Finally we will be able to get down to the business of sorting the good ISPs from the bad. Once you've got a level, wholesale environment where the right products can be offered I think -naturally - the good ISPs will float to the top and the bad ones will sink. The next year should be a much more healthy year for unmetered dial up access. That said, there is going to be great problems with 'local loop unbundling [LLU]' - allowing other operators into exchanges. The availability of broadband, that's the next battle front. There are no options at the moment; you can only buy BT's Ignite. Supposedly, LLU will solve this by allowing a whole range of people to put equipment in the exchanges. But that is going to be a much more tortuous and slower process than people imagine. I don't think you are going to see a proper range of broadband products within a year from now - maybe even longer. Again, BT is the key player in this and one of the key elements is whether they go ahead with this plan of spinning of the network from the retail services: the Netco idea. That could have a serious impact on the speed of roll out of broadband. There's unlikely to be Altavista-style problems because they should be solved by Friaco. People are a lot more cautious now. A lot of fingers got burnt by trying to deliver unmetered narrowband. I think this is going to be a very interesting area over the next year. Ultimately, it is inevitable that some break up of BT will happen, but the real question is to what degree it's done on BT's terms. Within the ISPs we see the move to focussing on getting some input. At the moment, BT is fairly confident that it can decide the terms on which it could spin off Netco. But again, I think there's a bigger picture there. I think it goes beyond the specific needs of BT's requirements. We may see calls for government and regulatory interference in the process as to how BT splits off the various divisions.

Despite the rhetoric of open government, New Labour has consistently preferred secretive, backstairs deals, as the record of the party's national policy forum has shown.</p> <p>What is more worrying, however, is New Labour's cynical reliance on big money. The worst examples of this came in the New Year's honours list, where a knighthood went to Ronald Cohen for \"services to the venture capital industry\", (and presumably for giving \u00a3100,000 to the Labour party in 1997), while Ralph Hodge of Enron, the power company, gained a CBE for \"services to the power industries\" (and presumably for giving \u00a327,500 to New Labour).</p> <p>The dominance of New Labour by big money is a major reason that party membership has now dropped to less than two-thirds what it was at the last election. The cynicism now extends beyond the Labour party's ranks to the voting public as a whole. If millionaires buy into a political party, they are not doing so for disinterested motives. <br> <b>Trevor Fisher</b> <br> Stafford</p> <p>\u0095In January 1997 I, as a businessman, made a \u00a3100 donation to the Labour party to help it get elected. When in government it returned the \"favour\" by delivering on its promise to enact basic civilising measures such as a minimum income guarantee for workers, pensioners and the needy.</p> <p>What's the problem? The only difference between my donation and Paul Hamlyn's is its size - which illustrates what a grossly unequal society we still are. Good on Lord Hamlyn for doing something about it. <br> <b>Chris Trude</b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095I had a good chuckle today; Lord Hamlyn was made a CBE in 1993 by the Conservative government for charitable services. <br> <b> Neil Browning </b><br> Surbiton</p> <p>\u0095I reckon that if Paul Hamlyn and the rest of his impoverished family turned up seeking asylum at Dover now, Jack Straw wouldn't let them in. <br> <b>John Moloney</b><br> London</p>",

      "bodyText": "New Labour's reluctance to name the donor of \u00a32m should not be a surprise (Leader, January 3). Despite the rhetoric of open government, New Labour has consistently preferred secretive, backstairs deals, as the record of the party's national policy forum has shown. What is more worrying, however, is New Labour's cynical reliance on big money. The worst examples of this came in the New Year's honours list, where a knighthood went to Ronald Cohen for \"services to the venture capital industry\", (and presumably for giving \u00a3100,000 to the Labour party in 1997), while Ralph Hodge of Enron, the power company, gained a CBE for \"services to the power industries\" (and presumably for giving \u00a327,500 to New Labour). The dominance of New Labour by big money is a major reason that party membership has now dropped to less than two-thirds what it was at the last election. The cynicism now extends beyond the Labour party's ranks to the voting public as a whole. If millionaires buy into a political party, they are not doing so for disinterested motives. Trevor Fisher Stafford \u0095In January 1997 I, as a businessman, made a \u00a3100 donation to the Labour party to help it get elected. When in government it returned the \"favour\" by delivering on its promise to enact basic civilising measures such as a minimum income guarantee for workers, pensioners and the needy. What's the problem? The only difference between my donation and Paul Hamlyn's is its size - which illustrates what a grossly unequal society we still are. Good on Lord Hamlyn for doing something about it. Chris Trude London \u0095I had a good chuckle today; Lord Hamlyn was made a CBE in 1993 by the Conservative government for charitable services. Neil Browning Surbiton \u0095I reckon that if Paul Hamlyn and the rest of his impoverished family turned up seeking asylum at Dover now, Jack Straw wouldn't let them in. John Moloney London",

Asma Akhras, 25, who is from a wealthy and prominent London Syrian family, has left her job as an economist with the City bank JP Morgan and her family home in Acton, west London, to link her fortunes with Syria's youthful leader, Bashar al-Assad. Al-Assad, 35, who succeeded to the presidency on his father's death last June, trained as an eye specialist in London and is thought to have met his bride at a party hosted by the British Syrian community. Miss Akhras, whose father Fawaz is a heart specialist with a Harley Street practice, is from the Sunni Muslim tradition while the president is a member of the minority Alawite tradition. Abdel Bari-Atwan, editor of London-based Arab newspa per Al-Quds, said: \"It is a sort of reconciliation between the two traditions. He is presenting himself not as a sectarian leader but a leader for the whole of Syria. \"If they have a son, he will be from both sects, so this is highly significant.\" Al-Assad, who is reputed to be mild-mannered and bookish, was thrust into the political limelight six years ago when his older and more charismatic brother, Basil, who was being readied for the succession, was killed in a car crash. He was recalled from his studies in London and sent to a military academy, rising to become a colonel. He is said to have met the bride's father while he was studying at the Western Eye hospital in London. Miss Akhras's mother Sahar worked for the Syrian embassy, and she has two younger brothers. Al-Assad's only official title before the presidency was head of Syria's computer society, a position he used to promote nationwide computer literacy. He pushed for the introduction of the internet, which the regime had strenuously resisted as a \"threat to security\". Al-Assad is of a generation of western-educated new leaders, and has befriended Jordan's Sandhurst-educated King Abdullah, who succeeded King Hussein in 1999. Ranjeev Raman, a former lecturer of Miss Akhras at King's College, London, described her as outgoing. \"She was certainly very bright and very outgoing. She certainly seemed very Westernised and not in the least bit traditional.\" Miss Akhras' family is understood to have flown out to Syria on Christmas Eve. But even members of the British Syrian community who were in Syria for the holiday period had no idea the wedding was going on. Miss Akhras' father has been a prominent member of the Kensington-based Syrian Arab Association since it was founded in 1984. One member said: \"Most of the Syrian community know Dr Akhras well. He and his family are well respected.\" The wedding was attended only by family and marked with the briefest of notices in the government newspaper. This was accompanied by a large photograph of the president, but none of the bride, and the Syrian government has refused to release a picture of her. One reason for this was that the president was concerned about public reaction to a lavish and high-profile ceremony, observers said. Mr al-Atwan said: \"The main reason is that his father has just died and there is still a state of mourning. Also, his mother has never been in the public eye.

      "bodyText": "US financial markets surged ahead last night after the Federal Reserve came to their rescue by announcing a surprise interest rate cut to boost flagging confidence in the world's biggest economy. With share dealers calculating that cheaper borrowing costs would improve the outlook for company profitability, the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average closed up 299 points at 10,945 - a gain of almost 3% - and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index jumped 14%, or 324 points, to 2616. The Fed's move also arrested the dollar's sharp slide against the euro, which fell back below 93 cents after climbing to a six-month high of more than 95 cents earlier in the day. News of the move came too late to affect the British markets, but analysts expect it to prompt a sharp rally when London opens for business this morning. Despite a denial earlier in the day by Mervyn King, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, that UK rates would automatically follow US rates downwards, economists predicted that British business and consumers would soon be enjoying cheaper credit. Economists have warned that Britain is likely to suffer more from a US slowdown than other European economies because of closer investment and trade links. Traders had dumped sterling yesterday, betting that the euro was a safer haven in the event of a US slowdown, and sending the pound to a six-month low against the euro. Wariness about the impact of the American slowdown on corporate profitability did take its toll on the stock market, however, with the FTSE 100 closing down 134.8 points at 6039.9 before news of the Fed's shock action emerged. Sterling's value at yesterday's low point of 63.57p to the euro translates to less than 3.10 German marks, compared to last year's peak of DM3.45, providing a welcome boost for exporters to the euro zone.

      "bodyText": "Managers who cut down their hours or work from home are out-performing those who put in a traditional nine to five day, according to research. A survey of almost 200 people in senior jobs with flexible working arrangements such as job-shares or reduced hours, found that 70% had a 30% higher level of output and scored higher on resilience, leadership and commitment than their traditional full time colleagues. The study was presented at the British Psychological Society's occupational psychology conference in Winchester yesterday. John Knell of the Industrial Society, which helped compile the research, said: \"Employers find it hard to believe that flexible working among executives can work. And managers often regard mak ing such a request as career death. This research knocks both these misconceptions on the head.\" The researchers said their findings \"demolished\" the view that job-sharing was inappropriate for senior and managerial jobs.",

Keep detailed notes of them, including any distinguishing features of the voice and what was said. You should also tell your company about the threats.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Start taking action to tape any such future calls. Hopefully, you will not receive any more, but if you can borrow a Dictaphone (or persuade your company to purchase phone-recording equipment) then you can record any future threats. You should inform the caller that their call is being recorded.</p> <p><br>\u0095 I wonder if you can trace the person that left before you because of this bully in the company? This person could be very useful if they are prepared to stand up now to the bully. See what your solicitor says.</p> <p><br>\u0095 Get support from the UK National Workplace Bullying Advice Line (01235 212286) or visit their Internet site Bully Online at: www.successunlimited.co.uk</p> <p><br>\u0095 The Institute of Management have a guide, Dealing with Bullying at Work In a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a36.99) which is also well worth a look.</p> <p>Remember that (a) there is support out there and that (b) this nightmare will pass. It might be worth reading a self-help book or two on coping with worrying - this is a very difficult time for you, but you can find the strength to cope and get through it. Self-help books won't make the problem go away, but they can help you stop losing sleep over it. Good luck.</p> <p>Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton).</p> <p>Advice given to this problem should only be regarded as a guide based on the limited information provided by the letter-writer.

Keep detailed notes of them, including any distinguishing features of the voice and what was said. You should also tell your company about the threats. \u0095 Start taking action to tape any such future calls. Hopefully, you will not receive any more, but if you can borrow a Dictaphone (or persuade your company to purchase phone-recording equipment) then you can record any future threats. You should inform the caller that their call is being recorded. \u0095 I wonder if you can trace the person that left before you because of this bully in the company? This person could be very useful if they are prepared to stand up now to the bully. See what your solicitor says. \u0095 Get support from the UK National Workplace Bullying Advice Line (01235 212286) or visit their Internet site Bully Online at: www.successunlimited.co.uk \u0095 The Institute of Management have a guide, Dealing with Bullying at Work In a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a36.99) which is also well worth a look. Remember that (a) there is support out there and that (b) this nightmare will pass. It might be worth reading a self-help book or two on coping with worrying - this is a very difficult time for you, but you can find the strength to cope and get through it. Self-help books won't make the problem go away, but they can help you stop losing sleep over it. Good luck. Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes to Work (Purple House) and Managing Your Boss in a Week (Hodder &amp; Stoughton). Advice given to this problem should only be regarded as a guide based on the limited information provided by the letter-writer. No responsibility can be taken by Dr Mann for any outcomes following advice given.",
