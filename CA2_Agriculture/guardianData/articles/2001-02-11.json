If the outcome was predictable, the course the match took towards its conclusion would have confounded those who had anticipated an untroubled victory which would take Hibs back into second place in the Scottish Premier League. Leading, trailing and ultimately triumphing was not in the script envisaged by Alex McLeish. The shock of heading for the dressing room at half-time with the score 1-1 would be bewildering enough for supporters who had seen St Mirren subdued for all but a few seconds of that first half, but to see them establish an advantage early in the second could have induced mass trauma. But the Paisley side, threatened with relegation, managed to turn the game around by refusing to collapse under the pressure exerted by Hibs, bringing an energetic commitment to their work which, until the two-goal burst from David Zitelli after the hour, was sufficient to disrupt whatever complacency may have settled on the home players. St Mirren have been regarded as essentially a First Division team since their promotion to the top league this season and, as they were overpowered by Hibs' relentless thrusts in the first half, their most committed fans could not have presented an argument against the claim.

      "body": "<p>Culture and brewing may seem uneasy bedfellows, but Carlsberg of Copenhagen has been at the centre of artistic life in Denmark since the nineteenth century. </p> <p>Carl Jacobsen, the son of J.C. Jacobsen, the founder of the dynasty, was a voracious collector of art. His New Carlsberg Foundation funded the Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen that celebrates art down the centuries. </p> <p>The brewery he ran side by side with his father's plant not only has statues and art work in abundance but is a magnificent example of nineteenth-century industrial architecture. You enter the site through an imposing elephant gate modelled on the Minerva Square obelisk in Rome. </p> <p>A model of Thor, the god of thunder, rides his chariot on the roof while a second arched entrance beyond the elephant gate is surmounted by portraits of members of the Jacobsen family and key brewery employees. </p> <p>J.C. Jacobsen's original brewery - Gamle or Old Carlsberg - is now a brewery museum that offers a fascinating portrait of brewing during the industrial revolution when beer-making was transformed by steam power and refrigeration. Jacobsen's father was one of many small brewers in Copenhagen who made beers belonging to the ale family. When J.C. heard of the new style 'Bavarian beers' being made in Munich by cold fermentation and ageing (lagering) at low temperatures, he was determined to follow suit. </p> <p>He made the long and arduous journey by coach to Munich and returned with a pot of lager yeast in his hat box. At every stop, he doused the pot in cold water to keep the yeast cool. Back home, he used his mother's wash tub - on display in the brewery - to experiment with making the new style of beer. </p> <p>When his mother died, he used his inheritance to build a new brewery at Valby on the outskirts of Copenhagen. It had a constant supply of pure spring water and stood on a hill or berg in which he dug deep lager cellars. He named it after his son and Carl's brewery on a hill - Carlsberg - was born. </p> <p>The Bavarian beer appeared in November 1847 and was an instant success. J.C. encouraged Carl to tour the great breweries of Europe, including Britain, to learn brewing skills and eventually he opened his Ny or New Carlsberg brewery. In the manner of great dynasties, J.C. and Carl fell out spectacularly. Carl built a wall between the two sites and father and son did not speak for years, though they were reconciled shortly before J.C. died. </p> <p>J.C. Jacobsen pioneered a greater scientific understanding of brewing. While most other brewers worked empirically, judging temperatures by eye and the levels of steam rising from their vats, Jacobsen created the Carlsberg Laboratory. Inspired by the work of Pasteur, Jacobsen equipped the laboratory with microscopes and other instruments to enable him to understand the mysteries of fermentation. </p> <p>The work proved vital. As great industrial cities sprang up all over Europe and Scandinavia, workers demanded quality beer on a regular basis. Until the mid-nineteenth century, brewing was a seasonal affair, impossible to carry out in summer because of the risk of infection from heat and bacteria. </p> <p>When brewers attempted to make beer in summer they found their brews went sour. In the Carlsberg Laboratory, Jacobsen's chief scientist, Emil Hansen, used a microscope to discover that brewer's yeast was made up of dozens of different competing cells. Some were bad cells that lay dormant in cold weather but sprang to life in summer. </p> <p>Hansen managed to isolate one pure cell of yeast. By mixing it with a sugary solution, he produced more yeast that was then stored in a 'yeast bank'. It was offered to Jacobsen's main rival, Tuborg when its beer was infected, and even to his disaffected son's company. Eventually, Carlsberg's yeast was made available world-wide. It transformed brewing and was given the scien tific name of saccharomyces carlsbergensis , the basis of all lager brewing today. </p> <p>The story of Carlsberg comes to life in the museum. The original kilns where barley was turned into malt, and the tuns, coppers and lagering vessels that produced beer are all in place, along with primitive early bottling lines and the machine in which Hansen isolated his pure strain of yeast. </p> <p>The museum also illustrates the back-breaking and repetitive nature of work in the last century. Models show women on the bottling lines and men turning barley in kilns, digging used grain from tuns, drinking their daily ration of beer and reading socialist newspapers during their breaks. In the stables, horses are groomed in preparation for pulling ancient delivery carts. </p> <p>At the end of the tour visitors can enjoy a beer in a bar alongside the stables.

      "bodyText": "Culture and brewing may seem uneasy bedfellows, but Carlsberg of Copenhagen has been at the centre of artistic life in Denmark since the nineteenth century. Carl Jacobsen, the son of J.C. Jacobsen, the founder of the dynasty, was a voracious collector of art. His New Carlsberg Foundation funded the Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen that celebrates art down the centuries. The brewery he ran side by side with his father's plant not only has statues and art work in abundance but is a magnificent example of nineteenth-century industrial architecture. You enter the site through an imposing elephant gate modelled on the Minerva Square obelisk in Rome. A model of Thor, the god of thunder, rides his chariot on the roof while a second arched entrance beyond the elephant gate is surmounted by portraits of members of the Jacobsen family and key brewery employees. J.C. Jacobsen's original brewery - Gamle or Old Carlsberg - is now a brewery museum that offers a fascinating portrait of brewing during the industrial revolution when beer-making was transformed by steam power and refrigeration. Jacobsen's father was one of many small brewers in Copenhagen who made beers belonging to the ale family. When J.C. heard of the new style 'Bavarian beers' being made in Munich by cold fermentation and ageing (lagering) at low temperatures, he was determined to follow suit. He made the long and arduous journey by coach to Munich and returned with a pot of lager yeast in his hat box. At every stop, he doused the pot in cold water to keep the yeast cool. Back home, he used his mother's wash tub - on display in the brewery - to experiment with making the new style of beer. When his mother died, he used his inheritance to build a new brewery at Valby on the outskirts of Copenhagen. It had a constant supply of pure spring water and stood on a hill or berg in which he dug deep lager cellars. He named it after his son and Carl's brewery on a hill - Carlsberg - was born. The Bavarian beer appeared in November 1847 and was an instant success. J.C. encouraged Carl to tour the great breweries of Europe, including Britain, to learn brewing skills and eventually he opened his Ny or New Carlsberg brewery. In the manner of great dynasties, J.C. and Carl fell out spectacularly. Carl built a wall between the two sites and father and son did not speak for years, though they were reconciled shortly before J.C. died. J.C. Jacobsen pioneered a greater scientific understanding of brewing. While most other brewers worked empirically, judging temperatures by eye and the levels of steam rising from their vats, Jacobsen created the Carlsberg Laboratory. Inspired by the work of Pasteur, Jacobsen equipped the laboratory with microscopes and other instruments to enable him to understand the mysteries of fermentation. The work proved vital. As great industrial cities sprang up all over Europe and Scandinavia, workers demanded quality beer on a regular basis. Until the mid-nineteenth century, brewing was a seasonal affair, impossible to carry out in summer because of the risk of infection from heat and bacteria. When brewers attempted to make beer in summer they found their brews went sour. In the Carlsberg Laboratory, Jacobsen's chief scientist, Emil Hansen, used a microscope to discover that brewer's yeast was made up of dozens of different competing cells. Some were bad cells that lay dormant in cold weather but sprang to life in summer. Hansen managed to isolate one pure cell of yeast. By mixing it with a sugary solution, he produced more yeast that was then stored in a 'yeast bank'. It was offered to Jacobsen's main rival, Tuborg when its beer was infected, and even to his disaffected son's company. Eventually, Carlsberg's yeast was made available world-wide. It transformed brewing and was given the scien tific name of saccharomyces carlsbergensis , the basis of all lager brewing today. The story of Carlsberg comes to life in the museum. The original kilns where barley was turned into malt, and the tuns, coppers and lagering vessels that produced beer are all in place, along with primitive early bottling lines and the machine in which Hansen isolated his pure strain of yeast. The museum also illustrates the back-breaking and repetitive nature of work in the last century. Models show women on the bottling lines and men turning barley in kilns, digging used grain from tuns, drinking their daily ration of beer and reading socialist newspapers during their breaks. In the stables, horses are groomed in preparation for pulling ancient delivery carts. At the end of the tour visitors can enjoy a beer in a bar alongside the stables. This is arguably the most revealing aspect of the tour for Carlsberg (long ago merged with Tuborg) produces a large range of beers that have rather more character than the thin lager made in Britain in the group's Northampton brewery. It still produces a brown lager in the Bavarian style that encouraged Jacobsen to build his first brewery. Stronger Carlsberg and Tuborg beers, such as Carlsberg Elephant, have rich aromas and flavours, while Carlsberg Porter Stout is jet black and has a complex molasses and scorched malt character. In the warren of lagering cellars beneath the two breweries Carlsberg has launched a scheme to increase the appreciation of beer in Denmark. A small pilot brewery, capable of producing 1,000 litres of beer at a time, makes special beers under the label of Semper Ardens, the Latin for Always Burning, the brewery's motto that encourages constant innovation. To date, the Semper Ardens plant has produced an Abbey Ale modelled on the Belgian style first made by monks, a fruit beer made with cherries with Belgium again as the inspiration, and a rich and powerful Criollo Stout made with rye malt and the addition of two types of chocolate. A wheat beer will follow early this year. The beers are made available to 300 top restaurants in Denmark where the chefs are encouraged to design dishes to accompany the beer. The tart and slightly astringent Cerise cherry beer, for example, goes well with pickled herring dishes while Criollo Stout makes a marvellous dessert beer. Where to taste the beer Pubs Apollo Bryggeriet, Vesterbrogade.

The other is Jose Gomes De Moraes Edmilson, the elegant international centre-back who may cause him no end of regret at the Stade Gerland, which was sold out long ago. </p> <p>The last time Wenger saw Edmilson was in Sao Paolo last year, when he watched him before trying to sign him. Edmilson, 24, talked at the Lyon training ground about the meeting that could so easily have made him a defensive team-mate of his friend Silvinho.

'Thierry was a phenomenon at just 17 with Monaco. We played three years together with him mostly on the left flank. We hit it off straightaway. He frequently came round to our house where my wife would cook something up for us. We ate a lot of pancakes together. </p> <p>'Thierry had a few problems at the time. Everyone was calling him the new Ronaldo and wanted a part of him. I had more experience at 25 and tried to get him to concentrate only on his game. Now everyone wants to play like Thierry Henry.' </p> <p>Anderson has devastating close control and, at 30, retains his speed. He has also found an ideal partner this season in 27-year-old Steve Marlet, signed from Auxerre. Marlet, who has scored five goals in the Champions League, said, 'This is our big chance. We are unbeaten this year and go into the tie with a lot of confidence.' </p> <p>Another intriguing character for Arsenal to confront is Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9, formerly of West Ham. Fo\u00e9, who patrols in front of the Lyon back four, admits his spell in English football may have toughened him up, but is now causing him problems with French referees. He said: 'I have been sent off twice and booked a few times since I came to Lyon at the start of the season. </p> <p>It is all down to what I learned in English football. I am getting into trouble for things English referees would consider normal play. It is affecting my game. 'They thought I was too nice at first in England. Now they think I am too nasty in France. I am trying to forget what I was taught while with West Ham. I did love it there, but they needed the money and I wanted a club with a shot at the Champions League.' </p>",

      "body": "<p>Expending brain power trying to work out what goes on inside the mind of Nicolas Anelka has never seemed like much of a worthwhile exercise. Yesterday, however, watching him watching his comically miserable team from the bench as they self-destructed in their last plausible chance of salvation this season, well, you couldn't help but wonder. Scratching his ear as the whistles cascaded down, might he have asked himself what on earth he does now? </p> <p>Having finally manipulated the move back to Paris Saint-Germain, the only club in world football he felt would make him truly happy, where he can disappear to the sanctuary of his suburb to be himself every day rather than endure the horrors of London or Madrid, the dream is turning sour. </p> <p>He seldom scores. He endures the embarrassment of being dropped at a club which bills him as the modern icon. His team are in a mother of a mess. Crisis talk was on the tip of every Parisian tongue before Auxerre arrived at the Parc des Princes to knock a club who are languishing in the league, and bottom of their Champions League group, out of the French Cup. Crisis was an inadequate description. Try catastrophe, calamity, cataclysm. PS-G were behind inside 40 seconds. Oh dear. Come one minute 40 seconds they trailed 2-0 after an electric solo goal - the kind Anelka was once famed for - courtesy of the impressive Djibril Ciss\u00e9. Three minutes gone and PS-G fluked a penalty, which Mikael Madar (selected ahead of Anelka) sent with majestic nonchalance towards the corner flag. </p> <p>The locals were beyond fury, and the scathingly sarcastic banner behind the Tribune de Boulogne said it all: 'PS-G: The Benny Hill of football.' Their gallows humour, given their club have spent about \u00a355 million on players this season alone, is the most admirable thing about PS-G. Allez Auxerre urged the rival fans and allez Auxerre did, soaring further ahead. The prodigious Ciss\u00e9, dazzling, dynamic and blessed with killer confidence in front of goal (ring any bells, Nicolas?), scored a memorable fourth. Final score: 0-4. </p> <p>Another banner read: www.Shit Team.Fr , a dig at the fact PS-G conduct themselves more as a business than a club - an imprudent one at that. PS-G are the Inter of French football. Hideous overspending plus underperforming egos equals humiliating malaise. </p> <p>Anelka, being the most lauded and expensive of the lot, sums up their problems. 'He is not a football player any more,' mused one pundit. 'He is more noticeable off the field than on it. We talk about stories, advertising, arguments, but not about great goals.' Understandable, because he doesn't get many (his last came over a month ago). So they make do with tittle tattle, laughing at his indulging in amateur psychology about rumours that he repainted his red Ferarri blue to be more discreet. Fascinating? Not when you don't display style on the pitch to go with it. </p> <p>Worse followed. An unsavoury spat with a local writer who had the temerity to say 'Bonjour' to him at the training ground. Silence. 'I said Bonjour,' added the man from L'Equipe. Silence. The scribe was irked - what's wrong with a little common courtesy? - and told him so. It degenerated until Anelka decided to conclude their repartee with a desultory slap. With the exchange caught on camcorder and reproduced, frame by frame in a newspaper, the petty scandal died down only after his club encouraged Anelka to apologise - nobody really believed it was sincere. It is tiresomely, depressingly, familiar fare. </p> <p>It has all gone pear shaped. Anelka's move for more than \u00a320 million (a far more monstrous sum in France than in the wealthier leagues in Spain, Italy, England) had as much to do with marketing as competing. PS-G's partners, Canal+, stumped up all the cash in a bid to front a new image for the capital's club. Peter Luccin (since demoted to the third team) and Stephane Dalmat (since shipped out to Italy) also arrived from Marseille at significant cost as the club tried to touch base with the young, gifted, and black generation. They adopted the slogan 'Anelka's homecoming' and together with Nike they made a Spike Lee-style rap video to show at the stadium as pre-match entertainment. </p> <p>After a promising start PS-G were top of the league, Anelka was scoring goals, and everything was hunky dory. Then the lack of experience and the president's policy for buying marketable players irrespective of team balance backfired. The sporting director wanted to spend the Anelka money on Wiltord plus a reliable defender but the money men weren't interested. Breaking point arrived with the humiliation of a 5-1 lashing at Sedan. The rap generation, who didn't relate to the uncharismatic manager Philippe Bergeroo anyway, had no inclination to fight for him at all and he was history, to be replaced by the much loved motivator Luis Fernandez, who, coincidentally, had been working for Canal+. Fernandez was a legendary player for PS-G and is from immigrant stock. Surely he would turn things around? Not really. A frantic burst of transfer activity marked his arrival but PS-G remain rudderless. </p> <p>They lie within five points of the relegation zone, and will be out of the Champions League if they fail to win at Milan next week - unlikely. How gratifying can that be for Anelka, a Double winner with Arsenal, before adding a Champions Cup medal with Real and Euro 2000 with his country by the age of 21? </p> <p>He has mustered a mere seven league goals for PS-G. Nine modest French players whose names are barely recognised outside their own towns have struck more prolifically. The player billed as France's final piece of the jigsaw, the attacker they so desperately craved, after a dazzling performance against England at Wembley two years ago now makes it into the squad through name alone. He is nobody's first choice. Unlike Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, he doesn't possess the motivation to refine his game. Can he rediscover the will to improve himself? Doubtful. After explaining on his website that he missed a few games with injury, the doctor insinuated that he could have played had he wanted to. </p> <p>The motto on his personal scarf in the club boutiques proclaims: 'Anelka, proud to be Parisien.' He owes it to the fans, and club, who yearn for him to be their native idol, at least to contemplate whether he is proud of himself at the moment.</p>",

The prodigious Ciss\u00e9, dazzling, dynamic and blessed with killer confidence in front of goal (ring any bells, Nicolas?), scored a memorable fourth. Final score: 0-4. Another banner read: www.Shit Team.Fr , a dig at the fact PS-G conduct themselves more as a business than a club - an imprudent one at that. PS-G are the Inter of French football. Hideous overspending plus underperforming egos equals humiliating malaise. Anelka, being the most lauded and expensive of the lot, sums up their problems. 'He is not a football player any more,' mused one pundit. 'He is more noticeable off the field than on it. We talk about stories, advertising, arguments, but not about great goals.' Understandable, because he doesn't get many (his last came over a month ago). So they make do with tittle tattle, laughing at his indulging in amateur psychology about rumours that he repainted his red Ferarri blue to be more discreet. Fascinating? Not when you don't display style on the pitch to go with it. Worse followed. An unsavoury spat with a local writer who had the temerity to say 'Bonjour' to him at the training ground. Silence. 'I said Bonjour,' added the man from L'Equipe. Silence. The scribe was irked - what's wrong with a little common courtesy? - and told him so. It degenerated until Anelka decided to conclude their repartee with a desultory slap. With the exchange caught on camcorder and reproduced, frame by frame in a newspaper, the petty scandal died down only after his club encouraged Anelka to apologise - nobody really believed it was sincere. It is tiresomely, depressingly, familiar fare. It has all gone pear shaped. Anelka's move for more than \u00a320 million (a far more monstrous sum in France than in the wealthier leagues in Spain, Italy, England) had as much to do with marketing as competing. PS-G's partners, Canal+, stumped up all the cash in a bid to front a new image for the capital's club. Peter Luccin (since demoted to the third team) and Stephane Dalmat (since shipped out to Italy) also arrived from Marseille at significant cost as the club tried to touch base with the young, gifted, and black generation. They adopted the slogan 'Anelka's homecoming' and together with Nike they made a Spike Lee-style rap video to show at the stadium as pre-match entertainment. After a promising start PS-G were top of the league, Anelka was scoring goals, and everything was hunky dory. Then the lack of experience and the president's policy for buying marketable players irrespective of team balance backfired. The sporting director wanted to spend the Anelka money on Wiltord plus a reliable defender but the money men weren't interested. Breaking point arrived with the humiliation of a 5-1 lashing at Sedan. The rap generation, who didn't relate to the uncharismatic manager Philippe Bergeroo anyway, had no inclination to fight for him at all and he was history, to be replaced by the much loved motivator Luis Fernandez, who, coincidentally, had been working for Canal+. Fernandez was a legendary player for PS-G and is from immigrant stock. Surely he would turn things around? Not really. A frantic burst of transfer activity marked his arrival but PS-G remain rudderless. They lie within five points of the relegation zone, and will be out of the Champions League if they fail to win at Milan next week - unlikely. How gratifying can that be for Anelka, a Double winner with Arsenal, before adding a Champions Cup medal with Real and Euro 2000 with his country by the age of 21? He has mustered a mere seven league goals for PS-G. Nine modest French players whose names are barely recognised outside their own towns have struck more prolifically. The player billed as France's final piece of the jigsaw, the attacker they so desperately craved, after a dazzling performance against England at Wembley two years ago now makes it into the squad through name alone. He is nobody's first choice. Unlike Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, he doesn't possess the motivation to refine his game. Can he rediscover the will to improve himself? Doubtful. After explaining on his website that he missed a few games with injury, the doctor insinuated that he could have played had he wanted to. The motto on his personal scarf in the club boutiques proclaims: 'Anelka, proud to be Parisien.' He owes it to the fans, and club, who yearn for him to be their native idol, at least to contemplate whether he is proud of himself at the moment.",

      "body": "<p>What a momentous week for the American theme park. First, the $14 million Holy Land experience opened in Florida and walked straight into a barrage of righteous indignation. With the Ark of the Covenant recreated and a restaurant selling that no doubt wholesome sustenance the Goliath burger, this heaven on earth was met with an all-too-predictable fusilade of scorn from the Jewish lobby. The Nativity scene projected above the audience was denounced as offensive and the use of Christian imagery a 'perversion'. But of course, a dab of controversy never hurt a new start-up, did it? </p> <p>But on the other side of the continent, controversy was in short supply at the opening of California Adventure, the new extension to Disneyland at Anaheim. Disney doesn't do controversy; what it does is big numbers. This extension to Disneyland, which opened in July 1955, has cost a staggering $1.4 billion (for which you could just about get a Dome, give or take a golden handshake or two).The best-laid plans of mice and men, often go agley, however, and the Saturday before last week's opening everything went belly-up when the site had to be evacuated after a faulty amplifier in the Imax threw a hissy fit. The glitch was dismissed as being of little or no importance, but for such a billion-dollar investment to be jeopardised by a minor fault can have done little for the equanimity of the launch team. Those who fondly remember the foul-ups at the launch of our own benighted Dome may have felt the smallest kiss of a frisson that such a mighty organisation as Disney is not immune to the 'if it can go wrong, it will go wrong' school of cock-up. </p> <p>Be that as it may, California Adventure has 22 new shows, rides and attractions spread over 55 acres. As a paean to all things Californian, these are divided among three distinct 'themed lands' - Hollywood Pictures Backlot, Golden State and Paradise Pier. </p> <p>Crowning the Hollywood Pictures Backlot is the troublesome Imax, with its feature Soarin' Over California. Eighty-seven people at a time are lifted 40ft into the air inside a giant projection screen dome and all around is the stunning Californian landscape - the Golden Gate Bridge, the redwood forest, Napa Valley, Palm Springs, Yosemite National Park. And what's more, Disney's technical wizards ensure not only that you see California at its finest, but also that you experience the sounds and smells, too. Pretty nifty. There is also Golden Dreams, a 20-minute film celebrating the people and events that shaped the state. It features Whoopi Goldberg as the spirit of California. As someone who finds Miss Goldberg eminently resistible, I am perhaps not the ideal person to comment on the worth of this exercise. </p> <p>The Napa Valley is, of course, home to the Californian wine industry, which leads us on to the next area, Golden State. Here there is a restaurant devoted to Californian cuisine which features the wines of Robert Mondavi (yes, a real restaurant, serving real food, not ribs cooked in sump oil and liquorice). I think you'll find the merlot at $6 very potable. A minor gripe: for those of us who like good red wine, a good smoke is an essential accompaniment, but not at Disney, where smoking places are thin on the ground. </p> <p>Anyway, fortified by a glass or two of merlot, it's but a short step to It's Tough to be a Bug. Using the same technology as Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, it's an altogether wittier, wetter and smellier cinematic attraction, this time on insect life. Particularly beautiful is a stage curtain of red admirals that dissolves in an elegant fluttering of wings. Particularly unpleasant is having a large spider land on your bonce from out of the blackness. As for the bugs running along your seat...</p> <p>After the entrancing subterranean world of bugs, it's onwards and upwards to one of the new rides, Grizzly River Run, so called because the backdrop is a 110ft mountain carved in the shape of a grizzly bear. Touted as the world's longest and highest man-made river raft ride, it is also without doubt one of the wettest. Rafts which carry eight supplicants are racked up to the top of the mountain, spinning round all the while. And then good old gravity, with just a smidgen of help from Disney's imagineers, does the rest. Down and down and round and round you plummet through great gouts of white water, until you explode down the final 22ft drop. By this buttock-clenching moment you are so wet you don't care and, what the heck, around you go again. It's a superb ride which induces genuinely joyful high spirits. </p> <p>The two signature rides of California Adventure are found in Paradise Pier, a faithful recreation of a seafront pleasure ground, with boardwalks, fast-food outlets and handsomely evoked Fifties architecture. </p> <p>The Maliboomer is based on a traditional fairground test-your-strength machine and rockets passengers 200ft in the air, propelling them on a high-powered compressed air system. As at all the rides, there are warnings before you board that pregnant women or those suffering from heart conditions, bad backs and motion sickness should not participate. To the foregoing, add cowards. Yes, your correspondent funked this ride. There was no way I was going to play human yo-yos. There was no way I wanted see Mr Mondavi's merlot reappear. And, frankly, there was no way I wanted to have such an elevated view of Los Angeles. Yellow-streaked I am; terra firma is my natural habitat. </p> <p>So what on earth, you may well ask, was I doing contemplating getting on board California Screamin', the mother and father of all rollercoasters. Only the day before, I had been genuinely terrified by the Space Mountain ride in old Disneyland, a hellish descent in near total darkness. Now I was preparing to board the world's longest steel made looping rollercoaster. I think the need to conquer my fear had a little to do with it but, also, even an arrant coward gets bored with being called chicken after a while. Once the harness has encased you, the car pushes away and immediately comes to a halt. Not for long. In four seconds, you are screaming to 55mph and straight up a 45 degree slope. The rake of the bends, the plummets, the swoops, the thunder of rock music - it's all stunning, while the piece de resistance, a 360-degree loop round Mickey Mouse's face, is truly joyous. This is the king of rides. My fellow queasy rider, Jonathan Glancey of the Guardian, and I shared a heartfelt handshake of mutual congratulation as we stepped off. </p> <p>So, is the $1.4 billion investment worth it? As a theme park virgin, I was unsure of what to expect, except that I had distinct doubts about the intrusive presence of Disney characters, doubts confirmed when Minnie Mouse grabbed me. But this cavil aside, I can honestly say I haven't had so much innocent fun for many a long year. A beguiling recipe of high speed and technical wizardry makes for a wonderful way to spend three or four days. And now, if you'll excuse me, California Screamin' has just bucketed past my window at the Grand California Hotel. Nought-50 in four seconds...

      "bodyText": "What a momentous week for the American theme park. First, the $14 million Holy Land experience opened in Florida and walked straight into a barrage of righteous indignation. With the Ark of the Covenant recreated and a restaurant selling that no doubt wholesome sustenance the Goliath burger, this heaven on earth was met with an all-too-predictable fusilade of scorn from the Jewish lobby. The Nativity scene projected above the audience was denounced as offensive and the use of Christian imagery a 'perversion'. But of course, a dab of controversy never hurt a new start-up, did it? But on the other side of the continent, controversy was in short supply at the opening of California Adventure, the new extension to Disneyland at Anaheim. Disney doesn't do controversy; what it does is big numbers. This extension to Disneyland, which opened in July 1955, has cost a staggering $1.4 billion (for which you could just about get a Dome, give or take a golden handshake or two).The best-laid plans of mice and men, often go agley, however, and the Saturday before last week's opening everything went belly-up when the site had to be evacuated after a faulty amplifier in the Imax threw a hissy fit.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the three-and-a-half years since Henrik Larsson made his weak, undistinguished debut for Celtic, the extraordinary Swede has developed into the most formidable talent in Scottish football. </p> <p>Nobody who saw Larsson's puny physique, clumsy touch and general slow-wittedness on that first appearance, against Hibs at Easter Road in August, 1997, could possibly have predicted that he would gain unopposed entry to that pantheon of great Celtic strikers of the past 40 years. </p> <p>But whatever apprehension the Rangers defenders selected by Dick Advocaat for this afternoon's visit to Celtic Park may experience on the approach to the potentially decisive SPL match will stem directly from the prospect of a confrontation with Larsson. </p> <p>Aggregate figures of 106 goals from 141 appearances - his latest contribution was the double that helped beat the Ibrox side 3-1 in Wednesday night's CIS Insurance League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park - testify to his deadliness. </p> <p>Advocaat highlighted Larsson's all-embracing abilities last week, when his tribute to a dangerous rival included favourable comparison with Gabriel Batistuta and concluded with the assertion that the Swede is one of the most outstanding front men in the world. </p> <p>'Batistuta can be out of a game for all but one or two moments of the 90 minutes,' said the Rangers manager. 'During those short interventions, he can kill you with a goal or two. Larsson scores, too, but he is a better player, bringing others into the game and showing abilities that other strikers don't have.' </p> <p>Larsson, naturally guarded when discussing his own gifts or anything to do with his future at Celtic - Martin O'Neill is being urged to secure his signature on an extension even at two-and-a-half years short of the expiry of his current contract - opens like a daffodil in spring when the subject is a team-mate, specifically Chris Sutton. </p> <p>The former Chelsea forward's arrival for 10 times the money Celtic paid for Larsson has brought together a partnership that has terrorised defences. Larsson alone has delivered an astonishing 37 goals, all but six in the league. </p> <p>'What I've done wouldn't be possible without a partner like Chris,' said Larsson. 'You can't do that by yourself. Chris has been brilliant for Celtic, but, especially, for me. He's a big lad and a great target player. He takes away defenders and leaves me space in which to manoeuvre. He likes to work.' </p> <p>Significantly, Larsson was never heard to utter such praise for former sidekick, Mark Viduka. The lethargic tendency in the big Australian, unquestionably a talented forward, would insult the Swede's obsession with the work ethic. In Sutton, he has found a fellow traveller. </p> <p>Sutton repays the compliment, saying Larsson outshines Alan Shearer, the former England striker he partnered so productively at Blackburn when they won the Premiership in 1995. 'Henrik is the better player,' said Sutton. 'He's up and down the park and can do anything. He scores goals and has the pace to frighten anybody. Alan is a great player, but Henrik is quite simply superb.' Praise indeed. </p> <p>Sutton is just one of seven signings by O'Neill and Larsson is convinced that the new recruits and the Irishman's deep understanding of man management have been the most telling factors in Celtic's total transformation.

      "bodyText": "In the three-and-a-half years since Henrik Larsson made his weak, undistinguished debut for Celtic, the extraordinary Swede has developed into the most formidable talent in Scottish football. Nobody who saw Larsson's puny physique, clumsy touch and general slow-wittedness on that first appearance, against Hibs at Easter Road in August, 1997, could possibly have predicted that he would gain unopposed entry to that pantheon of great Celtic strikers of the past 40 years. But whatever apprehension the Rangers defenders selected by Dick Advocaat for this afternoon's visit to Celtic Park may experience on the approach to the potentially decisive SPL match will stem directly from the prospect of a confrontation with Larsson. Aggregate figures of 106 goals from 141 appearances - his latest contribution was the double that helped beat the Ibrox side 3-1 in Wednesday night's CIS Insurance League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park - testify to his deadliness. Advocaat highlighted Larsson's all-embracing abilities last week, when his tribute to a dangerous rival included favourable comparison with Gabriel Batistuta and concluded with the assertion that the Swede is one of the most outstanding front men in the world. 'Batistuta can be out of a game for all but one or two moments of the 90 minutes,' said the Rangers manager. 'During those short interventions, he can kill you with a goal or two. Larsson scores, too, but he is a better player, bringing others into the game and showing abilities that other strikers don't have.' Larsson, naturally guarded when discussing his own gifts or anything to do with his future at Celtic - Martin O'Neill is being urged to secure his signature on an extension even at two-and-a-half years short of the expiry of his current contract - opens like a daffodil in spring when the subject is a team-mate, specifically Chris Sutton. The former Chelsea forward's arrival for 10 times the money Celtic paid for Larsson has brought together a partnership that has terrorised defences. Larsson alone has delivered an astonishing 37 goals, all but six in the league. 'What I've done wouldn't be possible without a partner like Chris,' said Larsson. 'You can't do that by yourself. Chris has been brilliant for Celtic, but, especially, for me. He's a big lad and a great target player. He takes away defenders and leaves me space in which to manoeuvre. He likes to work.' Significantly, Larsson was never heard to utter such praise for former sidekick, Mark Viduka. The lethargic tendency in the big Australian, unquestionably a talented forward, would insult the Swede's obsession with the work ethic. In Sutton, he has found a fellow traveller. Sutton repays the compliment, saying Larsson outshines Alan Shearer, the former England striker he partnered so productively at Blackburn when they won the Premiership in 1995. 'Henrik is the better player,' said Sutton. 'He's up and down the park and can do anything. He scores goals and has the pace to frighten anybody. Alan is a great player, but Henrik is quite simply superb.' Praise indeed. Sutton is just one of seven signings by O'Neill and Larsson is convinced that the new recruits and the Irishman's deep understanding of man management have been the most telling factors in Celtic's total transformation. A team of under-achievers, they tamely allowed Rangers to win last season's title by a record 21 points but now enter today's third Old Firm league meeting of the campaign with a nine-point advantage. 'I think the biggest differences now,' said Larsson, 'are the influence of the new players - they are all strong, focused men - and the manager's ability to restore the self-belief of players who were already here. I think that was a bit low when O'Neill arrived. There's a greater level of concentration now. In the past, it's maybe not been as good.'

      "body": "<p>In one corner of the botanical gardens at Peradeniya near Kandy stands a lily-choked ornamental lake in the teardrop shape of Sri Lanka. And at the tip of the teardrop the Jaffna peninsula, stronghold of the Tamil Tiger separatists, has been blocked off and drained. </p> <p>Jaffna has been out of bounds to most Sri Lankans since 1983, but curiously, tourism flourishes despite civil war and the threat of terrorism. Indeed, the thousands of Britons who will arrive during the next few weeks to follow England's cricket tour are expected to lift visitor figures towards the half-million mark this year. </p> <p>Sri Lanka's ethnic war has had little impact on tourists, despite having lasted two decades. Thousands of lives have been lost as the Hindu Tamils have struggled against the Buddhist Sinhalese majority to establish a homeland in the North and East of the country. Although the LTTE - the Tamil Tigers' umbrella body - declared a month-long truce at Christmas (since extended by another month), government forces continue to battle through Elephant Pass, the strategic bottleneck at the foot of the Jaffna peninsula. All the while, the Norwegian government is trying to broker a peace deal - which does seem closer than at any time since the violence erupted. </p> <p>Give or take the odd roadblock you would not notice the strife - unless you used the buses. The Tigers' favoured strike method inside enemy territory involves suicide bombers and their usual targets are crowded buses and bus stands, the aim being to intimidate the masses. </p> <p>Few foreigners consider using Sri Lankan buses in any event - they are overcrowded and unreliable. Fewer still drive themselves. The average Sri Lankan driver sees a six-lane highway where the tourist sees a two-lane road and overtaking that water tanker on a blind bend is a matter of national pride. The only thing to do is to hire a car and driver - at around $US20 a day - and look at the scenery. </p> <p>Then there is the railway. Train trips along the coast or into the central highlands offer views no other mode of transport can - though booking ahead and first-class tickets are a must. Even second-class guarantees only standing room, no fun on the 12-hour Colombo to Badulla stopper. </p> <p>This is the island which gave the word 'serendipity' to the world, but it's no happy accident that one religion brings the whole population together. Sri Lanka is cricket crazy and victory in the 1995 World Cup only confirmed that. The game is everywhere: on television (almost daily); all over the papers (twice daily) and on every open space in every city, town and village, every waking hour of every day. </p> <p>If cricket is king, one man is king of kings and, perhaps, the best single hope of lasting religious tolerance. Muttiah Muralitharan, the off-spinner with the freakish wrist action, is a Tamil and the star performer in a team of Buddhists. </p> <p>'I am a human being. The fact that I am a Tamil doesn't matter,' he once said. There are those who claim the man with the bent elbow is superhuman. He recently reached 300 Test wickets, faster than anyone apart from Dennis Lillee, and looks a sure bet to set a world record for Test victims. And his 19 million compatriots couldn't care less about his ethnic grouping. </p> <p>'Murali' is Sri Lanka's best hope of beating England in the forthcoming Test series, and his every ball will be cheered, whistled and roared on by thousands. England's 'Barmy Army' of travelling supporters will need to be in full voice to make themselves heard. </p> <p>The Tests straddle three and a half weeks - time enough to do justice to a country the size of Ireland but which has more micro-climates than Europe, more than 400 species of bird and a thousand different shades of green. Lush is the word and it has nothing to do with Sri Lanka's fiery palm toddy, arrack. </p> <p>Galle, in the south-west corner of the island, stages the first Test. The seventeenth- century Dutch fort encloses much of the town and makes a daunting backdrop to the cricket stadium. Paint-peeled windows and sea-damp walls cannot conceal the splendour of the houses and Dutch churches. But the real gem is the New Oriental Hotel, which is neither new nor oriental. The dining room is watched over by portraits of the last two British monarchs, the bedrooms are ropey, but the gardens are a delight - though you wonder about a clientele which merits a sign forbidding spitting in the pool. </p> <p>Galle is in the middle of 120 miles of beaches and bays, mostly backed by hotels, guest houses and bars. The occasional quiet spot does exist - though it is generally tagged on to a colonial treasure recycled as an Elle Deco theme hotel. You can buy into a tropical dream for as little as $US70 a night. </p> <p>Heading north, past the Sinharaja rainforest and through the big sky country of Horton Plains, you hit tea country: the central highlands around Nuwara Eliya. Here it is all hill clubs and golf courses with a Scottish Highlands look and - in relative terms - a climate to match. </p> <p>Kandy, venue of the second Test, is set around an ornamental lake. Home of the tooth relic sacred to Buddhists, it is a bustling grid of weird and wonderful shops and hotels. Kandy forms part of the 'Cultural Triangle' with the temple complexes of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. It is also in striking distance of the stunning rock fortress of Sigiriya, the cave temples at Dambulla and a clutch of national parks flush with wild elephants, leopards, deer and monkeys. And birds everywhere. </p> <p>Colombo, site of the last Test, is the commercial pulse of the island; it is a busy city full of banks and grand buildings, chain hotels and smart bars. </p> <p>It is also home to more than a million people, many of them desperate to see their heroes beat the touring side. So quiet it will not be. But then, if you want quiet and you want to avoid all that sunshine and high humidity, you can hang on until the county season starts in England. It is only a few weeks away, and there is sure to be plenty of space around the grounds.</p> <p><strong>Top tips for the Test </strong></p> <p><strong>GALLE</strong> (First Test) </p> <p><strong>Top hotel </strong> <br><strong>Small:</strong> The Sun House. Beautiful, intimate but airy town house, Colonial feel, tasteful d\u00e9cor and a swimming pool in a frangipani orchard. Tel: 00 94 9 22624 <br><strong>Large:</strong> The Lighthouse. Modern 57-room hotel on coast west of city; superbly designed, with any numbers of bars, restaurants, pools. Tel: 00 94 9 23744</p> <p><strong>Top restaurant</strong><br> Closenburg Hotel, east of Galle city. Good food, beautiful views. <br><strong>Top bar</strong><br> Hundreds of them along beaches either side of city; Lion beer and a tube of mosquito repellent are all you need.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong><br> Have a sundowner at the Rampart Hotel after walking round the walls of the old town. Don't pay what the three-wheeler taxi (tuk-tuk) drivers ask. Be prepared to haggle - though not too much. </p> <p><strong>KANDY (Second Test)</strong></p> <p><strong>Top hotel </strong> <br><strong>Small:</strong> Stone House Lodge. Granite-built spacious and graceful house with half a dozen rooms and a master bedroom overlooking a tranquil garden and the distant Knuckles mountain range; large library and marvellous food including the best breakfasts in Sri Lanka. Tel: 00 94 8 232769 <br><strong>Large:</strong> Hotel Suisse. Overlooking lake opposite town, 100 rooms, most with a/c, and good public spaces including snooker room; Lord Mountbatten's wartime HQ boasts good gardens and a fine pool. Tel: 00 94 8 233025</p> <p><strong>Top restaurant</strong><br> Queens Hotel (opposite Temple of the Tooth) has good restaurant; for Chinese food try Flower Song (Kotugodella Vidiya) and, for home cooking, the splendidly named Sharon Inn (Saranankara Rd).</p> <p><strong>Top bar</strong><br> Unnamed pub next to Queens Hotel.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong><br> Wear socks to visit the Temple of the Tooth. A honeymooning friend picked up a collection of verrucas which lasted longer than his marriage. A lot longer. Don't forget to pack a mac or buy a brolly. Those afternoon showers may bring relief, but they're torrential.</p> <p><strong>COLOMBO (Third Test)</strong></p> <p><strong>Top hotel </strong> <br><strong>Small:</strong> Mrs Padmini Nanayakkara's (a couple of rooms with entrance, attached bath, net and fan set in a lovely little garden near the hub of the city. Tel: 00 94 1 73095 <br><strong>Large:</strong> Plenty of big, plush numbers but the Galle Face Hotel has them licked. Full of history and character; huge rooms, good restaurants and great views from terraced bars across Indian Ocean and Galle Face Green. Tel: 00 94 1 541010</p> <p><strong>Top restaurant</strong><br> The German Restaurant (Galle Face Court) for those who need a fix of pork and dumplings, draught beer and German wine.</p> <p><strong>Top bar</strong><br> Colombo is full of great bars; all the leading hotels have bars and nightclubs, but the Cricket Club Caf\u00e9 (Queens Rd) continues a theme, while architect Geoffrey Bawa's former office at the Gallery Caf\u00e9 (Alfred House Road) is stunning, with food to match.</p> <p><strong>Top tip</strong><br> Satisfy your longing for a cappuccino or skinny latte at Odel (Lipton Circus) or Paradise Road (Dharmapala Mawatha) after you've scooped up armfuls of brilliant clothes and materials. Don't cut it fine leaving for the airport on the way home. The security is massive and very time consuming - and don't wait till you get there to eat.</p> <p><strong>GETTING THERE</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.englandtours.net\">Tyson Tours</a> (01293 450600) has sold out for the first two Tests but has some places on a 17-day trip departing on 12 March to cover the Third Test and the one-day internationals.

Kandy forms part of the 'Cultural Triangle' with the temple complexes of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. It is also in striking distance of the stunning rock fortress of Sigiriya, the cave temples at Dambulla and a clutch of national parks flush with wild elephants, leopards, deer and monkeys. And birds everywhere. Colombo, site of the last Test, is the commercial pulse of the island; it is a busy city full of banks and grand buildings, chain hotels and smart bars. It is also home to more than a million people, many of them desperate to see their heroes beat the touring side. So quiet it will not be. But then, if you want quiet and you want to avoid all that sunshine and high humidity, you can hang on until the county season starts in England. It is only a few weeks away, and there is sure to be plenty of space around the grounds. Top tips for the Test GALLE (First Test) Top hotel Small: The Sun House. Beautiful, intimate but airy town house, Colonial feel, tasteful d\u00e9cor and a swimming pool in a frangipani orchard. Tel: 00 94 9 22624 Large: The Lighthouse. Modern 57-room hotel on coast west of city; superbly designed, with any numbers of bars, restaurants, pools. Tel: 00 94 9 23744 Top restaurant Closenburg Hotel, east of Galle city. Good food, beautiful views. Top bar Hundreds of them along beaches either side of city; Lion beer and a tube of mosquito repellent are all you need. Top tip Have a sundowner at the Rampart Hotel after walking round the walls of the old town. Don't pay what the three-wheeler taxi (tuk-tuk) drivers ask. Be prepared to haggle - though not too much. KANDY (Second Test) Top hotel Small: Stone House Lodge. Granite-built spacious and graceful house with half a dozen rooms and a master bedroom overlooking a tranquil garden and the distant Knuckles mountain range; large library and marvellous food including the best breakfasts in Sri Lanka. Tel: 00 94 8 232769 Large: Hotel Suisse. Overlooking lake opposite town, 100 rooms, most with a/c, and good public spaces including snooker room; Lord Mountbatten's wartime HQ boasts good gardens and a fine pool. Tel: 00 94 8 233025 Top restaurant Queens Hotel (opposite Temple of the Tooth) has good restaurant; for Chinese food try Flower Song (Kotugodella Vidiya) and, for home cooking, the splendidly named Sharon Inn (Saranankara Rd). Top bar Unnamed pub next to Queens Hotel. Top tip Wear socks to visit the Temple of the Tooth. A honeymooning friend picked up a collection of verrucas which lasted longer than his marriage. A lot longer. Don't forget to pack a mac or buy a brolly. Those afternoon showers may bring relief, but they're torrential. COLOMBO (Third Test) Top hotel Small: Mrs Padmini Nanayakkara's (a couple of rooms with entrance, attached bath, net and fan set in a lovely little garden near the hub of the city. Tel: 00 94 1 73095 Large: Plenty of big, plush numbers but the Galle Face Hotel has them licked. Full of history and character; huge rooms, good restaurants and great views from terraced bars across Indian Ocean and Galle Face Green. Tel: 00 94 1 541010 Top restaurant The German Restaurant (Galle Face Court) for those who need a fix of pork and dumplings, draught beer and German wine. Top bar Colombo is full of great bars; all the leading hotels have bars and nightclubs, but the Cricket Club Caf\u00e9 (Queens Rd) continues a theme, while architect Geoffrey Bawa's former office at the Gallery Caf\u00e9 (Alfred House Road) is stunning, with food to match. Top tip Satisfy your longing for a cappuccino or skinny latte at Odel (Lipton Circus) or Paradise Road (Dharmapala Mawatha) after you've scooped up armfuls of brilliant clothes and materials. Don't cut it fine leaving for the airport on the way home. The security is massive and very time consuming - and don't wait till you get there to eat. GETTING THERE Tyson Tours (01293 450600) has sold out for the first two Tests but has some places on a 17-day trip departing on 12 March to cover the Third Test and the one-day internationals. This costs \u00a31,559 per person sharing in five-star hotels (single supplement \u00a3349). Tickets cost \u00a320 for each one-day and \u00a39 per day at the Test. SriLankan Airlines (020 853 82001) has nine direct flights a week from Heathrow to Colombo with fares starting at \u00a3481. See www.lanka.net for the Ceylon Tourist Board.",

The Riffelalp Hotel stands smack in the middle of the Gornergrat ski area, with a view of the peak from almost every room. It was here, at 7,300ft, that the first Grand Hotel was built in 1884, quickly becoming the 'playground of European high society'. Gutted by fire in 1961, it had a decade as a three-star hostelry from 1988.

      "body": "<p>The shortlist of five titles for the Travelex Guide Book of the Year competition, organised in association with The Observer and Books etc, has been named. The judges were looking for a book that would excite interest in a country while satisfying the need for practical information. The winner will be announced in Escape on 25 March.</p> <p> The judges were Desmond Balmer, Travel Editor of The Observer; Gerry Conroy, Travelex's Group Director of Retail Operations; Jackie Crank, manager of the Broadgate branch of Books etc and Bing Taylor, managing director of Phoenix Press. </p> <p><strong> Cuba</strong> </p> <p>Rough Guides, \u00a310.99 </p> <p>As always from the series that won last year's award, this is the complete guide for the thinking traveller. The writing is enthusiastic and upbeat providing a fascinating cultural and political background. Everything is covered from music to sport. It will help find the hidden or alternative Cuba with no stone unturned ('take the left-hand fork at the petrol station'). This is especially helpful if you land in a small regional town where the state-run restaurants are poor. But this does make it the heaviest of the five guides shortlisted: 'I would read it before I travelled and take notes,' said Bing Taylor. A redesign gives a cleaner look but the small typeface is difficult to read. </p> <p><strong> Istanbul</strong><br> Time Out, \u00a310.99 <br> A new edition from an established series. The writing is quirky but captivating. 'You can hear the author's voice,' said Jackie Crank. The maps are excellent (you wouldn't need to buy another one). The history of the city is told with a lightness of touch and a gentle humour in the sidebars: 'atta Turk!' about the founder of modern Turkey, 'at the drop of a hat' about the fez and 'Uefa yes, EU no' about the links with Europe. As you would expect from Time Out , the listings are comprehensive but never boring. This was also the best mix of photographs and text. The cover is dull but, worse, the guide contains some naff local adverts. Any fears about this influencing the verdicts are soon lifted, however. Take this from the description of the Ceylan Inter-Continental: 'The style is brash, the tone set by a horrendous golden staircase spiralling its way upwards from the lobby area.' The hotel's advert on the inside back cover features a picture of the guilty staircase. </p> <p><strong> Costa Rica</strong> <br> The National Geographic Traveler, \u00a312.99 <br> The photographs, as you would expect from the National Geographic library, are outstanding. These are matched by personable writing ('I felt the rapport you might have with a good tour guide,' said Gerry Conroy) and thoughtful presentation. The book excited interest in this haven for wildlife. There were useful sections devoted to specific subjects - the world of butterflies, volcanoes and the grano de oro (the coffee bean of gold). The maps were clear and the regional guides provided a sense of place equipping the reader to plan a visit. The range of the listings for hotels and restaurants seemed limited and there was no phrase book or food glossary. The high production values made this good value at \u00a312.99. </p> <p><strong> Hiking in the USA</strong> <br> Lonely Planet, \u00a314.99 <br> An interesting move by Lonely Planet into new terrain, an enticing guide to the Great Outdoors, an often overlooked aspect of the American experience. 'This is something I wouldn't normally think about but it made it seem possible. By the end I thought, I'm going,' said Jackie Crank. The introduction sets up the history and geography of the westward expansion of the United States with good detail about the flora, fauna and wildlife. The layout and mapping have been thoughtfully assembled. The only drawback was the sheer volume of information required for day-by-day trekking. The project seemed too ambitious - who is it aimed at? It felt more like a reference book. </p> <p><strong> New York</strong> <br> AA Spiral Guide, \u00a39.99 <br> Sharp bite-sized information, ideal for the quick trip. The spiral format was enjoyed, thanks to the good paper quality. 'You can keep it in your pocket as you travel around,' said Gerry Conroy. Some of the detail was excellent, as were the walking map guides. Read this on the plane over and you could learn how to avoid the queues at the base of the Empire State Building or find the hidden Campbell apartment bar with its Tiffany stained-glass windows at Grand Central Station. Yet some of the judgments seemed uneven: 'They've recommended the worst restaurant in Brooklyn,' said New Yorker Bing Taylor. 'And do we need to know what a hot dog looks like?'</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shortlist of five titles for the Travelex Guide Book of the Year competition, organised in association with The Observer and Books etc, has been named. The judges were looking for a book that would excite interest in a country while satisfying the need for practical information. The winner will be announced in Escape on 25 March. The judges were Desmond Balmer, Travel Editor of The Observer; Gerry Conroy, Travelex's Group Director of Retail Operations; Jackie Crank, manager of the Broadgate branch of Books etc and Bing Taylor, managing director of Phoenix Press. Cuba Rough Guides, \u00a310.99 As always from the series that won last year's award, this is the complete guide for the thinking traveller. The writing is enthusiastic and upbeat providing a fascinating cultural and political background. Everything is covered from music to sport. It will help find the hidden or alternative Cuba with no stone unturned ('take the left-hand fork at the petrol station'). This is especially helpful if you land in a small regional town where the state-run restaurants are poor. But this does make it the heaviest of the five guides shortlisted: 'I would read it before I travelled and take notes,' said Bing Taylor. A redesign gives a cleaner look but the small typeface is difficult to read. Istanbul Time Out, \u00a310.99 A new edition from an established series. The writing is quirky but captivating. 'You can hear the author's voice,' said Jackie Crank. The maps are excellent (you wouldn't need to buy another one). The history of the city is told with a lightness of touch and a gentle humour in the sidebars: 'atta Turk!' about the founder of modern Turkey, 'at the drop of a hat' about the fez and 'Uefa yes, EU no' about the links with Europe. As you would expect from Time Out , the listings are comprehensive but never boring. This was also the best mix of photographs and text. The cover is dull but, worse, the guide contains some naff local adverts. Any fears about this influencing the verdicts are soon lifted, however. Take this from the description of the Ceylan Inter-Continental: 'The style is brash, the tone set by a horrendous golden staircase spiralling its way upwards from the lobby area.' The hotel's advert on the inside back cover features a picture of the guilty staircase. Costa Rica The National Geographic Traveler, \u00a312.99 The photographs, as you would expect from the National Geographic library, are outstanding. These are matched by personable writing ('I felt the rapport you might have with a good tour guide,' said Gerry Conroy) and thoughtful presentation. The book excited interest in this haven for wildlife. There were useful sections devoted to specific subjects - the world of butterflies, volcanoes and the grano de oro (the coffee bean of gold). The maps were clear and the regional guides provided a sense of place equipping the reader to plan a visit. The range of the listings for hotels and restaurants seemed limited and there was no phrase book or food glossary. The high production values made this good value at \u00a312.99. Hiking in the USA Lonely Planet, \u00a314.99 An interesting move by Lonely Planet into new terrain, an enticing guide to the Great Outdoors, an often overlooked aspect of the American experience. 'This is something I wouldn't normally think about but it made it seem possible. By the end I thought, I'm going,' said Jackie Crank. The introduction sets up the history and geography of the westward expansion of the United States with good detail about the flora, fauna and wildlife. The layout and mapping have been thoughtfully assembled. The only drawback was the sheer volume of information required for day-by-day trekking. The project seemed too ambitious - who is it aimed at? It felt more like a reference book. New York AA Spiral Guide, \u00a39.99 Sharp bite-sized information, ideal for the quick trip. The spiral format was enjoyed, thanks to the good paper quality. 'You can keep it in your pocket as you travel around,' said Gerry Conroy. Some of the detail was excellent, as were the walking map guides. Read this on the plane over and you could learn how to avoid the queues at the base of the Empire State Building or find the hidden Campbell apartment bar with its Tiffany stained-glass windows at Grand Central Station. Yet some of the judgments seemed uneven: 'They've recommended the worst restaurant in Brooklyn,' said New Yorker Bing Taylor. 'And do we need to know what a hot dog looks like?'",

In anticipation of the new competition, the Greek ferry companies have begun updating their fleets -20 new ferries have come into service in the last 18 months - and standards are improving but, for the coming summer, island-hoppers might do well to take Poffley's advice and avoid the 'tired old' Lalyssos and the Agios Rafail offering an experience which he describes as 'a cross between travelling on the back of a floating lorry and a building site'.",

Education Secretary David Blunkett wants the state to make it up to the pupils left standing at the school gate while their wealthier peers are whisked off for after-school treats and coaching. The 'Billy Elliot' revolution' aims to bridge the gap with up to \u00a3360 per pupil at some inner city schools to pay for activities broadening children's horizons and nurturing artistic talent - such as theatre visits, drama classes or music lessons. 'These ideas are a crucial contribution to targeting cash at youngsters and schools who need it most, to do what better-off parents or leafy suburban communities are already able to afford,' said one senior source. Blunkett will tomorrow publish his blueprint for the future of schools, expected to promise new targets for raising standards among 11- to 13-year-olds. Trainee teachers will also have their student debts paid off by the Government if they stay in subjects where there are serious shortages such as maths and science, in an incentive to recruitment. And the Excellence in Cities programme - turning around failing inner city schools and tempting middle-class parents to send their children - is expected to be extended to a third of all schools.

For the first time it will focus not only on improving disadvantaged children's exam scores and basic skills, but on their wider lives through the pupil learning credit scheme for cultural extras. Blunkett will make clear the activities for 11- to 16-year-olds - which could be after school or during the day - will open their eyes to an educationally stimulating world. 'Anyone who has been anywhere near a school to collect their kids, off to a piano lesson or ballet class or whatever, will have noticed the children that don't get to go, don't get any stimulation like that, and it's not the parents' fault - they just can't afford it,' said one source. The scheme is reminiscent of the film Billy Elliot in which a boy from a working- class background takes up ballet, to the mockery of his family and classmates, only to turn out to be a star. The number of \u00a32,000 bursaries helping disadvantaged teenagers go to university will also be more than doubled.

'We get the reputation for being a good corporate citizen. But it's not an esoteric, holier-than-thou thing.

NTL is pushing hard to wire up schools. So far, it has reached 5,200, rivalling BT. High street banks are investing millions in sending schools CD-roms and games-type machines that teach personal finance, a subject now on the National Curriculum. </p> <p>Royal Bank of Scotland deploys 4,000 staff in its education department and has gone into half of all English secondary schools. Goody bags full of branded accessories from sportswear companies are now increasingly common. And recently, schools have been offered 'Jazzy Books' - free classroom exercise books that carry advertising from soft drink companies, pop bands and sportswear groups. 'I thought if they're free, we'll have them,' said Penny Greenhalt, a primary school head in Hackney, east London. But she found them too commercialised, and 'I ended up throwing them away'. </p> <p>But the no-cost books, computers and gizmos are only one prong of the private-sector assault.

Last month the Department for Education and Employment confirmed that 20 local education authorities had either contracted out their back-office functions or were doing so. </p> <p>For the City, education 'support' is a growth sector. Investors Chronicle has twice in the past two months highlighted Nord Anglia, the Cheshire education services specialist, as a 'group cashing in as authorities seek to outsource work.' The paper expected the firm's profits to 'grow at more than 30 per cent over the next two years'. Nord Anglia's chairman, former teacher Kevin McNeany, last month sold \u00a3510,000 worth of shares to Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>Capital Strategies, the finance house, believes this sector will grow from \u00a31.6bn today to \u00a35bn within five years. Its education team managing director, Stan Patey, said Education Secretary David Blunkett had gone in 'quite hard to reform stagnation'. Asked whether outsourcing had saved money and demonstrated value, Patey said the work was in its infancy: 'You have to look at what they're doing in the prison service to see what is possible.' </p> <p>David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'Many heads have been so browned off with the service they have been getting that they'll take anyone.

Sometimes, however, I might even make it out of the house and on to Westbourne Grove, where west London's lovers of no-nonsense Indian food divide into two camps: Khan's devotees or habitu\u00e9s of the Standard. Not quite born but certainly raised there, I'm a Standard girl myself. Such is my fierce devotion, indeed, that I've never quite managed to set foot in (the much prettier) Khan's a few doors down. </p> <p>But the point I labour to make is that with certain cuisines, variety is not always the spice of life - indeed, surely for most punters the unctuous predictability of an Indian meal is an important part of its appeal. You can move from high street to high street around the country and it will be a bit like playing the Generation Game 's conveyor belt: 'Ah, chicken tikka masala, vindaloo, cuddly toy, sag aloo...' You don't really want surprises in an Indian restaurant, you want fuel and beer. However, I have just experienced a new benchmark in culinary decadence - not just the eating of a non-takeaway Indian on a Monday night, but a slice of truly Ghetto-Fabulous (Chelsea division) decadence: eating an Indian meal on a Monday night at the freshly Michelin-starred Zaika, wherein chef Vineet Bhatia creates miracles. </p> <p>Zaika is a sitar symphony of beiges and browns, creams and biscuits, with leathery banquettes and tasselly cushions, a blast of a purple wall and waiters in chocolate-coloured Nehru jackets. There are two big rooms in which the tables are spaced at respectful distances. It's a warm, stylish space and, on this January Monday, heaving with the Chelsea Settlers - a stylish though not very warm collection of soign\u00e9e blondes in their early thirties boasting a variety of Euro-accents, a wardrobe of milky cashmeres and Labrador-coloured suedes accessorised by vast, blindingly Klieg-like rings worn on French-manicured hands that don't do dishes. Plus, of course, their wives. It's not just another country down here in SW3, it's several other countries. Interestingly, the clientele includes the highest proportion of smokers I've seen in any restaurant for yonks. </p> <p>Crunching on mini-poppadums, the partner and I pore over the menu for a very long time: descriptions are intriguing and choices hard. Eventually I settle on the jhinga khichdi - an Indian risotto with red onion and coriander topped with crispy prawn - and the titar mussalam - pheasant with black lentils, punjabi spices and new potatoes in a black-lentil sauce with morels. </p> <p>After discovering that the scallops are off this evening (quite right, too, on a Monday), the partner opts for the dhunga machli tikka - tandoori-smoked salmon with spices, mustard and dill - and veinchinna mamsun - a spicy lamb masala, dry-cooked with powdered bay leaf, peppercorn, cinnamon and tamarind rice. On the side, we overindulge in a selection of rice, raita, cauliflower florets and paratha. Somehow, beer doesn't hit the right note, so we select a white wine that promises not to fight the impending flavour-fest. </p> <p>And now to the boring bit: the superlatives. Of course, one expects a Michelin-starred kitchen to avoid clich\u00e9 - but to do so with a cuisine that has, on these shores at least, become its own clich\u00e9 is even more of a feat. Everything we ate managed to exorcise the ghosts of a thousand Indian meals past and reveal them to be, if they were lucky, merely tragically bludgeoned and abased versions of this meal. In the words of the partner, who was not only slightly stressed on arrival, but is also, professionally, a visual person: 'The taste of everything you eat always comes through the spices.' I couldn't have put it better myself. </p> <p>Most of us like to think we know the meaning of words like tikka and biryani, but if they're being bandied about by Vineet Bhatia, it is probably best to unlearn everything. For instance, such was the intense subtlety - not, I think, a contradiction in terms - of the tandoori-smoked salmon that, in my book at least, 'tandoori' need no longer describe something made stringy and florid in an industrial-strength oven - even though I'm usually quite happy with stringy and florid. </p> <p>But despite having done so at length, it is almost pointless (if not insulting) to compare Zaika with your local Indian - at this level one should really only compare like with like. Except that in this case there is no 'like' because I haven't been to Tamarind, the only other London 'Indian' with a Michelin star, thus Zaika must go it alone, boldly, as a first-class restaurant by anybody's standard (let alone the Standard's standard). If the kitchen can sustain this level of cooking, it will be worthy of another star next year. </p> <p>In short, this turned out to be one of the very best meals I have ever eaten in London. And if further proof were needed, how often have you been seriously tempted by an Indian dessert menu?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Expending brain power trying to work out what goes on inside the mind of Nicolas Anelka has never seemed like much of a worthwhile exercise. Yesterday, however, watching him watching his comically miserable team from the bench as they self-destructed in their last plausible chance of salvation this season, well, you couldn't help but wonder. Scratching his ear as the whistles cascaded down, might he have asked himself what on earth he does now? </p> <p>Having finally manipulated the move back to Paris Saint-Germain, the only club in world football he felt would make him truly happy, where he can disappear to the sanctuary of his suburb to be himself every day rather than endure the horrors of London or Madrid, the dream is turning sour. </p> <p>He seldom scores. He endures the embarrassment of being dropped at a club which bills him as the modern icon. His team are in a mother of a mess. Crisis talk was on the tip of every Parisian tongue before Auxerre arrived at the Parc des Princes to knock a club who are languishing in the league, and bottom of their Champions League group, out of the French Cup. Crisis was an inadequate description. Try catastrophe, calamity, cataclysm. PS-G were behind inside 40 seconds. Oh dear. Come one minute 40 seconds they trailed 2-0 after an electric solo goal - the kind Anelka was once famed for - courtesy of the impressive Djibril Ciss\u00e9. Three minutes gone and PS-G fluked a penalty, which Mikael Madar (selected ahead of Anelka) sent with majestic casualty towards the corner flag. </p> <p>The locals were beyond fury, and the scathingly sarcastic banner behind the Tribune de Boulogne said it all: 'PS-G: The Benny Hill of football.' Their pals behind the opposite goal responded by dancing and belting out ironic chants of 'Allez Auxerre!'. Their gallows humour, given their club have spent about \u00a355 million on players this season alone, is the most admirable thing about PS-G. And allez Auxerre did, soaring even further ahead. The prodigious Ciss\u00e9, dazzling, dynamic and blessed with killer confidence in front of goal (ring any bells Nicolas?) scored a memorable fourth. Final score: 0-4. </p> <p>Another banner read: www.ShitTeam.Fr, a dig at the fact PS-G conduct themselves more as a business than a club - an imprudent one at that. PS-G are the Inter of French football. Hideous overspending plus underperforming egos equals humiliating malaise. </p> <p>Anelka, being the most lauded, infamous and expensive of the lot, sums up their problems. 'He is not a football player any more,' mused one pundit. 'He is more noticeable off the field than on it. We talk about stories, advertising, arguments, but not about great goals.' Understandable, because he doesn't get many (his last came over a month ago). So they make do with tittle tattle, laughing at his indulging in amateur psychology about rumours that he repainted his red Ferarri blue to be more discreet. Fascinating? Not when you don't display style on the pitch to go with it. </p> <p>Worse came with an unsavoury spat aimed at a local writer who had the temerity to say 'Bonjour' to him at the training ground. Silence. 'I said Bonjour,' added the man from L'Equipe. Silence. The scribe was irked - what's wrong with a little common courtesy? - and told him so. It degenerated into an exchange of insults, until Anelka decided to conclude their repartee with a desultory slap. With all the pleasantries caught on camcorder and reproduced, frame by frame in a gossip newspaper, the petty scandal only died down after his club encouraged Anelka to apologise - nobody really believed it was sincere. It is tiresomely, depressingly, familiar fare. </p> <p>It has all gone pear shaped. Anelka's move for more than \u00a320 million (a far more monstrous sum in France than in the wealthier leagues in Spain, Italy, England),had as much to do with marketing as competing. PS-G's partners, Canal+, stumped up all the cash in a bid to front a new image for the capital's club. Peter Luccin (since demoted to the third team) and Stephane Dalmat (since shipped out to Italy) also arrived from Marseille at significant cost as the club tried to touch base with the young, gifted, and black generation from the suburbs. They adopted the slogan 'Anelka's homecoming' as a symbol. Together with Nike they made a Spike Lee-style rap video to show at the stadium as pre-match entertainment. </p> <p>After a promising start PS-G were top of the league, Anelka was scoring goals, and everything was hunky dory. Then the lack of experience and guidance began to show and they fell away. The president's policy for buying marketable players irrespective of team balance backfired. The sporting director wanted to spend the Anelka money on Wiltord plus a reliable defender but the money men weren't interested. Breaking point arrived with the utter humiliation of a 5-1 lashing at Sedan. The rap generation, who didn't relate to the uncharismatic manager Philippe Bergeroo anyway, had no inclination to fight for him at all and he was history, to be replaced by the much loved, Keegan-esque motivator Luis Fernandez, who coincidentally, had been working as a commentator for Canal+. </p> <p>Fernandez was a legendary player for PS-G and is from immigrant stock. Surely he would turn things around? Not really. A frantic burst of activity in the transfer market accompanied his arrival but this is still a team in need of leadership. </p> <p>But PS-G remain rudderless. They have slumped to within five points of the relegation zone, and will be over and out of the Champions League if they fail to win at AC Milan next week - unlikely. How gratifying can that be for Anelka, who won the Double with Arsenal, before adding a Champions Cup medal with Real and the European Championship with his country by the age of 21? </p> <p>He has mustered a mere seven league goals for PS-G. Nine modest French players whose names are barely recognised outside their own towns have struck more prolifically than he. The player billed as France's final piece of the jigsaw, the attacker they so desperately craved, after a dazzling performance against England at Wembley two years ago now makes it into the squad through name alone. He is nobody's first choice up front. Unlike Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet he doesn't possess the motivation to refine his game. Can he rediscover the will to improve himself? Doubtful. After explaining on his website that he missed a few games with injury, the doctor insinuated that he could have played had he wanted to. </p> <p>The motto on his personal scarf in the club boutiques proclaims, 'Anelka, proud to be Parisien.' He owes it to the fans, and club, who yearn for him to be their native idol, to at least contemplate whether he is proud of himself at the moment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Expending brain power trying to work out what goes on inside the mind of Nicolas Anelka has never seemed like much of a worthwhile exercise. Yesterday, however, watching him watching his comically miserable team from the bench as they self-destructed in their last plausible chance of salvation this season, well, you couldn't help but wonder. Scratching his ear as the whistles cascaded down, might he have asked himself what on earth he does now? Having finally manipulated the move back to Paris Saint-Germain, the only club in world football he felt would make him truly happy, where he can disappear to the sanctuary of his suburb to be himself every day rather than endure the horrors of London or Madrid, the dream is turning sour. He seldom scores. He endures the embarrassment of being dropped at a club which bills him as the modern icon. His team are in a mother of a mess. Crisis talk was on the tip of every Parisian tongue before Auxerre arrived at the Parc des Princes to knock a club who are languishing in the league, and bottom of their Champions League group, out of the French Cup. Crisis was an inadequate description. Try catastrophe, calamity, cataclysm. PS-G were behind inside 40 seconds. Oh dear. Come one minute 40 seconds they trailed 2-0 after an electric solo goal - the kind Anelka was once famed for - courtesy of the impressive Djibril Ciss\u00e9. Three minutes gone and PS-G fluked a penalty, which Mikael Madar (selected ahead of Anelka) sent with majestic casualty towards the corner flag. The locals were beyond fury, and the scathingly sarcastic banner behind the Tribune de Boulogne said it all: 'PS-G: The Benny Hill of football.' Their pals behind the opposite goal responded by dancing and belting out ironic chants of 'Allez Auxerre!'. Their gallows humour, given their club have spent about \u00a355 million on players this season alone, is the most admirable thing about PS-G. And allez Auxerre did, soaring even further ahead. The prodigious Ciss\u00e9, dazzling, dynamic and blessed with killer confidence in front of goal (ring any bells Nicolas?) scored a memorable fourth. Final score: 0-4. Another banner read: www.ShitTeam.Fr, a dig at the fact PS-G conduct themselves more as a business than a club - an imprudent one at that. PS-G are the Inter of French football. Hideous overspending plus underperforming egos equals humiliating malaise. Anelka, being the most lauded, infamous and expensive of the lot, sums up their problems. 'He is not a football player any more,' mused one pundit. 'He is more noticeable off the field than on it. We talk about stories, advertising, arguments, but not about great goals.' Understandable, because he doesn't get many (his last came over a month ago). So they make do with tittle tattle, laughing at his indulging in amateur psychology about rumours that he repainted his red Ferarri blue to be more discreet. Fascinating? Not when you don't display style on the pitch to go with it. Worse came with an unsavoury spat aimed at a local writer who had the temerity to say 'Bonjour' to him at the training ground. Silence. 'I said Bonjour,' added the man from L'Equipe. Silence. The scribe was irked - what's wrong with a little common courtesy? - and told him so. It degenerated into an exchange of insults, until Anelka decided to conclude their repartee with a desultory slap. With all the pleasantries caught on camcorder and reproduced, frame by frame in a gossip newspaper, the petty scandal only died down after his club encouraged Anelka to apologise - nobody really believed it was sincere. It is tiresomely, depressingly, familiar fare. It has all gone pear shaped. Anelka's move for more than \u00a320 million (a far more monstrous sum in France than in the wealthier leagues in Spain, Italy, England),had as much to do with marketing as competing. PS-G's partners, Canal+, stumped up all the cash in a bid to front a new image for the capital's club. Peter Luccin (since demoted to the third team) and Stephane Dalmat (since shipped out to Italy) also arrived from Marseille at significant cost as the club tried to touch base with the young, gifted, and black generation from the suburbs. They adopted the slogan 'Anelka's homecoming' as a symbol. Together with Nike they made a Spike Lee-style rap video to show at the stadium as pre-match entertainment. After a promising start PS-G were top of the league, Anelka was scoring goals, and everything was hunky dory. Then the lack of experience and guidance began to show and they fell away. The president's policy for buying marketable players irrespective of team balance backfired. The sporting director wanted to spend the Anelka money on Wiltord plus a reliable defender but the money men weren't interested. Breaking point arrived with the utter humiliation of a 5-1 lashing at Sedan. The rap generation, who didn't relate to the uncharismatic manager Philippe Bergeroo anyway, had no inclination to fight for him at all and he was history, to be replaced by the much loved, Keegan-esque motivator Luis Fernandez, who coincidentally, had been working as a commentator for Canal+. Fernandez was a legendary player for PS-G and is from immigrant stock. Surely he would turn things around? Not really. A frantic burst of activity in the transfer market accompanied his arrival but this is still a team in need of leadership. But PS-G remain rudderless. They have slumped to within five points of the relegation zone, and will be over and out of the Champions League if they fail to win at AC Milan next week - unlikely. How gratifying can that be for Anelka, who won the Double with Arsenal, before adding a Champions Cup medal with Real and the European Championship with his country by the age of 21? He has mustered a mere seven league goals for PS-G. Nine modest French players whose names are barely recognised outside their own towns have struck more prolifically than he. The player billed as France's final piece of the jigsaw, the attacker they so desperately craved, after a dazzling performance against England at Wembley two years ago now makes it into the squad through name alone. He is nobody's first choice up front. Unlike Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet he doesn't possess the motivation to refine his game. Can he rediscover the will to improve himself? Doubtful. After explaining on his website that he missed a few games with injury, the doctor insinuated that he could have played had he wanted to. The motto on his personal scarf in the club boutiques proclaims, 'Anelka, proud to be Parisien.' He owes it to the fans, and club, who yearn for him to be their native idol, to at least contemplate whether he is proud of himself at the moment.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When he was a schoolboy at Twmpath secondary modern in Pontypool, there was nothing Michael Leahy liked more than playing rugby. He was a good player - representing Pontypool schoolboys and its youth team in a period when the town gave the great Welsh sides some of their most gifted players. </p> <p>But what gave him most pleasure was dealing out a good thrashing to the local grammar school, West Mon. 'We always wanted to beat the grammar school boys, and we generally did,' Leahy remembers. Among the pupils at West Mon was a boy called John Bryant, who later left for Cambridge and then joined British Steel, where he would work for 30 years. </p> <p>As a rising star in the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, Leahy's path was to cross Bryant's many times. When Bryant became joint chief executive of Corus, formed by the merger of British Steel and Dutch company Hoogovens in 1999, the two debated the future of the company's 30,000 British workers. Leahy says: 'We were told that they were going to grow the business, and that the present plant configuration would remain.' </p> <p>Ten days ago those hopes were shattered. At a stroke Corus chairman Sir Brian Moffat cut 6,050 jobs, ended steelmaking at the mighty Llanwern plant in Newport, closed the Ebbw Vale works and cut back at three others. Wales took the brunt. </p> <p>The cuts had started last year, when Bryant and his co-chief executive, Fokko Van Duyne, cut 4,500 jobs as part of the merger. But the latest package was far worse. By then, Bryant and Van Duyne had been sacked for not being ruthless enough. </p> <p>Leahy is now at the centre of efforts to construct a rescue package. He is busy. As he talks at his office, the phone rings eight times. </p> <p>Leahy says the latest cuts represents a U-turn in Corus's strategy because it will involve transporting crude steel made on Teesside to finishing plants including Llanwern in Wales - and back again. He points out that Bryant consistently defended integrated plants such as Llanwern, because they avoided these expensive transport costs. </p> <p>But he also says Bryant was motivated by honouring his commitment not to close plants. 'I believe he desperately wanted to keep the current plant configuration. John was a Welshman. He came from the communities that will be hit. I believe he was an honest man. I hope I am the same.' </p> <p>While their geographical origins are similar, Leahy's were more rooted in working-class culture. He grew up in a terraced house with a tin bath and an outside toilet; he left school at 15 and went to work at the Planteg stainless steel works near Pontypool. </p> <p>His father was a union official and local councillor. The 16-year-old Michael became an ISTC committee member, and, at 17, branch representative. At 18 a rugby injury left him focusing all his time on the union. </p> <p>Lord Brookman, Leahy's predecessor as general secretary of the ISTC, remembers: 'Michael was the union's youngest-ever official. That is quite an achievement. He earned a reputation for being tough - and for complete loyalty.' </p> <p>Leahy was one of an influx of young workers stirred by the radicalism of the white-hot Sixties, and excited by the productive possibilities for the industry as new technologies such as electric arc furnaces replaced old open hearth processes. </p> <p>He recalls: 'The chairman and secretary of the branch were in their sixties, and they always took off their cloth caps to the managers, who tended to be old army officers. I'd turn up with long hair and in my Carnaby street gear and be fairly direct. The officers found it difficult. </p> <p>'The younger men were more radical. There was a feeling that they were not properly done by, and we succeeded in getting better pay and conditions.' </p> <p>In 1974 Leahy married Irene Powell, the daughter of a union official from Ebbw Vale, who knew the young man from Pontypool and recognised his ambition. </p> <p>Three years later he was promoted to divisional organiser and moved to Yorkshire, where the threat to jobs was lower and the focus was on agreeing productivity deals. </p> <p>Leahy set up home in Barnsley. But in 1980, he was sent to Birmingham to organise pickets in the Midlands region during the three-month national steel strike, called after British Steel made what was considered an unacceptable pay offer. </p> <p>'It was a difficult job at a very difficult time for steelworkers. They went three months without pay. The police, and the Special Patrol Group particularly, were very aggressive. In the end I believe we were led by the nose. The Thatcher government wanted a fight with a union, and it picked the ISTC to warm up for the miners.' </p> <p>The strike strengthened neither the union nor British Steel, which continued to make the losses it had suffered in the Seventies, and faced growing imports of foreign product. </p> <p>Leahy says the period taught him that strikes could only be a last resort. After the strike, steelworkers faced continuing problems as British Steel - in order to cut costs, create profits and prepare for privatisation - brought in new working patterns and shook up plants that over many years had grown haphazardly. State ownership ended in 1988. </p> <p>Leahy remained in the Midlands. 'Most of my time was spent dealing with job losses, closures and trying to mitigate the damage.' </p> <p>At one point the union tried to save the condemned Brockhurst District re-rolling plant, which employed 500 people in Smethwick, by taking it over. But British Steel put paid to this offer by refusing the union the 'quota' that would allow it to sell the plant's output. The plant closed. Last month, nearly 20 years later the ISTC offered to buy out Llanwern in order to save jobs. Corus again refused. </p> <p>The failure of such schemes reflects the company's culture, says Leahy. 'It is very paternalistic. It believes it knows the right thing to do, and it does not take other suggestions very seriously.' </p> <p>Leahy opposed privatisation, claiming shareholders' interests would take precedence over the need for investment. He believes he has been vindicated, and points to the \u00a3700 million special dividend paid after the 1999 merger. In 1993 he became assistant general secretary and, along with Lord Brookman, set about changing the union as it faced yet further pressure. </p> <p>Under Moffat, who himself took over from Bob Scholey as chairman and chief executive in 1993, productivity improvements and further working pattern changes were introduced. </p> <p>By 1996, it appeared that Moffat's strategy was paying off. That year British Steel made a profit of \u00a31 billion. </p> <p>But then steel prices slumped and the pound began its ascent on foreign exchange markets, undercutting British Steel's competitiveness. Against this background, the 1999 merger took place. With Bryant's assurances, Leahy was hopeful for the future. Now, instead of a fellow Welshman, he stands eyeball to eyeball with Moffat. 'As my predecessor said, he's a man who can't look you in the eye.' He has three days left to persuade Moffat to change his mind. But as Leahy himself points out, Corus has not been open to suggestions so far. Few give him a chance. </p> <p>'If they had a workforce who had not been so committed to increasing productivity, you could understand their attitude. But we have delivered everything they asked. It's a tragedy really, for steel, for Wales and for British manufacturing.' </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name:</strong> Michael Leahy </p> <p><strong> Job title: </strong> General Secretary of the ISTC steel union </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> 1965: Joined ISTC. 1966-77: On Strip Trade Board. 1977: Organiser, Yorkshire area. 1980: transferred to Midlands; organised strikes. 1993: Assistant General Secretary. 1996: joined Labour Party NEC. 1998: elected ISTC General Secretary. </p> <p><strong> Other positions: </strong> Labour's National Policy Forum; TUC General Council . </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Rugby</p>",

      "body": "<p>Debbie is a rare breed of employee. She pays her boss \u00a350 every time she goes to work, and considers it money well spent. As a table-dancer in one of London's biggest clubs, the 23-year-old can expect to pull in \u00a3300 a night. 'Maybe \u00a3500 if it's Christmas or it's bonus season in the City,' the part-time student says. </p> <p>Her best pay came courtesy of the millennium bug. Legions of IT professionals, their wallets stuffed with huge bonuses from working overtime preparing for Y2K, partied like it was, well, 1999. Over the New Year period Debbie's club boasted more than 100 dancers each night, compared with 15 on a normal Tuesday or Wednesday. </p> <p>But if the likes of Debbie are enjoying the good times - table dancing is currently in vogue, with even blue-blooded Tatler magazine holding its annual Christmas bash at Stringfellows last year - the industry itself is in turmoil. A raft of US table dancing firms are now coming to Britain, sparking an unseemly and damaging turf war in a business desperate to gain some credibility after a series of high-profile flops frightened off potential investors </p> <p>The stakes are high. Five years ago there were only a handful of table-dancing clubs in the UK. Now there are around 300. Most of the big players believe there will be more than 1,000 clubs in five years. And no wonder. A big club, such as the For Your Eyes Only Club (FYEO) in London's Park Royal, makes an annual profit of \u00a31 million on a turnover of around \u00a33m. </p> <p>Table dancing is already a \u00a31 billion UK industry. But it could be much bigger. As local authorities become more relaxed about granting operators table dancing licences - under a catchily titled 'waiver of striptease rule'- the opportunities for clubs that can keep police forces on side and soothe the fears of nearby residents increase exponentially. The numbers being talked about are massive. As ever, the US provides the paradigm for the UK. </p> <p>'The industry will grow as it takes in more of the general public,' said Glenn Nicie, director of operations at FYEO. 'In the US, a little town will have five or six clubs. In Manhattan alone there are 700 table dancing clubs.' </p> <p>So bright does FYEO consider the future that it recently spent \u00a32m on building another club in Mayfair, due to open next month. The company is also looking to open venues in Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle. </p> <p>So if it's such a growth area, why did SFI group, the leisure company that owns bar brands such as the Slug &amp; Lettuce, the Litten Tree and Bar Med, announce last month that it wanted to offload the FYEO chain, which has clubs in Bournemouth and Southampton as well as in London? </p> <p>It seems to make no sense. After all, an ordinary pub would make around \u00a3250,000 a year - a fraction of the profit at a table dancing venue. And it's not hard to work out why. A punter in a boozer may spend \u00a330 on drinks in an evening, compared with \u00a3150 in a dancing club. </p> <p>The decision to spin off the clubs is all to do with focus, apparently. 'We talked with the SFI board long and hard, and decided we needed a separate management structure to look after the table-dancing side,' Nicie says, adding, without irony that you've 'got to stay close to it'. </p> <p>Indeed. There have been several spectacular failures in recent years which have put potential investors off the industry at a time when it is desperate for cash to expand. </p> <p>First, there was the collapse of the Ofex-listed Berkeley Playhouse, which sucked in nearly \u00a33m from investors, thanks largely to enthusiastic support from City types who liked to unwind there after a hard day crunching numbers. It opened with the backing of former 'page three stunna' Jilly Johnson in October 1997. By the following March it had debts believed to be as much as \u00a32m. </p> <p>This was hardly surprising. The club was practically stillborn. The Playhouse hadn't reckoned with the might of Westminster council and opened before it had a licence. The result? Its girls were dancing with their clothes on half the time. </p> <p>When the management persuaded the dancers to wear see-through underwear they were pounced on by undercover Westminster inspectors. Admittedly this was after the diligent inspectors had witnessed no less than eight different performances, obviously in an attempt to gauge accurately the true scale of the Playhouse's perversity. </p> <p>But the contempt in which the Playhouse held its shareholders was nothing compared with how Cherokee Leisure treated its investors. The company, like Berkeley an Ofex-listed venue, went belly-up in October 1999 with debts of more than \u00a31.5m. Several of the firm's clubs repeatedly fell foul of the licensing laws. One magistrate said it had a 'cavalier disregard for basic standards that would disgrace a corner shop takeaway, let alone a public limited company'. </p> <p>Cherokee denied this, arguing that it had always acted in the interests of its shareholders. It's hard to see how. First, Cherokee had the insane idea of launching a 'babes on the green' caddy service, whereby nubile women would accompany golfers around the fairway, offering them advice on what to do with their mashie niblicks. </p> <p>Then there was the inspired idea of riding the dotcom boom by investing what was purported to be \u00a3800,000 in a failed internet venture so that the clubs' delights could be viewed online. </p> <p>Not content with all this, the company decided it would be a brilliant idea to buy a chain of fitness clubs. It approached Fitstop, launched by former Olympic athlete Sally Gunnell. Cherokee managing director David Peters argued that the deal made strategic sense. 'People who work out also go table dancing,' Peters told an incredulous City. </p> <p>To top it all, his firm failed to understand the most important rules of the table-dancing industry: don't make your clubs exclusive and do pick the right locations. But Cherokee's were for members only. It opened clubs in such salubrious places as Watford. And even those in more prestigious locations such as London's Tower Bridge area had to close at 11pm, completely missing the after-pub trade. </p> <p>Given the industry's seedy reputation and its apparent lack of fiduciary responsibility, big operators such as FYEO and Stringfellows are now grappling with a conundrum. By their estimates the industry is ripe for growth. They want to go to the City to raise the funds to expand. 'The way forward is the plc route,' says Peter Stringfellow, who wants to launch clubs in Birmingham, Manchester and Paris. 'The City has to take notice of this business. Soon there will be a number of plcs in this industry.' </p> <p>But although Square Mile types may like the clubs for corporate hospitality, they no longer want to invest in them, having had their fingers burnt already. 'Wherever there are high profits there are risks,' Nicie concedes. </p> <p>Which is why the remaining UK operators fear the US invasion. The big US and Canadian operators, some of whom have more than 20 years' experience at running table dancing clubs, are now looking to muscle in on this side of the Atlantic, where they foresee huge opportunities. </p> <p>Already the bafflingly named Spearmint Rhino, which with 31 US clubs, 3,500 employees and a turnover of $60m, is one of the industry's biggest groups, has launched its first club in central London. The founder, former policeman John Gray, who started the business when he was 18, wants to open another 20 UK lap dancing venues. </p> <p>Gray has been withering about his UK rivals. He claims to have girls working in several London clubs 'gathering information' and boasts that soon all the best dancers will be working for him. He argues that the UK industry lacks sophistication and that his clubs, which are heavy on the gold leaf and the velvet wallpaper, will add a 'more theatrical' element. Other US clubs will arrive soon, according to Stringfellow. </p> <p>This invasion could hurt UK operators looking for cash to expand, and some in the British industry argue that it will hurt the image they have established. The US operators offer full nudity and are much more explicit than their UK counterparts. At the back of Spearmint Rhino's club in London, there are booths where clients pay for private 'full contact' lap dancing sessions. </p> <p>An indignant Stringfellow says: 'This industry is in its infancy. It's got to be kept respectable. I'm concerned about the influx of new operators coming in ignoring all sorts of rules.' </p> <p>Whatever happens, the explosion of clubs means there are likely to be thousands more Debbies in the future. When the For Your Eyes Only chain advertised for dancers for its new Mayfair club a few month ago, it received 180 replies. Nicie says: 'More than 120 of them had never danced before. I thought \"Jesus, I'm going to have to set up a training school\".' </p> <p><strong>Your private dancer</strong></p> <p> Table dancing, or to give it its proper title, 'table-side' dancing, is a relatively recent phenomenon in the UK, arriving in 1995.

      "body": "<b>Day 1 </b> <br>On a grey, wet and cold afternoon, Ellen MacArthur visits every skipper on the dockside, one by one, before the race starts. An incredibly strong bond exists between the 24 solo skippers. Thousands of people line the walls at Les Sables d'Olonne, waving and cheering, 'ELL-EN, ELL-EN' as she crosses the start line at 16:11. Her long-held dream to compete in this pinnacle of ocean sailing, becomes reality. <p>It was pretty amazing for me - the emotion of leaving the dock and seeing all the people wave me off down the channel. It finally hit me during the night as I was working on the computer: This is it - I'm doing the Vend\u00e9e Globe. It hadn't really sunk in until then. So I'd better get on with it...</p> <p><b>Day 3</b> <br>Fleet approaching Spanish coast.</p> <p>Spoke to my uncle [a GP] today, to ask him if I should stick a burning hot wire through my fingernail to release a bit of pressure as it was black after I trapped it while trying to open a ballast valve last night. The answer was yes. The blood spurted out, leaving a still sore but less painfully throbbing finger.</p> <p>I'm not totally happy with the boat speed. I guess this is partly due to the extra weight of what I'm carrying for the next three months.</p> <p><b>Day 4</b><br> Steep, savage seas, with 45-knot blasts right on the Cape of NW Spain. Last night was the toughest I've spent on board. The wind went from 15 to 45 knots in 30 seconds. The seas were just horrific, I couldn't stop her leaping over each wave and crashing down on to the next. At one point, the carbon shelving on which the stores are stacked collapsed. Very tired.</p> <p><b>Day 7/8</b><br> Belgian skipper Patrick de Radigues out of race after being knocked unconscious during a gybe. His boat sails under pilot on to a Portuguese beach - but he is safe and OK. Trouble for Ellen, too: a sail destroyed. Next day Kingfisher passes through the race's Canary Islands 'gate'- the first turning point and leaderboard. Michel Desjoyeaux in PRB leads, followed by Yves Parlier (Aquitaine). Kingfisher is chasing Marc Thiercelin (Active Wear).</p> <p>At sunrise he crossed a mile to the west of me and I thought I had him... but he gybed back, about two miles ahead and I thought he had got away. But Adventurer just came over to film and told me that I was third. Yippee! </p> <p><b>Day 10 </b><br> Very fast average speeds for all leading boats as they charge south. Estimated four days to the Doldrums.</p> <p>What a day! It has been a sleigh ride, non-stop surfing averaging more than 15 knots. I spent at least four hours helming - it's an amazing feeling, like being pushed over the top of a hill on a brakeless bike. The kettle's on. Time to go. The paella should be rehydrated by now.</p> <p><b>Day 11</b> <br> Most of her rivals eat the flying fish that wipe themselves out on the boats - but Ellen is concerned about them.</p> <p>I can't let them die flapping on the deck, I have to throw them back in. As there are dozens of them, it's quite time-consuming.</p> <p><b>Day 13 </b> <br> Feeling sore.</p> <p>I feel well, though my hands are covered in tiny, but incredibly sore little salt sores. The hotter weather is not helping. They need to stay dry and cool - impossible factors on a 60ft baking oven.</p> <p><b>Day 15</b> <br> Doldrums takes a grip.</p> <p>Just seen the most astonishing thing - a satellite I guess - coming hurtling down to earth. But I can't think anyone has sailed more slowly than us in the past six hours.</p> <p><b>Day 16</b> <br> Leader Parlier crossed the equator yesterday.</p> <p>I crossed the equator at 01:25 GMT - celebrated with a bottle of champagne, most of it went on the boat not me - on purpose. I thanked Neptune for letting us pass, and prayed that all the other boats passed safely in both directions.</p> <p><b>Day 20</b> <br> Leading pack continue to charge south, 800 miles east of Rio.</p> <p>After 20 days at sea, I notice we have covered over one fifth of the course. It is a very fast pace. I believe this race will be won by the most reliable boat, the one that can push enough, just for long enough - but still keep things together.</p> <p><b>Day 21 </b><br> Gymnastics up the mast.</p> <p>I went for the rig check, which involves climbing the mast, and checking over everything up there before we plunge into the Southern Ocean. It's not easy alone, as the boat never wants to sit still, and there's no one to winch you up, nor ease you down. That's the hardest part of the exercise.</p> <p>We have a jumar arrangement, like climbers, where as I climb it goes up with me so I'm always attached - then a separate one I ease down with me (not so easy!). On the first attempt I discovered a problem with the genoa stay, which meant I had to go back up - already bruised, I was bit annoyed. When I was up there the wind picked up as I was on my way down. I could have walked down the mainsail if it had been windier. </p> <p>Once on deck I furled the genoa, and unfurled the solent - and prepared my tools for the second ascent. All was well - the boat a bit more stable - till I realised when about to go down that I'd left the second jumar in the cuddy. Bugger. Oh well, like the old clipper crews I scaled down the mast, stopping to re-do the solent stay on the way down.</p> <p><b>Day 26</b> <br> Drama as kite gives way.</p> <p>There are always down moments and this is one of them. First off I noticed some chafe, which I knew I had to sort sooner rather than later, so I set to reinforcing and protecting the problem area. I made 720 bradawl holes and 720 stitches by hand and sorted out the tack problem. It was six hours of hard work, and my hands were really sore afterwards, but it was a success. </p> <p>Then, when we were off and going well, suddenly the kite gave way and went under the boat and in the water. I had to stop and haul my biggest sail back in, untangle it from the bowsprit and everywhere else until I finally had a pile of wet cloth on the foredeck. Repair's fine - when I get a chance to dry the whole thing out, I'll be able to see what the problem was. Once I had the gennaker back up I went down and just collapsed on the chart table seat and had a bit of a cry - but it was only because I was so tired. </p> <p> <b>Day 29 </b> <br>I went partying last night!</p> <p>A good night. The sea temperature is now down to three Celcius and when on deck you can really feel the cold coming off it. I am getting very layered up now with the fleeces and linings and I wear a hat at all times. I went partying last night with the Royal Ocean Racing Club at their Christmas dinner. I phoned up and it was so fantastic to hear the 350 sailors there whooping and cheering at me down the line as I scooted along at up to 25 knots and then made loads of noise when we said goodbye. It was great, this is great. I am where I want to be. This is my dream. Thanks everybody!</p> <p><b>Day 30 </b> <br> Icebergs - a close call for Kingfisher.</p> <p>I awoke with a start from a short nap. I looked out of the window in the cabin and there it was - an iceberg right by the boat. Within seconds I was on deck, and we passed within 15 to 20 metres of the berg, actually sailing through the white water next to it. All I could think of was what would have happened if we had hit it. The radar was alarmed, but as is sometimes the case, this berg was invisible to it, even when I was right next to it.</p> <p><b>Day 31</b> <br>Champagne again. Kingfisher passes the longitude of Cape of Good Hope - a quick sip from a bottle of champagne to celebrate. PRB retakes second place from Sill. Kingfisher is fourth. Feeling a bit achy and tired this morning, not sure why. It's cold, but I've got used to it. If I'm chilly, I just get on deck and start trimming the mainsheet with the winch grinder. I get to warm up and the boat goes surfing faster - perfect.</p> <p><b>Day 32</b><br> All change. Michel Desjoyeaux and PRB take the lead, with Sill in company. Parlier (Aquitaine) is becalmed in his very southerly position. Kingfisher slips to sixth place. Dominique Wavre smashes the 24-hour record just days after it was set by Yves Parlier, recording just under 430 miles in 24 hours.</p> <p>A month ago losing a couple of places like that in the official list would have really stressed me. But now I have a much better perspective, and the Southern Ocean. I'm racing my race, definitely noting what is happening around me, but taking care of my boat and me before anything else.</p> <p>Waves coming from all directions. It's amazing, we just pick up a wave, accelerate, gets faster and faster and just keeps on going. </p> <p><b>Day 36</b> <br>Company alongside.</p> <p>It's very strange when you're thousands of miles from anywhere to suddenly see another boat. Yesterday, at first light, there was Toma Coville (Sodebo) alongside. He's been there all day, and I have to admit I'd rather be physically alone. It's different when it's the albatrosses. Feeling stressed.</p> <p><b>Day 38</b> <br> Ellen cries herself to sleep.</p> <p>I really screwed up yesterday, I misread my notes and waited too long for the pressure to drop before gybing. Stupid fool - I was so p***** off I cried myself to sleep in my bunk, for the first time. So angry during night that I put up the genoa in 35 knots. Fast if nothing else... now blowing 40... time to roll it up!</p> <p><b>Day 39</b> <br> The closest to death I have come.</p> <p>As I sit here now I feel worse than I have ever felt in my life. Physically I am totally exhausted, and mentally - not so far off. My whole body aches. My mind feels like it's been frozen. Yesterday was the hardest challenge of my life, though this morning feels 10 times worse.</p> <p>It started when the tack of the staysail blew off. I dropped the halyard immediately and went on to the foredeck to sort out the mess, not easy in 45 knots. It was then that she started to go - to gybe, and before I could make it back to the cockpit her deck was vertical, and we were lying helplessly on our side. A fairly bad situation to be in - but what was to come was far worse.</p> <p>I realised that I couldn't get the mainsail down to fix a problem with one of the battens, which had broken. Neither love, money nor the best will in the world was going to let me lower that sail without going up there to remove the batten. Going up the rig in 40 knots plus just doesn't bear thinking about.</p> <p>It was bitterly cold, the biting wind cutting into the bare skin on my hands and face. The first part, to the first spreader, was OK because I still had energy - but to the second spreader was 10 times harder with each inch I climbed. I was beginning to tire, as each wave we surfed on (about 10 meters high) was trying to throw me off. The last 2ft to the second spreader were the hardest 2ft of my life.</p> <p>I struggled to inch my way up, and hung there a while banging away at the mast trying to recover. I found the energy from I don't know where, and made it on to the spreader. </p> <p>You'd think getting down was the easy bit - but it took me closer to the edge than I wished to go. Each few inches I descended I had to take my weight with my hands, or legs, which proved exhausting. I arrived at one point with all my weight on my right wrist in one of the webbing loops on the sail. I hung there, banging into the mast, trying desperately, and unsuccessfully, to get my foot through the gap between the sail and the mast. I started to hurt badly. It took over an hour to get down - just 15 metres. I barely had the energy to put the sail back up again, then collapsed in the cockpit. As I dashed about working, my vision went funny - I was seeing stars permanently, as if I was about to black out.</p> <p>This morning was worse. I saw a rip in the genoa, along the foot. I tried to fix it. It was impossible. Even with the sail sheeted hard behind the main it flapped and flicked in my face, and ripped out the stitching I was trying to put in. </p> <p>After trying to fix that sail I was at my lowest point in the race. I cried out loud to the heavens. I am losing miles because of a stupid tear in a sail. So frustrating. I can't sleep, or switch off.</p> <p><b>Day 40</b> <br>The world's a better place.</p> <p>Ached a lot when I woke this morning, but life is considerably better than 24 hours ago. I had to slow down for three hours to repair the genoa, but it's done - getting it fixed, at least for now, has done great things for my morale. </p> <p><b>Day 42 </b> <br> Kingfisher lies third after the dismasting, a day earlier, of Yves Parlier. He is OK does not need assistance from Ellen - who is finding life hard.</p> <p>I'm constantly on edge: I think the big winds are still 24 hours away. The guys farther back in the fleet have been experiencing 60-plus knots, so I know it's going to be a rough Christmas this year. </p> <p><b>Day 46</b><br> Damaged, exhausted\u0085 new limits.</p> <p>I extended my limit. I'm battered, bruised and exhausted. A lost sail, a broken halyard, four hours at top of a mast to fix it. My forearms are shaking. Why? Why now? Why do this to me?</p> <p>The mainsail has to come down, then it's back up with it, with the last reserves of energy. Unfurl the genoa. Grind and grind on the pedestal to get it trimmed - 150sqm of sail powering up the boat again. Drag the remnants of the lost sail, soaked in freezing water, down the fore-hatch - to the sail graveyard. But it's not over\u0085 </p> <p>The same halyard that holds the Code 5 sail up is used for the only other downwind sail she has left - the gennaker. What's left of the broken halyard is at the top of the mast and on the deck - with nothing in between. The only solution is to free climb the 25-metre mast, to twice the height of the same death-defying climb of a week ago, and make the repairs, then a painful descent. </p> <p><b>Day 47 - Christmas Day!</b> <br> Team office closed, Ellen and boat still open for business. She had more than 70 different people ring her to wish her well during a conference call.</p> <p><b>Day 50 </b> <br>Third-placed Ellen sails into the immense Pacific - albeit the Southern Ocean part, one of the world's most isolated regions. Next land that the skippers will hope to see will be Cape Horn.</p> <p>I've never seen squalls quite so violent ... in just over 24 hours' time we shall be on the same longitude as Auckland [where she was built]. I think Kingfisher is feeling she's close to home.</p> <p><b>Day 53</b> <br> PRB had a 112-mile lead from Sill with Kingfisher, third, forced off to the south.</p> <p>I feel quite low now\u0085 this is the hardest part for me - putting us in the right place. The worry, the constant fretting - the hours staring at a computer screen analysing and reanalysing till you are blue in the face. Guess this is what I lack - the experience. The experience of standing by a decision, and understanding it in a way different to I do now.</p> <p><b>Day 54</b> <br> Tears on New Year's Day.</p> <p>Not the best of New Years. I've never cried so much in my life. I'm really not sure why I've been feeling so low. I'm very tired, and maybe I've not realised how much the past 50 days have taken out of me. This morning I lay in the cockpit and just cried for two hours. I've never done that in my life before, not like this... I don't seem to be able to sleep, and that of course is making it worse. I certainly miss my family and friends but I don't feel lonely.</p> <p><b>Day 56</b><br> Ellen's most testing time. Ten icebergs in one day.</p> <p>Never in my life before have I experienced such beauty, and fear at the same time - 10 icebergs so far today. They have ranged from 200ft in length, to about half a mile. The first was not a surprise, the second neither really - but when the third, fourth, fifth and sixth all appeared in a line with just a mile between them I was bewildered at their frequency. I wanted to gybe north, but ended up hand steering to pass three of the bergs to windward. I gybed between the fifth and sixth only to see the next two - the seventh being the most enormous of all...</p> <p>I was forced to hand steer to pass the seventh. It was enormous, and for a while I didn't think we'd make it to windward as the wind rose to 30 knots. We made it and I was then faced with the most beautiful iceberg I could imagine. Wide, blue, high-arched caves, and a height that must have been similar to the white cliffs of Dover. So quiet, apart from the waves breaking about its base. High faces of pure white harshly disfigured by deep blue cracks roughly cut from above.</p> <p>Every 10 minutes I stick my head out and look. Every time I dodge the flying freezing spray - squinting at the horizon till my eyes sting with the cold. I'd just made a cup of tea to try to thaw out when I thought I 'd have a last check. Of course there was a berg - stayed up there for half an hour... freezing cold, but eyes glued to the water for growlers (small pieces of ice that break off the main berg). Several times, despite trying to duck, the visor of my jacket is pounded by the waves. Frozen eyelids again.</p> <p><b>Day 58</b> <br>Kingfisher moves into second place. </p> <p>Sailed yesterday under-canvassed. I should have had the reef out, but I know it was time to rest more than I have been doing. I have to build up my reserves. As a result of Sill's problems with the broken gennaker halyard, Kingfisher has managed to move into second place.</p> <p><b>Day 62</b> <br> Big trouble for Kingfisher with PRB 500 miles ahead when the gennaker halyard breaks for the second time.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it\u0085 suddenly the boat slowed and I just knew what had happened - once again my body feels like it has been dislocated in a dozen places. I had to work out the best plan to save the sail - at least when we were stopped we bought some time. As I stumbled across Kingfisher's rolling deck, seeing her sails down, I could not help but feel she resembled a wounded bird. I felt for her. I fought for an hour and a half to get it back on deck - on further hauling huge rips were present... My heart sank... again up the mast, and a repair that I'm not even sure is possible. </p> <p><b>Day 66</b> <br> After a time going slow without the halyard, Kingfisher is back on track and Ellen finally passes the Cape two days and 17 hours inside Christophe Auguin's record pace from the 1996 event - and just over two days behind the race leader Michel Desjoyeaux.</p> <p>I feel overwhelmed. The stress and difficulties of the last few days seem to be melting into emotion as I approach the Horn. The second time for Kingfisher and me together. It's a great symbol for the two of us personally, as the very first time I was ever alone on her, was just a few miles from this famous rock.</p> <p>I cannot help but feel moved deep inside. The thoughts of the past storms and struggles are far off at this point. This race has been hard, but when I think of those here hundreds of years ago I feel very humble sitting here in my hi-tech wet-weather kit. For them, the corner was literally life or death. My heart goes out to all those who have struggled, survived and died on this piece of water.</p> <p>It's been a long haul since the launch in NZ, and the most incredible adventure of my life. It's far more than just the story of a girl alone at sea. For me it's a story of teamwork, friendship and love. The story of so many people working towards a goal, and if not working, willing us on... I feel there are so many others with me on board. I've never been lonely - far from it. <br> <b>Day 72</b> <br> A low-pressure area forming between two highs, will bring back the South American cold front - who will gain most?</p> <p>If I run the routing software for all the [leading] boats it suggests we'll all be at a similar latitude in a few days... I've been having amazing dreams for much of the race. Yesterday I dreamt Richard Branson was on board, but I've no idea why. If someone could find out whether he likes milk in his coffee, and how much, that would be great - I'd love to know if my dream was factually correct or not!</p> <p><b>Day 75</b> <br>Ellen closing in on PRB. The pressure is rising, in more ways than one... Kingfisher this morning is positioned just 50 miles to the south of PRB and still 200 miles to the west. Behind Ellen, Active Wear has closed to less than 200 miles.</p> <p>This morning feels like a new start. It's incredible... we've had little wind - and now, thank goodness, it seems in 36 hours we might be able to tack [signalling entry to the SE trade winds, to the north of the St Helena high-pressure system - the 'hole' that has been blocking the route of PRB for days now]. It's a constant job of looking at tacking, trimming, keeping going. Frustrating - we need new winds.</p> <p><b>Day 79</b><br> Kingfisher and PRB head for Doldrums. The mast-climbing is back. During the night Ellen's wind instruments failed (they work from a 'wand' at the top of the mast). A two-hour climb to top of the mast, drill and sandpaper in hand, and the DIY Queen of the Seas had it fixed.</p> <p>A day of varied winds and many sail changes. The temperature has increased further, and sleeping, especially during the day, is difficult. Despite exhaustion it is well worthwhile as Kingfisher is once again crossing the waves at her full potential... a great feeling.</p> <p><b>Day 80</b><br> Tough in the Atlantic, less than 300 miles from the Equator... almost too late to choose another position to cross. </p> <p>I've been hand-steering all night, the replacement wind instrument wand wasn't working properly... I've been preparing mentally for another climb. I'm tired, but now it's light I have to go and sort it out [which she then does].</p> <p>I'm totally exhausted, my leg is black from the bruises, I've got scratches and holes all over me. It was brutal. Once I got to the top a rain squall came over, the boat half-gybed on its own seven times. The wind was all over the place. The only way I could get her back the final time was to try to flick the top of the mainsail over with my body so the wind would fill on the right side again... I just want to cry.</p> <p><b>Day 81</b><br> Back in the Northern Hemisphere - and just 26 miles behind PRB! Ellen's third crossing of the equator in 10 months. </p> <p>My body still aches quite badly and I definitely need to get more sleep. Mich not surprisingly took a few miles on me yesterday during the day, but while I was sleeping immediately after coming down from the mast, I was heading further east than before as I just left the genoa up, and so we've closed on longitude [east/west separation], which I didn't actually want to do. He has, of course, not left me much room for manoeuvre. As he hit the calms I was still going great but I know that whoever gets away first is going to stack the miles on. </p> <p><b>Day 82</b> <br> Kingfisher ranked first! Ellen sailed to the top of the ranking during the night. The 03:00 positions put her three miles ahead, although nine miles to the south and further east than PRB - in the battle to exit the Doldrums.</p> <p>Mich and I are suffering here, we've done just 65 miles in 24 hours, it's desperate. I am very, very tired, having entered the Doldrums quite exhausted after climbing the mast... that wasn't the best way to start this battle with the calms. I guess I had no choice. Mich and I are very stuck. This is exhausting.</p> <p><b>Day 83</b> <br> PRB touched the Trade Winds about 10 hours before Ellen and managed to get away to the north and west - now holding a 46-mile lead.</p> <p>Once I lost my westerly position I never had the opportunity to get back there. I'm still kicking myself for my mistake three days ago when I fell asleep after climbing the mast, and let the boat head farther east. I always wanted to be west, but that moment of fatigue lost me that advantage... I can't help thinking where I would be if I'd held that more westerly position going in to the calms.</p> <p><b>Day 84/85</b><br> The long route north. PRB, Kingfisher, Sill and Active Wear are possibly - for the first time in a month - all sailing in basically the same conditions. Then disaster (or something) strikes\u0085 Kingfisher is damaged when she sails in to a solid object, suspected to be a semi-submerged container. She's left 79 miles behind PRB; 2,438 miles to go to finish for Ellen.</p> <p>All of a sudden there was the most almighty crunching sound and the boat felt like she had hit land. As I glanced behind to see what I had hit I saw part of the rudder and the daggerboard floating away. It was a gut-wrenching moment. I immediately ran through the boat, checking in all the watertight compartments that there was no water in there. There was obviously a big risk of having ripped the bottom of the boat open. The hull was fine, and it appeared that it was just the appendages [daggerboard, rudder] that were damaged... I will just try to do the best that I can. I promised that... could I still catch PRB? Big question. Anything can happen, absolutely anything can happen.</p> <p><b>Day 87</b> <br>PRB slows as 'pressure' rises again. After four days of relatively steady sailing upwind in the Trades, PRB has started to feel the effects of the high-pressure system that blocks the route of the leaders. Ellen is 90 miles to his south and 40 miles east.</p> <p>This next 48 hours are going to be decisive. It's the last chance for anyone to pass I think. We seem to have been keeping our distance on third-placed Bilou\u0085 I'm sailing a bit closer to the wind and accepting some speed loss, so at least I'm not just following Mich's tracks.</p> <p><b>Day 89</b> <br> PRB extends lead as storm approaches. Where are they? They are now to the west of Madeira, heading towards Cape Finisterre, the final landmark before the finish at Les Sables d'Olonne. Annoying to see how far Mich has got away... I have a cargo ship near me, but I haven't been able to see it at all, so I have to keep a constant lookout for it. I know he's there from the Active Echo radar detector, but I don't know where exactly. Not very relaxing.</p> <p><b>Day 91 </b> <br> It's 7 February. Rough but Kingfisher is holding position. After one of the toughest 24 hours for Ellen, she is mentally exhausted. Sill is still trapped by lighter winds and is now at 400 miles from Kingfisher, and Activewear is even farther back at 900 from PRB.</p> <p>I'm on a new chart - even better, I'm nearly a third of the way up the chart towards Les Sables. Got to go - looks like my lashing on the radar, broken during the daggerboard removal exercise has come loose\u0085 the radar is hanging down - got to try to save it.</p> <p><b>Day 93</b> <br> Near disaster on the final lap - the genoa forestay main rigging holding the mast foreward fails. Ellen breaks a 36-hour silence on mishap.</p> <p>I didn't want to give Mich a reason to ease off, he could equally suffer gear failure if he pushes... and I didn't want to give Bilou a reason to attack harder. My heading and speed have dropped away compared with Mich, I decided it was time to share this bad news. I now have to focus on finishing in the top three - it's been a difficult 10 days. I'm ready to finish.</p> <p><b>Day 94</b> <br> Patched Kingfisher second - end in sight.</p> <p>The wind has switched more south-west so although I'm sailing at a good speed of 13 to 15 knots, I'm making only 11 towards the finish. I look at the repair of the gennaker and pray - I'm surprised that it has lasted this long. Had the weirdest dream last night: we were all doing the Vend\u00e9e Globe on bicycles! Don't ask me what I'm doing next after this race... congratulations to Mich. </p> <p>\u0095 Adapted from material provided by Mark Turner of Offshore Challenges.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/sport/story/0,6903,436547,00.html\">She won everything, except the race</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/sport/story/0,6903,436530,00.html\">Le Professeur teaches the world to sail along</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.ellenmacarthur.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Ellen MacArthur's site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.kingfisherchallenges.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Kingfisher Challenges</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Day 1 On a grey, wet and cold afternoon, Ellen MacArthur visits every skipper on the dockside, one by one, before the race starts. An incredibly strong bond exists between the 24 solo skippers. Thousands of people line the walls at Les Sables d'Olonne, waving and cheering, 'ELL-EN, ELL-EN' as she crosses the start line at 16:11. Her long-held dream to compete in this pinnacle of ocean sailing, becomes reality. It was pretty amazing for me - the emotion of leaving the dock and seeing all the people wave me off down the channel. It finally hit me during the night as I was working on the computer: This is it - I'm doing the Vend\u00e9e Globe. It hadn't really sunk in until then. So I'd better get on with it... Day 3 Fleet approaching Spanish coast. Spoke to my uncle [a GP] today, to ask him if I should stick a burning hot wire through my fingernail to release a bit of pressure as it was black after I trapped it while trying to open a ballast valve last night. The answer was yes. The blood spurted out, leaving a still sore but less painfully throbbing finger. I'm not totally happy with the boat speed. I guess this is partly due to the extra weight of what I'm carrying for the next three months. Day 4 Steep, savage seas, with 45-knot blasts right on the Cape of NW Spain. Last night was the toughest I've spent on board. The wind went from 15 to 45 knots in 30 seconds. The seas were just horrific, I couldn't stop her leaping over each wave and crashing down on to the next. At one point, the carbon shelving on which the stores are stacked collapsed. Very tired. Day 7/8 Belgian skipper Patrick de Radigues out of race after being knocked unconscious during a gybe. His boat sails under pilot on to a Portuguese beach - but he is safe and OK. Trouble for Ellen, too: a sail destroyed. Next day Kingfisher passes through the race's Canary Islands 'gate'- the first turning point and leaderboard. Michel Desjoyeaux in PRB leads, followed by Yves Parlier (Aquitaine). Kingfisher is chasing Marc Thiercelin (Active Wear). At sunrise he crossed a mile to the west of me and I thought I had him... but he gybed back, about two miles ahead and I thought he had got away. But Adventurer just came over to film and told me that I was third. Yippee! Day 10 Very fast average speeds for all leading boats as they charge south. Estimated four days to the Doldrums. What a day! It has been a sleigh ride, non-stop surfing averaging more than 15 knots. I spent at least four hours helming - it's an amazing feeling, like being pushed over the top of a hill on a brakeless bike. The kettle's on. Time to go. The paella should be rehydrated by now. Day 11 Most of her rivals eat the flying fish that wipe themselves out on the boats - but Ellen is concerned about them. I can't let them die flapping on the deck, I have to throw them back in. As there are dozens of them, it's quite time-consuming. Day 13 Feeling sore. I feel well, though my hands are covered in tiny, but incredibly sore little salt sores. The hotter weather is not helping. They need to stay dry and cool - impossible factors on a 60ft baking oven. Day 15 Doldrums takes a grip. Just seen the most astonishing thing - a satellite I guess - coming hurtling down to earth. But I can't think anyone has sailed more slowly than us in the past six hours. Day 16 Leader Parlier crossed the equator yesterday. I crossed the equator at 01:25 GMT - celebrated with a bottle of champagne, most of it went on the boat not me - on purpose. I thanked Neptune for letting us pass, and prayed that all the other boats passed safely in both directions. Day 20 Leading pack continue to charge south, 800 miles east of Rio. After 20 days at sea, I notice we have covered over one fifth of the course. It is a very fast pace. I believe this race will be won by the most reliable boat, the one that can push enough, just for long enough - but still keep things together. Day 21 Gymnastics up the mast. I went for the rig check, which involves climbing the mast, and checking over everything up there before we plunge into the Southern Ocean. It's not easy alone, as the boat never wants to sit still, and there's no one to winch you up, nor ease you down. That's the hardest part of the exercise. We have a jumar arrangement, like climbers, where as I climb it goes up with me so I'm always attached - then a separate one I ease down with me (not so easy!). On the first attempt I discovered a problem with the genoa stay, which meant I had to go back up - already bruised, I was bit annoyed. When I was up there the wind picked up as I was on my way down. I could have walked down the mainsail if it had been windier. Once on deck I furled the genoa, and unfurled the solent - and prepared my tools for the second ascent. All was well - the boat a bit more stable - till I realised when about to go down that I'd left the second jumar in the cuddy. Bugger. Oh well, like the old clipper crews I scaled down the mast, stopping to re-do the solent stay on the way down. Day 26 Drama as kite gives way. There are always down moments and this is one of them. First off I noticed some chafe, which I knew I had to sort sooner rather than later, so I set to reinforcing and protecting the problem area. I made 720 bradawl holes and 720 stitches by hand and sorted out the tack problem. It was six hours of hard work, and my hands were really sore afterwards, but it was a success. Then, when we were off and going well, suddenly the kite gave way and went under the boat and in the water. I had to stop and haul my biggest sail back in, untangle it from the bowsprit and everywhere else until I finally had a pile of wet cloth on the foredeck. Repair's fine - when I get a chance to dry the whole thing out, I'll be able to see what the problem was. Once I had the gennaker back up I went down and just collapsed on the chart table seat and had a bit of a cry - but it was only because I was so tired. Day 29 I went partying last night! A good night. The sea temperature is now down to three Celcius and when on deck you can really feel the cold coming off it. I am getting very layered up now with the fleeces and linings and I wear a hat at all times. I went partying last night with the Royal Ocean Racing Club at their Christmas dinner. I phoned up and it was so fantastic to hear the 350 sailors there whooping and cheering at me down the line as I scooted along at up to 25 knots and then made loads of noise when we said goodbye. It was great, this is great. I am where I want to be. This is my dream. Thanks everybody! Day 30 Icebergs - a close call for Kingfisher. I awoke with a start from a short nap. I looked out of the window in the cabin and there it was - an iceberg right by the boat. Within seconds I was on deck, and we passed within 15 to 20 metres of the berg, actually sailing through the white water next to it. All I could think of was what would have happened if we had hit it. The radar was alarmed, but as is sometimes the case, this berg was invisible to it, even when I was right next to it. Day 31 Champagne again. Kingfisher passes the longitude of Cape of Good Hope - a quick sip from a bottle of champagne to celebrate. PRB retakes second place from Sill. Kingfisher is fourth. Feeling a bit achy and tired this morning, not sure why. It's cold, but I've got used to it. If I'm chilly, I just get on deck and start trimming the mainsheet with the winch grinder. I get to warm up and the boat goes surfing faster - perfect. Day 32 All change. Michel Desjoyeaux and PRB take the lead, with Sill in company. Parlier (Aquitaine) is becalmed in his very southerly position. Kingfisher slips to sixth place. Dominique Wavre smashes the 24-hour record just days after it was set by Yves Parlier, recording just under 430 miles in 24 hours. A month ago losing a couple of places like that in the official list would have really stressed me. But now I have a much better perspective, and the Southern Ocean. I'm racing my race, definitely noting what is happening around me, but taking care of my boat and me before anything else. Waves coming from all directions. It's amazing, we just pick up a wave, accelerate, gets faster and faster and just keeps on going. Day 36 Company alongside. It's very strange when you're thousands of miles from anywhere to suddenly see another boat. Yesterday, at first light, there was Toma Coville (Sodebo) alongside. He's been there all day, and I have to admit I'd rather be physically alone. It's different when it's the albatrosses. Feeling stressed. Day 38 Ellen cries herself to sleep. I really screwed up yesterday, I misread my notes and waited too long for the pressure to drop before gybing. Stupid fool - I was so p***** off I cried myself to sleep in my bunk, for the first time. So angry during night that I put up the genoa in 35 knots. Fast if nothing else... now blowing 40... time to roll it up! Day 39 The closest to death I have come. As I sit here now I feel worse than I have ever felt in my life. Physically I am totally exhausted, and mentally - not so far off. My whole body aches. My mind feels like it's been frozen. Yesterday was the hardest challenge of my life, though this morning feels 10 times worse. It started when the tack of the staysail blew off. I dropped the halyard immediately and went on to the foredeck to sort out the mess, not easy in 45 knots. It was then that she started to go - to gybe, and before I could make it back to the cockpit her deck was vertical, and we were lying helplessly on our side. A fairly bad situation to be in - but what was to come was far worse. I realised that I couldn't get the mainsail down to fix a problem with one of the battens, which had broken. Neither love, money nor the best will in the world was going to let me lower that sail without going up there to remove the batten. Going up the rig in 40 knots plus just doesn't bear thinking about. It was bitterly cold, the biting wind cutting into the bare skin on my hands and face. The first part, to the first spreader, was OK because I still had energy - but to the second spreader was 10 times harder with each inch I climbed. I was beginning to tire, as each wave we surfed on (about 10 meters high) was trying to throw me off. The last 2ft to the second spreader were the hardest 2ft of my life. I struggled to inch my way up, and hung there a while banging away at the mast trying to recover. I found the energy from I don't know where, and made it on to the spreader. You'd think getting down was the easy bit - but it took me closer to the edge than I wished to go. Each few inches I descended I had to take my weight with my hands, or legs, which proved exhausting. I arrived at one point with all my weight on my right wrist in one of the webbing loops on the sail. I hung there, banging into the mast, trying desperately, and unsuccessfully, to get my foot through the gap between the sail and the mast. I started to hurt badly. It took over an hour to get down - just 15 metres. I barely had the energy to put the sail back up again, then collapsed in the cockpit. As I dashed about working, my vision went funny - I was seeing stars permanently, as if I was about to black out. This morning was worse. I saw a rip in the genoa, along the foot. I tried to fix it. It was impossible. Even with the sail sheeted hard behind the main it flapped and flicked in my face, and ripped out the stitching I was trying to put in. After trying to fix that sail I was at my lowest point in the race. I cried out loud to the heavens. I am losing miles because of a stupid tear in a sail. So frustrating. I can't sleep, or switch off. Day 40 The world's a better place. Ached a lot when I woke this morning, but life is considerably better than 24 hours ago. I had to slow down for three hours to repair the genoa, but it's done - getting it fixed, at least for now, has done great things for my morale. Day 42 Kingfisher lies third after the dismasting, a day earlier, of Yves Parlier. He is OK does not need assistance from Ellen - who is finding life hard. I'm constantly on edge: I think the big winds are still 24 hours away. The guys farther back in the fleet have been experiencing 60-plus knots, so I know it's going to be a rough Christmas this year. Day 46 Damaged, exhausted\u0085 new limits. I extended my limit. I'm battered, bruised and exhausted. A lost sail, a broken halyard, four hours at top of a mast to fix it. My forearms are shaking. Why? Why now? Why do this to me? The mainsail has to come down, then it's back up with it, with the last reserves of energy. Unfurl the genoa. Grind and grind on the pedestal to get it trimmed - 150sqm of sail powering up the boat again. Drag the remnants of the lost sail, soaked in freezing water, down the fore-hatch - to the sail graveyard. But it's not over\u0085 The same halyard that holds the Code 5 sail up is used for the only other downwind sail she has left - the gennaker. What's left of the broken halyard is at the top of the mast and on the deck - with nothing in between. The only solution is to free climb the 25-metre mast, to twice the height of the same death-defying climb of a week ago, and make the repairs, then a painful descent. Day 47 - Christmas Day! Team office closed, Ellen and boat still open for business. She had more than 70 different people ring her to wish her well during a conference call. Day 50 Third-placed Ellen sails into the immense Pacific - albeit the Southern Ocean part, one of the world's most isolated regions. Next land that the skippers will hope to see will be Cape Horn. I've never seen squalls quite so violent ... in just over 24 hours' time we shall be on the same longitude as Auckland [where she was built]. I think Kingfisher is feeling she's close to home. Day 53 PRB had a 112-mile lead from Sill with Kingfisher, third, forced off to the south. I feel quite low now\u0085 this is the hardest part for me - putting us in the right place. The worry, the constant fretting - the hours staring at a computer screen analysing and reanalysing till you are blue in the face. Guess this is what I lack - the experience. The experience of standing by a decision, and understanding it in a way different to I do now. Day 54 Tears on New Year's Day. Not the best of New Years. I've never cried so much in my life. I'm really not sure why I've been feeling so low. I'm very tired, and maybe I've not realised how much the past 50 days have taken out of me. This morning I lay in the cockpit and just cried for two hours. I've never done that in my life before, not like this... I don't seem to be able to sleep, and that of course is making it worse. I certainly miss my family and friends but I don't feel lonely. Day 56 Ellen's most testing time. Ten icebergs in one day. Never in my life before have I experienced such beauty, and fear at the same time - 10 icebergs so far today. They have ranged from 200ft in length, to about half a mile. The first was not a surprise, the second neither really - but when the third, fourth, fifth and sixth all appeared in a line with just a mile between them I was bewildered at their frequency. I wanted to gybe north, but ended up hand steering to pass three of the bergs to windward. I gybed between the fifth and sixth only to see the next two - the seventh being the most enormous of all... I was forced to hand steer to pass the seventh. It was enormous, and for a while I didn't think we'd make it to windward as the wind rose to 30 knots. We made it and I was then faced with the most beautiful iceberg I could imagine. Wide, blue, high-arched caves, and a height that must have been similar to the white cliffs of Dover. So quiet, apart from the waves breaking about its base. High faces of pure white harshly disfigured by deep blue cracks roughly cut from above. Every 10 minutes I stick my head out and look. Every time I dodge the flying freezing spray - squinting at the horizon till my eyes sting with the cold. I'd just made a cup of tea to try to thaw out when I thought I 'd have a last check. Of course there was a berg - stayed up there for half an hour... freezing cold, but eyes glued to the water for growlers (small pieces of ice that break off the main berg). Several times, despite trying to duck, the visor of my jacket is pounded by the waves. Frozen eyelids again. Day 58 Kingfisher moves into second place. Sailed yesterday under-canvassed. I should have had the reef out, but I know it was time to rest more than I have been doing. I have to build up my reserves. As a result of Sill's problems with the broken gennaker halyard, Kingfisher has managed to move into second place. Day 62 Big trouble for Kingfisher with PRB 500 miles ahead when the gennaker halyard breaks for the second time. I couldn't believe it\u0085 suddenly the boat slowed and I just knew what had happened - once again my body feels like it has been dislocated in a dozen places. I had to work out the best plan to save the sail - at least when we were stopped we bought some time. As I stumbled across Kingfisher's rolling deck, seeing her sails down, I could not help but feel she resembled a wounded bird. I felt for her. I fought for an hour and a half to get it back on deck - on further hauling huge rips were present... My heart sank... again up the mast, and a repair that I'm not even sure is possible. Day 66 After a time going slow without the halyard, Kingfisher is back on track and Ellen finally passes the Cape two days and 17 hours inside Christophe Auguin's record pace from the 1996 event - and just over two days behind the race leader Michel Desjoyeaux. I feel overwhelmed. The stress and difficulties of the last few days seem to be melting into emotion as I approach the Horn. The second time for Kingfisher and me together. It's a great symbol for the two of us personally, as the very first time I was ever alone on her, was just a few miles from this famous rock. I cannot help but feel moved deep inside. The thoughts of the past storms and struggles are far off at this point. This race has been hard, but when I think of those here hundreds of years ago I feel very humble sitting here in my hi-tech wet-weather kit. For them, the corner was literally life or death. My heart goes out to all those who have struggled, survived and died on this piece of water. It's been a long haul since the launch in NZ, and the most incredible adventure of my life. It's far more than just the story of a girl alone at sea. For me it's a story of teamwork, friendship and love. The story of so many people working towards a goal, and if not working, willing us on... I feel there are so many others with me on board. I've never been lonely - far from it. Day 72 A low-pressure area forming between two highs, will bring back the South American cold front - who will gain most? If I run the routing software for all the [leading] boats it suggests we'll all be at a similar latitude in a few days... I've been having amazing dreams for much of the race. Yesterday I dreamt Richard Branson was on board, but I've no idea why. If someone could find out whether he likes milk in his coffee, and how much, that would be great - I'd love to know if my dream was factually correct or not! Day 75 Ellen closing in on PRB. The pressure is rising, in more ways than one... Kingfisher this morning is positioned just 50 miles to the south of PRB and still 200 miles to the west. Behind Ellen, Active Wear has closed to less than 200 miles. This morning feels like a new start. It's incredible... we've had little wind - and now, thank goodness, it seems in 36 hours we might be able to tack [signalling entry to the SE trade winds, to the north of the St Helena high-pressure system - the 'hole' that has been blocking the route of PRB for days now]. It's a constant job of looking at tacking, trimming, keeping going. Frustrating - we need new winds. Day 79 Kingfisher and PRB head for Doldrums. The mast-climbing is back. During the night Ellen's wind instruments failed (they work from a 'wand' at the top of the mast). A two-hour climb to top of the mast, drill and sandpaper in hand, and the DIY Queen of the Seas had it fixed. A day of varied winds and many sail changes. The temperature has increased further, and sleeping, especially during the day, is difficult. Despite exhaustion it is well worthwhile as Kingfisher is once again crossing the waves at her full potential... a great feeling. Day 80 Tough in the Atlantic, less than 300 miles from the Equator... almost too late to choose another position to cross. I've been hand-steering all night, the replacement wind instrument wand wasn't working properly... I've been preparing mentally for another climb. I'm tired, but now it's light I have to go and sort it out [which she then does]. I'm totally exhausted, my leg is black from the bruises, I've got scratches and holes all over me. It was brutal. Once I got to the top a rain squall came over, the boat half-gybed on its own seven times. The wind was all over the place. The only way I could get her back the final time was to try to flick the top of the mainsail over with my body so the wind would fill on the right side again... I just want to cry. Day 81 Back in the Northern Hemisphere - and just 26 miles behind PRB! Ellen's third crossing of the equator in 10 months. My body still aches quite badly and I definitely need to get more sleep. Mich not surprisingly took a few miles on me yesterday during the day, but while I was sleeping immediately after coming down from the mast, I was heading further east than before as I just left the genoa up, and so we've closed on longitude [east/west separation], which I didn't actually want to do. He has, of course, not left me much room for manoeuvre. As he hit the calms I was still going great but I know that whoever gets away first is going to stack the miles on. Day 82 Kingfisher ranked first! Ellen sailed to the top of the ranking during the night. The 03:00 positions put her three miles ahead, although nine miles to the south and further east than PRB - in the battle to exit the Doldrums. Mich and I are suffering here, we've done just 65 miles in 24 hours, it's desperate. I am very, very tired, having entered the Doldrums quite exhausted after climbing the mast... that wasn't the best way to start this battle with the calms. I guess I had no choice. Mich and I are very stuck. This is exhausting. Day 83 PRB touched the Trade Winds about 10 hours before Ellen and managed to get away to the north and west - now holding a 46-mile lead. Once I lost my westerly position I never had the opportunity to get back there. I'm still kicking myself for my mistake three days ago when I fell asleep after climbing the mast, and let the boat head farther east. I always wanted to be west, but that moment of fatigue lost me that advantage... I can't help thinking where I would be if I'd held that more westerly position going in to the calms. Day 84/85 The long route north. PRB, Kingfisher, Sill and Active Wear are possibly - for the first time in a month - all sailing in basically the same conditions. Then disaster (or something) strikes\u0085 Kingfisher is damaged when she sails in to a solid object, suspected to be a semi-submerged container. She's left 79 miles behind PRB; 2,438 miles to go to finish for Ellen. All of a sudden there was the most almighty crunching sound and the boat felt like she had hit land. As I glanced behind to see what I had hit I saw part of the rudder and the daggerboard floating away. It was a gut-wrenching moment. I immediately ran through the boat, checking in all the watertight compartments that there was no water in there. There was obviously a big risk of having ripped the bottom of the boat open. The hull was fine, and it appeared that it was just the appendages [daggerboard, rudder] that were damaged... I will just try to do the best that I can. I promised that... could I still catch PRB? Big question. Anything can happen, absolutely anything can happen. Day 87 PRB slows as 'pressure' rises again. After four days of relatively steady sailing upwind in the Trades, PRB has started to feel the effects of the high-pressure system that blocks the route of the leaders. Ellen is 90 miles to his south and 40 miles east. This next 48 hours are going to be decisive. It's the last chance for anyone to pass I think. We seem to have been keeping our distance on third-placed Bilou\u0085 I'm sailing a bit closer to the wind and accepting some speed loss, so at least I'm not just following Mich's tracks. Day 89 PRB extends lead as storm approaches. Where are they? They are now to the west of Madeira, heading towards Cape Finisterre, the final landmark before the finish at Les Sables d'Olonne. Annoying to see how far Mich has got away... I have a cargo ship near me, but I haven't been able to see it at all, so I have to keep a constant lookout for it. I know he's there from the Active Echo radar detector, but I don't know where exactly. Not very relaxing. Day 91 It's 7 February. Rough but Kingfisher is holding position. After one of the toughest 24 hours for Ellen, she is mentally exhausted. Sill is still trapped by lighter winds and is now at 400 miles from Kingfisher, and Activewear is even farther back at 900 from PRB. I'm on a new chart - even better, I'm nearly a third of the way up the chart towards Les Sables. Got to go - looks like my lashing on the radar, broken during the daggerboard removal exercise has come loose\u0085 the radar is hanging down - got to try to save it. Day 93 Near disaster on the final lap - the genoa forestay main rigging holding the mast foreward fails. Ellen breaks a 36-hour silence on mishap. I didn't want to give Mich a reason to ease off, he could equally suffer gear failure if he pushes... and I didn't want to give Bilou a reason to attack harder. My heading and speed have dropped away compared with Mich, I decided it was time to share this bad news. I now have to focus on finishing in the top three - it's been a difficult 10 days. I'm ready to finish. Day 94 Patched Kingfisher second - end in sight. The wind has switched more south-west so although I'm sailing at a good speed of 13 to 15 knots, I'm making only 11 towards the finish. I look at the repair of the gennaker and pray - I'm surprised that it has lasted this long. Had the weirdest dream last night: we were all doing the Vend\u00e9e Globe on bicycles! Don't ask me what I'm doing next after this race... congratulations to Mich. \u0095 Adapted from material provided by Mark Turner of Offshore Challenges.

      "body": "<p>Have the two men who have ruled the Grand Prix world of Formula One for the best part of three decades finally fallen out? Certainly, motor racing fans turning to the financial pages last week might think their sport convulsed by a yet another spectacular bust-up at the top. </p> <p>To date, most of the squabbling has been over money between the top Grand Prix teams - the likes of Williams and McLaren - and Bernie Ecclestone, the diminutive tycoon who controls Formula One with a vice-like grip. </p> <p>The teams have also engaged in periodic bouts of blood-letting over rules and regulations with the sport's governing body - the Geneva-based F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) - and its president Max Mosley, son of the infamous British wartime fascist, Sir Oswald Mosley. A controversial investigation by the European Commission into Ecclestone's cosy links with the FIA has also cast a long shadow over the sport for the last three years. </p> <p>Last week, however, it seemed that the streetwise billionaire and his long-standing friend, Mosley, were at each other's throats. Ecclestone has failed to come up with a $60 million deposit for lucrative television and merchandising rights for the Grand Prix circuit. Struck last June, it was the latest in a long line of extraordinary, eyebrow-raising deals that have turned Ecclestone into one of Britain's richest men over the last 25 years. For $360m, the tycoon would extend his exclusive rights to sell the sport to its 5 billion viewers wordwide for a further 100 years until 2110. The price was a snip compared with the fortunes changing hands for Premier League and American football for a fraction of the duration. </p> <p>Mosley seemed up in arms over the $60m deposit. Drastic measures were threatened if the cash did not appear by the time the FIA's 150 members next assembled on 22 March. Ecclestone, it appeared, might be frozen out by an alternative deal with the sport's major carmakers, Fiat, Ford, BMW, Daimler-Chrysler and Renault, who have been eager for a further piece of the action. </p> <p>What you see in Formula One, however, is often the result of smoke and mirrors. For seasoned observers, and City cynics, the 'clash' between the erstwhile bosom buddies appeared too conveniently timed, when a 50 per stake in the sport itself now finds itself up for grabs. 'This row really looks complete fiction,' one Formula One insider said. 'Bernie is doing what he does best, wheeling, dealing and manoeuvring.' </p> <p>Peer through the burning rubber for a moment, therefore, and cast your eyes at Germany. Not at the infamous N\u00fcrburgring, which claimed the lives of Britain's Peter Collins and John Taylor and, in 1976, nearly killed Nikki Lauda. Look instead towards Munich and a troubled television company, which owns the Muppets, sells Bugs Bunny merchandise to German kids and last March bought 50 per cent of SLEC Holdings, Formula One's controlling company, for a cool $1.6bn. </p> <p>Under Ecclestone's guiding hand, the glamour of Formula One has never failed to mesmerise. Lately, noone has been more bewitched than Thomas Haffa, the charismatic founder of Germany's EM.TV. After breakneck expansion, however, including the $680m purchase of the Jim Henson Company a year ago, Haffa's ambition overreached itself. Just before Christmas, Germany's rising star - then worth more than the mighty Lufthansa - stunned the market with a profits warning and the revelation of accounting discrepancies. With \u00a3700m of debt, EM.TV is now being circled by vultures eager to pluck the Formula One jewel from its tarnished crown. And Ecclestone, as ever, is no mere spectator. </p> <p>EM.TV's stake already has a chequered history. The tycoon first parted with a 12.5 per cent share in Formula One in October 1999 for $325m to Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, a venture capital house owned by Germany's Deutsche Bank. The testosterone-charged deal was feted by bankers: after many false starts it was the first time the City had got its claws into Ecclestone's empire. </p> <p>The tycoon loathes bankers. In 1997, he dumped advisers Salomon Brothers after the failure of much-trumpeted plans to float Formula One. Since then, the 70-year-old has cashed in by other means. Eighteen months ago, he raised $1.4bn for his family trusts through a difficult bond issue. Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest Wall Street banks, found itself publicly ridiculed by Ecclestone after taking seven months to complete the deal, which had already been scaled back from $2bn. And even then, Morgan needed help from German bank WestLB, the tycoon's latest favourite, which - eager to muscle in on future deals - took half the issue itself. </p> <p>The love-in with the venture capitalists at Morgan Grenfell was short-lived. After failing to bring in Italy's Benetton and other high profile investors, Morgan Grenfell decided against taking up an option on another 37.5 per cent of the shares for $975m. Instead, Ecclestone sold the stake to San Francisco-based Hellman &amp; Friedman for a knockdown $700m, another band of US financiers who fell for Formula One's charms. When EM.TV came calling, the bankers took a quick profit. The trouble is that they took most of it in EM.TV's highly rated paper, whose price has since collapsed, leaving Morgan Grenfell red-faced with a loss of over $250m. </p> <p>'Ecclestone is laughing. He's the best deal-doer I've ever met,' said one City banker. 'So far, he's cashed in to the tune of $2.5bn and he still controls Formula One.' </p> <p>The tycoon's next card may be his smartest ace yet. As part of the EM.TV deal, Ecclestone agreed to give the Germans an option over another 25 per cent, ceding control for another $1bn. EM.TV, of course, is now in no position to buy anything.

      "bodyText": "Have the two men who have ruled the Grand Prix world of Formula One for the best part of three decades finally fallen out? Certainly, motor racing fans turning to the financial pages last week might think their sport convulsed by a yet another spectacular bust-up at the top. To date, most of the squabbling has been over money between the top Grand Prix teams - the likes of Williams and McLaren - and Bernie Ecclestone, the diminutive tycoon who controls Formula One with a vice-like grip. The teams have also engaged in periodic bouts of blood-letting over rules and regulations with the sport's governing body - the Geneva-based F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) - and its president Max Mosley, son of the infamous British wartime fascist, Sir Oswald Mosley. A controversial investigation by the European Commission into Ecclestone's cosy links with the FIA has also cast a long shadow over the sport for the last three years. Last week, however, it seemed that the streetwise billionaire and his long-standing friend, Mosley, were at each other's throats. Ecclestone has failed to come up with a $60 million deposit for lucrative television and merchandising rights for the Grand Prix circuit. Struck last June, it was the latest in a long line of extraordinary, eyebrow-raising deals that have turned Ecclestone into one of Britain's richest men over the last 25 years. For $360m, the tycoon would extend his exclusive rights to sell the sport to its 5 billion viewers wordwide for a further 100 years until 2110. The price was a snip compared with the fortunes changing hands for Premier League and American football for a fraction of the duration. Mosley seemed up in arms over the $60m deposit. Drastic measures were threatened if the cash did not appear by the time the FIA's 150 members next assembled on 22 March. Ecclestone, it appeared, might be frozen out by an alternative deal with the sport's major carmakers, Fiat, Ford, BMW, Daimler-Chrysler and Renault, who have been eager for a further piece of the action. What you see in Formula One, however, is often the result of smoke and mirrors. For seasoned observers, and City cynics, the 'clash' between the erstwhile bosom buddies appeared too conveniently timed, when a 50 per stake in the sport itself now finds itself up for grabs. 'This row really looks complete fiction,' one Formula One insider said. 'Bernie is doing what he does best, wheeling, dealing and manoeuvring.' Peer through the burning rubber for a moment, therefore, and cast your eyes at Germany. Not at the infamous N\u00fcrburgring, which claimed the lives of Britain's Peter Collins and John Taylor and, in 1976, nearly killed Nikki Lauda. Look instead towards Munich and a troubled television company, which owns the Muppets, sells Bugs Bunny merchandise to German kids and last March bought 50 per cent of SLEC Holdings, Formula One's controlling company, for a cool $1.6bn. Under Ecclestone's guiding hand, the glamour of Formula One has never failed to mesmerise. Lately, noone has been more bewitched than Thomas Haffa, the charismatic founder of Germany's EM.TV. After breakneck expansion, however, including the $680m purchase of the Jim Henson Company a year ago, Haffa's ambition overreached itself. Just before Christmas, Germany's rising star - then worth more than the mighty Lufthansa - stunned the market with a profits warning and the revelation of accounting discrepancies. With \u00a3700m of debt, EM.TV is now being circled by vultures eager to pluck the Formula One jewel from its tarnished crown. And Ecclestone, as ever, is no mere spectator. EM.TV's stake already has a chequered history. The tycoon first parted with a 12.5 per cent share in Formula One in October 1999 for $325m to Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, a venture capital house owned by Germany's Deutsche Bank. The testosterone-charged deal was feted by bankers: after many false starts it was the first time the City had got its claws into Ecclestone's empire. The tycoon loathes bankers. In 1997, he dumped advisers Salomon Brothers after the failure of much-trumpeted plans to float Formula One. Since then, the 70-year-old has cashed in by other means. Eighteen months ago, he raised $1.4bn for his family trusts through a difficult bond issue. Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest Wall Street banks, found itself publicly ridiculed by Ecclestone after taking seven months to complete the deal, which had already been scaled back from $2bn. And even then, Morgan needed help from German bank WestLB, the tycoon's latest favourite, which - eager to muscle in on future deals - took half the issue itself. The love-in with the venture capitalists at Morgan Grenfell was short-lived. After failing to bring in Italy's Benetton and other high profile investors, Morgan Grenfell decided against taking up an option on another 37.5 per cent of the shares for $975m. Instead, Ecclestone sold the stake to San Francisco-based Hellman &amp; Friedman for a knockdown $700m, another band of US financiers who fell for Formula One's charms. When EM.TV came calling, the bankers took a quick profit. The trouble is that they took most of it in EM.TV's highly rated paper, whose price has since collapsed, leaving Morgan Grenfell red-faced with a loss of over $250m. 'Ecclestone is laughing. He's the best deal-doer I've ever met,' said one City banker. 'So far, he's cashed in to the tune of $2.5bn and he still controls Formula One.' The tycoon's next card may be his smartest ace yet. As part of the EM.TV deal, Ecclestone agreed to give the Germans an option over another 25 per cent, ceding control for another $1bn. EM.TV, of course, is now in no position to buy anything. Ecclestone, however, also has a right to force EM.TV to take the shares: a 'put option' that can be exercised until May, which now hangs like a sword of Damocles over the Germans. 'If Bernie exercises the option, EM.TV will go to the wall. He's in a very advantageous position and is making best use of it,' one former adviser said. 'Someone will have to pay him not to do it. But it is a doubled-edged sword: the Formula One shares are also pledged as security to EM.TV's banks.' So far, so good. What Ecclestone is unhappy with, motor racing insiders say, is the prospect of Germany's Kirch Group, Europe's biggest pay-TV operator, getting hold of EM.TV and control of Formula One. Kirch, run by Germany's media hardman Dieter Hahn, is currently in exclusive talks to rescue EM.TV, though Haffa faces opposition from his board. What better way, cynics say, to scupper the talks than by questioning the value of Formula One itself. Ecclestone, too, hopes to take a slice of the shares back as a pay-off for letting his option lapse. Doubts over Grand Prix's future, therefore, just knock down the price. This weekend, silence from the Formula One camp simply added grist to the cynics' mill. 'This is where the \"row\" is all too well-timed. Bernie and FIA haven't legally completed their deal.

'The fact that Bernie hasn't yet concluded the deal creates uncertainty just as the poker starts over the Formula One shares. Bernie would love to get some of those shares back so he can sell them on again.' After 10 years in the driving seat, FIA members are due to vote on renewal of Mosley's presidency for another five-year term later this year. By then, the FIA will have little clout. Rights to Formula One will have been sold to Ecclestone and, under a deal with the European Commission, the FIA will just be a regulatory body. Despite his age, however, Ecclestone has no intention of leaving the stage. The tycoon is currently in talks with the carmakers, who are being advised by Goldman Sachs, over a stake of up to a third in Formula One.

'The more widely spread the shares are, the more clout Bernie will have. He likes to divide and rule,' one City source said. 'The best solution for everyone now is for Bernie not to exercise his option. But whatever happens, he'll go to his grave before he quits Formula One.'",

Moments later came a point-blank stop of a well-struck Lauren volley to keep Ipswich alive. Arsenal were on a roll, but so was Wright and he made a full-stretch save to keep out a crisp, low shot from Ashley Cole in the 23rd minute. </p> <p>A couple of bewildered Arsenal players approached Wright and seemed to ask him what he was up to - or on - as they waited for the latest in a series of corners. Wright's show of invincibility eventually had a positive effect on his team-mates as they began to shake off their early caution and negative tactics to probe Seaman's goal. </p> <p>Arsenal kept their grip on the game, but Ipswich began to play with belief rather than hope. Wenger sensed it and his response was to send on Henry for midfielder Lauren 13 minutes after the restart. </p> <p>If Ipswich were worried they did not show it as they created their best chance before Henry touched the ball. Martijn Reuser tossed an overhead kick to the far post and an unmarked Marcus Stewart failed to show how he had come into the game as the Premiership's leading scorer by getting the ball stuck under his feet with only Seaman to beat. </p> <p>But Wenger's feeling that Henry had been the missing link was confirmed when the French international scored in the 67th minute with his first sight of goal. Bergkamp ended a quick series of passes by springing Ipswich's offside trap to send Henry clear and this time Wright was helpless as a low right-foot shot zipped into the net to settle the game.</p>",

A couple of bewildered Arsenal players approached Wright and seemed to ask him what he was up to - or on - as they waited for the latest in a series of corners. Wright's show of invincibility eventually had a positive effect on his team-mates as they began to shake off their early caution and negative tactics to probe Seaman's goal. Arsenal kept their grip on the game, but Ipswich began to play with belief rather than hope. Wenger sensed it and his response was to send on Henry for midfielder Lauren 13 minutes after the restart. If Ipswich were worried they did not show it as they created their best chance before Henry touched the ball. Martijn Reuser tossed an overhead kick to the far post and an unmarked Marcus Stewart failed to show how he had come into the game as the Premiership's leading scorer by getting the ball stuck under his feet with only Seaman to beat. But Wenger's feeling that Henry had been the missing link was confirmed when the French international scored in the 67th minute with his first sight of goal. Bergkamp ended a quick series of passes by springing Ipswich's offside trap to send Henry clear and this time Wright was helpless as a low right-foot shot zipped into the net to settle the game.",

      "body": "<p>Steady on with talk of a Liverpool revival, at least until Thursday's Uefa Cup encounter with Roma. </p> <p>G\u00e9rard Houllier's team were decidedly fortunate to escape from Sunderland with a point, and might well have lost on Wearside for the first time in 43 years without the dodgiest of penalties awarded 12 minutes from the end.</p> <p>It was not that Stanislav Varga did not trip Gary McAllister, or that the Scot's tumble to earth in instalments was an attempt to con the referee, just that the Slovakian captain's none-too-discreet ankle-tap took place a good yard outside the area. </p> <p>Graham Barber checked with his linesman before confirming his decision, and Jari Litmanen equalised joyfully from the spot, which was fair enough since he and Michael Owen had originated the move which McAllister was attempting to finish. What was less just was Barber's strange decision to book Kevin Phillips for protesting, rather than Varga for what could only be interpreted as a professional foul by the last defender. Perhaps, knowing Varga had been cautioned 18 minutes earlier, the referee simply wanted to escape the North-East without a police escort. </p> <p>He must have been mightily relieved to see an offside flag rule out what looked like a winning goal from Robbie Fowler five minutes from time, for defeat would have been cruel on a battling Sunderland side who led for most of the second half through a goal from former Liverpool player Don Hutchison. </p> <p>'The players feel hard done by. There's no doubt the penalty changed the game,' Peter Reid said. 'We slightly lost our discipline after that.' </p> <p>This is debatable. Sunderland were bristlier than ever after two successive Premiership defeats, and there was niggle all through the game. Niall Quinn complained about holding, Michael Gray was booked for a crunching tackle on Gregory Vignal, and Reid remonstrated on the touchline with Barber - and that was just the first five minutes. </p> <p>Hutchison was lucky to get away with a succession of rash lunges, while Varga also went unpunished for standing on Emile Heskey's ankle, causing him to limp off after 27 minutes to be replaced by Litmanen. </p> <p>Hutchison got the booking he was asking for just before half-time for one of his more innocuous challenges on Vignal, who responded by retaliating and picking up a card of his own. In between the argy-bargy there were few occurrences of football until the game came to life after half-time. </p> <p>Vignal is a promising player, but his inexperience cost Liverpool dearly when Sunderland took the lead. Neat interplay between Julio Arca and Phillips had sent the latter into the Liverpool penalty area where he was abruptly stopped by Stephane Henchoz, but as Sunderland appealed vainly for a penalty Vignal had plenty of time to clear. Instead, he looked up to assess his options and was caught in possession, Arca's block giving Hutchison all the time and space he needed to place a shot low past Sander Westerveld. </p> <p>The home side were busily in pursuit of a second when Liverpool broke away for McAllister to win his penalty and prevent Sunderland leapfrogging their opponents into third place. The home crowd, even without the benefit of video replays, were deeply unimpressed. Reid did not join in the gigantic boo at the end, even though he probably felt like it, but he did have a pop when he heard that the referee intended to report three of his players (Hutchison, McCann and Arca) for over-zealous goal celebrations. </p> <p>'If I'd scored a goal against Liverpool I'd have been in the crowd with them,' Reid said. 'Football's about passion, and that was a smashing game, tackles flying in and everything. What do you want from a football match? I find this sort of thing staggering, petty and small-minded.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Steady on with talk of a Liverpool revival, at least until Thursday's Uefa Cup encounter with Roma. G\u00e9rard Houllier's team were decidedly fortunate to escape from Sunderland with a point, and might well have lost on Wearside for the first time in 43 years without the dodgiest of penalties awarded 12 minutes from the end. It was not that Stanislav Varga did not trip Gary McAllister, or that the Scot's tumble to earth in instalments was an attempt to con the referee, just that the Slovakian captain's none-too-discreet ankle-tap took place a good yard outside the area. Graham Barber checked with his linesman before confirming his decision, and Jari Litmanen equalised joyfully from the spot, which was fair enough since he and Michael Owen had originated the move which McAllister was attempting to finish. What was less just was Barber's strange decision to book Kevin Phillips for protesting, rather than Varga for what could only be interpreted as a professional foul by the last defender. Perhaps, knowing Varga had been cautioned 18 minutes earlier, the referee simply wanted to escape the North-East without a police escort. He must have been mightily relieved to see an offside flag rule out what looked like a winning goal from Robbie Fowler five minutes from time, for defeat would have been cruel on a battling Sunderland side who led for most of the second half through a goal from former Liverpool player Don Hutchison. 'The players feel hard done by. There's no doubt the penalty changed the game,' Peter Reid said. 'We slightly lost our discipline after that.' This is debatable. Sunderland were bristlier than ever after two successive Premiership defeats, and there was niggle all through the game. Niall Quinn complained about holding, Michael Gray was booked for a crunching tackle on Gregory Vignal, and Reid remonstrated on the touchline with Barber - and that was just the first five minutes. Hutchison was lucky to get away with a succession of rash lunges, while Varga also went unpunished for standing on Emile Heskey's ankle, causing him to limp off after 27 minutes to be replaced by Litmanen. Hutchison got the booking he was asking for just before half-time for one of his more innocuous challenges on Vignal, who responded by retaliating and picking up a card of his own. In between the argy-bargy there were few occurrences of football until the game came to life after half-time. Vignal is a promising player, but his inexperience cost Liverpool dearly when Sunderland took the lead. Neat interplay between Julio Arca and Phillips had sent the latter into the Liverpool penalty area where he was abruptly stopped by Stephane Henchoz, but as Sunderland appealed vainly for a penalty Vignal had plenty of time to clear. Instead, he looked up to assess his options and was caught in possession, Arca's block giving Hutchison all the time and space he needed to place a shot low past Sander Westerveld. The home side were busily in pursuit of a second when Liverpool broke away for McAllister to win his penalty and prevent Sunderland leapfrogging their opponents into third place. The home crowd, even without the benefit of video replays, were deeply unimpressed. Reid did not join in the gigantic boo at the end, even though he probably felt like it, but he did have a pop when he heard that the referee intended to report three of his players (Hutchison, McCann and Arca) for over-zealous goal celebrations. 'If I'd scored a goal against Liverpool I'd have been in the crowd with them,' Reid said. 'Football's about passion, and that was a smashing game, tackles flying in and everything. What do you want from a football match? I find this sort of thing staggering, petty and small-minded.'",

Co-founded by 26-year-old Emma Edelson with the backing of her father, Manchester United director Michael Edelson, the incubator was supposed to help nurture university start-ups. Much of the hype surrounding the firm came from the fact that Oxygen, like many other dotcoms, knew the publicity value high-profile directors brought to the company. Thus it was that PR guru Matthew Freud and media heiress Elisabeth Murdoch were appointed to the company's board. It was also well publicised that former Manchester United chief executive Martin Edwards was backing the company. </p> <p>But Oxygen, like the scores of other incubators that launched around the same time, found the going much tougher than anticipated.

The capital valuations are crazy and I'm pretty sure the bubble will burst.' She wasn't wrong. The day after Oxygen floated, Edelson, a former Cambridge University student, saw her \u00a311m paper stake slashed to a paltry \u00a3500,000 as the company's share price crashed by an unprecedented 95 per cent.

The company operated in five countries and had plans to launch new products and enter a raft of new markets. Even though there were question marks over other dotcom models, Virtual Internet looked assured because it had a business-to-business model rather than the business-to-consumer version.

      "body": "<p>In retrospect World of Fruit was never really going to set the world on fire. But last January the prospect of Fyffe's providing '24-hour secure online trading for the global fresh fruit and vegetable market' was sufficient to fuel a bananamania that added \u00a3370 million to the fruit importer's value. </p> <p>Perhaps the banana industry was well ahead of the curve. Fyffe's share price was already on the way down at this time last year. In less tendentious areas such as telecoms, technology and media, the dotcom speculative orgy was reaching a crescendo. </p> <p>Oxygen Holdings, which invests in entrepreneurial students, had just jumped 2,775 per cent on its first day on the stock market. Martha Lane Fox was planning her tour of newspaper offices and TV studios to promote the eagerly awaited flotation of Lastminute.com. Manchester United's \u00a330 million sponsorship deal with Vodafone was lauded as a foretaste of a new world of watching football on your wap phone. Tony Blair was launching his first weekly webcast to the nation. </p> <p>The media giants were getting stuck in, too. BSkyB's share price surged by a fifth on news that it was to invest \u00a3250m in internet ventures. Rupert Murdoch was busy proclaiming his reluctance to become a snack for a dotcom in the wake of AOL's merger with Time Warner. Overseas, his efforts to help Singapore Telecom take control of Hong Kong Telecom were scuppered by an unknown upstart new media company called Pacific Century Cyberworks. And an Indian software magnate briefly became the second richest man on the planet, after the 1,000lb gorilla of the international capital markets decided that Indian IT workers were the gold-dust of the New Economy. </p> <p>'This time next year we'll be millionaires,' was the cry of a raft of individuals breaking out of their corporate shackles and starting a website. And if they didn't have their own dotcom idea, they could simply steal other people's, and then claim to be running an 'incubator'. </p> <p>'Far too many people thought that they had the skills to become an entrepreneur. And every Tom, Dick and Harry was getting funding,' says Julie Meyer, founder of First Tuesday, and queen of the internet revolution in Europe. </p> <p>Dotcom types will tell you that one year by the Julian calendar is four years 'in internet time'. But February 2000 must feel like decades ago to the bruised egos and wallets of the net entrepreneurs. A number of theories have been put forward to explain dotcom fever - ranging from millennial madness to a serious dose of equity market psychosis. But as John Naughton argues in his column this week (<a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,436247,00.html\">Big blue meanies and cyberspace monsters...</a>), it's a phenomenon that's been seen before. </p> <p>What distinguishes dotcom fever is the element of mass participation, the role of the media and the extent of the inflation of the biggest bubble ever. Economist Robert Shiller's analysis, which was going to the presses this time last year, seems extremely prescient now. For him, the stock market bubble was the result of an irrational exuberance born out of herds, hype and triumphalism. Periods of wild overvaluation of equities were nothing new, and had historically coincided with 'new era' sentiment. In other words, every so often a new technology comes along that will clearly make some people a lot of money at some point in the future - and may even revolutionise the way we do business. </p> <p>This confidence in a sure-fire bet on the future obscures such pithy matters as who will win out, the size of their bounty, and when it will be secured. Add in the fact that in the short term the market rewards those who anticipate what everyone else will do, and you have a recipe for froth. </p> <p>But the degree of frothiness can be exploited as cover for incompetence and mismanagement, and can be directly or tacitly whipped up by interested parties. Enter the media and the famed equity analysts. </p> <p>The sports-style coverage of business issues in the mass media, particularly in the US, has given rise to superstar analysts such as Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch and Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley. Though the quality of their research is not in doubt, their objectivity is questionable. Banks are unlikely to issue 'sell' advice in a high-growth business when they, too are also touting for lucrative contracts. Additionally, if analysts' words can move markets, it's easy to see how a conflict of interest arises. </p> <p>Blodget is now the subject of a bitter internet-based campaign suggesting he talked up Amazon.com shares, to the eventual detriment of day traders who followed his advice. Meeker took time out to introduce Lastminute's Brent and Martha to institutional investors in the US. Morgan Stanley would eventually increase the price of Lastminute's float at a late stage from 190p to 380p. They now stand at 69.5p. </p> <p>For Shiller the equity analysts are too often a branch of the bank's sales team. But maybe the media are the real villains </p> <p> At the heart of the hype was the contention that the internet and related information industries were a revolution in the way companies and sectors organise themselves. It was more than just the emergence of a sexy new 'standalone' industry; it was a 'disruptive technology' that would cut costs and fatten profits across the economy. </p> <p>The technology would prove to be the glue binding together formerly discrete industries such as telecoms and media. Companies could join forces to seek out the cheapest supplies around the world, be it a tonne of cheese for a supermarket chain or a jumbo jet wing for an airline. </p> <p>At the same time, the US was experiencing a seemingly unending boom. The high growth rate and years of investment in IT were seen to be connected. But as any statistician knows, correlation is no proof of causation. </p> <p>Much of the net's value was thought to be enmeshed within existing corporations, specifically in the telecommunications and media sectors. Share valuations soared, and the companies borrowed and did deals on the back of those soaring valuations. </p> <p>Go back a couple of years and there were very few so-called 'pure-play' internet firms, but demand for their shares was high. It is this imbalance between supply and demand that pushed prices so high, attracting ever more interest in companies with little or no financial record. And this speculative froth was whipped up even more by marketing, publicity and hyperactive PR. Those companies that did come to market restricted the supply of stock and managed the release, guaranteeing a stel lar first-day performance, and yet more attention. </p> <p>Privately, bankers were scornful of market research of the type that claimed that e-commerce in the artichoke industry would be worth \u00a35bn by 2010. But the demand stoked by such reports offered early investors their profitable exit strategies. Suddenly a rush was on to push these companies to take advantage of the buoyant demand, speeding up the conveyor belt to flotation. </p> <p>At the same time venture capitalists and bankers were funding half-baked business plans and incapable managements. There was too much capital chasing too few ideas. </p> <p>Eventually a sufficient number of pure internet firms came to market for buyers to become discerning and, predictably, share prices slumped. For a while buyers looked to other sectors. Enthusiasm for 'optoelectronics', for example, propelled the share price of Bookham Technology, which rallied from March to July after the dotcoms had slumped. But it didn't last, particularly when stalwarts of the IT sector such as Apple and Microsoft issued profits warnings late last year. </p> <p>The conveyor belt juddered to a halt. Venture capitalists pulled the plug on investment funding in, for example, Boo.com. Collateral damage was felt in related industries. Companies from News Corp to Disney reined in their investments and slashed jobs. </p> <p>Telecoms companies were hit with an unexpected bill of billions for 3G (third-generation) licenses, the high watermark of irrational exuberance, and their credit ratings were downgraded. Like the Asian tigers in 1998, they found that with confidence undermined, capital markets are reticent when they are most needed. </p> <p>For the cheerleaders, a truly new economy had been created by IT investment, and the proof was an increase in the trend growth rate of productivity. But figures released last week showed that this trend had not been sustained in the early stages of the US slowdown. </p> <p>And even on Friday afternoon news was filtering through of another dotcom collapse, this time in the online travel sector. </p> <p>But is it all over? Well, there are clearly still some peaches among all the lemons. Perhaps selecting them is a job for World of Fruit's 10 remaining staff in Dublin. </p> <p><br> <a href=\"mailto:faisal.islam@observer.co.uk\">faisal.islam@observer.co.uk</a> </p> <p><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,436248,00.html\">New economy tycoons who flew too close to the sun</a></p> <p><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,436341,00.html\">Brought to book</a></p>",

But last January the prospect of Fyffe's providing '24-hour secure online trading for the global fresh fruit and vegetable market' was sufficient to fuel a bananamania that added \u00a3370 million to the fruit importer's value. Perhaps the banana industry was well ahead of the curve. Fyffe's share price was already on the way down at this time last year. In less tendentious areas such as telecoms, technology and media, the dotcom speculative orgy was reaching a crescendo. Oxygen Holdings, which invests in entrepreneurial students, had just jumped 2,775 per cent on its first day on the stock market. Martha Lane Fox was planning her tour of newspaper offices and TV studios to promote the eagerly awaited flotation of Lastminute.com. Manchester United's \u00a330 million sponsorship deal with Vodafone was lauded as a foretaste of a new world of watching football on your wap phone. Tony Blair was launching his first weekly webcast to the nation. The media giants were getting stuck in, too. BSkyB's share price surged by a fifth on news that it was to invest \u00a3250m in internet ventures. Rupert Murdoch was busy proclaiming his reluctance to become a snack for a dotcom in the wake of AOL's merger with Time Warner. Overseas, his efforts to help Singapore Telecom take control of Hong Kong Telecom were scuppered by an unknown upstart new media company called Pacific Century Cyberworks. And an Indian software magnate briefly became the second richest man on the planet, after the 1,000lb gorilla of the international capital markets decided that Indian IT workers were the gold-dust of the New Economy. 'This time next year we'll be millionaires,' was the cry of a raft of individuals breaking out of their corporate shackles and starting a website. And if they didn't have their own dotcom idea, they could simply steal other people's, and then claim to be running an 'incubator'. 'Far too many people thought that they had the skills to become an entrepreneur. And every Tom, Dick and Harry was getting funding,' says Julie Meyer, founder of First Tuesday, and queen of the internet revolution in Europe. Dotcom types will tell you that one year by the Julian calendar is four years 'in internet time'. But February 2000 must feel like decades ago to the bruised egos and wallets of the net entrepreneurs. A number of theories have been put forward to explain dotcom fever - ranging from millennial madness to a serious dose of equity market psychosis. But as John Naughton argues in his column this week (Big blue meanies and cyberspace monsters...), it's a phenomenon that's been seen before. What distinguishes dotcom fever is the element of mass participation, the role of the media and the extent of the inflation of the biggest bubble ever. Economist Robert Shiller's analysis, which was going to the presses this time last year, seems extremely prescient now. For him, the stock market bubble was the result of an irrational exuberance born out of herds, hype and triumphalism. Periods of wild overvaluation of equities were nothing new, and had historically coincided with 'new era' sentiment. In other words, every so often a new technology comes along that will clearly make some people a lot of money at some point in the future - and may even revolutionise the way we do business. This confidence in a sure-fire bet on the future obscures such pithy matters as who will win out, the size of their bounty, and when it will be secured. Add in the fact that in the short term the market rewards those who anticipate what everyone else will do, and you have a recipe for froth. But the degree of frothiness can be exploited as cover for incompetence and mismanagement, and can be directly or tacitly whipped up by interested parties. Enter the media and the famed equity analysts. The sports-style coverage of business issues in the mass media, particularly in the US, has given rise to superstar analysts such as Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch and Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley. Though the quality of their research is not in doubt, their objectivity is questionable. Banks are unlikely to issue 'sell' advice in a high-growth business when they, too are also touting for lucrative contracts. Additionally, if analysts' words can move markets, it's easy to see how a conflict of interest arises. Blodget is now the subject of a bitter internet-based campaign suggesting he talked up Amazon.com shares, to the eventual detriment of day traders who followed his advice. Meeker took time out to introduce Lastminute's Brent and Martha to institutional investors in the US. Morgan Stanley would eventually increase the price of Lastminute's float at a late stage from 190p to 380p. They now stand at 69.5p. For Shiller the equity analysts are too often a branch of the bank's sales team. But maybe the media are the real villains At the heart of the hype was the contention that the internet and related information industries were a revolution in the way companies and sectors organise themselves. It was more than just the emergence of a sexy new 'standalone' industry; it was a 'disruptive technology' that would cut costs and fatten profits across the economy. The technology would prove to be the glue binding together formerly discrete industries such as telecoms and media. Companies could join forces to seek out the cheapest supplies around the world, be it a tonne of cheese for a supermarket chain or a jumbo jet wing for an airline. At the same time, the US was experiencing a seemingly unending boom. The high growth rate and years of investment in IT were seen to be connected. But as any statistician knows, correlation is no proof of causation. Much of the net's value was thought to be enmeshed within existing corporations, specifically in the telecommunications and media sectors. Share valuations soared, and the companies borrowed and did deals on the back of those soaring valuations. Go back a couple of years and there were very few so-called 'pure-play' internet firms, but demand for their shares was high. It is this imbalance between supply and demand that pushed prices so high, attracting ever more interest in companies with little or no financial record. And this speculative froth was whipped up even more by marketing, publicity and hyperactive PR. Those companies that did come to market restricted the supply of stock and managed the release, guaranteeing a stel lar first-day performance, and yet more attention. Privately, bankers were scornful of market research of the type that claimed that e-commerce in the artichoke industry would be worth \u00a35bn by 2010. But the demand stoked by such reports offered early investors their profitable exit strategies. Suddenly a rush was on to push these companies to take advantage of the buoyant demand, speeding up the conveyor belt to flotation. At the same time venture capitalists and bankers were funding half-baked business plans and incapable managements. There was too much capital chasing too few ideas. Eventually a sufficient number of pure internet firms came to market for buyers to become discerning and, predictably, share prices slumped. For a while buyers looked to other sectors. Enthusiasm for 'optoelectronics', for example, propelled the share price of Bookham Technology, which rallied from March to July after the dotcoms had slumped. But it didn't last, particularly when stalwarts of the IT sector such as Apple and Microsoft issued profits warnings late last year. The conveyor belt juddered to a halt. Venture capitalists pulled the plug on investment funding in, for example, Boo.com. Collateral damage was felt in related industries. Companies from News Corp to Disney reined in their investments and slashed jobs. Telecoms companies were hit with an unexpected bill of billions for 3G (third-generation) licenses, the high watermark of irrational exuberance, and their credit ratings were downgraded. Like the Asian tigers in 1998, they found that with confidence undermined, capital markets are reticent when they are most needed. For the cheerleaders, a truly new economy had been created by IT investment, and the proof was an increase in the trend growth rate of productivity. But figures released last week showed that this trend had not been sustained in the early stages of the US slowdown. And even on Friday afternoon news was filtering through of another dotcom collapse, this time in the online travel sector. But is it all over? Well, there are clearly still some peaches among all the lemons. Perhaps selecting them is a job for World of Fruit's 10 remaining staff in Dublin. faisal.islam@observer.co.uk New economy tycoons who flew too close to the sun Brought to book",

      "body": "<p><strong>Kidman:</strong> 'Why haven't you ever been jealous about me?' </p> <p><strong>Cruise: </strong>'I don't know. Maybe because you're my wife...' ( Eyes Wide Shut ) </p> <p>Stanley Kubrick's ponderous, largely-plotless and highly-pretentious study of sexual obsession, Eyes Wide Shut, has made for more interesting viewing this week than when it came out. Some even claim that the film did for the marriage of its stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman - that their relationship 'never quite recovered' from the strain of exploring the subject of marital infidelity under the eye of their notorious obsessive-compulsive-perfectionist director, day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-tortuous month. </p> <p>It's a nice theory and suitably dramatic, but given that the couple have cited 'divergent careers' as a reason for the split, the making of Eyes Wide Shut probably constitutes their marital Good Old Days: neatly convergent careers working together in London while renting that lovely Nash house in Regent's Park, not getting papped every time they took the kids to school and enjoying weekends hiking in the Lake District. </p> <p>After the film wrapped, the couple hung around long enough for Kidman to work with Iain Glenn in David Hare's acclaimed The Blue Room at the Donmar Warehouse - the incandescently-reviewed production in which, interestingly, Kidman's powerfully sensual presence was exploited by director Sam Mendes in directly inverse proportion to the manner in which it had been neglected by Kubrick. </p> <p>But I don't think we can blame Kubrick for the end of the Cruise's matrimonial journey. Instead, I suspect that Nicole just woke up after a 11 years of marriage and decided she wanted to be more of a Kidman than she did a Cruise. </p> <p>Born in Hawaii in 1967 - where her father, a biochemist, was studying, and her mother was a nursing teacher and a feminist: 'I'd hand out pamphlets on the street with her and be scoffed at,' Nicole has recalled - the Kidman family moved back home to Sydney when Nicole was three. Her stage debut - wearing a car seat cover to play a sheep in her school nativity play - wasn't quite 'theatrical Viagra', while her father had nicknamed her 'storky' because she was already 5ft 10in by the time she started at North Sydney High School, convinced she was 'the ugliest person on earth'. </p> <p>The beanpole adolescent sought sanctuary in Saturday morning drama classes: her first kiss was a stage kiss and her professional debut was yelling 'Beat me! Harder! Harder! Harder!' in a Sydney production of Wedekind's Spring Awakening. She has, it is fair to say, never fought shy of theatrical challenges. She's even been described as 'the heavyweight theatrical actress who married a lightweight movie star'. </p> <p>By 17, Kidman had won an Australian best actress award for a TV mini-series, Vietnam, and 'knew I wasn't going to go to college. I wanted to cut loose. I was a nightmare to my parents. I lied to them. There was a time when my mother said: \"I can't live in the same house with her\".' Which sounds like fairly normal teenage foot-stamping, even for an award-winning thespian. Kidman then made the traditional Aussie rite-of-passage - travelling to Europe - and returned, sort-of grown-up, kind-of worldly. </p> <p>By 20, having made an impression at home and abroad in the teen romance Flirting and the thriller Dead Calm, with Sam Neill and Billy Zane, she went to Hollywood and pitched up to audition for a Tom Cruise vehicle (literally - it was about stock car racing) called Days Of Thunder. 'Tom stood up to shake my hand and there I was looking down on him,' Kidman says. But despite having three inches on her boss, it was apparently 'instant lust'. They married in Telluride, Colorado, on Christmas Eve 1990, when Kidman was 23 and Cruise 28, with one divorce (from Mimi Rogers, who famously described him as 'like a monk') already under his belt. </p> <p>But, lust aside, marrying Hollywood's biggest young star also meant marrying into his world: she became a Scientologist, though she says little on the subject (Tom deals publicly with Scientology, I don't...'); she fitted her career around his, conscious that she might be seen as the professional passenger in the relationship; she embraced his love of macho high-adrenaline pursuits ('I'm a fanatical sports freak. I love being able to do things like skydiving and aerobatics on the wing of Tom's biplane...'); she deftly juggled the demands of international celebrity homemaking ('a house in Sydney, a ranch with horses in Colorado and a place in Los Angeles, which is our albatross...'); and she remained necessarily tight-lipped on the subject of her own and her husband's fertility (though their two children, Isabella and Conor, are adopted, Kidman has dismissed reports of fertility treatment as 'complete bull'). </p> <p>And she has always colluded with Cruise's perceived control-freakiness: the hired help were alleged to have signed lengthy contracts banning them from revealing anything about the couple's domestic arrangements, while Cruise himself is famously litigious. </p> <p>Somehow, she also found time for acting, but it has been an odd sort of career, possibly hindered rather than helped by her husband. Certainly not an A-list actress (she auditioned for, but failed to win the leads in Ghost, Thelma and Louise, Sleepless in Seattle, The Silence of the Lambs, Mary Reilly and The Hudsucker Proxy, and only landed her big breakthrough role, as the murderously ambitious TV weathergirl in the deliciously dark To Die For, when Meg Ryan turned it down), Kidman's dazzling talent has never been in question, even when she has resorted to absurd 'clever-totty' roles in brainless blockbusters. (A neurosurgeon in Days of Thunder, a psychiatrist in Batman Forever and a nuclear physicist in The Peacemaker . Perhaps having a biochemist for a father explains the love of white coats.) </p> <p>But when she hasn't been simply clocking-on, she's made a bunch of highly eclectic professional choices, too. Though it bombed, one can understand Kidman's desire to work on Portrait of A Lady for Jane Campion (Campion was an early admirer of Kidman), but Practical Magic with Sandra Bullock? Then there is the upcoming Moulin Rouge and an intriguing-sounding adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Hours, alongside Meryl Streep (something of a Kidman role model) and the screen's other smart and luminously lovely, porcelain-skinned, titian-haired actress, Julianne Moore. Last week, too, it was revealed that negotiations have been underway to bring her back to the London stage, this time at the National Theatre. </p> <p>Even to seasoned celebrity-watchers, the announcement of the couple's split came as a bit of a surprise, if only because there hadn't been any new rumours (old ones, including the durable 'Is he or isn't he gay?', were still in circulation) so in Hollywood terms, where successful marriages are measured in dog years, theirs appeared to be extraordinarily solid. But with the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to rewrite the Cruise-Kidman script. Twenty three is, after all, quite young to get married. She probably just grew up. </p> <p>'We intend to return to Britain as soon as possible,' said Kidman at the end of her run in The Blue Room , as the couple prepared to decamp to Sydney while Tom made Mission:Impossible 2. Now it looks as though they'll be booking separate flights. In the long-term, I hope she avoids a nasty custody battle, escapes the clutches of Scientology, moves back to Sydney (she misses it, apparently, and hates LA) and that her career flourishes as it deserves to. Tom, meanwhile, will probably carry on with his predictable blockbusting high-adrenaline displacement activities - Mission:Impossible 3, 4 - and eventually find himself another, more malleable, Mrs Cruise. </p> <p><strong>Kidman to Cruise</strong> 'Forever?

      "body": "<p>With its peeling wallpaper and uneven chairs, the Bombay courtroom looks like a set from a Bollywood movie. But tomorrow, a self-confessed killer will stand trial here for murder.</p> <p>The case of Abdul Daud Rauf Merchant attracts a particularly zealous media circus. His testimony threatens to unveil the Bollywood-underworld nexus that stretches over continents to fund the country's largest export.</p> <p>In 1997, Bollywood music baron Gulshan Kumar was assassinated by a hit squad in Bombay (now renamed Mumbai) city centre. Last Tuesday, Merchant, an assassin employed by India's most feared gangland boss, Chotta Shakeel, was remanded in police custody. He has now confessed to receiving 100,000 rupees (almost \u00a31,500) from Shakeel as the first instalment for the murder of the music baron.</p> <p>His confession taints a film industry respected the world over for promoting family values. In the past 20 years, Bombay has expanded into the world's leading provider of cinematic escapism: a \u00a314 billion behemoth, churning out nearly 900 films a year and easily outpunching Hollywood.</p> <p>India alone has 13,000 cinemas, with a daily audience of more than 10 million. And the films form the staple diet of expatriates in Europe, South East Asia, the Middle East and the United States.</p> <p>Publicly, Bollywood stars and their associates - directors, producers and music writers - display a persuasive commitment to morality. Only last week, an array of actors made personal appearances throughout the city to raise funds for victims of the earthquake in Gujarat.</p> <p>Yet in recent weeks, Bombay has been rocked by a police investigation of underworld links. On 9 January police arrested film financier Bharat Shah, a big wheel in the diamond trade, for suspected links with Shakeel. Industry watchdogs claim he has sunk more than $43 million into Bollywood ventures.</p> <p>Earlier, police arrested Shah's producer, Nadeem Rizvi, and his assistant Abdul Khan, accused of acting as a conduit between the financier and the gang boss. Police claim to possess taped conversations between Rizvi and Shakeel in which the two discussed the progress of Shah's latest film, Chori Chori, Chupke Chupke ( Quietly Quietly, Softly Softly ). Shakeel subsequently fled to Karachi.</p> <p>India's leading film star, Salman Khan, was interrogated for five hours. His co-star in Chori Chori , Preity Zinta, was also questioned. The film's negatives have been seized, although bootlegged copies are available in Britain.</p> <p>With the branding of Bolly wood as a global leader in the early Nineties, a new breed of gangsters has cut a lucrative share of the fortunes. The Dubai-Karachi-Bombay trafficking of bootlegged films and soundtracks nets the underworld 400 billion rupees (about \u00a36bn) each year.</p> <p>The film-underworld connection has claimed lives. In 1997, film producer Mukesh Duggal was shot dead in Bombay; He was reputed to have borrowed money from another gang boss, Chotta Rajan, to finance his features. Police believe this led to his murder at the hands of Shakeel, in a revenge killing.</p> <p>In the same year, director Rajiv Rai survived a murder attempt, and last February, producer Rakesh Roshan was shot and injured after he refused to pay protection money to racketeers.</p> <p>The relationship between crime and filmmakers has forced out a veteran generation of thespian talent. As India's most prominent screen hero during the Fifties and Sixties, Dilip Kumar's reputation outgrew the didactic craft of Bollywood musicals. His movies - left- wing, politically motivated dramas - are national treasures that make him the local equivalent to Marlon Brando.</p> <p>Kumar, 78, went into semi-retirement in the Eighties and turned to directing.

      "bodyText": "With its peeling wallpaper and uneven chairs, the Bombay courtroom looks like a set from a Bollywood movie. But tomorrow, a self-confessed killer will stand trial here for murder. The case of Abdul Daud Rauf Merchant attracts a particularly zealous media circus. His testimony threatens to unveil the Bollywood-underworld nexus that stretches over continents to fund the country's largest export. In 1997, Bollywood music baron Gulshan Kumar was assassinated by a hit squad in Bombay (now renamed Mumbai) city centre. Last Tuesday, Merchant, an assassin employed by India's most feared gangland boss, Chotta Shakeel, was remanded in police custody. He has now confessed to receiving 100,000 rupees (almost \u00a31,500) from Shakeel as the first instalment for the murder of the music baron. His confession taints a film industry respected the world over for promoting family values. In the past 20 years, Bombay has expanded into the world's leading provider of cinematic escapism: a \u00a314 billion behemoth, churning out nearly 900 films a year and easily outpunching Hollywood. India alone has 13,000 cinemas, with a daily audience of more than 10 million. And the films form the staple diet of expatriates in Europe, South East Asia, the Middle East and the United States. Publicly, Bollywood stars and their associates - directors, producers and music writers - display a persuasive commitment to morality. Only last week, an array of actors made personal appearances throughout the city to raise funds for victims of the earthquake in Gujarat. Yet in recent weeks, Bombay has been rocked by a police investigation of underworld links. On 9 January police arrested film financier Bharat Shah, a big wheel in the diamond trade, for suspected links with Shakeel. Industry watchdogs claim he has sunk more than $43 million into Bollywood ventures. Earlier, police arrested Shah's producer, Nadeem Rizvi, and his assistant Abdul Khan, accused of acting as a conduit between the financier and the gang boss. Police claim to possess taped conversations between Rizvi and Shakeel in which the two discussed the progress of Shah's latest film, Chori Chori, Chupke Chupke ( Quietly Quietly, Softly Softly ). Shakeel subsequently fled to Karachi. India's leading film star, Salman Khan, was interrogated for five hours. His co-star in Chori Chori , Preity Zinta, was also questioned. The film's negatives have been seized, although bootlegged copies are available in Britain. With the branding of Bolly wood as a global leader in the early Nineties, a new breed of gangsters has cut a lucrative share of the fortunes. The Dubai-Karachi-Bombay trafficking of bootlegged films and soundtracks nets the underworld 400 billion rupees (about \u00a36bn) each year. The film-underworld connection has claimed lives. In 1997, film producer Mukesh Duggal was shot dead in Bombay; He was reputed to have borrowed money from another gang boss, Chotta Rajan, to finance his features. Police believe this led to his murder at the hands of Shakeel, in a revenge killing. In the same year, director Rajiv Rai survived a murder attempt, and last February, producer Rakesh Roshan was shot and injured after he refused to pay protection money to racketeers. The relationship between crime and filmmakers has forced out a veteran generation of thespian talent. As India's most prominent screen hero during the Fifties and Sixties, Dilip Kumar's reputation outgrew the didactic craft of Bollywood musicals. His movies - left- wing, politically motivated dramas - are national treasures that make him the local equivalent to Marlon Brando. Kumar, 78, went into semi-retirement in the Eighties and turned to directing. His thoughtful style would be replaced at the box office by the inflammatory hysterics of Amitabh Bachchan, India's self-styled 'angry young man'. Kumar remembers: 'As the films became more successful, the formulaic style of Bollywood became apparent. Crime was sexy - the heroes were almost interchangeable with the bad guys. The movies dealt less with the injustices in Indian society.' Film industry cognoscenti speak of a witch-hunt by the city's police department. Salman Khan turned down several requests for interviews with The Observer . 'How can a person in the film industry get a fair trial? The police have created this media storm,' says Mahesh Bhatt, the director of Daddy and Aag (Fire). His films cater to a niche, literate audience. He has controversially tackled themes as diverse as racism, divorce and the role of women in Indian society. 'I wouldn't go as far as to draw a parallel between what is happening here and the McCarthy hearings. Not yet anyway,' says Bhatt, who has questioned Shah's detention. 'But are the police naive enough to think they can smash organised crime by investigating the film industry? These criminals are like corporations: they account for 2 per cent of the global economy. There's a rot in Indian society: and it stretches all the way to the judiciary and politics.' But Bombay's police force, itself beset by accusations of corruption, seeks out the invisible hands controlling Bollywood as a possible vindication of its war against crime. 'This is no witch-hunt,' says D. Sivananhan, the Joint Commissioner of Police. 'The police are determined to start cleaning up these gangs,' he says. 'And in order to do that, some influential people will have to face some tough questions.' Despite the controversy stirred by the Bharat Shah case, the tabloids are crammed with studio announcements for pending releases. Pahlaj Nihalani, president of the Film Producers' Association of India, says: 'The last year was particularly bad financially: not many films turned over a profit. So filmmakers are increasing their productivity. Most actors are committed to as many as six films a year. 'Remember that Bollywood holds a mirror to Indian society. If you find something rotten at the heart of the film world here, it's an indication of a wider malaise.'",

Have a glass of champagne.' </p> <p>This is a phrase, it's quite clear, that Ken Russell has hardly shied from in his many years; a phrase he would like to hear on his first minute in heaven. I'm quietly impressed at the supreme confidence with which he can still tilt his glass just-so and utter the words, given the bathos of our surroundings. </p> <p>We are not in some ritzy private LA screening room watching Glenda frolic naked in Women in Love, waiting to spend our millions on the town that night quaffing and joshing with Ollie Reed. We are sitting at the top of exhausting stairs in a tiny Soho studio watching a blow-up sex doll and a blow-up Godzilla having simulated sex, filmed on a camcorder, while Britain's one-time most famous director attempts to dub in orgasm noises lifted from a porn movie. The film was shot on his camcorder, cost under \u00a320,000 to make and has no buyer. He might, tragically, try to release it on the internet. He's having a lot of fun. </p> <p>He is doing what he does best, matching sound to music. The film itself might stink (it's too early to say, of course, but I know where the smart money would go), as did a number of his high-profile efforts of the Seventies and early Eighties, but he remains a consummate master of split-second dubbing, and the care he brings to knitting together the screams of orgasm and the final footage of Godzilla's busy tail is the same infinitely subtle care with which he famously meshed tragic and uplifting moments from the lives of Elgar, or Debussy, or Liszt, or Tchaikovsky, to their music, which he still loves so much (Elgar's his favourite overall, since you ask; probably Falstaff ). This can never be taken away from him. The rest of the movies, and their infamy at the time - the devils, or Reed and Alan Bates wrestling naked, or Strauss and Nazi nuns - can; in fact they were. He cannot remember the last time he was asked to make a film; which is why, at 73, he's decided to do it himself with what little money he has left; he wants, again, to have fun. But despite his obvious glee, it's still an absurd come-down. What on earth happened to Ken Russell? </p> <p>'Most people think I'm dead,' he says, matter-of-factly. 'I don't really know what happened. Mistakes. And, whoever you are you need an agent, and mine... well, my last agent got me one job in 20 years and my present agent hasn't got me a job at all.' </p> <p>He sighs. 'You should remember that in the Seventies the Americans were all here. United Artists, Columbia, Paramount, they all had huge offices here, and weren't afraid to spend money on British ideas, and take risks. Great times. Then the tax deals got less attractive, and they also got less interested in European-style films, with irony, which were not totally commercial. If anything was happening here in England, it didn't seem to involve me. I wasn't frozen out exactly, but at one point I was offered two films: Valentino, or The Rose, about Janis Joplin, and I foolishly chose Valentino. Even more foolishly I chose Nureyev to portray him, which was a disaster. I couldn't get a performance out of him, the accent was hopeless, and he slapped his co-stars and lost the respect of the crew. It was awful, he hated everyone. </p> <p>'Then I got offered sci-fi and horror movies, and foolishly turned these down. Yes, mistakes. And nothing seemed to happen. I sent scripts off to British Screen, and they were returned. I can't even remember what happened in the Nineties. Did anything happen? It's a total gap. I wrote a novel, I suppose, which didn't do well. </p> <p>'So about a year ago, I had a rebirth. I got tired of waiting for the phone to ring and decided two things. One, that by hook or by crook I would make my own movies and, two, that I was tired of living alone and that I would look for company. I advertised for a soul mate.' None of his three ex-wives, unsurprisingly, responded, but a younger American fan, Elise, did, and they now look extremely happy. After he 'decided to get off my arse', life again became 'tremendous fun'. </p> <p>But this, I say, can't have been what he thought he would be doing at 73? </p> <p>'No.' He grows slightly grumpy. 'Not at all. I suppose I thought I would be going on being a success. I suppose I wish I had a bit more money. But this kind of film-making is why I started, to have fun with images and sound. And I'm beholden to no one.' </p> <p>Did he wonder whether his fascination with modern Gothic, with shocking images and kitsch humour, had made him too much of a stereotype? 'Please don't forget I made a lot of films with no horrible images at all: The Rainbow and the BBC films on composers. Song of Summer , about Delius, is probably my best. But I don't resent the others. They made an impact.' Which was - you guessed it - 'fun'. </p> <p>'The Sixties were a great time for pushing back the boundaries; we could do it, so we did. I think, paradoxically, Britain is now much less tolerant; the culture is narrowing rather than broadening...' He went to the Evening Standard film awards, 'where I sat next to Twiggy, and I suddenly realised the Sixties were like the Twenties. It was an age of invention, of fun, of exuberance. Things happened. I could make Women in Love and the Music Makers. I could make documentaries on composers nobody had ever heard of, and show them to a mass audience. That's now gone, completely, and it's sad; we're left with the Daily Mail mentality, where everything's safe and yet prurient.' </p> <p>He thinks, and sighs again. 'Perhaps I should have moved to America. If I had I'm sure I would have done better. If you're on the end of a telephone to them it's as if you're on Mars; if you're there beside them, they believe in you. But I wanted to keep living here. I love the New Forest. It's steeped in folk memory. You never feel lonely.' </p> <p>He doesn't know, exactly, from where his fascination with the modern Gothic stems and doesn't want to to have 'said' anything about it. But he does talk, probably tellingly, about one project: 'I was asked to do a script on Peter Pan for an American company, and it seemed to write itself. It's called Never land , and the script's been accepted with no changes, which is astonishing, and I believe it could happen. </p> <p>'I found myself identifying a great deal with J.M. Barrie: he never grew up, never lost his innocence or his sense of wonder, and that is something to be cherished. I've still a lot of that inside me.' His smile is cherubic. </p> <p>One suspects that in the fast-moving cultural times of the Seventies and Eighties, in the fastest-moving medium, he just didn't grow up enough. Even now, with the camcorder movie, the preoccupations seem terribly dated; and not even Sixties, but Eighties; goths and punk and rock stars and sex dolls and lubricious outrage, there to shock for shock's sake rather than make a wider point, at a time when it's all been done. </p> <p>His amanuenses now are two girls from the 'Underground Movement'; one is called Emma Millions, the other Tulip Junkie. It seems tired, and slightly sad; growing up is not always a bad thing. But there is something exuberantly life-affirming in his refusals either to go quietly, or to have an attack of taste.

      "body": "<p>The Clare Valley is an unlikely setting for a revolution. This unhurried, gently bucolic spot, an hour-and-a-half's drive to the northwest of Adelaide, has a reputation for producing some of Australia's finest Rieslings, but it's not exactly a hotbed of radicalism and sedition. The thought of local wine producers manning the vinous barricades is faintly absurd. Or was, until the 2000 vintage. </p> <p>Just over a year ago, 14 Clare Valley wineries decided to bottle some or all of their Rieslings with screwcaps (or Stelvin closures, as they're known Down Under). Screwcaps don't have a particularly good image in Australia, despite the fact that they are arguably the best closure for wine.</p> <p>They don't have a very good image here, either. Screwcaps are generally associated with Lambrusco, cheap Spanish Muscat and the park-bench set. I once saw a less-than-sober customer in a branch of Kwik Save tearing the top off a bottle of Moscatel de Valencia before he'd got to the checkout. When Penfolds did a consumer trial with their Bin 2 Shiraz/Mourv\u00e8dre in the UK, they met with considerable resistance from consumers. Natural corks, however unreliable, were their closure of choice.</p> <p>The remarkable thing about the Clare Valley initiative (apart from the fact that it happened at all) is that the producers concerned include some of the best in the country, such as Mount Horrocks, Jim Barry and Jeffrey Grosset. These are not cheap, low-end operations. The Clare Valley group has started an important trend. It is surely no coincidence that, in the Napa Valley, PlumpJack recently released its 1997 Reserve Cabernet with a screwcap at $135 (\u00a392) a bottle. In my view, it will be the first of many.</p> <p>So far, the Australian public has been enthusiastic about screwcaps. There have been one or two (possibly apocryphal) reports of consumers taking bottles back to off-licences with corkscrews stuck in the cap, but most people have been happy to 'twist, not screw' as the Jim Barry marketing campaign would have it.</p> <p>Stephanie Toole, the feisty owner of Mount Horrocks, says that the reaction has been very positive Down Under. 'People have told me that, \"We're sick of bloody cork,\"' she says. 'There's nothing better than opening a bottle and pouring it without having to worry.' She thinks that unwooded Semillon and early-drinking red-wine producers could follow the Clare Valley's lead over the next few years. 'We have to educate the consumer, but it's only a matter of time.'</p> <p>Toole says that the cork industry has 'upped the ante' in Australia, with comments in newsletters and sniping from the various wine consultants it employs. 'They invited me to a dinner last year, but I didn't go, I thought the idea was dreadful,' says Toole. Worryingly for the cork industry, the Clare Valley screwcap brigade is growing in number. Several companies that were reluctant to do the twist in 2000 have ordered the required bottles and closures for the 2001 vintage. The revolution continues.</p> <p><strong>Best cellars Four millennial Rieslings to savour</strong></p> <p><strong> 2000 Jim Barry Watervale Riesling </strong> (\u00a35.99, Tanners, 01743 234 500; General Wine Company, 01428 722 201). Jim Barry bottled part of its production with corks in 2000, including, sadly, the stuff that has been shipped to the UK.

      "bodyText": "The Clare Valley is an unlikely setting for a revolution. This unhurried, gently bucolic spot, an hour-and-a-half's drive to the northwest of Adelaide, has a reputation for producing some of Australia's finest Rieslings, but it's not exactly a hotbed of radicalism and sedition. The thought of local wine producers manning the vinous barricades is faintly absurd. Or was, until the 2000 vintage. Just over a year ago, 14 Clare Valley wineries decided to bottle some or all of their Rieslings with screwcaps (or Stelvin closures, as they're known Down Under). Screwcaps don't have a particularly good image in Australia, despite the fact that they are arguably the best closure for wine. They don't have a very good image here, either. Screwcaps are generally associated with Lambrusco, cheap Spanish Muscat and the park-bench set. I once saw a less-than-sober customer in a branch of Kwik Save tearing the top off a bottle of Moscatel de Valencia before he'd got to the checkout. When Penfolds did a consumer trial with their Bin 2 Shiraz/Mourv\u00e8dre in the UK, they met with considerable resistance from consumers. Natural corks, however unreliable, were their closure of choice. The remarkable thing about the Clare Valley initiative (apart from the fact that it happened at all) is that the producers concerned include some of the best in the country, such as Mount Horrocks, Jim Barry and Jeffrey Grosset. These are not cheap, low-end operations. The Clare Valley group has started an important trend. It is surely no coincidence that, in the Napa Valley, PlumpJack recently released its 1997 Reserve Cabernet with a screwcap at $135 (\u00a392) a bottle. In my view, it will be the first of many. So far, the Australian public has been enthusiastic about screwcaps. There have been one or two (possibly apocryphal) reports of consumers taking bottles back to off-licences with corkscrews stuck in the cap, but most people have been happy to 'twist, not screw' as the Jim Barry marketing campaign would have it. Stephanie Toole, the feisty owner of Mount Horrocks, says that the reaction has been very positive Down Under. 'People have told me that, \"We're sick of bloody cork,\"' she says. 'There's nothing better than opening a bottle and pouring it without having to worry.' She thinks that unwooded Semillon and early-drinking red-wine producers could follow the Clare Valley's lead over the next few years. 'We have to educate the consumer, but it's only a matter of time.' Toole says that the cork industry has 'upped the ante' in Australia, with comments in newsletters and sniping from the various wine consultants it employs. 'They invited me to a dinner last year, but I didn't go, I thought the idea was dreadful,' says Toole. Worryingly for the cork industry, the Clare Valley screwcap brigade is growing in number. Several companies that were reluctant to do the twist in 2000 have ordered the required bottles and closures for the 2001 vintage. The revolution continues. Best cellars Four millennial Rieslings to savour 2000 Jim Barry Watervale Riesling (\u00a35.99, Tanners, 01743 234 500; General Wine Company, 01428 722 201). Jim Barry bottled part of its production with corks in 2000, including, sadly, the stuff that has been shipped to the UK. But this is still a good introduction to Clare Riesling, with ripe, full-flavoured lime and citrus-peel fruit and a softish, dry finish. 2000 Grosset Watervale Riesling (\u00a311.99, Milton Sandford, 01628 829 449).

      "body": "<p>There has been a red cabbage in the bottom of the fridge for longer than I care to say. It has been quietly watching me, probably wondering when it was going to get its 15 minutes of fame. Once the purple pride of my shopping bag, it now sits and haunts me as surely as an unposted thank-you letter. </p> <p>You cannot wait to get certain vegetables into the pot - bunches of spinach, those frilly hearts of kale as beautiful as any Valentine bouquet and, for me especially, the spoon-leafed Chinese veggies such as pak choi and their juicy stems. They have an urgency that invites you to cook them the minute you get them home. Others just sit there quietly nagging, continually passed by for something fresher and more short-lived, until their wizened presence embarrasses us enough to put them out of their misery. </p> <p>It is always the same with winter vegetables. The last two celeriac I bought ended up on the compost heap - shame on me - but I promise never to let it happen again. I picked them up in a fit of enthusiasm for their creamy ivory skin and lush plume of emerald green. Those leaves dried to a crisp, their skin withered and turned grey - in short, they rotted. Deep down I knew they were there, waiting patiently as I roasted pumpkins, steamed mustard greens and blitzed beetroot into juice. Every time I put a Savoy cabbage, a bunch of fat carrots, a football-sized red cabbage into my bag, I could hear them screaming: 'Use us, use us.' After a fortnight or so, their pleas had become a barely audible whimper. After three weeks in the vegetable rack, my heads of celeriac resembled nothing more than Norman Bates's mother in her rocking chair. </p> <p>My red cabbage on the other hand is beginning to feel like an old friend. We renew our friendship once a week when I clean out the salad drawer, rekindling my enthusiasm by peeling off another layer of blackening leaves, once as crisp as chicken bones, to reveal a fresh purple gloss. This week, I promise. </p> <p>The initial excitement was for its deep magenta leaves with their dusty bloom of mauve. As you turn the hard head of leaves over in your hand, you cannot but help picture the brilliant, jewel-like colours you will get when your shredded red cabbage meets the sting of wine vinegar. Yet I rarely get round to using a red cabbage till its outer skin is black and its once-tempting crunch has softened to a dull thud. This vegetable's keeping-qualities are its downfall. Put it into the same use-me-quick category as spinach or sorrel and it would be the star of any table. </p> <p>When it finally gets to the stove, the red cabbage is almost certain to meet its knee-jerk fate of being cooked with apples and vinegar. And I don't see why not - the pairing works. Cabbage of any colour likes meeting up with juniper berries, garlic, onions, apples, vinegar and pork. Such flavours flatter. But there are others, too. I made a crisp salad this week with shredded cabbage lightly fried in oil then drained and tossed with lumps of fried smoked bacon, crumbled pecan nuts, rough shards of Cheshire cheese and a mustard, oil and white-wine vinegar dressing. It was a little gem of a winter salad. </p> <p>Bacon has crept into many of the season's vegetable dishes. The smoky saltiness is perhaps the answer to accompany the roast parsnips, to tip over the mashed swedes and to sneak into the cabbage stir-fries that make up much winter fodder. It will turn up with the new head of celeriac I have just bought, too. I will coarsely grate it while the vegetable is still firm and pale and toss it in the hot bacon fat with some toasted walnuts and some roughly chopped fennel fronds. This week, I promise. </p> <p><strong> Boiled gammon and red cabbage with juniper sauce</strong><br> </p> <p>Cabbage has a well-known affinity with ham, as does apple, and all three work beautifully with juniper. It seemed only natural to bring them all together for a winter's Saturday lunch. I have used some of the ham's cooking liquor in the juniper sauce and just a very little cream, but given it some edge with a squeeze of lemon. Five of us ate this for a Saturday lunch with baked sweet potatoes. The fluffy, vivid orange potatoes took about 50 minutes at 200 C/gas mark 6 and made sense what with the slight bitterness of the cabbage and juniper and the fact that the hob is already full with ham, sauce and cabbage pots and the oven empty. We had a bit of Stilton and the rest of the celery afterwards. Serves 5-6. </p> <p><strong> 1.5kg piece of smoked gammon </strong><br> <strong> 1 bottle of apple juice </strong><br> <strong> 2 large carrots </strong><br> <strong> 2 sticks of celery </strong><br> <strong> 2 leeks </strong><br> <strong> 1 small onion </strong><br> <strong> 2 or 3 bay leaves </strong><br> <strong> 8 juniper berries </strong></p> <p><strong> for the cabbage</strong> </p> <p><strong> a little peanut oil </strong><br> <strong> 2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely chopped </strong><br> <strong> 1 small red cabbage or half a larger one, finely shredded </strong></p> <p>for the sauce</p> <p><strong> 3 ladlefuls of the gammon cooking liquor </strong><br> <strong> 6 or 7 juniper berries, crushed in a pestle and mortar </strong><br> <strong> 1-2 tsp Dijon mustard </strong><br> <strong> 3-4 tbsp double cream </strong><br> <strong> a squeeze of lemon juice </strong></p> <p>Put a large pot on the stove, sit the gammon in it, and pour in the apple juice and enough water to lap at the top of the meat. Bring to the boil, then skim off the froth that comes to the surface. Turn the heat down so that the liquid is just bubbling, then slide in the carrots and celery, nicely scrubbed, the washed leeks, the onion, bay leaves, the juniper berries and 4 or 5 whole black peppercorns. Let the meat simmer gently for about an hour, maybe a little longer, until it is cooked right through to the middle. If you are doing the baked sweet potatoes, and I hope you are, then put them in when the ham has been on for about 20 minutes. </p> <p>Once the ham is cooked, get a frying pan hot with a little peanut oil in it. Add the garlic, then the shredded cabbage, tossing it around for a minute or two over high heat until the cabbage is bright and garlicky. </p> <p>Remove three or four ladlefuls of the stock into another, smaller pan, add the juniper berries and let it boil until it has reduced by half. This will only take a few minutes at a good boil. Now stir or whisk in the mustard and the cream and grind in a little black pepper. Taste for salt - I find it doesn't need it, but much will depend on your ham. </p> <p>Carve the ham, laying it in a warm dish or plate with some of the cooking liquor spooned over to keep it moist and hot. Take it to the table with the sauce (give it a last-minute bubble to get it really hot), squeezing in the lemon at the last minute. Serve the ham, the cabbage and the potatoes, spooning a little of the juniper sauce over the ham as you do so. </p> <p><strong> Red cabbage with juniper and dill</strong><br> </p> <p>You could, of course, eat this sweet-sour cabbage with pork or bacon. I ate it with store-bought rollmops, and some big, fat boiled potatoes. Lots of chopped dill, and a glass of beer turned it into a pleasant enough supper. The rollmops were sharp and cold, and the potatoes hot and floury, and the cabbage hot and sweet and sour. I had found some dark rye bread, too. Lively tastes for a winter's day. </p> <p>There is nothing new about adding sweet and sharp flavours simultaneously to red cabbage. You could substitute sultanas or raisins for my apricots if you wish (I used them because of their sweet-tartness), and you might prefer white-wine vinegar to my red. The point is simply to soften the cabbage's 'cabbaginess' with a mixture of sweet and sharp flavours. The juniper berries bring a bitter herbal note, too. Serves 4 as a side dish. </p> <p><strong> half a small cabbage, or a quarter of a larger one </strong></p> <p><strong> 1 onion </strong></p> <p><strong> a little olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong> 1 fat clove of garlic </strong></p> <p><strong> the juice of 1 orange </strong></p> <p><strong> 6 juniper berries </strong></p> <p><strong> 6 dried apricots </strong></p> <p><strong> 3 tbsp red-wine vinegar </strong></p> <p><strong> a few bushy springs of dill </strong></p> <p>Peel the onion and cut it into thin slices. Put it into a heavy-based pan with a little olive oil and set it over a low to moderate heat. Shred the cabbage finely, cutting away and discarding the hard core. Rinse thoroughly, then drain and add to the onion with the garlic, peeled and sliced, and a good grinding of salt. Turn the cabbage in the oil, raising the heat if nothing much is happening, till the colour is bright - a matter of a minute or two. </p> <p>Halve the orange and squeeze it. Squash the juniper berries roughly, maybe with the flat of a heavy knife blade or a pestle. You don't want them so much to be a powder, more simply well bruised. (The smell will be not dissimilar from that of a gin and tonic.) Slice the apricots. Pour the juice and stir the berries and apricots into the cabbage, cover with a tight lid, and leave to steam for 15 minutes or so. You want the cabbage to be soft and vivid purple. </p> <p>Pour the vinegar into the cabbage and leave for a minute till most of it has evaporated, then chop the dill and toss it in.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is a sense in which journalists should not write about things they really care for, lest either that affection is displayed for what it is - a flimsy, irrational, delicate thing - or else they somehow exhaust the emotion in the articulation. I feel like that about primroses. I know that I love them but I am not really sure why or how. But they hit the spot with devastating accuracy every time. Perhaps flowers are like a perfume, tugging at memory and response as you pass, irresistibly cutting a swathe through the densest protection. </p> <p>By primrose I do not mean the whole range of primulas (400-odd species and, according to The RHS A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants (\u00a350, Dorling Kindersley) - now in two volumes so using it is less like balancing a palmful of bricks - 'Primula is a complex genus divided into many botanical sections'). I mean Primula vulgaris , the prime rose, the first flower that grows best in hazel coppices and deciduous woodland with clearings around oak standards, but which also grows on the mossy banks of lanes and tracks across this country from January through to Easter. This unimproved, unhybridised, straightforward, exquisite flower has the magic.</p> <p>This morning I picked a little bunch - not many, because they are not yet prolific in the garden and will not be so for another week or two - made terribly fragile by the ice that encrusted them, although in fact they are tough and able to take almost any weather that Britain can conjure. Half of them were almost transparent with cold but slowly absorbed their familiar colour as the warmth crept into them. One of the reasons that I cannot be doing with the hybrids is simply the power of the colour association with the word 'primrose'.</p> <p>These few petals in the tiny vase by my keyboard, growing sodden as the frost in their veins thaws, are their own colour. This actually ranges quite loosely from the palest yellow to quite an orangey lemon, but a primrose cannot be violet or apricot or magenta - or worse - and retain any sense of self. That type of breeding from natural species is like some crazy branding exercise by a group of shiny-arsed management consultants, as though inventing names is on par with creating something. I would strongly argue that the wild primrose is literally perfect and that any attempt to 'improve' it is a profound misuse of time and energy.</p> <p>The hummocks of leaf and flower at this time of year are tight and tangled, but they grow out from this as the weeks go by until they make a natural posy, the flowers arched artfully from the surrounding splay of leaves.</p> <p>Many years ago, when I was a child, it was an annual ritual to collect baskets of primroses to decorate the church and graveyard at Easter. We would set off up to the woods and coppices and plunder them for their flowers. These would be tied into posies of varying generosity, depending on how good a year it was - and I seem to remember that it varied a lot from year to year - but whatever the size of the bunch, they were always tied with coloured wool and always included three or four leaves. These would be carried up to the church on Easter Saturday in a container of water, before going round with a dibber to each grave and planting each bunch into the ground.

I am proud to say that I felt a touch of guilt about this. But, with hindsight, the good thing was that it taught me to look at a flower very closely, to recognise instantly its lovely scent, to know how it grew and shaped itself and to see where it was most easy and prolific. How many children get the chance to do that today?</p> <p>For a gardener, it drums home the obvious but vital importance of giving each plant conditions as close to its natural environment as possible. The logic for me is to grow plants that either originate locally or in conditions similar to those of this garden, rather than trying to create an 'unnatural' microclimate. So all our primroses are planted in the tiny coppice that we have been nurturing for the past five years. They like wet soil best, with summer shade. The drier the local climate, the more they need shade and heavy soil that will hold moisture.</p> <p>So, if you are planting primroses and you do not live in the wet west, add plenty of organic material to help conserve moisture for the roots. If you are putting them into a bank, plant them near the top as they will tend to spread down, and plant at least two clumps so they can cross-pollinate. They will spread steadily, especially if exposed to light every few years, so if they are in a border make sure they are underplanting shrubs that can be pruned hard every now and then, such as cornus, hazel or willows. The primrose's natural companions are violets, bluebells, and - if you are lucky and the wood is very old - wood anemone.</p> <p>Some people lump primroses and cowslips ( Primula veris ) together, but in fact they like very different conditions, with cowslips coming from free-draining chalky downland. I grow ours along the verge of a grass path, letting the grass grow up tall until the cowslips have seeded, and then mow them in with the grass (by now very long) in July. Primroses would resent this kind of treatment and don't do well in grass unless the ground is very wet. They can more or less be left alone, although they do not seem to mind being moved and can be split easily enough. The best time to do that is in early summer, when they have completely finished flowering. Primroses and cowslips have apparently always crossed, and it was from this union that the polyanthus was bred. I cannot love this offspring a fraction as much as I care for both parents. I know they have a gaiety and freshness when massed - as in the nuttery at Sissinghurst - but it is that pink again. I have a lot of trouble with pink.</p> <p>Actually, the polyanthus is chiefly bred from the false oxslip, itself a natural and common cross between cowslip and primrose (so why the ox? Why not cowrose or primslip?). It is recognisable from the true oxslip because it holds its flowers upright and primrose-like at the top of a cowslip-like stalk.</p> <p>The true oxlip, Primula elatior , has its flowers hanging modestly to one side and is a species in its own right, and very rare. Where it does occur - mainly in a small patch on the Essex/Suffolk border - it grows profusely and, locally, can seem terribly common. It is primrose-like in that it likes plenty of moisture and will grow happily in woods as well as damp meadows - which the cowslip will not do. To be honest, looking at its picture while writing this makes me wonder why we do not grow the true oxlip here. We will.</p> <p><strong>My roots</strong></p> <p>I spent the whole of last week in London. This had its odd moments - as in Cherie Blair looking me in the eye and saying, 'Who the hell is Monty Don?' and somehow I don't think she was coming over all metaphysical - but two places struck me most. The first was Chelsea Physic Garden, which I know of old. This time I got a guided tour around its glasshouses, potting shed and seed-packing room, which was a great treat. </p> <p>The thing that struck me most - other than the quiet air of modest expertise that hung over the place - was how their resources were no greater than many a private garden I have been to. I still expect gardens of the great and good to have a secret - some system or kit that explains things. There never is. It is just people doing something carefully and well. So visit the Physic Garden and give it some money - they will spend it wisely. </p> <p>I also went to a city farm - Mudchute, on the Isle of Dogs. No garden, of course, and more an animal sanctuary than a farm, but in its own way impressive and entirely laudable. Whereas the Physic Garden is tucked away, the Mudchute City Farm is open to the landscape, overlooked by the towers of Canary Wharf. But seeing both together made it clear to me that although I love farming and grew up with it, in the end tending animals is not enough. I have to grow things. </p> <p>This is the longest that I have been away from the garden for six months, so at first light on Saturday I did a proprietorial sneak round, checking changes with that mixture of excitement and dread that any gardener is familiar with. </p> <p>In fact, a week of flooding and frost meant that not much had grown. But the daffodils are rising green-fused from the blackened tatters of their pre-Christmas leaves. The big frost between Christmas and New Year did for that early growth, but obviously not for the bulbs. I have a nasty suspicion that it also did for the Clematis balearica 'Freckles', which flowered for the first time last year and was budding up well. The snowdrops are in their prime and the hellebores are nakedly appearing, heads down and leafless. </p> <p>But the best thing in the garden happened before I got up. At 6.45am the light began to open up and a robin and then a wren sang modestly for 15 minutes and then were quiet. Not much. Hardly a dawn chorus. But I got the message.

      "bodyText": "There is a sense in which journalists should not write about things they really care for, lest either that affection is displayed for what it is - a flimsy, irrational, delicate thing - or else they somehow exhaust the emotion in the articulation. I feel like that about primroses. I know that I love them but I am not really sure why or how. But they hit the spot with devastating accuracy every time. Perhaps flowers are like a perfume, tugging at memory and response as you pass, irresistibly cutting a swathe through the densest protection. By primrose I do not mean the whole range of primulas (400-odd species and, according to The RHS A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants (\u00a350, Dorling Kindersley) - now in two volumes so using it is less like balancing a palmful of bricks - 'Primula is a complex genus divided into many botanical sections'). I mean Primula vulgaris , the prime rose, the first flower that grows best in hazel coppices and deciduous woodland with clearings around oak standards, but which also grows on the mossy banks of lanes and tracks across this country from January through to Easter. This unimproved, unhybridised, straightforward, exquisite flower has the magic. This morning I picked a little bunch - not many, because they are not yet prolific in the garden and will not be so for another week or two - made terribly fragile by the ice that encrusted them, although in fact they are tough and able to take almost any weather that Britain can conjure. Half of them were almost transparent with cold but slowly absorbed their familiar colour as the warmth crept into them. One of the reasons that I cannot be doing with the hybrids is simply the power of the colour association with the word 'primrose'. These few petals in the tiny vase by my keyboard, growing sodden as the frost in their veins thaws, are their own colour. This actually ranges quite loosely from the palest yellow to quite an orangey lemon, but a primrose cannot be violet or apricot or magenta - or worse - and retain any sense of self. That type of breeding from natural species is like some crazy branding exercise by a group of shiny-arsed management consultants, as though inventing names is on par with creating something. I would strongly argue that the wild primrose is literally perfect and that any attempt to 'improve' it is a profound misuse of time and energy. The hummocks of leaf and flower at this time of year are tight and tangled, but they grow out from this as the weeks go by until they make a natural posy, the flowers arched artfully from the surrounding splay of leaves. Many years ago, when I was a child, it was an annual ritual to collect baskets of primroses to decorate the church and graveyard at Easter. We would set off up to the woods and coppices and plunder them for their flowers. These would be tied into posies of varying generosity, depending on how good a year it was - and I seem to remember that it varied a lot from year to year - but whatever the size of the bunch, they were always tied with coloured wool and always included three or four leaves. These would be carried up to the church on Easter Saturday in a container of water, before going round with a dibber to each grave and planting each bunch into the ground.

It had no champions and powerful enemies. </p> <p>But there is an important potential quid pro quo. There promises to be a compensating commitment to establish elected assemblies for the English regions if supported by regional referendums, with a voting system modelled on London's, where a form of PR is used to top up the assembly's numbers. The new politics will be piloted in the new regional capitals, cities such as Leeds, Newcastle, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester and Norwich. </p> <p>Regionalism is not where you would first look for votes or even policy innovation, or so most London-based commentators instinctively feel. You either need a big idea or some eyecatching national policy - selling council houses or slashing taxes - if you want to cut a political dash. Wrong. </p> <p>Britain and England have been subtly changing for more than 15 years, and there are the first signs of a new self-confidence in our regions and regional cities, together with an appetite for tackling their problems locally. Labour, with its powerful political base in precisely these areas, has been quick and astute enough to identity the change. This is a party and government that moves cautiously - behind public opinion if it can - so if it recognises a new support for regional politics, be sure its antennae have detected something stirring. </p> <p>In the 1980s, I spent five years as economic correspondent for Newsnight or, rather, as it sometimes seemed, the economic chronicler of Britain's regional woes under Thatcherism. There seemed no city outside London which did not in one way or another tell the same tale of de-industrialisation, economic decay and social disintegration, with a local political and social \u00e9lite desperately concerned but unable to do anything as power was increasingly concentrated in Westminster and Whitehall. You couldn't make the same reports today; the economic, social and cultural depression is no longer so ubiquitous. </p> <p>There remain areas of apparently endemic and irredeemable blight, but there is nowhere which does not have a hot spot of vigorous economic activity with living standards and attitudes that match those of London. Indeed, London itself is desperately polarised with incredible wealth and poverty coexisting in the same boroughs, especially in the north-east and south-east. </p> <p>What Labour has grasped, partly as a matter of intellectual conviction and partly as a recognition of political reality, is that while national policies of redistribution, reinforcement of public services and encouragement of enterprise go so far they need to be customised to the needs of individual regions. And that the only effective agencies are the people whose fates and loyalties lie with particular cities and regions and who are now beginning to agitate against their political powerlessness. </p> <p>Economic and social problems vary hugely, even within England. One pressing problem is to establish proper east-west rail links between the North-West and North-East. In the Midlands, where 60 per cent of Britain's internationally traded goods are manufactured, the issue is how to grow and sustain a smart manufacturing base to replace ageing and uncompetitive plant. In Yorkshire, Leeds has emerged as a national and regional growth pole; it needs to be supported rather than undermined by the ambitions of its rivals, while Yorkshire itself needs to raise its level of business start-ups and hi-tech presence. </p> <p>In the South-East, the question is how to balance London's potential destiny as the pre-eminent global city with the needs of the rest of the region. In the South-West and East Anglia, the dominant issue is how to deal with stunning levels of illiteracy and innumeracy. All require regional initiatives where the priorities are importantly different. </p> <p>This has long been the view of Richard Caborn at the Department of Trade and Industry and Hilary Armstrong at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Il capo of English regionalism, John Prescott, has made the case consistently, generally to deaf ears. But for the past three months, the argument has taken off, the most important convert being Gordon Brown. Two weeks ago, he called for a 'Britain of regions and nations with a new dynamism', continuing: 'We are moving from the old Britain of subjects, where people had to look upwards to a Whitehall bureaucracy for their solutions, to a Britain of citizens where, region to region... we are ourselves in charge.' </p> <p>Brown has come to this view not least because of the economic arguments, set out last week in a paper edited by Ed Balls, chief economic adviser to the Treasury, and John Healy MP, Brown's parliamentary private secretary. Six out of eight English regions have per capita incomes below the European average, writes Balls. National solutions go so far, but real engagement with regional failings must come from the bottom up. If that were successful, then Britain would have more balanced growth and close the productivity gap with its rivals. </p> <p>Balls wants to build on the eight English Regional Development Agencies already established by Labour, giving them more cash and more flexibility to prioritise what they choose. He accepts they need to be accountable, but the system he, along with the Chancellor, proposes is to use the existing network of regional chambers - a collection of regional notables and local councillors - alongside a new regional committee in the House of Commons. They need to go further and my suspicion is that they already have. By 2004, the RDAs will be spending \u00a31.7 billion between them, a scale of publicly-led investment not seen since the days of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the 1960s and the National Enterprise Board in the 1970s; indeed, RDAs are emerging as New Labour's interventionist arm. </p> <p>But if accountability and bottom-up engagement are to mean anything, RDAs need to be held to account by their local communities, in other words, elected regional assemblies. </p> <p>Here, Labour enters a witch's brew of internecine rivalries as powerful regional cities campaign to be the regional capital - Sheffield against Leeds, Manchester against Liverpool, Newcastle versus Sunderland - with the open question being whether there are really any regional loyalties that might underpin the legitimacy of the new assemblies. My view is that Labour has little choice. It wants vigorous RDAs and the demand for accountability and regional political direction is following in their wake. The regional chambers are powerless talking shops. Necessarily they must become elected, reinventing the English regions of the Saxon era - and the manifesto is about to accept that ineluctable logic. </p> <p>Proportional representation was meant to reinvent British politics, which it would have done, but the march of regionalism is no less significant. New Labour conceives of the assemblies as toothless tigers, but already we know better, as London, Scotland and Wales have proved. We are watching, instead, the quiet and long overdue reinvention of the British state.</p>",

All require regional initiatives where the priorities are importantly different. This has long been the view of Richard Caborn at the Department of Trade and Industry and Hilary Armstrong at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Il capo of English regionalism, John Prescott, has made the case consistently, generally to deaf ears. But for the past three months, the argument has taken off, the most important convert being Gordon Brown. Two weeks ago, he called for a 'Britain of regions and nations with a new dynamism', continuing: 'We are moving from the old Britain of subjects, where people had to look upwards to a Whitehall bureaucracy for their solutions, to a Britain of citizens where, region to region... we are ourselves in charge.' Brown has come to this view not least because of the economic arguments, set out last week in a paper edited by Ed Balls, chief economic adviser to the Treasury, and John Healy MP, Brown's parliamentary private secretary. Six out of eight English regions have per capita incomes below the European average, writes Balls. National solutions go so far, but real engagement with regional failings must come from the bottom up. If that were successful, then Britain would have more balanced growth and close the productivity gap with its rivals. Balls wants to build on the eight English Regional Development Agencies already established by Labour, giving them more cash and more flexibility to prioritise what they choose. He accepts they need to be accountable, but the system he, along with the Chancellor, proposes is to use the existing network of regional chambers - a collection of regional notables and local councillors - alongside a new regional committee in the House of Commons. They need to go further and my suspicion is that they already have. By 2004, the RDAs will be spending \u00a31.7 billion between them, a scale of publicly-led investment not seen since the days of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the 1960s and the National Enterprise Board in the 1970s; indeed, RDAs are emerging as New Labour's interventionist arm. But if accountability and bottom-up engagement are to mean anything, RDAs need to be held to account by their local communities, in other words, elected regional assemblies. Here, Labour enters a witch's brew of internecine rivalries as powerful regional cities campaign to be the regional capital - Sheffield against Leeds, Manchester against Liverpool, Newcastle versus Sunderland - with the open question being whether there are really any regional loyalties that might underpin the legitimacy of the new assemblies. My view is that Labour has little choice. It wants vigorous RDAs and the demand for accountability and regional political direction is following in their wake. The regional chambers are powerless talking shops. Necessarily they must become elected, reinventing the English regions of the Saxon era - and the manifesto is about to accept that ineluctable logic. Proportional representation was meant to reinvent British politics, which it would have done, but the march of regionalism is no less significant. New Labour conceives of the assemblies as toothless tigers, but already we know better, as London, Scotland and Wales have proved. We are watching, instead, the quiet and long overdue reinvention of the British state.",

      "bodyText": "Working-class children will be given piano lessons, ballet classes and other traditional perks of a middle-class childhood under a revolutionary \u00a335 million government 'credit' to level the educational playing field. Education Secretary David Blunkett wants the state to make it up to the pupils left standing at the school gate while their wealthier peers are whisked off for after-school treats and coaching. The 'Billy Elliot' revolution' aims to bridge the gap with up to \u00a3360 per pupil at some inner city schools to pay for activities broadening children's horizons and nurturing artistic talent - such as theatre visits, drama classes or music lessons. 'These ideas are a crucial contribution to targeting cash at youngsters and schools who need it most, to do what better-off parents or leafy suburban communities are already able to afford,' said one senior source. Blunkett will tomorrow publish his blueprint for the future of schools, expected to promise new targets for raising standards among 11- to 13-year-olds. Trainee teachers will also have their student debts paid off by the Government if they stay in subjects where there are serious shortages such as maths and science, in an incentive to recruitment. And the Excellence in Cities programme - turning around failing inner city schools and tempting middle-class parents to send their children - is expected to be extended to a third of all schools. This follows evidence that pupils' GCSE results improve faster where the scheme is used. The theme of the plan will be an equal chance for every child through to university and beyond. For the first time it will focus not only on improving disadvantaged children's exam scores and basic skills, but on their wider lives through the pupil learning credit scheme for cultural extras. Blunkett will make clear the activities for 11- to 16-year-olds - which could be after school or during the day - will open their eyes to an educationally stimulating world. 'Anyone who has been anywhere near a school to collect their kids, off to a piano lesson or ballet class or whatever, will have noticed the children that don't get to go, don't get any stimulation like that, and it's not the parents' fault - they just can't afford it,' said one source. The scheme is reminiscent of the film Billy Elliot in which a boy from a working- class background takes up ballet, to the mockery of his family and classmates, only to turn out to be a star. The number of \u00a32,000 bursaries helping disadvantaged teenagers go to university will also be more than doubled. Pupil learning credits will target up to 65,000 children from disadvantaged backgrounds from September. Schools must have more than 35 per cent of pupils claiming free school meals to qualify and will get grants starting from \u00a3240 per child, rising to \u00a3360 for the worst off. The cash will be used by schools to set up clubs or pay for trips. Ministers believe the two-year pilot scheme can give poorer children a chance to tap into undiscovered talents. Blunkett also wants all primary school children at least to have the chance either to learn a new sport or a musical instrument. Meanwhile, Trade Secretary Stephen Byers will unveil plans making it easier for the founders of small businesses to bounce back if their start-ups fail. Honest people who go bankrupt through no fault of their own could be free to return to business within 12 months rather than after the present three-year quarantine.

      "body": "<p>There was hardly a cloud in the sky last week when Disney chief executive Michael Eisner proudly opened the California Adventure, the company's latest theme park. It was a picture-perfect Disney moment, all gaiety and happy endings. </p> <p>The same cannot be said for Disney itself. The entertainment colossus has been experiencing heavy weather. Although it narrowly beat analysts' downgraded financial expectations for the last quarter of 2000, its overall performance is far less impressive than the 22 per cent rise in headline earnings suggests. </p> <p>The 'House of Mouse' has been enjoying strong performances at the box office and reliable attendance at its theme parks, but rising costs and the slowing US economy, combined with the collapse of its internet ambitions and weakness in its holdings in ABC television and cable channel holdings, could soon spell real problems. </p> <p>Ten days ago, Disney reported improved sales and earnings for the whole of its last financial year. Revenue increased by 9 per cent to $25 billion, compared with $23bn in 1999. But in the last quarter net income fell by 82 per cent to $63 million. 'The year ended better than we had expected but not better than what we knew was possible, given our company's wealth of assets,' Eisner said. </p> <p>The company attributes its successful year to ABC's hit television quiz show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and record operating results for its theme parks and resorts in the US, Asia and Europe. Yet Disney shares fell by 15 per cent amid concern about future earnings. </p> <p>One of Disney's biggest problems is what to do with ABC. Like its main rivals NBC and CBS, the network is struggling for ratings. A year ago, ABC was riding towards prime-time supremacy and record profits on the unexpected success of Millionaire. One year later, the game show has plunged back to earth, and for ABC it has suddenly become a life raft. </p> <p>Mired in a deep creative slump, marked by only one genuine sitcom hit in four years, ABC depends on the four-times weekly show more than ever. Analysts say Millionaire, which has more episodes in a year than most shows produce in a lifetime, is both a wonder drug and a dangerous addiction for ABC. Although its editions are all still among the top 10 popular programmes, its ratings are down this season by an average of about 26 per cent - a decline that helps to expose a lack of new hits, or even of serviceable new shows. </p> <p>'Our biggest concern is what happens if it fades more,' a top ABC executive said. </p> <p>Once the master of family-orientated, middle-American-style comedies such as Home Improvement, ABC slashed its programme budgets by as much as half, lulled by the vast profits its aspirational gameshow was making. So while other networks made 30 or more pilot shows last season, ABC made only 12. </p> <p>'Nobody's that smart,' says one TV producer. 'You have to take more shots than that. It's just the nature of this business to make a lot of pilots, because you don't know which will work.' </p> <p>Perhaps even more worrying for ABC is that its Millionaire addiction has raised the median age of its audience from 41 to 46, while it has failed to launch new, 'younger' shows. This is serious, because ABC, like rivals NBC and Fox, bases all its success on how well it fares with viewers aged between 18 and 49, the group most sought by advertisers. </p> <p>'Millionaire was the ultimate Band-aid,' says Sandy Grushow, Fox's chairman of entertainment. 'The question is whether it covered a scab or a tumour. Millionaire bought them one year. We thought it would be at least two.' </p> <p>Disney's troubles, however, reach beyond ABC. The failure of its internet business is a significant blow. It is in good company - all the other media outlets and networks - from CNN to the New York Times - are scaling back their web investments and cutting staff, but Disney's ambitions were always much grander. </p> <p>Its offering, Go.com, was supposed to become a fully-fledged portal, but that business had long since been sewn up by America Online and Yahoo! At its inception in January 1999, the company predicted it would have more than 8 million registered users and an audience share of 36 per cent. </p> <p>But the visitors never came and Disney abandoned its struggling operation, laying off 400 staff, putting its search engine up for sale and refashioning its stalled internet strategy last month. It withdrew its internet tracking stock from trading - it was the first big company to do this - and said it would take more than $800m in charges against its earnings. </p> <p>But Disney has not ruled out buying what it has been unable to create for itself. Last week, Eisner told Wall Street analysts he would 'pounce and pounce well' when he saw an opportunity. </p> <p>He may be willing to pursue Yahoo! as a means of competing with the merged entertainment behemoth AOL Time Warner - if the price was right. 'Yahoo is a great company,' he said. 'The problem is it's just over-valued - and way too expensive at $50bn or even $25bn.' </p> <p>But he responded to criticism that Disney has been too timid in seeking acquisitions by saying: 'We are not going to make one to give journalists headlines, to make bankers wealthy, or for our egos.' </p> <p>The company maintains that an internet enterprise remains central to its strategy. Disney president Robert Iger said the decision to close Go.com was made in order to focus on the company's branded sites, such as Espn.com and Disney.com, while formulating a broadband strategy that could soon deliver pay-per-view movies directly to homes and bypass traditional video distribution. </p> <p>Tom Staggs, Disney's chief financial officer, said: 'We're going to focus on those businesses where we think we can create value.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, Disney's consumer products arm, which sells merchandise based on its screen heroes, continues to suffer, with operating income down nearly 14 per cent to $177m, while revenue fell 6 per cent to $828m. About 100 of its 700 retail stores will now be closed. </p> <p>But Disney has found suc cess in its theme parks - including Disneyland Paris, which reported a 64 per cent increase in net income for the year. Once dismissed as little more than a long-term property investment, these are now being praised for extracting more revenue from customers. </p> <p>A knotty succession problem has been settled with Iger's appointment, and questions over Eisner's famously controlling management - arising after his ill-advised court battle with former lieutenant Jeffrey Katzenberg - seem to have receded. Nevertheless, more than a dozen top managers have left in the past two years, and of the four men he started with in 1984, Eisner is the only one left. </p> <p>So can Disney regain its lustre on Wall Street? It expects double-digit growth this year, but economic uncertainty and the success Disney finds with summer blockbuster films such as Pearl Harbor are likely to dictate the answer.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There was a triumphalist tone to the trumpet Lord Wakeham was blowing this week as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission. His smart bash at Somerset House to celebrate the PCC's tenth birthday was a huge public relations success. </p> <p>Even though the coverage of the event was less about the PCC and press self-regulation and more about the soap opera involving Prince Charles, Prince William and Camilla Parker Bowles, that one glamourous event must have done more to raise public awareness of the PCC than its entire promotion budget for the past decade. </p> <p>Wakeham, it has to be said, has a lot to be triumphant about. The old Press Council, from which the PCC sprang in 1991, had lost all credibility with politicians and the public. It had been destroyed by the press itself. When the old Press Council reprimanded John Junor, then editor of the Sunday Express, for a racial slur in his personal column, he repeated the offending words in print and called the Council 'po-faced, pompous, humourless twits'. Margaret Thatcher knighted him two years later for his services to journalism. </p> <p>When the old Press Council investigated the orgy of chequebook journalism that built up around Sonia Sutcliffe, wife of the Yorkshire Ripper, it found that David English, then editor of the Daily Mail, and others of Fleet Street's finest evaded, lied and failed to cooperate. English refused to attend an oral hearing. When he and his paper were found guilty of gross misconduct, Sir David (for he had been knighted by Thatcher while the inquiry was in progress) wrote an article in which he described the findings as 'short-term, short-sighted and smug', proving 'yet again that the Press Council still does not understand the concept of a free press'. </p> <p>Looking back over the PCC's first decade, Wakeham deserves congratulation for rescuing it from a shaky start. Sir David Calcutt's 1993 review of its first two years concluded that it had failed and should be replaced by a statutory body. Also that year, a Commons Select Committee came out in favour of privacy legislation, and the erratic behaviour of its first chairman, Lord McGregor, over a case involving clandestine photographs of Princess Diana in a leotard, caused the Mirror Group to pull out of the PCC for several days. </p> <p>So to arrive at glittering Somerset House from the dark days of 1993 has been a real achievement. With the Prime Minister, Culture Secretary Chris Smith and Tory leader William Hague all declaring that freedom of the press is central to democracy and the PCC its handmaiden, Wakeham can say: 'There are no serious commentators now who believe that statutory controls are either desirable or practical.' Indeed, compared with the self-regulated complaints machinery operated by lawyers or doctors or bankers, the PCC is now pretty good. </p> <p>Wakeham's next claim, though, goes too far. He asserts: 'The PCC - with the absolute commitment of editors themselves and their publishers - has changed the entire culture of British newspapers.' </p> <p>The wily old ex-chief whip has successfully fixed the politics of self-regulation for the time being. The close personal relationship between the PCC's director, Guy Black, and his predecessor, Mark Bolland, who is now private secretary to Prince Charles, effectively covers the exposed royal family flank. </p> <p>But he deludes himself if he thinks he has led a cultural revolution. For the PCC is in the business of broking between individuals with a complaint and the publications that ran their stories. </p> <p>It is not in the business of ethics. Unlike its counterpart, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, it does not research public attitudes to media issues, and it declines to take complaints from 'third parties'. </p> <p>So, if a person who feels abused by the press does not personally complain, the PCC system remains silent. </p> <p>If you put all this together with falling newspaper circulations and today's much greater media focus on personalities and private lives, my guess is that there is more invasion of privacy by the press than there was 10 years ago. </p> <p>What is more, broadsheet editors have realised that their readers are every bit as interested as tabloid readers are in the private lives of the well-known. </p> <p>A reporter from a broadsheet, not a tabloid, was clearly mystified a month ago when I said that I would not confirm gossip about someone I know on the grounds that it was an entirely private matter. </p> <p>Of course, the PCC's code has a 'public interest' clause. It is the duty of the press to expose crime, malpractice and hypocrisy in high places. But, as evidence that there has been no change in the past decade in the culture of British newspapers over the right of the individual to be let alone, I offer at random the following (half from broadsheets, half from tabloids): </p> <p>\u0095 Details of the private life of banker Amschel Rothschild, who committed suicide in Paris in 1996. </p> <p>\u0095 The revelation the same year that Joan Bakewell and Harold Pinter had been lovers. </p> <p>\u0095 Details of Glenn Hoddle's marriage breakdown in 1997. </p> <p>\u0095 Disclosures about the sex life of Anthea Turner in 1998. </p> <p>\u0095 The revelation the same year that Des Lynam had an affair while covering the World Cup. </p> <p>\u0095 The disclosure, also in 1998, that the retired and widowed Admiral Sir James Eberle had had a relationship with a prostitute. </p> <p>All of these stories will have interested the public, but which of them actually involved 'the public interest'? Answers on a postcard to the PCC, please. </p> <p>Hugh Stephenson is Professor of Journalism at City University, London. </p> <p>Peter Preston is away.</p>",

With the Prime Minister, Culture Secretary Chris Smith and Tory leader William Hague all declaring that freedom of the press is central to democracy and the PCC its handmaiden, Wakeham can say: 'There are no serious commentators now who believe that statutory controls are either desirable or practical.' Indeed, compared with the self-regulated complaints machinery operated by lawyers or doctors or bankers, the PCC is now pretty good. Wakeham's next claim, though, goes too far. He asserts: 'The PCC - with the absolute commitment of editors themselves and their publishers - has changed the entire culture of British newspapers.' The wily old ex-chief whip has successfully fixed the politics of self-regulation for the time being. The close personal relationship between the PCC's director, Guy Black, and his predecessor, Mark Bolland, who is now private secretary to Prince Charles, effectively covers the exposed royal family flank. But he deludes himself if he thinks he has led a cultural revolution. For the PCC is in the business of broking between individuals with a complaint and the publications that ran their stories. It is not in the business of ethics. Unlike its counterpart, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, it does not research public attitudes to media issues, and it declines to take complaints from 'third parties'. So, if a person who feels abused by the press does not personally complain, the PCC system remains silent. If you put all this together with falling newspaper circulations and today's much greater media focus on personalities and private lives, my guess is that there is more invasion of privacy by the press than there was 10 years ago. What is more, broadsheet editors have realised that their readers are every bit as interested as tabloid readers are in the private lives of the well-known. A reporter from a broadsheet, not a tabloid, was clearly mystified a month ago when I said that I would not confirm gossip about someone I know on the grounds that it was an entirely private matter. Of course, the PCC's code has a 'public interest' clause. It is the duty of the press to expose crime, malpractice and hypocrisy in high places. But, as evidence that there has been no change in the past decade in the culture of British newspapers over the right of the individual to be let alone, I offer at random the following (half from broadsheets, half from tabloids): \u0095 Details of the private life of banker Amschel Rothschild, who committed suicide in Paris in 1996. \u0095 The revelation the same year that Joan Bakewell and Harold Pinter had been lovers. \u0095 Details of Glenn Hoddle's marriage breakdown in 1997. \u0095 Disclosures about the sex life of Anthea Turner in 1998. \u0095 The revelation the same year that Des Lynam had an affair while covering the World Cup. \u0095 The disclosure, also in 1998, that the retired and widowed Admiral Sir James Eberle had had a relationship with a prostitute. All of these stories will have interested the public, but which of them actually involved 'the public interest'? Answers on a postcard to the PCC, please.

A quarter of a century after Kelly went to the gallows, the notorious West Midlands Serious Crimes Squad began its regime of torture, bogus confessions and creative note-taking, resulting in a litany of miscarriages of justice. The Birmingham Six were wrongly convicted, and Ann Whelan spent 17 years fighting for the release of her son, Michael Hickey, and watching his life unravel in prison before it finally emerged that he and the two other living members of the Bridgewater Four had been framed by the Squad. How long ago it seems since the wrongful conviction of Judith Ward, Stefan Kiszko, the Maguire Seven, the Guildford Four. How far we have come since then. </p> <p>But not, perhaps, quite far enough. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is over-loaded with petitioners claiming to have been wrongly sentenced, and the Crown Prosecution Service remains unaccountable, prone to arbitrary decisions and strapped for cash. While science should make convictions watertight, the perception - or the reality - can be quite the opposite. The pattern of invisible blood spots that clinched the case of Sion Jenkins, the teacher found guilty of murdering his step-daughter, Billie-Jo, did not impress a number of powerful advocates who argue that he should never have been convicted. That unease, and the worries raised by the Michael Stone case, don't, of course, denote a return to the corrupt ways of the Seventies. </p> <p>There are, however, new considerations in an age when locking people up is becoming so simple. Not long ago, Tony Blair announced plans to take DNA samples from everyone arrested in Britain. Fine, except that genes are already being interpreted not only as evi dence of a crime committed but as indicative of one that might be. If genetic profiling becomes part of police investigation, then the presumption of innocence dies. The Law Commission is expected soon, in the light of DNA advances and Sir William Macpherson's recommendations, to relax the 'double jeopardy' principle, under which an acquitted suspect cannot be retried for the same offence. Fine, unless the police and CPS produce slovenly prosecution cases, knowing they can always have another bash. </p> <p>But the really iniquitous development is the promise by Government of post-election legislation indefinitely to detain people with untreatable personality disorders. Though the real scandal is the dearth of psychiatrists and of hospital beds for the mentally ill, Jack Straw has for years preferred to dream of incarcerating those who have committed no offence but who might. His success, framed in a recent White Paper, may delight those who choose not to recognise that schizophrenics commit 10 murders a year, or about 2 per cent of all killings. We are 20 times more likely to be killed by a sane person than an insane one, but such statistics carry little weight in a hot climate of fear in which we are encouraged to believe that a child-molesting monster lurks at every corner. </p> <p>In fact, British children are the second safest in the world, according to a new survey by Unicef. But even if they were not, there would be no justification for such a gross affront to human rights. When the weight of the criminal justice system offers no guarantee that we are locking up the right suspects, incarcerating people while skipping the optional extras of a crime and a trial is hardly likely to produce good outcomes. And besides, for those failed by the courts, there is still the prospect of finding justice, even if, in Stephen Downing's case, the quest took most of his life. Jack Straw's and Alan Milburn's detainees, unconvicted but 'untreatable', may have no such luxury.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer:</strong> What is deadkidsongs about? </p> <p> <strong> T. Litt:</strong> It's a boy book. I came across this book in the library on the campus at UEA [University of East Anglia]. I was looking through the American literature section and there was this book which caught my eye: The Boy Book. I didn't have a chance to read it, but it was about the death of the Boy Book. I thought, damn, I've just written a dead book, but that was probably inevitable, given the title. But it's within that tradition. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Can you pinpoint the moment you decided to write it? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> I have known I was going to write a book about childhood for at least 10 years. The first idea I had was called The Childhood Novel. It started with some boys hanging upside down in a tree and the alternative title was Descriptions of the English Countryside. It was going to be to do not just with the boys themselves but with everything around them. The countryside. Where they were. The time they were growing up in. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> I found the novel's antecedents in the 'boyhood' stories of Graham Greene, William Golding, and even Ian McEwan. Much further back, there's Kipling and the late Victorians. Was your intention to explore that genre? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> Yes - or to explode it. I haven't re-read Lord of the Flies since I was the age of the boys in it. For a long while I was scared of reading it because the cover had a film still from the Peter Brook film where the boy is holding the conch. I thought the shell was a fly's egg that was going to hatch and that it was going to be a horror story where they'd all get eaten by monster flies. That's just because I was watching too much Doctor Who. </p> <p>It was partly not to write about them the whole way through in a childish way. They are trying to live adult lives and the boys' power struggles are like those in a court of a king or with sycophants surrounding a dictator. They're to do with jockeying for position within a hierarchy. They don't just play at being military, they are military. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> But it's also about their relationships to their families, isn't it ? </p> <p><strong> TL: </strong> Yes, two of their fathers particularly. The mothers are sidelined by the boys and the fathers are judged by the boys as to whether they are adequate. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What do you think women will make of the book? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> I'm not sure. I wrote it to be honest about a certain kind of violence and that is likely to be upsetting. I couldn't write the equivalent girl book. It would be a different kind of violence, I think. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Did you always want to be a novelist? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> Well, I had the usual sort of fumbling-around ambitions. </p> <p><strong> Obs:</strong> Which were? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> Dinosaur hunter. Vet. Architect, and then painter and eventually ended up writing poetry, then writing short stories, then writing novels. But I knew it was words from, oh I don't know, 11 or 14 or 23. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And how useful to you was the UEA writing course? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> I found it useful in giving me confidence to trust the times I am living in rather than feeling that I needed to go for a subject that seemed to me 'literary' in advance. So with the short stories and Adventures in Capitalism I concentrated on writing about the year of the course. If people were wearing clothes then that they wouldn't be wearing next year, that was part of it. I wasn't worried about a sell-by date on the writing. I think that's the most important thing I learnt. </p> <p> <strong> Obs :</strong> What did you read as a child? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> I mostly watched television, to be honest. I started reading later on. The first big book that felt like a real achievement to finish was Lord of the Rings, because it is so big. The fact it was in three volumes was quite important. After I finished that, I thought, oh, I can read anything now. Also, I was read to by my parents and then I lost interest. I started almost everything, but I got bored very quickly. </p> <p>So I've read the first three pages of hundreds of things I haven't finished. I found reasons for not reading things. Like being scared of Lord of the Flies because of the cover. I had a similar thing with Dracula and I didn't read Brighton Rock for a long time because we had a disgusting school's edition which I thought would be horrible to carry around. It sort of had diarrhoea-coloured stripes on the cover. So I was very judgmental. </p> <p>But films started to get me into books and then once I started I read odd things, like the Glass Bead Game. I was very much into science fiction. Dune and things like that. Consciously I went back and read the things I should have read earlier, like Treasure Island, when I was about 25. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Who are the writers that you admire now? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> My favourite writers are generally dead. Henry James, for instance. I'm editing a Penguin Modern Classic of a Henry James book that hasn't been reprinted since he died, The Outcry. It's the last novel he completed and he adapted it from a play of his that didn't get produced. It's about the scandal of someone, a brash American coming over to buy a piece of English heritage, a painting. It's his international theme coming back for the last time. I'm quite excited about the idea of writing a preface for a Henry James book. I also like Jane Austen and James Joyce. Very solid, straightforward writers. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> In the novel, you've got these free translations of the Kindertotenlieder. At what point did they come into the mix? </p> <p> <strong> TL:</strong> I didn't realise until I'd chosen them that it was quite a large genre of poetry. The Kindertotenlieder were a version of childhood that was very different. They are incredibly sentimentalised. But the songs almost don't allow the children an existence independently. They have idiosyncrasies. All they do is stand in doorways looking beatific.

      "bodyText": "Observer: What is deadkidsongs about? T. Litt: It's a boy book. I came across this book in the library on the campus at UEA [University of East Anglia]. I was looking through the American literature section and there was this book which caught my eye: The Boy Book. I didn't have a chance to read it, but it was about the death of the Boy Book. I thought, damn, I've just written a dead book, but that was probably inevitable, given the title. But it's within that tradition. Obs: Can you pinpoint the moment you decided to write it? TL: I have known I was going to write a book about childhood for at least 10 years. The first idea I had was called The Childhood Novel. It started with some boys hanging upside down in a tree and the alternative title was Descriptions of the English Countryside. It was going to be to do not just with the boys themselves but with everything around them. The countryside. Where they were. The time they were growing up in. Obs: I found the novel's antecedents in the 'boyhood' stories of Graham Greene, William Golding, and even Ian McEwan. Much further back, there's Kipling and the late Victorians. Was your intention to explore that genre? TL: Yes - or to explode it. I haven't re-read Lord of the Flies since I was the age of the boys in it. For a long while I was scared of reading it because the cover had a film still from the Peter Brook film where the boy is holding the conch. I thought the shell was a fly's egg that was going to hatch and that it was going to be a horror story where they'd all get eaten by monster flies. That's just because I was watching too much Doctor Who. It was partly not to write about them the whole way through in a childish way. They are trying to live adult lives and the boys' power struggles are like those in a court of a king or with sycophants surrounding a dictator. They're to do with jockeying for position within a hierarchy. They don't just play at being military, they are military. Obs: But it's also about their relationships to their families, isn't it ? TL: Yes, two of their fathers particularly. The mothers are sidelined by the boys and the fathers are judged by the boys as to whether they are adequate. Obs: What do you think women will make of the book? TL: I'm not sure. I wrote it to be honest about a certain kind of violence and that is likely to be upsetting. I couldn't write the equivalent girl book. It would be a different kind of violence, I think. Obs: Did you always want to be a novelist? TL: Well, I had the usual sort of fumbling-around ambitions. Obs: Which were? TL: Dinosaur hunter. Vet. Architect, and then painter and eventually ended up writing poetry, then writing short stories, then writing novels. But I knew it was words from, oh I don't know, 11 or 14 or 23. Obs: And how useful to you was the UEA writing course? TL: I found it useful in giving me confidence to trust the times I am living in rather than feeling that I needed to go for a subject that seemed to me 'literary' in advance. So with the short stories and Adventures in Capitalism I concentrated on writing about the year of the course. If people were wearing clothes then that they wouldn't be wearing next year, that was part of it. I wasn't worried about a sell-by date on the writing. I think that's the most important thing I learnt. Obs : What did you read as a child? TL: I mostly watched television, to be honest. I started reading later on. The first big book that felt like a real achievement to finish was Lord of the Rings, because it is so big. The fact it was in three volumes was quite important. After I finished that, I thought, oh, I can read anything now. Also, I was read to by my parents and then I lost interest. I started almost everything, but I got bored very quickly. So I've read the first three pages of hundreds of things I haven't finished. I found reasons for not reading things. Like being scared of Lord of the Flies because of the cover. I had a similar thing with Dracula and I didn't read Brighton Rock for a long time because we had a disgusting school's edition which I thought would be horrible to carry around. It sort of had diarrhoea-coloured stripes on the cover. So I was very judgmental. But films started to get me into books and then once I started I read odd things, like the Glass Bead Game. I was very much into science fiction. Dune and things like that. Consciously I went back and read the things I should have read earlier, like Treasure Island, when I was about 25. Obs: Who are the writers that you admire now? TL: My favourite writers are generally dead. Henry James, for instance. I'm editing a Penguin Modern Classic of a Henry James book that hasn't been reprinted since he died, The Outcry. It's the last novel he completed and he adapted it from a play of his that didn't get produced. It's about the scandal of someone, a brash American coming over to buy a piece of English heritage, a painting. It's his international theme coming back for the last time. I'm quite excited about the idea of writing a preface for a Henry James book. I also like Jane Austen and James Joyce. Very solid, straightforward writers. Obs: In the novel, you've got these free translations of the Kindertotenlieder. At what point did they come into the mix? TL: I didn't realise until I'd chosen them that it was quite a large genre of poetry. The Kindertotenlieder were a version of childhood that was very different. They are incredibly sentimentalised. But the songs almost don't allow the children an existence independently. They have idiosyncrasies. All they do is stand in doorways looking beatific. But the children, the boys, in my book are the agents of everything that happens. Obs: Are they your translations? TL: Yes. They're quite distorted. Obs: Are you familiar with German? TL: Er, indirectly. I can read it when I have a parallel translation. It gave an overall structure that paralleled what went on in the book - the structure of the Mahler song cycle. But in a way if someone's not familiar with that they'll take the title as something that might lead them to think of hard- boiled fiction. Obs: What are you working on now? TL: I'm doing a book of short stories which will probably be called Exhibitionism, and I'm writing the next novel. I've written short stories ever since completing Adventures in Capitalism, so that's about four years of short stories. So I have almost enough for a collection now and the novel's taking up most of my time. Obs: And what would you do if you weren't writing fiction? TL: Before I managed to go full time I was doing subtitles for television programmes, so I might still be doing that, but if I was pursuing another career a lot of my family are doctors and I'm quite fascinated with bodies, with corpsing, so to speak.",

The 'save the pound' stickers handed out in shopping precincts across Britain yesterday, as William Hague proclaimed his love for sterling from a rally in Richmond, illustrate the Tories' conviction that Europe is still their trump card. Their line is hardening: Hague's manifesto will pledge not only to save sterling but to rip up the Nice treaty. However, senior Tories are privately warning that too much naked euroscepticism could backfire. For the party line is far from solid.. Candidates have been quietly told they can depart from Hague's line on Europe in their election addresses if they wish - either to rule out the euro forever, or to back a single currency. The former Tory Minister Ian Taylor, who will make a speech tomorrow urging Blair to go further faster, says his party could shoot themselves in the foot by making Europe their main issue. 'My own view is the Nice treaty should not be renegotiated and I shall make that clear in my literature,' he said. 'The Conservative Party will be well advised to leave the real battle over Europe to a referendum and get on with trying to do as well as it can on issues like public services.' Labour, which gleefully exploited Tory rifts over Europe during the 1997 election, is rubbing its hands at the prospect of doing the same again. But with two-thirds of voters hostile to the euro, will troublemaking among the Tories really be enough to turn the tide? Blair's best hope is the private polling showing that given a choice between joining the euro and leaving the EU altogether, half of voters back the single currency. Even BFS admits opposition is 'not as firm as the Tories think': Labour will do everything it can to confuse the anti-single currency campaign with the anti-EU fringe. But Cummings warns that the phoney battle over Nice should lull no-one into a false sense of security. 'The Tories messed that one up enormously,' he says. 'This time, we'll get it right.'

Previously, it was thought there were about 120,000 to 150,000 genes, single pieces of DNA that controlled the manufacture of proteins, the building blocks of our cells. Then Venter and his team of researchers, having studied preliminary results of sequencing data, decided to downgrade the number to around 80,000. </p> <p>'The day after we published I got this call from the head of a leading biotechnology company,' says Venter. 'He was cursing and swearing and using all sorts of obscenities about my company and about myself.' </p> <p>Venter calmed him down and asked the company chief's problem. 'You've just announced there are only 80,000 human genes, and I've just done a deal with SmithKline Beecham. I've already agreed to sell them 100,000 genes - where I am supposed to get the rest, you bastard.' </p> <p>The biotech chief has since died, which may be fortunate - for the news that the researchers have now reduced that number even further to around 30,000 would have probably turned him to violence. </p> <p>And so could the rest of the biotechnology, we might suppose. Their industry is based on isolating genes that go wrong in our bodies, so they create drugs to tackle the problem. In one blow, genetics have cut their output by a third, it would seem. </p> <p>In fact, most companies remain sanguine. The discovery that humans possess a limited genome means they simply have a more manageable set of targets. 'Let's face it, 30,000 potential new drugs is not a bad potential,' said one pharmaceutical chief. </p> <p>In any case, the really critical implication of the discovery still lies with the door that geneticists have opened on the environmental influences of our behaviour, our personalities and our health, and for the critical blow it strikes the idea of biological determinism. </p> <p>For the past decade, the public has witnessed a rising epidemic of tales of discoveries of genes that dispose humanity to homosexuality, to alcoholism, to political persuasion, to running ability, and to artistic taste. </p> <p>The 'discovery' of the gay gene is good example. Allegedly isolated by Dean Hamer and colleagues on the human X-chromosome, this DNA slice is supposedly inherited from mothers and passed on so that some of their sons prefer Kylie Minogue and Judy Garland. </p> <p>But even before yesterday's revelations by Venter, scientists had stopped believing in the gay gene. Yet belief in its existence still persists among the public. The assault on biological determinism that geneticists have now triggered will be timely, if nothing else, in showing the notion of inherited homosexuality was a myth, and that human nature is a lot more complex and intriguing than determinists have given it credit for. </p> <p>Even more importantly, the discovery has critical implications for our understanding of idea of free will. </p> <p>It has become increasingly fashionable for individuals - particularly in the United States - to blame actions and crimes on the influence of their genes. Consider the following story. A young American woman, Glenda Sue Caldwell, was convicted of killing her child and was jailed for life. </p> <p>Only later did she begin to display the symptoms of Huntington's Disease, an inherited brain disorder that produces horrific delusions and uncontrolled movements. Claiming she was a victim of her genes, the woman was cleared on appeal. </p> <p>Since then, several other US defendants accused of violent crimes have argued that they too were innocent victims of their genes. They were not responsible for their actions. Their genes were. None of these people has yet succeeded in persuading courts of their innocence and their genes' guilt. Most lawyers felt such an outcome was nevertheless inevitable. </p> <p>In other words, genetic predestination could soon have been used to excuse murder or robbery - if it had not been for this discovery that we lack the genes to thus dispose us! </p> <p>The complex relationship between genes and the environment was also illustrated by conference delegate Kevin Davies, author of The Sequence , the story of the human genome race which is to be published this week by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. </p> <p>'There has been a recent study on perfect pitch, the ability to know the absolute pitch of a musical note, that strongly suggests that is acquired through the inheritance of a single gene. </p> <p>'That may sound like a clear-cut piece of biological determinism. However, there is a crucial corollary - you have to be exposed to early musical training for the ability to materialise. In other words, even in seemingly simple inherited abilities, nurture has a role to play.' </p> <p>And then there is the case quoted by Venter. 'Everyone talks about a gene for this and that. But it is not like that. Take the example of colon cancer. People say there is a gene that predisposes us to the disease. And certainly it runs in families. It is caused by an inherited weakness in one gene that controls DNA repair in other genes. </p> <p>'But that gene is found in cells in every part of the body. However, it is only the colon where we find all sorts of toxins and bacteria that provides the harsh circumstances that final causes that gene to finally break down and for cancer to spread.' </p> <p>In short, it is not a colon cancer gene but a gene that affects our ability to respond to the environment. And that, says Venter, is what human nature is all about.</p>",

Only later did she begin to display the symptoms of Huntington's Disease, an inherited brain disorder that produces horrific delusions and uncontrolled movements. Claiming she was a victim of her genes, the woman was cleared on appeal. Since then, several other US defendants accused of violent crimes have argued that they too were innocent victims of their genes. They were not responsible for their actions. Their genes were. None of these people has yet succeeded in persuading courts of their innocence and their genes' guilt. Most lawyers felt such an outcome was nevertheless inevitable. In other words, genetic predestination could soon have been used to excuse murder or robbery - if it had not been for this discovery that we lack the genes to thus dispose us! The complex relationship between genes and the environment was also illustrated by conference delegate Kevin Davies, author of The Sequence , the story of the human genome race which is to be published this week by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. 'There has been a recent study on perfect pitch, the ability to know the absolute pitch of a musical note, that strongly suggests that is acquired through the inheritance of a single gene. 'That may sound like a clear-cut piece of biological determinism. However, there is a crucial corollary - you have to be exposed to early musical training for the ability to materialise. In other words, even in seemingly simple inherited abilities, nurture has a role to play.' And then there is the case quoted by Venter. 'Everyone talks about a gene for this and that. But it is not like that. Take the example of colon cancer. People say there is a gene that predisposes us to the disease. And certainly it runs in families. It is caused by an inherited weakness in one gene that controls DNA repair in other genes. 'But that gene is found in cells in every part of the body. However, it is only the colon where we find all sorts of toxins and bacteria that provides the harsh circumstances that final causes that gene to finally break down and for cancer to spread.' In short, it is not a colon cancer gene but a gene that affects our ability to respond to the environment. And that, says Venter, is what human nature is all about.",

      "body": "<p>Scientists have made a radical breakthrough in our understanding of human behaviour with the discovery that we possess far fewer genes than previously thought. </p> <p>The discovery of our meagre gene numbers - by two major groups of international scientists - reveals that environmental influences are vastly more powerful in shaping the way humans act. </p> <p>Their analysis of the first human genetic map - known as the genome - shows that we have as few as 30,000 genes, the blueprints for brain and body cells. This is a far lower total than expected, and dramatically undermines claims that human beings are prisoners of their genes. </p> <p>Some biologists claim that there are individual genes shaping behaviour patterns, ranging from sexual preferences to criminality, and even including political preference. But one of the scientists behind this weekend's revelations said yesterday that the new evidence demolished such claims. </p> <p>'We simply do not have enough genes for this idea of biological determinism to be right,' said Dr Craig Venter, the US scientist whose company Celera was a major player in the sequencing project. 'The wonderful diversity of the human species is not hard-wired in our genetic code. Our environments are critical.' </p> <p>Venter was speaking yesterday on the eve of the publication of the first analysis of the human genome sequence in science journals this week. Nature magazine is scheduled to outline the discoveries made by the publicly-funded venture that was spearheaded by the US government and the UK Wellcome Trust's Sanger Centre. </p> <p>The Observer has found that both teams' analysis of the first draft of the genome - completed to considerable public fanfare last June - has uncovered the same sensa tional, unexpected picture. It was anticipated the genome project would show that humans possess 100,000 to 150,000 genes. Both teams have now found the true figure is probably less than a quarter of this number. </p> <p>In the case of the public US-UK project, scientists have found a range of between 30,000 and 40,000 genes. Celera scientists have found 26,000 to 38,000 genes. 'It is good to have a rough agreement between the two sides. Certainly, it shows that there are far fewer genes than anyone imagined,' said Venter. </p> <p>The crucial point about the low figure is that it raises serious problems for scientists trying to explain the complexity of the human species. </p> <p>'When we sequenced the first genome of a living crea ture - the fruit fly - we found it had about 13,000 genes, and we all thought, well we are much bigger and more complicated and so we must have a lot more genes. Now we find that we only have about twice what they have. It makes it a bit difficult to explain the human constitution.' </p> <p>This problem is further exacerbated by studies of individual genes that have been carried out by the two teams. These analyses reveal there has been a startling degree of gene conservation over the past 600 million years of evolution on Earth. </p> <p>'In many cases, we have found that humans have exactly the same genes as rats, mice, cats, dogs and even fruit flies,' said Venter. 'Take the gene PAX-6. We have found that when it is damaged, eyes will not form. You can take a human gene, insert it in fruit flies and the vision of their offspring will be restored.' </p> <p>It is only when scientists looked at the way these genes are switched on and made to manufacture proteins that they could see a significant difference between various mammalian species. The key difference lies in the manner in which human genes are regulated in response to environmental stimulation compared with other animals. </p> <p>As to differences between humans, the Celera team calculates that of the three billion DNA letters that make up our genes, only 10,000 of them account for the differences between any two individuals. 'Really we are just identical twins,' Venter said. 'But like all twins and brothers and sisters, we are all really different in the way we respond to the environment.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scientists have made a radical breakthrough in our understanding of human behaviour with the discovery that we possess far fewer genes than previously thought. The discovery of our meagre gene numbers - by two major groups of international scientists - reveals that environmental influences are vastly more powerful in shaping the way humans act. Their analysis of the first human genetic map - known as the genome - shows that we have as few as 30,000 genes, the blueprints for brain and body cells. This is a far lower total than expected, and dramatically undermines claims that human beings are prisoners of their genes. Some biologists claim that there are individual genes shaping behaviour patterns, ranging from sexual preferences to criminality, and even including political preference. But one of the scientists behind this weekend's revelations said yesterday that the new evidence demolished such claims. 'We simply do not have enough genes for this idea of biological determinism to be right,' said Dr Craig Venter, the US scientist whose company Celera was a major player in the sequencing project. 'The wonderful diversity of the human species is not hard-wired in our genetic code. Our environments are critical.' Venter was speaking yesterday on the eve of the publication of the first analysis of the human genome sequence in science journals this week. Nature magazine is scheduled to outline the discoveries made by the publicly-funded venture that was spearheaded by the US government and the UK Wellcome Trust's Sanger Centre. The Observer has found that both teams' analysis of the first draft of the genome - completed to considerable public fanfare last June - has uncovered the same sensa tional, unexpected picture. It was anticipated the genome project would show that humans possess 100,000 to 150,000 genes. Both teams have now found the true figure is probably less than a quarter of this number. In the case of the public US-UK project, scientists have found a range of between 30,000 and 40,000 genes. Celera scientists have found 26,000 to 38,000 genes. 'It is good to have a rough agreement between the two sides. Certainly, it shows that there are far fewer genes than anyone imagined,' said Venter. The crucial point about the low figure is that it raises serious problems for scientists trying to explain the complexity of the human species. 'When we sequenced the first genome of a living crea ture - the fruit fly - we found it had about 13,000 genes, and we all thought, well we are much bigger and more complicated and so we must have a lot more genes. Now we find that we only have about twice what they have. It makes it a bit difficult to explain the human constitution.' This problem is further exacerbated by studies of individual genes that have been carried out by the two teams. These analyses reveal there has been a startling degree of gene conservation over the past 600 million years of evolution on Earth. 'In many cases, we have found that humans have exactly the same genes as rats, mice, cats, dogs and even fruit flies,' said Venter. 'Take the gene PAX-6. We have found that when it is damaged, eyes will not form. You can take a human gene, insert it in fruit flies and the vision of their offspring will be restored.' It is only when scientists looked at the way these genes are switched on and made to manufacture proteins that they could see a significant difference between various mammalian species. The key difference lies in the manner in which human genes are regulated in response to environmental stimulation compared with other animals. As to differences between humans, the Celera team calculates that of the three billion DNA letters that make up our genes, only 10,000 of them account for the differences between any two individuals. 'Really we are just identical twins,' Venter said. 'But like all twins and brothers and sisters, we are all really different in the way we respond to the environment.'",

      "bodyText": "The famous Iberian fighting bull is threatened by mad cow disease, although no case has ever been found among these privileged animals, which spend their first four years running wild and feeding on grass, hay and vegetable proteins. EU regulations to control the disease require the testing of all cattle aged above 30 months before their meat can be sold. Breeders say that because the compensation scheme is too slow and cumbersome, carcasses of bulls which perish in the 'moment of truth' will have to be destroyed. They fear the loss of income from the sale of the carcasses - the meat is a prized ingredient in local stews - will be destabilising. More than 40,000 fighting bulls are killed every year, yielding meat worth about \u00a37 million. It is feared 80 per cent of Spain's bull-fighting fairs, which take place in small towns and villages in places such as Ajalvir, a village north-east of Madrid, could disappear this year. 'We cannot continue things as they are,' said Jaime Sebastian de Erice, secretary-general of the Union of Breeders of Fighting Bulls.

      "body": "<p>Ariel Sharon, the new Israeli Prime Minister, moved yesterday to unify a divided Israel and mollify world opinion by making a dramatic bid to woo senior left-wing figures into his government.</p> <p>Sharon has made it known that he wants Shimon Peres, the veteran statesman and Nobel Peace Prize winner, as Foreign Minister. Though he has not formally offered Peres the job, there have been contacts through intermediaries, say senior aides close to the hawkish former general.</p> <p>Sharon has already invited Ehud Barak, the man he defeated in last week's elections, to be Defence Minister in a government of national unity with representatives of Sharon's right-wing Likud Party and Barak's centre-left Labour Party in his Cabinet.</p> <p>Appointing Peres would send a clear message that the new leader is genuinely interested in concluding some kind of peace deal with the Palestinians, despite his consistently hardline rhetoric.</p> <p>Yesterday fierce gun bat tles in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip continued. An 18-year-old Palestinian wounded in a clash with Israeli soldiers near Bethlehem was critically ill. The four- month-old uprising has now killed nearly 400 people, the vast majority of them Palestinian.</p> <p>Peres was one of the architects of the 1993 Oslo agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Sharon has previously declared that the peace process started then by Peres 'is dead'. But one Western diplomat said yesterday: 'The offer - and any appointment - would indicate there is some flicker of life in it yet.'</p> <p>Peres, a former prime minister who many thought might have beaten Sharon if he had stood for office, has hinted he might accept a job from the right-winger. 'I am convinced Sharon wants peace,' he told Israeli television.</p> <p>Sharon's moves are politically acute. If he is to form a functioning government he needs allies in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. Without them he may not last more than a few months in power. An alliance with the centre-Left would prevent him having to rely on unstable right-wing and religious parties.</p> <p>Sharon telephoned Yasser Arafat, President of the Palestinian Authority, on Friday and is reported to have expressed a desire to seek peace and to ease the economic plight of the Palestinian population. However, he insisted the Palestinians must curb their violent demonstrations against Israeli rule and rein in militants before any talks could take place.</p> <p>A Sharon aide, however, yesterday denied reports that the former general had arranged a meeting with Arafat. 'He is sticking to his position that Israel should not negotiate under fire,' the aide said.</p> <p>Barak, who suffered one of the heaviest defeats in Israeli political history, has not yet rejected his former opponent's offer, though he announced afterwards that he was leaving politics.</p> <p>Observers have welcomed Sharon's apparent willingness to deal with the Israeli Left. Arab leaders are deeply concerned about the election of a man they instantly associate with the massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila in Lebanon in 1982 and the development of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories. To them, any sign of moderation is significant.</p> <p>'We are watching his attitude and actions very carefully,' Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary-general of the Arab League, said yesterday. 'If he follows the same attitude we know, we are heading for a disaster. Israel will not be spared and will suffer as the area will suffer.'</p> <p>The stance of the new American administration will be critical. General Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, has announced that his first overseas trip will be a tour of the Middle East. The choice shows the importance of the region to Washington. However, his itinerary, which includes Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, shows a change in emphasis. The hands-on diplomacy favoured by Bill Clinton is to be replaced by a broader regional approach and a tougher enforcement of security policy.</p> <p>President George W. Bush has been warned by intelligence chiefs that Osama bin Laden, the alleged terrorist mastermind, is mobilising for new campaigns against American targets.</p> <p>There are also reports of new links between the Afghan-based Saudi dissident and militants from the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Hizbollah groups.</p> <p>Another key US priority is dealing with Saddam Hus sein, whose grip on power in Iraq appears as strong as ever. The dictator's prestige in the Arab world has been hugely boosted by his belligerent support for the Palestinian intifada. His popular threats to wage war on Israel have undermined more moderate leaders.</p> <p>Though Bush has made it clear he expects Israel and the Palestinians to make pro-gress without any continuous US involvement, Sharon's victory will push him to formulate Middle East policy faster than he had desired.</p> <p><b>Graphic</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,434653,00.html\">Election results</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,434747,00.html\">07.02.2001, world dispatch: Sharon has a mountain to climb</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434707,00.html\">07.02.2001: World offers Sharon a wary welcome</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434655,00.html\">07.02.2001, comment: Despair as usual for Palestinians</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434709,00.html\">07.02.2001: What the Israeli papers say</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434600,00.html\">07.02.2001: End of road for humiliated Barak</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434608,00.html \">07.02.2001: Israel gives up on peace with Sharon victory</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434602,00.html \">07.02.2001: Comment: Israel's dark hour</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434655,00.html \">07.02.2001: Despair as usual for Palestinians</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434618,00.html \">07.02.2001: Sharon in his own words</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434659,00.html\">Read the full text of Sharon's victory speech</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381501,00.html \">Timeline</a><br></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7edef/0\">Talk to Guardian policy editor Jonathan Freedland, 3.30pm today</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Video</b><br> <a href=\" http://play.rbn.com/?url=ap/nynyt/g2demand/0206israel_sharon.rm&amp;proto=dual\" target=\"_new\">Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0206goldenberg.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: 'Barak promised peace and delivered an uprising' (2mins 53)</a><br><a href=\" http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0112goldenberg2.ra \">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35)</a></p> <p><b>Key players</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433318,00.html\">Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,378609,00.html\">Ehud Barak: the main loser</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381921,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine'</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\" http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105109,00.html\" target=\"_new\">15.05.1948: Jewish state is born</a><br> <a href=\" http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105125,00.html\" target=\"_new\">19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Office of the Israeli Prime Minister</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00pq0\" target=\"_new\">Peace process: reference documents in full</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/knesset\" target=\"_new\">Israeli Knesset</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.4321.co.il/no\" target=\"_new\">Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a></p>",

The findings contradict the conventional wisdom that drug-taking is most prevalent among anxious or insecure youth looking for an escape from poor conditions or a way to feel better about themselves. Instead, up to 27 per cent of young people with high self-esteem had used illicit substances compared with only 20 per cent of their less self-confident peers. Experts say the new research means an overhaul of drug education programmes is necessary. The survey of 15,000 children aged 14 and 15 was conducted by the respected Schools Health Education Unit (SHEU) in Exeter. On most occasions the drug tried was cannabis, though solvents and amphetamines also featured in responses, said David Regis, who led the research team. 'Unfortunately the results blow a hole in the simple moral fable that young people are led into the paths of righteousness by high self-esteem,' he said. Two factors are thought to explain the results. More confident children are more likely to be sociable, have more money and thus have more opportunity to experiment with drugs. And they are also often more willing to indulge in 'risk-taking' activities, ranging from extreme sports to class-A drugs. Research reveals that though youngsters who describe themselves as 'experimental' cigarette smokers often have low self-esteem, those who call themselves 'committed' smokers have self-esteem levels as high or higher than average.

The Criminal Cases Review Commission is over-loaded with petitioners claiming to have been wrongly sentenced, and the Crown Prosecution Service remains unaccountable, prone to arbitrary decisions and strapped for cash. While science should make convictions watertight, the perception - or the reality - can be quite the opposite. The pattern of invisible blood spots that clinched the case of Sion Jenkins, the teacher found guilty of murdering his step-daughter, Billie-Jo, did not impress a number of powerful advocates who argue that he should never have been convicted.

Not long ago, Tony Blair announced plans to take DNA samples from everyone arrested in Britain. Fine, except that genes are already being interpreted not only as evi dence of a crime committed but as indicative of one that might be. If genetic profiling becomes part of police investigation, then the presumption of innocence dies. The Law Commission is expected soon, in the light of DNA advances and Sir William Macpherson's recommendations, to relax the 'double jeopardy' principle, under which an acquitted suspect cannot be retried for the same offence. Fine, unless the police and CPS produce slovenly prosecution cases, knowing they can always have another bash.</p> <p>But the really iniquitous development is the promise by Government of post-election legislation indefinitely to detain people with untreatable personality disorders. Though the real scandal is the dearth of psychiatrists and of hospital beds for the mentally ill, Jack Straw has for years preferred to dream of incarcerating those who have committed no offence but who might. His success, framed in a recent White Paper, may delight those who choose not to recognise that schizophrenics commit 10 murders a year, or about 2 per cent of all killings. We are 20 times more likely to be killed by a sane person than an insane one, but such statistics carry little weight in a hot climate of fear in which we are encouraged to believe that a child-molesting monster lurks at every corner.</p> <p>In fact, British children are the second safest in the world, according to a new survey by Unicef. But even if they were not, there would be no justification for such a gross affront to human rights. When the weight of the criminal justice system offers no guarantee that we are locking up the right suspects, incarcerating people while skipping the optional extras of a crime and a trial is hardly likely to produce good outcomes. And besides, for those failed by the courts, there is still the prospect of finding justice, even if, in Stephen Downing's case, the quest took most of his life. Jack Straw's and Alan Milburn's detainees, unconvicted but 'untreatable', may have no such luxury.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In India, as in El Salvador, Turkey and Armenia previously, grief turns to anger as survivors confront the 'unnatural' dimensions of earthquake disaster. Thousands have perished less as a result of plate tectonics than of poorly, even criminally constructed homes, schools and factories. Hundreds of people who might have been saved have died in the rubble for want of rescue equipment. The core issue is not seismicity but vulnerability to extreme but inevitable natural events. </p> <p>The facile explanations are 'poverty' and 'underdevelopment', yet there is another, more ghostly, culprit: the enduring disaster of the Raj. </p> <p>A hundred years ago, the residents of Ahmedabad were also burning their dead on huge, makeshift funeral pyres. The death toll in 1901, however, was a full order of magnitude greater than today's. Drought, famine and cholera in tandem scythed down one in six of Gandhi's fellow Gujaratis. Among outcast or tribal people, the mortality was closer to 30 per cent. </p> <p>As in the latest tragedy, the proximate cause was environmental: an epic monsoon failure, probably arising from the global El Ni\u00f1o event of 1899-1900 that turned Gujarat's 'once green as a park' countryside (according to an American missionary) into 'a blasted waste of barren stumps and burned fields'. A correspondent of the Times of India was unnerved by the vast dome of blue, cloudless sky over a slowly dying landscape: 'I do do not think I ever hated blue before, but I do now.' </p> <p>The drought, which afflicted most of north-central India, was counterbalanced by bumper harvests in Bengal and Burma. As the official famine report would later emphasise: 'Owing to the excellent system of communications which now brings every portion of the [Bombay] presidency into close connection with the great market, the supplies of food were at all times sufficient.' </p> <p>Traditional Indian polities like the Moguls and the Marathas had zealously policed the grain trade in the public interest, distributing free food, fixing prices and embargoing exports. As one horrified British writer discovered, these 'oriental despots' sometimes punished traders who short-changed peasants during famines by amputating equivalent weights of merchant flesh. </p> <p>The British worshipped a savage god known as the 'Invisible Hand' that forbade state interference in the grain trade. Like previous viceroys (Lytton in 1877 and Elgin in 1897), Lord Curzon allowed food surpluses to be exported to England or hoarded by speculators in heavily guarded depots. Curzon, whose appetite for viceregal pomp and circumstance was legendary, lectured starving villagers that 'any government which imperilled the financial position of India in the interests of prodigal philanthropy would be open to serious criticism; but any government which by indiscriminate alms-giving weakened the fibre and demoralised the self-reliance of the population, would be guilty of a public crime'. </p> <p>Vaughan Nash of the Manchester Guardian and Louis Klopsch of the New York Christian Herald were appalled by Curzon's 'penal minimum' ration (15 ounces of rice for a day's hard labour) as well as the shocking conditions tolerated in the squalid relief camps, where tens of thousands perished from cholera. </p> <p>'Millions of flies,' wrote Klopsch, 'were permitted undisturbed to pester the unhappy victims. One young woman who had lost every one dear to her, and had turned stark mad, sat at the door vacantly staring at the awful scenes around her.' </p> <p>Despite Kiplingesque myths of heroic benevolence, official attitudes were nonchalant. British officials rated Indian ethnicities like cattle, and vented contempt against them even when they were dying in their multitudes. Asked to explain why mortality in Gujarat was so high, a district officer told the famine commission: 'The Gujarati is a soft man... accustomed to earn his good food easily. In the hot weather, he seldom worked at all and at no time did he form the habit of continuous labour. Very many even among the poorest had never taken a tool in hand in their lives. They lived by watching cattle and crops, by sitting in the fields to weed, by picking cotton, grain and fruit, and by... pilfering.' </p> <p>Gujaratis are famously industrious and probably enjoyed a higher average level of nutrition and well-being than their English contemporaries before the arrival of the East India Company. </p> <p>In 1901, before the famine had run its course, the Lancet suggested that a conservative estimate of 'excess mortality' in India from starvation and hunger-related disease during the previous decade was 19 million. </p> <p>As the great Indian political economist Romesh Chunder Dutt pointed out in one of his Open Letters to Lord Curzon , British Progress was India's Ruin. The railroads, ports and canals which enthused Karl Marx in the 1850s were for resource extraction, not indigenous development. The taxes that financed the railroads and the Indian army pauperised the peasantry. </p> <p>Even in the macabre denouement of the Gujarat famine, the Government announced that 'the revenue must at all costs be gathered in', an act which Vaughan Nash denounced as 'picking the bones of the people'. When patidar farmers, ruined by the drought, combined to refuse a 24 per cent increase in their taxes, the collectors simply confiscated their land. </p> <p>On the expenditure side, a colonial budget largely financed by taxes on farm and land returned less than 2 per cent to agriculture and education. While a progressive and independent Asian nation like Siam was annually investing two shillings per capita on education and public health, the Raj expended barely one penny per person as 'human capital'. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, there was no increase in India's per capita income during the whole period of British overlordship from 1757 to 1947. Celebrated cash-crop booms went hand in hand with declining agrarian productivity and food security. Moreover, two decades of demographic growth (in the 1870s and 1890s) were entirely wiped out in avoidable famines, while throughout that 'glorious imperial half century' from 1871 to 1921 immortalised by Kipling, the life expectancy of ordinary Indians fell by a staggering 20 per cent. </p> <p>This is the catastrophic past from which Indians are still trying to dig themselves free. </p> <p>\u2022 Mike Davis's latest book, Late Victorian Holocausts , is reviewed on page 16 of the Review section</p> <p> <strong>How you can help</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\">Disasters Emergency Committee</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/giving/donate/donform.asp?app=\" india\"\">Unicef</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.interaction.org/india00/index.html\">US organisations involved in the relief effort</a> </p> <p> <strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430307,00.html\">29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430302,00.html\">29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430308,00.html\">29.01.2001: Leader - Lessons from past disasters go unheeded</a> </p> <p> <strong>Photo gallery</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,429420,00.html\">The disaster in pictures</a> </p> <p> <strong>Graphic</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/flash/0,7365,430599,00.html\">Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,428815,00.html\">Map of the disaster zone</a> </p> <p> <strong>Audio</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0129harding.ra\">Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale'</a><br>The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports <strong> Luke Harding </strong> in Ahmedabad.

Not surprisingly, there was no increase in India's per capita income during the whole period of British overlordship from 1757 to 1947. Celebrated cash-crop booms went hand in hand with declining agrarian productivity and food security. Moreover, two decades of demographic growth (in the 1870s and 1890s) were entirely wiped out in avoidable famines, while throughout that 'glorious imperial half century' from 1871 to 1921 immortalised by Kipling, the life expectancy of ordinary Indians fell by a staggering 20 per cent. This is the catastrophic past from which Indians are still trying to dig themselves free. \u2022 Mike Davis's latest book, Late Victorian Holocausts , is reviewed on page 16 of the Review section How you can help Disasters Emergency Committee Unicef US organisations involved in the relief effort Related articles 29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000 29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed' 29.01.2001: Leader - Lessons from past disasters go unheeded Photo gallery The disaster in pictures Graphic Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake Map of the disaster zone Audio Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale' The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports Luke Harding in Ahmedabad.

International health officials, drug company chiefs and doctors all expressed alarm that the US genetics juggernaut has become so powerful it threatens to force its products on the world, whether it likes it or not.

This, it is claimed, could save thousands of Third World lives. Some scientists even claim that a month's delay in marketing golden rice could cause more than 50,000 children to go blind through vitamin A deficiency. But Greenpeace research suggests a person would have to eat more than 20lbs of rice a day to get a sight-saving dose of the vitamin. </p> <p>Even within the West, a dangerous split has emerged. Conference delegates heard that 506,794 gene patents have now been made by scientists, and of these more than 9,500 cover patents for the human body, the richest vein for medical researchers. In addition, tens of thousands more patents are likely to follow, and from these the medicines of tomorrow will emerge: better targeted vaccines, drugs, and improved diagnostic tools. As Dr Dan Detmer, of Cambridge University, put it: 'There is a biological land rush going on now and everyone is trying to stake a genetic claim.' Crucially, the vast majority of these gene patents are being taken out by US companies. </p> <p>Even in the US industry, this causes concern. 'We don't actually ask what people want from us,' said Dr Goran Ando, head of the Pharmacia Corporation. 'We tend to do what we can do, not what people want.' </p> <p>Ando pointed to recent cancer drugs. 'These keep people alive for longer, which sounds great. But does it actually make lives better? There is no use in extending life if you don't extend its quality. </p> <p>As one delegate put it: 'We are getting what is scientifically and financially feasible. Not what is needed.'</p>",

Some scientists even claim that a month's delay in marketing golden rice could cause more than 50,000 children to go blind through vitamin A deficiency. But Greenpeace research suggests a person would have to eat more than 20lbs of rice a day to get a sight-saving dose of the vitamin. Even within the West, a dangerous split has emerged. Conference delegates heard that 506,794 gene patents have now been made by scientists, and of these more than 9,500 cover patents for the human body, the richest vein for medical researchers. In addition, tens of thousands more patents are likely to follow, and from these the medicines of tomorrow will emerge: better targeted vaccines, drugs, and improved diagnostic tools. As Dr Dan Detmer, of Cambridge University, put it: 'There is a biological land rush going on now and everyone is trying to stake a genetic claim.' Crucially, the vast majority of these gene patents are being taken out by US companies. Even in the US industry, this causes concern. 'We don't actually ask what people want from us,' said Dr Goran Ando, head of the Pharmacia Corporation. 'We tend to do what we can do, not what people want.' Ando pointed to recent cancer drugs. 'These keep people alive for longer, which sounds great. But does it actually make lives better? There is no use in extending life if you don't extend its quality. As one delegate put it: 'We are getting what is scientifically and financially feasible. Not what is needed.'",

      "body": "<p>Peter Stringfellow is about to make another conquest, and for once it won't be a pneumatic blonde a third of his age. </p> <p>After months of negotiations Stringfellow is poised to open his second table dancing club, in the home city of the Moulin Rouge and the Folies-Berg\u00e8res. Opening a Paris club is the first step in Stringfellow's plan to build a chain of Cabaret of Angels clubs. </p> <p>The 60-year-old Yorkshireman, who made table dancing famous here when he opened his first Angels club in London in 1995, said: 'I'm in the final stages of negotiating with a leisure group in Paris. I expect the negotiations to be concluded by 15 February.' He declined to name the leisure group. </p> <p>Stringfellow, a prominent supporter of the Conservative party who first made a living organising gigs for the Beatles, has had his fingers burnt before from running clubs abroad. In the early Nineties the US recession forced him to close clubs in Los Angeles and Miami. </p> <p>However, he now believes the time is right to expand abroad: 'This has been in negotiations for nine months. It's coming to fruition. I'm very excited about it.

      "bodyText": "Peter Stringfellow is about to make another conquest, and for once it won't be a pneumatic blonde a third of his age. After months of negotiations Stringfellow is poised to open his second table dancing club, in the home city of the Moulin Rouge and the Folies-Berg\u00e8res. Opening a Paris club is the first step in Stringfellow's plan to build a chain of Cabaret of Angels clubs. The 60-year-old Yorkshireman, who made table dancing famous here when he opened his first Angels club in London in 1995, said: 'I'm in the final stages of negotiating with a leisure group in Paris. I expect the negotiations to be concluded by 15 February.' He declined to name the leisure group. Stringfellow, a prominent supporter of the Conservative party who first made a living organising gigs for the Beatles, has had his fingers burnt before from running clubs abroad. In the early Nineties the US recession forced him to close clubs in Los Angeles and Miami. However, he now believes the time is right to expand abroad: 'This has been in negotiations for nine months. It's coming to fruition. I'm very excited about it. I'm also looking to open in Birmingham and Manchester.' Stringfellow, whose club in Covent Garden makes more than \u00a31 million profit a year, repeated his hopes for taking his company public. 'The City has got to take notice of this business, and I believe the plc way is the way forward.' The flamboyant party-goer, recently linked with an attempt to acquire the Oldie magazine, has tried to float his business on the stock market on several occasions. Stringfellow's overseas adventure comes as the UK table dancing industry faces a new threat from US operators with years of experience. US group Spearmint Rhino has already opened two clubs, one near Heathrow airport and the other in London's Tottenham Court Road, and plans a further 20 openings in the next few years. Other US and Canadian operators are also poised to move in on Stringfellow's patch in the near future. Putting it on the table",

There are disturbing parallels with the way the first Thatcher government squandered its first four years, and presided over a dangerous decline in manufacturing industry. </p> <p>The debit side of the public finances record is that public spending has grown by even less under Labour than it did under the Major government, with the problems of years of neglect apparent for all to see. As the distinguished German journalist Thomas Kielinger wrote last week: 'In Germany, such imperfections of public services as have become the hallmark over here would find the populace in open revolt.' </p> <p>Daily life, in private and public, is a continuum. But, in a most un-Keynesian way, the present Government decided it had to save before it could spend, and allowed an already debilitated public sector to deteriorate further. The results are there for all to see, but as John Kenneth Galbraith once said about the British and monetarism, the phlegmatic British will put up with anything. The phlegmatic British are almost certain to re-elect this government, just as they re-elected Thatcher - not least because the 'alternative' is even worse. Yet much of what the Prime Minister and his colleagues promise now sounds much as if they were campaigning to be elected for the first time. </p> <p>The other macro-economic failing of this Government has been, I believe, its insouciant attitude towards the exchange rate, and the damage an overvalued pound has done to industry. The extent of the problem is illustrated by the fact that, even though the pound has come down a lot against the Deutschmark, it is still above the levels that were considered intolerable at the time of Black Wednesday, in 1992, when we left the Exchange Rate Mechanism. </p> <p>So far the Government has had the good fortune to ride on the back of a world boom manufactured in the US. But all that is changing, and the perception of the threat to the rest of the world from the dramatic US slowdown was a major factor behind last week's interest rate cut. Such has been the belated groundswell of opinion that the UK and Europe may well catch a cold from the US economic virus that the hawks on the MPC had an excuse to get out of the corner they painted themselves into last month. Then, they were worrying that a cut might be interpreted as panic. But if everybody else has talked themselves into expecting a cut, it's not considered panic. </p> <p>To a certain extent the MPC has worried about the overvalued pound, and sometimes cited it as a reason for action or inaction. But its principal, indeed overriding, brief has been the achievement of the inflation target. This contrasts with other European countries in the period leading up to entry to the single currency. France spent years achieving a sensible exchange rate vis-\u00e0-vis the Deutschmark - in the end gaining something of a competitive advantage against Germany, which is commonly perceived as having entered at an overvalued rate. </p> <p>Now that the Prime Minister has done a rare thing - clarifying policy in the Commons rather than via selective leaks to the media - we know that a decision will have to be taken on whether the pound is fit to be subsumed into the euro within two years of the expected May election. </p> <p>This would suggest that it may be time to alter the MPC's brief, and gear economic policy towards achieving a sustainable exchange rate before entry to the euro. In any case, whatever the people decide in a referendum, we need a sustainable exchange rate. </p> <p>When I was in Tokyo just before Christmas, the President of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, told me his decision on whether to expand production in the UK (now taken, and favourably for this country) would be made after he had assessed whether Blair was serious about joining the euro - but also after assessing the prospects for the exchange rate. </p> <p>When British Ministers welcome 'the recovery of the euro' this is code for the love that dare not speak its name: their welcome for the necessary devaluation of the pound. Nissan, with a highly efficient plant in Sunderland, has been finding it difficult to make profits at recent exchange rates. And the rationalisation emerging from Whitehall - that the crisis at Corus is part of an inevitable historical trend and has nothing to do with the strong pound - just beggars belief. </p> <p>Between 1989 and 1999 (the last year for which full figures are available) industrial production rose by about a third in the US, by a quarter in the so-called 'sclerotic' European Union, and by about a tenth in the dynamic, Anglo-Saxon, Thatcherised and Blairised UK. Recently it was reported that the number of listed companies in the Midlands had fallen from 190 in 1995 to 127 in 2000, and that that great name Glynwed had essentially turned itself into a small business - not exactly, I think, what the Government's encouragement of small businesses is meant to be about. </p> <p>If, as has been reported, 'the Government's industrial strategy is based on the notion that the traditional industries of Britain - steel, cars, textiles, metal-bashing in all its forms - are on the way out', perhaps the Government ought to make an excuse and leave too. Two-thirds of our export earnings come from manufacturing. The main reason for the relatively low share of total employment accounted for by manufacturing is that productivity gains are much greater in manufacturing than in services - as economists say, manufacturing is less 'labour intensive'. </p> <p>But the Vodafones of this world are a supplement to traditional employment - they cannot take its place. Just look at how many manufactured objects you encounter and need in the course of a day - even when dealing with so called 'service industries'. The whole of the developing world, too, will be crying out for manufactured products in future years. Britain needs to stay in manufacturing if it is not to decline into some kind of European theme park - a park this Government would be none too good at running anyway. </p> <p>As I pointed out recently, it is a myth that manufacturing was in decline in the decades up to the Seventies - indeed it was the fastest-growing sector. It is also a myth that depreciation of the currency got us nowhere - such depreciation reflected the fact that our inflation was higher, and our productivity lower, than in other countries. </p> <p>Gordon Brown hopes to achieve the double of lasting improvements in our inflation and our productivity performance - improvements which, if achieved, would make the British economy's life easier under a single currency, when there would be no opportunity to devalue against other eurozone members. </p> <p>Manufacturing has suffered three periods of severe currency overvaluation in 20 years. It is absolutely crucial to the run-up to possible euro entry that the exchange rate point is taken seriously. </p> <p>Oh, and by the way: the Prime Minister's 'clarification' of the euro timetable has been interpreted largely in terms of domestic politics. But perhaps the cabinet - not all of whose members believe history began on 1 May 1997 - remember the name Charles de Gaulle. </p> <p>Our friends across the water want us in at the moment, but if there is too much shilly-shallying, there may come a time when a new de Gaulle says 'non' - or even 'nein'.</p>",

Britain needs to stay in manufacturing if it is not to decline into some kind of European theme park - a park this Government would be none too good at running anyway. As I pointed out recently, it is a myth that manufacturing was in decline in the decades up to the Seventies - indeed it was the fastest-growing sector. It is also a myth that depreciation of the currency got us nowhere - such depreciation reflected the fact that our inflation was higher, and our productivity lower, than in other countries. Gordon Brown hopes to achieve the double of lasting improvements in our inflation and our productivity performance - improvements which, if achieved, would make the British economy's life easier under a single currency, when there would be no opportunity to devalue against other eurozone members. Manufacturing has suffered three periods of severe currency overvaluation in 20 years. It is absolutely crucial to the run-up to possible euro entry that the exchange rate point is taken seriously. Oh, and by the way: the Prime Minister's 'clarification' of the euro timetable has been interpreted largely in terms of domestic politics. But perhaps the cabinet - not all of whose members believe history began on 1 May 1997 - remember the name Charles de Gaulle. Our friends across the water want us in at the moment, but if there is too much shilly-shallying, there may come a time when a new de Gaulle says 'non' - or even 'nein'.",

      "body": "<p>I have not been paid in full by Ema Financial Insurance Services for a claim I made when I had to cancel a Saga holiday because of my wife's illness. </p> <p>I booked this Mediterranean cruise in November 1999 and bought an annual travel policy in May 2000. </p> <p>The cruise started in October 2000 but on 19 September my wife visited the doctor, who said she was well enough to travel. This was confirmed by a specialist she saw on 22 September. Her condition deteriorated five days later and I contacted the insurer on 27 September. </p> <p>They say I should have told them the day she first saw the doctor, but we had no reason then to think the holiday would be cancelled. Allowing for a \u00a3100 excess, they should have paid \u00a32,544 but I had only \u00a31,662, a shortfall of \u00a3882.<br><strong> HP, Basingstoke</strong> </p> <p>You alerted the insurer more promptly than most people would in the circumstances. Ema says its policy clearly states that you should inform them when awaiting the results of tests. But nowhere are the words 'on the day you first feel ill' or even 'immediately' used, so I do not see how they can penalise you. </p> <p>The insurer says you could have followed its complaints procedure if you had been unhappy with the payment, but it now accepts you acted reasonably and in good faith. Contact the broker again and your claim will be paid fully. </p> <p><strong> Missing pension: Woolwich woes</strong></p> <p>On the advice of the Woolwich, I swapped to an accountwith extra interest. I was told everything would be the same. A month later, my pension was not been paid into my new account. </p> <p>I am now getting my pension but when the DSS sent my \u00a3100 winter fuel payment to the account, the Woolwich sent it back. The bank gave me \u00a310 for my trouble and phone calls, but I would rather have given \u00a320 to someone who could clear up this mess. </p> <p>It has caused me a lot of distress and anxiety. My husband blames me so we quarrel over it.<br><strong> ZC, Maidstone </strong> </p> <p>The Woolwich has now written to you accepting full responsibility for this muddle. it blames a breakdown in communication. </p> <p>It is profusely sorry and is sending you a cheque for \u00a3100 with unreserved apologies. It says you should contact the DSS again to make sure they have your new bank details for the fuel payment. </p> <p><strong> Intrusive queries: Firm backs off</strong></p> <p>I responded to an advertisement sent out by St James's Place to attend a seminar on inheritance tax planning. They asked me to complete a questionnaire, which was reasonable in the circumstances apart from three peculiar questions: They wanted the numbers of my driving licence, passport and national insurance. </p> <p>I could not see their relevance to estate planning so queried it. The salesman insisted the details were a 'statutory requirement'. Very odd indeed.<br><strong> GM, London </strong> </p> <p>St James's Place first told me they wanted the information to make sure you are who you say, and said you must provide identification for 'anti-money laundering purposes'. That is true if you open a bank account - but not to sit in on a seminar. </p> <p>On a closer look, St James's realised that the financial adviser who sent the questionnaire had been trying to short-circuit his paperwork. </p> <p>He sent you a 'factfind' which is the document clients complete if, after a seminar, they want financial advice. Factfinds do not normally include money laundering questions, but St James's has rolled two forms into one to save effort. </p> <p>It admits the salesman's aim for efficiency backfired and it is telling him in future to rewrite his covering letter to make it clear that completing the questionnaire is not a prerequisite of attending the course. </p> <p><strong> Tessa trouble: Paper lost</strong></p> <p>I wrote to my Alliance &amp; Leicester branch in January about the difference in rates paid on its Tessa and Isa, and asked for a maturity certificate to be made available on the Tessa's maturity date. The letter was passed to head office. </p> <p>Four days after that date I had still not received the certificate. The branch said no certificate was available; none had been ordered nor could they find a copy of my letter. </p> <p>Head office said it was company policy not to send out certificates until after the maturity date but, until I receive the certificate, I cannot open a Tessa Isa with another provider.<br><strong>GT, Llandysul </strong></p> <p>The Inland Revenue does not allow Tessa providers to issue maturity certificates until the due date but institutions vary in the way they send them out. Some make them available in branches on the day. </p> <p>Alliance &amp; Leicester posts them by first class mail the day after, but cannot trace why your certificate took so long to arrive.

      "bodyText": "I have not been paid in full by Ema Financial Insurance Services for a claim I made when I had to cancel a Saga holiday because of my wife's illness. I booked this Mediterranean cruise in November 1999 and bought an annual travel policy in May 2000. The cruise started in October 2000 but on 19 September my wife visited the doctor, who said she was well enough to travel. This was confirmed by a specialist she saw on 22 September. Her condition deteriorated five days later and I contacted the insurer on 27 September. They say I should have told them the day she first saw the doctor, but we had no reason then to think the holiday would be cancelled. Allowing for a \u00a3100 excess, they should have paid \u00a32,544 but I had only \u00a31,662, a shortfall of \u00a3882. HP, Basingstoke You alerted the insurer more promptly than most people would in the circumstances. Ema says its policy clearly states that you should inform them when awaiting the results of tests. But nowhere are the words 'on the day you first feel ill' or even 'immediately' used, so I do not see how they can penalise you. The insurer says you could have followed its complaints procedure if you had been unhappy with the payment, but it now accepts you acted reasonably and in good faith. Contact the broker again and your claim will be paid fully. Missing pension: Woolwich woes On the advice of the Woolwich, I swapped to an accountwith extra interest. I was told everything would be the same. A month later, my pension was not been paid into my new account. I am now getting my pension but when the DSS sent my \u00a3100 winter fuel payment to the account, the Woolwich sent it back. The bank gave me \u00a310 for my trouble and phone calls, but I would rather have given \u00a320 to someone who could clear up this mess. It has caused me a lot of distress and anxiety. My husband blames me so we quarrel over it. ZC, Maidstone The Woolwich has now written to you accepting full responsibility for this muddle. it blames a breakdown in communication. It is profusely sorry and is sending you a cheque for \u00a3100 with unreserved apologies. It says you should contact the DSS again to make sure they have your new bank details for the fuel payment. Intrusive queries: Firm backs off I responded to an advertisement sent out by St James's Place to attend a seminar on inheritance tax planning. They asked me to complete a questionnaire, which was reasonable in the circumstances apart from three peculiar questions: They wanted the numbers of my driving licence, passport and national insurance. I could not see their relevance to estate planning so queried it. The salesman insisted the details were a 'statutory requirement'. Very odd indeed. GM, London St James's Place first told me they wanted the information to make sure you are who you say, and said you must provide identification for 'anti-money laundering purposes'. That is true if you open a bank account - but not to sit in on a seminar. On a closer look, St James's realised that the financial adviser who sent the questionnaire had been trying to short-circuit his paperwork. He sent you a 'factfind' which is the document clients complete if, after a seminar, they want financial advice. Factfinds do not normally include money laundering questions, but St James's has rolled two forms into one to save effort. It admits the salesman's aim for efficiency backfired and it is telling him in future to rewrite his covering letter to make it clear that completing the questionnaire is not a prerequisite of attending the course. Tessa trouble: Paper lost I wrote to my Alliance &amp; Leicester branch in January about the difference in rates paid on its Tessa and Isa, and asked for a maturity certificate to be made available on the Tessa's maturity date. The letter was passed to head office. Four days after that date I had still not received the certificate. The branch said no certificate was available; none had been ordered nor could they find a copy of my letter. Head office said it was company policy not to send out certificates until after the maturity date but, until I receive the certificate, I cannot open a Tessa Isa with another provider. GT, Llandysul The Inland Revenue does not allow Tessa providers to issue maturity certificates until the due date but institutions vary in the way they send them out. Some make them available in branches on the day. Alliance &amp; Leicester posts them by first class mail the day after, but cannot trace why your certificate took so long to arrive. It will pay interest from the date of maturity to the time you received it and make a goodwill payment of \u00a325. Missing cheque: Lost Week Last November I bought a subscription to The Week for my son in California. A month later, I was told that my cheque had not arrived. I gave my debit card details over the phone on the understanding that, should my original cheque turn up, I would be refunded the excess. In December, the cheque cleared but my efforts to recover the \u00a352 have been fruitless. On one occasion, I was told that a cheque had been sent to me on 26 December. Who would be in the office on that day? DT, Bishop Auckland The week says there was a skeleton staff working at Christmas, and records show that a cheque was sent out. It cannot explain why you did not receive it. It has now sent a cheque for \u00a352 by recorded delivery and added four issues to your son's subscription in compensation. \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

      "body": "<p>Homeowners around the country are no doubt relishing the fact that the roofs over their heads are costing them less this weekend, thanks to last week's 0.25 per cent cut in interest rates. </p> <p>Several lenders had already reduced their standard variable rate. Nationwide building society started the trend last December by cutting its SVR from 7.29 per cent to 7.09 per cent; it was followed by several others, including the Portman, Yorkshire and, most recently, Standard Life Bank. Others, including the Halifax and HSBC, cut their SVR immediately after the Bank of England's announ-cement on Thursday. </p> <p>Economists expect another small cut soon. But mortgage brokers say borrowers who really want to save money should take advantage of the ultra-low discounted, tracker and fixed-rate loans available. </p> <p>David Hollingworth of Bath mortgage broker London &amp; Country favours tracker mortgages, where the interest is set at a certain level above or below the Bank of England base rate. He prefers them to discounted loans because any change in the base rate is reflected by an immediate change in the tracker's interest rate. In contrast, discounts are linked to the lender's SVR, and as some lenders can be tardy in cutting their SVR following a base rate fall, cost savings can be delayed. And unlike discounted mortgages, tracker loans rarely have early redemption penalties. </p> <p>Hollingworth recommends a Halifax base rate tracker, which is set at 0.45 per cent below the base rate until the end of 2002, giving a current rate of 5.3 per cent. The loan has no redemption penalties and borrowers can apply for up to 75 per cent of their property's value for purchase or remortgage. Remortgagers get a free valuation and legal fees. </p> <p>However, Ray Boulger of London mortgage broker Charcol says borrowers should consider discounted loans if their rates are sub stantially lower than those of trackers. Charcol, for example, has negotiated special terms with the Woolwich on its Open Plan flexible mortgage, providing a discount of 3 per cent in the first year and 1.8 per cent in the second. Borrowers can repay up to 25 per cent of the loan in each of the first two years, and interest is calculated daily. </p> <p>Fixed-rate mortgages are ideal for people on a tight budget who cannot afford fluctuations in their monthly mortgage payments.

      "bodyText": "Homeowners around the country are no doubt relishing the fact that the roofs over their heads are costing them less this weekend, thanks to last week's 0.25 per cent cut in interest rates. Several lenders had already reduced their standard variable rate. Nationwide building society started the trend last December by cutting its SVR from 7.29 per cent to 7.09 per cent; it was followed by several others, including the Portman, Yorkshire and, most recently, Standard Life Bank. Others, including the Halifax and HSBC, cut their SVR immediately after the Bank of England's announ-cement on Thursday. Economists expect another small cut soon. But mortgage brokers say borrowers who really want to save money should take advantage of the ultra-low discounted, tracker and fixed-rate loans available. David Hollingworth of Bath mortgage broker London &amp; Country favours tracker mortgages, where the interest is set at a certain level above or below the Bank of England base rate. He prefers them to discounted loans because any change in the base rate is reflected by an immediate change in the tracker's interest rate. In contrast, discounts are linked to the lender's SVR, and as some lenders can be tardy in cutting their SVR following a base rate fall, cost savings can be delayed. And unlike discounted mortgages, tracker loans rarely have early redemption penalties. Hollingworth recommends a Halifax base rate tracker, which is set at 0.45 per cent below the base rate until the end of 2002, giving a current rate of 5.3 per cent. The loan has no redemption penalties and borrowers can apply for up to 75 per cent of their property's value for purchase or remortgage. Remortgagers get a free valuation and legal fees. However, Ray Boulger of London mortgage broker Charcol says borrowers should consider discounted loans if their rates are sub stantially lower than those of trackers. Charcol, for example, has negotiated special terms with the Woolwich on its Open Plan flexible mortgage, providing a discount of 3 per cent in the first year and 1.8 per cent in the second. Borrowers can repay up to 25 per cent of the loan in each of the first two years, and interest is calculated daily.

'So much now depends on the GAR annuitants. Are they going to accept an end?' </p> <p>Various groups of members will be entitled to vote.

Under the terms of the GAR policies, those members become entitled on retirement to fixed-rate annuities of, in many cases, 12 per cent or more. With interest rates going down, it becomes more and more expensive for the Equitable to pay. </p> <p>GAR holders can also increase the potential cost to Equitable by topping up their plans. This potential black hole in the fund could become catastrophic for personal pension plan and other members who would have to bail out the GAR liabilities before being able to receive investment returns from the fund themselves. </p> <p>So the most crucial part of last week's developments was, arguably, not so much the Halifax's offer but the response of the GAR holders. </p> <p>Stuart Bayliss, co-ordinator of the Equitable Life Action Group, is a prime mover in discussions and is communicating with 9,000 GAR holders. Is a deal likely? </p> <p>'Quite likely,' he says. 'If you consider the position of GAR holders and non-GAR holders, they both need a compromise.' The deal he suggests would see a one-off payment of between 19 and 24 per cent to most GAR holders in return for a cap on their future claims. The cost would be about \u00a31.5 billion - the sum Equitable saved last year by not paying a bonus for the seven months from January to July. </p> <p>A major problem now seems to be tactics. Equitable Life has proved to be a very poor communicator with its own members and an unskilled negotiator. It is gearing up to hold the vote 'in the middle of this year'. But such a timetable could increase the anxiety on all sides and see more non-GAR holders leaving the fund and more GAR-holders triggering their policies if they are over 50. </p> <p>'You need momentum,' says Bayliss, who believes a vote could take place in April. 'If you don't have momentum, the more extreme views gather some level of authority.' </p> <p>For a deal to be accepted by members, it will need approval from 75 per cent of policyholders by value and 50 per cent by number. Trustees of company pension and AVC (additional voluntary contribution) schemes will be included in the ballot, but they can vote as they think best without consulting their members. If members give it the go-ahead, the scheme would need approval from the High Court. </p> <p>If all of this happens, the outlook would certainly be far better. But that is because the potential black hole has disappeared. The ability of the fund to perform well is a subject of debate. </p> <p>Raj Mody of actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow is a relative optimist: 'The long-term prospects look set to be back on comparable terms with any other with-profits funds - at least in the medium term.' </p> <p>Edinburgh-based actuary Ronnie Sloan is worried whether a fund which has closed itself to new business, which the Equitable with-profits fund has done, can ever perform well: 'Closed funds don't work. When you reach the end you find that there is only you and me left.' </p> <p>In theory, the last people in the fund could find that they have a handsome surplus to share - but Equitable is an insurer with a shortage of reserves. Anyone thinking this way would be taking a big gamble. A more likely scenario would be that the investment strategy becomes very conservative in the longer run to ensure that there is at least some money left to meet liabilities. </p> <p>Halifax subsidiary Clerical Medical has agreed to take over the investment management of the fund and will charge low fees. The best outcome - from an investment performance point of view - would be if another insurer agreed to take on the fund and merge it with a fund of its own so that it could take in new members once more. </p> <p>Donna Bradshaw of independent financial adviser Fiona Price &amp; Partners is another who is sceptical about the fund even if the full deal goes ahead: 'The cash injections would still only be adding 3 to 4 per cent to the fund. It's still not going to be particularly strong. It's still a closed fund. And Equitable's with-profits performance is not particularly great anyway.' </p> <p>She is advising GAR-holders to sit tight - but believes that for younger investors who have perhaps been in a personal pension plan for less than five years 'it may be best to leave'. </p> <p>For people who are thinking of leaving, a crucial time is approaching. The Equitable has confirmed that it is likely to make its bonus declaration in early March. Rather than using the 9 per cent provisional bonus rate which it has used since bonuses were restored on 1 August, it will give a definite figure - which Sloan believes is likely to be less. </p> <p>So people who have definitely decided to bail out may make Sloan's calculation and go now. It has been taking about two weeks for applications to transfer out of the fund to be processed. </p> <p> \u0095 New rules on pensions due to come into force on 6 April could affect the decision that high earners make about whether to transfer funds away from Equitable Life. These rules will change the amount that can be transferred between a company pension (including an AVC scheme) and a personal pension, and in some cases could reduce the amount by 30 per cent. The rules will affect anyone who has been a controlling director in a company over the past 10 years or whose salary has breached the 'earnings cap', which restricts tax relief on pension contributions to salaries that are below \u00a391,800. </p> <p>People with larger pension funds who want to transfer into an income drawdown scheme, to avoid locking into low annuity rates, must do so by transferring first into a personal pension, but the new regulations could limit the amount of money that can be moved.

      "body": "<p>At the risk of putting anyone off, if you were thinking of using Valentine's Day as an excuse to pop the question, don't you think you should consider the financial implications before you flex that knee joint? </p> <p>If selling the photos to Hello! isn't an option, what's supposed to be the best day of your life could also turn out to be the most expensive. Since the beginning of this year, changes to the fees for civil ceremonies mean that even a no-frills registry office do - excluding drinks in the pub afterwards - will set you back a total of \u00a397.50. That's made up of \u00a330 each to give notice of marriage, which is now compulsory for both partners, \u00a334 for the registrar to turn up on the day plus \u00a33.50 for a copy of the marriage certificate. But couples who have set their hearts on a traditional wedding with all the trimmings could easily part with more than a hundred times that figure. In 2000, the average - and not particularly lavish - white wedding cost just over \u00a311,500, according to research by insurer Weddingplan. </p> <p>This looks at how much you would pay for the same wedding held on a Saturday in 12 different UK regions and covers wedding stationery, the bride's dress and going-away outfit, one bridesmaid's dress, suit hire for the bridegroom, best man and a page boy, wedding rings, church fees, including those for the vicar, reading the banns, the wedding certificate, organist, choir and bells, all the flowers, hire of a Rolls-Royce for three hours, professional photographs and a video, a three-course sit-down meal for 70 people, an evening buffet with disco for 160 guests, a hotel room for the bride and groom and the honeymoon. At nearly \u00a313,000, a London wedding cost most and was around \u00a32,500 more expensive than the same wedding held in East Anglia (see table). </p> <p>But wherever you wed, a website devoted to all things wedding-related, confetti.co.uk, estimates that once you've added in the average \u00a3850 spent on the engagement ring, \u00a31,000 for hen and stag parties and \u00a3100 each for presents for the bridesmaids, the total cost of plighting your troth is more like \u00a314,000 - a figure confirmed by research by United Friendly, a provider of insurance-based savings plans. 'Getting married is not just a major personal pledge, it also represents an enormous financial commitment,' says Helen Matthews, its marketing director. 'Yet very few couples or parents make any provision for the huge bill they may face once the confetti has faded.' </p> <p>But in one way, that shouldn't put you off proposing because the longer you leave it, the worse it will get. With the cost of getting married rising by just over 8 per cent each year - more than twice the rate of inflation - Weddingplan estimates that in seven years' time, the average cost of a wedding will be nearly \u00a320,000. Of course, if the bride's father is a traditionalist and wouldn't dream of letting anyone else pay for his daughter's big day then the spiralling cost needn't be a worry. However, even if this is true, tradition demands that the groom pays for the rings, ceremony, some of the flowers, his own transport to the church, bridesmaids' presents and the honeymoon so you would still have to stump up around \u00a34,000. But perhaps because couples are marrying later - according to the Office for National Statistics, in 1999 the average age of bridegrooms was 30 and the average bride was 28 - a growing number are breaking with tradition by paying their own wedding costs. This could also be part of the reason more is being spent. So how do they do it? </p> <p>Julie Moulsdale, head of communications at Direct Line Financial Services, doesn't think it is fair to expect her father to pay for her wedding. Although Julie and her fianc\u00e9e, Johnny, have been engaged since last summer, they do not plan to marry until June 2002. The couple did not start making serious wedding plans until Johnny's flat was sold. </p> <p>'It didn't seem sensible to commit to a wedding while we were still paying two mortgages,' Julie says. She hopes the savings on mortgage outgoings and other economies, such as 'not going overboard on the wedding dress', will finance the bulk of the final bill. </p> <p>To amass enough cash for the average wedding, you would need to save \u00a3500 a month for the next two years. If you can't wait that long, the alternative is to borrow. A reasonably cheap way of financing a lump sum is to increase your mortgage. Even using the standard variable rate of 7.74 per cent charged by most high street lenders, borrowing an extra \u00a314,000 would add \u00a390 to your monthly mortgage payments. </p> <p>However, this is expensive in terms of the total interest charged.

      "bodyText": "At the risk of putting anyone off, if you were thinking of using Valentine's Day as an excuse to pop the question, don't you think you should consider the financial implications before you flex that knee joint? If selling the photos to Hello! isn't an option, what's supposed to be the best day of your life could also turn out to be the most expensive. Since the beginning of this year, changes to the fees for civil ceremonies mean that even a no-frills registry office do - excluding drinks in the pub afterwards - will set you back a total of \u00a397.50. That's made up of \u00a330 each to give notice of marriage, which is now compulsory for both partners, \u00a334 for the registrar to turn up on the day plus \u00a33.50 for a copy of the marriage certificate. But couples who have set their hearts on a traditional wedding with all the trimmings could easily part with more than a hundred times that figure. In 2000, the average - and not particularly lavish - white wedding cost just over \u00a311,500, according to research by insurer Weddingplan. This looks at how much you would pay for the same wedding held on a Saturday in 12 different UK regions and covers wedding stationery, the bride's dress and going-away outfit, one bridesmaid's dress, suit hire for the bridegroom, best man and a page boy, wedding rings, church fees, including those for the vicar, reading the banns, the wedding certificate, organist, choir and bells, all the flowers, hire of a Rolls-Royce for three hours, professional photographs and a video, a three-course sit-down meal for 70 people, an evening buffet with disco for 160 guests, a hotel room for the bride and groom and the honeymoon. At nearly \u00a313,000, a London wedding cost most and was around \u00a32,500 more expensive than the same wedding held in East Anglia (see table). But wherever you wed, a website devoted to all things wedding-related, confetti.co.uk, estimates that once you've added in the average \u00a3850 spent on the engagement ring, \u00a31,000 for hen and stag parties and \u00a3100 each for presents for the bridesmaids, the total cost of plighting your troth is more like \u00a314,000 - a figure confirmed by research by United Friendly, a provider of insurance-based savings plans. 'Getting married is not just a major personal pledge, it also represents an enormous financial commitment,' says Helen Matthews, its marketing director. 'Yet very few couples or parents make any provision for the huge bill they may face once the confetti has faded.' But in one way, that shouldn't put you off proposing because the longer you leave it, the worse it will get. With the cost of getting married rising by just over 8 per cent each year - more than twice the rate of inflation - Weddingplan estimates that in seven years' time, the average cost of a wedding will be nearly \u00a320,000. Of course, if the bride's father is a traditionalist and wouldn't dream of letting anyone else pay for his daughter's big day then the spiralling cost needn't be a worry. However, even if this is true, tradition demands that the groom pays for the rings, ceremony, some of the flowers, his own transport to the church, bridesmaids' presents and the honeymoon so you would still have to stump up around \u00a34,000. But perhaps because couples are marrying later - according to the Office for National Statistics, in 1999 the average age of bridegrooms was 30 and the average bride was 28 - a growing number are breaking with tradition by paying their own wedding costs. This could also be part of the reason more is being spent. So how do they do it? Julie Moulsdale, head of communications at Direct Line Financial Services, doesn't think it is fair to expect her father to pay for her wedding. Although Julie and her fianc\u00e9e, Johnny, have been engaged since last summer, they do not plan to marry until June 2002. The couple did not start making serious wedding plans until Johnny's flat was sold. 'It didn't seem sensible to commit to a wedding while we were still paying two mortgages,' Julie says. She hopes the savings on mortgage outgoings and other economies, such as 'not going overboard on the wedding dress', will finance the bulk of the final bill. To amass enough cash for the average wedding, you would need to save \u00a3500 a month for the next two years. If you can't wait that long, the alternative is to borrow. A reasonably cheap way of financing a lump sum is to increase your mortgage. Even using the standard variable rate of 7.74 per cent charged by most high street lenders, borrowing an extra \u00a314,000 would add \u00a390 to your monthly mortgage payments. However, this is expensive in terms of the total interest charged. For example, assuming an interest-only mortgage, over 20 years, the total interest on the additional borrowing could amount to \u00a321,000 - one and a half times the cost of the wedding. If you would rather not have a wedding debt hanging over you until you finally pay off your mortgage, a popular option is a personal loan. The interest on a \u00a314,000 loan with an annual percentage rate of 10 per cent could add as much as \u00a33,500 to the price of your big day. But by paying \u00a3300 a month, the debt would be cleared after five years. Where does all the money go?

The select investment policy is also a regular-savings qualifying policy. If it has now matured, he can withdraw it without penalty or tax liability, or he can draw an income without paying higher-rate tax. But he may do better waiting until he has a clearer picture of the near future. He should review his investment funds to ensure they are performing well. If they are not, he should transfer to a better performing investment, making use of his tax- free allowances. Anna Bowes works for Bath-based Chase de Vere.

There is an optional credit card and you can choose how to manage your money - through the branch network, at cash machines, by phone, over the internet, mobile phone and soon on interactive television. \u0095 The interest rate for the mortgage is 6.75 per cent per annum variable (7.0% APR). Summary \u0095 If you are looking for an all-round package that combines mortgage and current account, then IF.com, VirginOne, and Open Plan offer a comprehensive service. \u0095 If you want a current account that pays you a decent rate of interest and rewards you for having a savings account too, one of the best on the market is the account from Smile. \u0095 If you regularly use your credit card and want to combine a current account and credit card facility, then consider Cahoot. \u0095 If you want an account that offers a good all-round package and doesn't penalise you for using the telephone occasionally, you could look at Smile, IF or Open Plan.",

      "body": "<p>Most people should probably be able to find two or three things from this list to make their tax affairs more efficient. At the least, it should encourage you to think about the way you and your family plan your finances in the longer run. Some people will find several of the tips appropriate to them. But there has to be a financial health warning: reducing your tax bill should usually be a secondary consideration. Many people have been mis-sold investments because they allowed themselves to be dazzled by the 'tax-free' label. The less money you have, the fewer risks you should take with it. Most of the tips are in five categories: </p> <p>\u0095 Tax-efficient investments </p> <p>\u0095 Organising your affairs to fit your family arrangements</p> <p>\u0095 Getting your full personal allowance and other entitlements </p> <p>\u0095 Avoiding getting into tax trouble </p> <p>\u0095 Saving money by getting your employer to provide items you would otherwise have to pay for</p> <p><strong> If you do not know much about tax</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> Make sure you get your <strong> personal allowance </strong> of \u00a34,485. You should not be paying tax on income below this level. Fill in Inland Revenue form R85 if you have income below this amount and are having tax deducted by the bank. Ask your bank, building society or the Inland Revenue for a copy of the form. </p> <p> <strong> 2</strong> Avoid paying tax on summer work or <strong> part-time jobs </strong> if you are a student and earn less in a year than your personal allowance. If you cannot give an employer the right bits of paperwork when you start, they will usually deduct tax from your pay. Unless you are very organised, you might not get round to claiming back the tax. If you cannot give the boss a P45 from a previous employer (saying how much you have earned in the year, allowing the new firm to see how much of your personal allowance you have left), you should fill in form P38(S), a declaration that you expect to earn less than the personal allowance in the year. </p> <p> <strong> 3</strong> Don't get into <strong> trouble</strong>. If you are sent a tax return, you must fill it in and send it back. You can face automatic penalties of \u00a3100 if you miss the deadline for completing the form. Tax inquiry centres are usually staffed by surprisingly pleasant and helpful people who will often sit down with you and explain your situation. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Don't arouse the <strong> suspicions</strong> of the Inland Revenue. If you put down strange, unexplained figures on a tax return - income this year of \u00a35,000 after earning \u00a350,000 last year - you are effectively begging them to investigate your affairs. This is a deeply unhappy process and could cost you \u00a31,000 for the professional help you will probably feel driven to seek. There is plenty of room on a tax return to write short explanatory notes such as, 'My income went down because I decided to travel the world for 10 months'. </p> <p> <strong> 5</strong> Start thinking about the benefits of tax-efficient schemes such as <strong> pensions,</strong> especially if you are starting your career. The tax breaks on pensions mean that you only have to put in \u00a378 yourself to get a gross contribution of \u00a3100 if you are a basic rate taxpayer and your relief of \u00a322 is added. Added to this, you will receive a contribution from your employer if you are in a company scheme. This could bring that \u00a3100 up to \u00a3150. Since the sum will be left to grow for decades, you should find it has become a substantial fund by the time you retire. (See the points on pensions below.) </p> <p><strong> If you want to save</strong></p> <p><strong> 6</strong> Consider an <strong>Individual Savings Account</strong> (Isa) if you are aged 18 or over. The maximum contribution is \u00a37,000 in a tax year. There is no tax on dividends or capital growth. Isas are better for higher rate taxpayers (because it saves them a higher rate of tax), but there is still a benefit for people whose income is too low to pay tax, as the Lloyds TSB 'Tax Guide 2000/2001' explains: 'Isa managers can claim back the 10 per cent tax credit that comes with dividends and distributions paid until 5 April 2004 and add them to your account.' </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> Think about putting \u00a325 a month into a tax-exempt <strong> Friendly society </strong> savings plan, but choose a good one: some have offered poor returns. Look at the tax-free offerings from <strong> National Savings, </strong> but remember that the returns on many of these products, particularly Savings Certificates at the moment, are poor value.</p> <p><strong> 8</strong> Switch the capital from your <strong> Tessa</strong> (tax-exempt special savings account) into a Tessa-only Isa within six months of its maturing and you can go on letting it build up tax-free interest.</p> <p><strong> If you want to gamble</strong></p> <p><strong> 9</strong> Remember that prizes from premium bonds, the National Lottery and <strong> Gambling</strong> are tax-free, unless you are a professional gambler.</p> <p><strong> If you have children</strong></p> <p><strong> 10</strong> Claim <strong> children's tax credit,</strong> which starts on 6 April. It is worth up to \u00a3442 a year for families with at least one child under 16 living with them at the start of the tax year. But you need to fill in a form to get it. Ring the Children's Tax Credit Helpline on 0845 300 1036. </p> <p><strong> 11</strong> Understand that your children each have their own <strong> personal tax-free allowance </strong> for income each year (\u00a34,385 in 2000/01). But to prevent too much tax avoidance, the Revenue lets them earn only \u00a3100 a year tax-free within this allowance if the money has been given to them by their parents. It is better for grandparents to give them cash if the income could be higher than this.</p> <p><strong> 12</strong> Claim the <strong> working families' tax credit</strong> if you or your partner work more than 16 hours a week and you have one or more dependant children under 19 at home. This benefit is mainly targeted at households earning less than \u00a320,000 a year - but some people with more can also get it, depending on their circumstances. Ring 0845 609 5000 for more information. Some families can be more than \u00a3100-a-week better off. </p> <p><strong> 13</strong> Consider asking your childminder to become a <strong>registered childminder</strong> if you qualify for the WFTC (see above). Many parents lose out if a friend or a grandparent minds their children. By using a registered minder you can be \u00a370 better off a week with one child, or \u00a3105 better off with two or more. Telephone the National Childminding Association for more information on 0800 169 4486. </p> <p> <strong> 14</strong> Think of starting a <strong> stakeholder pension</strong> in your child's name when they start in April. There is no minimum age or earnings requirement. The maximum payment a year is \u00a33,600 gross. (See the points on pensions below.) </p> <p><strong> 15</strong> Look into the possibility of buying a <strong> house</strong> if your child needs somewhere to live at university. If you can trust them, you could buy the house in their name so that rent received from other tenants goes towards their personal allowance each year and you do not 'suffer' a cap ital gain to incur tax when you sell. They can also take advantage of the 'Rent a Room scheme' (see 'If you have rental property'). </p> <p><strong> 16</strong> Set up your<strong> nanny</strong> as a 'one-person personal service company' rather than an employee. You can save \u00a32,500 this way on a net annual income for your nanny of \u00a311,700. (See page 6 of Cash section on 14 January 2001.) You can now be fined up to \u00a35,000 if you pay cash in hand. </p> <p><strong> If you are married</strong></p> <p><strong>17</strong> Use your ability to <strong> transfer assets </strong> between spouses tax-free. There are many examples of husbands paying higher-rate tax, while the wife's personal allowance is unused. This is not efficient. If some investments were put in her name, the tax bill for the household would be reduced. Transfers of assets can be made between spouses without attracting capital gains tax. </p> <p> <strong> 18</strong> Do some <strong> inheritance tax planning</strong>. (For more information, see below.) One of the great tax advantages of marriage comes only when you die! There is no inheritance tax on assets left to a spouse. Paul Falvey of Grant Thornton advises wealthy couples to leave only up to the individual IHT tax-free threshold (currently \u00a3234,000) to their children and then to leave the surplus to the spouse. 'You use up both spouses' exemptions in this way,' he says. </p> <p> <strong> If you want to build up a pension </strong></p> <p><strong> 19</strong> Understand that <strong> Pension contributions</strong> are attractive because you get tax relief as you pay in the money. A higher-rate taxpayer pays only \u00a360 to get \u00a3100 because another \u00a340 is added by the Government. If you can afford it and think you will be able to build up a worthwhile fund, you should seriously consider having a pension. If you have access to a company scheme, you are likely to get contributions from your employer - a valuable benefit. </p> <p><strong> 20</strong> Remember that you are far better off paying pension contributions as a <strong> higher rate</strong> taxpayer than as a basic rate taxpayer. This is because you get a top-up worth 40 per cent of your gross contribution rather than 22 per cent. So try to maximise your contributions in these circumstances. Consider making <strong> additional voluntary contributions</strong> if you are in a company scheme. </p> <p><strong> 21</strong> Take advantage of the '<strong>carry forward</strong>' rules if you have a lot of spare cash this year, pay into a personal pension and have not made maximum pension contributions in the last six years. This facility ends on 6 April. </p> <p><strong> 22</strong> Think about starting a <strong> stakeholder pension </strong> - or opening one for your spouse, partner, child (see above) or anyone else if you are already up to the limit on pension payments. Contributions are paid net - up to a maximum net contribution of \u00a32,808, taking you to \u00a33,600 a year gross. </p> <p> <strong> 23</strong> See that your <strong> pension scheme trustees</strong> have names and up-to-date addresses for you and your heirs. Do not forget about sums you built up in jobs you had 15 years ago. If they have your address, these schemes should contact you when you reach retirement age. You do not want all those old pension payments and tax contributions to go to waste if you are run over by a bus. </p> <p><strong> If you are an employee</strong></p> <p><strong>24</strong> Check your <strong> tax code</strong>. All employees receive a copy of this each year from their tax office, and it is often wrong. 'Your employer has a legal obligation to operate this, which gives you so much tax-free income a month,' says Maria Bradley of accountant Smith &amp; Williamson. </p> <p><strong> 25</strong> Expect trouble if you have <strong> two part-time jobs.</strong> The pay as you earn scheme was designed for people with one job and often works clumsily for those with more. You could be paying too much tax, or too little. 'Take your payslips into a tax office and ask them to check if you are concerned,' says a spokesman for charity TaxAid. If you think you could be underpaying, check with an accountant or - if you can't afford one - with TaxAid (0207 624 3768).</p> <p><strong> 26</strong> Go<strong> green</strong>. Recent Budgets have introduced environmentally friendly measures, including higher taxes for those with company cars. Instead, employees can buy or lease cars themselves and accept allowances for wear and tear and running costs when using them for business travel. </p> <p> <strong> 27</strong> If you have no green sympathies, remember the tax discounts you can get if you increase your <strong> company car </strong> mileage. 'If it is approaching 2,500 or 18,000 miles [a year], try to use the car for work enough to qualify for the lower tax charge,' says the Lloyds TSB 'Tax Guide 2000/2001'. </p> <p><strong> 28</strong> But if you are really green and fit, you can get the tax benefits of <strong>business bicycling</strong>. Employees can claim capital allowances, and so much per mile if they use their own bicycle for travel between home and work and, energy levels permitting, between one workplace and another. The provision of a cycle and helmet by an employer can be tax free. Ask first - bikes can be expensive these days. </p> <p><strong> 29</strong> Try saving tax and <strong> Getting fit</strong> at the same time. 'Under certain circumstances there is no taxable benefit on the provision of sporting or recreational facilities provided by an employer,' says Andrew Tailby-Faulkes of Smith &amp; Williamson. 'A lifelong subscription to Champneys [health club] is excluded as the employer must provide the physical facilities per se .' </p> <p> <strong> 30</strong> Remember that if you are a bean counter and pay your <strong> subscription</strong> to the Institute of Chartered Accountants yourself, you can set that cost against tax. The Inland Revenue has a long list of bodies where subscriptions can be treated like this. It will not save you a fortune but with many chartered accountants' subscriptions costing \u00a3161 a year, you could save \u00a365 if you are a higher-rate taxpayer. (You cannot claim if your employer pays for you.) </p> <p><strong> 31</strong> 'Donations to <strong> charity</strong> administered by an employer or freely by an employee are usually tax advantageous,' says Maria Bradley. The charity also gets a top-up equal to the basic rate of tax, and higher-rate taxpayers can claim back the 18 per cent difference between basic and higher rate tax.</p> <p><strong> 32</strong> '<strong>move house</strong>!' advises Andrew Tailby-Faulkes. 'Up to \u00a38,000 of removal expenses paid to you by your employer will be free of tax.'</p> <p><strong> 33</strong> Remember that the provision of <strong>computers</strong> is tax-free up to prescribed limits, which are currently \u00a32,000 for any type, including laptops. </p> <p><strong> 34</strong> Ask your employer to provide you with another tax-free benefit - a company <strong> mobile phone.</strong> Then you can also save money by getting rid of your own. </p> <p><strong> 35</strong> Think about <strong>lunch</strong>. After all that cycling, the provision of Luncheon Vouchers by your boss has a 15p per day tax exemption. </p> <p><strong> 36</strong> Persuade your employer to set up an Inland Revenue <strong> approved share option scheme</strong>. Some employees have ended up with lump sums of \u00a320,000 this way. </p> <p><strong> 37</strong> Ask your employer for an interest-free season ticket <strong>loan</strong>. If the sum you borrow is less than \u00a35,000, you will not be taxed for receiving a 'benefit in kind'. So if you borrowed \u00a32,000 interest-free (and used it for any purpose, not just getting to work), you could easily save yourself \u00a3200 in interest that you would have paid on an overdraft, your credit card or loan arrangement. </p> <p><strong> If you are being made redundant</strong></p> <p><strong>38</strong> Remember that the first<strong> \u00a330,000 </strong> of a redundancy payment is usually tax-free. Make sure that your employer structures your payment in the right way so that you receive this tax advantage (you will not usually get a tax-free payment in return for not working out your notice).</p> <p><strong> 39</strong> Think of having any <strong> excess</strong> over the \u00a330,000 barrier paid into your pension fund if you can afford to do without that extra cash. If your employer pays the money direct, it is not taxable; if you pay, it is but you then get the tax relief on the contribution. </p> <p><strong> If you are self-employed</strong></p> <p><strong> 40</strong> Claim <strong> expenses</strong> which are far more generous than if you were an employee. For example, self-employed people who are working from home can claim a share of the gas, electricity and other utility bills. There are no set rules, says tax adviser Sylvia Kalisch of European Media Ventures: 'But there should not be a problem so long as you can demonstrate that it is fair. If a quarter of your flat doubles up as your office, you might claim a quarter of the daytime part of your bills.' </p> <p><strong> 41</strong> If you want a <strong>computer</strong> take advantage of the currently highly favourable tax rules: you can set the whole cost against tax this year and during the next two tax years, an exemption introduced to encourage this country to become computer-literate. This exemption also applies to software and internet-enabled mobile phones. </p> <p><strong> 42</strong> Keep receipts for your <strong> travel expenses</strong>. Unlike employees, self-employed people are far more likely to be able to claim travel costs - especially if they work from home. </p> <p> <strong> If you can let part of your home or another property</strong></p> <p><strong> 43</strong> Take advantage of the Government <strong> rent a room</strong> scheme to take in a lodger and earn up to \u00a34,250 this year tax-free. </p> <p> <strong> 44</strong> Think of buying another property and taking advantage of the growing trend to <strong> buy to let</strong>. 'It can be a very good investment,' says Garry Spencer of Wilbury Financial Management in Worthing, West Sussex. You can set your mortgage payments on the property, maintenance and other expenses against tax. 'You only pay tax on the profits,' says Spencer.</p> <p> <strong> 45</strong> Put your properties in your <strong> spouse's name</strong> if you are letting out more than one property and your partner pays tax at a lower tax rate than you do. But you need to be able to trust them. </p> <p> <strong> 46</strong> Make sure you do not have a huge <strong>mortgage</strong> on the house you live in and a tiny one on a property that you let out. That way round, your profits on letting will be very high and so will the tax you have to pay on it. Switched the other way, your taxable profits are low.</p> <p> <strong> If you are wealthy and can afford to take risks</strong></p> <p><strong>47</strong> Consider <strong> venture capital trusts </strong> if you want tax-free dividends and capital gains as well as 20 per cent income tax relief on your investment (up to a maximum of \u00a3100,000 in a tax year). You need to have enough money to risk the possibility of losing it if this investment goes wrong - but, according to VCT expert Mavis Seymour of BDO Stoy Hayward, these trusts have been far more reliable than they were expected to be when launched five years ago. Some have paid out very attractive returns - and the minimum investment is usually set by fund managers at \u00a31,000. About 20 are now on the market, and they are expected to raise well over \u00a3200m between them before the tax year ends on 5 April. </p> <p> <strong> 48</strong> Think about investing in <strong> enterprise investment schemes</strong> if you really have money to spare and a head for risk. EISs are far riskier than VCTs, which are regulated by the Stock Exchange. Some of the same rules apply, but you can invest \u00a3150,000 a year in EISs. </p> <p><strong> 49</strong> Start reading about the various reliefs available on <strong> capital gains tax </strong> if you think you could be liable to it in one particular year. But there are numerous ways of reducing or postponing CGT - setting gains against losses, for instance, and staggering your gains to take advantage of your CGT allowance each year. It is currently \u00a37,200. </p> <p><strong> If you are worried about inheritance tax</strong></p> <p><strong>50</strong> Recognise that the <strong> IHT threshhold</strong> could catch out many families who do not regard themselves as wealthy. If your home is in your name only and its value is more than \u00a3234,000, then your estate is in line for IHT when you die. This is particularly bad news for unmarried couples living together if the property is in one name: it has often happened that the survivor has had to move out to sell the place so they can pay the tax when the original owner has died. You could own the property jointly or see a specialist financial adviser to review your IHT situation overall. Draw up a will. It will avoid problems for those left behind. </p> <p><strong> 51</strong> Think of giving away assets to qualify for the <strong> gift exemptions </strong> each year under IHT rules. But only do this if you can afford it and if you are genuinely happy to lose control of those assets. There are horror stories of parents giving away large sums to children only to see that money disappear from the family in divorce settlements. Apart from these gift exemptions - which include \u00a35,000 from a parent to a child on marriage, gifts made regularly out of your income or up to \u00a3250 to any number of people in a year - most gifts are potentially taxable and will attract IHT if you die within seven years of making them. </p> <p><strong> 52</strong> Look into setting up a <strong> trust</strong> if you want to postpone your decision about who will get the money, and protect your investments from IHT at the same time. If you die within seven years of establishing the trust, your original capital investment into the trust will attract tax, but the capital growth will be protected against tax. And, although you cannot change your mind and take back money put into the trust, you could change the names of the beneficiaries. Trusts have to be carefully written to avoid falling into a tax loophole, so you need professional advice. </p> <p><strong> If you are broke</strong></p> <p><strong>53</strong> Consult the charity <strong> Taxaid</strong> if you are in trouble with the tax authorities. Its helpline is 0207 624 3768, and it is open between 10am and midday from Mondays to Thursdays. Its website is at <a href=\"http://www.taxaid.co.uk\">www.taxaid.co.uk</a>.</p> <p> <strong> 54</strong> <strong> Negotiate</strong> with the Inland Revenue if you are being threatened over unpaid bills. Like anyone else, tax officials get frustrated if people do not speak to them - but they can be very co-operative if you do talk and present a sensible programme for repaying your debts.</p>",

But to prevent too much tax avoidance, the Revenue lets them earn only \u00a3100 a year tax-free within this allowance if the money has been given to them by their parents. It is better for grandparents to give them cash if the income could be higher than this. 12 Claim the working families' tax credit if you or your partner work more than 16 hours a week and you have one or more dependant children under 19 at home. This benefit is mainly targeted at households earning less than \u00a320,000 a year - but some people with more can also get it, depending on their circumstances. Ring 0845 609 5000 for more information. Some families can be more than \u00a3100-a-week better off. 13 Consider asking your childminder to become a registered childminder if you qualify for the WFTC (see above). Many parents lose out if a friend or a grandparent minds their children. By using a registered minder you can be \u00a370 better off a week with one child, or \u00a3105 better off with two or more. Telephone the National Childminding Association for more information on 0800 169 4486. 14 Think of starting a stakeholder pension in your child's name when they start in April. There is no minimum age or earnings requirement. The maximum payment a year is \u00a33,600 gross. (See the points on pensions below.) 15 Look into the possibility of buying a house if your child needs somewhere to live at university. If you can trust them, you could buy the house in their name so that rent received from other tenants goes towards their personal allowance each year and you do not 'suffer' a cap ital gain to incur tax when you sell. They can also take advantage of the 'Rent a Room scheme' (see 'If you have rental property'). 16 Set up your nanny as a 'one-person personal service company' rather than an employee. You can save \u00a32,500 this way on a net annual income for your nanny of \u00a311,700. (See page 6 of Cash section on 14 January 2001.) You can now be fined up to \u00a35,000 if you pay cash in hand. If you are married 17 Use your ability to transfer assets between spouses tax-free. There are many examples of husbands paying higher-rate tax, while the wife's personal allowance is unused. This is not efficient. If some investments were put in her name, the tax bill for the household would be reduced. Transfers of assets can be made between spouses without attracting capital gains tax. 18 Do some inheritance tax planning. (For more information, see below.) One of the great tax advantages of marriage comes only when you die! There is no inheritance tax on assets left to a spouse. Paul Falvey of Grant Thornton advises wealthy couples to leave only up to the individual IHT tax-free threshold (currently \u00a3234,000) to their children and then to leave the surplus to the spouse. 'You use up both spouses' exemptions in this way,' he says. If you want to build up a pension 19 Understand that Pension contributions are attractive because you get tax relief as you pay in the money. A higher-rate taxpayer pays only \u00a360 to get \u00a3100 because another \u00a340 is added by the Government. If you can afford it and think you will be able to build up a worthwhile fund, you should seriously consider having a pension. If you have access to a company scheme, you are likely to get contributions from your employer - a valuable benefit. 20 Remember that you are far better off paying pension contributions as a higher rate taxpayer than as a basic rate taxpayer. This is because you get a top-up worth 40 per cent of your gross contribution rather than 22 per cent. So try to maximise your contributions in these circumstances. Consider making additional voluntary contributions if you are in a company scheme. 21 Take advantage of the 'carry forward' rules if you have a lot of spare cash this year, pay into a personal pension and have not made maximum pension contributions in the last six years. This facility ends on 6 April. 22 Think about starting a stakeholder pension - or opening one for your spouse, partner, child (see above) or anyone else if you are already up to the limit on pension payments. Contributions are paid net - up to a maximum net contribution of \u00a32,808, taking you to \u00a33,600 a year gross. 23 See that your pension scheme trustees have names and up-to-date addresses for you and your heirs. Do not forget about sums you built up in jobs you had 15 years ago. If they have your address, these schemes should contact you when you reach retirement age. You do not want all those old pension payments and tax contributions to go to waste if you are run over by a bus. If you are an employee 24 Check your tax code. All employees receive a copy of this each year from their tax office, and it is often wrong. 'Your employer has a legal obligation to operate this, which gives you so much tax-free income a month,' says Maria Bradley of accountant Smith &amp; Williamson. 25 Expect trouble if you have two part-time jobs. The pay as you earn scheme was designed for people with one job and often works clumsily for those with more. You could be paying too much tax, or too little. 'Take your payslips into a tax office and ask them to check if you are concerned,' says a spokesman for charity TaxAid. If you think you could be underpaying, check with an accountant or - if you can't afford one - with TaxAid (0207 624 3768). 26 Go green. Recent Budgets have introduced environmentally friendly measures, including higher taxes for those with company cars. Instead, employees can buy or lease cars themselves and accept allowances for wear and tear and running costs when using them for business travel. 27 If you have no green sympathies, remember the tax discounts you can get if you increase your company car mileage. 'If it is approaching 2,500 or 18,000 miles [a year], try to use the car for work enough to qualify for the lower tax charge,' says the Lloyds TSB 'Tax Guide 2000/2001'. 28 But if you are really green and fit, you can get the tax benefits of business bicycling. Employees can claim capital allowances, and so much per mile if they use their own bicycle for travel between home and work and, energy levels permitting, between one workplace and another. The provision of a cycle and helmet by an employer can be tax free. Ask first - bikes can be expensive these days. 29 Try saving tax and Getting fit at the same time. 'Under certain circumstances there is no taxable benefit on the provision of sporting or recreational facilities provided by an employer,' says Andrew Tailby-Faulkes of Smith &amp; Williamson. 'A lifelong subscription to Champneys [health club] is excluded as the employer must provide the physical facilities per se .' 30 Remember that if you are a bean counter and pay your subscription to the Institute of Chartered Accountants yourself, you can set that cost against tax. The Inland Revenue has a long list of bodies where subscriptions can be treated like this. It will not save you a fortune but with many chartered accountants' subscriptions costing \u00a3161 a year, you could save \u00a365 if you are a higher-rate taxpayer. (You cannot claim if your employer pays for you.) 31 'Donations to charity administered by an employer or freely by an employee are usually tax advantageous,' says Maria Bradley. The charity also gets a top-up equal to the basic rate of tax, and higher-rate taxpayers can claim back the 18 per cent difference between basic and higher rate tax. 32 'move house!' advises Andrew Tailby-Faulkes. 'Up to \u00a38,000 of removal expenses paid to you by your employer will be free of tax.' 33 Remember that the provision of computers is tax-free up to prescribed limits, which are currently \u00a32,000 for any type, including laptops. 34 Ask your employer to provide you with another tax-free benefit - a company mobile phone. Then you can also save money by getting rid of your own. 35 Think about lunch. After all that cycling, the provision of Luncheon Vouchers by your boss has a 15p per day tax exemption. 36 Persuade your employer to set up an Inland Revenue approved share option scheme. Some employees have ended up with lump sums of \u00a320,000 this way. 37 Ask your employer for an interest-free season ticket loan. If the sum you borrow is less than \u00a35,000, you will not be taxed for receiving a 'benefit in kind'. So if you borrowed \u00a32,000 interest-free (and used it for any purpose, not just getting to work), you could easily save yourself \u00a3200 in interest that you would have paid on an overdraft, your credit card or loan arrangement. If you are being made redundant 38 Remember that the first \u00a330,000 of a redundancy payment is usually tax-free. Make sure that your employer structures your payment in the right way so that you receive this tax advantage (you will not usually get a tax-free payment in return for not working out your notice). 39 Think of having any excess over the \u00a330,000 barrier paid into your pension fund if you can afford to do without that extra cash. If your employer pays the money direct, it is not taxable; if you pay, it is but you then get the tax relief on the contribution. If you are self-employed 40 Claim expenses which are far more generous than if you were an employee. For example, self-employed people who are working from home can claim a share of the gas, electricity and other utility bills. There are no set rules, says tax adviser Sylvia Kalisch of European Media Ventures: 'But there should not be a problem so long as you can demonstrate that it is fair. If a quarter of your flat doubles up as your office, you might claim a quarter of the daytime part of your bills.' 41 If you want a computer take advantage of the currently highly favourable tax rules: you can set the whole cost against tax this year and during the next two tax years, an exemption introduced to encourage this country to become computer-literate. This exemption also applies to software and internet-enabled mobile phones. 42 Keep receipts for your travel expenses. Unlike employees, self-employed people are far more likely to be able to claim travel costs - especially if they work from home. If you can let part of your home or another property 43 Take advantage of the Government rent a room scheme to take in a lodger and earn up to \u00a34,250 this year tax-free. 44 Think of buying another property and taking advantage of the growing trend to buy to let. 'It can be a very good investment,' says Garry Spencer of Wilbury Financial Management in Worthing, West Sussex. You can set your mortgage payments on the property, maintenance and other expenses against tax. 'You only pay tax on the profits,' says Spencer. 45 Put your properties in your spouse's name if you are letting out more than one property and your partner pays tax at a lower tax rate than you do. But you need to be able to trust them. 46 Make sure you do not have a huge mortgage on the house you live in and a tiny one on a property that you let out. That way round, your profits on letting will be very high and so will the tax you have to pay on it. Switched the other way, your taxable profits are low. If you are wealthy and can afford to take risks 47 Consider venture capital trusts if you want tax-free dividends and capital gains as well as 20 per cent income tax relief on your investment (up to a maximum of \u00a3100,000 in a tax year). You need to have enough money to risk the possibility of losing it if this investment goes wrong - but, according to VCT expert Mavis Seymour of BDO Stoy Hayward, these trusts have been far more reliable than they were expected to be when launched five years ago. Some have paid out very attractive returns - and the minimum investment is usually set by fund managers at \u00a31,000. About 20 are now on the market, and they are expected to raise well over \u00a3200m between them before the tax year ends on 5 April. 48 Think about investing in enterprise investment schemes if you really have money to spare and a head for risk. EISs are far riskier than VCTs, which are regulated by the Stock Exchange. Some of the same rules apply, but you can invest \u00a3150,000 a year in EISs. 49 Start reading about the various reliefs available on capital gains tax if you think you could be liable to it in one particular year. But there are numerous ways of reducing or postponing CGT - setting gains against losses, for instance, and staggering your gains to take advantage of your CGT allowance each year. It is currently \u00a37,200. If you are worried about inheritance tax 50 Recognise that the IHT threshhold could catch out many families who do not regard themselves as wealthy. If your home is in your name only and its value is more than \u00a3234,000, then your estate is in line for IHT when you die. This is particularly bad news for unmarried couples living together if the property is in one name: it has often happened that the survivor has had to move out to sell the place so they can pay the tax when the original owner has died. You could own the property jointly or see a specialist financial adviser to review your IHT situation overall. Draw up a will. It will avoid problems for those left behind. 51 Think of giving away assets to qualify for the gift exemptions each year under IHT rules. But only do this if you can afford it and if you are genuinely happy to lose control of those assets. There are horror stories of parents giving away large sums to children only to see that money disappear from the family in divorce settlements. Apart from these gift exemptions - which include \u00a35,000 from a parent to a child on marriage, gifts made regularly out of your income or up to \u00a3250 to any number of people in a year - most gifts are potentially taxable and will attract IHT if you die within seven years of making them. 52 Look into setting up a trust if you want to postpone your decision about who will get the money, and protect your investments from IHT at the same time. If you die within seven years of establishing the trust, your original capital investment into the trust will attract tax, but the capital growth will be protected against tax. And, although you cannot change your mind and take back money put into the trust, you could change the names of the beneficiaries. Trusts have to be carefully written to avoid falling into a tax loophole, so you need professional advice. If you are broke 53 Consult the charity Taxaid if you are in trouble with the tax authorities. Its helpline is 0207 624 3768, and it is open between 10am and midday from Mondays to Thursdays. Its website is at www.taxaid.co.uk. 54 Negotiate with the Inland Revenue if you are being threatened over unpaid bills. Like anyone else, tax officials get frustrated if people do not speak to them - but they can be very co-operative if you do talk and present a sensible programme for repaying your debts.",

As he is self-employed, his payments are made gross of tax, which he claims back. From April this will change: payments will be net of tax, with relief added to their funds by the Government. He likes this, and the fact that he will be able to take out a quarter of his fund as a tax-free lump sum when he retires, as well as getting the relief now. But he says: 'This is dependent on Gordon Brown and his mates not mucking things up. He's not a great friend of non-state pension schemes.' Brewer is more interested in his financial arrangements than most of us, and has thought of investing in a Venture Capital Trust. These potentially risky funds have so far produced more reliable returns than expected, and are seen as for the wealthy. But some now accept investments as low as \u00a31,000, so they may become a tax-efficient flutter for more investors.",

Financial advisers predict a rash of 'asset-swapping' between couples in the unlikely event of a Tory victory in the next general election. </p> <p>The plans would remove the obligation to pay income tax on savings account and dividend income for people earning less than the higher rate tax threshold, currently \u00a332,785 a year. </p> <p>So, in the traditional Tory family, the high-earning husband who pays tax at 40 per cent would transfer his building society and other savings accounts to his wife. A lower rate taxpayer, with a part-time job perhaps, the wife would receive income from these assets tax-free. And - under the plans outlined by Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo - the wife would still get sympathetic treatment if the huge size of her portfolio took her into the top tax bracket. She would have to pay 40 per cent tax on income above \u00a332,785 but would get all her investment income below that tax-free. </p> <p>When the Tory party talks about itself as the party of the family, this appears to be a large part of what it means. The tax benefits that come through a close family go a long way to preserving family members' wealth. Non-married couples can also transfer assets between themselves, but they risk a capital gains tax liability if the gain that the transferring partner realises exceeds the threshold (currently \u00a37,200). Asset transfers between spouses are tax-free. </p> <p>'This looks as though it would benefit people with clever accountants,' says Simon Farrant of independent financial adviser Towry Law. The plans would give a new lease of life to the tax avoidance industry, since anyone moving down below the \u00a332,785 threshold would shift down from a 40 to a zero per cent tax rate. </p> <p>The plan will be of most benefit to those wealthy enough to live off investment income. Those with income from savings and shares that comes to just under the \u00a332,785 threshold will pay no income tax. That would mean having a portfolio worth about \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>What Portillo billed as 'the most radical changes to the taxation of savings in a generation' - has four strands: </p> <p>\u0095 Taxpayers below the 40 per cent higher-rate threshold would pay no tax on income from savings. </p> <p>\u0095 If income from savings takes you into the 40 per cent tax band, you would only pay 40 per cent on income above \u00a332,785. </p> <p>\u0095 Taxpayers below the 40 per cent threshold would receive income from shares free of tax. Since they are effectively taxed at 10 per cent on dividend income now, they would get 100, not just 90, per cent of the dividend income in their pocket. </p> <p>\u0095 Non-taxpayers would receive 100 per cent of a dividend, rather than the 90 per cent they receive at present. </p> <p>In his speech last Monday, Michael Portillo gave the example of someone with \u00a310,000 of savings who would be \u00a3120 better off in a year, and \u00a3740 better off after five years. </p> <p>So, even though the proposals would give much scope to the wealthy, there would also be benefits to the less well-off. Since April 1999 non-taxpayers have not been able to reclaim the 10 per cent so-called 'tax credit' on their dividend income. </p> <p>Philip Spiers of the Nursing Home Fees Agency says that many elderly people had relied on getting the income tax-free and lost out under the new Labour system: 'A lot of them didn't want to sell those shares. Maybe their husbands had bought the shares a long time before.' </p> <p>One group of people who would not stand to gain from the proposals are higher-rate taxpayers whose salaries or self-employed earnings take them into that bracket. Their tax debts would stay the same. But if a higher-rate taxpayer were married to a lower-rate taxpayer, it would be in the interests of both for the higher-rate taxpayer to make pension contributions and get tax relief. 'The only trouble would then be sorting out the finances if they separated,' says tax adviser Richard Murphy. </p> <p>Another side-effect of the Tory proposals would be that pensions may be seen as less attractive investment vehicles. Assuming that they were likely to be lower-rate taxpayers on retirement, people may prefer to build up more investments that would be non-taxable than to build up a pension fund, that would be taxed. </p> <p>The market for tax-free individual savings account would also be dealt a blow by the proposals. Only higher-rate taxpayers would need to invest in them. Although Portillo did not discuss in his speech the treatment of unit trusts, the main equity Isa vehicle, he stated that he did not want to see market distortions pushing people away from stock market investments. It would be very surprising, therefore, if unit trusts were not treated in the same fashion for lower-rate taxpayers. </p> <p>If William Hague came to power, the aim would be to have these proposals in place by April 2003.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A major disaster was narrowly averted at Sellafield's nuclear waste plant in Cumbria when more than 2,000 tonnes of high-level nuclear waste almost exploded, The Observer can reveal. Safety procedures were so lax at one of the plant's waste storage facilities last month that workers ignored alarm warnings of a build-up of explosive gases for nearly three hours. The gases were accumulating in the 21 tanks that each store 100 tonnes of deadly waste. Ten hours longer, experts say, and the tanks would have been explosive. Ministers were briefed last Tuesday about the incident, the worst in a long line of safety scandals at the plant. Peter Hain, the Minister for Energy, was informed by the Government's nuclear safety team, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), that an incident had occurred at the plant on 26 January. The NII has launched a major investigation, sending four inspectors to the plant and requesting that the owner of the plant, British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL), report on safety procedures within four weeks. 'This is an extremely alarming situation,' said Andrew Stunnel, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on energy. 'It shows the cavalier attitude that has dogged the nuclear industry for 50 years.' Martin Forewood, a campaign co-ordinator for the local activist group Core, who has lived in the area for 25 years, said:'We're constantly reassured by the Government and BNFL that we have nothing to worry about. This incident shows how close we can come to a catastrophic incident.' BNFL admitted its staff ignored alarms for two-and-a-half hours, and said the situation was 'inadequate'. It said it would take a lot longer than 10 hours for the situation to become critical and risk an explosion. It confirmed that the reprocessing plant at Thorp had been shut down as a result of the incident. 'Those 21 tanks of waste contain huge quantities of the most hazardous materials on the nuclear site, if not the planet' said John Large, one of the world's leading nuclear engineers.

Police said forensic tests and dental records proved the body parts were from Lucie, a Tokyo hostess who was 21 when she disappeared. Tim Blackman, Lucie's father, last night said he had felt a 'significant feeling of relief' after months of uncertainty when he was told the news. Fighting back tears, he told a press conference on the Isle of Wight: 'I hope that she had a glass of champagne, felt a bit woozy and then passed out.

Japanese police said yesterday they would be charging the prime suspect for her murder, 48-year-old businessman Joji Obara, with 'abandoning a corpse'. Obara, who is regarded as one of the most evil characters to have surfaced in Japanese criminal history, is already on trial accused of drugging and raping five women. Yesterday he told Japanese reporters: 'I didn't bury the corpse. The police did.' The beach where the body was found, buried in a shallow pit, had already been searched several times by Japanese police over the past few months.

'We have determined the identity of the body, and it was an unfortunate outcome for the friends and family of Lucie,' said Akira Hiromitsu, of Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department. Lucie's family, who had spent tens of thousands of pounds in their relentless seven-month search forher, were devastated yesterday. Her grandfather, Eric Blackman, 78, said the family had been told Lucie was likely to have been drugged before her death.

      "bodyText": "Millionaire donors to political parties could face a cap on their gifts amid public fears about wealthy businessmen buying influence. Sam Younger, chairman of the new funding watchdog, the Electoral Commission, will reopen the controversy in a review of the rules once the election is over. Speaking to The Observer, Younger warned that the real turn-off for voters was not sleaze but modern politicians failing to convince voters they could make a difference. However, he said a cap on donations was 'on the surface very attractive' following concern over tycoon Stuart Wheeler's \u00a35 million gift to the Tories and three gifts of \u00a32 million each to Labour from other donors. 'I completely understand the public concern about the agenda of those who might give large donations to political parties and about how parties are responding,' he said. 'That is inevitable, and the greater degree of transparency that can be achieved the better.' But capping donations - Labour MPs have suggested no one should give more than \u00a3100,000 - may mean the taxpayer being asked to stump up for campaigns through state funding, which he warned would be unpopular. The Electoral Commission, launched tomorrow, will police new rules forcing political parties to declare all donations above \u00a35,000 as well as overseeing spending on the euro referendum, conducting experiments such as internet voting, and maintaining the UK's 107-strong register of official political parties - from Labour and the Tories to the Millennium Bean Party. He will soon start producing weekly updates on funding for the main parties during the election campaign. Younger will have powers to seize and examine the parties' books, while MPs face random spot checks on election expense returns. But he says his team will not charge in like a 'blundering elephant' on every minor complaint. Younger, former managing director of BBC World Services, says he has no personal political leanings, only a mission to reverse the decline in voter numbers. 'There isn't the sense that there was some years ago that we were voting for significant changes of direction,' he argues.",

That honour, and Ellen's radioed congratulations yesterday, went to Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux, 'The Professor', who was last night due to sail his yacht PRB, the mouse to whom Ellen has been cat for the last exhilarating fortnight, into port as a filthily wet Les Sables lit up in his honour. He, as has Ellen, has rewritten the record books, sailing round the world single-handed in an astonishing 95 days, tearing the previous time down by 10 days.</p> <p>His story, an idiosyncratic mix of quiet competence and Gallic inspiration, will be told again and again. But it is Ellen's story that has caught the French imagination, and that of the world. Where the professor was expected to sail in with his boat a forgiveable mess, Ellen has been swabbing and sewing, keeping tidy throughout.</p> <p>Where the men of the race, the bearded stars, have been seen clambering manfully around their rigging, Ellen has practically been lost inside hers: a tiny figure, almost forlorn, but for the fact that her grit, her refusal to give up, have made her perhaps the first true heroine of the 21st century.</p> <p>Here, the French, conscious of her size, have begun comparing her to Joan of Arc. Chants of 'Vive Ellen!' have been heard round the Les Sables marina, where much of western France was gathered all yesterday in the rain, soaking itself in sympathy with the sailor whose adventures they have followed, with increasing fascination, since 9 November last year.</p> <p>It was exhaustion, finally, which robbed Ellen of absolute triumph. One tiny slip, back on day 80, when she allowed herself a brief sleep in the Doldrums - not the hardest sailing by far, but as demanding in terms of crucial concentration as any - after a Herculanean struggle climbing the mast to mend the wind instruments, an endless night time battle worthy of a book or film in itself, and she had allowed Desjoyeaux, 'Mich' as she refers to him, to get the directional jump-start into the trade winds which he needed. After that it was always going to be hard for her to catch up. The astounding thing is that she almost made it.</p> <p>Had it not been for her crashing into a floating container - one of many thousands dumped annually at sea - her daggerboard would not have been ruined. Even then, she effected repairs and motored on; it was only a couple of days ago, when her forestay unexpectedly went, that she knew the race was over; she could not pile the pressure on the mast without the risk of bringing it down.</p> <p>Nevertheless, she knows, as she cruises in some time this evening, hoping furiously to catch the tide-barrier in time and enter Les Sables during the evening, rather than having to wait until the next morning, that what she has achieved is beyond any expectations. Beyond those of her parents, who hardly know what to make of their driven offspring; this is not a sailing family. Beyond the expectations of her homeland, which had forgotten how glorious its sailing tradition was and how one story could capture the imagination.</p> <p>It has done so, quite simply, thanks to Ellen. Not for any false Amazonian stoicism; some of the time she was knackered, and in tears, and she shared it with people, by phone links and email, and it was this vulnerable human element to the tale which held.</p> <p>We listened to it all. Her awe as she passed the insanely high blue icebergs. Her plaintive emails. Forgetting to eat. Remembering to dream. Celebrating various landmarks with a little champagne, but pouring the rest proudly over the deck. Throwing back the flying fish which landed on her deck, where others ate them. And the tiredness; the 20-minute catnaps and the luxurious two-hour snores, and the hours and hours at the computer, planning and planning and never giving in.</p> <p>For, ultimately, and despite the fibreglass and computer design and emails and satellite strategising, this was an ancient human story.</p> <p>For Ellen, for all those taking part, the Vend\u00e9e Globe challenge was about their own body.

Mandela and his fellow defendants were charged with 221 acts of sabotage designed to \"ferment violent revolution\". The ANC had been operating underground since being outlawed in April 1960, one month after the Sharpeville Massacre of 67 protestors by police. The police had collected hundreds of documents from the ANC hideout at Rivonia about Operation Mayibuye (Operation Comeback). Under the new General Law Amendment (Sabotage) Act of 1962 and the Suppression of Communism Act, the defendants faced the threat of the death penalty. Mandela had a growing international reputation and the ANC sought to use the trial to win worldwide support and attention, hence Mandela's speech from the dock on April 20th which was delivered from his handwritten script. For example, the speech was extracted in The Observer on Sunday April 26th, under the headline \"Why I am prepared to die\". Mandela was described as \"the black pimpernel of South Africa, on trial in Pretoria with eight others on charges of attempting a revolution by violence\". The newspaper told its readers that \"the alleged offences are punishable by death. Last week he appeared in the witness-box for four-and-a-half hours to explain his stand.

But just as the women all chose to impersonate the members of The Red Hot Chilli Peppers ('as soon as the sock went in, that was it!' said Lisa-as-Lee), none of the men-who-would-be-women opted for a flat chest, either. Funny that.</p> <p> 'Beyond drag, beyond camp, beyond mere dressing up...' insisted voiceover artiste Gail Porter (and how I wished she'd joined in too), but there was no evidence of it here: everybody looked laughably draggy and camp. There's no disguising an Adam's apple, stubble and bricklayer's hands, after all - and, more interestingly, no hiding a fear of, or loathing for, the opposite sex either. Of the initial eight sex-swappers, only six were allowed to carry on the experiment into Week Two. The pair who were rejected - Helen as 'Bob' and Stan as 'Stacy' - were both actors whose alter egos turned out to be rather unpleasant two-dimensional cliches, revealing more about Helen and Stan than perhaps either would have liked. </p> <p>Helen's 'Bob' was, physically, the most convincing of the lot, but the character was 'aggressive and emotionally aloof'. 'Bob' clammed up, angrily, when asked 'how do you treat a woman in bed, Bob? Do you treat her right?'while Stan's 'Stacy' was a parody of the frigid man-hater, whose greatest regret was 'losing my virginity'. </p> <p>'Stan wouldn't let himself be a weak woman because he's a strong man,' explained one of the judges, even though Stan hadn't created a strong woman, but merely sketched a madly surrealist cartoon in a fake Chanel suit. </p> <p>BBC1's <strong>Omnibus</strong> on Nancy Mitford, screened to complement the dramatisation of Love In A Cold Climate (to be reviewed next week), revealed that although the whole of Miss Mitford's life was spent in a cartoonish Pursuit of Love (doubtless while wearing kosher Chanel, too) she ended up Loveless In A Chilly Emotional Climate. I guess the downside of a lifetime being professionally witty and gay and not appearing to take anything terribly seriously may be that when one finally does take something seriously, nobody will actually notice. </p> <p>After a failed marriage and a deeply shallow friendship with a man called Hamish ('she wilfully refused to see he was homosexual,' rued her biographer), Nancy fixated on a Frenchman with appalling facial pustules and moved to Paris to be near him. Unfortunately he wasn't remotely interested in being anything other than good friends and, shortly after he announced his engagement to another, Nancy was diagnosed with cancer. I'm sure she carried on being witty and gay until the bitter end. Indeed, on her death bed, she told her sister, the Duchess of Devonshire, that she only regretted that she couldn't squeeze in one more day's hunting. 'It was a very happy, full life,' said another Mitford gel, Lady Diana, 'but the men in it... they were hopeless.' Which was not only presumptuous but, frankly, just a wee bit rich coming from the woman who married Oswald Mosley. </p> <p>It was both a fashion moment and a cue for a bumper sticker - 'enlightened sexual beings do it with accessories'. The woman in the Kama Sutra had changed her blouse for each position, while the man was wearing the same red hat in each. 'There's quite a lot about who's putting whose hands, and where...' said the man from the Wellcome Institute, sounding archly Mitfordish, to Sanjeev Bhaskar, as they both pored over the source material in C4's <strong>Position Impossible</strong>. But despite its punning title, this was a largely sniggerless journey from Penzance to India in search of the seed of Eastern sensuality. Bhaskar seems like a nice bloke, but the only qualification for this job seemed to be the colour of his skin, which perhaps wasn't quite enough. The star of Goodness Gracious Me ('cheque please!') was clearly torn between the desire to deliver stand-up funnies or really getting to grips with his subject, and in the event he didn't quite manage either. At the Tantric Sex workshop in Penzance, where a very unattractive man called John and his 'assistant' Hannah were up to all sorts of tricks, like a saucy Paul Daniels and Debbie McGee, Bhaskar squirmed when he was urged to 'play the inner flute' and 'dance the snake awake'. That's the Kundalini energy 'snake' that lives at the base of one's spine, by the way, and you really can't fake it with a pair of old socks. </p> <p>In India, our host was far more comfortable and, indeed, affected a bit of gravitas - though I'd imagine Varanasi does that to you. On the whole, though, Position Impossible was a hybrid of a documentary: it looked lovely, but there wasn't much depth to it. A bit like the illustrations, really. After all, who, aside from Nancy Mitford, wouldn't lose themselves in a union of spiritual and sexual ecstasy without also losing their hat? </p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed <strong>The Real Erich Von Daniken</strong>. When I was about 13, I was a big fan of Von D, just after the Harold Robbins phase and right before the Jane Austen crush kicked in. It all made deliciously perfect sense at the time: well, of course aliens had built the pyramids and Stonehenge, and naturally those sketches etched into the Peruvian earth were parking bays for spacecraft, and I needn't feel embarrassed because a whopping 59,999,999 other readers all agreed.

There's no doubt, though, that whatever scams he pulled to make himself a bestselling author, Von D was given a very rough ride when he was tried, ostensibly for embezzlement and fraud in relation to his hotel business, and then denounced in court by the prosecution as 'a validity-craving, lying, insecure, criminal psychopath with an hysterical character', before being given a three-and-a-half year sentence. </p> <p>These days Von D plies his unfashionable trade at places like The Eclectic Viewpoint Convention in Texas and has just come up with his best wheeze yet: the Mysteries of The World theme park, scheduled to open near his home in Interlaken in 2002. Imagine: no jet lag, no steamy jungles accessed only by lengthy and terrifying bus journeys, just a short stroll from Peru to Egypt via Wiltshire, with a pit-stop for cosmic refreshments.

In the event it wasn't Sir Trev, but Fiona Foster who spoke to Debbie Mathers, Eminem's spun-sugar haired, panda-eyed mom, currently suing her son for $10 million for defamation.

Just a few years later he was to be seen shouting 'none of you fake arse bitches get a piece of my cake' during a birthday party, but one couldn't help noticing, however, that this threat was issued straight to camcorder, rather than at any of the presumably non fake-arse un-bitches who happened to be present, which tell-tale piece of performance sort of gives the game away. Eminem is about as much of a threat to society as was Von Daniken in his heyday and when Mathers proudly eventually shows off his plans for The Great Pop Scams theme park just outside Detroit, Malcolm McLaren will be seething in his bath chair.</p>",

      "byline": "Harriet Lane",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Before last summer, you may not have thought about Les Dennis that much. He was always there on the third channel, the chipper host of Family Fortunes, an old-fashioned game show that was beginning to look a little bedraggled next to its newer, flashier rivals. As cheesy and unreal as a Kraft processed slice, Les wasn't simply being eclipsed by the competition; he was also being gently shunted out of the limelight by his wife of six years, the actress Amanda Holden, as she made a name for herself in TV drama. </p> <p>Then in May, something awful happened. Amanda and Les split up, after her on-set affair with Neil 'Men Behaving Badly' Morrissey came to light in the tabloids. I say 'awful' advisedly. It can't have been nice for any of those involved, and the redtops' coverage of events - the spurned embrace, the trial separation, the pale bands on the ring fingers - certainly brought out the prurient worst in me. Messy and humiliating, this was a Charles and Di for Heat readers. And oh dear, how we gorged on it. </p> <p>If the summer had drawn to a close with a visit to the lawyers' office, Les Dennis might just have fallen off the radar altogether: after all, showbiz is littered with the corpses of failed relationships. But he didn't, because it became apparent that he and the missus were going to do the unexpected thing, the difficult thing, and give it another go. The peculiar consequence of this is that Les's profile is now at a career high, thanks to the dubious attentions of the tabloid press, which has always been fascinated by the 17-year age gap between the pair, and is currently daring the relationship not to go wrong again. Holden continues to take a kicking, whereas her husband, once considered irredeemably naff, is cast with patronising affection as the besotted victim ('Poor old Les'). How galling, how modern, that a very public cuckolding, and a brave attempt to repair a marriage, has had such an effect. Thirty years in light entertainment never brought him public recognition quite like this. </p> <p>We meet at the Oldham Coliseum, where Les, a slight, pale man with none of the overweening presence associated with seaside specials, is appearing in Misery, a stage play adapted from the Stephen King novel. He's shortly to appear in Brookside. Neither role is straightforwardly comic, which is a departure for him. Cynics and conspiracy fans might assume that the scandal actually broadened his career options, giving him access to a new range of roles, but Les, in his rather hesitant way, is very indignant about this. The Brookside bods first approached him a few years ago when he was unable to fit the soap into his schedule, and the Oldham gig is not exactly flash - he's working for the Equity minimum - and is not expected to transfer. In any case, he's always done theatre: lots of rep and musicals. Indeed, last May, he was appearing in Chicago. Cynics and conspiracy fans noted the fact that he was playing the wronged husband, but he whipped the rug out from under them when he left the show to attempt a reconciliation. </p> <p>Les hasn't done an interview since he and Amanda got back together, and to be honest I've got no idea why he wants to break the silence now. I'm expecting him to fob me off with lots of bonhomie, but it becomes apparent that he's more interested in smoke-signals, some very black and precise indeed, than smokescreens. We repair to a nearby caf\u00e9: more specifically to the grotty little dining room upstairs where he always has lunch, and which is never used by anyone else. Les, 47, does not play to the gallery. Gags are very thin on the ground, and he apologises for this at one point. There is something disconcertingly serious about him, something nervous and tired and earnest. At first he booms, rather than talks, and after a while I realise this is the sound of anxiety: bravado in the face of yet more curiosity. </p> <p>At one point, an old man comes up the stairs with a cup of tea, and sits at the next table, goggling a bit. Les says, 'Are you OK? We're doing an interview here, is that all right?' and tries to keep going, but I can see from his eyes that he's completely thrown by having an audience. 'You come into this business and you know that [tabloid interest] is part of the life,' he says, lowering his voice. 'Jonathan Ross told me that it's fame tax. I like that phrase. It's something you have to deal with, but sometimes, when there are five cars outside your house at six o'clock in the morning, that's hard. It would be so easy to become angry.' When some more footsteps are heard on the stairs, he loses the thread. 'It's kind of difficult, maybe, to talk in front of someone else...' he whispers. </p> <p>'Shall we go somewhere else?' </p> <p>'Shall we? Yeah,' says Les with obvious relief, pushing aside his tuna sandwich. On the way back to the theatre, he says he had told his press agent earlier that he wasn't going to talk about his marriage, but 'I feel I've got to, to some extent. I have chosen to talk to you because I feel like I've got to say something. The thing that has really got to me is the fact that I've been portrayed as the good guy, for one thing. Or \"the devastated guy\". It's not as simple as that. I'm old enough to know what I want. Certain people have said in the press, \"Oh Les, you know it's time to leave,\" but I want to say that A, the story that's out there isn't necessarily accurate; and B, it's nobody's position to tell me what to do.' There follows a rather surreal moment as Les Dennis awkwardly drops 'that which does not kill you makes you stronger' into the conversation. I don't know what I was expecting today, but it wasn't Nietzsche. </p> <p> Les was born in Liverpool, one of four children. His dad managed a betting shop; his mother was a factory worker at Lucas Aerospace. At school, he joined the drama group - along with Clive Barker, who would become a successful horror writer, and Jude Kelly, who now runs the West Yorkshire Playhouse - but the comedy route seemed to offer a quicker hit, a better return. When he was 11, he stepped in front of his first real audience, at the Butlins in Pwllheli, and ran through his impressions. 'If you don't have a style of your own, it's easier to nick other people's. A lot of people do impressions to begin with. Mine were something to hide behind: I didn't have to be myself. I was a different person. That was immediately obvious when I started out.' </p> <p>As a girl, his mother Winnie had her own showbiz dreams. She'd sung solo in the Liverpool Cathedral choir, and had been offered a spot in a talent show when she was 14, but her own mother had told her that she couldn't enter, that she had to go into the factories, so that was the end of that. When Les showed an interest in performing, Winnie supported him to the hilt. At weekends, she'd chauffeur him to talent contests in a Triumph 1100, bought with the two-shilling pieces she'd fed into her 'car box' over the years. 'My mum could see that I wanted to do it, but that I needed that nudge. She saw that I wanted to do it, so she encouraged me - but she wasn't a showbusiness mum, she didn't drag me there.' Les used to get terrible stage fright (still does), and heightened the tension by always turning up and putting on his costume much earlier than was necessary. Once in front of the curtains, his fears dissolved. Since he was always short on confidence, this sense of being in control, of belonging, became addictive. </p> <p>The impressions gave way to a comedy 'set' and in 1974 he won New Faces . After that, he became a fixture on light-entertainment shows, and teamed up successfully with another young comic, Dustin Gee, who died of a heart attack in 1986. This pattern of professional success and personal tragedy is a recurrent theme in Les's life. In 1987, he landed Family Fortunes: a big break, but it meant he and his first wife, Lynne, who had met at school, had to leave the security of Liverpool and move to London with their son Philip. The process was difficult, and in 1990 he and Lynne divorced. </p> <p>In 1993, when he was 39, he met Amanda, pretty, outgoing and 22, in Bournemouth, where she was appearing in a touring production of The Sound of Music. Three years later, they got married - and invited Hello!, which, as we now all know, is a bit like inviting all the fairies but one to a christening. 'It was at the time when we thought, \"Maybe we need the publicity\",' says Les, on the very edge of a smile. Hello! paid them in wedding photos: no cash changed hands. But there's little doubt this particular deal, the sale of their privacy, compromised them last summer. 'Yeah, I think we're less likely to do that again. We're going to be very choosy about what we do. Maybe it's important to not be a celebrity couple from now on.' </p> <p>He wants to make it clear that he takes partial responsibility for what happened. 'I have to take account of the fact that in a seven-year marriage, I might have made mistakes as well. Not - never - infidelity,' he adds, stumbling over his words in his anxiety to make that plain. 'Nothing to do with other people. But maybe I was caught up in my work, which is what I've done before. I just mean that I'm not a picnic. That's what you see on television, this nice guy, but nobody's like that, it's not human. It's hard on your partner if that's how you're seen. </p> <p>'Who knows what will happen in the future? Who knows - 10 years down the line, five years, 10 days? But I know Amanda and I will be in each other's life, in some capacity, always.' Look, he says, there are no kids involved, they could walk away tomorrow if they wanted to, but it comes down to this: he loves her, she loves him. 'And we're doing OK, thanks, despite what has been written. We're not prepared to give up.' At the moment, they're both staying in a flat in Manchester, where Amanda is filming a new drama, but in a few weeks she'll go back to their home in north London, and he'll be left on his own. When the subject of trust comes up, he lets me know that this is none of my business. </p> <p>He knows how the situation looks: he's walked around it enough times. 'You see the thing is, if I sit here and defend Amanda, I sound like the saint again. I'm not the saint. But if I say I'm not the saint, it's a Catch 22: people will say, \"Oh my God, isn't he coming across as just like this caring bloke.\" It's not as cut and dried as that.' </p> <p>Les talks about his wife constantly with almost defiant pride, often referring to her when the conversation has moved into quite different territory. When I ask if the light-entertainment tag has hindered his attempts to be taken more seriously, he says: 'I'm always aware of that. But maybe that's my chip, my problem. My wife might say that. She'd say, \"Come on, people are aware that you're better than that, don't be silly\".' He believes that he has relied too much on Amanda's support: she was always there to prop him up, and that must have taken its toll on her. Success didn't sweep away his lack of confidence; if anything, it made the problem worse. 'I didn't believe in myself enough. And that can become difficult to cope with. I think I was always doubting myself, saying I wasn't very good, and maybe that was frustrating for her.' </p> <p>Les has a theory about his lack of self-belief, and articulates it like someone who has done time on the couch. He thinks it was inherited from his dad, who 'couldn't believe that anyone from a working-class background could be an actor or an entertainer. \"We can't do that. Get a bloody proper job!\" ' As a boy, he was aware that his father was always terribly self-conscious. When they went out, he was always being told to pipe down, not to make a fuss, that people were looking. They weren't, of course. 'And that's the irony, because I've inherited what my dad had, and this time they are looking.' </p> <p>I think back to his discomfort in the caf\u00e9. The shy funnyman - the sad clown! - trapped in a circus of his own devising: it's all too predictable, really. But somehow, being in the audience today isn't such a laugh.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Before last summer, you may not have thought about Les Dennis that much. He was always there on the third channel, the chipper host of Family Fortunes, an old-fashioned game show that was beginning to look a little bedraggled next to its newer, flashier rivals. As cheesy and unreal as a Kraft processed slice, Les wasn't simply being eclipsed by the competition; he was also being gently shunted out of the limelight by his wife of six years, the actress Amanda Holden, as she made a name for herself in TV drama. Then in May, something awful happened. Amanda and Les split up, after her on-set affair with Neil 'Men Behaving Badly' Morrissey came to light in the tabloids. I say 'awful' advisedly. It can't have been nice for any of those involved, and the redtops' coverage of events - the spurned embrace, the trial separation, the pale bands on the ring fingers - certainly brought out the prurient worst in me. Messy and humiliating, this was a Charles and Di for Heat readers. And oh dear, how we gorged on it. If the summer had drawn to a close with a visit to the lawyers' office, Les Dennis might just have fallen off the radar altogether: after all, showbiz is littered with the corpses of failed relationships. But he didn't, because it became apparent that he and the missus were going to do the unexpected thing, the difficult thing, and give it another go. The peculiar consequence of this is that Les's profile is now at a career high, thanks to the dubious attentions of the tabloid press, which has always been fascinated by the 17-year age gap between the pair, and is currently daring the relationship not to go wrong again. Holden continues to take a kicking, whereas her husband, once considered irredeemably naff, is cast with patronising affection as the besotted victim ('Poor old Les'). How galling, how modern, that a very public cuckolding, and a brave attempt to repair a marriage, has had such an effect. Thirty years in light entertainment never brought him public recognition quite like this. We meet at the Oldham Coliseum, where Les, a slight, pale man with none of the overweening presence associated with seaside specials, is appearing in Misery, a stage play adapted from the Stephen King novel. He's shortly to appear in Brookside. Neither role is straightforwardly comic, which is a departure for him. Cynics and conspiracy fans might assume that the scandal actually broadened his career options, giving him access to a new range of roles, but Les, in his rather hesitant way, is very indignant about this. The Brookside bods first approached him a few years ago when he was unable to fit the soap into his schedule, and the Oldham gig is not exactly flash - he's working for the Equity minimum - and is not expected to transfer. In any case, he's always done theatre: lots of rep and musicals. Indeed, last May, he was appearing in Chicago. Cynics and conspiracy fans noted the fact that he was playing the wronged husband, but he whipped the rug out from under them when he left the show to attempt a reconciliation. Les hasn't done an interview since he and Amanda got back together, and to be honest I've got no idea why he wants to break the silence now. I'm expecting him to fob me off with lots of bonhomie, but it becomes apparent that he's more interested in smoke-signals, some very black and precise indeed, than smokescreens. We repair to a nearby caf\u00e9: more specifically to the grotty little dining room upstairs where he always has lunch, and which is never used by anyone else. Les, 47, does not play to the gallery. Gags are very thin on the ground, and he apologises for this at one point. There is something disconcertingly serious about him, something nervous and tired and earnest. At first he booms, rather than talks, and after a while I realise this is the sound of anxiety: bravado in the face of yet more curiosity. At one point, an old man comes up the stairs with a cup of tea, and sits at the next table, goggling a bit. Les says, 'Are you OK? We're doing an interview here, is that all right?' and tries to keep going, but I can see from his eyes that he's completely thrown by having an audience. 'You come into this business and you know that [tabloid interest] is part of the life,' he says, lowering his voice. 'Jonathan Ross told me that it's fame tax. I like that phrase. It's something you have to deal with, but sometimes, when there are five cars outside your house at six o'clock in the morning, that's hard. It would be so easy to become angry.' When some more footsteps are heard on the stairs, he loses the thread. 'It's kind of difficult, maybe, to talk in front of someone else...' he whispers. 'Shall we go somewhere else?' 'Shall we? Yeah,' says Les with obvious relief, pushing aside his tuna sandwich.

      "body": "<p><strong> Joaqu\u00edn Cortes, 32</strong> My first memory of Crist\u00f3bal is from when I was very young. I was living in Madrid at my grandparents' house. I think I first saw him dance when I was quite a lot older, but I wanted to start dancing because when I was little, Crist\u00f3bal was thought of as a hero in our family, you know? He got to travel all over the world and everyone would wait for him to come home with stories and presents, and I'd listen to his stories as if he were Marco Polo, so from a very young age I wanted to be like him. I just thought it would be great to travel around the world. </p> <p>So I set up my own company, started to travel, and when I came to do the show Pasi\u00f3n Gitana we ended up working together. I didn't find working with him difficult. It was a very good show and a very special collaboration. I believe that every person is their own world, and my uncle is a very dedicated person, very much in love with his profession. Well, you can't really describe it as a profession - it's a whole way of life. And his life and his passion is dance. He's unusual, though, because although he's deeply immersed in the gypsy culture, he's still very disciplined, and the gypsy culture is usually much more about living in the moment, about feeling: there are no timetables. Yet within that culture, he is someone who has so much respect for his work. I think that was one of the things that made the biggest impressions on me when I was young. </p> <p>Rather than being an inspiration to me, he was more a point of reference, a way of looking at how to succeed in my art. I wouldn't say he has faults, but he does have a very strong character, and people like us who are passionate about what we do - well, we have a strong temperament, and sometimes that has to come out. Crist\u00f3bal has a very strong temperament and so do I, and there have been times we've confronted each other on stage and it's got very 'heavy', there's been a lot of tension. But it's of the moment and it's always resolved. I have great respect for his work. I've been dancing now for nearly 20 years and I have great respect for both our careers. </p> <p><strong> Crist\u00f3bal Reyes, 54</strong> Joaqu\u00edn is my sister's son, so my first memory of him is of course the day he was born. But in a professional capacity, it was when I took him to audition for a children's television programme. They had to imitate Hollywood stars and dance all kinds of styles - classical, flamenco - and sing. Joaqu\u00edn was chosen. He ended up being quite famous in children's television.</p> <p> I realised when he was very young that he had great potential. I was his personal teacher in flamenco, but all his other dance teachers were amazed and excited about him. When I went to see him at a dance class - well, you could see straightaway he was a child prodigy. </p> <p>I've been a professional dancer for 40 years now, and I worked with Joaqu\u00edn for the first time for four years on Pasi\u00f3n Gitana. Working together has been a great experience, on a professional and a family level. At the moment, I'm directing, choreographing and dancing with this company that's called Pura Pasi\u00f3n, and he's co-produced the show with Se\u00f1or Pino Sagliocco, so Joaqu\u00edn's only involved on the production side. We haven't danced together since Pasi\u00f3n Gitana and we don't have any plans to, but you never know. </p> <p>But when I work with him - well, I'm his uncle and I've raised him and watched him grow up, but I've also been his teacher, so 70 per cent of what you see in Joaqu\u00edn is what I've given him, it's mine. </p> <p>Joaqu\u00edn is very disciplined, but he's a perfectionist, which is a big problem of his that at times gets too much. He likes to be a perfectionist in everything - at home, on the stage, in every part of his life. He was a typically mischievous, playful child, but from a very young age, he was dancing, training and studying. Inside he's still like a child, because he missed out on his childhood. That's why I think he's still very young in some ways - he gets excited about things, he doesn't go out drinking or smoking, he's got a football team and plays a lot. He gets enthusiastic like a child.</p>",

      "body": "<p>At Cannes last May the Palme d'Or and the best actress award should have gone to an outstanding Swedish movie, Liv Ullmann's Faithless and its leading actress Lena Endre. Instead they went to another Scandinavian film, Lars von Trier's terrible Danish musical Dancer in the Dark and its dim star, Bj\u00f6rk. Trier's film, an aberration in an interesting career, is almost forgotten, while Faithless has taken its place in one of the great oeuvres in movie history, that of Ingmar Bergman. </p> <p>Now in his eighty-third year, Bergman has only directed one film since the early 1980s, the television movie In the Presence of a Clown, a magisterial meditation on the function of theatre and cinema, shown at Cannes in 1998. It would have surely reached our small screens had British TV's film-buying officers not been such a league of frightened philistines.</p> <p>He has, however, kept busy directing other people's plays for the Dramaten, Sweden's national theatre, and writing screenplays for other people to direct. Until now these screenplays have been for costume pictures, based on autobiographical fictions about the lives of his parents and his own early days. With Faithless he confronts his elderly self head-on through a writer called Bergman (played with characteristic melancholy dignity by his lifelong friend Erland Josephson) in a film stylistically indebted to the late Bergman manner that began with Persona, his first collaboration with Ullmann. </p> <p>Solitary, white-bearded, stooping, this ageing hero is a Prospero figure, contemplating his life from the small, flat, rocky windswept island of Faro in the Baltic, where Bergman has regularly retreated from the world to write and think since the late 1950s, and which has provided the setting for several notable films, Through a Glass Darkly and The Passion of Anna among them. This Prospero's cell is a warm, uncluttered study, with shelves of LPs and CDs, a couple of leather chairs, a plain writing desk with notebooks and pencils. The stripped pine walls are bare but for a small photograph of August Strindberg, whose spirit hovers over the film, and through an internal window we can see a 16mm projector and some cans of film. </p> <p>One of the first things we hear on the soundtrack are the tinkling, endlessly repeated opening bars of Papageno's aria in The Magic Flute, 'Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen w\u00fcnscht Papageno sich', about the love and companionship that's missing from his life. In the opera, the aria conjures up Papageno's perfect soulmate, Papagena, and he is warned of the dire consequences that will befall him should he be unfaithful to her, a theme that echoes through Faithless. </p> <p>In the film this yearning tune from Mozart is revealed as coming from a tiny music box, now in Bergman's possession, which passes from hand to hand among the film's characters. The Magic Flute we know to be Bergman's favourite opera, and in the 1974 film he made of it at the Drottningholm Theatre the entranced little girl in the audience is Linn, Ullmann's daughter by Bergman. </p> <p>As Papagena appears as if by magic, so the beautiful young actress Marianne (Lena Endre) suddenly appears to Bergman in his study - at once his muse, an embodiment of a former lover and the protagonist of an expiatory drama he's writing. Bergman and Marianne act as if they're in a confessional, unable to decide who is the priest and who is the penitent.</p> <p>It turns out that Marianne is the leading lady of the Swedish theatre, happily married to an internationally acclaimed conductor, composer and musician, Markus (Thomas Hanzon), by whom she has a gifted nine-year-old daughter Isabella. The well-ordered Markus, who pretentiously compares his love-making with Marianne to conducting The Rites of Spring, is contrasted with David (Krister Henriksson), a brilliant, wayward stage and film director, up to his neck in debts, and neglecting the two children of his broken marriage. </p> <p>Marianne drifts into an affair with David that's consummated in a Paris hotel bedroom that, like the stylised d\u00e9cor of Cries and Whispers, is all red, as if we're within a pulsing human heart. They think they can control their affair without disturbing Markus, and when Markus does find out in a confrontation of farcical embarrassment, they believe they can start a new life together. In both they're mistaken. Markus is not the simple soul he appears to be; in fact in a coda he's revealed as monstrous. </p> <p>But the worm in the apple of Marianne's Eden is apparent at the beginning. During their Paris assignation David is consumed by retrospective jealousy and its compulsion to seeking shameful, detailed revelations. This sado-masochistic confrontation, which forces a lover to make confessions that bring extreme pain to the interrogator, is seen by Bergman as central to the roles of the director and actor, and is what ultimately destroys the love between Marianne and David. As the sensitive child Isabella observes the painful proceedings and becomes a pawn in the emotional and legal battles, tragedy ensues. The tone and consequences are far worse than in Bergman's cool, analytical Scenes From a Marriage, where the husband and wife were played by Josephson and Ullmann and there were no children. </p> <p>'Must it be this painful, must we always pay?' Marianne asks; the answer is a resounding yes. But in what the Bergman character calls this 'diversion before death', there is maturity in the understanding and magnanimity in the forgiveness. </p> <p>Apart from Marianne, David is the only other character Bergman directly confronts, towards the end and quite briefly. We realise that he's an earlier version of the director himself when Bergman reaches out to his tormented doppelg\u00e4nger and, in a deeply affecting moment, gives his cheek a comforting stroke. Perhaps we never get over the accumulated guilt and transgressions of a lifetime, but, so Bergman seems to be suggesting, at some stage we may earn the right to forgive our younger, less experienced selves. </p> <p> Faithless is a serious, adult film of the highest quality. It is art house cinema at its most refined, the kind of picture that many of us, at our moral best, most want to see when we go to the pictures. You'll not find a better acted movie this year, and it puts Lena Endre into the front rank of world actors.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'Sometimes it just takes a lady to smile and make your day complete.' So sang Jerry Jeff Walker, the country-singing rou\u00e9 of 'Mr Bojangles' fame. For PC purposes, obviously feel free to substitute 'gentleman' for 'lady', for it is this subject of the everyday social intercourse between us that I wish to expound upon today, or at least that aspect of it so finely developed by our cousins at the other end of the Channel Tunnel: flirting. The French have mastered this (fine) art almost to the point of it being a national cultural institution. But why, you may ask, in the context of alternative health, would I mention such a thing? Were I to be pontificating instead on the benefits of those other Gallic staples, red wine and garlic, you would hardly look askance, but if I posit the idea of flirting as invaluable for your self-esteem and hence your general wellbeing and by extension your immune system, I wonder whether your eyebrow starts spoiling for some self-raising action.</p> <p>We, the natives of these Great British Isles, are not normally comfortable with flirting. Perhaps island life breeds insularity and a fundamental unease over personal boundaries, which makes full eye contact (the basic currency of flirting) uncomfortable for us. Perhaps we are still unwittingly held hostage by Victorian prudishness or maybe it's just the weather that makes us shy and reticent to reach out from our souls to strangers in the street or in a caf\u00e9. Because, let's face it, without alcoholic support we do tend to be a socially timid bunch. Not that I'm criticising - I find our awkward ways quite fetching and indeed indulge in them all too often myself.</p> <p>Intrinsically, we all want to be acknowledged. Road, air, trolley and all the other new-fangled 'rages' we are now said to subscribe to result from feeling unacknowledged by strangers. As any driving instructor will tell you, a lot of this can be offset by initially establishing eye contact, for once eye contact is made, souls connect and you feel acknowledged. Once acknowledged, your basic sense of decency is evoked and it is hard to feel anger.</p> <p>Not wishing to stray here into negative territory, however, let me return to my theme, namely that flirting is good for your immune system. As attested to by the vast sums of money spent annually in the UK by both ladies and gentlemen on cosmetics, toiletries, clothing, grooming, and even cars and interior design and other lifestyle accoutrements, that aspect of ourselves we most wish to be acknowledged for - whether consciously or otherwise - is our essential desirability, and yes, of course, status... which again leads back to desirability.</p> <p>And what better way, other than becoming a celebrity or media star, which uses up inordinate amounts of valuable energy, to get your daily acknowledgment dose than from a bit of harmless flirting. I'm not in any way suggesting promiscuity or a new sexual revolution, simply the willingness to indulge in eye-to-eye contact and the occasional smile to make your day and theirs complete.</p> <p>Flirting is the expression of the sexy part of your character. It doesn't make you a slut or libertine. There is a clear distinction between a brief soul-to-soul connection through the eyes, facial expression and general body language, and giving someone the come-on. Obviously the extent to which you take things is your business, but that is not the point. I'm well aware of the possible dangers of 'flirt signals' being misinterpreted and resulting in trouble, for which I deeply recommend proper self-defence training, yet I'd suggest that the benefits are worth the risk.</p> <p>The beauty of a good flirt is that it need lead nowhere. You are neither being unfaithful to your partner nor to your better instincts when you smile and let flutter those lashes. You are merely bouncing a bit of harmless sexual energy between you that will help you both feel better about yourself, as a living artform, if you like, and more able to infuse any real-time relationships with more spark. In a long- term, monogamous relationship, it is also crucial that you flirt with each other, connecting your erotic selves through a moment of (heartfelt) eye contact as often as you can.</p> <p>The French, from whom we stand to learn much in these matters, are sophisticated enough to flirt without self-consciousness, prudishness or feigned coyness, even (and often especially) when in the company of partners who never seem to display jealousy. They simply accept that, like fine wine, garlic (and possibly skin creams), it's good for your health.</p> <p>Now if you find my suggestion in any way scandalous, do not read what follows, as it describes an ancient Oriental Taoist method for moving internal energy in such a way as to render you more sexually magnetic to others, and which, if practised every day for 90 days or so, will increase your personal flirtability factor to near Parisian levels.</p> <p>Imagine being able to inhale through the soles of your feet, up the inside of your legs, into your perineum (between your legs), and up to the tip of your uterus or penis, and then being able to exhale from there, back down to your perineum, across the top of your thighs, and down the outside of your legs to the soles of your feet. Repeat this with mind and breath in unison up to nine times. Additionally, supplement it with some basic auto-suggestion along the lines of, 'I am sexy!', 'I'm so sexy!' or even, 'God, I'm so sexy!'</p> <p>And please remember that feeling sexy and desirable is for everyone, as the ongoing iconic status of such (august) folk as Sir Sean Connery and Catherine Deneuve would confirm. I would say in closing, however, that for the sake of both propriety and basic aesthetics, winking should be eschewed, if at all possible.</p> <p><b> Your letters</b></p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, I'm 32, and for 10 years have suffered from irregular heartbeats. It only seems to happen after drinking coffee or just before I get a cold. Is this anything to worry about?<br><b> James Recht, email</b></p> <p>Although it is quite likely that this is due to deficient kidney chi, not holding the 'heart fire' sufficiently in check, it would be prudent of you to arrange a check-up with a good heart specialist, as it's possible you my have a heart murmur or leaking valve. However, assuming it's more of an energy disorder, you could benefit from taking hawthorn tincture and lily of the valley, eating lots of radishes and massaging the chest region with essential oil of rose. Additionally, visit a shiatsu or acupuncture specialist to boost the kidney chi and reduce heart fire if necessary. And, of course, reduce caffeine intake and perhaps indulge in a bit of yogic breath-control training.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, I'm in my early 40s and am concerned that my throat is starting to sag and wrinkle. Is there any natural alternative to cosmetic surgery that you can suggest?<br><b> Andrea Newton, Maidenhead, Berks</b></p> <p>In addition to massaging your throat on a daily basis using good-quality neck-firming cream as lubricant, with one hand on either side of your throat, with alternating movements in the manner of starting a fire by twirling a stick between your hands and using a good exfoliant to promote cell renewal, try, while sitting comfortably with spine straight, hanging your head back an inch or two with jaw open. Close your jaw slowly and feel the stretch through your throat. Hold like this for 30 seconds or so and return the head to upright slowly. As well as firming your throat, this treatment has the added benefits of stimulating your thyroid and clearing up sore throats.</p> <p>\u0095 If you have any problems you would like answered, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email him at <a href=\"mailto:barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk</a>.

      "bodyText": "'Sometimes it just takes a lady to smile and make your day complete.' So sang Jerry Jeff Walker, the country-singing rou\u00e9 of 'Mr Bojangles' fame. For PC purposes, obviously feel free to substitute 'gentleman' for 'lady', for it is this subject of the everyday social intercourse between us that I wish to expound upon today, or at least that aspect of it so finely developed by our cousins at the other end of the Channel Tunnel: flirting. The French have mastered this (fine) art almost to the point of it being a national cultural institution. But why, you may ask, in the context of alternative health, would I mention such a thing? Were I to be pontificating instead on the benefits of those other Gallic staples, red wine and garlic, you would hardly look askance, but if I posit the idea of flirting as invaluable for your self-esteem and hence your general wellbeing and by extension your immune system, I wonder whether your eyebrow starts spoiling for some self-raising action. We, the natives of these Great British Isles, are not normally comfortable with flirting. Perhaps island life breeds insularity and a fundamental unease over personal boundaries, which makes full eye contact (the basic currency of flirting) uncomfortable for us. Perhaps we are still unwittingly held hostage by Victorian prudishness or maybe it's just the weather that makes us shy and reticent to reach out from our souls to strangers in the street or in a caf\u00e9. Because, let's face it, without alcoholic support we do tend to be a socially timid bunch. Not that I'm criticising - I find our awkward ways quite fetching and indeed indulge in them all too often myself. Intrinsically, we all want to be acknowledged. Road, air, trolley and all the other new-fangled 'rages' we are now said to subscribe to result from feeling unacknowledged by strangers. As any driving instructor will tell you, a lot of this can be offset by initially establishing eye contact, for once eye contact is made, souls connect and you feel acknowledged. Once acknowledged, your basic sense of decency is evoked and it is hard to feel anger. Not wishing to stray here into negative territory, however, let me return to my theme, namely that flirting is good for your immune system. As attested to by the vast sums of money spent annually in the UK by both ladies and gentlemen on cosmetics, toiletries, clothing, grooming, and even cars and interior design and other lifestyle accoutrements, that aspect of ourselves we most wish to be acknowledged for - whether consciously or otherwise - is our essential desirability, and yes, of course, status... which again leads back to desirability. And what better way, other than becoming a celebrity or media star, which uses up inordinate amounts of valuable energy, to get your daily acknowledgment dose than from a bit of harmless flirting. I'm not in any way suggesting promiscuity or a new sexual revolution, simply the willingness to indulge in eye-to-eye contact and the occasional smile to make your day and theirs complete. Flirting is the expression of the sexy part of your character. It doesn't make you a slut or libertine. There is a clear distinction between a brief soul-to-soul connection through the eyes, facial expression and general body language, and giving someone the come-on. Obviously the extent to which you take things is your business, but that is not the point. I'm well aware of the possible dangers of 'flirt signals' being misinterpreted and resulting in trouble, for which I deeply recommend proper self-defence training, yet I'd suggest that the benefits are worth the risk. The beauty of a good flirt is that it need lead nowhere. You are neither being unfaithful to your partner nor to your better instincts when you smile and let flutter those lashes. You are merely bouncing a bit of harmless sexual energy between you that will help you both feel better about yourself, as a living artform, if you like, and more able to infuse any real-time relationships with more spark. In a long- term, monogamous relationship, it is also crucial that you flirt with each other, connecting your erotic selves through a moment of (heartfelt) eye contact as often as you can. The French, from whom we stand to learn much in these matters, are sophisticated enough to flirt without self-consciousness, prudishness or feigned coyness, even (and often especially) when in the company of partners who never seem to display jealousy. They simply accept that, like fine wine, garlic (and possibly skin creams), it's good for your health. Now if you find my suggestion in any way scandalous, do not read what follows, as it describes an ancient Oriental Taoist method for moving internal energy in such a way as to render you more sexually magnetic to others, and which, if practised every day for 90 days or so, will increase your personal flirtability factor to near Parisian levels. Imagine being able to inhale through the soles of your feet, up the inside of your legs, into your perineum (between your legs), and up to the tip of your uterus or penis, and then being able to exhale from there, back down to your perineum, across the top of your thighs, and down the outside of your legs to the soles of your feet. Repeat this with mind and breath in unison up to nine times. Additionally, supplement it with some basic auto-suggestion along the lines of, 'I am sexy!', 'I'm so sexy!' or even, 'God, I'm so sexy!' And please remember that feeling sexy and desirable is for everyone, as the ongoing iconic status of such (august) folk as Sir Sean Connery and Catherine Deneuve would confirm. I would say in closing, however, that for the sake of both propriety and basic aesthetics, winking should be eschewed, if at all possible. Your letters Dear Barefoot Doctor, I'm 32, and for 10 years have suffered from irregular heartbeats. It only seems to happen after drinking coffee or just before I get a cold. Is this anything to worry about? James Recht, email Although it is quite likely that this is due to deficient kidney chi, not holding the 'heart fire' sufficiently in check, it would be prudent of you to arrange a check-up with a good heart specialist, as it's possible you my have a heart murmur or leaking valve. However, assuming it's more of an energy disorder, you could benefit from taking hawthorn tincture and lily of the valley, eating lots of radishes and massaging the chest region with essential oil of rose. Additionally, visit a shiatsu or acupuncture specialist to boost the kidney chi and reduce heart fire if necessary. And, of course, reduce caffeine intake and perhaps indulge in a bit of yogic breath-control training. Dear Barefoot Doctor, I'm in my early 40s and am concerned that my throat is starting to sag and wrinkle. Is there any natural alternative to cosmetic surgery that you can suggest? Andrea Newton, Maidenhead, Berks In addition to massaging your throat on a daily basis using good-quality neck-firming cream as lubricant, with one hand on either side of your throat, with alternating movements in the manner of starting a fire by twirling a stick between your hands and using a good exfoliant to promote cell renewal, try, while sitting comfortably with spine straight, hanging your head back an inch or two with jaw open. Close your jaw slowly and feel the stretch through your throat. Hold like this for 30 seconds or so and return the head to upright slowly. As well as firming your throat, this treatment has the added benefits of stimulating your thyroid and clearing up sore throats. \u0095 If you have any problems you would like answered, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email him at barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk.

      "body": "<p>Dame Judi Dench, in the garb of an elderly French matron, shifted her weight in her canvas chair, wrapped her shawl round her shoulders and looked up from her tapestry work to peer balefully at a muddy English field. 'So here we are in Wiltshire,' she told me, a distinct edge in her voice. 'Or possibly Somerset.' Dramatic pause for effect. 'Do you know, it might even be Dorset.' </p> <p>They have killer timing, these theatrical dames, especially when they strive for dry humour. I informed her that here, near the village of Bruton, we're in Somerset by a matter of a few miles. But one saw her point: this sodden, windswept part of the West Country seemed an odd location for a film set entirely in France. </p> <p>It's also a prosaic place to shoot a movie whose star actress trades on a 'comment dit-on?' enigmatic quality. One can think of several kind things to say about Somerset, or possibly Wiltshire; but 'enigmatic' is not a word that swiftly comes to mind. </p> <p>Yet there she was, Juliette Binoche, tramping across a field, her beautiful dark eyes darting shyly about her, her trademark vestigial smile dancing on her lips in perpetual celebration of some private joke. If she seemed vaguely out of place, it clearly suited her. 'I'm in a good mood,' she announced, giving a dazzling smile. 'I feel we're lucky as actors to be able to go to different countries and meet different people.' </p> <p>This is a turn-up for the books. Journalists approach Binoche on film sets with trepidation; she is not known for being upbeat. I have observed her tense and moody on two previous films, though on seeing them one understood why. Damage (1992), counts as a rare lapse by its director, the late Louis Malle. That same year, in the abject disaster Wuthering Heights, she was miscast hopelessly as Emily Bronte's heroine Cathy opposite an uncomfortable Ralph Fiennes as Heathcliff. </p> <p>This current film, an adaptation of Chocolat, based on the bestseller by Anglo-French author Joanne Harris, looks altogether more promising. Financed by Miramax, headed by that incorrigible Europhile Harvey Weinstein, it has been well received in America, and will have a glitzy premi\u00e8re in London tomorrow. On Tuesday, it should receive several Oscar nominations; this year, Chocolat is the Miramax film to benefit from Weinstein's legendary, aggressive Oscar campaigning, which in previous years helped Shakespeare in Love, The English Patient, Il Postino and The Cider House Rules . </p> <p> Chocolat is set in 1959 in a small, quiet, uptight French town, and is being shot partly in the West Country rather than France to qualify it as a British film, and thus save considerably - because of tax breaks - on its budget. Binoche plays Vianne Rocher, a striking looking Frenchwoman who settles there with her young daughter, and opens up a chocolate shop across the square from the church. She sells mouth-watering candies and has an uncanny knack of anticipating each customer's precise desires, which she satisfies with exactly the right confection. </p> <p>Her talent for temptation brings her in conflict with the community's more self-righteous citizens, and the mayor (Alfred Molina) tries to run her out of town. Meanwhile Vianne allies herself with a band of travellers who live at the edge of town in poverty; one, a handsome wanderer named Roux, is played by Johnny Depp. 'This is a light piece, a happy piece,' Binoche said gaily in the warmth of her trailer. 'It's about chocolate, you know, how bad can that be?' </p> <p>Clearly, then, Binoche likes this film, and with good reason; it puts her in distinguished company. There's Depp, Molina and Dame Judi, who plays Armande, a witch-like older woman in the town, and one of Vianne's early allies. The formidable Swedish actress Lena Olin is Josephine, a townswoman whose unhappy life is transformed by chocolate's healing powers. The great classical actor John Wood is Guillaume, an elderly citizen who finds rejuvenation in Vianne's candies. And legendary veteran French screen star Leslie Caron ( Gigi, An American In Paris) portrays a disapproving widow, Madame Audel. </p> <p>Swedish director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, still basking in the success of last year's The Cider House Rules, is corralling the whole troupe. Famously one of the world's most patient, affable directors, he is working for the first time with his wife Olin; his bonhomie makes the company cheerful enough to ignore the English weather. </p> <p> Chocolat will count as a significant entry on Binoche's CV. Four years have now elapsed since she made the transition from European art-house icon to internationally recognised film actress. In The English Patient, she was a French-Canadian nurse in World War II traumatised by grief when her lover is killed in action. The film cleaned up at the 1997 Oscars, and Binoche became the first French actress in 37 years to win an Oscar, since Simone Signoret in Room at the Top. Hollywood was at her feet; a fortune was hers for the making. So what did she do? She returned home, and in what looked like bloody-mindedness made five French-language films in a row. Oh, and she took a role at Islington's Almeida theatre, in a production of Pirandello's play Naked. It paid \u00a3250 a week. </p> <p>It has taken her this long to return to English-language filmmaking. Why did Binoche wait, rather than capitalise on her success in The English Patient ? She sighed impatiently. 'My aim is not to be an American star. Otherwise I would have moved there.' </p> <p>She had long been declining Hollywood's entreaties. She turned down Steven Spielberg's offer to play the female lead in Jurassic Park, which went to Laura Dern; and she could have had Emmanuelle Beart's part in Mission: Impossible. In retrospect, then, her judgment seems admirable. </p> <p>Rays of sunlight darted through the clouds, and Bruton became temporarily transformed into a sunlit day in the garden of a French cottage. Dench, Wood and Caron were among eight characters seated at a banqueting table, and Olin scurried around pouring wine. Then Binoche emerged, carrying a huge platter of seafood, and followed by French child actress Victoire Thivisol, who plays her daughter. Binoche smiled broadly: 'Bon appetit, everyone!' The assembled company went 'aaaah!' at the sight of the food. And Hallstr\u00f6m murmured: 'Cut!' After four takes, he had his scene, and the cast dispersed. The mood seemed relaxed. In part, Binoche deserves the credit; lead actors as much as directors can dictate the mood of a set. Caron, who played her mother in Damage, observed that she has matured. 'Her personality has opened up so much,' she said. 'And I think it's because she has children now. I admire her level-headedness. Her attitude is very good-natured. Very few young women have that attitude of always being game.' Dench was equally complimentary: 'Juliette is so easy to work with. On our very first day, we had a big scene to do. There was no awkwardness, we just got on with it and did it, and it was lovely. She has a divine sense of humour, which I like.' </p> <p>And Hallstr\u00f6m noted: 'She's a great actress, Juliette. She's got taste. But this is a different venue for her too, I think. For once she's playing a character that's warm and outgoing and generous. It's different for her.' </p> <p>Nothing, it seemed, could ruin Binoche's mood on this day. She is even relaxed about fame's attendant irritations: 'It's a question of choices. We were shooting recently in a French village, and people came along to see me. So I had lots of autographs to sign. You can decide: \"I won' t do that, it's stupid.\" But it's like offering chocolate - it's about the gesture of doing it. You have to be open to other people, because your work makes some connection with them. Sometimes I wasn't in a mood for it, but you have to deal with your emotions, admit you don't feel like doing it and say to the person, \"I'm sorry, this isn't the right time\".' Usually, then, her celebrity doesn't become intrusive? 'Oh no. I mean, it's not as bad for me as it is for American stars. That's a completely different world. You become a prisoner.' And even when she's in a good mood, the feisty Mme Binoche is no one's idea of a prisoner. </p> <p> <strong> Chocolat opens on 2 March.

      "body": "<p>The first day of a big trial at the Old Bailey is always a bit of an event. Barristers standing around the doors of the court, witnesses smoking on the benches outside, the jury waiting to be sworn in and the police team carrying boxes of documents into the exhibits room. It was 30 October last year when I first met Detective Chief Inspector Peter Ship, who was waiting for the judge to get some preliminary business in Court 15 out of the way. Ship looks like my kind of copper. Short back and sides, dodgy suit, not someone to mess with. He's been a detective in the Met for 24 years and now he runs a murder squad at Edmonton Green. A squad is a team of 20 and Ship has 18 murders on his books. This one was complicated. Five defendants, three of them juveniles, racial overtones. It has been a year coming to court and the police investigation has generated 3,000 pages of statements and transcripts.</p> <p>11.30am and Judge Giles Forrester is ready to begin. Senior Treasury Counsel William Boyce, of silken voice and imposing presence, rises to his feet to open the case for the prosecution. The story he tells over the following month and a half could be refined down to no more than five minutes of irrational violence which was to shock and traumatise a community and blight the lives of at least two families.</p> <p>On the morning in question, 13 September 1999, Southgate College in north London is busy with the registration of 1,200 new students. The town centre is full of 16- and 17-year-olds who have already signed on, been given a tour, and told to go away until the next day - the first day of term. College security guards are keeping an eye on newly arrived, heavily testosteroned 16-year-olds eager to mark out their territory, and the shops and restaurants in the town are perking up with the sudden increase in business after spare summer months.</p> <p>Southgate is a racially diverse college. In spite of the variety of nationalities and the consequential cultural cocktail, there is no history of racial problems in the student community. Heather Barret-Mold, the vice- principal, says that on the rare occasions when there is a dispute, it is due to the implacable question of teenage hormones which, in her experience, cause trouble wherever adolescent children gather. 'We have 2,500 full-time students here and we do all we can to make sure the atmosphere is calm and welcoming,' she says.</p> <p>At around 12.30pm, five young Somalis, having finished their business in the college, turn left out of the front gates and start walking along the road. They are on their way to Chase Side, the high street which runs through the centre of the town and carries on to Hadley Wood and the wastelands of the northern M25. A second group, made up of Afro-Caribbean and Asian boys, is lounging around on the pavement by a car parked on Ashfield Parade by the Southgate sorting office, just outside the college grounds. Both groups are dressed in trainers, coloured tops and chinos. One of the Asians, a short chubby youth, is noticeable for his spiky, greasy hair and a thin beard. His name is Bodrul Miah.</p> <p>As the groups draw level, there is a brief verbal confrontation - no more than a minor exchange of discourtesies - which is over in a couple of minutes. It is the fag end of an altercation which took place on a college induction day the previous Thursday, between Mohammed Abdullahi, one of the Somalis, and an Asian called Avinash Aubeelack, who is not present on this second occasion. The origin of the dispute is unknown but, in the opinion of the police and the college authorities, was likely to be of the 'Who you looking at?' variety and nothing more. However, it is serious enough for the security staff to be called to calm everyone down.</p> <p>Mustafa Osman walks over, talks to the group on the pavement and, believing that whatever dispute there was has now been amicably settled, offers his hand to Ryan Reid, one of the West Indians. When the gesture is rejected, Mustafa shrugs and, together with his four companions, carries on down the road towards the high street with the idea of visiting an arcade near the bus terminal for a game of pool before lunch at McDonald's. It is the Somalis' first excursion in the area and the five young men appear at this stage to have gone the wrong way, turning left before the bus station and walking down a curved road called Crown Lane which runs parallel to the high street.</p> <p>When they reach the back entrance of Southgate police station, they decide to retrace their steps towards the college. As they walk back on the right-hand side of the street, they see the other group jogging down Crown Lane towards them. Anthony Alexander, one of the boys who was with them earlier, has now been replaced by Aubeelack. He is accompanied by Ryan Reid, Mohammed Basil Mollany, Marcus Oranu and Bodrul Miah, all students from Southgate.</p> <p>The two groups come face to face outside Rodwin's toy shop, opposite an alleyway which runs down the side of the Rising Sun pub. It is unclear precisely what words are said at this stage. What is certain is that the verbal aggression degenerates into a fist fight started by Reid and Miah. As the first blows are struck, Reid passes a black-handled clasp knife to the spiky-haired Miah, who opens it up and conceals it behind his back before producing it seconds later, tossing it from hand to hand and lunging forward in an attack on Mustafa Osman, stabbing him first in the arm and then in the back.</p> <p>As Mustafa shouts in pain and turns to get away, his cousin, Abdul Osman, produces a canister of mace and aims it in the direction of Miah. He then pockets the canister and attacks Miah, trying to take the knife out of his hand and punching him in the face as he does so. The fighting has erupted out of nowhere and for no clear reason. It progresses without any regard to witnesses or passers-by as all 10 boys become involved.</p> <p>In the centre of the melee, Miah now turns his full attention on Abdul Osman and begins stabbing him violently. Holding the knife in his right hand, he plunges it repeatedly into the Somali's torso. Witnesses describe the stabbings as a series of fast, sweeping movements which sound like someone beating a carpet. Six cuts are later found in Osman's jacket. Osman, unable to defend himself, suffers wounds to his stomach before a final, dreadful blow as Miah plunges the knife into his neck, slicing through the carotid artery. The blow is sufficiently violent to cut through two thick layers of leather in Osman's jacket collar and penetrate four inches into his flesh.</p> <p>The assault against the Somalis continues across the road. There is no dialogue between the groups, just the desperate expletives and shouts of hand-to-hand fighting. A second knife is produced by Aubeelack, who is unable to use it before it is taken from him by Abdullahi. Now the groups begin to separate as Reid and his associates start to appreciate the enormity of what they have done.</p> <p>Abdul Osman knows that he has been badly hurt. The blood is pumping from his neck and out of his nose and mouth. He spins round, runs across the road and down the alleyway beside the Rising Sun. By the time he reaches Chase Side, about 100 yards away, he has lost a lot of blood. He turns left and begins to limp along the pavement towards the police station, haemorrhaging as he goes. His route is marked with pools of blood; the road, the pathways and the brick walls of the alleyway are sprayed with dark arterial blood. He is dying as he runs.</p> <p>Mustafa Osman, unarmed and badly injured, also decides to get away and runs down Crown Lane away from the skirmish. After a while, Miah, who has set off in pursuit, calls it a day and returns to his associates, saying, 'Let's go after the other one.' Mustafa, however, has collapsed on the pavement and is given first aid by a female passer-by. Miah, coming down from his blood lust, leaves the scene and makes his way home by bus to Tottenham to clean himself up.</p> <p>Miah is covered in blood, both from the wounds he has inflicted on Abdul Osman and from a cut on the top of his buttocks. There is no clear explanation for this wound, although the police believe that, while attempting to hide the blood-stained knife, he tucked it into his trousers and stabbed himself. He has the wound stitched and dressed at the North Middlesex Hospital, claiming he slipped while climbing over a fence.</p> <p>Immediately after the fight, Abdi Hassan, a Somali and a cousin of Mustafa Osman, escapes to the high street to find a phone where he can call for assistance. He runs through the bus depot to the White Hart pub, where he dials 999. Both groups are now dispersing, fast. Abdul Osman, helped by Mohammed Mohammed, the fifth member of the Somali group, has managed to reach the police station. Weak from loss of blood, he half crawls and is half carried up the steps of the building. He manages to reach the reception area, where he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.</p> <p>Back in Crown Lane, Abdullahi, Abdul Osman's cousin, starts to pursue Ryan Reid and another West Indian, Marcus Oranu. The three boys run down the alleyway and turn back to the college. As he chases them, Abdullahi, mad with rage, once again confronts Aubeelack, who has also left the fight and is now standing outside the college gates. As they struggle, Aubeelack repossesses the weapon and in the process wounds Abdullahi in the wrist. Aubeelack now runs away from the scene. The knife is never found.</p> <p>Abdullahi returns to the town centre and follows the trail of blood from Crown Lane back to the police station, where he pushes his way through the crowd gathering outside the building, runs up the steps and looks through the door into the reception. He can see Osman in a pool of blood on the floor and hears a policeman say, 'The boy's dead.'</p> <p>The sight of his dead cousin has a devastating effect on Abdullahi. He leaves the police station, dodges the police who try to stop him, and runs wildly back to the college; witnesses later describe him as 'rabid'. As he arrives at the gates, he sees Miah's younger brother, Nural, a boy he has known since secondary school. There is now uproar in the college, underlined by the sound of police sirens. As Abdullahi, bleeding heavily from his cut wrist, starts to attack Nural, shouting, 'Your brother's just stabbed Abdul,' the first police car arrives on the approach road.</p> <p>Abdullahi, pursued by a woman police constable, now runs into the college, where he sees Reid. He attacks him, shouting 'There's the man who stabbed my cousin.' Reid runs, pursued by the police, and is eventually arrested by the WPC. It is 12.50pm - 20 minutes since the five Somalis left Southgate college on their way to McDonald's.</p> <p>The police, faced with this sudden and completely unexpected eruption of violent disorder, have done what little they can to make Abdul Osman comfortable. The reception office has been converted into a casualty station, but Abdul's wounds are too serious to be dealt with by first aid and the air ambulance is called from the London Hospital at Whitechapel. Alarmed that a pitched battle has been fought in Southgate town centre, the police cordon off the town and traffic begins to crawl to a halt throughout north London. The air ambulance lands on a roundabout and paramedics are with Osman within 60 seconds. They perform open-heart surgery on the floor of the police station, but can do nothing to save him. Abdul Osman is pronounced dead on the way to hospital.</p> <p>Police response to the murder is immediate and intense. They are faced with a teenage black boy who has been stabbed to death in London just a matter of weeks after the publication of the Macpherson report. What's more, he has died in a police station. Within minutes of Osman's death, the forensic teams from Edmonton are working at the scene of the battle and a 20-strong murder squad under Peter Ship is in place.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Bodrul Miah, now back in his home, sets about altering his appearance, shaving his head and beard and disposing of the clothes he has worn during the fight. Miah's father, Basharath, arrives home at seven in the evening and between them they decide he should leave the country. Basharath arranges for an emergency passport and buys his son a one-way ticket to Bangladesh for the morning of 15 September at a cost of \u00a3251. Two days after the killing in Southgate, Bodrul Miah is on his way out of the country.</p> <p>It is a difficult investigation. There are many witnesses, but most are reluctant to come forward. Those who do are confused about what they have seen. No weapons are ever found. The murder is the result of 10 boys fighting each other in parallel streets at the same time. There is no obvious motive. It is over very quickly and finishes with the protagonists leaving the area at great speed in different directions. The scene of death is complex, with trails of blood leading in all directions. To make it worse, apart from the floor and walls in the police station, the blood is outside and rain is forecast for that night. The crime area, which includes three busy main roads, remains cordoned off by the Metropolitan Police Tactical Support Group until the following morning.</p> <p>The postmortem is carried out within hours of the crime and the police know they are dealing with a murder. Reid is under arrest and the police are certain that most, if not all, of those involved are students at Southgate. They have statements from the surviving Somalis and are beginning to piece together the complex details of the fight. The word which no one mentions is 'race'.</p> <p>I talk to a bus driver who was on duty in the Southgate depot on the day of the killing. 'We believed it was a race murder,' he says. 'The Somalis are a different culture, a race apart, and they were picked on by the Asians because they are peaceful people, but nobody will admit it. Nowadays, a white man kills a black and all hell breaks loose; black kills another black and it's an embarrassment.'</p> <p>The police, however, deny that it is a racial incident, as do the social services, local Enfield MP Steven Twigg, the college and everyone involved in the analysis of what has happened. The local population of Southgate, however, seems to be of a different opinion and the word in the Rising Sun is that it is a 'tribal' matter which got out of hand.</p> <p>The police admit to concern about local unrest in the streets and go quickly to the college authorities for help. DI David Osborne, who is given day-to-day charge of the investigation, tells me, 'Without the college, we would have struggled. Its CCTV system helped us trace the movements of both groups and meant we could dispose of problems caused by disputes over who actually took part in the fight. We were able to produce a clear picture of Bodrul Miah before he changed his appearance and prove that Aubeelack was involved in the fight. The Somalis and many of the street witnesses identified him as the short, fat Asian - the aggressor with the knife. We had to deal with the local community, set up liaison officers to help the parents and decided to create a multi-agency group which would keep the various communities in touch. The priority was the safety and peace of mind of the children in the college.'</p> <p>'We never treated it as a crime caused by racial hatred,' says DCI Peter Ship. 'There was no history of racial conflict at Southgate College. We saw it as an unjustified assault by five teenage boys during which an innocent victim was fatally stabbed.'</p> <p>The police piece together the movements of the two groups. Within a week, they know that Miah is involved but has no motive. They know he vanished on the day before he is due to start at college, but have no idea of his whereabouts. They interview his father, expecting to find him at home, but Basharath claims he has lost touch with his son and believes he is working outside London.</p> <p>The police assume Miah is still in Britain and settle down to a long period of detailed investigation. They recreate what happened during the fight and they work out from the video evidence and witness statements who was involved. Within a couple of months, they know who brought the weapons and they know where everyone was including Bodrul Miah. Basharath's detention five months after the murder is followed by Nural's visit to Bangladesh. Bodrul Miah is told that his father is under arrest and agrees to return to the UK. He gives himself up at Edmonton Green police station on 8 March 2000.</p> <p>There are five counts on the indictment. Reid and Miah are charged with murdering Abdul Osman; Miah and Aubeelack with wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Mustafa Osman. Miah, Reid, Mollany, Oranu and Aubeelack are charged with violent disorder and Basharath Miah with attempting to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>The case comes to trial at the Old Bailey on 30 October 2000. Mollany and Oranu plead guilty to violent disorder, having named Miah as the murderer in their police interviews. Their evidence could consequently not be used in court.</p> <p>Abdul Osman had been a bright 18-year-old, one of a family of 10 who had been brought up single-handedly by their mother, Hawa Farah, after their father left them and went to live in the north of England. The family had emigrated to London from the Yemen and had lived in Edmonton for 14 years. The other Somalis in the group, Mustafa Osman, Abdullahi, Hassan and Mohammed, were all close friends or relatives who had known each other for years. None of them was known to be violent.</p> <p>Throughout the trial, the police liaison officer, Bob Kendall, drives Abdul's mother and her daughter Zainab to court, where she sits only a few feet away from the boy accused of murdering her son. The two women come to the Old Bailey every day and during Ramadan they leave the court at noon to say prayers in an upstairs room. I talk to them in the Old Bailey canteen. They tell me that Abdul was no troublemaker, that he had lots of friends and that they miss him dearly because he made his mother smile and she was always happy when he was there. 'The police took us to where he was killed and it was very hard because we walked where he walked. People need to understand the effect the murder of a son has. I wouldn't wish it on anyone in the world.'</p> <p>The trial is a lengthy, solemn, occasionally bad-tempered affair. Senior Treasury Counsel William Boyce, prosecuting, is forced to translate much of the Afro-Caribbean jargon and to meticulously dissect and repeat for the jury every choreographic detail of the fight on Crown Lane and every nuance of the defendants' behaviour. Vera Baird QC defends Miah, who declines to give evidence after Reid is comprehensively filleted by prosecuting counsel. She is forced to rely on a defence of mistaken identity. There is a total of 14 wigs in court and the complexities of the proceedings in the end result in a three-month trial.</p> <p>Miah's rapid disappearance after the fight is explained away as attending a family wedding. But why he flies to Bangladesh and completely changes his appearance on the day he was due in college is impossible to explain away. Reid lies repeatedly in the witness box - to the despair of his counsel, Sally O'Neill. He also claims that he knows none of the other defendants, in spite of the fact that the police formally cautioned him with Miah and Mollany after catching them smoking pot in a car in Epping Forest in April 1999.</p> <p>There is an inevitability about the result. On Tuesday 23 January, after three days' deliberation, the jury convicts Miah of murder, convicts Miah and Aubeelack of attempted wounding, convicts Reid, Mollany, Oranu and Aubeelack of violent disorder and convicts Basharath Miah of attempting to pervert the course of justice.</p> <p>Judge Forrester delays sentencing for a month and expresses great sympathy and admiration for Abdul Osman's family for attending court every day.</p> <p>There is often a sense of anticlimax at the end of a long criminal trial. Barristers and solicitors stand around making small talk and saying goodbye. The brief camaraderie between court staff and the police fragments as the boxes of evidence are carried away to be stored in damp cellars somewhere in the capital, and hacks from the press benches loiter expectantly, trawling for indiscretions.</p> <p>The last days of the trial of Bodrul Miah and his associates are no different. After Basharath Miah and Reid briefly return to face Judge Forrester and have their bail applications rejected, half a dozen members of the police team gather outside the court doors trying to decide where to go for a pint or two. Peter Ship, now promoted to Detective Superintendent, shows no overt sign of triumph. 'It was a difficult operation for us, but our multi-agency approach worked well and we're happy with the result.'</p> <p>Late on the Tuesday afternoon, I watch Abdul Osman's mother and his sister leaving the Old Bailey for the last time and stepping out into an empty world. They talk to me of their gratitude to the police, the witnesses who came forward, the prosecuting counsel; the transient people of the law who had filled the family's lives for a year. But justice does little to heal the wounds of the bereaved and Abdul's mother has persistently refused counselling. Now they are alone with memories of a loved one violently done to death.</p> <p>The judge's comments on the women's dignity and courage and their constant presence in court almost certainly had an effect on the jury's deliberations. But their son and brother had been taken away, simply because a young man had gone to college armed with a knife. It's impossible to know how many lives will be damaged by this one act of stupidity.</p> <p>There were 131,500 serious assaults in London between April 1998 and the end of March 1999. It is not racism which has become endemic in society, it is violence.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first day of a big trial at the Old Bailey is always a bit of an event. Barristers standing around the doors of the court, witnesses smoking on the benches outside, the jury waiting to be sworn in and the police team carrying boxes of documents into the exhibits room. It was 30 October last year when I first met Detective Chief Inspector Peter Ship, who was waiting for the judge to get some preliminary business in Court 15 out of the way. Ship looks like my kind of copper. Short back and sides, dodgy suit, not someone to mess with. He's been a detective in the Met for 24 years and now he runs a murder squad at Edmonton Green. A squad is a team of 20 and Ship has 18 murders on his books. This one was complicated. Five defendants, three of them juveniles, racial overtones. It has been a year coming to court and the police investigation has generated 3,000 pages of statements and transcripts. 11.30am and Judge Giles Forrester is ready to begin. Senior Treasury Counsel William Boyce, of silken voice and imposing presence, rises to his feet to open the case for the prosecution. The story he tells over the following month and a half could be refined down to no more than five minutes of irrational violence which was to shock and traumatise a community and blight the lives of at least two families. On the morning in question, 13 September 1999, Southgate College in north London is busy with the registration of 1,200 new students. The town centre is full of 16- and 17-year-olds who have already signed on, been given a tour, and told to go away until the next day - the first day of term. College security guards are keeping an eye on newly arrived, heavily testosteroned 16-year-olds eager to mark out their territory, and the shops and restaurants in the town are perking up with the sudden increase in business after spare summer months. Southgate is a racially diverse college. In spite of the variety of nationalities and the consequential cultural cocktail, there is no history of racial problems in the student community. Heather Barret-Mold, the vice- principal, says that on the rare occasions when there is a dispute, it is due to the implacable question of teenage hormones which, in her experience, cause trouble wherever adolescent children gather. 'We have 2,500 full-time students here and we do all we can to make sure the atmosphere is calm and welcoming,' she says. At around 12.30pm, five young Somalis, having finished their business in the college, turn left out of the front gates and start walking along the road. They are on their way to Chase Side, the high street which runs through the centre of the town and carries on to Hadley Wood and the wastelands of the northern M25. A second group, made up of Afro-Caribbean and Asian boys, is lounging around on the pavement by a car parked on Ashfield Parade by the Southgate sorting office, just outside the college grounds. Both groups are dressed in trainers, coloured tops and chinos. One of the Asians, a short chubby youth, is noticeable for his spiky, greasy hair and a thin beard. His name is Bodrul Miah. As the groups draw level, there is a brief verbal confrontation - no more than a minor exchange of discourtesies - which is over in a couple of minutes. It is the fag end of an altercation which took place on a college induction day the previous Thursday, between Mohammed Abdullahi, one of the Somalis, and an Asian called Avinash Aubeelack, who is not present on this second occasion. The origin of the dispute is unknown but, in the opinion of the police and the college authorities, was likely to be of the 'Who you looking at?' variety and nothing more. However, it is serious enough for the security staff to be called to calm everyone down. Mustafa Osman walks over, talks to the group on the pavement and, believing that whatever dispute there was has now been amicably settled, offers his hand to Ryan Reid, one of the West Indians. When the gesture is rejected, Mustafa shrugs and, together with his four companions, carries on down the road towards the high street with the idea of visiting an arcade near the bus terminal for a game of pool before lunch at McDonald's. It is the Somalis' first excursion in the area and the five young men appear at this stage to have gone the wrong way, turning left before the bus station and walking down a curved road called Crown Lane which runs parallel to the high street. When they reach the back entrance of Southgate police station, they decide to retrace their steps towards the college. As they walk back on the right-hand side of the street, they see the other group jogging down Crown Lane towards them. Anthony Alexander, one of the boys who was with them earlier, has now been replaced by Aubeelack. He is accompanied by Ryan Reid, Mohammed Basil Mollany, Marcus Oranu and Bodrul Miah, all students from Southgate. The two groups come face to face outside Rodwin's toy shop, opposite an alleyway which runs down the side of the Rising Sun pub. It is unclear precisely what words are said at this stage. What is certain is that the verbal aggression degenerates into a fist fight started by Reid and Miah.

They know he vanished on the day before he is due to start at college, but have no idea of his whereabouts. They interview his father, expecting to find him at home, but Basharath claims he has lost touch with his son and believes he is working outside London. The police assume Miah is still in Britain and settle down to a long period of detailed investigation. They recreate what happened during the fight and they work out from the video evidence and witness statements who was involved. Within a couple of months, they know who brought the weapons and they know where everyone was including Bodrul Miah. Basharath's detention five months after the murder is followed by Nural's visit to Bangladesh. Bodrul Miah is told that his father is under arrest and agrees to return to the UK. He gives himself up at Edmonton Green police station on 8 March 2000. There are five counts on the indictment. Reid and Miah are charged with murdering Abdul Osman; Miah and Aubeelack with wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Mustafa Osman. Miah, Reid, Mollany, Oranu and Aubeelack are charged with violent disorder and Basharath Miah with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The case comes to trial at the Old Bailey on 30 October 2000. Mollany and Oranu plead guilty to violent disorder, having named Miah as the murderer in their police interviews. Their evidence could consequently not be used in court. Abdul Osman had been a bright 18-year-old, one of a family of 10 who had been brought up single-handedly by their mother, Hawa Farah, after their father left them and went to live in the north of England. The family had emigrated to London from the Yemen and had lived in Edmonton for 14 years. The other Somalis in the group, Mustafa Osman, Abdullahi, Hassan and Mohammed, were all close friends or relatives who had known each other for years. None of them was known to be violent. Throughout the trial, the police liaison officer, Bob Kendall, drives Abdul's mother and her daughter Zainab to court, where she sits only a few feet away from the boy accused of murdering her son. The two women come to the Old Bailey every day and during Ramadan they leave the court at noon to say prayers in an upstairs room. I talk to them in the Old Bailey canteen. They tell me that Abdul was no troublemaker, that he had lots of friends and that they miss him dearly because he made his mother smile and she was always happy when he was there. 'The police took us to where he was killed and it was very hard because we walked where he walked. People need to understand the effect the murder of a son has. I wouldn't wish it on anyone in the world.' The trial is a lengthy, solemn, occasionally bad-tempered affair. Senior Treasury Counsel William Boyce, prosecuting, is forced to translate much of the Afro-Caribbean jargon and to meticulously dissect and repeat for the jury every choreographic detail of the fight on Crown Lane and every nuance of the defendants' behaviour. Vera Baird QC defends Miah, who declines to give evidence after Reid is comprehensively filleted by prosecuting counsel. She is forced to rely on a defence of mistaken identity. There is a total of 14 wigs in court and the complexities of the proceedings in the end result in a three-month trial. Miah's rapid disappearance after the fight is explained away as attending a family wedding. But why he flies to Bangladesh and completely changes his appearance on the day he was due in college is impossible to explain away. Reid lies repeatedly in the witness box - to the despair of his counsel, Sally O'Neill. He also claims that he knows none of the other defendants, in spite of the fact that the police formally cautioned him with Miah and Mollany after catching them smoking pot in a car in Epping Forest in April 1999. There is an inevitability about the result. On Tuesday 23 January, after three days' deliberation, the jury convicts Miah of murder, convicts Miah and Aubeelack of attempted wounding, convicts Reid, Mollany, Oranu and Aubeelack of violent disorder and convicts Basharath Miah of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Judge Forrester delays sentencing for a month and expresses great sympathy and admiration for Abdul Osman's family for attending court every day. There is often a sense of anticlimax at the end of a long criminal trial. Barristers and solicitors stand around making small talk and saying goodbye. The brief camaraderie between court staff and the police fragments as the boxes of evidence are carried away to be stored in damp cellars somewhere in the capital, and hacks from the press benches loiter expectantly, trawling for indiscretions. The last days of the trial of Bodrul Miah and his associates are no different. After Basharath Miah and Reid briefly return to face Judge Forrester and have their bail applications rejected, half a dozen members of the police team gather outside the court doors trying to decide where to go for a pint or two. Peter Ship, now promoted to Detective Superintendent, shows no overt sign of triumph. 'It was a difficult operation for us, but our multi-agency approach worked well and we're happy with the result.' Late on the Tuesday afternoon, I watch Abdul Osman's mother and his sister leaving the Old Bailey for the last time and stepping out into an empty world. They talk to me of their gratitude to the police, the witnesses who came forward, the prosecuting counsel; the transient people of the law who had filled the family's lives for a year. But justice does little to heal the wounds of the bereaved and Abdul's mother has persistently refused counselling. Now they are alone with memories of a loved one violently done to death. The judge's comments on the women's dignity and courage and their constant presence in court almost certainly had an effect on the jury's deliberations. But their son and brother had been taken away, simply because a young man had gone to college armed with a knife. It's impossible to know how many lives will be damaged by this one act of stupidity. There were 131,500 serious assaults in London between April 1998 and the end of March 1999. It is not racism which has become endemic in society, it is violence.",

And then it's my turn.</p> <p>I came here seeking a brief escape from the stresses and strains of everyday modern life. But right now my instinctive stress flight response is in full throttle and urging me to sprint for the door, run like hell, anything rather than stand up and perform spontaneous singing and dancing in front of a bunch of complete strangers.</p> <p>But there is no graceful way out. And something about the trance-like beat of the African drums, the unearthly hum of the harmonium, combined with the soothing candle-lit glow of the room and - perhaps most of all - the serene encouragement of our teacher compels me to get up and twirl, stomp, groan and yell like the best of them.</p> <p>By the end of the two-hour session, it feels safe, normal and even cathartic to jump around and sing out in a way most of us have not done since music and movement classes in primary school.</p> <p>This is natural voice therapy. The weekly workshops in north London - and another in southwest London - are meant to release hidden emotions and anxieties, and promote relaxation and mental healing through singing. Using a mixture of mantra, Sanskrit chanting, Indian scales and pure improvisation, coupled with movement and balance drawn from various cultures, the aim is to 'free the inner voice'.</p> <p>According to Nikki Slade, who teaches the classes, singing for the soul is going to become as popular as yoga within the next 10 years. 'Everyone will be doing some form of chanting or singing,' she predicts. 'It will be as important as drinking water.'</p> <p>Of course, singing is already natural to most of us. Whether we do it secretly in the shower or car, or in full public view in church or the football stadium, most of us sing for pleasure. We all know the uplifting boost of singing in harmony with others, while hearing the blues can evoke grief in anyone. But is there more to singing than this transitory change of mood?</p> <p>Slade, a professional singer and actress who took up voice therapy 10 years ago, believes the voice is the key to good mental health. And while the idea may sound a bit kooky, she is fast winning acclaim for her work from mainstream psychiatrists and mental health organisations.</p> <p>'The voice is a powerful instrument, physically, mentally and emotionally,' she says. 'In singing, you are communicating with a higher intuitive awareness that we all have.' She believes singing of any kind - alone or in a group - is therapeutic but that coming together with the explicit intention of using voice to express deep-down emotions can be '10 times as powerful'. She adds: 'I believe in the beginning, there was sound; in the beginning, there was vibration. We are all in an orchestra on this planet.'</p> <p>She is herself testimony to the healing power of song. After spending 10 years singing and acting in the West End, in 1989 she suffered a mental breakdown - or 'psychotic episode' - and spent a month on a psychiatric ward. Singing kept her going. 'The one thing that really mattered was singing,' she recalls. 'I sang every day.' The experience was a watershed. When she recovered, she spent a year training as a 'natural voice coach', then started her own groups.</p> <p>Her workshops and residential weekends now attract people as diverse as computer consultants, architects and office workers. Through voice and movement, Slade seeks to release and develop the emotional needs of each participant. It is not unusual for people to break down in tears during a group, while one woman found a session so liberating she promptly resigned from her much-detested job.</p> <p>'It is completely unique,' says Sarah, 28, a drama therapist who has been coming to the north London group for six weeks. 'I really enjoy the freedom - the combination of voice and body. I think it works at a very deep level. I go away feeling more in touch with myself.'</p> <p>Another regular attender, a receptionist who does not want to be named, adds: 'I think we are getting more and more stressed as people. This is just a place to be really loopy.'</p> <p>But the link between voice and mind may go even deeper. For the past seven years, Slade has been working with a group of people recovering from serious mental-health problems. Set up initially as a form of music therapy for a drop-in centre in Chiswick, the group has now spawned its own band, Carsos, which has just produced its first CD. The sessions began using vocal exercises as a means of communication with people in the group, explains Slade. But over the years, the emotions expressed evolved into a repertoire of songs.</p> <p>Last year, with a \u00a320,000 grant from mental-health charity Mind, and help from professional musicians and recording technicians, Carsos produced its CD, Breakthrough , which contains 13 accomplished and evocative songs. Among the band members is George Noel, who wrote and sings a track called 'Feeling Free'. The meaning of the title becomes clearer once you discover that Noel, who is diagnosed as schizophrenic, was released after a long stretch in Broadmoor high-security hospital eight years ago. Now living in a hostel, he says: 'Music is one of the best methods of communication.'</p> <p>Paul Mathew, another Carsos member and manager of the drop-in centre, has also experienced the healing potential of singing. When he suffered a psychotic breakdown 10 years ago and was incarcerated in Brixton prison for four weeks following a trail of minor crimes, he kept his spirits high by singing his favourite pop songs. 'Singing kept me in touch with myself,' he says. Now recovered, and having retrained as a psychotherapist, he says the voice workshops have made a significant contribution towards helping group members.</p> <p>'It has had an enormously transforming effect,' he says. 'I have seen huge changes in self-esteem, confidence, socialising ability, everything.'</p> <p>Although music therapy has long been used in the NHS to work through various problems with children and adults, it normally involves playing instruments. The value of using the voice for healing is a new idea. But now Slade's work is attracting support from NHS psychiatrists, while Carsos has been invited to perform next summer at the culmination of a year-long festival of the mind and arts hosted by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP).</p> <p>Dr Larry Culliford, a consultant psychiatrist in Brighton, who introduced Slade's work to the college, is a firm supporter. He believes singing works on two levels: by physically encouraging people to breathe and use their whole body better, and emotionally helping them find creative resources.</p> <p>'There are hidden reserves of strength and hope, and indeed happiness, that singing somehow spontaneously helps people to find. It may be this is one of the ways in which mind and body are interrelated.' says Dr Culliford.</p> <p>'One cannot overestimate the value of using your voice in a regular way,' he adds. 'I think it is just a naturally exuberant thing for humans to do.'</p> <p>Another enthusiast is Professor John Cox, president of the RCP, and himself a semi-professional singer - 'a traditional English tenor' - who performs annually at the Edinburgh fringe festival.

      "body": "<p>As the weather vane was to pre-20th-century meteorology, so Madonna is to modern life. Both are in the business of predicting the present. Those twirly birds on church spires told you which way the wind was blowing - the same wind you could feel on your face. Madonna tells us what our favourite fads are. What she does today is what we do, er, today.</p> <p>A valuable public service it is, too. As weather vanes let us peer at them without having to venture into the rain, so Madonna offers us bulletins from the fashionability front that we can scan from the comfort of our favourite chair. She's told us that we like Ali G, that we enjoyed Guy Ritchie's first movie and that we thought cowboy hats should have lasted longer as a high-chic item than they did. Along with us - well me, anyway - she's got a taste for fish'n'chips, likes a good gastro pub and has taken up yoga. Like many of us, she's created her own melange of worship - in her case, part deep Orthodox Jewish, part Highland Fling (in mine, part atheist, part atheist).</p> <p>Now she's playing chess. She has kept the Scottish connection, though. Her coach is the champion of our northern half-brother of a country, Mr Alan Norris, an edgy man based in London who is starting to get fed up with phone calls from people like me. 'It's not about Madonna, is it?' he said, clearly not intending to reveal any details.</p> <p>'Not necessarily,' I hedged. While I'd have been fascinated to hear about Madonna's chess life - does she puts on a kilt to castle? - I wanted to know whether Madonna's taste for the ancient Eastern board game was a true reflection of our current enthusiasms. Or has she stopped being the weatherperson who tells us which way the wind is blowing? Is chess becoming an acceptable pastime? Is it severing its umbilical link with the dandruffed, the obsessive and the young-men-with-nervous-laughs? (I used to play. I know.) 'Well,' said Mr Norris. 'I'm getting busier, if that's anything to go by.'</p> <p>There is other stuff to go by. Chess is also being played by other people with one name, Bono and Sting. And by a roll call of celebrities - ie Stephen Fry, Steve Martin, Guy Ritchie, Greta Scacchi, Chris Evans, Lennox Lewis, Martin Amis and snooker player Steve Davis, president of the British Chess Federation. Madonna plays at the Bel Air chess club along with Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts.</p> <p>So is all this chess-as-fashion stuff just hooey? It's certainly Hoey. Talk to anyone in a chess organisation and they will complain that chess is not recognised as a sport in the UK, which means no Lottery money, even for Braille chess. So they are lobbying the minister for sport, Kate Hoey. Nick Hawkins is a pretty good chess player - graded at 187, compared to a club average of 117. He's a marketing director of the British Chess Federation. He says chess is certainly becoming more popular. The BCF gives a figure of 4m who can play the game and 40,000 club members - a 25 per cent rise from the previous day, when the London Chess Centre suggested 3m players. 'Chess was fashionable in the 20s,' said Hawkins, 'when the world champion was a US-based Cuban, Jos\u00e9 Raoul Capablanca. Another big player was the star of Capablanca.'</p> <p>Capablanca ? 'Sorry, Casablanca . You can see Bogart was a chess player because he moves the pieces correctly. Then Kasparov's success made it fashionable in the 70s.' And now? 'More young people than ever play it.' Two of them are Martin Amis's sons.</p> <p>What is chess's new attraction? 'It's linked to the revolution in attitudes towards our bodies,' said Chris Duncan of the London Chess Centre. 'People have concentrated on physical fitness in the gym. Now they're looking for fitness of mind.'</p> <p>Hawkins developed this thought. 'Madonna has a high IQ and likes to exercise control. She can develop her skills and work on strategic control.' As a lecturer, Nick finds that chess-playing work is directly correlated to quality of academic work. In a world where Bill Gates has become that rich, demonstrating your brain power by playing chess is scarcely an idiotic option.</p> <p>Finally, I checked in with Robert, an old friend who used to be something of a chess fiend.

      "bodyText": "As the weather vane was to pre-20th-century meteorology, so Madonna is to modern life. Both are in the business of predicting the present. Those twirly birds on church spires told you which way the wind was blowing - the same wind you could feel on your face. Madonna tells us what our favourite fads are. What she does today is what we do, er, today. A valuable public service it is, too. As weather vanes let us peer at them without having to venture into the rain, so Madonna offers us bulletins from the fashionability front that we can scan from the comfort of our favourite chair. She's told us that we like Ali G, that we enjoyed Guy Ritchie's first movie and that we thought cowboy hats should have lasted longer as a high-chic item than they did. Along with us - well me, anyway - she's got a taste for fish'n'chips, likes a good gastro pub and has taken up yoga. Like many of us, she's created her own melange of worship - in her case, part deep Orthodox Jewish, part Highland Fling (in mine, part atheist, part atheist). Now she's playing chess. She has kept the Scottish connection, though. Her coach is the champion of our northern half-brother of a country, Mr Alan Norris, an edgy man based in London who is starting to get fed up with phone calls from people like me. 'It's not about Madonna, is it?' he said, clearly not intending to reveal any details. 'Not necessarily,' I hedged. While I'd have been fascinated to hear about Madonna's chess life - does she puts on a kilt to castle? - I wanted to know whether Madonna's taste for the ancient Eastern board game was a true reflection of our current enthusiasms. Or has she stopped being the weatherperson who tells us which way the wind is blowing? Is chess becoming an acceptable pastime? Is it severing its umbilical link with the dandruffed, the obsessive and the young-men-with-nervous-laughs? (I used to play. I know.) 'Well,' said Mr Norris. 'I'm getting busier, if that's anything to go by.' There is other stuff to go by. Chess is also being played by other people with one name, Bono and Sting. And by a roll call of celebrities - ie Stephen Fry, Steve Martin, Guy Ritchie, Greta Scacchi, Chris Evans, Lennox Lewis, Martin Amis and snooker player Steve Davis, president of the British Chess Federation. Madonna plays at the Bel Air chess club along with Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts. So is all this chess-as-fashion stuff just hooey? It's certainly Hoey. Talk to anyone in a chess organisation and they will complain that chess is not recognised as a sport in the UK, which means no Lottery money, even for Braille chess. So they are lobbying the minister for sport, Kate Hoey. Nick Hawkins is a pretty good chess player - graded at 187, compared to a club average of 117. He's a marketing director of the British Chess Federation. He says chess is certainly becoming more popular. The BCF gives a figure of 4m who can play the game and 40,000 club members - a 25 per cent rise from the previous day, when the London Chess Centre suggested 3m players. 'Chess was fashionable in the 20s,' said Hawkins, 'when the world champion was a US-based Cuban, Jos\u00e9 Raoul Capablanca. Another big player was the star of Capablanca.' Capablanca ? 'Sorry, Casablanca . You can see Bogart was a chess player because he moves the pieces correctly. Then Kasparov's success made it fashionable in the 70s.' And now? 'More young people than ever play it.' Two of them are Martin Amis's sons. What is chess's new attraction? 'It's linked to the revolution in attitudes towards our bodies,' said Chris Duncan of the London Chess Centre. 'People have concentrated on physical fitness in the gym. Now they're looking for fitness of mind.' Hawkins developed this thought. 'Madonna has a high IQ and likes to exercise control. She can develop her skills and work on strategic control.' As a lecturer, Nick finds that chess-playing work is directly correlated to quality of academic work. In a world where Bill Gates has become that rich, demonstrating your brain power by playing chess is scarcely an idiotic option. Finally, I checked in with Robert, an old friend who used to be something of a chess fiend. What's he up to now? 'As we speak,' he said, 'I'm in chessclub.com.' He was playing chess with someone somewhere else who was masquerading under a false name. What's it like, Robert? 'Really good. Love it. It's like anonymous sex.' Inspired, I surfed the virtual-chess world. I found an active, slightly nerdy but fun subculture: clips of TS Eliot reading A Game Of Chess , downloads of the two Madonna videos which feature the game.

      "byline": "Barbara Ellen",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I might be a dried up old battle-axe now, but, in my 'yoof', I was 'hot' - hot enough to be denounced as a groupie. It dates back to the days when I used to staple squawking diatribes together, call them 'fanzines' and sell them at gigs to punters I liked the look of. Forcing my photocopied 'masterpieces' upon doe-eyed boys in crumpled Wire T-shirts was my first taste of 'career fulfilment.' Crucially, although I loved music, I wasn't particularly interested in musicians, probably realising even then that the only reason 90 per cent of guys joined bands was because they were so radioactively ugly there was no other way they were ever going to get laid. Not that this attitude made any difference. </p> <p>However much one insisted that it was music one loved not musicians, one invariably got saddled with a reputation as a slut who'd do anything for a backstage pass. Just being seen in the same vicinity as goons with guitars was enough to make you 'a sure thing'. Women hanging around musicians meant only one thing - they were groupies, not to be taken seriously. Around this time, I was always coming across girls sobbing in the loos: because the guitarist they'd slept with in Hull wasn't keen to continue the 'relationship' in Bath. Watching these heartbroken, naive girls practically succumbing to the vapours was pure John Peel-meets-Jane Austen. Here, ladies and gentlemen, were your so-called hardened 'groupies'. </p> <p>That's why Cameron Crowe's new movie, Almost Famous, made me sigh. In many ways, it's a fabulous movie, based on Crowe's own experiences as a youthful rock critic for Rolling Stone magazine in the 70s. The problem is Kate Hudson's sweet but coy turn as Penny Lane, the self-styled 'band aid', and Happy Groupie, who considers herself to be equal to the musicians she beds. This character is based in part on infamous rock groupie Pamela Des Barres, who romanced, among others, Frank Zappa, Keith Moon and Jimmy Page. In her memoir, I'm With the Band, Des Barres comes across as being as nice as she is deluded. In her mind, she was her paramours' 'tour wife', their lover and 'muse'. In reality, of course, she was little more than a sex snack with portfolio. </p> <p>At least Miss Pamela was treated 'real nice'. Reading the seminal Led Zeppelin biography, Hammer of the Gods, it becomes clear that the majority of, often underaged, real-life groupies from the Almost Famous era, were viciously sexually exploited and abused, unlike Penny Lane, who is shown being 'sexually exploited and abused' in a rather gentle, nurturing, photogenic fashion. I thought at first that I was overreacting as a 'woman' (and a humourless one at that) until I spoke with a respected male rock critic from the time, who commented, unprompted, upon the movie's 'sanitisation' of the twisted mores of the era. This confirmed my belief that that evergreen sexual icon of rock culture, the 'Happy Groupie' (the emancipated good time gal who knows the score and just wants to get laid) is all but a myth. </p> <p>The Happy Groupie no longer exists in the rock world, if she ever really did in any significant numbers. In reality, the 'Happy Groupie' is just another of those male-generated myths, which gives men the licence to behave abusively and somehow get applauded for it. Men, bless them, are always trying to con women into believing they should feel honoured to be allowed to have sex with them, but only rock stars, movie stars and footballers have ever got away with it. It's worth remembering that, when they've got away with it, it has mainly been with the young and naive (who couldn't hope to know the score), rather than the experienced and liberated (who do). </p> <p>The fact that the Happy Groupie remains such a powerful misogynistic icon also says a lot about male wannabes in the rock industry. The fallacy being that only women are groupies. Chrissie Hynde might rightly roar with laughter at the thought of male groupies making themselves 'available' but the fact is that they do exist, just not in an overtly sexualised way, and not only for female stars. For, contrary to popular belief, men love to hang around rock stars, they might even covertly want to sleep with them, they just don't get the chance. That's where all those drug dealers, hangers on, and other jealous woman-denigrating saddos come from. When people talk sneeringly of 'groupies', they think only of women. But I've seen male drug dealers and hangers on passed around rock star circles as cavalierly and disrespectfully as any girls. It would seem that, of all groupies, male ones have the potential to be the unhappiest of all.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "I might be a dried up old battle-axe now, but, in my 'yoof', I was 'hot' - hot enough to be denounced as a groupie. It dates back to the days when I used to staple squawking diatribes together, call them 'fanzines' and sell them at gigs to punters I liked the look of. Forcing my photocopied 'masterpieces' upon doe-eyed boys in crumpled Wire T-shirts was my first taste of 'career fulfilment.' Crucially, although I loved music, I wasn't particularly interested in musicians, probably realising even then that the only reason 90 per cent of guys joined bands was because they were so radioactively ugly there was no other way they were ever going to get laid. Not that this attitude made any difference. However much one insisted that it was music one loved not musicians, one invariably got saddled with a reputation as a slut who'd do anything for a backstage pass. Just being seen in the same vicinity as goons with guitars was enough to make you 'a sure thing'. Women hanging around musicians meant only one thing - they were groupies, not to be taken seriously. Around this time, I was always coming across girls sobbing in the loos: because the guitarist they'd slept with in Hull wasn't keen to continue the 'relationship' in Bath. Watching these heartbroken, naive girls practically succumbing to the vapours was pure John Peel-meets-Jane Austen. Here, ladies and gentlemen, were your so-called hardened 'groupies'. That's why Cameron Crowe's new movie, Almost Famous, made me sigh. In many ways, it's a fabulous movie, based on Crowe's own experiences as a youthful rock critic for Rolling Stone magazine in the 70s. The problem is Kate Hudson's sweet but coy turn as Penny Lane, the self-styled 'band aid', and Happy Groupie, who considers herself to be equal to the musicians she beds. This character is based in part on infamous rock groupie Pamela Des Barres, who romanced, among others, Frank Zappa, Keith Moon and Jimmy Page. In her memoir, I'm With the Band, Des Barres comes across as being as nice as she is deluded. In her mind, she was her paramours' 'tour wife', their lover and 'muse'. In reality, of course, she was little more than a sex snack with portfolio. At least Miss Pamela was treated 'real nice'. Reading the seminal Led Zeppelin biography, Hammer of the Gods, it becomes clear that the majority of, often underaged, real-life groupies from the Almost Famous era, were viciously sexually exploited and abused, unlike Penny Lane, who is shown being 'sexually exploited and abused' in a rather gentle, nurturing, photogenic fashion. I thought at first that I was overreacting as a 'woman' (and a humourless one at that) until I spoke with a respected male rock critic from the time, who commented, unprompted, upon the movie's 'sanitisation' of the twisted mores of the era. This confirmed my belief that that evergreen sexual icon of rock culture, the 'Happy Groupie' (the emancipated good time gal who knows the score and just wants to get laid) is all but a myth. The Happy Groupie no longer exists in the rock world, if she ever really did in any significant numbers. In reality, the 'Happy Groupie' is just another of those male-generated myths, which gives men the licence to behave abusively and somehow get applauded for it. Men, bless them, are always trying to con women into believing they should feel honoured to be allowed to have sex with them, but only rock stars, movie stars and footballers have ever got away with it. It's worth remembering that, when they've got away with it, it has mainly been with the young and naive (who couldn't hope to know the score), rather than the experienced and liberated (who do). The fact that the Happy Groupie remains such a powerful misogynistic icon also says a lot about male wannabes in the rock industry. The fallacy being that only women are groupies. Chrissie Hynde might rightly roar with laughter at the thought of male groupies making themselves 'available' but the fact is that they do exist, just not in an overtly sexualised way, and not only for female stars. For, contrary to popular belief, men love to hang around rock stars, they might even covertly want to sleep with them, they just don't get the chance. That's where all those drug dealers, hangers on, and other jealous woman-denigrating saddos come from. When people talk sneeringly of 'groupies', they think only of women. But I've seen male drug dealers and hangers on passed around rock star circles as cavalierly and disrespectfully as any girls. It would seem that, of all groupies, male ones have the potential to be the unhappiest of all. barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>It is hard to believe that, a decade ago, few investors even questioned the charges they had to pay every time they put money into a new Pep or unit trust. What many came to realise was that, with around 5 per cent of their money going straight into the coffers of those who sold them the investment, their investment would do well to more than tread water during the first year.</p> <p>The arrival of discount brokers changed all that as a new wave of lean and hungry intermediaries calculated that they could return most of the commission they were paid by the fund management group, and still make a handsome profit.</p> <p>Nowadays, the picture has become far more confusing for the investor: there are many more options available to anyone looking for a cut-price deal, but the level of advice or service you receive with each of them can vary enormously.</p> <p>The way discounting works is this: fund management groups set an initial charge for each of their funds, of which the average is around 5 per cent. If the fund is sold via an intermediary, they usually receive 3 per cent commission from the fund manager; but discount brokers rebate their initial commission to the investor, reducing the charge to you to around 2 per cent. However, fund managers often offer their own discount against the initial charge of, say, 1 per cent or 2 per cent. (If you buy direct from the fund manager, this is the only reduction you will get.) So with luck, the slice of your initial investment that is not usefully invested is whittled down to 1 per cent or less.</p> <p>Until a year or two ago, most intermediaries offering such deals usually did so on an 'execution only' basis, meaning you had to know which fund you wanted, because there was no advice on offer. And they were content to rely on the annual renewal commission - typically 0.5 per cent - from the fund manager in order to make a living.</p> <p>Some intermediaries then began offering discounts as well as advice; and another camp honed the charges down even further, by rebating some of their annual renewal commission to investors. And as if that were not confusing enough, along came 'fund supermarkets', a new type of internet-based service where you can mix and match funds in your Isa, again at reduced charges.</p> <p>According to Jason Hollands, deputy managing director of London-based intermediary Bestinvest, there is not much to choose between the discounts offered by most brokers. The difference, he says, is in the level of service and advice that you receive. </p> <p>'Everyone is now on a pretty flat price structure, giving everything back upfront,' he says.

      "bodyText": "It is hard to believe that, a decade ago, few investors even questioned the charges they had to pay every time they put money into a new Pep or unit trust. What many came to realise was that, with around 5 per cent of their money going straight into the coffers of those who sold them the investment, their investment would do well to more than tread water during the first year. The arrival of discount brokers changed all that as a new wave of lean and hungry intermediaries calculated that they could return most of the commission they were paid by the fund management group, and still make a handsome profit. Nowadays, the picture has become far more confusing for the investor: there are many more options available to anyone looking for a cut-price deal, but the level of advice or service you receive with each of them can vary enormously. The way discounting works is this: fund management groups set an initial charge for each of their funds, of which the average is around 5 per cent. If the fund is sold via an intermediary, they usually receive 3 per cent commission from the fund manager; but discount brokers rebate their initial commission to the investor, reducing the charge to you to around 2 per cent. However, fund managers often offer their own discount against the initial charge of, say, 1 per cent or 2 per cent. (If you buy direct from the fund manager, this is the only reduction you will get.) So with luck, the slice of your initial investment that is not usefully invested is whittled down to 1 per cent or less. Until a year or two ago, most intermediaries offering such deals usually did so on an 'execution only' basis, meaning you had to know which fund you wanted, because there was no advice on offer. And they were content to rely on the annual renewal commission - typically 0.5 per cent - from the fund manager in order to make a living. Some intermediaries then began offering discounts as well as advice; and another camp honed the charges down even further, by rebating some of their annual renewal commission to investors. And as if that were not confusing enough, along came 'fund supermarkets', a new type of internet-based service where you can mix and match funds in your Isa, again at reduced charges. According to Jason Hollands, deputy managing director of London-based intermediary Bestinvest, there is not much to choose between the discounts offered by most brokers. The difference, he says, is in the level of service and advice that you receive. 'Everyone is now on a pretty flat price structure, giving everything back upfront,' he says. 'But we are the only discount broker in the UK which also gives advice.' As well as individual recommendations, Bestinvest offers clients a quarterly review of their portfolio, with advice on the overall structure as well as individual funds; it also supplies regular research bulletins. A different tack has been taken by Bath-based Chartwell, which has been locked in a dispute with fund manager Fidelity over its offer to refund half of the annual renewal commission to investors, in addition to initial commission. Fidelity threatened to stop dealing with Chartwell, some believe under pressure from other intermediaries, but has now agreed to discuss the issue. What Chartwell's offer means is that you pay only a flat fee of \u00a320 for transacting each deal in addition to any initial charge which is not discounted, and each year you will receive a cheque for half of the renewal commission. If your Isa investment stood at \u00a37,000, and the renewal commission is 0.5 per cent, that means your cheque in the first year would be for \u00a317.50. As Chartwell's Tim Cockerill points out: 'Over a period of time, that will easily cover the initial fee.' Like many discount brokers, Chartwell offers the option of providing advice on choosing a fund. In its case, it charges a flat fee of \u00a3150 for a consultation, which is still considerably less expensive than the \u00a3350 somebody paying a 5 per cent initial charge on a \u00a37,000 Isa would have to cough up. And they can then take advantage of the best discounts available to make their investment. Cockerill stresses that, in spite of its stand on discounts, people should be very wary of simply looking for the cheapest deal. 'I think the discount story has gone as far as it can go,' he says, adding: 'A lot of people still don't know what they want and need advice.'

The arrest fuels a growing belief that UN officials, diplomats and humanitarian aid workers are now among the biggest buyers of African ivory. The UN official was named by the local press as Lt-Col Masud Mohamed. He was in transit, waiting to board a flight to Dubai - one of the busiest staging posts for endangered African animal parts - when stopped by police. Kenya Airports Commandant Christopher Isoe said that when confronted with the police's suspicions, Mohamed, a Pakistani national, attempted to claim diplomatic immunity. But, unimpressed, airport police opened his suitcases and are alleged to have found four tusks, a dozen pieces of worked ivory and a leopard skin. 'The man is not a visitor to Kenya and there is nothing like diplomatic immunity for him,' Isoe said. Mohamed was taken straight to Nairobi Magistrates Court, but refused to enter a plea. He will reappear in court tomorrow. Mohamed's case could have been lifted straight from last year's report by the UK-based organisation, Save the Elephants (STE). 'We spent six months following the ivory trade all over Africa, and it became clear that UN workers and diplomats - mainly from North Korea - have become one of the biggest markets for ivory,' said Dr Esmond Martin, one of the report's co-authors.

      "body": "<p>For 27 years, the small town of Bakewell has been living with guilt. Children born long after the horrific events of that chilly, sunny day cheerfully rattle off the tale of the young woman with questionable morals who was murdered in the graveyard on the edge of town and how a gentle, mentally disabled boy was fitted up for the crime.</p> <p>But their parents speak more softly, describing how they bumped into one of the real murderers just last week at the local supermarket and how these men, with blood three decades old still on their hands, continue to laugh openly at the law and torment the families of the bereaved for kicks.</p> <p>The 1973 murder of Wendy Sewell, the woman dubbed the Bakewell Tart with a taste for illicit, outdoor sex who slipped Mars Bars into the hands of men who took her fancy - an unmistakeable sexual signal for those who had lived through the Sixties - hit the headlines again last week.</p> <p>Stephen Downing, victim of Britain's longest alleged miscarriage of justice, was a bewildered boy when he disappeared into jail all those years ago, tearfully protesting his innocence.</p> <p>He is now a middle-aged man with the lowered eyes and bowed shoulders of one who has spent his formative adult years being beaten into submission alongside some of Britain's most notorious murderers. As his parents field phone calls from neighbours and read out letters of congratulations from supporters in their neat front room, Downing fiddles with intense, childlike fascination with gadgets that were undreamt of in his small town at the time of his incarceration - the television remote control is a revelation to him - while the idea of going out for a pint is so novel as to leave him bewildered.</p> <p>But although Bakewell turned out in force to greet Downing with undisguised delight when he returned home to the tiny, genteel town last Wednesday, his release has only served to replace the millstone of collective guilt they have carried around their necks for three decades with another, heavier burden.</p> <p>Because they know three things: that they stood by while a child was incarcerated despite incontrovertible evidence pointing to his innocence; that the true killers still live among them and could be responsible for at least two other murders; and that, despite their genuine delight at seeing Downing finally walk free, his name has been cleared only because one man devoted six years of his life fighting for justice in the teeth of attempts on his life, more death threats than he bothered to count, malicious gossiping intended to soil his name and apathetic silence.</p> <p>Don Hale, the editor of the local newspaper, is Bakewell's real-life Poirot. From the day six years ago when Downing's parents contacted him in a frenzy of anticipation after receiving an anonymous letter from a woman claiming to have sent Hale new information that could clear their son's name, he has not faltered.</p> <p>'Initially, I didn't want to touch the case,' he admits, directing his slight, bemused smile down at the table and toying with his glasses in gentle, modest mannerisms that belie the ferocious determination which has seen him triumph over the might of the Debyshire police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Government itself.</p> <p>'It seemed like a crazy thing to do.

It was also where Sewell, with her taste for outdoor sex, came to meet boyfriends during the two-hour lunch breaks she regularly took from her local secretarial job in the Forestry Commission.</p> <p>'She didn't conceal what she did during those lunchbreaks,' claimed a local who lived near Sewell on the outskirts of the town. 'She never tried to hide what she was like, there was no point: it was a small town and everyone knew what she was at.'</p> <p>There is plenty of evidence that Sewell was not shy: other locals relate how, when her husband used to leave for work in the mornings, she would turn a light on in the porch to signal that the coast was clear. During one of the couple's many break-ups, she rented a room over a wool shop where she met men until she was asked to leave. When she gave birth to a son and had it adopted, at least three men believed themselves to be the father.</p> <p>Sewell and her husband, David, had forged some sort of reconciliation at the time of her murder and were once again living under the same roof. There is no indication that she had tempered her behaviour, however, and colleagues remember how she spoke about an argument she had had with her current boyfriend the night before she disappeared.</p> <p>At 12pm, she received a phonecall or a visit in the office and her boss, on the phone in the other room, remembered hearing raised voices before Sewell popped in with a note telling him she was nipping out for lunch. A friend who met her rushing up the hill a few minutes later said Sewell was excited and indicated that she was on her way to meet her boyfriend to make up after having argued.</p> <p>At 1pm, Downing stoked the fire in the chapel, slung his coat around his shoulders and headed home to feed the two baby hedgehogs he had rescued and have a bite of lunch with his mother. As he walked up the long path from the back of the graveyard to the front entrance, he later told police he remembered seeing Wendy striding back and forth behind the chapel on a parallel path, close to the wood.</p> <p>He took no notice and walked on. Five witnesses saw him leaving the graveyard at this time with his characteristic unhurried, shambling gait and by the time his mother returned home not more than seven minutes later Downing had already boiled the kettle and was in the garage, changing his boots.</p> <p>At around 1.20pm, Downing left home and, waving to the man in the graveyard gatehouse, walked back to the shed. No more than five minutes later, he was back, hammering on the gatehouse door and shouting about a woman who had been attacked.</p> <p>His return coincided with the arrival of three workmen who went with him to where he had left Sewell. She was still alive and, at their approach, got to her feet and began stumbling around. The men watched as she tripped and fell, smashing her head against a gravestone. Hale believes it was this final fall that killed her: had she been restrained or lain still, her life might never have ended and Downing's nightmare would never have begun.</p> <p>She was still alive by the time the police and ambulance arrived but was unconsious by the time she reached the hospital. Downing was pulled in immediately for questioning, although the police insisted he was merely helping them out - he was neither cautioned nor allowed a solicitor. The boy, already in a state of severe shock, was questioned for nine hours.</p> <p>Downstairs, they sent away his father, who arrived six times to pick up his son. They wrote out a confession in pencil full of words Downing didn't understand, saying he had murdered Sewell and sexually attacked her between 12.50pm and 1.08pm, which they eventually persuaded him to sign in ink. By the time Sewell died two days later without regaining consciousness, Downing was bang to rights.</p> <p>After being contacted by Downing's parents, Hale started his investigation by simply knocking on the doors of houses overlooking the graveyard and almost immediately struck gold - an old woman greeted him with open arms: 'I'm so glad someone is finally doing something about this,' she said, ushering him into the house.</p> <p>She had seen a van parked outside the front of the graveyard at the time of the murder and had noted two men behaving in a unusual manner. She had written down the registration number and description of the men on the back of a cigarette packet and taken it to the police station but had been told to go away.</p> <p>Hale asked her if she still had the notes taken on the day of the murder and unbelievably she opened a drawer full of clutter and pulled out the cigarette packet.</p> <p>'It was beyond belief, 22 years she'd kept that box,' said Hale. 'It was yellowed and dusty but still completely legible - and damning to the police case.'</p> <p>Hale had the registration number traced and found that it belonged to another man known to Sewell, the man she'd been on her way to meet that day.</p> <p>When Hale took the case back to court to ask for an appeal, he was turned down. But then came his second stroke of luck. In a village miles away, Jane Atkins, a young girl at the time of the murder who had run away from home shortly afterwards, happened to read about the case in a local paper left in a restaurant where she was waiting on tables.</p> <p>She contacted Hale and revealed that on the day of the murder, she had entered the graveyard from the back just after the one o'clock news had ended and seen Downing leaving at the front - she had recognised his walk.</p> <p>As she walked through the graveyard, she saw Sewell alive and well in the arms of her boyfriend, a well-known local businessman.

Some of these people had approached the police and been turned away and others had covered their eyes and ears to Downing's plight.</p> <p>As Hale dug, more scum rose to the surface. A man covered in blood had been seen by numerous witnesses running from the scene of the crime, identified by many at the time, but the police didn't want to know.</p> <p>As Hale started peeling back the layers, certain people began to get nervous.

      "bodyText": "For 27 years, the small town of Bakewell has been living with guilt. Children born long after the horrific events of that chilly, sunny day cheerfully rattle off the tale of the young woman with questionable morals who was murdered in the graveyard on the edge of town and how a gentle, mentally disabled boy was fitted up for the crime. But their parents speak more softly, describing how they bumped into one of the real murderers just last week at the local supermarket and how these men, with blood three decades old still on their hands, continue to laugh openly at the law and torment the families of the bereaved for kicks. The 1973 murder of Wendy Sewell, the woman dubbed the Bakewell Tart with a taste for illicit, outdoor sex who slipped Mars Bars into the hands of men who took her fancy - an unmistakeable sexual signal for those who had lived through the Sixties - hit the headlines again last week. Stephen Downing, victim of Britain's longest alleged miscarriage of justice, was a bewildered boy when he disappeared into jail all those years ago, tearfully protesting his innocence. He is now a middle-aged man with the lowered eyes and bowed shoulders of one who has spent his formative adult years being beaten into submission alongside some of Britain's most notorious murderers. As his parents field phone calls from neighbours and read out letters of congratulations from supporters in their neat front room, Downing fiddles with intense, childlike fascination with gadgets that were undreamt of in his small town at the time of his incarceration - the television remote control is a revelation to him - while the idea of going out for a pint is so novel as to leave him bewildered. But although Bakewell turned out in force to greet Downing with undisguised delight when he returned home to the tiny, genteel town last Wednesday, his release has only served to replace the millstone of collective guilt they have carried around their necks for three decades with another, heavier burden. Because they know three things: that they stood by while a child was incarcerated despite incontrovertible evidence pointing to his innocence; that the true killers still live among them and could be responsible for at least two other murders; and that, despite their genuine delight at seeing Downing finally walk free, his name has been cleared only because one man devoted six years of his life fighting for justice in the teeth of attempts on his life, more death threats than he bothered to count, malicious gossiping intended to soil his name and apathetic silence. Don Hale, the editor of the local newspaper, is Bakewell's real-life Poirot. From the day six years ago when Downing's parents contacted him in a frenzy of anticipation after receiving an anonymous letter from a woman claiming to have sent Hale new information that could clear their son's name, he has not faltered. 'Initially, I didn't want to touch the case,' he admits, directing his slight, bemused smile down at the table and toying with his glasses in gentle, modest mannerisms that belie the ferocious determination which has seen him triumph over the might of the Debyshire police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Government itself. 'It seemed like a crazy thing to do. The case had been done and dusted for 30 years, but when I tried to prove Stephen's guilt instead, I came across so many inconsistencies, faults and downright falsehoods in the prosecution's case that it could only point to one thing: the boy's absolute innocence.' The graveyard where Wendy Sewell was bludgeoned to death in a vicious and frenzied attack during her lunch hour on 12 September 1973 sits high up on the Derbyshire hillside, its wild ivy-covered trees and sculpted yew hedges casting a lowering, Gothic shadow over the town that spreads out in the valley below. It was here that Downing, a 17-year-old boy with a reading age of 11 who had never had a girlfriend and kept hedgehogs in his garden shed, worked doing odd jobs in the deconsecrated chapel. It was also where Sewell, with her taste for outdoor sex, came to meet boyfriends during the two-hour lunch breaks she regularly took from her local secretarial job in the Forestry Commission. 'She didn't conceal what she did during those lunchbreaks,' claimed a local who lived near Sewell on the outskirts of the town. 'She never tried to hide what she was like, there was no point: it was a small town and everyone knew what she was at.' There is plenty of evidence that Sewell was not shy: other locals relate how, when her husband used to leave for work in the mornings, she would turn a light on in the porch to signal that the coast was clear. During one of the couple's many break-ups, she rented a room over a wool shop where she met men until she was asked to leave. When she gave birth to a son and had it adopted, at least three men believed themselves to be the father. Sewell and her husband, David, had forged some sort of reconciliation at the time of her murder and were once again living under the same roof. There is no indication that she had tempered her behaviour, however, and colleagues remember how she spoke about an argument she had had with her current boyfriend the night before she disappeared. At 12pm, she received a phonecall or a visit in the office and her boss, on the phone in the other room, remembered hearing raised voices before Sewell popped in with a note telling him she was nipping out for lunch. A friend who met her rushing up the hill a few minutes later said Sewell was excited and indicated that she was on her way to meet her boyfriend to make up after having argued.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As a teenager, Joe Decker was an overweight couch potato. He devoured beer, pizza and Twinkies, took no exercise and saw his weight balloon. When he joined the US army, his inability to run two miles in 16 minutes meant he had to endure the humiliation of extra training in the 'fat boy programme'.</p> <p>Yet last week Joe Decker was named the world's fittest man after completing the most gruelling physical challenge on earth in a record time. In the space of 24 hours, and without stopping to sleep, he ran, cycled and swam further, did more muscle-busting exercises and lifted far heavier weights than the previous winner of the Physical Fitness Challenge.</p> <p>Scarred by endless jibes about his weight, 30-year-old Decker is now enjoying the title bestowed on him by Guinness World Records, the ultimate authority on incredible feats. Last week they named him 'the work-out king of the world'. Where once he had layers of unwanted blubber, now he has lean, honed muscle.</p> <p>Decker's tilt at the title began with a 100-mile cycle ride and 10 miles each of running, hiking and rowing, moved on to five miles of powerwalking, six miles kayaking and a two-mile swim. He then completed another 10 miles on a skiing machine, 3,000 abdominal crunches, 1,100 jumping jacks, 1,000 leg-lifts and 1,100 push-ups and finally ended with a three-hour gym session in which he lifted 278,540lbs in weights. Incredibly he did all 13 events back-to-back, never stopping once to rest, much less sleep.</p> <p>Chris Sheedy of Guinness World Records said: 'His achievement is momentous, unbelievable, superhuman. When his letter arrived I thought, \"to do all this in such a short time isn't physically possible\". But he sent us videos, eyewitness statements, doctors' reports - more evidence than we needed to validate his claim. It's as well he did, otherwise I wouldn't have believed he'd done it all.'</p> <p>The previous record-holder, Steve Sokol of San Jose, California, took 23 hours and 43 minutes in August 1998 to complete all 13 challenges. Decker matched or bettered Sokol's achievements in 22 hours, then spent two hours lifting more and more weights in a bid to ensure that whoever tries to outdo him will have to demonstrate almost bionic capabilities. Competition rules say any successful challenger must equal all the holder's feats, and improve on at least one.</p> <p>Decker, from Illinois, is no ordinary athlete. From Monday to Friday he gets up at 4.45am and from 5.30 leads a 90-minute class for serious fitness fanatics. After a quick breakfast he heads to the gym for several hours, then spends the rest of the day taking classes - always outdoors, come rain, snow or sunshine - and running his own business advising companies on employee health. For a bit of light relief, he runs 20-50 miles on a Saturday and cycles up to 100 miles on Sunday. His tee-shirt bears the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's dictum 'what does not kill me makes me stronger'.</p> <p>Pain and suffering do not worry him. He rates his training work outs from one to 10 on a personal 'nausea scale'. Several times a week he does an eight or a nine, just short of 'full-blown hurling'.</p> <p>Decker is always looking for new ways of testing his limits.

      "bodyText": "As a teenager, Joe Decker was an overweight couch potato. He devoured beer, pizza and Twinkies, took no exercise and saw his weight balloon. When he joined the US army, his inability to run two miles in 16 minutes meant he had to endure the humiliation of extra training in the 'fat boy programme'. Yet last week Joe Decker was named the world's fittest man after completing the most gruelling physical challenge on earth in a record time. In the space of 24 hours, and without stopping to sleep, he ran, cycled and swam further, did more muscle-busting exercises and lifted far heavier weights than the previous winner of the Physical Fitness Challenge. Scarred by endless jibes about his weight, 30-year-old Decker is now enjoying the title bestowed on him by Guinness World Records, the ultimate authority on incredible feats. Last week they named him 'the work-out king of the world'. Where once he had layers of unwanted blubber, now he has lean, honed muscle. Decker's tilt at the title began with a 100-mile cycle ride and 10 miles each of running, hiking and rowing, moved on to five miles of powerwalking, six miles kayaking and a two-mile swim. He then completed another 10 miles on a skiing machine, 3,000 abdominal crunches, 1,100 jumping jacks, 1,000 leg-lifts and 1,100 push-ups and finally ended with a three-hour gym session in which he lifted 278,540lbs in weights. Incredibly he did all 13 events back-to-back, never stopping once to rest, much less sleep. Chris Sheedy of Guinness World Records said: 'His achievement is momentous, unbelievable, superhuman. When his letter arrived I thought, \"to do all this in such a short time isn't physically possible\". But he sent us videos, eyewitness statements, doctors' reports - more evidence than we needed to validate his claim. It's as well he did, otherwise I wouldn't have believed he'd done it all.' The previous record-holder, Steve Sokol of San Jose, California, took 23 hours and 43 minutes in August 1998 to complete all 13 challenges. Decker matched or bettered Sokol's achievements in 22 hours, then spent two hours lifting more and more weights in a bid to ensure that whoever tries to outdo him will have to demonstrate almost bionic capabilities. Competition rules say any successful challenger must equal all the holder's feats, and improve on at least one. Decker, from Illinois, is no ordinary athlete. From Monday to Friday he gets up at 4.45am and from 5.30 leads a 90-minute class for serious fitness fanatics. After a quick breakfast he heads to the gym for several hours, then spends the rest of the day taking classes - always outdoors, come rain, snow or sunshine - and running his own business advising companies on employee health. For a bit of light relief, he runs 20-50 miles on a Saturday and cycles up to 100 miles on Sunday. His tee-shirt bears the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche's dictum 'what does not kill me makes me stronger'. Pain and suffering do not worry him. He rates his training work outs from one to 10 on a personal 'nausea scale'. Several times a week he does an eight or a nine, just short of 'full-blown hurling'. Decker is always looking for new ways of testing his limits. His favourites are ultra-marathons and adventure challenges. He has experienced hallucinations, disorientation, dehydration, swollen feet, sleep deprivation, extreme tiredness, tunnel vision and mind-numbing tedium during races lasting up to week at a time. During a 520-mile race across the Himalayas by foot, mountain bike and rope he almost died. Why does he do it? His spur could be a childhood of extreme poverty or maybe it's his physique, more that of a weightlifter than an athlete, or the memory of being called 'fat boy'. 'I'm an average person,' he insists. 'What I've done is something just about anybody could do if they put their mind to it. Don't just want to do something; if you want to attain something, get off your butt and make it happen.' Think you're in shape? In 24 hours the world's fittest man completed 13 events: Cycling: 100 miles Run: 10 miles Powerwalk: five miles Kayak: six miles Hike: 10 miles Swim: two miles Abdominal crunches: 3,000 Jumping jacks: 1,100 Push-ups: 1,100 Leg-lifts: 1,000 Skiing machine: 10 miles Rowing machine: 10 miles Lift: 278,540lbs denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Alexander Mitchell had an admission to make. 'I confirmly confess that I was ordered to carry out an explosion here in Riyadh, which took place on Friday the 17th of November, the year 2000.'</p> <p>The Scotsman squinted at the television autocue before continuing his statement, which was riddled with grammatical errors: 'The explosion was directed against Mr Christopher Rodway, who is a British nationality. I placed the explosive device under the driver's seat of Christopher's car.'</p> <p>Minutes earlier, Mitchell had arrived under heavy armed guard at the studios of Saudi national television in downtown Riyadh with Canadian William Sampson and Belgian Raaf Schifte. They were about to admit killing Rodway and blowing up another car in which three more Britons and an Irish woman were injured.</p> <p>But to observers, something appeared odd. Looking dazed and frightened, the trio sat separately behind a desk and used a pointer stick to show how they carried out the attacks. Mitchell said he had been ordered to use a remote control to carry out the bombing, but would not say who gave the instructions or why.</p> <p>The 46-year-old also used street maps to show the location of the victim's houses and the exact sites of the blasts. He would have known that, under Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law, convicted murderers are beheaded, usually in public, to deter others.</p> <p>His friends were astonished. 'His words made no sense, especially saying he was commanded to carry out the attack. He was a jovial man about town, with fingers in a lot of pies but always good for a laugh,' said one. Another thought Mitchell looked drugged or was suffering from the effects of extreme fatigue.</p> <p>The authorities had hoped the arrests and confessions would lead to swift justice and put an end to speculation about the possibility that terrorists were active in this prosperous state. The authorities hoped that blaming infidels from the West would prove that the Saudis were a peaceful people.</p> <p>But the authorities were wrong. The country is buzzing with rumours about the decadent high life of the Western residents of 'Happy Valley', and dark mutterings about whether innocent men are to be put to death.</p> <p>It was a sunny day when the 4x4 car pulled up to a crossroads in the centre of Riyadh four months ago. Inside were Rodway, who worked in a hospital, and his wife, Jane. Seconds later an explosion tore through the vehicle, shattering the silence that usually hangs over the Saudi capital's streets on the Muslim holy day of prayer.</p> <p>A bomb had almost severed Rodway's leg. As frantic passers-by rushed to the scene and called the emergency services, it was clear his chances of survival were small. Later that evening Rodway died. Jane was lucky. She escaped with minor injuries.</p> <p>Five days later, on 22 November, a second car bomb went off. The targets this time were driving down Riyadh's old airport road. The blast injured all of them, with one, Mark Paine, requiring major surgery to save a leg.</p> <p>Panic spread rapidly through the expat community. Islamic terrorists were suspected as the attacks came soon after a suicide bombing that killed 17 US sailors in Yemen. Warnings were issued to check cars and a host of events on the usually busy expat social scene were hastily cancelled.</p> <p>When a third bomb exploded in the eastern city of Al Khobar, pressure on the Saudi police reached its peak. David Brown, a British Coca-Cola executive, lost an eye when a juice carton left on his car exploded in his face. Now terrified of having its international image damaged, the Saudis moved quickly. Mitchell and other Westerners were already known to the police for their past role in the illegal alcohol trade and were arrested on 17 December, along with six other foreigners, for drinks offences.</p> <p>But in pinning the crimes on Western suspects linked to the underground drinking industry, the Saudis lifted the lid on one of their best kept secrets - the decadent high life enjoyed by foreigners living there. Despite strict laws that include a ban on drink, drugs and women drivers - upheld by the Mutawwa'in religious police - it is possible to party around the clock in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Alcohol is freely available. Diplomats and their visitors used to rely on foreign embassies sneaking liquor into their compounds in diplomatic bags. But recently the scene has exploded into a fully-fledged industry, fuelled by smuggling over the long and porous desert border with Yemen.</p> <p>Other merchandise comes in from neighbouring Bahrain, where alchohol is legal. Most of it is brand-named and expensive: a bottle of malt whisky costs more than \u00a3125.</p> <p>There is also a thriving cottage industry in home-brewed beers, wines and spirits. Thousands of gallons are distilled inside the self-contained compounds in which most foreigners live and where makeshift bars are set up. Deliveries are usually made on a Friday, when most of the local population are at mosques praying.</p> <p>But the pubs are an open secret. They are bought and sold, have names such as Raffles and the Empire Club, regular discos and breweries in their backrooms. Mitchell once owned a bar called Celtic Corner, which had its own membership lists and a gymnasium. Last year he sold up to Rodway and Saudi police have seized on the transaction as a possible source of dispute between the two men.</p> <p>But it is not only Westerners who are living it up in the desert: the high life attracts the cream of Saudi society. Some are there for the drinks, others are there to make money. Saudi business relies heavily on patronage and, according to diplomatic sources, all the leading Western bootleggers have senior Saudi backers who take a slice of the illegal profits.</p> <p>'Saudi is not like it used to be. You can get anything you want there if you are willing to pay for it, and some of the people hanging around these bars are very senior people. It is big money,' said Barry Jones, who lived for several years in Riyadh and worked in publishing.</p> <p>The parties are often wild. Many of the expat workers, from nurses to oilmen, are single. With money to spend and severe restrictions on public shows of decadence, what goes on behind closed doors is often hedonistic. One former resident joked last week that few marriages survived an extended stay in the country.</p> <p>According to former residents, drugs too are becoming part of the expat lifestyle, though they are not tolerated by the authorities. Marijuana, cocaine and even heroin are available to those willing to pay. The penalty for those caught trying to smuggle in drugs, usually 'mules' from countries such as Nigeria and Pakistan, is death. With such a vibrant market for illicit goods, Saudi police claim it was no surprise that turf wars would erupt now and then. The apparent involvement of three Westerners in the alcohol trade and the sale of illegal bars seemed to confirm that shady dealings would lead to trouble.</p> <p>Despite the arrests of Mitchell, Sampson and Schifte, the bombings continued. An explosion rocked the plush Euromarche mall in Riyadh on 10 January. The blast injured no one but destroyed a telephone booth and damaged a passing car. And it was this explosion that could lead police to those behind the previous bombings, including the explosions admitted by the three Western suspects.</p> <p>Saudi dissidents, speaking to The Observer, revealed last week that a note claiming responsibility for the Euromarch\u00e9 bombing was left at the scene. The note, which did not identify a specific group, warned of more and bigger attacks to come unless the Saudi government released political prisoners.</p> <p>The opposition groups are Islamic fundamentalists, appalled that so many Westerners have been allowed into a country which guards the holiest shrines of Islam. They want them out and the Saudi royal family along with them. Yet the government relies on foreign expertise. Almost 300,000 Europeans and North Americans work in the country.</p> <p>If opposition groups are proved to have been behind the Euromarch\u00e9 bombing, some observers believe that linking them to the other bombings will be irresistible.</p> <p>'Most of the Islamic opposition people want to get foreigners out of the country. All these bombs have been targeted at foreigners,' said Said Aburish, a Middle East expert and author of a book on corruption in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Many of Saudi Arabia's small opposition groups take their inspiration from Osama bin Laden, who planned the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Ironically, the weapons and explosives used by these groups enter along the same routes used by alcohol smugglers - overland from Yemen.</p> <p>Raids by the police are common. The Observer has learnt that last November, after the first two bombings, more than 50 people linked to the opposition were arrested. 'The government knows it was jihadi (Islamic) groups behind all these four attacks. They just do not dare to admit it,' said Saad al-Faqih, head of the London-based Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, an opposition group campaigning for peaceful reform.</p> <p>Mindful of huge business interests in the country, Britain has played a careful diplomatic game, refusing to condemn outright the Saudi action in arresting Mitchell. But the trio face a long period of uncertainty while diplomats try to find a solution and avoid a trial that would almost certainly be held in secret. The men could escape death if Rodway's family accept 'blood money'. But Rodway's father, Jerry, has already called for his son's killers to be executed.</p> <p>Tory MP David Wilshire MP will this week table Commons questions to Foreign Secretary Robin Cook demanding stronger moves to protect Mitchell's rights. 'It would seem that the British Government is unwilling to kick up a fuss for fear of upsetting people who we do a lot of business with,' Wilshire said.</p> <p>Questions are also likely on why the men confessed. Human rights campaigners believe they were subjected to psychological torture. Locked up alone, denied food and threatened with abuse, a confession was inevitable, they claim. Eventually the men - exhausted, confused and terrified - were told to admit to the bombings.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the executioner's sword is being sharpened. Observers fear that could mean the truth may never be known.</p>",

The Scotsman squinted at the television autocue before continuing his statement, which was riddled with grammatical errors: 'The explosion was directed against Mr Christopher Rodway, who is a British nationality. I placed the explosive device under the driver's seat of Christopher's car.' Minutes earlier, Mitchell had arrived under heavy armed guard at the studios of Saudi national television in downtown Riyadh with Canadian William Sampson and Belgian Raaf Schifte. They were about to admit killing Rodway and blowing up another car in which three more Britons and an Irish woman were injured. But to observers, something appeared odd. Looking dazed and frightened, the trio sat separately behind a desk and used a pointer stick to show how they carried out the attacks. Mitchell said he had been ordered to use a remote control to carry out the bombing, but would not say who gave the instructions or why. The 46-year-old also used street maps to show the location of the victim's houses and the exact sites of the blasts. He would have known that, under Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law, convicted murderers are beheaded, usually in public, to deter others. His friends were astonished. 'His words made no sense, especially saying he was commanded to carry out the attack. He was a jovial man about town, with fingers in a lot of pies but always good for a laugh,' said one. Another thought Mitchell looked drugged or was suffering from the effects of extreme fatigue. The authorities had hoped the arrests and confessions would lead to swift justice and put an end to speculation about the possibility that terrorists were active in this prosperous state. The authorities hoped that blaming infidels from the West would prove that the Saudis were a peaceful people. But the authorities were wrong. The country is buzzing with rumours about the decadent high life of the Western residents of 'Happy Valley', and dark mutterings about whether innocent men are to be put to death. It was a sunny day when the 4x4 car pulled up to a crossroads in the centre of Riyadh four months ago. Inside were Rodway, who worked in a hospital, and his wife, Jane. Seconds later an explosion tore through the vehicle, shattering the silence that usually hangs over the Saudi capital's streets on the Muslim holy day of prayer. A bomb had almost severed Rodway's leg. As frantic passers-by rushed to the scene and called the emergency services, it was clear his chances of survival were small. Later that evening Rodway died. Jane was lucky. She escaped with minor injuries. Five days later, on 22 November, a second car bomb went off. The targets this time were driving down Riyadh's old airport road. The blast injured all of them, with one, Mark Paine, requiring major surgery to save a leg. Panic spread rapidly through the expat community. Islamic terrorists were suspected as the attacks came soon after a suicide bombing that killed 17 US sailors in Yemen. Warnings were issued to check cars and a host of events on the usually busy expat social scene were hastily cancelled. When a third bomb exploded in the eastern city of Al Khobar, pressure on the Saudi police reached its peak. David Brown, a British Coca-Cola executive, lost an eye when a juice carton left on his car exploded in his face. Now terrified of having its international image damaged, the Saudis moved quickly. Mitchell and other Westerners were already known to the police for their past role in the illegal alcohol trade and were arrested on 17 December, along with six other foreigners, for drinks offences. But in pinning the crimes on Western suspects linked to the underground drinking industry, the Saudis lifted the lid on one of their best kept secrets - the decadent high life enjoyed by foreigners living there. Despite strict laws that include a ban on drink, drugs and women drivers - upheld by the Mutawwa'in religious police - it is possible to party around the clock in Saudi Arabia. Alcohol is freely available. Diplomats and their visitors used to rely on foreign embassies sneaking liquor into their compounds in diplomatic bags. But recently the scene has exploded into a fully-fledged industry, fuelled by smuggling over the long and porous desert border with Yemen. Other merchandise comes in from neighbouring Bahrain, where alchohol is legal. Most of it is brand-named and expensive: a bottle of malt whisky costs more than \u00a3125. There is also a thriving cottage industry in home-brewed beers, wines and spirits. Thousands of gallons are distilled inside the self-contained compounds in which most foreigners live and where makeshift bars are set up. Deliveries are usually made on a Friday, when most of the local population are at mosques praying. But the pubs are an open secret. They are bought and sold, have names such as Raffles and the Empire Club, regular discos and breweries in their backrooms. Mitchell once owned a bar called Celtic Corner, which had its own membership lists and a gymnasium. Last year he sold up to Rodway and Saudi police have seized on the transaction as a possible source of dispute between the two men. But it is not only Westerners who are living it up in the desert: the high life attracts the cream of Saudi society. Some are there for the drinks, others are there to make money. Saudi business relies heavily on patronage and, according to diplomatic sources, all the leading Western bootleggers have senior Saudi backers who take a slice of the illegal profits. 'Saudi is not like it used to be. You can get anything you want there if you are willing to pay for it, and some of the people hanging around these bars are very senior people. It is big money,' said Barry Jones, who lived for several years in Riyadh and worked in publishing. The parties are often wild. Many of the expat workers, from nurses to oilmen, are single. With money to spend and severe restrictions on public shows of decadence, what goes on behind closed doors is often hedonistic. One former resident joked last week that few marriages survived an extended stay in the country. According to former residents, drugs too are becoming part of the expat lifestyle, though they are not tolerated by the authorities. Marijuana, cocaine and even heroin are available to those willing to pay. The penalty for those caught trying to smuggle in drugs, usually 'mules' from countries such as Nigeria and Pakistan, is death. With such a vibrant market for illicit goods, Saudi police claim it was no surprise that turf wars would erupt now and then. The apparent involvement of three Westerners in the alcohol trade and the sale of illegal bars seemed to confirm that shady dealings would lead to trouble. Despite the arrests of Mitchell, Sampson and Schifte, the bombings continued. An explosion rocked the plush Euromarche mall in Riyadh on 10 January. The blast injured no one but destroyed a telephone booth and damaged a passing car. And it was this explosion that could lead police to those behind the previous bombings, including the explosions admitted by the three Western suspects. Saudi dissidents, speaking to The Observer, revealed last week that a note claiming responsibility for the Euromarch\u00e9 bombing was left at the scene. The note, which did not identify a specific group, warned of more and bigger attacks to come unless the Saudi government released political prisoners. The opposition groups are Islamic fundamentalists, appalled that so many Westerners have been allowed into a country which guards the holiest shrines of Islam. They want them out and the Saudi royal family along with them. Yet the government relies on foreign expertise. Almost 300,000 Europeans and North Americans work in the country. If opposition groups are proved to have been behind the Euromarch\u00e9 bombing, some observers believe that linking them to the other bombings will be irresistible. 'Most of the Islamic opposition people want to get foreigners out of the country. All these bombs have been targeted at foreigners,' said Said Aburish, a Middle East expert and author of a book on corruption in Saudi Arabia. Many of Saudi Arabia's small opposition groups take their inspiration from Osama bin Laden, who planned the bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Ironically, the weapons and explosives used by these groups enter along the same routes used by alcohol smugglers - overland from Yemen. Raids by the police are common. The Observer has learnt that last November, after the first two bombings, more than 50 people linked to the opposition were arrested. 'The government knows it was jihadi (Islamic) groups behind all these four attacks. They just do not dare to admit it,' said Saad al-Faqih, head of the London-based Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, an opposition group campaigning for peaceful reform. Mindful of huge business interests in the country, Britain has played a careful diplomatic game, refusing to condemn outright the Saudi action in arresting Mitchell. But the trio face a long period of uncertainty while diplomats try to find a solution and avoid a trial that would almost certainly be held in secret. The men could escape death if Rodway's family accept 'blood money'. But Rodway's father, Jerry, has already called for his son's killers to be executed. Tory MP David Wilshire MP will this week table Commons questions to Foreign Secretary Robin Cook demanding stronger moves to protect Mitchell's rights. 'It would seem that the British Government is unwilling to kick up a fuss for fear of upsetting people who we do a lot of business with,' Wilshire said. Questions are also likely on why the men confessed. Human rights campaigners believe they were subjected to psychological torture. Locked up alone, denied food and threatened with abuse, a confession was inevitable, they claim. Eventually the men - exhausted, confused and terrified - were told to admit to the bombings. Meanwhile, the executioner's sword is being sharpened. Observers fear that could mean the truth may never be known.",

A Kevin Elyot play is a memory play. It tracks back from the present (the new one is prefaced by a Proust quotation) towards a transforming historical moment. The mood is elegiac and regretful. Liaisons are covert and complicated. The sexual charge is gay. </p> <p>All this is true of <strong> Mouth to Mouth</strong>. It begins with a taut, mysterious exchange between Lindsay Duncan (mute and fragile in dark glasses) and an uneasy Michael Maloney. It flashes back to scenes between Duncan and her teenage son: a delicious episode shows them resolving a quarrel as they tango together. It shows Maloney snogging this son - not for the first time. It discloses the son's early, perhaps suicidal death; it reveals that the boy's father was the man he thought was his uncle. It suggests that the Maloney character, a floundering writer, is going to salvage his career by using all this as material. </p> <p>Exquisitely directed by Ian Rickson - so that the whole drama seems to be performed in one breath - and flagged up as sensitive by mauve lighting, this is a beguiling evening, an evening that holds you. But it's as if the tragedy has been grafted on to a smaller, more niggling plot. Too many crucial moments don't make sense. Lindsay Duncan - who's terrific at being louche in a scarlet petticoat - is required to display grief by an exorbitant stammer. It's as if she's taking an Open University course on losing it. </p> <p>In a series of very funny cross-patch memoirs, Simon Gray has recorded how disagreeable it is struggling to get a play put on. You could deduce some of these troubles from his plays, which chronicle the lives of people - teachers of literature, editors of small magazines - who may, if Shakespeare is extruded from the syllabus, be on the point of extinction. But, from the buoyant literary allusions, and the packed dialogue, you also deduce something worth struggling for. Gray is the most intricately literary of contemporary dramatists. Sardonic, alert, crammed. </p> <p><strong> Japes</strong> - the misleadingly jaunty title refers to a nickname - is a case in point. Two brothers and one woman are followed over 27 years. One man's a lauded writer - first seen in his twenties being self-importantly blocked; later glimpsed haggard with triumph after a TV show. He (the insufficiently feline Jasper Britton) marries the girl. His younger brother, an unpublished drunk, sleeps with her (everyone knowing and not saying, and therefore getting by) throughout the courtship and marriage. Toby Stephens lights up this part with a virtuoso performance - by turn nonchalant and lolling, ramshackle and desperate; full of charm and full of fire. Clare Swinburne can't do the same with the female part. With a ruthless logic, her role is underwritten, to underline the fact that for the two brothers she barely exists as a character: they fancy her but are preoccupied with each other. </p> <p> Japes contains one scene and one character too many. The child of the wife and lover would have been more potent left to the imagination. And Gray is more inward with the defining detail of the Seventies and Eighties. John Gunter's ugly design - grey walls which look as if someone's dragged a chisel through wet cement - doesn't sharpen Peter Hall's production. But it doesn't disguise the subject of an uneven but astute play. Towards the end, a vigorous assault is launched on 'in yer face' theatre: you could see this as a continuation of Gray's grumbling memoirs, but it's also a repudiation of the idea that being explicit is the same as being precise. Gray, the fluent wordspinner, turns out to be an advocate of keeping it buttoned. </p> <p>Charlotte Jones's last play, In Flame, moved from the Bush to the West End. Her fourth will open at the National later this year. Meanwhile, <strong> Martha, Josie and the Chinese Elvis</strong> is at Watford. It features a middle-aged woman running a cosy household in Bolton - and working as a dominatrix. She has a simple 30-year-old daughter who fantasises about being an ice-skating champion; she employs a cleaner with an obsessive-compulsive disorder. Her doorbell plays 'Love me Tender'; her most regular client - a dry-cleaner who dresses up as an ultra-frilly-knickered French maid - makes a cocktail called 'A Catastrophe'. </p> <p>From the start, everything is light and loopy, and laced with camp innuendo: 'a nice girl is always in control of her gusset'. But the play takes off when the main act - Tim Wong, a nervous trainee Elvis impersonator - arrives. This isn't just because of the music, and the extravagant imitation of those splayed and shaking legs. Watching an act of impersonation in the theatre - where, after all, everyone on stage is pretending to be someone else - always has a receding-mirror thrill. In this case, it also slips neatly into a crossword puzzle-style pattern. Wong's Elvis isn't the only character to rise from the dead. And he's not the only focus of obsession. </p> <p>Lawrence Till's production has had them roaring at Watford. By the time it gets to the West End, a few bumps - a slowish start and some over-jolly acting, especially by Debra Penny who seems bent on doing a Sue Pollard impersonation - should be smoothed out. Some things don't need to be. Belinda Lang undergoes a lovely transformation from holy drudge to raven-haired temptress.

It could do most of all with redirection. Nicholas Georgiadis has abstracted his architectural set, leaving its stairs and arches intact throughout but making scene changes emblematic rather than realistic. The action is speeded up; the ballet's dramatic emphasis shifts; the dancers can no longer rely on the decor to do their acting for them. </p> <p>In the ballroom scene the massed might of the Capulets has now to be conveyed through imperious dancing instead of an intimidating set. The opening march is an amble, Tybalt a pussycat, Lord Capulet an old buffer in his dressing gown. At the first two performances, with Sylvie Guillem as Juliet and Nicolas Le Riche as Romeo, the lovers' tragedy took place in a vacuum. Le Riche's companions were so miscast that his Romeo had no context; Guillem's Juliet was so self-absorbed that her family scarcely impinged on her. </p> <p>Guillem's finely detailed acting is not carried through into her dancing. MacMillan's steps don't speak for her, conveying more than Juliet can possibly know. She never seems to entrust her full weight to her partner so that their bodies fuse: the pas de deux expressing their joint feelings become a series of lifts executed by two soloists. </p> <p>Le Riche, who dances Nureyev's version of the ballet for the Paris Opera, has not yet come to terms with MacMillan's account. He is lost in this production, a piercingly sincere performer bluffing his way without help. When he briefly finds the right phrasing for the choreography, he reveals what a Romeo he might be. The Royal Ballet's cast seems similarly rudderless, crying out for a guiding hand.</p>",

Guillem's finely detailed acting is not carried through into her dancing. MacMillan's steps don't speak for her, conveying more than Juliet can possibly know. She never seems to entrust her full weight to her partner so that their bodies fuse: the pas de deux expressing their joint feelings become a series of lifts executed by two soloists. Le Riche, who dances Nureyev's version of the ballet for the Paris Opera, has not yet come to terms with MacMillan's account. He is lost in this production, a piercingly sincere performer bluffing his way without help. When he briefly finds the right phrasing for the choreography, he reveals what a Romeo he might be. The Royal Ballet's cast seems similarly rudderless, crying out for a guiding hand.",

Their claims are justified. This lively programme, entitled Shorts and directed by Bill Bankes-Jones, opened a season of contemporary opera at Bridewell Theatre. </p> <p>Quirky though the subject matter of these operas may be, their intentions are serious. Production standards are high, the three singers (who share all the roles) are young, deft and able to act, and the works themselves offer contrasting musical and textual interest. Enigmatic interludes by Rachel Leach linked piece to piece. Each composer conjures sharply differing textures from only three instruments - clarinet, harp and cello - superbly played by Stuart King, Lucy Wakeford and Adrian Bradbury, and meticulously conducted by Orlando Jopling. </p> <p>The first work, Miss Treat by Des Oliver to a libretto by Meredith Oakes, was dexterous and funny. In a love triangle, the woman tries to keep two men in tow, only to lose both. Damian Thantrey (baritone) played the cheated lover, his petulance cleverly echoed by a testy clarinet line. Nicholas Sears (tenor), the challenger, had suave music to match his smooth-talking personality. Hilary Dolamore, a confidently skilled and versatile soprano, shrieked, whined and uttered incoherently as the hapless girl. Oliver's music cleverly mirrored the patterns of everyday speech with a rhythmic fluency few composers master. His setting of 'Wanker!' must class as the finest (if perhaps only) treatment of the word in all opera. </p> <p>From domestic drama to pocket-sized epic: in Julian Grant's Platform 10 or The Power of Literature, to a text by Christina Jones, two trainspotters, mournfully carolling the passing of the steam age, encounter Anna Karenina on the station platform. The collision of these kagoule-wearing monomaniacs with a fur-clad tragic beauty out of Russian literature had strange pathos. Grant devised urgent train music from screeching clarinet with insistent, percussive cello rhythms depicting a diddly-dom era now silenced by welded tracks. </p> <p>Gary Carpenter drew on patriotic songs, bugle calls and martial music for his bizarre collaboration with Simon Nicholson. Doggone told the true story of 7,000 dogs recruited by the British Army in the First World War for active service in the trenches. With absurdist ingenuity, these creatures were conveyed by pictures of the HMV gramophone dog staring out in military ranks from rows of metal music stands, which collapsed to surprise percussive effect at the end. Damian Thantrey's acting skills as dog-cum-sol dier were put to the test. He passed (on all fours) with flying colours and wagging tail. </p> <p>Elfyn Jones's elegiac The Nightjar, to words by Toby Slatterthwaite after a story by Ray Bradbury, conveyed the black grief and regrets of a middle-aged couple whose grown-up son has died. The Bach-like solo cello writing, offset by mellow harp and clarinet rhapsodies, had bleak power. In contrast, the last composition was the knottily farcical Seven Tons Of Dung, with a libretto by Bill Bankes-Jones and music by David Bruce. Hilary Dolamore gamely encased herself in green nylon to play Caterpillar, with whom Beetle is in love until she carelessly turns into a butterfly ('Oh bugger!

Together with his second quartet, 'Intimate Letters', these two ardent works were played by the virtuosic <b> Arditti Quartet</b> in an imaginative programme which interwove quartets (including two premieres) by Adrian Jack. </p> <p>The works were ideally paired. If Jan\u00e1cek's music is red-blooded with episodes of almost blanched intensity, Jack's are the reverse - shades of white with splashes of colour. His 'Third and Fourth Quartets' hold their emotion within. They have the hushed concentration of a conversation in progress, sotto voce , across a room, suddenly bursting out in sound before receding again. Silvery, sensuous melodies (achieved by using string harmonics) emerge from gently rocking accompaniments. The effect is at once transparent and alluringly elusive. </p> <p>Tolstoy, who featured in both these evenings, thought opera an exploitative waste of human resources.

Standing in the long queue for the most intimate gig U2 have staged since the days when John Peel played their records, in about 1863, I mentioned with an innocent chuckle that a tout had just offered me \u00a3400 for my ticket. The response I was looking for was amused derision, but suddenly the queue was awash with excited talk of what a person could buy with such a sum. Twenty rare U2 interview discs! A night on the town with Lady Victoria Hervey! 1,200 tea towels! </p> <p>Actually, no one specifically mentioned the interview discs, but for a moment, I had a vision of ending up inside the Astoria for this free, fan-only show, alone, save for hordes of Japanese and American fanatics who had been willing to fork out the 800 quid touts were demanding. That most people elected to hold the high ground and decline to sell is a tribute to both the band and our human capacity for extreme stupidity. </p> <p>Not that being a U2 fan is stupid. No one of sound mind and ear could feel comfortable with everything they've done: their success is down to the fact that, even when you hate them, you love them a little, too - often for the same reasons. Why? Because when they're at their soaring, chiming best, as they are during 'One' tonight, few other bands can touch them. Because a performance like this makes you realise that, like the squashed moth on your windscreen, they've travelled a huge distance over their 20 years, while also sort of staying in the same place. And because Bono is a media-watcher who hates being considered naff, but will grasp that nettle with selflessness and courage when he thinks that the situation demands it. And it so often does. Bless. </p> <p>All of which goes some way to explaining why the kids aren't here. U2 grew up with post-punk modernism, with the notion that rock must be pushed forward and periodically reinvented to be vital and interesting. But the generation who followed aren't remotely interested in this project, finding an impossible, alien romance in the trad stuff punk had aimed to supplant - hence Oasis, Travis, Coldplay, Stereophonics. Against our better instincts, some of us get grumpy about such reverence, but in the event this evening's show deftly illustrates - as if the Eighties hadn't done enough - both the thrills and pitfalls of the rock modernist agenda. </p> <p>Bono is looking more like Roy Orbison every day. A woman near me starts crying as he appears, beaming, in black leather jacket and shades. He wears the shades to hide the heroic collection of bags under his eyes, just as Edge dons his black skull cap to camouflage baldness. In fact, you know your audience is middle-aged when you remove your sunglasses and they gasp as if you'd just whipped off your G-string. But, dressed down in jeans and T-shirts, U2 look lean and sound sharp. 'We're back to reapply for the job,' the singer declaims - adding, before the Astoria janitors have time to get worried, that the job they seek is 'best band in the world'. All right, then. </p> <p>When the dust had settled, how preposterous did this seem, not six months after Radiohead had toured one of the most transporting shows ever seen? Not particularly, for the most part. It was pleasing to note that U2's appearance in such a modest venue felt extraordinary rather than Madonna-does-Academy surreal. At no point did you find yourself thinking 'What's that bunch of 40-year-old dads doing up there?' It was a strange set, though. The lights were spare as they began with impressive first showings of material from the open and engaging current album All That You Can't Leave Behind . The devotional 'Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of' was near perfect, Orbison meets Al Green, something quite different for U2. 'Beautiful Day' thundered excitably by and 'New York' was even better than on the record, swelling to one of the most stirring crescendos of the night (stirring crescendos being a U2 speciality). </p> <p>There were a few older pleasers, too. The single which got them noticed in the UK, 'I Will Follow', was fresh and pacy, while the aforementioned 'One' sent a shiver down your spine. Then, three quarters of the way through, the band's energy unexpectedly drained away, as they finished on a trio of nondescript tunes ('All I Want Is You' 'Bad' and 'Forty') I'd forgotten or didn't recognise, and which reminded me why I've often found these people so frustrating. </p> <p>Where had it gone? And why had they chosen to leave the likes of 'Gloria', 'Pride', 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and the peerless 'With Or Without You' hanging on the vine? Afterwards, some contended that the eccentric choice of material was admirable, others that it was a foolish indulgence. In the end, I found myself wondering, 'Could that performance have been worth \u00a3800?', to which a friend countered in exasperation, 'Andy, is anything worth \u00a3800?'. And the answer is that, yes, approximately 2,400 tea towels are.</p>",

The lights were spare as they began with impressive first showings of material from the open and engaging current album All That You Can't Leave Behind . The devotional 'Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of' was near perfect, Orbison meets Al Green, something quite different for U2. 'Beautiful Day' thundered excitably by and 'New York' was even better than on the record, swelling to one of the most stirring crescendos of the night (stirring crescendos being a U2 speciality). There were a few older pleasers, too. The single which got them noticed in the UK, 'I Will Follow', was fresh and pacy, while the aforementioned 'One' sent a shiver down your spine. Then, three quarters of the way through, the band's energy unexpectedly drained away, as they finished on a trio of nondescript tunes ('All I Want Is You' 'Bad' and 'Forty') I'd forgotten or didn't recognise, and which reminded me why I've often found these people so frustrating. Where had it gone? And why had they chosen to leave the likes of 'Gloria', 'Pride', 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and the peerless 'With Or Without You' hanging on the vine? Afterwards, some contended that the eccentric choice of material was admirable, others that it was a foolish indulgence. In the end, I found myself wondering, 'Could that performance have been worth \u00a3800?', to which a friend countered in exasperation, 'Andy, is anything worth \u00a3800?'. And the answer is that, yes, approximately 2,400 tea towels are.",

Anyone who disagrees should look again - namely at all those billboards, buses, T-shirts and ads that promoted the latest album from Blur. There they were, over and again, four faces reduced to simple black outlines: Damon, Graham, Alex and Dave as they might have been drawn by Herg\u00e9. These images came in every size, from CD to full-scale hoarding. Nor was there any idea of a limited edition, based on some priceless original. If you bought the album, it could even be argued that you now own a quartet of Opie portraits. </p> <p>I daresay most collectors would disagree, especially those prepared to pay \u00a312,000 for a large Damon, or \u00a318,000 for an outsize Alex. But that's the problem with a market that prizes the rare or unique - it can so easily be thwarted by an artist who doesn't hold back. Once Opie has fixed on his visual symbol, he will reproduce it in every conceivable format or size. A quick leaf through the catalogue he has produced for this show - based on those mail-order brochures for furniture or software - gives a comprehensive guide to the merchandise. You can buy animals, buildings and people as prints, wooden blocks or signposts. You can get landscapes on aluminium or video; portraits come in wallpaper or vinyl paint. </p> <p>Opie's blithe attitude to what he sells is both humorous and winningly frank. After all, he could hardly pretend to be producing complex masterpieces, each carefully nuanced by hand. At 44, Opie has run through a lot of different ideas, from visual gags to neon sculptures and quietly minimal paintings. But he developed the notion of modular art - units that came in build-your-own systems - even before his Hayward show in 1994, and he's stuck with it ever since. Most of the work at the Lisson Gallery is update and diversification: landscapes, portraits and nudes, genres of old master painting. </p> <p>The basic Opie unit is a representation of a representation. He takes a photograph, feeds it through a computer and then reduces it to a few quintessentials - for a portrait, it's the jawline, hairline, ears and neck, plus the features transcribed in his deadpan shorthand. This mainly consists of customised punctuation: angled commas, double hyphens and black full stops for eyes. Sometimes there are glasses; I specially like the way he indicates the rimless variety with a single ingenious contour. Occasionally there are highlights - rather sentimentally, in the eyes of children. The colour is bright and flat, the outlines have a zippy register and the final image is generally affectless, homogenised and irreducibly simple. </p> <p>Some find these pictures playful; others feel that they are infused with melancholy. If that seems an extreme response, bear in mind that there are people who become distressed by that sign for Elderly People Crossing the Road. Opie understands the power of signs - he's exploited it with his strategic signposts of shy animals, described in reflective paint, ready to be caught in the headlights of a darkened road. But his portraits are more likely to erase than evoke emotion. They tell you how little can really be learned from a snapshot: the human animal caught in a flash. </p> <p>Opie can take the riddles of representation too far, however, as with his stick-figure nudes. These are painted on building blocks - the head as a circle on a wooden cube, for example - and must have something to say about two versus three dimensions, though it's hard to tell quite what. But his ongoing series of roadscapes have got somewhere new by virtue of size. These generalised paintings, with their relentless white lines and views of mountains, trees and houses, used to be monotonously large. Now that they are tiny, like souvenirs, they instantly catch on your memory of other times and places. </p> <p>To say that Opie repeats himself would be no more than a trade description. It's the slight variations that make all the difference to this road movie - the sense that there is always further to go and more to see on the trip. One Opie on its own can look blank or cute or even wilfully simplistic. Together, in his bulk-buy modular system, they add up to a bigger view of the world as a language of limitless images. </p> <p>The South London Gallery has a video installation by <strong> Barbara Kruger</strong> , the veteran American moralist. You remember Kruger: 'I shop therefore I Am', 'Don't be a jerk!' and other accusatory or hortatory messages, generally printed on T-shirts or written up in neon, to the reported irritation of pedestrians in Times Square. </p> <p>Kruger never whispers if she can possibly shout. This time, she has hired a bunch of screaming heads to do the job on her behalf. A dozen actors, on three video screens, yell repeated sequences of abuse in deafening unison: 'You're not cool/ skinny/ pretty enough!', 'I hate you!', 'Who do you think you are?' This cycle of rejection is occasionally broken by swift reconciliations, illustrating, I guess, the awful proximity of love and hate. </p> <p>Kruger seems to be aiming for the brutal effects of Bruce Nauman, but the piece has none of his piercing directness - largely because her actors are so clearly reading from autocues. It's the same old problem with her work: exactly who is she addressing?

Short of bringing on Kurt Cobain for an encore, this show was never going to equal expectations. He arrived in Britain as the most famous and notorious pop star in the world. Love him for his verbal dexterity or loathe him for his apparent misogynist and homophobic tendencies - Eminem is not someone who provokes a neutral reaction - there is just no one bigger at the moment. </p> <p>Manchester was put on red alert as the rapper and his entourage - a cast of hundreds, we were told - descended on the north-west. Outside the venue before the gig there was no sign of the coming apocalypse as the predominately female teenage crowd huddled together in the chilly night. 'The only crimes I've seen today have involved peroxide abuse,' quipped a TV reporter to camera. </p> <p>There were also the protesters. Eminem's savagely comic rapping, which has understandably enraged gay and women's groups, lies at the heart of his appeal. Hip-hop lyrics aren't famed for their equal opportunities sentiments, and Eminem is hardly the first or most transgressive rapper to use denigrating epithets. But he is the biggest-selling one by some distance, and that, of course, is why he is under the microscope. </p> <p>It's hard to take his grotesque cartoon imagery seriously and, if you don't, he is funny - although the moment when his devilish alter-ego Slim Shady raps about sexually assaulting his mother on 'Kill You' provides an unsavoury test of faith (his mum didn't like it either: she's suing him for $10 million). What really makes Eminem so interesting is the relationship between his no-dad, white-trash record persona and the real thing. The implicit self-commentary and criticism on his recent No 1 'Stan' takes hip hop's solipsism into rare territory. </p> <p>Even before the extraordinary events of the past 12 months, Eminem had started making the instalments on the price of fame. His first album, The Slim Shady LP, was rude and witty. His second, The Marshall Mathers LP, is steeped in paranoia and anger about his distorted public image. One wonders what he's going to say on his third album. </p> <p>There were few clues to be found in his performance. It begins lamely with a jumpy, grainy Blair Witch- style video before the man himself appears onstage, resplendent in baggy dungarees, white hockey mask and chainsaw (which remained turned off due to venue restrictions). He stands in front of a mock-up of the dilapidated house that features on the cover of his latest album. The crowd roar with approval; however, it soon becomes apparent that, while lyrically, Eminem pushes the envelope, he can't repeat the trick onstage. After a truncated 'Kill You' and 'I'm Back', he brings on his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s D-12 for 20 minutes. It's a cheeky move that doesn't work. Eminem and mates lark about the stage as the crowd wait to hear the songs they've actually heard before. </p> <p>The mood picks up with 'Stan'. Dido is singing in London, so the 16,000-strong crowd provide a full-throated accompaniment. Eminem, inexplicably, cuts it short. Instead he inserts a series of adolescent skits into the show. In one, he sits on the front stoop and gets 'drunk' on Bacardi. In another, he pops an 'ecstasy pill'. He had earlier made sure the Manchester crowd were card-carrying substance abusers: 'I wanna know if I'm amongst some drug addicts [massive roar]. Good, then I feel right at home.' It's an ironic moment since most of the hooting crowd would struggle to get served at an off-licence. </p> <p>The show is big on such wheezes but soft on content. He stops for a 10-minute animated film, whose sole purpose it seems is to insult a Will Smith lookalike. The film's jokes are received in embarrassing silence. Everyone is pleased when he reappears on stage, strapped to an electric chair. The house has been replaced with a medieval castle, for no dis cernible reason, and the evening is in danger of descending into something more akin to pantomime than a performance by the most talked about man in music. </p> <p>Eminem clearly wants to have it both ways. He spends much of the night massaging his fans' visceral desire for safe violence and obscenity, but he can't resist a poke at the media for their two-dimensional reporting. Before the resounding 'The Way I Am', Eminem takes the opportunity to berate the media and other naysayers. 'I'm tired of people talking shit about me,' he announces. He struggles to make himself heard over the crowd who are delighted to find him in a chatty mood. He looks petulant as he tries to hush them. </p> <p>As Eminem spent much of last year on two huge US ensemble tours, Up in Smoke (hip hop) and Anger Management (rock), you would expect something better. At times he seems lazy.

      "body": "<p>Dance, our oldest form of self-expression, is always returning to its fabled primitive origins. Stravinsky in The Rite of Spring located its source in the savage celebration of the vernal equinox by Russian tribes: Michael Flatley in Riverdance derived it from the moist, boggy subsoil of Celtic folklore. Dance needs a mythology to explain it, to account for the frenzy which overtakes the lumpen, earthbound human body. Perhaps a god has come to visit the dancer, dispensing his or her legs from their customary obedience to gravity. </p> <p>The origins imagined by both Stravinsky and Flatley are romantically remote. But what accounts for the persistence of dance in our urbanised, industrial world? Another myth has grown up, which shows dance to be the sublimation of work. A few years ago at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, the dancers in Stomp rampaged through an industrial scraphead, salvaging junked kitchen sinks as percussion instruments; currently at the Old Vic, Matthew Bourne's greasy mechanic in The Car Man transforms the routines of automobile repair into strutting flamenco. But the most cleverly persuasive contemporary myth about the reinvention of dance is to be found in Tap Dogs, the Australian show which, first seen here in 1995, returns to Sadler's Wells next week. </p> <p>The dogs themselves are a gang of would-be building workers, clowning around and showing off on site. Rather than tights, they wear distressed jeans and rumpled T-shirts. Instead of effem inate ballet slippers, they're shod in elastic-sided heavy-duty boots, with metal plates positioned around the soles so their steps belligerently hammer the floor. In their back pockets, they carry screwdrivers, used to adjust or reinforce those deafening cleats. While dancing, they deploy blow-torches and metal-cutters, triumphantly transforming work into play. </p> <p>Since that first tour in 1995, Tap Dogs has become an institution, and something of a franchise operation. A year ago there were eight contingents of dogs on the road, indefatigably tapping in different parts of the globe. They were rounded up for the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games last year, when 700 of them took over the stadium. Kicking and stamping their way skywards on a metal gantry, they embodied Australia, with its combination of proletarian grit and sensual exuberance. The dogs are also available for celebrations more mercenary and less cosmically joyous than the Olympic finale. They have appeared at industrial binges in honour of BMW, Toyota, Audi and Mercedes Benz: there's no car in their show, but their bodies, after all, are the sleekest and most revved-up of vehicles. </p> <p>As one of the current dogs, Douglas Mills, bragged at rehearsals last week: 'It's got bigger and bigger, and it's gone everywhere.' So how does the show's creator and choreographer, Dein Perry, manage to oversee his burgeoning litters of pups? His representative in the London cast is Jim Doubtfire, a grizzled tapper of nearly 30 who calculates he has a couple more seasons as a canine left in him: 'Dein's back in Australia, but we send him videos. That way he knows whether the lads are doing it proper'. </p> <p>Perry, in between vetting those tapes, keeps himself busy mythologising his own creation. Tap Dogs now has its own corporate legend, a tall tale combining inspiration with perspiration. Perry, a working-class boy in the grim steel town of Newcastle north of Sydney, taught himself to tap on the sly in a backyard garage. Convinced he had no chance of a stage career, he settled for union membership and a steady job as a machinist. But a government grant encouraged him to try out a show which he first called Tap Brothers. </p> <p>Thus saith the myth; the rest, after that initial Sydney season in 1995, is more reliably documented history. If it all sounds familiar, that's because it's mythical. Baz Luhrman dreamed up a similarly heroic story about the aspirations of a different kind of dancer in his film Strictly Ballroom, also set in Sydney; the north of England now has its own version of Dein's parable in Stephen Daldry's Billy Elliot - and, to solemnise this merger of myths, Jamie Bell, who plays Billy in the film, will be a guest at the press night of Tap Dogs on Tuesday. </p> <p>Perry has recently dealt with the genesis of the show in his own film, Boot Men. His pitch for it cunningly welds his own private saga on to another one of Australia's newly invented epics of ancient times. 'It's sort of Mad Max meets a tap dancer,' he says, leaving the rest to your imagination. </p> <p>When confronting a myth, you need to prepare yourself for the discovery of fiction, or outright fraud. Mythology, as Roland Barthes understood, is merely an adroit and infectious way of telling lies - in this case, a convenient means of fusing the grind of heavy industry with the feckless freedom of dance. At least in The Full Monty the steelworkers waited until they were unemployed before they began bumping and grinding; in Tap Dogs, they perform while still on the job. Still, despite my scepticism, I was looking forward to meeting some of my compatriots when I went to watch the dogs record a television programme at a studio in Acton. But from a distance, they already looked odd - scrawny and unsunned, more like refugees from the orphanage in Oliver! than the beach bums I was expecting. And when they opened their mouths (which should have been a giveaway, since Australians, when talking, try not to do so), I heard the dropped aitches and swallowed consonants of British slang: all but two of the company came from the Home Counties. </p> <p>Doug, whom I quoted above, lives with his mum in Tunbridge Wells; Martyn Herbert - that Olde English spelling of his first name would be laughed to scorn in Australia - trained in East Grinstead; and one of their colleagues even has the forelock-tuggingly feudal name of Nicholas Yeoman. No wonder that, when Tap Dogs visited Copenhagen last year, a newspaper described them as 'curs without pure-bred pedigree'. Mongrels, I thought (which in Australia, I should explain, is a term of more or less affectionate abuse). </p> <p>Being British, the current dogs are unhealthy with a vengeance. 'Very high fag intake,' sniffed the woman who had to interview them after their television performance. The show's backstage lore tells of steel buckets positioned in the wings so that the boys - if they've eaten too soon before the more acrobatic episodes - can throw up and then gallantly carry on dancing; all I saw was the furtive exchange of cigarette packets before they whirled on for their solos. The tour manager told me they had a week of circuit training ahead of them, to tone up for the opening. But they were busily negotiating 'ciggie breaks' at regular intervals in their work-outs. </p> <p>More endearingly, their Britishness means the possibility of failure has to be ironically incorporated into a show which is supposedly about impeccable physical skills. One of the segments I watched began with Jim twirling a basketball and bouncing it between his stocky legs. 'If I drop this, don't laugh,' he said to the others. 'If I faint,' he added, after a spasm of smoker's coughing, 'just keep on going.' </p> <p>The show's myth, like the Australian creed of mateship which it draws on, finesses another potentially embarrassing contradiction. The tap routines are courting dances, performed by an all-male cast whose jeans, boots and flannel shirts imitate a strictly encoded, now rather old-fashioned gay look. One of the Village People, back in the 1970s, was a construction worker. </p> <p> Tap Dogs even risks a urinal scene, with much innocent splashing of pee. But the decorum of the show is resolutely homosocial, never homoerotic. Chris Ernest, a recent recruit, insisted: 'We're just good friends.' </p> <p>But in between television takes, the upright manly postures of the troupe began to bend, as Jim, answerable to the absent Dein Perry, fetishistically fussed over Chris's costume: 'Put your T-shirt down. And loop your flannel shirt round your waist. It should be like a cowboy belt.' 'It feels more like a bra,' winced Chris, tying the shirt sleeves at his waist. 'Love your tail,' commented Doug. Jim made sure the garments formed exactly the same pattern as they'd done on hundreds of other previous dogs on four continents: 'Here, Mum'll do it for you. There you go, son.' </p> <p>Of course the spontaneous emergence of Tap Dogs on the factory floor in Newcastle is another myth not to be trusted.

      "bodyText": "Dance, our oldest form of self-expression, is always returning to its fabled primitive origins. Stravinsky in The Rite of Spring located its source in the savage celebration of the vernal equinox by Russian tribes: Michael Flatley in Riverdance derived it from the moist, boggy subsoil of Celtic folklore. Dance needs a mythology to explain it, to account for the frenzy which overtakes the lumpen, earthbound human body. Perhaps a god has come to visit the dancer, dispensing his or her legs from their customary obedience to gravity. The origins imagined by both Stravinsky and Flatley are romantically remote. But what accounts for the persistence of dance in our urbanised, industrial world? Another myth has grown up, which shows dance to be the sublimation of work. A few years ago at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, the dancers in Stomp rampaged through an industrial scraphead, salvaging junked kitchen sinks as percussion instruments; currently at the Old Vic, Matthew Bourne's greasy mechanic in The Car Man transforms the routines of automobile repair into strutting flamenco. But the most cleverly persuasive contemporary myth about the reinvention of dance is to be found in Tap Dogs, the Australian show which, first seen here in 1995, returns to Sadler's Wells next week. The dogs themselves are a gang of would-be building workers, clowning around and showing off on site. Rather than tights, they wear distressed jeans and rumpled T-shirts. Instead of effem inate ballet slippers, they're shod in elastic-sided heavy-duty boots, with metal plates positioned around the soles so their steps belligerently hammer the floor. In their back pockets, they carry screwdrivers, used to adjust or reinforce those deafening cleats. While dancing, they deploy blow-torches and metal-cutters, triumphantly transforming work into play. Since that first tour in 1995, Tap Dogs has become an institution, and something of a franchise operation. A year ago there were eight contingents of dogs on the road, indefatigably tapping in different parts of the globe. They were rounded up for the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games last year, when 700 of them took over the stadium. Kicking and stamping their way skywards on a metal gantry, they embodied Australia, with its combination of proletarian grit and sensual exuberance. The dogs are also available for celebrations more mercenary and less cosmically joyous than the Olympic finale. They have appeared at industrial binges in honour of BMW, Toyota, Audi and Mercedes Benz: there's no car in their show, but their bodies, after all, are the sleekest and most revved-up of vehicles.

This has led to encounters with prostitutes who seem to regard it as 'normal' but these encounters leave a deep sense of guilt. I would value your opinion on whether I should discuss this with my wife.<br>C.A. of Telford</p> <p>The horns of your dilemma present different points of view to me as a would-be adviser. They are, first, to engage with you by getting inside an obsession I don't share and, second, to understand why, after 30 years of suffering in silence, you want to spill the beans now.</p> <p>Fetishism is still regarded as a deviation, but only by those who are not themselves in thrall. Secrecy in sexual matters is all-pervading and is an ideal growth medium for misinformation. Masturbation used to be similarly seen as abnormal, harmful behaviour. Fetishism is so common that it could be seen as normal, as your ladies of the night confirm. It is neither sinful nor harmful unless a combination of addiction, shame and guilt lead you into risk-taking behaviour - which does unfortunately seem to have happened.</p> <p>Rubber is not all that illogical as a sexual stimulant, seeing that it has a texture very like skin. Similarly a penchant for fur is a reminder of a hairy-coated past. Fixation with these totems tends to be exclusively male, so there is the usual gender comprehension gap.</p> <p>Your wife might have accepted the rubber if introduced to it early in the relationship. She might even do so now, but you can hardly expect her to hear tales of the demi-monde with equanimity. With them you have doubly betrayed her, by indicating her inadequacy to meet your needs, and by exposing her to damaging sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>I fear your wish to discuss the guilt feelings with your wife may be a mark of extreme selfishness, rather than a wish to put things right. If you believe such a course will give you relief then you are seriously deluded.</p> <p>Try to understand your wife's perspective, oblivious as she is that her staid and respectable spouse is actually a frequenter of bordellos and, worse, a client with colourful, specialised tastes. Her entire being will come crashing down about her ears; your marriage and probably your reputation too will be the first casualties.</p> <p>You are not the person she sees from first awakening to goodnight kiss. You have the choice of destroying both your lives, or allowing her to live in deluded peace, while struggling with your demons alone.</p> <p>It is not a happy choice, I agree. But the guilt attaches to the infidelity with real live people rather than inanimate objects, and maybe for the future that is something which lies within your control.</p> <p><b>Readers' replies</b></p> <p>Quite frankly I am amazed at what you are suggesting! I have always been attracted to shiny materials such as rubber and have told my partner this. She knows that I like to dress in it and I adore seeing her dressed in it too. It's something we sometimes share and it helps to spice life up a bit!</p> <p>But to keep this hidden for 30 years. I'm wondering if it's the attraction of other women dressed in rubber that appeals and excites you. Your wife will be devastated if you tell her what's been going on.</p> <p>Tell her about your need and bring it into your own sex life if you can. If you talk to her about your needs she may even tell you about hers and what turns her on! It's the love and cuddles after the dressing up that makes life worthwhile. <br> Anon</p> <p><b> Next week's problem</b></p> <p>My husband and I recently moved house and I cleared out my son's bedroom (he is 24 and has left home).</p> <p>I discovered a bundle of notebooks he had kept when he was a teenager.

      "bodyText": "i have kept a secret from my wife for 30 years of married life: I find rubber fetish exciting. This has led to encounters with prostitutes who seem to regard it as 'normal' but these encounters leave a deep sense of guilt. I would value your opinion on whether I should discuss this with my wife. C.A. of Telford The horns of your dilemma present different points of view to me as a would-be adviser. They are, first, to engage with you by getting inside an obsession I don't share and, second, to understand why, after 30 years of suffering in silence, you want to spill the beans now. Fetishism is still regarded as a deviation, but only by those who are not themselves in thrall. Secrecy in sexual matters is all-pervading and is an ideal growth medium for misinformation. Masturbation used to be similarly seen as abnormal, harmful behaviour. Fetishism is so common that it could be seen as normal, as your ladies of the night confirm. It is neither sinful nor harmful unless a combination of addiction, shame and guilt lead you into risk-taking behaviour - which does unfortunately seem to have happened. Rubber is not all that illogical as a sexual stimulant, seeing that it has a texture very like skin. Similarly a penchant for fur is a reminder of a hairy-coated past. Fixation with these totems tends to be exclusively male, so there is the usual gender comprehension gap. Your wife might have accepted the rubber if introduced to it early in the relationship. She might even do so now, but you can hardly expect her to hear tales of the demi-monde with equanimity. With them you have doubly betrayed her, by indicating her inadequacy to meet your needs, and by exposing her to damaging sexually transmitted disease. I fear your wish to discuss the guilt feelings with your wife may be a mark of extreme selfishness, rather than a wish to put things right. If you believe such a course will give you relief then you are seriously deluded. Try to understand your wife's perspective, oblivious as she is that her staid and respectable spouse is actually a frequenter of bordellos and, worse, a client with colourful, specialised tastes. Her entire being will come crashing down about her ears; your marriage and probably your reputation too will be the first casualties. You are not the person she sees from first awakening to goodnight kiss. You have the choice of destroying both your lives, or allowing her to live in deluded peace, while struggling with your demons alone. It is not a happy choice, I agree. But the guilt attaches to the infidelity with real live people rather than inanimate objects, and maybe for the future that is something which lies within your control. Readers' replies Quite frankly I am amazed at what you are suggesting! I have always been attracted to shiny materials such as rubber and have told my partner this. She knows that I like to dress in it and I adore seeing her dressed in it too. It's something we sometimes share and it helps to spice life up a bit! But to keep this hidden for 30 years. I'm wondering if it's the attraction of other women dressed in rubber that appeals and excites you. Your wife will be devastated if you tell her what's been going on. Tell her about your need and bring it into your own sex life if you can. If you talk to her about your needs she may even tell you about hers and what turns her on! It's the love and cuddles after the dressing up that makes life worthwhile. Anon Next week's problem My husband and I recently moved house and I cleared out my son's bedroom (he is 24 and has left home). I discovered a bundle of notebooks he had kept when he was a teenager. The life I discovered bore little resemblance to the life I thought he led. It emerges he was sexually promiscuous and indulged in under-age sex with a girl of 12 when he was 16. I blame myself for reading the diary and want to confront him. What do I do?

For Chris and Nozomi, the first question was whose country to go to. Britain was Chris's obvious choice as he was in Japan for only a year on an Oxford University programme. 'I wanted to go somewhere new, anyway,' says Nozomi, who had never visited this country. 'On 23 December 1999, we came to Britain. I left everything in Japan.

      "body": "<p>Four years ago, Imperial Chemical Industries paid $8 billion (\u00a36bn) for a bundle of flavourings, fragrances and other speciality chemicals businesses from Unilever, marking the start of a restructuring programme at both businesses. </p> <p>The most dramatic restructuring has been at ICI. In the year before the Unilever deal, sales described as speciality - mainly paints at that time - accounted for just a third of the \u00a37.5bn total and half of the \u00a3350 million trading profit. Last year, international businesses - as speciality chemicals are now called - accounted for \u00a35.6bn of the \u00a37.8bn sales from ongoing businesses and virtually all the \u00a3612m trading profit. In the intervening period, it has ditched practically everything we associated with ICI, from the ethylene cracker at Teesside to its polyester business. </p> <p>Outwardly, the restructuring at Unilever has been rather less dramatic (although the 5,300 people who lost their jobs in the last year may not think so). There have been some disposals - Elizabeth Arden cosmetics is the most recent. And it is paring back its brand portfolio - 600 of its 1,670 products have gone so far, including British names such as Radion and Blue Band. Another 250 are targeted for 'delisting' by the end of next year and the aim is to focus on just 400 so-called 'power brands'. </p> <p>There have also been acquisitions - most notably the Knorr and Hellmans group Bestfoods, and Ben &amp; Jerry ice cream last year. But Unilever still makes the Persil, Stork and Bird's Eye fish fingers which made it famous. And the split of the business between detergents, personal care and food has not changed dramatically. </p> <p>The impact on the two share prices has been just as profound, but not in quite the way you would expect. ICI, despite the dramatic transformation, has seen its shares tumble to less than two-thirds of where they were when the Unilever purchase was announced. Unilever, by contrast, has all but doubled. </p> <p>Last week's results from the two companies give some clues as to why. </p> <p>First, ICI. On the face of it, its performance was decent enough: sales from its continuing operations rose by 3.8 per cent while operating profits jumped by 15 per cent. Look behind the figures, however, and the City found plenty to disappoint. National Starch, which now accounts for more than a third of the business, suffered a 1 per cent fall in profits for the year - and, more worrying, a 20 per cent fall in the last quarter. </p> <p>Brendan O'Neill, ICI's ebullient chief executive, shrugs off the decline. He says fears over the millennium bug made fourth quarter of 1999 particularly buoyant; the US slowdown is affecting demand but should be over relatively quickly; and the restructured company is far more resilient than old ICI would have been when oil prices trebled, as they did last year. </p> <p>He pointed to the performance of other divisions - the Quest flavourings and fragrance business was up 10 per cent and paints 12 per cent - as proof that ICI really had been transformed. In old ICI, all the businesses suffered together. But ICI's transformation was intended to make it resistant, if not immune, to economic cycles. </p> <p>If National Starch's profits can be hit so much by a mere dip in US demand, what will happen if there is a slump. Investors looked back at all the other ICI restructurings which tried, but failed, to shift it up the value chain and wonder if recession-proofing for ICI is like the gold at the end of the rainbow - never quite reached. </p> <p>As worrying is the balance sheet. O'Neill points to the dramatic improvement in interest cover - trading profits are now more than three times the interest bill - as evidence that its borrowings are under control. Others point out that its debt is still a massive \u00a32.8bn, pretty much where it started the year. And it is difficult to see it falling much more - the small amount that remains to be received from disposals will be eaten up by the \u00a3500m which has still to be spent on restructuring. </p> <p>Its longer-term targets are not that different from Unilever's. It aims to increase sales by between 4 and 5 per cent from organic growth, with another 1 to 2 per cent from acquisitions. The performance of National Starch, together with the fact that its debt levels make acquisitions difficult, has made the City doubt it can do that. </p> <p>Investors are willing to give Unilever the benefit of the doubt despite the fact that its sales, excluding acquisitions and disposals, rose by just 1.9 per cent - well below its target of 5.8 per cent. Margins, too, may have jumped to a record 12.1 per cent but that is still some way below the target of 16 to 17 per cent. And, following the Bestfoods deal, its borrowings are \u20ac26.5 billion (\u00a316.9 bn). </p> <p>But Unilever chief Niall FitzGerald can point to real progress on his Path to Growth programme. Sales of the leading brands, which will be the focus of attention, grew by 3.9 per cent over the year. These accelerated to 4.9 per cent in the third quarter, and now account for almost 80 per cent of sales. Margins increased by a full 1.7 per cent, even excluding Bestfoods. Add in the benefits from bedding down that deal, and the targets for 2004 look a little more realistic. </p> <p>It is being much more innovative - FitzGerald actually donned an apron to demonstrate its new range of Enjoy frozen foods; and its snack size Magnums have proved appealing. He says the concentration on a smaller number of brands does focus executives' minds. Dove, for example, one of its more established brands, grew by 20 per cent last year as it was extended from everything to skin and haircare. He is promising an extra \u20ac1.5bn of sales from such initiatives this year. </p> <p>Investors were disappointed by Unilever's performance, and the shares fell back slightly on the day. But after a recent strong run they stand on roughly 18 times expected earnings. </p> <p>ICI shares, also strong this year, were likewise hit by disappointment over the figures. Based on expectations of flat profits this year, they stand on around 11 times forecasts for 2001. It has already warned that it will halve the dividend this year, putting the yield at 3.3 per cent compared with Unilever's 2.5 per cent. That does not look expensive, but the shares are unlikely to recover much until it is clear National Starch can get back to growth. </p> <p>Unilever's rating is more demanding but its prospects are more exciting than ICI's - one analyst says its shares could be worth 1,000p if it can achieve its targets. FitzGerald has proved he has the energy to transform Unilever: the shares are worth buying.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, Imperial Chemical Industries paid $8 billion (\u00a36bn) for a bundle of flavourings, fragrances and other speciality chemicals businesses from Unilever, marking the start of a restructuring programme at both businesses. The most dramatic restructuring has been at ICI. In the year before the Unilever deal, sales described as speciality - mainly paints at that time - accounted for just a third of the \u00a37.5bn total and half of the \u00a3350 million trading profit. Last year, international businesses - as speciality chemicals are now called - accounted for \u00a35.6bn of the \u00a37.8bn sales from ongoing businesses and virtually all the \u00a3612m trading profit. In the intervening period, it has ditched practically everything we associated with ICI, from the ethylene cracker at Teesside to its polyester business. Outwardly, the restructuring at Unilever has been rather less dramatic (although the 5,300 people who lost their jobs in the last year may not think so). There have been some disposals - Elizabeth Arden cosmetics is the most recent. And it is paring back its brand portfolio - 600 of its 1,670 products have gone so far, including British names such as Radion and Blue Band. Another 250 are targeted for 'delisting' by the end of next year and the aim is to focus on just 400 so-called 'power brands'. There have also been acquisitions - most notably the Knorr and Hellmans group Bestfoods, and Ben &amp; Jerry ice cream last year. But Unilever still makes the Persil, Stork and Bird's Eye fish fingers which made it famous. And the split of the business between detergents, personal care and food has not changed dramatically. The impact on the two share prices has been just as profound, but not in quite the way you would expect. ICI, despite the dramatic transformation, has seen its shares tumble to less than two-thirds of where they were when the Unilever purchase was announced. Unilever, by contrast, has all but doubled. Last week's results from the two companies give some clues as to why. First, ICI. On the face of it, its performance was decent enough: sales from its continuing operations rose by 3.8 per cent while operating profits jumped by 15 per cent. Look behind the figures, however, and the City found plenty to disappoint. National Starch, which now accounts for more than a third of the business, suffered a 1 per cent fall in profits for the year - and, more worrying, a 20 per cent fall in the last quarter. Brendan O'Neill, ICI's ebullient chief executive, shrugs off the decline. He says fears over the millennium bug made fourth quarter of 1999 particularly buoyant; the US slowdown is affecting demand but should be over relatively quickly; and the restructured company is far more resilient than old ICI would have been when oil prices trebled, as they did last year. He pointed to the performance of other divisions - the Quest flavourings and fragrance business was up 10 per cent and paints 12 per cent - as proof that ICI really had been transformed. In old ICI, all the businesses suffered together. But ICI's transformation was intended to make it resistant, if not immune, to economic cycles. If National Starch's profits can be hit so much by a mere dip in US demand, what will happen if there is a slump. Investors looked back at all the other ICI restructurings which tried, but failed, to shift it up the value chain and wonder if recession-proofing for ICI is like the gold at the end of the rainbow - never quite reached. As worrying is the balance sheet. O'Neill points to the dramatic improvement in interest cover - trading profits are now more than three times the interest bill - as evidence that its borrowings are under control. Others point out that its debt is still a massive \u00a32.8bn, pretty much where it started the year. And it is difficult to see it falling much more - the small amount that remains to be received from disposals will be eaten up by the \u00a3500m which has still to be spent on restructuring. Its longer-term targets are not that different from Unilever's. It aims to increase sales by between 4 and 5 per cent from organic growth, with another 1 to 2 per cent from acquisitions. The performance of National Starch, together with the fact that its debt levels make acquisitions difficult, has made the City doubt it can do that. Investors are willing to give Unilever the benefit of the doubt despite the fact that its sales, excluding acquisitions and disposals, rose by just 1.9 per cent - well below its target of 5.8 per cent. Margins, too, may have jumped to a record 12.1 per cent but that is still some way below the target of 16 to 17 per cent. And, following the Bestfoods deal, its borrowings are \u20ac26.5 billion (\u00a316.9 bn). But Unilever chief Niall FitzGerald can point to real progress on his Path to Growth programme. Sales of the leading brands, which will be the focus of attention, grew by 3.9 per cent over the year. These accelerated to 4.9 per cent in the third quarter, and now account for almost 80 per cent of sales. Margins increased by a full 1.7 per cent, even excluding Bestfoods. Add in the benefits from bedding down that deal, and the targets for 2004 look a little more realistic. It is being much more innovative - FitzGerald actually donned an apron to demonstrate its new range of Enjoy frozen foods; and its snack size Magnums have proved appealing. He says the concentration on a smaller number of brands does focus executives' minds. Dove, for example, one of its more established brands, grew by 20 per cent last year as it was extended from everything to skin and haircare. He is promising an extra \u20ac1.5bn of sales from such initiatives this year. Investors were disappointed by Unilever's performance, and the shares fell back slightly on the day. But after a recent strong run they stand on roughly 18 times expected earnings. ICI shares, also strong this year, were likewise hit by disappointment over the figures. Based on expectations of flat profits this year, they stand on around 11 times forecasts for 2001. It has already warned that it will halve the dividend this year, putting the yield at 3.3 per cent compared with Unilever's 2.5 per cent. That does not look expensive, but the shares are unlikely to recover much until it is clear National Starch can get back to growth. Unilever's rating is more demanding but its prospects are more exciting than ICI's - one analyst says its shares could be worth 1,000p if it can achieve its targets. FitzGerald has proved he has the energy to transform Unilever: the shares are worth buying.",

Not the fox this time, but the badger. He asserts that badgers are a greater risk to human health than dogs and pigeons. Yet there is not a single recorded case in the UK of a badger transmitting anything more deadly than a flea to humans, and the only attacks have been against the likes of baiters who torment them or upon those involved in their conservation.

Meade is no hagiographer, but Allen is no saint, despite his perfect jokes, and her account suits him well. She holds nothing back: the analysis of Satchel, aged two and a half; Allen's hair transplants; his fascination with girls, and his 'tepid little affair' with Soon-Yi. Meade's unruly biography takes every imaginable detail, from sandwich fillings to childhood crises, and packs them into a clotted, Day-Glo, all-American rush that leaves her reader sullied, exhausted, and dazed with Schadenfreude. </p> <p>Fans of Allen will be distressed; his detractors' suspicions will be confirmed.

Now she has turned her attentions to Murasaki, the Japanese woman whose eleventh-century Tale of Genji foreshadowed, and overshadowed, the slow evolution of the novel. From Murasaki's own diaries, poetry and the Tale itself, Dalby has recreated an astonishingly elaborate and beautiful society, fraught with court intrigue and the dictates of elegance, where verses between friends shimmer with multiple meanings, and fans, robes and hairstyles are as eloquent as poetry. </p> <p>At this distance, fears and passions are speculative. Despite Dalby's excavation of her subject's every unassuming word, Murasaki's youthful romances and adult disappointments remain shadowy: it is her poetry, and Genji himself, which live. </p> <p>The externals of her life, however, are vivid enough to compensate. As an open door to a scented, silken world, and to the experiences of an extraordinary woman, The Tale of Murasaki has hypnotic power. </p> <p> <strong> Under the Skin</strong><br>Michael Faber<br>Canongate \u00a36.99, pp296<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000460221,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>Michael Faber's charming chiller of a debut is a weird and lovely hybrid - one of the sweetest nastiest novels you'll ever read. Half hitcher-horror set in the Scottish Highlands, half a ghoulishly beautiful story of humanity, inhumanity and moral ambivalence, Under the Skin examines the beguiling squalor of which, surely, only human beings are capable, and then turns that assumption squarely on its head. </p> <p>Isserley, its reluctant anti-heroine, is equally split. Surgically altered, gorgeous and deformed, she cruises country roads in search of muscled solitary men; not for sex - she's in no shape for that - but to serve other grislier purposes whose shocking revelation has the horrible sheen of truth. From a nacreous winter dawn to the baldest bodily specifics, Faber is an intelligent and wildly original writer and the result is revolting, sad and worryingly enjoyable all at once. </p> <p><strong> Cornucopia</strong><br>Paul Richardson<br>Abacus \u00a37.99, pp342<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501017161,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a></p> <p>As gentle and odd as the land it celebrates, this gastronomic tour of Britain is like the renegade grandson of Jane Grigson and Bill Bryson.

Cornucopia is Sunday-supplement food writing made flesh: hedonistic, leisurely fodder for foodies. </p> <p>Moreover, the food Richardson temptingly describes - the wild mushrooms and farm cheeses, the hop shoots, saffron cakes and legs of happy organic lamb - and the power of his case for old, real, good natural food, easily compensate for moments of self-indulgence and an odd emphasis on 'hearty, masculine' ingredients (as opposed to food for 'homosexual waiters' 'ladies' and 'till girls'). </p> <p>It is a tribute to the power of food, and passionate writing, that even cooks and eaters from these inferior categories may find his book hard to resist. </p> <p> <strong> Books and Company <br>Issue Nine: Winter 2000</strong> </p> <p>Subscription \u00a330 p/a, pp108<br><a href=\"http://www.booksandcompany.co.uk\">www.booksandcompany.co.uk</a></p> <p>Susan's Hill's quarterly literary journal 'about books for those who delight in them' is exactly what it claims to be.

Books and Company Issue Nine: Winter 2000 Subscription \u00a330 p/a, pp108 www.booksandcompany.co.uk Susan's Hill's quarterly literary journal 'about books for those who delight in them' is exactly what it claims to be. Issue Nine celebrates an impressively wide range of writing, from Bulgakov to Vega, Virgil to Gaskell, for purposes ranging from nostalgia to foal-midwifery. What's more, its essays fulfil many functions: advice (on What Boys Read); pleasure (Polly Samson on bedside reading); cosy insiderishness (Nancy Mitford's niece on Mitford); recommendation (the insanely underrated Howard Jacobson); and education (The Trollope Society on... well, guess). Cultured, modest and faintly grand - more naturally a magazine for Hons rather than Rebels.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stevie Smith, spinster of the suburbs, preferred not to stir from Palmer's Green. But she turned her uneventful life into wonderful, eccentric copy. Sylvia Smith may not be a great writer but she and Stevie share more than their surname. Sylvia could be Stevie's working-class sister: unmarried, childless, a retired secretary with a similarly deadpan sense of humour who has never moved from London's East End. </p> <p>At 40, Sylvia took a hard look at her life and concluded she 'hadn't done much with it'. Now at 56, she has written a book about everything that has (and has not) happened to her: Misadventures. There is nothing more cheering than reading about other people's lack of success and I could not put down her unusual, deflated, hilarious book. It deserves to be a best-seller. But, if the rest of her life is anything to go by, it will be a flop. </p> <p>The book emphasises comic anonymity. This is the story of Anywoman. Jeremy Lewis, a shrewd former publisher, suggests that Sylvia is a mature Helen Fielding, a 'champion of those who seem on the surface at least embattled, defeated and horribly unsuccessful'. But this is missing the point. Sylvia Smith isn't making anything up. She is no Bridget Jones: she is the real thing. Even her goldfish are unlucky. Disliking their boring environs, they leap out of their bowl and stun themselves on the lino. Sylvia is doing the same thing: leaping out of her life and into print. </p> <p>She shies away from self-description, preferring incident to emotion. Her flat style is catching. Some chapters (each with its own title) are only a paragraph long; they are like matches that refuse to light. She finishes chapters with lines such as: 'Frank married someone else a few years later.' Or: 'Personnel think it would be nicer if they had a younger temp.' I note, too, that Sylvia always gives the exact age of those appearing in each brief instalment, as if age were the key to everything, including disappointment. </p> <p> <strong> The phone call </strong></p> <p><strong> I am 43. Sylvia is 56.</strong> </p> <p> I tell Sylvia I loved the book. 'Have you read it? she exclaims, astounded. 'I thought it was very funny.' 'Oh good, you're meant to find it funny.' I am surprised by her voice. I had expected a prudish voice to match her behaviour. (She went out with 100 men before she was 25 but all relationships were platonic. She dislikes it when men are too forward. But she talks as if each word might contain a triple entendre. How long would it take to walk to her flat from Leyton tube? 'I don't know. I never use the tube.' She thought the walk might take 'about seven minutes'. I said that would be fine. She said 'Oooh... it wouldn't suit me, it's raining.' I tell her I don't mind a walk. She says 'I've got a hairdryer...' </p> <p>I go at a brisk pace down Leyton High Road and finally reach Sylvia's front door. I am out of breath but not wet. The walk takes 25 minutes. </p> <p> <strong> The meeting </strong></p> <p><strong> I am (still) 43. Sylvia is 56.</strong> </p> <p> Sylvia comes to the door in a saffron yellow T-shirt in shiny material. Her trousers are black. 'I made them myself,' she tells me. She is thin and bold with a naughty laugh, like someone gargling down an illicit drink. She could be a 'resting' actress. Her eyes are kohled, her hair quite long. 'Do you want the hairdryer?' </p> <p>I decline. Sylvia trained as a hairdresser but gave up before completing her apprenticeship. She subsequently attempted to cut a friend's hair but could not get it even and eventually cut almost all of it off. </p> <p>When did she start writing? 'The idea came into my head when I was 43. I am 56 now. You can make a note I don't look it, if you like.' (She gives one of her incredible laughs at this). Rain is hammering down on the plastic roof of the kitchen and she introduces me to the flat as if it were a close friend. We sit down on her sofa. 'It folds out into a double bed,' she remarks. I look around. It is like being inside a toy box full of pretty trinkets and buffeted toys. 'There are eight bedsits here. I've been in my little studio two and a half years. Do you want some biscuits?' </p> <p>There was almost no editorial interference with the book. 'I worked very hard, sometimes three hours on one page.' The title is her own. What do her friends think of it? 'I asked this married girlfriend whether she liked it. She said, \"Not particularly.\" Then I asked her if she had found it funny. She said, \"No. Not at all.\" ' </p> <p> <strong> Three photographs</strong> </p> <p> There are three framed photographs on a coffee table. The first is of Sylvia as a little girl in a white frock with a forest behind her. 'It is my back garden in Walthamstow,' she explains. She is wearing a huge hat and frowning. 'You look cross,' I say. She puts her glasses on, and stares at the picture: 'No. It's total innocence, isn't it? Look at my big, fat face.' She is critical of her dress, too. 'Look how my dress goes up at the front.' </p> <p>Second: Gertrude Elizabeth and Walter Smith, her paternal grandparents. They appear miserably awed by the camera. Walter longs to get away. Gertrude wears a black belt that looks uncomfortable. Gertrude's maiden name was Smith, then she married a Smith: 'Miss Smith became Mrs Smith.' </p> <p>Third: Reginald John Smith, Sylvia's father. She praises his smile (as if it were an achievement at his age). He died a few years ago, at 92, of a 'massive heart attack'. She was recalled from a 'four-day holiday at Ramsgate.' She had to arrange the funeral which was 'awful'. 'But I've spent my life sorting out things.' She says: 'My parents were funny in a way.' One hand flickers like a bird scarer. Had her mother read the book? 'With difficulty, through a magnifying glass. She thinks it is fabulous. She thinks everything I do is fabulous.' </p> <p> <strong> Husbands and other 'h' words</strong> </p> <p> I ask her if she could live her life again, what she would do differently? 'I don't go around thinking of my life,' she says (as if the idea were indecent). Would she describe it as very disappointing? 'No. A bit disappointing.' The love of her life was a Greek boyfriend, Heracles, whom she met in the Caf\u00e9 de Paris, off Leicester Square when he was 27 and she was 25. She tells us how to pronounce his name: 'The H is silent. You then say 'error' and join it to the surname of John Cleese the actor and you have the name \"Heracles\".'Heracles does seem to have been an error. Twenty years after they parted, she found a Christmas card from him on which he had written: 'I remember you and every moment of the quite long time we spent together... ' She realised how much he must have loved her. 'I sat and cried.' </p> <p>In the book, Sylvia explains she is bad at judging when a melon is ripe. I suggest she may be bad at judging when her romances are ripe too. Did she regret not marrying Heracles? 'No. I had such a traumatic time with him; he had a bad time with me.' Does she wish she had married someone else? 'No. I don't go around looking for a husband.' (This is in the same fastidious tone in which she explained she does not go around thinking about her life.) 'If I meet someone nice I go out with him.' So she would not like a husband? 'No. I don't want one particularly.' </p> <p>The other boyfriend who lasted was Ali, a Turk. 'I still see Ali but only on a friendly basis.' Her most successful relationships were not with Englishmen. Does she find them boring? 'Yes. It might be because I know them. I've fallen in love with all the foreigners - or most of them... ' </p> <p> <strong> Children</strong> </p> <p> Sylvia's grandmother, wearer of the uncomfortable belt, had nine children. She complained to her husband about his attentions and 'would jump down the entire staircase in her house in the early stages of pregnancy in the hope of losing her unborn child'. Sylvia is not sure why anyone wants children. 'One fella I know says he loves his children but they drive him mad. Children can give you a whole lot of grief. The children I see with my friends are so badly behaved, I don't know how they put up with them. I am delighted I haven't got any. Do you have children? You do? Oh well you probably know what that fella was talking about.' </p> <p> <strong> Other lives</strong> </p> <p> If she could choose to be someone else, who would it be? 'Elizabeth Taylor without the illnesses. If it is with the illnesses, forget it. She swelled up with about six double chins. But she certainly lived her life.' What if she could come back as a man? 'Prince Charles without the sadness. He is lovely. He doesn't show his personality but he has a fantastic sense of humour inside there. I saw him on television at a kids' party; he was blowing on makebelieve cups of tea. Just don't ask me about Camilla.' </p> <p> <strong> The Car</strong> </p> <p> Curiously, Sylvia will talk about men but not about her car. It is off the record. Not that anyone should drive off with the wrong idea about it. It is nothing fancy. But she told me where she likes to go in it: 'Usually, at about noon I take myself to Epping market and have a cheap lunch. I thoroughly enjoy a nice little drive. One of my hobbies is shopping. And I like to have a big breakfast in Tescos. And I like to go to charity shops.' She has been unemployed for years. 'I've had nine years off. It has been absolutely lovely. Why would I want to go to work?' </p> <p> <strong> Sylvia's most recent misadventure</strong> </p> <p> 'Me and my neighbour kept getting mice. So I bought a kitten called Tommy. He was a beautiful little thing. He was all right for about four days. But he started to put up a fight about everything. And he kept going for my mother's legs. I disposed of him. He was far worse than I had anticipated. </p> <p> <strong> A wave of the handkerchief...</strong> </p> <p> She hopes 'everyone who ever knew me will go out and buy the book and read about themselves'. Would she like to see people she has lost touch with? 'I'd love to see my old friends regardless of whether we fell out. It was probably 50/50...' Has she ever felt self-pity? 'I am not going to answer your question. It is too long a story to go into it. But I am not bitter.' She isn't. Earlier, she caught me sniffing and jumped up to open a glass closet inside which there was a bulk supply of travel-sized paper handkerchiefs. 'Take the packet,' she said. Just now, she is giving them away. </p> <p><strong>Sylvia's Stories: Two Chapters from 'Misadventures'</strong></p> <p><strong> 1969 </strong></p> <p><strong>Bob </strong></p> <p> <strong>Bob was 30. I was 24. We met at a dance at the Empire ballroom in Leicester Square. We had one date.</strong> </p> <p>Bob invited me to dinner at his flat one Thursday evening and we made arrangements that he would meet me by car at his local underground station. </p> <p>He cooked an excellent medium rare steak and French fries, served with a dressed salad and a glass of claret. </p> <p>After our meal we settled in his lounge with the remainder of the wine. I found him to be far too amorous. I turned down his advances and would do no more than kiss him. </p> <p>At the end of the evening he drove me back to the Tube and suggested I meet him there the following Thursday, but this time with a pound of sausages as he would have no time for shopping. </p> <p>The next Thursday I arrived at the underground station at the appointed hour but there was no Bob. After waiting 40 minutes and not knowing exactly where he lived and still there was no Bob, I went home, taking my sausages with me. </p> <p> <strong> 1981</strong> </p> <p><strong>The Indian Shopkeeper </strong></p> <p> <strong>He was short and middle-aged. I was 36</strong> </p> <p>I saw a beautiful green handbag in the window of an east London leatherware shop. But without its price tag. I entered the shop and asked the Indian shopkeeper how much it cost. He reached for the bag and passed it to me, saying: 'This is an excellent handbag in a very soft leather that I imported from France and I want \u00a375 for it.' It was much more than I had expected and I told him so. He showed me various cheaper bags but I didn't like any and left the shop. </p> <p>I walked along the High Road and the Indian shopkeeper caught up with me. He fell into step beside me and we strode along the main road together. He asked: 'Can I take you for a coffee?' I replied:'No thank you.' Undaunted he asked: 'Can I take you for a drink?' Again I replied: 'No thank you.' He then asked: 'Would you like to be my wife?' I was very surprised but once again I replied: 'No thank you.' He returned to his shop as I continued on my way. </p> <p> <strong> Misadventures is published by Canongate, \u00a39.99.

Would she like to see people she has lost touch with? 'I'd love to see my old friends regardless of whether we fell out. It was probably 50/50...' Has she ever felt self-pity? 'I am not going to answer your question. It is too long a story to go into it. But I am not bitter.' She isn't. Earlier, she caught me sniffing and jumped up to open a glass closet inside which there was a bulk supply of travel-sized paper handkerchiefs. 'Take the packet,' she said. Just now, she is giving them away. Sylvia's Stories: Two Chapters from 'Misadventures' 1969 Bob Bob was 30. I was 24. We met at a dance at the Empire ballroom in Leicester Square. We had one date. Bob invited me to dinner at his flat one Thursday evening and we made arrangements that he would meet me by car at his local underground station. He cooked an excellent medium rare steak and French fries, served with a dressed salad and a glass of claret. After our meal we settled in his lounge with the remainder of the wine. I found him to be far too amorous. I turned down his advances and would do no more than kiss him. At the end of the evening he drove me back to the Tube and suggested I meet him there the following Thursday, but this time with a pound of sausages as he would have no time for shopping. The next Thursday I arrived at the underground station at the appointed hour but there was no Bob. After waiting 40 minutes and not knowing exactly where he lived and still there was no Bob, I went home, taking my sausages with me. 1981 The Indian Shopkeeper He was short and middle-aged. I was 36 I saw a beautiful green handbag in the window of an east London leatherware shop. But without its price tag. I entered the shop and asked the Indian shopkeeper how much it cost. He reached for the bag and passed it to me, saying: 'This is an excellent handbag in a very soft leather that I imported from France and I want \u00a375 for it.' It was much more than I had expected and I told him so. He showed me various cheaper bags but I didn't like any and left the shop. I walked along the High Road and the Indian shopkeeper caught up with me. He fell into step beside me and we strode along the main road together. He asked: 'Can I take you for a coffee?' I replied:'No thank you.' Undaunted he asked: 'Can I take you for a drink?' Again I replied: 'No thank you.' He then asked: 'Would you like to be my wife?' I was very surprised but once again I replied: 'No thank you.' He returned to his shop as I continued on my way. Misadventures is published by Canongate, \u00a39.99.

      "body": "<p>It's the tail end of 1999 and a dusty road in Coffeytown, Kansas leads to the largest warehouse anyone round these parts has ever thought to conceive of. Inside, 300 residents sit rapt before a makeshift podium as the voice of America's most controversial businessman reverberates through a million square feet of near-empty space. He gives them a well-practised spiel about their company's mission, about the sanctity of the customer and misguidedness of critics who have been lining up to trash the vision he is inviting them to share. He is their boss, but he's so much more than that. This edifice is one of five state-of-the-art distribution facilities scattered across the US like New Economy fairy dust. To some, Jeff Bezos represents, even embodies, the future. To others, he is a self-deluding billionaire conman. His online trading company, amazon.com, has never made a profit. Time magazine crowned him its Man of the Year anyway. </p> <p>But here comes the strange part. At the end of Bezos's talk, there is a brief question-and-answer session. He is asked what his new house - a $10m mansion, not far from Bill Gates's on the 'gold coast' of Lake Washington in Seattle - looks like. He is asked how many items Amazon sells and where he got the name from: his first choice had been abracadabra.com, but his lawyer had heard this over the phone as 'cadaver.com', after which it didn't seem such a good idea. Then, finally, a woman in the front row gets up and asks a question the outwardly modest and self-effacing Bezos wasn't expecting. </p> <p>'Can I have your autograph?' </p> <p>He smiles and nods and she approaches, closely followed by the first four rows, and the ones behind, before virtually everyone in the room is crowded round, handing over dollar bills, scraps of paper, the hard hats they wear, to be anointed by the chairman. </p> <p>All of which is by way of saying that, at the end of 1999, Chief Executive Officers of new technology firms have fans and groupies and stalkers, like pop stars or matin\u00e9e idols. The world seems to be turning upside down. And though neither Bezos nor his purring shareholders and staff knows it, before the next year is out, it'll turn again. </p> <p> And if thrusting techie CEOs are the film stars of the modern age, Jeff Bezos, in his plain button-down shirts and chinos, cuts an unlikely but indisputable Errol Flynn. Few people on earth would have the stomach for the ride he's had over the past five years since he borrowed his parents' $300,000 retirement money and began selling books over the internet from his garage. The first tranche of staff he recruited all became millionaires. When it was floated on the stock market on 15 May 1997, Amazon shares were valued at $1.50. Precisely 19 months later, they stood at $242.75. Three weeks after that, they shot past $400. $400! The $300,000 his mother had lent him with a concerned 'Can't you just keep your day job, dear, and do this part time?' was now worth $79,800,000 and while the stock was 'split' three times and had levelled out at a saner-looking figure of $107 by the end of 1999, this still represented a staggering return in real terms. </p> <p>At this time, Fortune magazine was estimating Bezos's personal paper wealth at close to $10bn, more than the GDP of Iceland. Venture capitalists were still lining up to bankroll anyone with an idea for an internet-based enterprise and Amazon's founder had emerged as the standard bearer, the brilliant king of cybercommerce whose daring business plan involved spending heavily on infrastructure and buy-outs of smaller players while such opportunities existed, on the grounds that the thrilling chaos of this frontier economy wouldn't last forever. He had begun with books, then decided to sell everything, taking on Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders and Wal-Mart, and was losing money hand over fist: $390m in 1999 alone, on revenues of $1.6bn. Sceptics were beginning to wonder how long it would be before Amazon simply ran out of cash. They provided nicknames like 'amazon.con', 'amazon.toast', 'amazon.bomb' and, Bezos's avowed personal favourite, 'amazon.org' (the 'org' handle usually being used to denote a non-profit organisation). </p> <p>Bezos looked to be playing a dangerous game, raising the stakes higher and higher still with each passing month, moving expensively into the UK, France and Germany. Nevertheless, things still looked good when, on 10 March 2000, the Nasdaq hi-tech share index rose to an all-time high of 5,132. Bullish commentators were speculating that this boom, unlike those of the past, could go on forever. Then, the very next week, the bottom dropped out of the dotcom market, as investors finally realised that they'd been sold a pup; that the same rules concerning visibility and service and cash flow attached to e-commerce as to any other kind of business. In the UK, the Techmark index fell from a high of 5,743 to 2,864. Since then, another dotcom start-up has crashed, on average, every day. The worldwide web is becoming littered with lonely 'ghost sites', each a testament to the broken dreams of another would-be Bezos. You can find a long list of them on the net at the e-museum. </p> <p>Suddenly Amazon, whose business plan had been so widely emulated, became the subject of intense scrutiny. Shares temporarily stabilised at around $30, but at the time of writing stand at less than $19. Bezos made a show of unflappability, painting the crash as a return to normalcy, to rationality on the part of investors, but the anxiety surrounding him was palpable. If Amazon went down, it was whispered, the whole 'New Economy' would be revealed as a chimera. Furthermore, Amazon staff were paid partly with shares in the company and had been forced to stand by helplessly and watch their wealth collapse. Last July, a report from market analysts at Lehman Brothers predicted that the organisation would run out of cash early this year. An accountancy professor at the London Business School is notorious for having bet his students that the crunch would come in the second quarter. </p> <p>Ten days ago, Amazon announced that it would be ditching 15 per cent of its 8,000-strong workforce and closing one of its distribution centres. The buffeted workers in Coffeytown must have breathed a sigh of relief when they heard that the loser was to be Georgia, not Kansas. At the same time, the figures for the fourth quarter of 2000, which included Christmas and was thought to be crucial to the company's survival, were inconclusive. Nevertheless, Bezos was upbeat and brazenly optimistic as ever. If he's not just another Wall Street morality tale at the end of all this, he could be the last man standing. And if that happens, Bill Gates's success at Microsoft will look like a drop in the cyber ocean by comparison. As one acquaintance says, 'Jeff, he's a sweet guy. But he's so tough.' </p> <p> Amazon's Pac Med building stands imperiously on a hill overlooking the twinkling business district of Seattle. It is beautiful: a former state hospital built in a Deco style in 1928, from red brick and glass, on a site donated to the government by Seattle's elders. An ornate marble and brass reception area opens into a network of open-plan communal spaces, mazes of the tiny, dour grey cubbyholes tech firms seem to favour for their junior staff, and austere offices, each sporting one of Bezos's trademark homemade desks, which are fashioned out of DIY store-bought doors. Boxes of extraneous items - big stuffed toys, vintage model cars, novelty clocks - spill from boxes, waiting to be auctioned or swapped through the website. The canteen looks and feels like a gastro pub. </p> <p>It's hardly an exaggeration to say that you can hear Jeff Bezos coming from two floors away. Anyone will tell you that the most distinctive thing about him is his laugh. Sometimes it is a mere roar - huuaaaarrrhhahahaha! - at others, mostly in moments of stress or discomfort, what you get is a full-scale explosion... ahhahrhaHAHRHAHRHAHR AAAHHHHHRRRR!!! Often you can spot one of these coming and have to struggle to stop yourself from diving under the table for shelter... duck for cover. Blaawwwwww!! It's an endearing and, perhaps more to the point, disarming trait in someone whose whole life depends on the whims of a bunch of jumpy gamblers (ie 'investors'), and may help to explain why almost no one has a bad word to say about Jeff Bezos once they've met him. When I comment on the laugh later, he chuckles and offers, 'Well, I come from a long line of goofy people.' You find yourself thinking that such outsize bonhomie must be a defence mechanism of some kind, but if so, it runs deep. </p> <p>'My wife always says, \"If Jeff's in a bad mood, just leave him for three minutes, then he'll be OK,\"' he tells me when I question his evident lack of angst. </p> <p>Either way, Jeff Bezos is not what you were expecting. </p> <p>In fact, if Bezos was the only factor in all of this, no one would bet against him. The words which feature most prominently in any telling of his story are 'first' and 'youngest'. His father, Mike Bezos, left Cuba, alone, at the age of 15, shortly after Castro's revolution. At that time, the US was accepting refugees with open arms and the young Bezos was taken to Delaware by Catholic missionaries, who fed, clothed, educated him and ultimately sent him to college. When he met his future wife in Albuquerque, New Mexico, she already had Jeff, whom she'd given birth to at the age of 17 while involved in a turbulent marriage which only lasted a year. Her son didn't learn until he was eight that Mike Bezos was not his biological father, and if he has had any inclination to track the other man down, he admits it to no one. </p> <p>'As far as I'm concerned, I only have one dad and he's my real dad,' he states bluntly. </p> <p>Did his parents face any prejudice over their mixed marriage in the South of the early 60s? </p> <p>'If they did, I never recognised it. You're right, of course, that's a possibility, there's a lot of prejudice in the world. But he's an incredibly funny and charming person. I can't imagine anyone taking against him. Arharharharhhar!' </p> <p> The childhood he describes is idyllic, defined by loving parents and doting grandparents, particularly his maternal grandfather, after whom Bezos named his 11-month-old son, Preston. He was recognised as bright early on and went to a school for gifted children. Geeky and awkward, he got picked on, but not so badly as he might have done elsewhere. In the first grade (at the age of six), he wanted to be an archaeologist, he thinks, because someone taught him how to spell the word and he was proud of it. After the moon landing in 1969, he wanted to be an astronaut and admits with boyish enthusiasm that 'that's still on my list of things to do, if it ever becomes practical'. Eventually, he would go to Princeton with the aim of becoming a theoretical physicist. He was always top of his class - though even now, he doesn't parade his intellect, hoving it into view only when absolutely necessary. All his energies seem focused on making everyone in his immediate orbit feel comfortable. To be so relentlessly, unfeasibly nice must be draining and I find a kind of heroism in it, whether it's a true reflection of what's going on inside or not. Perhaps even more if it's not. </p> <p>At Princeton, something unexpected happened. He met people who were as smart as him. In fact, some who were smarter. </p> <p>'I went to Princeton specifically to study physics,' he says evenly, 'and found out, by the time I got to quantum mechanics... I was doing well, but it was so much work for me, it was hard - and there were half a dozen people in my class who were so gifted, and their brains were just wired in a different way, and the things that I worked so hard to do came so effortlessly to them... and it was...' </p> <p>Brace yourself. </p> <p>'Eerharhahrhahrhahrhar!!' </p> <p>You mean it was disappointing. </p> <p>'Well, it was certainly... I would say it was a combination of shocking and awe inspiring. It was sort of, \"Wow, this is incredible that some people can process these incredibly abstract concepts so gracefully\"... So anyway, I realised that I was going to be a mediocre theoretical physicist - herhehrhehrher!' </p> <p>And there's probably not a lot of call for that? </p> <p>'Exactly, you just hit the nail on the head. Mediocre theoretical physicists make no progress. They spend all their time understanding other people's progress. Aarharhaherhahtrerh! So once I got over the pain, huhuhuhuhuhuhh...' </p> <p>So it was painful? </p> <p>'Actually, not as painful as awe-inspiring.' </p> <p>OK. Fortunately, Bezos had also been conducting a love affair with early computers since his days at school, so he refocused on that, 'as a space that I could swim through'. He left Princeton and, by the age of 26, had become the youngest-ever vice-president of the Bankers Trust Company. In December 1990, he moved to DE Shaw &amp; Co, a high-end company specialising in arcane financial transactions, where he specialised in spotting new business opportunities and became the youngest-ever senior vice-president at age 28. It was here that the idea of Amazon was born, but first there was another deal to be brokered. At 27, Bezos decided it was time to find a wife. Adapting the business term 'deal flow' to his purposes, he decided that what he needed in his life was more 'women flow'. So he instructed his friends to start arranging blind dates. His only hope for his future wife was that she should be 'someone resourceful enough to get me out of a Third-World prison'. That was all. It didn't work. </p> <p>'But it was fun!' He guffaws. 'Because what happens if you go on lots of blind dates is that, like anything, you get good at them. So you end up only meeting other people who are very good at going on blind dates. So then what happens is that you get to the level of sophistication where you can both agree in seven or eight minutes that it's not going to work out. But you can have a nice dinner. HERHERHEHRHER! Without any pressure. And then most of the dinner conversation is about blind dates. And dating techniques.' </p> <p>But he was extremely wealthy at that point. And, as we've established, a winning personality. He must have been a catch. </p> <p>'Oh, they certainly didn't see it that way!!!' The ensuing convulsion seems to last for about a minute and a half. 'Ah. Hmmm. I should have had you as my PR person. Ah. No. I think that, ah, I'm a very goofy sort of person in many ways. I tell duff jokes. I kind of have to grow on somebody. I'm not the kind of person you meet and kind of go, \"Oh I love this guy!\" and it's great and you go home and tell all your girlfriends about him. That's not me.' </p> <p>Huge laugh. Perversely, though, these qualities are probably tremendous aids to forming a strong, lasting relationship, and you find yourself rooting for Bezos as he describes meeting his eventual wife, McKenzie, at work, and there being no immediate attraction between them, just a slow dawning on both sides, mostly formed in the company of others until 'it became obvious to both of us, but nobody wanted to say anything'. It sounds like an episode of Ally McBeal , I venture. </p> <p>'Yeah, ub, ah, indeed . It was exactly like that.' </p> <p>He smiles. </p> <p> While Bezos was at DE Shaw, he noticed that usage of the internet was growing exponentially. Until 1994, the net, which had been developed by the military as a means of keeping their computers talking in the event of nuclear attack and was subsequently handed over to academics, had been a commerce-free zone. Bezos began to look for ways of exploiting it and ended up in the world of books, which was not dominated by a few key players the way the music industry was, and had been neglected by mail-order firms on the grounds that a proper catalogue would need to run to millions of entries. What's more, books didn't go out of date almost as soon as they'd been published the way computer software does. At that time, the venture capitalists who would eventually gorge on e-com merce didn't know or want to know about the internet, so Bezos raised the money he needed from individuals. The rest, we know. </p> <p>The trouble with talking to Bezos about the trials of leading a new form of industry from the front is that all of the things which make it interesting are off limits to him. Any admission of doubt or vulnerability on his part could impact on Amazon's share price. So all he can do is trot out the well-worked mission and policy statements. He talks about there being no such thing as a New Economy, about ideas and knowledge being paramount in the future and this being an improvement on the old imperialist capitalism, whereby 'the only way your country could get richer was by going and stealing somebody else's gold'. He gives you the guff about wanting to create 'the world's most consumer-centric company', and about most of the failed dotcoms having neglected elementary rules of business. Boo.com, for instance, made the 'amateurish mistake' of trying to open simultaneously in 18 countries. But when I ask him if the burden of leadership ever feels onerous, his blunt reply, which shoots back way too quickly to be real, is: 'No. No .' </p> <p>Still, this man could end up as the most powerful magnate on the planet, and we want to know how, if at all, his corporation and its methods are going to differ from those of the past. When it was just books, Amazon seemed like such a charming idea. Now that they're moving into every area of our lives, what's to stop them from becoming little more than an online alternative to Wal-Mart, the US retailing behemoth that piles 'em high and keeps wages down? The briefest flicker of anger flashes across Bezos's face. It's so out of character as to be startling. </p> <p>'No, definitely not.' </p> <p>Why? </p> <p>'Because we're building something completely new. Online retailing won't replace in-store retailing. I've never said that. But I do think that it can be a different, enriching experience. I think shopping on the internet can be a more social experience in many ways. I don't know about you, but most of my exchanges with cashiers are not that meaningful... \"Have a nice day\"... \"You're welcome\"... \"No, we don't take credit cards.\" I mean, I love browsing around independent bookstores. But even there, the store doesn't instantly customise itself to suit your interests the way ours does and no one can tell you what other people who buy the books you're buying also bought. And you can't read your neighbours' reviews the way we allow you to. Those kind of community features can only be done online. And you can't have universal selection in a store, however big it is.' </p> <p>All of this is true. Amazon, with its new presence in the UK (amazon.co.uk) is virtually alone among its peers in being efficient and pleasurable to use. And I can vouch for their reputation for finding anything: they once secured an obscure book of poetry - secondhand, in Australia - for a friend of mine who had tried every other means of locating one, and charged her $5.99 for it. There is no way that they could have made money on the transaction. </p> <p>Which brings us back to where we began. You would have to be a freak to dislike Jeff Bezos. Up to now, you'd have to be pretty screwy not to admire Amazon. But this won't ensure its survival. Everywhere you go, you find doubters. </p> <p>'Amazon has established itself as the dominant brand,' says a senior editor on the online business magazine Wired , 'but there's a question over whether anyone gives a damn about brands on the internet - there are sophisticated arguments on both sides. Also, there is no internet tax right now, but Clinton said there would be one day. This is a Sword of Damocles hanging over all online retailers.' </p> <p>Others have pointed out that Amazon is effectively borrowing a huge amount of money from its employees; that if it simultaneously decided to exercise its 16m share options at $19 a share, $304m would immediately be drained from the business. Also, there is a logistical problem in having expanded so rapidly while still making a loss, which was identified by Scott Sipprelle of the Midtown Research Group more than a year ago, when the business climate was far more favourable than it is now. </p> <p>'The chance of a painful failure goes up as they increase the chips on the table,' he said. 'Just look at the metrics. As the company grows in scale, the absolute dollars it's losing are greater and greater: debt is going up, margins are going down and cash burn is increasing.' </p> <p>Bezos's stock response to this is that he is 'comfortable with our cash position', and that the book, CD, video and electronics divisions are now doing well, which proves that the business plan works. Overall losses for the fourth quarter of 2000, at $90.4m, still amounted to 25 cents a share, though that's an improvement on the 55 cents per share lost in the same sector of 1999. Daniel Peris, of Argus Research in New York, claims that Amazon is being strengthened by the demise of other e-tailers, drawing a parallel with the early days of the car industry. </p> <p>'Did the disappearance of 2,700 carmakers at the turn of the century call into question the future of the car?' he asks. 'Absolutely not. It was just a consolidation around the leading manufacturers. Amazon is in a race against the clock to start generating cash before they run out of it, but I am now less concerned about their running out of money.' </p> <p>So no one knows and, looking at all this, my final question to Jeff Bezos is a more prosaic one. </p> <p>I mean, why bother? </p> <p>The old-style bookstores served us well for centuries. What's more, while everyone loves a bookseller, no one cares much for purveyors of garden furniture. As already mentioned, the company is about to lay off 15 per cent of its workforce and has been quietly resisting unionisation. One employee accuses them of 'beginning to act in a traditionally corporate way', and Wall Street has been murmuring sinister approval. Bezos makes a show of cherishing the 'Amazon culture' he has created, which is based on the fact that all employees are also owners and therefore have no need of unions. Yet, like many idealists, he assumes that everyone who works for him is like him, neglecting the fact that not everyone will see what he sees when he looks to the future of Amazon. This is why idealists often end up behaving like hooligans. While share prices were rising, everyone was happy. Not any more. To Bezos, this is mystifying. </p> <p>So isn't there a law of diminishing returns in operation here? As the size of the operation increases, doesn't satisfaction decrease? He has enough money. He could retire now. </p> <p>Not for the first time, he surprises me. </p> <p>'What I felt from the beginning was that it's important to have a mission that's bigger than ourselves, the way Sony did after the Second World War,' he replies. 'They wanted to make Japan synonymous with quality, rather than cheap copies. And they succeeded brilliantly. Our mission is to create a new level of expectation in customers, which will cause all companies to raise their level. And if we can do that, that would be truly meaningful. That'll be something we can tell our grandchildren about. That's the difference between a mission and a job. If it's a job, then you won't have stories to tell your grandchildren.' </p> <p>It seems scarcely credible, but he seems to mean it. And as he speaks, this image forms in my head of an idealistic young man in another age, standing on a campus, chanting slogans at an anti-Vietnam War demonstration. Having had no war to fight, the idealists of Bezos's generation went to the frontline of the technology business. Where else could they have gone? And I wonder if they'll make more, or less, difference than their predecessors.</p> <p><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,436246,00.html\">How dotcoms drowned in a tide of hope and hype</a></p> <p><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,436248,00.html\">New economy tycoons who flew too close to the sun</a></p>",

The world seems to be turning upside down. And though neither Bezos nor his purring shareholders and staff knows it, before the next year is out, it'll turn again. And if thrusting techie CEOs are the film stars of the modern age, Jeff Bezos, in his plain button-down shirts and chinos, cuts an unlikely but indisputable Errol Flynn. Few people on earth would have the stomach for the ride he's had over the past five years since he borrowed his parents' $300,000 retirement money and began selling books over the internet from his garage. The first tranche of staff he recruited all became millionaires. When it was floated on the stock market on 15 May 1997, Amazon shares were valued at $1.50. Precisely 19 months later, they stood at $242.75. Three weeks after that, they shot past $400. $400! The $300,000 his mother had lent him with a concerned 'Can't you just keep your day job, dear, and do this part time?' was now worth $79,800,000 and while the stock was 'split' three times and had levelled out at a saner-looking figure of $107 by the end of 1999, this still represented a staggering return in real terms. At this time, Fortune magazine was estimating Bezos's personal paper wealth at close to $10bn, more than the GDP of Iceland. Venture capitalists were still lining up to bankroll anyone with an idea for an internet-based enterprise and Amazon's founder had emerged as the standard bearer, the brilliant king of cybercommerce whose daring business plan involved spending heavily on infrastructure and buy-outs of smaller players while such opportunities existed, on the grounds that the thrilling chaos of this frontier economy wouldn't last forever. He had begun with books, then decided to sell everything, taking on Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders and Wal-Mart, and was losing money hand over fist: $390m in 1999 alone, on revenues of $1.6bn. Sceptics were beginning to wonder how long it would be before Amazon simply ran out of cash. They provided nicknames like 'amazon.con', 'amazon.toast', 'amazon.bomb' and, Bezos's avowed personal favourite, 'amazon.org' (the 'org' handle usually being used to denote a non-profit organisation). Bezos looked to be playing a dangerous game, raising the stakes higher and higher still with each passing month, moving expensively into the UK, France and Germany. Nevertheless, things still looked good when, on 10 March 2000, the Nasdaq hi-tech share index rose to an all-time high of 5,132. Bullish commentators were speculating that this boom, unlike those of the past, could go on forever. Then, the very next week, the bottom dropped out of the dotcom market, as investors finally realised that they'd been sold a pup; that the same rules concerning visibility and service and cash flow attached to e-commerce as to any other kind of business. In the UK, the Techmark index fell from a high of 5,743 to 2,864. Since then, another dotcom start-up has crashed, on average, every day. The worldwide web is becoming littered with lonely 'ghost sites', each a testament to the broken dreams of another would-be Bezos. You can find a long list of them on the net at the e-museum. Suddenly Amazon, whose business plan had been so widely emulated, became the subject of intense scrutiny. Shares temporarily stabilised at around $30, but at the time of writing stand at less than $19. Bezos made a show of unflappability, painting the crash as a return to normalcy, to rationality on the part of investors, but the anxiety surrounding him was palpable. If Amazon went down, it was whispered, the whole 'New Economy' would be revealed as a chimera. Furthermore, Amazon staff were paid partly with shares in the company and had been forced to stand by helplessly and watch their wealth collapse. Last July, a report from market analysts at Lehman Brothers predicted that the organisation would run out of cash early this year. An accountancy professor at the London Business School is notorious for having bet his students that the crunch would come in the second quarter. Ten days ago, Amazon announced that it would be ditching 15 per cent of its 8,000-strong workforce and closing one of its distribution centres. The buffeted workers in Coffeytown must have breathed a sigh of relief when they heard that the loser was to be Georgia, not Kansas. At the same time, the figures for the fourth quarter of 2000, which included Christmas and was thought to be crucial to the company's survival, were inconclusive. Nevertheless, Bezos was upbeat and brazenly optimistic as ever. If he's not just another Wall Street morality tale at the end of all this, he could be the last man standing. And if that happens, Bill Gates's success at Microsoft will look like a drop in the cyber ocean by comparison. As one acquaintance says, 'Jeff, he's a sweet guy. But he's so tough.' Amazon's Pac Med building stands imperiously on a hill overlooking the twinkling business district of Seattle. It is beautiful: a former state hospital built in a Deco style in 1928, from red brick and glass, on a site donated to the government by Seattle's elders. An ornate marble and brass reception area opens into a network of open-plan communal spaces, mazes of the tiny, dour grey cubbyholes tech firms seem to favour for their junior staff, and austere offices, each sporting one of Bezos's trademark homemade desks, which are fashioned out of DIY store-bought doors. Boxes of extraneous items - big stuffed toys, vintage model cars, novelty clocks - spill from boxes, waiting to be auctioned or swapped through the website. The canteen looks and feels like a gastro pub. It's hardly an exaggeration to say that you can hear Jeff Bezos coming from two floors away. Anyone will tell you that the most distinctive thing about him is his laugh. Sometimes it is a mere roar - huuaaaarrrhhahahaha! - at others, mostly in moments of stress or discomfort, what you get is a full-scale explosion... ahhahrhaHAHRHAHRHAHR AAAHHHHHRRRR!!! Often you can spot one of these coming and have to struggle to stop yourself from diving under the table for shelter... duck for cover. Blaawwwwww!! It's an endearing and, perhaps more to the point, disarming trait in someone whose whole life depends on the whims of a bunch of jumpy gamblers (ie 'investors'), and may help to explain why almost no one has a bad word to say about Jeff Bezos once they've met him. When I comment on the laugh later, he chuckles and offers, 'Well, I come from a long line of goofy people.' You find yourself thinking that such outsize bonhomie must be a defence mechanism of some kind, but if so, it runs deep. 'My wife always says, \"If Jeff's in a bad mood, just leave him for three minutes, then he'll be OK,\"' he tells me when I question his evident lack of angst. Either way, Jeff Bezos is not what you were expecting. In fact, if Bezos was the only factor in all of this, no one would bet against him. The words which feature most prominently in any telling of his story are 'first' and 'youngest'. His father, Mike Bezos, left Cuba, alone, at the age of 15, shortly after Castro's revolution. At that time, the US was accepting refugees with open arms and the young Bezos was taken to Delaware by Catholic missionaries, who fed, clothed, educated him and ultimately sent him to college. When he met his future wife in Albuquerque, New Mexico, she already had Jeff, whom she'd given birth to at the age of 17 while involved in a turbulent marriage which only lasted a year. Her son didn't learn until he was eight that Mike Bezos was not his biological father, and if he has had any inclination to track the other man down, he admits it to no one. 'As far as I'm concerned, I only have one dad and he's my real dad,' he states bluntly. Did his parents face any prejudice over their mixed marriage in the South of the early 60s? 'If they did, I never recognised it. You're right, of course, that's a possibility, there's a lot of prejudice in the world. But he's an incredibly funny and charming person. I can't imagine anyone taking against him. Arharharharhhar!' The childhood he describes is idyllic, defined by loving parents and doting grandparents, particularly his maternal grandfather, after whom Bezos named his 11-month-old son, Preston. He was recognised as bright early on and went to a school for gifted children. Geeky and awkward, he got picked on, but not so badly as he might have done elsewhere. In the first grade (at the age of six), he wanted to be an archaeologist, he thinks, because someone taught him how to spell the word and he was proud of it. After the moon landing in 1969, he wanted to be an astronaut and admits with boyish enthusiasm that 'that's still on my list of things to do, if it ever becomes practical'. Eventually, he would go to Princeton with the aim of becoming a theoretical physicist. He was always top of his class - though even now, he doesn't parade his intellect, hoving it into view only when absolutely necessary. All his energies seem focused on making everyone in his immediate orbit feel comfortable. To be so relentlessly, unfeasibly nice must be draining and I find a kind of heroism in it, whether it's a true reflection of what's going on inside or not. Perhaps even more if it's not. At Princeton, something unexpected happened. He met people who were as smart as him. In fact, some who were smarter. 'I went to Princeton specifically to study physics,' he says evenly, 'and found out, by the time I got to quantum mechanics... I was doing well, but it was so much work for me, it was hard - and there were half a dozen people in my class who were so gifted, and their brains were just wired in a different way, and the things that I worked so hard to do came so effortlessly to them... and it was...' Brace yourself. 'Eerharhahrhahrhahrhar!!' You mean it was disappointing. 'Well, it was certainly... I would say it was a combination of shocking and awe inspiring. It was sort of, \"Wow, this is incredible that some people can process these incredibly abstract concepts so gracefully\"... So anyway, I realised that I was going to be a mediocre theoretical physicist - herhehrhehrher!' And there's probably not a lot of call for that? 'Exactly, you just hit the nail on the head. Mediocre theoretical physicists make no progress. They spend all their time understanding other people's progress. Aarharhaherhahtrerh! So once I got over the pain, huhuhuhuhuhuhh...' So it was painful? 'Actually, not as painful as awe-inspiring.' OK. Fortunately, Bezos had also been conducting a love affair with early computers since his days at school, so he refocused on that, 'as a space that I could swim through'. He left Princeton and, by the age of 26, had become the youngest-ever vice-president of the Bankers Trust Company. In December 1990, he moved to DE Shaw &amp; Co, a high-end company specialising in arcane financial transactions, where he specialised in spotting new business opportunities and became the youngest-ever senior vice-president at age 28. It was here that the idea of Amazon was born, but first there was another deal to be brokered. At 27, Bezos decided it was time to find a wife. Adapting the business term 'deal flow' to his purposes, he decided that what he needed in his life was more 'women flow'. So he instructed his friends to start arranging blind dates. His only hope for his future wife was that she should be 'someone resourceful enough to get me out of a Third-World prison'. That was all. It didn't work. 'But it was fun!' He guffaws. 'Because what happens if you go on lots of blind dates is that, like anything, you get good at them. So you end up only meeting other people who are very good at going on blind dates. So then what happens is that you get to the level of sophistication where you can both agree in seven or eight minutes that it's not going to work out. But you can have a nice dinner. HERHERHEHRHER! Without any pressure. And then most of the dinner conversation is about blind dates. And dating techniques.' But he was extremely wealthy at that point. And, as we've established, a winning personality. He must have been a catch. 'Oh, they certainly didn't see it that way!!!' The ensuing convulsion seems to last for about a minute and a half. 'Ah. Hmmm. I should have had you as my PR person. Ah. No. I think that, ah, I'm a very goofy sort of person in many ways. I tell duff jokes. I kind of have to grow on somebody. I'm not the kind of person you meet and kind of go, \"Oh I love this guy!\" and it's great and you go home and tell all your girlfriends about him. That's not me.' Huge laugh. Perversely, though, these qualities are probably tremendous aids to forming a strong, lasting relationship, and you find yourself rooting for Bezos as he describes meeting his eventual wife, McKenzie, at work, and there being no immediate attraction between them, just a slow dawning on both sides, mostly formed in the company of others until 'it became obvious to both of us, but nobody wanted to say anything'. It sounds like an episode of Ally McBeal , I venture. 'Yeah, ub, ah, indeed . It was exactly like that.' He smiles. While Bezos was at DE Shaw, he noticed that usage of the internet was growing exponentially. Until 1994, the net, which had been developed by the military as a means of keeping their computers talking in the event of nuclear attack and was subsequently handed over to academics, had been a commerce-free zone. Bezos began to look for ways of exploiting it and ended up in the world of books, which was not dominated by a few key players the way the music industry was, and had been neglected by mail-order firms on the grounds that a proper catalogue would need to run to millions of entries. What's more, books didn't go out of date almost as soon as they'd been published the way computer software does. At that time, the venture capitalists who would eventually gorge on e-com merce didn't know or want to know about the internet, so Bezos raised the money he needed from individuals. The rest, we know. The trouble with talking to Bezos about the trials of leading a new form of industry from the front is that all of the things which make it interesting are off limits to him. Any admission of doubt or vulnerability on his part could impact on Amazon's share price. So all he can do is trot out the well-worked mission and policy statements. He talks about there being no such thing as a New Economy, about ideas and knowledge being paramount in the future and this being an improvement on the old imperialist capitalism, whereby 'the only way your country could get richer was by going and stealing somebody else's gold'. He gives you the guff about wanting to create 'the world's most consumer-centric company', and about most of the failed dotcoms having neglected elementary rules of business. Boo.com, for instance, made the 'amateurish mistake' of trying to open simultaneously in 18 countries. But when I ask him if the burden of leadership ever feels onerous, his blunt reply, which shoots back way too quickly to be real, is: 'No. No .' Still, this man could end up as the most powerful magnate on the planet, and we want to know how, if at all, his corporation and its methods are going to differ from those of the past. When it was just books, Amazon seemed like such a charming idea. Now that they're moving into every area of our lives, what's to stop them from becoming little more than an online alternative to Wal-Mart, the US retailing behemoth that piles 'em high and keeps wages down? The briefest flicker of anger flashes across Bezos's face. It's so out of character as to be startling. 'No, definitely not.' Why? 'Because we're building something completely new. Online retailing won't replace in-store retailing. I've never said that. But I do think that it can be a different, enriching experience. I think shopping on the internet can be a more social experience in many ways. I don't know about you, but most of my exchanges with cashiers are not that meaningful... \"Have a nice day\"... \"You're welcome\"... \"No, we don't take credit cards.\" I mean, I love browsing around independent bookstores. But even there, the store doesn't instantly customise itself to suit your interests the way ours does and no one can tell you what other people who buy the books you're buying also bought. And you can't read your neighbours' reviews the way we allow you to. Those kind of community features can only be done online. And you can't have universal selection in a store, however big it is.' All of this is true. Amazon, with its new presence in the UK (amazon.co.uk) is virtually alone among its peers in being efficient and pleasurable to use. And I can vouch for their reputation for finding anything: they once secured an obscure book of poetry - secondhand, in Australia - for a friend of mine who had tried every other means of locating one, and charged her $5.99 for it. There is no way that they could have made money on the transaction. Which brings us back to where we began. You would have to be a freak to dislike Jeff Bezos. Up to now, you'd have to be pretty screwy not to admire Amazon. But this won't ensure its survival. Everywhere you go, you find doubters. 'Amazon has established itself as the dominant brand,' says a senior editor on the online business magazine Wired , 'but there's a question over whether anyone gives a damn about brands on the internet - there are sophisticated arguments on both sides. Also, there is no internet tax right now, but Clinton said there would be one day. This is a Sword of Damocles hanging over all online retailers.' Others have pointed out that Amazon is effectively borrowing a huge amount of money from its employees; that if it simultaneously decided to exercise its 16m share options at $19 a share, $304m would immediately be drained from the business. Also, there is a logistical problem in having expanded so rapidly while still making a loss, which was identified by Scott Sipprelle of the Midtown Research Group more than a year ago, when the business climate was far more favourable than it is now. 'The chance of a painful failure goes up as they increase the chips on the table,' he said. 'Just look at the metrics. As the company grows in scale, the absolute dollars it's losing are greater and greater: debt is going up, margins are going down and cash burn is increasing.' Bezos's stock response to this is that he is 'comfortable with our cash position', and that the book, CD, video and electronics divisions are now doing well, which proves that the business plan works. Overall losses for the fourth quarter of 2000, at $90.4m, still amounted to 25 cents a share, though that's an improvement on the 55 cents per share lost in the same sector of 1999. Daniel Peris, of Argus Research in New York, claims that Amazon is being strengthened by the demise of other e-tailers, drawing a parallel with the early days of the car industry. 'Did the disappearance of 2,700 carmakers at the turn of the century call into question the future of the car?' he asks. 'Absolutely not. It was just a consolidation around the leading manufacturers. Amazon is in a race against the clock to start generating cash before they run out of it, but I am now less concerned about their running out of money.' So no one knows and, looking at all this, my final question to Jeff Bezos is a more prosaic one. I mean, why bother? The old-style bookstores served us well for centuries. What's more, while everyone loves a bookseller, no one cares much for purveyors of garden furniture. As already mentioned, the company is about to lay off 15 per cent of its workforce and has been quietly resisting unionisation. One employee accuses them of 'beginning to act in a traditionally corporate way', and Wall Street has been murmuring sinister approval. Bezos makes a show of cherishing the 'Amazon culture' he has created, which is based on the fact that all employees are also owners and therefore have no need of unions. Yet, like many idealists, he assumes that everyone who works for him is like him, neglecting the fact that not everyone will see what he sees when he looks to the future of Amazon. This is why idealists often end up behaving like hooligans. While share prices were rising, everyone was happy. Not any more. To Bezos, this is mystifying. So isn't there a law of diminishing returns in operation here? As the size of the operation increases, doesn't satisfaction decrease? He has enough money. He could retire now. Not for the first time, he surprises me. 'What I felt from the beginning was that it's important to have a mission that's bigger than ourselves, the way Sony did after the Second World War,' he replies. 'They wanted to make Japan synonymous with quality, rather than cheap copies. And they succeeded brilliantly. Our mission is to create a new level of expectation in customers, which will cause all companies to raise their level. And if we can do that, that would be truly meaningful. That'll be something we can tell our grandchildren about. That's the difference between a mission and a job. If it's a job, then you won't have stories to tell your grandchildren.' It seems scarcely credible, but he seems to mean it. And as he speaks, this image forms in my head of an idealistic young man in another age, standing on a campus, chanting slogans at an anti-Vietnam War demonstration. Having had no war to fight, the idealists of Bezos's generation went to the frontline of the technology business. Where else could they have gone? And I wonder if they'll make more, or less, difference than their predecessors. How dotcoms drowned in a tide of hope and hype New economy tycoons who flew too close to the sun",

      "byline": "Robert McCrum",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This new year has seen the publication of two good new books, Edmund White's The Fl\u00e2neur: A Stroll Through the Paradoxes of Paris (Bloomsbury \u00a39.99) and Carol Shields's biography of Jane Austen (Weidenfeld \u00a312.99) each of which, at about 150 pages, suggest that the shorter book is making a comeback. In the world of books, two almost makes a trend, and if this turns out to be the case, it's quite a startling development. </p> <p>The idea that a little book can be important is shocking to some people. Brevity rhymes with levity. Little books are seen as somehow not serious. Literature, on the other hand, reaches us in long books. And length implies gravity, as William Henry, first Duke of Gloucester, acknowledged when, upon receiving Edward Gibbon's latest, he notoriously exclaimed 'Another damned, thick, square book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble! Eh, Mr Gibbon?' (This remark is also attributed to George III.) </p> <p>Pace the Hanoverians, we are brought up to believe that reading should be a wholly absorbing process of intellectual engagement with a complex and substantial text - War and Peace, for example, or Bleak House.

In the world of books, two almost makes a trend, and if this turns out to be the case, it's quite a startling development. The idea that a little book can be important is shocking to some people. Brevity rhymes with levity. Little books are seen as somehow not serious. Literature, on the other hand, reaches us in long books. And length implies gravity, as William Henry, first Duke of Gloucester, acknowledged when, upon receiving Edward Gibbon's latest, he notoriously exclaimed 'Another damned, thick, square book! Always scribble, scribble, scribble! Eh, Mr Gibbon?' (This remark is also attributed to George III.) Pace the Hanoverians, we are brought up to believe that reading should be a wholly absorbing process of intellectual engagement with a complex and substantial text - War and Peace, for example, or Bleak House. Both of these titles fall within the realist tradition whose shadow still falls over many of the books released today. Realism and length go hand in hand. 'Realism,' wrote Albert Camus in The Rebel, 'is indefinite enumeration.'

He has left us a body of work that in its freedom, daring and unflagging excitement has no parallel. He is the peak of the Venetian renaissance, the greatest colourist in the history of Western art. Even a formal catalogue of his complete paintings like this can hardly fail to give the dangerous thrilling promise of a box of fireworks. </p> <p>The magic of Titian is in his marriage of rich sensuous appeal with the most elevated philosophical symbolism. The observer can immediately fall in love with the characteristic velvety surface, the astonishing absorption in the effects of colour. Close your eyes and think of the National Gallery's Bacchus and Ariadne, and what comes to mind is the unforgettable leaping God and the most intense blue sky a painter ever imagined; the late mythologies leave an enduring impression of russety browns and greens, as clear as Rothko. </p> <p>But Titian's painterly genius is only the half of it, and a slower examination of the paintings will reveal a man who talked with the poets and the philosophers of his age on an equal footing. Often, a mythology or a portrait will reveal a deep interest in neo-Platonic imagery. The late Venus Blindfolding Cupid in the Galleria Borghese, for instance, may be an allegory of the neo-Platonic idea of earthly and divine love, and certainly a subject that was devised by the painter for the benefit of a learned patron. Some of these subjects have now become obscure, and scholars are always arguing about the exact meaning of the Flaying of Marsyas; but they were never meant to be clear, and were always painted for the benefit of a rarefied and scholarly group of philosopher-kings. </p> <p>What the paintings reveal is a painter of the utmost originality and curiosity. Most painters, even the greatest such as Raphael, are content to work within the subjects and manner of their predecessors. Titian was not, and his subjects, such as the mythologies on Ovid, are as likely to be inspired by his reading and thought; his practice in painting derives from experimentation in the studio and is without precedent. He transformed the art and is always looking forward rather than backwards; the Interrupted Concert is startlingly reminiscent of a Caravaggio, and Velazquez became what he was by long thought about the sublime Titians of Philip II. </p> <p>Of course there are things which Titian took from his contemporaries; the impact on him of Roman mannerism in the 1540s has been much examined, and perhaps overstated. But he showed a marvellous ability to take without direct imitation, and when the posture of a Titian Venus may be demonstrated to derive from one of Michelangelo's figures of Day and Night, it strikes one as a shock, so completely has Titian succeeded in making it his own. Perhaps the greatest tribute to the riches of Titian's art is that he proved, for Veronese or Tintoretto, one of those models in which quite unsuspected qualities, the opposite of what we normally mean by Titianesque, may be found. Like Rembrandt, he encouraged greatness and not just imitation. </p> <p>The characteristic texture of a mature Titian - what Filippo Pedrocco aptly calls a 'smoky, magma-like impasto' - was produced by an extraordinarily intricate technique. We have a thorough account of his working methods from Palma Giovane, as recorded by Marco Boschini; a broad sketching of the principal figures in raw colours, and then the canvas was abandoned for a few months for consideration, before reshaping in solid layers of paint.</p> <p>The final surface was produced, according to Palma, 'more with his fingers than with his brush'. What remains reveals, as well as conceals, its rich depths; the characteristic texture of a Titian, particularly in his later phase, is of highlights scudding over a deep, complex series of layers, shadows and light. He worked quickly when it was necessary - the great frescoes for the Scuola del Santo in Padua were done in just 23 days - but for the most part his paintings were the product of deep thought and contemplation. </p> <p>It is surprising, given Titian's place in European art, that no proper catalogue has recently been produced of his paintings, and this is something anyone with an interest in painting will want to have. A slightly dry, but accurate and informative essay is followed by the paintings, and each is given an admirable and enlightening commentary. Titian's masterpieces are the mythologies, and particularly the mythological subjects he produced late in life for Philip II of Spain, from which all great Spanish painting stems. </p> <p>What is particularly pleasing is the serious consideration of the marvellous series of portraits, which are viewed in exactly the same way, as symbolic statements; there are always fewer props, but Pedroccio confirms what one always instinctively felt, that in the Man with a Glove there is a philosophical statement to match anything in Titian's more crowded and elaborate works. Admirable, too, is the patient explanation of why Titian's religious paintings and altarpieces represent so very radical a break with the past, and it is important to be taken through their innovations in space, colour and design by a scrupulous guide. </p> <p>Titian is always beautiful and perhaps the great benefit of this solid guide through his work is that it takes that largely for granted and reminds us that he is also difficult and was utterly revolutionary.</p>",

In a meeting with the Governor, Olry, the rebel leader Atai acted out a graphic explanation of his people's grievances. He carried with him two sacks, the contents of which he emptied at the Frenchman's feet. The first contained soil. 'This,' said Atai, 'is what we had before you came.' The second contained pebbles. 'And this is what we have now.' By June of 1878 Atai's rebellion was over after a slash and burn policy had reduced hundreds of Kanak villages to ash.

In a policy developed first in Algeria, the French replaced potentially troublesome local chiefs with pliant placemen loyal to the new regime. Within two years the French had thrown the Kanaks off 90 per cent of the best land and destroyed the tribal culture.

The first is a political history of the droughts and famine that killed millions in the colonial world just as it was being wiped out in western Europe. The second is the scientific history of the phenomenon that became known as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (Enso): the cyclical pattern of extreme weather conditions that created the droughts in the first place. This part of the book celebrates the work of scientists, culminating in that of Jacob Bjerknes of University of California, Los Angeles, in the 1960s who studied the inner workings of El Ni\u00f1o, the rapid warming of the tropical Pacific that leads to drought, and its equally deadly twin La Ni\u00f1a, which causes torrential rain and flooding </p> <p>Davis draws together these meteorological and social phenomena to produce a picture of what he calls 'the malign interaction between climactic and economic processes'. </p> <p>Between 1876 and 1902 as many as 60 million people died as a result of famines in India, China and Brazil.

After reading this, I defy even the most ardent nationalist to feel proud of the so-called 'achievements' of empire.",

Also at the party is another newcomer, Cara, a drop-dead gorgeous femme fatale and consummate games player.

Ben eventually concurs, after events in his personal life give him good reason to; and besides, a three-week luxury holiday in Kenya, with pneumatic love interest, seems a small price to pay for having a sensor sewn into the back of his head.

Macdonald does a fine job with his plot, though it occasionally flirts with over-contrivance and the characters are developed no further than is necessary for their functions. The shocks he establishes, and the gradual harrowing of his protagonist, do make for a genuinely compulsive read. As a thriller, The Mind Game should more than satisfy fans of the genre. </p> <p>Whether greater claims can be made for The Mind Game, as its publicists maintain, is less certain. The book, and the marketing surrounding it, inevitably makes much of the fact that its author is a former student of Richard Dawkins - to whom he gives credit within the story. Macdonald explains that 'to keep the book entertaining to non-scientific readers, I have simplified, omitted and selectively amplified', and there's nothing wrong with that, but there is nothing here that would require a university degree from either author or reader. </p> <p>Neurophysiology and genetic research are two of the most exciting fields in science, and will have profound social impacts.

Three years ago, with Underworld, Don DeLillo exploded the scope of the contemporary novel. He proved that it could fuse historical stringency with Cold War paranoia; could provide an arena for our techno-dreams and urban myths. His book was an 827-page manifesto for the connexity and sweep of the late twentieth-century imagination, and, as Martin Amis observed in the New York Times, his voice 'suddenly filled the sky'. </p> <p>He has followed that mushroom cloud of literary energy with something small and, by comparison, very nearly mute. The Body Artist feels like a wilful contraction of DeLillo's powers, a self-conscious rebooting of his sensory memory, almost an aftershock of humility. It returns this most daring of writers to first principles: how to construct sentences that properly describe the world; how to build a syntax adequate to extremes of emotion. If Underworld required the reader to think of Joyce, The Body Artist brings to mind, in the wariness of its prose, Beckett. Having spent most of his writing life revealing what of the present moment language might nail down, DeLillo here examines the substance of experience it can only grope towards. </p> <p>He achieves this through the semi-detached voice of Lauren Hartke, a performance artist. The book opens with her making breakfast for her husband, a film director. The couple have rented an old house near the coast for six months, and everything has a new-lit, scoured quality. Lauren watches birds on the bird table, tries to get her mind to articulate their movements, and fails: '[they] broke off the feeder in a wing-whirr that was all b's and r's, the letter b followed by a series of vibrato r's. But that wasn't it at all. That wasn't anything like it...' </p> <p>She finds unlikely intensity in simple domestic ritual: little haiku in the rinsing of blueberries under the cold tap or in watching her husband light his morning cigarette. She feels herself 'hyper-prepared, or haywire, or hair-trigger' as the detail of her life crowds in, threatens to overwhelm her. Instinct suddenly requires prompts: 'she took a bite of cereal and forgot to taste it', she observes of herself, third person; or, 'she remembered to smile'. As she reads the newspaper she drifts in and out of the distant lives it reports. </p> <p>In some senses, all of this is by way of preparation. Though she does not know it as they routinely bicker over news and cereals, this will be the last morning Lauren will spend with her husband. After breakfast he drives to his ex-wife's apartment in Manhattan and shoots himself in the head. The remainder of the novel is concerned with Lauren's attempts to inhabit her sense of being 'sexually and abysmally alone'. </p> <p>DeLillo's characters have often been super-sensitive to the aura and nuance of everyday objects, the strangeness of them. Here, he rounds on that quality, makes it his subject. After her husband's death Lauren needs to reconstruct her life into a narrative, but it refuses cause and effect. Driving, she finds herself in that state where 'all the cars including yours seem to flow in dissociated motion... and the highway runs in a white hum'. For her art and for her sanity she commits herself to the 'gyrate exaggerations, the snake shapes and flower bends' of yoga; she relearns how to breathe; she cuts her hair and sheds her skin, obsessively exfoliating and scraping and pumicing, making herself raw to the world. </p> <p>The author returns - a persistent theme - to the dehumanising effects of technology, the ways in which reality is diminished by electronic mediation. Lauren, clinging to a sense of what is human, becomes intrigued, here, for example, by the automated voice on an answering machine message 'one male voice in seven different time cycles. But not male exactly either...' She finds a metaphor for her loneliness on the internet, a fixed camera on a Finnish street in the middle of the night and watches 'cars entering and leaving Kotka, or just the empty road in the dead times.' She imagines - pure DeLillo - 'that someone might masturbate to this'. </p> <p>In this state, ascetic and delusional, she becomes fascinated with, and unsure of, the boundaries of the self. The author has been criticised in the past for not creating 'rounded' characters though the precise point of his characterisation has often been to show an individual - Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra is the prime example - not as a fixed point but a series of desperate and dissolving gestures. The Body Artist takes that idea to its logical extreme: by the end of the book, in performance, Lauren achieves literal shape-shifting, becoming, briefly on stage, someone entirely other. </p> <p>This process begins in earnest when, convinced that there is someone else in the old house, she walks into a little-used room one day to find a boy seated on the bed. She is unsure if he is a ghost, or a 'foundling', or an externalised embodiment of her loss, but he speaks in a voice uncannily like that of her late husband. At the heart of the novel are Lauren's conversations with the boy, which she tapes, and interrogates, a kind of fragmentary pillow talk from beyond the grave, or from back in time, or an inspired act of mimicry. The boy, is an 'as if', he exists only in relation to other references, and in him time has slowed to a full stop. </p> <p>DeLillo enjoys the possibilities of this suspension of reality. 'The world is full of abandoned meanings,' he wrote in White Noise; 'Believe everything,' says a a character in Underworld, 'Everything is true.' Here he focuses that sense on the personal and the intimate, brings it to bear on the strained moments in which selfhood might slip through our fingers. In doing so, he fumbles for something archetypal - Cathy Earnshaw or Tennyson's Mariana in her moated grange are not far from Lauren as she listens to her unreachable house guest 'shadow-inching through a sentence, showing a word in its facets and aspects, words like moons in particular phases'. </p> <p>'I write to find out how much I know,' DeLillo is fond of saying, in his rare interviews. 'The act of writing for me is a concentrated form of thought.' This is a book, more than any of his previous work, that confronts how much he doesn't know, and the ways in which concentrated forms of thought might let you down. The result is a novel that is both slight and profound, a distilled meditation on perception and loss, and a poised, individual ghost story for the twenty-first century. </p> <p><strong> DeLillo: the facts</strong></p> <p> <strong> Born</strong> 20 November 1936, New York </p> <p><strong> Novels </strong> Americana (1971) The Names (1982) White Noise (1985) Libra (1988) Mao II (1991) Underworld (1997) </p> <p><strong> DeLillo on his work </strong> 'Silence, exile, cunning...

As if in comment, the third novel here is a lyrical multi-generational saga of European settlers in Israel. </p> <p>The title of John Wray's <strong> The Right Hand of Sleep </strong> comes from a poem whose last lines are 'Coming home to you fills me/ With a vast sickness', and this is pretty much what the hero, Voxlauer, feels on coming back to his homeland, as the townspeople he grew up with begin to heil Hitler and desecrate the property of the Jewish family in town - the Ryslavys - one of whom happens to be his best friend. </p> <p>The opening chapters have the excitement of discovering that Voxlauer is an emblem of twentieth-century history: he deserted from the First World War after being forced to shoot an Awol soldier, and made his way to Russia. A traumatised teenager, he was taken in by a woman relieved to be rid of her battering husband; after she and Voxlauer become lovers, she tells him they are married, and they develop a playful, happy partnership.</p> <p>They believe in the socialist ideal but, like so many, they are destroyed by Stalinism. Voxlauer spends years in a labour camp. When his partner dies, broken by collective farming, he returns to Austria. He takes a job as gamekeeper on the Ryslavys' land, and despite the isolation of the property, meets a beautiful, sensitive, highly intelligent woman with a mysterious past; this makes for a more conventionally suspenseful plot when her cousin, a Nazi officer, arrives to run the town. </p> <p>Like Ian McEwan's Black Dogs, The Right Hand of Sleep lays out the past century's dilemma in terms of politics versus the personal, but ultimately as a matter of happenstance rather than choice. The characters do not divide over whether the interior or exterior is the way to a better life, but, more prosaically, over whether it's OK to destroy people for a cause. Politics, in other words, is what gets in the way of our personal lives. </p> <p>The book always suggests more than it states, and is at its best in the friendly insults that Ryslavy and Voxlauer exchange, in the feeling for countryside and homegrown food, and in the delicately calibrated emotional temperature of the relationships. Most of all, there is the tone, which hums along somewhere between resignation and resolution; Wray is also a poet, and it shows. </p> <p>Like Wray, Rosina Lippi is an American who has spent time in rural Austria; she gives us the local, untravelled, minimally educated farm folk unsymbolically, for themselves. The 12 linked stories of <strong> Homestead</strong>, set in the fictional village of Rosenau, get immediately under the skin and pack as much punch as 12 novels, diving into the characters' most wrenching moments between 1909 and 1977. </p> <p>The villagers are not untouched by two world wars, even though they still take their cows to upland meadows for the summer, make cheese, and know everyone's business and little of the outside world. Another First World War deserter comes into it: an Italian soldier who takes refuge with a hardworking farm woman. She has been spurned by all the local men because of her limp; he sees her value. Of course it is too dangerous, after they become lovers, for him to stay. </p> <p>Lippi's language is as direct and elemental as the world it describes. What is extraordinary is the way it so factually evokes the wistfulness, inner corrosion, or immense tenderness of lives that are both circumscribed and rich, mundane but, over the long haul, deep in drama. You get the anthropological pleasures of literary tourism, from a sense of the high mountains in a town that is like 'living at the bottom of a bowl' to the details of how to make rennet (this involves vinegar, calves' stomachs and praying to saints). You begin to feel that you yourself are one of the people of Rosenau. </p> <p>I expected to feel like one of the people in Nomi Eve's <strong> The Family Orchid</strong> - descendants of Russian Jews who have emigrated to Israel and, in the last generation, America; real people based on the author's family. Realism, however, is not her thing; this is a work of magic realism, the mysticism of nineteenth-century Hassidic tales wed to 1970s Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and set in Israel. The book goes from Jerusalem in 1837 - where the happily married Esther carries on a lifelong affair with a baker which, to her husband's consternation, both pleases and excites him - to the present, including the author's own idealised courtship by her eventual husband. </p> <p>In The Family Orchard, tree-grafting, sewing and local legends all have the power of spells. This makes courtly fairytales out of lives that, viewed more objectively, might be hard or prosaic. This could not be more of a contrast with Linda Grant's sober, Orange Prize-winning When I Lived in Modern Times. Eve shows us mainly the joyous side of Jewish life, its sensual acceptance and earthiness. Like the villagers of Rosenau, and unlike Voxlauer and company, these Israelis are neither alienated nor ironic. It is good to encounter this American view, but in The Family Orchard, it is wedded to a sensibility that some may find a little too whimsical and self-loving.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I lay myself open to two charges when I say that the asylum 'debate' is the most shameful example of political and journalistic lying I have heard in 20 years as a reporter. The first, that I sound like a sententious saloon-bar berk, is unduckable and must be taken on the chin. The second is encapsulated by the rejoinder: what about the competition? It's ferocious, I grant you. But the merits of rival claimants cannot trump the pretence that we treat refugees decently. Since the early Nineties, grateful New Labour and Conservative politicians have been allowed to - encouraged to, in fact - get away with transparent falsehoods by media inspired by hatred of strangers (the far-Right press) and a credulous trust in authority (the BBC and ITN).</p> <p>Last Sunday, Tony Blair and Giuliano Amato wrote in these pages of their detestation of 'the horrors illegal immigrants endure at the hands of the people traffickers' and promised, 'in all that we do, we will honour our obligation to provide protection to those fleeing persecution'.</p> <p>It was an old, big lie, which was polished by Jack Straw at the European Union justice ministers conference in Stockholm on Thursday when he posed as a tough yet tender statesperson who wanted to be 'generous toward genuine refugees' while taking a 'tougher line' against economic migrants.</p> <p>In a Westminster world where words have been yanked from their moorings to meaning, comprehension comes when you grasp that the truth is invariably the exact opposite of what is said. The leaders of the European Union have created people-trafficking gangs as surely as prohibition created bootleggers. Blair and Straw are doing everything they can to stop 'genuine refugees' finding sanctuary. As for economic migrants, we love them for their labour and taxes.</p> <p>The 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees allows the victims of political oppression to claim shelter in safe countries. Britain has been subverting its enlightened principles for years. Whenever conflicts begin, the Home Office imposes visa restrictions on the suffering countries. The persecuted who are running from Saddam Hussein or the Taliban cannot travel to Britain legally unless they have a visa.</p> <p>But, and here is where the Home Office shows its slyness, we don't give visas to those who say they want asylum or are suspected by embassies of thinking of claiming asylum. As a result, authentic refugees can be slandered as 'illegal immigrants' when they arrive at Dover.</p> <p>To make sure they get the message, Britain and her European allies fine the owners of planes, trains, ships, cars and lorries if they carry passengers who don't have visas. Last week the last breach in the walls was plugged when France agreed to allow British immigration officers on to the Eurostar. The various News at Tens reported the restrictions as a blow against illegal immigrants without explaining why the aliens were illegal or noting that genuine victims of persecution were among their number. I suppose I've no right to be shocked after all these years.</p> <p>Desperate people take desperate measures. For want of legal means of travel, refugees have turned to smugglers and visa forgers whose businesses have been boosted by Blair and his colleagues. Not everything is going the gangsters' way. Britain now receives the greatest number of asylum applications in Europe because the far greater flow of millions from the former Yugoslavia, most of whom went to Germany, has been stemmed by the Kosovo campaign (for which the PM can take credit) and the fall of Milosevic.</p> <p>The keepers of Fortress Europe remain frustrated, however, and plan to get rougher still. The French are proposing that carriers who allow undocumented refugees to travel should be fined and then made to return them to the point of embarkation. Straw, meanwhile, is demanding mass expulsions.</p> <p>His hope that refugees seeking a home in Europe could be forced to live in camps in the Third World, while interior ministries decide whether they would accept them, puzzled observers. Why on earth would dirt-poor countries, which already have to look after the majority of the world's refugees, cooperate?</p> <p>The short answer is that they will be bullied and bribed into compliance. Last year the European Union signed a new Lom\u00e9 convention with the nations of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. They were compelled to accept the repatriation of people 'illegally present' in Europe - as asylum seekers tend to be - or lose \u00a38.5 billion in aid and trade. The victims of the world's greatest crimes will either be sent back to face their local police chiefs or confined behind wire in neighbouring states. (The EU has told the Turks that it will finance the building of internment camps for refugees who come into their territory and promised the persecutors of the Kurds that the jails would not be troubled by UN inspectors.)</p> <p>Straw will soon be free to engage in gesture politics. If a celebrity reporter finds a wounded girl with a cute face in the next Sarajevo, I'm sure she will be rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital. If the cameras aren't there, I suspect compassion will evaporate. When you put their cruelties to the political class, you are often treated to a bluff lecture on pragmatism. We agree with much of what you say, you're told, but live in the real world, son. There's only so much immigration society can take. We're civilised people, but you should see our swinish voters. If we aren't mean, there will be a racist backlash.</p> <p>The force of this argument is blunted by the generally tolerant welcome asylum seekers receive in British cities - despite the hard work of the Daily Mail, there's been nothing to compare with the fire-bombings of hostels in Germany. It is refuted by the desire of European Union governments to allow mass immigration.</p> <p>The baby-boomers who are now in power have, somewhat carelessly, failed to produce enough sprogs to generate the wealth which might pay for their pensions. As this is a generation unused to privation, something must be done. Barbara Roche, the immigration Minister, who rants at gypsy mothers and presides over a system of relief which has brought asylum seekers to the edge of starvation, is therefore singing the positive virtues of economic migration.</p> <p>With an ageing and declining population, Britain requires doctors, computer programmers and engineers as well as skivvies and navvies to do the dirty work. A Home Office report released last month said that about 150,000 immigrants from outside the EU will be needed every year for 20 years if the economic show is to be kept on the road. Roche was not reviled by the press. Even the Mail praised her. Prejudice must never threaten profits.</p> <p>Everyone in power can empathise with people who move to make money. What they find intolerable and incomprehensible are those who run for their lives because they have made a stand on -- of all things! - political principle.</p> <p><b> Livin' La Vida Loca with Big Willie Hague</b></p> <p>Men don't come harder than Big Willie Hague. He's a fighting, drinking Cock of the North who can have you any day, with one hand behind his back.</p> <p>But you must not go thinking that he doesn't experience spiritual moments. When he contemplates the big questions - What are we here for? Where is God? Why Archie Norman? - he turns to his pastor, Tim Montgomerie, the director of the Conservative Christian Fellowship.</p> <p>Montgomerie's place at the right hand of Willie surprised many Tories. When he was elected leader, Hague had no noticeable religious convictions and boasted of his support for gay marriages, Notting Hill Carnivals, single mothers and sex before wedlock. Then he had a cool look at his activists and realised that many were in danger of being carted off to the nursing home after the next hard winter. The able-bodied minority he needed to enthuse contained a large number of God-botherers inspired by the ignorant and vicious Christian Coalition of the United States.</p> <p>Montgomerie was quickly moved into Tory Central Office from where he has been correcting heretics who misinterpret 'compassionate conservatism'. Many in Britain 'heard the Ricky Martin songs and observed the multitude of ethnic faces at last year's Republican Convention' and thought that Bush and his British disciple were 'friendly to alternative lifestyles'.</p> <p>'Compassionate conservatism,' he sternly reminds readers of the Renewing One Nation website, 'is actually the philosophical opposite of the social liberalism that attempts to enshrine indifference in legislation to forms of anti-social behaviour - eg, infidelity, minor crimes or drug abuse.'</p> <p>If liberals are indifferent to these vices, should Conservatives enshrine their detestation of anti-social behaviour in legislation? If so, is Montgomerie sure that infidelity should be included in the list of sins? Is there not a danger that Conservative MPs - God and the News of the World alone know how many - could end up in the dock?</p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,5860,334788,00.html\">Seeking asylum: who, where and why?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm\" target=\"_new\">Source document: 1951 UN convention on refugees</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The Refugee Council</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jcwi.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.ch/\" target=\"_new\">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hrweb.org/legal/undocs.html\" target=\"_new\">UN human rights declarations: including the Geneva Convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Immigration and Nationality Directorate</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldbills/091/1999091.htm\" target=\"_new\">The immigration and asylum bill</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ukpa.gov.uk/ukpass.htm\" target=\"_new\">UK passports agency</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "I lay myself open to two charges when I say that the asylum 'debate' is the most shameful example of political and journalistic lying I have heard in 20 years as a reporter. The first, that I sound like a sententious saloon-bar berk, is unduckable and must be taken on the chin. The second is encapsulated by the rejoinder: what about the competition? It's ferocious, I grant you. But the merits of rival claimants cannot trump the pretence that we treat refugees decently. Since the early Nineties, grateful New Labour and Conservative politicians have been allowed to - encouraged to, in fact - get away with transparent falsehoods by media inspired by hatred of strangers (the far-Right press) and a credulous trust in authority (the BBC and ITN). Last Sunday, Tony Blair and Giuliano Amato wrote in these pages of their detestation of 'the horrors illegal immigrants endure at the hands of the people traffickers' and promised, 'in all that we do, we will honour our obligation to provide protection to those fleeing persecution'. It was an old, big lie, which was polished by Jack Straw at the European Union justice ministers conference in Stockholm on Thursday when he posed as a tough yet tender statesperson who wanted to be 'generous toward genuine refugees' while taking a 'tougher line' against economic migrants. In a Westminster world where words have been yanked from their moorings to meaning, comprehension comes when you grasp that the truth is invariably the exact opposite of what is said. The leaders of the European Union have created people-trafficking gangs as surely as prohibition created bootleggers. Blair and Straw are doing everything they can to stop 'genuine refugees' finding sanctuary. As for economic migrants, we love them for their labour and taxes. The 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees allows the victims of political oppression to claim shelter in safe countries. Britain has been subverting its enlightened principles for years. Whenever conflicts begin, the Home Office imposes visa restrictions on the suffering countries. The persecuted who are running from Saddam Hussein or the Taliban cannot travel to Britain legally unless they have a visa. But, and here is where the Home Office shows its slyness, we don't give visas to those who say they want asylum or are suspected by embassies of thinking of claiming asylum. As a result, authentic refugees can be slandered as 'illegal immigrants' when they arrive at Dover. To make sure they get the message, Britain and her European allies fine the owners of planes, trains, ships, cars and lorries if they carry passengers who don't have visas. Last week the last breach in the walls was plugged when France agreed to allow British immigration officers on to the Eurostar. The various News at Tens reported the restrictions as a blow against illegal immigrants without explaining why the aliens were illegal or noting that genuine victims of persecution were among their number. I suppose I've no right to be shocked after all these years. Desperate people take desperate measures. For want of legal means of travel, refugees have turned to smugglers and visa forgers whose businesses have been boosted by Blair and his colleagues. Not everything is going the gangsters' way. Britain now receives the greatest number of asylum applications in Europe because the far greater flow of millions from the former Yugoslavia, most of whom went to Germany, has been stemmed by the Kosovo campaign (for which the PM can take credit) and the fall of Milosevic. The keepers of Fortress Europe remain frustrated, however, and plan to get rougher still. The French are proposing that carriers who allow undocumented refugees to travel should be fined and then made to return them to the point of embarkation. Straw, meanwhile, is demanding mass expulsions. His hope that refugees seeking a home in Europe could be forced to live in camps in the Third World, while interior ministries decide whether they would accept them, puzzled observers. Why on earth would dirt-poor countries, which already have to look after the majority of the world's refugees, cooperate? The short answer is that they will be bullied and bribed into compliance. Last year the European Union signed a new Lom\u00e9 convention with the nations of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. They were compelled to accept the repatriation of people 'illegally present' in Europe - as asylum seekers tend to be - or lose \u00a38.5 billion in aid and trade. The victims of the world's greatest crimes will either be sent back to face their local police chiefs or confined behind wire in neighbouring states. (The EU has told the Turks that it will finance the building of internment camps for refugees who come into their territory and promised the persecutors of the Kurds that the jails would not be troubled by UN inspectors.) Straw will soon be free to engage in gesture politics. If a celebrity reporter finds a wounded girl with a cute face in the next Sarajevo, I'm sure she will be rushed to Great Ormond Street Hospital. If the cameras aren't there, I suspect compassion will evaporate. When you put their cruelties to the political class, you are often treated to a bluff lecture on pragmatism. We agree with much of what you say, you're told, but live in the real world, son. There's only so much immigration society can take. We're civilised people, but you should see our swinish voters. If we aren't mean, there will be a racist backlash. The force of this argument is blunted by the generally tolerant welcome asylum seekers receive in British cities - despite the hard work of the Daily Mail, there's been nothing to compare with the fire-bombings of hostels in Germany. It is refuted by the desire of European Union governments to allow mass immigration. The baby-boomers who are now in power have, somewhat carelessly, failed to produce enough sprogs to generate the wealth which might pay for their pensions. As this is a generation unused to privation, something must be done. Barbara Roche, the immigration Minister, who rants at gypsy mothers and presides over a system of relief which has brought asylum seekers to the edge of starvation, is therefore singing the positive virtues of economic migration. With an ageing and declining population, Britain requires doctors, computer programmers and engineers as well as skivvies and navvies to do the dirty work. A Home Office report released last month said that about 150,000 immigrants from outside the EU will be needed every year for 20 years if the economic show is to be kept on the road. Roche was not reviled by the press. Even the Mail praised her. Prejudice must never threaten profits. Everyone in power can empathise with people who move to make money. What they find intolerable and incomprehensible are those who run for their lives because they have made a stand on -- of all things! - political principle. Livin' La Vida Loca with Big Willie Hague Men don't come harder than Big Willie Hague. He's a fighting, drinking Cock of the North who can have you any day, with one hand behind his back. But you must not go thinking that he doesn't experience spiritual moments. When he contemplates the big questions - What are we here for? Where is God? Why Archie Norman? - he turns to his pastor, Tim Montgomerie, the director of the Conservative Christian Fellowship. Montgomerie's place at the right hand of Willie surprised many Tories. When he was elected leader, Hague had no noticeable religious convictions and boasted of his support for gay marriages, Notting Hill Carnivals, single mothers and sex before wedlock. Then he had a cool look at his activists and realised that many were in danger of being carted off to the nursing home after the next hard winter. The able-bodied minority he needed to enthuse contained a large number of God-botherers inspired by the ignorant and vicious Christian Coalition of the United States. Montgomerie was quickly moved into Tory Central Office from where he has been correcting heretics who misinterpret 'compassionate conservatism'. Many in Britain 'heard the Ricky Martin songs and observed the multitude of ethnic faces at last year's Republican Convention' and thought that Bush and his British disciple were 'friendly to alternative lifestyles'. 'Compassionate conservatism,' he sternly reminds readers of the Renewing One Nation website, 'is actually the philosophical opposite of the social liberalism that attempts to enshrine indifference in legislation to forms of anti-social behaviour - eg, infidelity, minor crimes or drug abuse.' If liberals are indifferent to these vices, should Conservatives enshrine their detestation of anti-social behaviour in legislation? If so, is Montgomerie sure that infidelity should be included in the list of sins? Is there not a danger that Conservative MPs - God and the News of the World alone know how many - could end up in the dock? Interactive guide Seeking asylum: who, where and why?

      "body": "<p>Simon Laffin is finance director of the Safeway supermarket group. You might expect him to start his day by leaving his executive saloon in his company parking space and walking along a carpeted corridor to his spacious, private office. </p> <p>But for three months at the end of last year it was nothing like that. On a bad day, it took Laffin half an-hour to walk the 60ft to his desk. By the time he got there, he could have sorted out everything from finding a replacement for a member of staff who had gone off sick, a repair to a key piece of equipment, or dealt with a couple of customer complaints.This was because Laffin had gone 'back to the floor' for real, running one of the group's stores. </p> <p>As finance director, the issues he has to deal with are crucial to the company - how should its borrowings be structured, what impact will its promotional campaign have on profits. But they are problems that are soluble and Laffin had the time to solve them. </p> <p>In store, it was different. A woman who could spend more than \u00a35,000 a year at the store had hit her car on a kerb in the car park and wanted Laffin to foot the bill for repairs; a bomb scare at a neighbouring premises meant stock could not be delivered; the in-store bakery could not make bread because a huge delivery of promotional goods was blocking the path to supplies. All those issues had to be dealt with immediately but there was no easy solution. </p> <p>'Everyone at the top thinks they know how their business works, but 99 per cent of them are kidding themselves,' says Laffin. </p> <p>Other British bosses, including Sir Neville Sims of the Carillion construction company, John Coleman of House of Fraser and Bob Baty of South West Water, have also been going back to the floor, courtesy of a BBC television series by the same name. </p> <p>In that programme, the bosses spend a week at the sharp end of their business, accompanied by cameras. Some have found it a salutary experience - Luke Johnson of the Belgo chain stormed out, telling the camera man to 'stick your programme'; Dino Adriano made major changes to the Sainsbury check-out system after he spent a stint on the tills. The producers usually also tried to throw at least one spanner in the works for the boss to deal with, their response caught by the unforgiving eye of the camera. </p> <p>But they were only there for a week. Laffin's experience was different and not just because it is longer: his performance would affect the company's profits. His sales were monitored daily, his profits weekly; if he fouled up it would have been spotted quickly, and that would hardly be good for the reputation of a main board director. </p> <p>However, back to the floor is the wrong phrase. Laffin had never worked in a supermarket before and neither had most of the group's senior managers. The exception is Carlos Criado-Perez, Safeway's chief executive, who worked his way through a number of European food retailers, ending up at US giant Wal-Mart before taking on the Safeway job in 1999. The lack of hand's-on experience of other senior managers prompted him to start the programme of sending executives out to run stores. Laffin was the second to go and it is likely that others will follow. </p> <p>Laffin has found the experience invaluable. He sums up the key benefit as altering his perception. 'When you watch the Back To The Floor programmes they always learn a lot. But some also begin to see the world through different eyes. I do now have a completely different perception of the business. The world really does look different in a store than it does in a boardroom.' </p> <p>For a start, there is the communication problem. The board may decide what it wants to tell staff in the stores, but what is actually communicated to them may lose a lot in the translation. 'What matters is not what you say, but what people hear you say.' </p> <p>At head office, Laffin thinks he suffers from constant interruptions. In store, however, he said ' I never had 10 minutes uninterrupted'. He may tell his office staff that he does not want any interruptions but, in a store, that was impossible. 'I could be dealing with some delicate problem and someone would burst into my office and say \"Bloggs has been rude to me, what are you going to do about it?\".' </p> <p>Laffin was give six weeks of training - three weeks shadowing the manager in another store, two accompanying an area manager on his visits to his stores and a further week back in the store. Safeway's real store managers, by contrast, are likely to have spent their careers in a store, doing all the different jobs. </p> <p>Laffin admits that his store staff probably knew a lot more than him about how it operates. </p> <p>The store, in Wokingham, Berkshire, is not one of the largest in the group. 'It is not a flagship,' said Laffin. 'If you wanted someone to drive your car, what would you give him - a Ferrari or a Ford Mondeo? I know my limitations. It was more important that I do we.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, he managed to improve its performance: sales growth is 3 per cent higher than it was and profits increased by more than that. Laffin admits he was lucky: the store he was running was his local, which he had been using for 16 years before he started at Safeway, so he knew the changes he would like to see as a customer. They were pretty simple. </p> <p>He increased the number of promotions in the store. Safeway's strategy, since Criado-Perez took over, has been to make big cuts in the price of around 20 basic items, changing every week and varying from store to store. Research has shown that Safeway's customers love them and are irritated when the store runs out of stock. So Laffin increased the number of items on offer each week, and gave them greater prominence in the store. </p> <p>Laffin's key lesson for the future is that, before any changes to the way stores operate is imposed by the centre, a serving store manager must be involved in the decision. Only he or she will be able to assess the impact the changes will have on them and their time. </p> <p>And he would recommend that other companies do similar exercises - except for his rivals. He would not want them to benefit from the lessons he has learned.</p>",
