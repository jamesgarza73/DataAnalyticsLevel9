The decoration takes place at Saree Mandir, a vast Indian clothes shop that would be an essential stopping-off point on a British spice trail.</p> <p>No official trail exists, but, like other Midland and northern cities, Leicester has grasped the tourist potential of multiculturalism. Its shops, temples and museums, after all, offer visitors an exotic taste of Asia without the need to travel half way round the world. </p> <p>The city houses major communities of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Jains, as well as Africans, Chinese, and people whose roots are in the Caribbean. It boasts that whenever you visit, someone will probably be celebrating something. </p> <p>The focal point of the Asian community is Belgrave Road: busy, urban, and lined with streets of brick terraces. It is known as the Golden Mile because more gold jewellery is reputedly sold across the counter here than anywhere else in Europe. </p> <p>The road comes into its own during the Hindu autumn festival of Diwali, when its display of 6,000 lights - tiny oil lamps, candles or electric bulbs - is said to be the biggest outside India. </p> <p>Khandelwal's warehouse-sized Saree Mandir - it means temple of saris - was one of the road's first Asian shops. It opened before Catholic churches, such as Our Lady's in Moira Street, started being converted into Hindu temples, with the Stations of the Cross replaced by statues of the deities Rama and Krishna. </p> <p>'When I came over from Delhi in 1963, I realised there was no one in the whole of Leicester selling saris,' says Khandelwal. 'Now I have customers coming from all over the country - from Newcastle, from Gravesend, every where - to buy everything from one sari to 100.' </p> <p>The saris, a kaleidoscope of patterns and colours, cost from \u00a32.50, in plain green polyester, to \u00a31,095, in exquisite pink tissue silk with gold embroidery and a strong implication of handle with care. </p> <p>'When I first started, my customers were all English ladies who had never seen saris or all these colours,' he says. 'They were very, very interested by it all.' </p> <p>Sital Raja tells a similar story of Western interest in the East in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where she runs the House of Raja's, one of Britain's biggest Asian department stores. It pulls in coach parties from all over Britain for its curry tastings and cookery and henna-painting demonstrations. </p> <p>'A lot of people who come here have never been in an Asian shop before,' says Raja. 'When we started advertising to the Western community, people said, \"We've known about you for years, but we thought we weren't allowed in because we were white.\" </p> <p>'Then they heard me with my Bolton accent, and said: \"Oh, you're more English than I am!\"' </p> <p>The store, The Little India of the North, opened 20 years ago in the former Fletcher Street Methodist Church, a sober-looking nineteenth-century building next to a drive-though McDonald's. It has the atmosphere - and the sweetly pungent spice-laden smell - of an Asian bazaar, with bangles by the yard, rice by the sackful and Bollywood film music pulsating over the public address system. </p> <p>Raja's husband Pravin (they had 1,400 guests at their wedding) sits at the check-out and runs through a gazetteer of stock: cardamom from Guatemala, cloves from Madagascar, mung beans from Australia, saffron from Spain, green lentils from Canada, peppercorns from Brazil, pickles and chutneys from Bolton, made on the premises. </p> <p>The coach parties sample the food during regular Asian evenings that climax with a version of the Generation Game in which visitors are taught the finer points of putting on saris. </p> <p>'It's generally the men who want to try it out most,' says Sital Raja, whose parents migrated from Kenya when she was three. 'But most people who buy saris wear them as sarongs or use them as curtains or tablecloths.' </p> <p>Across the Pennines, Bradford promotes itself as 'the curry capital of Britain' on the strength of its 300 Asian restaurants, mostly run by Pakistanis. </p> <p>There are restaurants in converted Presbyterian chapels, restaurants that serve nans as big as duvets, restaurants that have opened branches in Majorca to 'recreate the authentic flavours of a Yorkshire-made curry'. The city even runs its own curry website. </p> <p>The city's major Asian event is the annual Mela, a huge cultural festival that attracts crowds of 100,000 and is reckoned to be one reason why Bradford is likely to be shortlisted as Britain's next European Capital of Culture. </p> <p><strong> Back in Leicester, Europe's only Jain Centre </strong> features mirror mosaics and 250 tons of intricate, hand-carved sandstone pillars that bring a uniquely Indian atmosphere to a former Congregational chapel. </p> <p>A 10-minute walk away, and boasting the resonant address 9 Holy Bones, is the Guru Nanak Sikh Museum, a former hosiery factory where visitors, with their shoes left at the door and heads covered, can trace the history of Sikhism through photographs, documents and detailed models of South Asia's major temples. </p> <p>Down in the open market, Dev Persaud's stall is piled high with vegetables whose knobbly, multi-coloured exoticism makes tomatoes and cucumbers look sadly mundane. As he serves his customers, he gives a running commentary: 'These are tindola - like crunchy cucumber, put them in stir fries and salads. And these are Indian onions, sweeter and softer than ordinary ones; and this is karela , very good for dia betes. There's such an appetite for these things,' he says.

The area's multiculturalism is reflected in its supermarkets, where Indian paneer (curd cheese) is stacked next to Red Leicester, and Choose Your Baby's Name books cover all options: Eladevi, Elizabeth, Emily, Eshtalakshmi, Evelyn. And the Sharmilee restaurant, over a shop selling pink and green Asian sweets, wryly includes English dishes in its menu descriptions, such as, 'Fries: fried potato chips served with tomato ketchup'.

      "body": "<p>Problem: where to go for a five-day winter break in the sun to revive the spirits before the first daffodils appear and the groundsmen start to crank up their lawnmowers for the new cricket season. </p> <p>Long-haul flights are out. The Caribbean is too far, northern Europe too cold, the Canaries too packaged. </p> <p>The answer is to head south, like the birds. About two-and-a-half hours' flying time away are the open roads and mountains of Andalucia, alive with wild flowers, and the hidden ranches of Arcos de la Frontera, La Bobadilla or Aznacazar, near Seville, provide an early spring adventure. </p> <p>But another hour's flying takes you to Morocco, and another world. While the Moors played away in Andalucia, home was Marrakesh, Fez or Tangier. Forget Casablanca: its romance faded with the departure of the last DC3. The airport no longer bears the name Casablanca, but the obligatory Aeroport Mahomet V. Last time I flew there we stopped in Gibraltar, but only for the time it took to unload my luggage - so I arrived in Casablanca with no clothes. Of all the towns in all the world... </p> <p>This time was different. A brief stopover and on to the pale terracotta city of Marrakesh. Not to La Mamounia or the city's other hotels but 15 minutes away, to a sublime oasis of calm. </p> <p>Amanjena, the latest of the Aman resorts, opened just over a year ago. I discovered it in the travel guide Nota Bene, a valuable find among the bewildering plethora of travel brochures. It promised a lot, and Amanjena exceeded even those expectations. </p> <p>The place is spacious and serene on an imperial scale: in daylight the palatial buildings can resemble a dusky pink mausoleum, windowless and imposing, but behind the walls all is space, water and light. Open courtyards, cloisters, green-tiled roofs and waterways are glimpsed through Moroccan arches and columns created by Ameri can architect Ed Tuttle. This is Morocco, California-style. </p> <p>Picked up from the airport in one of the hotel's Volvos, we arrived in time for dinner, when Amanjena is at its romantic best. You step through the gate into a kind of Moroccan Taj Mahal: lanterns and candles, placed around vast pools and narrow canals, cast shimmering reflections across the water and throw the arches and cloisters into relief. Around the 60 sq metre central basin you can make out the 'pavilions' and 'maisons' that make up the hotel's 40 rooms. </p> <p>The pavilions are stunning, the walls rough-textured and flecked with straw on the outside, polished on the inside to that marble sheen you only find in Morocco and World of Interiors magazine. Approaching along one of the narrow waterways, you step through an arched gate into your own pri vate courtyard. The room alone is the size of a small chapel. Under a domed ceiling are sliding glass doors on three sides with sliding cedar shutters within. In the corner is a log-burning fire. Berber rugs are placed on the tiled floors. </p> <p>The marble bathroom has a semi-sunken bath beneath a sealed window looking onto a small basement garden of grapefruit trees. The view from your bath is rather like looking into the reptile house at the zoo. I would have tapped at the glass for hours had my wife not told me that the exotic snake I was studying was in fact a hose. </p> <p>Outside the room, beyond a little fountain, is a vaulted gazebo. We went to sleep by the light of the log fire and opened the cedar shutters in the morning to see the early sun glinting on the snow-capped Atlas mountains an hour's drive to the west. Pavilions 14 to 21 have this view, seen over the fairways of the golf course that borders the hotel on two sides. Pavilions in the thirties overlook a scratchy olive grove but would get the evening sun. </p> <p>Breakfast, like all meals at the Amanjena, can be Moroccan or European. We never did try the Berber corn soup, but the French toast with citrus curd, strawberries, almonds and lavender honey melted in the mouth, and the sweet almond milkshake was, well, sweet. And delicious. Once. </p> <p>The idea of Amanjena is to relax completely: read, sleep, be pampered at the health centre. A lot of the women guests - and, surprisingly, some of the men - seemed to be in the later stages of pregnancy. The hotel is the ideal place to escapebefore birth restricts your travel to somewhere only a couple of loo-stops away with easy access to a good maternity unit. </p> <p>Those in search of pampering should head for the Hammam, where gommage awaits. This is blissful, if at first disconcerting. A young male attendant beckons you to sit naked in the steam room before washing you with black olive soap, scrubbing you with a coarse grooming mitt and applying a mixture of clay, dried lavender and rose petals, eucalyptus oil and rosewater to your body and limbs. Throwing buckets of water over fat guests must provide some fun for the attendant, but otherwise the pleasure is all yours. The same goes for the four-hand massage. Two therapists who (slightly worrying, this) giggle simultaneously. </p> <p>For the rest, there are day trips, camel rides, a gym, and a golf course, which provides stunning views of the mountains, as picturesque as the Himalayas or the Sierra Nevada. We played in the afternoon and as the evening light threw a rosy wash over the peaks, the sky filled with huge ibises drifting in on the thermals to roost in the olive trees behind us. At one point I thought I heard the start of the call to evening prayer carry across the fairways, only to realise it was a distant cry of 'Fore!' </p> <p>For your ventures into Marrakesh, there is the inevitable trip to the souk, that teeming labyrinth of sights and smells, from the sweet cedar scent of the woodcraft shops to the leather shops, spice stalls and tiny supermarkets whose stock consists of soap, candles, leather polish and, usefully enough, limitless outfits for Lady Penelope dolls. Indulge in that embarrassing haggle with a rug salesman who will ply you with mint tea until you're persuaded to buy that carpet. Stroll through the evening crowds in the Place Djmaa el Fna, where jugglers and street vendors jostle between scores of makeshift food stalls, bracelet sellers and rich carpet salesmen. </p> <p>Visitors are often directed to Marrakesh's most famous restaurant, El Yacout, though from our experience it now seems to be trading heavily on its reputation. Make no mistake, the place is spectacular. The unassuming door leads into a magical setting: tables in cloisters set around an internal fountain; narrow stairs lead past more side chambers up to a roof terrace from which to take in the evening atmosphere over the city rooftops. </p> <p>You'd have to climb a good deal further to have sufficient appetite for the food, which is something of a trial by quantity. Course after course keeps arriving: pale, fatty chicken, mutton with couscous and watery vegetables, oranges in syrup. El Yacout is the haunt of the well-heeled (you may well see your rug salesman there), but Le Tobsil may provide an alternative. </p> <p>Back at base, Amanjena provides European fare (a truly delicious wild mushroom ragout, for example) or traditional Moroccan tagine or kebabs. Entertainment is provided by the kind of local dance troupe I imagine is kept tethered round the back in a compound somewhere. It's not something we have here. I don't think. Or do we? Is there a hotel in the Peak District somewhere that entertains guests with Morris Dancers? </p> <p>Amanjena provides a perfect retreat, ideal for a short break. But a word of warning: it doesn't come cheap. A friend of mine was once working on a book entitled Europe on a Thousand Dollars a Day . I never knew if he finished it before the publisher went bust, but to be honest, he'd have struggled here. Pavilions are around \u00a3450 a night, maisons more. But you do save on the air fare (around \u00a3350 with British Airways), and four nights here will leave you more relaxed than a week in the Caribbean, with no crack-of-dawn departures, overnight flights or jetlag - the kind of stress-laden travel that can easily wipe out the benefits of going away. The 230-room Mamounia, for all its tradition and beautiful gardens, seems like a Costa del Sol package hotel by comparison. </p> <p>If you want authentic Marrakesh, with all its sights, sounds and smells, best stay in town. Amanjena is the ultimate place to relax with as much, or as little, attention as possible. If you're unlucky with the weather, take refuge in the health spa or repair to the library, which in addition to books about Moroccan culture and traditions has a good stock of popular fiction and a surprisingly good selection of DVDs to enjoy in bed by your log fire. Marrakesh is even on GMT, so that if you really want to you can stride along the poolside talking to the office, like one particularly annoying Italian, but I don't recommend it. </p> <p>I wanted to be sceptical on your behalf, I really did. But everything, from the temperature of the pool to the warmth and friendliness of the staff, disarms you. The greatest drawback is the cost: everything carries a 20 per cent tax and service charge, and at these prices they really shouldn't charge to take you into town. Those with pressing reasons to flee the country immediately (livestock farmers, Tory MPs, former Northern Ireland Secretaries), might well be scouring the brochures as I write. This may ease their burden. It will, however, also lighten their wallet. Just go.</p> <p><strong>For ever and ever Aman</strong> </p> <p><strong> What are Aman junkies?</strong> <br> An elite group of travellers who spend their lives jetting from one minimalist Aman resort to the other. Once hooked, no other hotel will do. </p> <p><strong> What's the lure?</strong> <br> Life is cool, cool, cool (and we're not referring to the sea temperatures). These 12 resort hotels combine stark design based on local materials with outrageously attentive service on remote desert beaches, tropical jungles and up misty mountains. Not a hint of chintz, frills or gilt in sight. It's so good, most people don't want or need to leave the resort. The hotel is the holiday. </p> <p><strong> So what's new about that?</strong> <br> The original one, Amanpuri, started a global trend among hotels when Singapore-based visionary founder Adrian Zecha opened it in Phuket, Thailand, in 1988. Till its invention, the more money you spent on hiring a hotel room, the more fuss you got. At Aman the philosophy is small is beautiful and less is more. Now rival hip hotels from deepest Patagonia to Sao Paulo follow in its wake. </p> <p><strong> Who do these junkies include?</strong> <br> Prince Andrew, Naomi Campbell and Pierce Brosnan are fans (remember the pics of Andrew on that yacht with those topless women? That was on an Amanpuri holiday). There's also an army of twentysomething dotcom millionaires (who cashed in their shares before the slump) and City folk following the Aman trail between French Polynesia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico, US and France. </p> <p><strong> How much does it cost?</strong> <br> The average room is about \u00a3500 per night rising to around \u00a34,000 for a top three-bedroom villa. Service is second to none. There are often five mind-reading members of staff to every guest. Wrapping orchids round your suitcase handles on departure is the sort of nonsense guests come to expect. The Mahakua Hacienda de San Antonio in western Mexico, a converted ranch with its own private airstrip, serves honey straight from nearby beehives and milk from the resident cows, has 26 rooms built from local lava stone and incorporates seven kilometres of Mexican woven fabric in the bedding and curtains. </p> <p><strong> Anything else?</strong> <br> Personal butlers, rooms with private pools, sunken baths and your own motorised private buggy to get from bed to beach are not uncommon. At Le M\u00e8i\u00e8zin in Courchevel you can ski straight in and out of the resort. At Amanwana on the tropical island of Moyo, a nature reserve east of Bali, you can stay in tents with air-con and enjoy massages in the jungle. At the Amanpulo, an entire coral island called Pamalican in the Philippines you stay in small houses modelled on native dwellings called bahay kubos . They range in size from nine to 55 rooms and fill up quickly (despite the price), usually by word of mouth. </p> <p><strong> So if I win the lottery or rob a bank where can I book?</strong> <br> Try <a href=\"http://www.elegantresorts.co.uk\">Elegant Resorts</a> (01244 897000); Western &amp; Oriental (020 7313 6600); Classic Connection (0870 751 9310)</p>",

Till its invention, the more money you spent on hiring a hotel room, the more fuss you got. At Aman the philosophy is small is beautiful and less is more. Now rival hip hotels from deepest Patagonia to Sao Paulo follow in its wake. Who do these junkies include? Prince Andrew, Naomi Campbell and Pierce Brosnan are fans (remember the pics of Andrew on that yacht with those topless women? That was on an Amanpuri holiday). There's also an army of twentysomething dotcom millionaires (who cashed in their shares before the slump) and City folk following the Aman trail between French Polynesia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Mexico, US and France. How much does it cost? The average room is about \u00a3500 per night rising to around \u00a34,000 for a top three-bedroom villa. Service is second to none. There are often five mind-reading members of staff to every guest. Wrapping orchids round your suitcase handles on departure is the sort of nonsense guests come to expect. The Mahakua Hacienda de San Antonio in western Mexico, a converted ranch with its own private airstrip, serves honey straight from nearby beehives and milk from the resident cows, has 26 rooms built from local lava stone and incorporates seven kilometres of Mexican woven fabric in the bedding and curtains. Anything else? Personal butlers, rooms with private pools, sunken baths and your own motorised private buggy to get from bed to beach are not uncommon. At Le M\u00e8i\u00e8zin in Courchevel you can ski straight in and out of the resort. At Amanwana on the tropical island of Moyo, a nature reserve east of Bali, you can stay in tents with air-con and enjoy massages in the jungle. At the Amanpulo, an entire coral island called Pamalican in the Philippines you stay in small houses modelled on native dwellings called bahay kubos . They range in size from nine to 55 rooms and fill up quickly (despite the price), usually by word of mouth. So if I win the lottery or rob a bank where can I book? Try Elegant Resorts (01244 897000); Western &amp; Oriental (020 7313 6600); Classic Connection (0870 751 9310)",

      "body": "<p>Traditionally, the weekend visitor to Venice faced a stark choice: blow the budget on a luxury palace hotel or pay over the odds for a grotty dive with cramped, damp rooms, the bathroom at the end of a cold corridor, and a tepid cappuccino for breakfast. </p> <p>And that's if you were lucky enough to get a room. A shortage of accommodation means that for peak weekends in spring and autumn, hotels are fully booked as much as six months in advance. As one city break operator points out: 'If you've got rooms in Venice you can charge what you like for them, and most of them do. You won't get a decent three-star hotel room for less than \u00a3150 a night.' </p> <p>However, the good news is that local restrictions on opening and operating small bed and breakfast properties were lifted last year resulting in a new type of accommodation for Venice: locandas are small, family-run inns in beautifully renovated palaces. In the last year, about 20 have sprung up, offering double rooms from as little as \u00a350 a night. </p> <p>Decorated with chandeliers, frescoes and antiques, they offer all the luxury of a grand hotel, lacking only the trappings such as a concierge and 24-hour room service. The owners are usually on hand themselves running the place, the fur nishings are exquisite, breakfast is meticulously prepared and guests have the luxurious feeling of staying in an authentic Venetian palazzo. </p> <p>Often hidden away in back streets, these locandas are the perfect places to base yourself, quietly discover sights that are off the usual tourist track, and come upon bars and restaurants where you will also discover Venice's outstanding local cuisine and wines. Here are a pick of the best and newest spots. </p> <p> <strong> 1 Locanda Martini</strong><br> Rio Terra San Leonardo, 1314 Cannaregio <br>Tel: 041 717 512<br><a href=\"http://www.casamartini.it\">www.casamartini.it</a> <br>double room from \u00a360 </p> <p> There's not even a sign outside to help travellers find this tiny lodging house, a mere five rooms occupying one floor of an ancient mansion. There's a real feeling of staying in a private Venetian home, with a friendly communal kitchen for making tea and coffee and a sunny verandah overlooking a walled garden for romantic breakfasts. This locanda is just off one of the city's prettiest canals, the busy Canale di Cannaregio, where you can bag an outdoor table at one of the many waterside osterias and watch the non-stop traffic of boats, water buses and rowers rushing past. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Locanda ai Santi Apostoli</strong><br> Strada Nuova 4391, Cannaregio <br>Tel: 041 521 2612<br>double room from around \u00a3133 </p> <p> One of the earliest private palaces to be transformed into an intimate locanda, the Santi Apostoli is on the top floor (there is a lift) of an elegant palazzo, with wonderful views over the Grand Canal. Prices are not so cheap, though. Expect to pay an additional 100,000 lire for a room with a view over the canal. This locanda is just by one of the access points for a 'traghetto', the local gondola service for crossing the water. Everyone visiting Venice should try this at least once, as this fun trip will set you back only 30p. Arriving on the other side, you're right in the heart of the bustling Rialto fish and vegetable market, whose sights, sounds and smells are not to be missed by anyone with the vaguest interest in Italian food. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Locanda Leon Bianco</strong><br> Corte Leon Bianco 5629, Cannaregio<br> Tel: 041 523 3572<br> <a href=\"http://www.leonbianco.it\">www.leonbianco.it</a><br> double room from \u00a368 </p> <p> Located almost next door to the Santi Apostoli, the Leon Bianco is a much more down-to-earth residence, though it offers similar views. Check out one room that is decorated with a stunning fresco copied from a Paolo Veronese painting. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Locanda Casa Verado</strong><br> Calle Castagna 4765 Castello <br>Tel: 041 528 6138<br> double room from around \u00a385 </p> <p> Newly renovated, the cosy Casa Verado is one of the most seductive of the city's new locandas. Filling one floor of a sixteenth-century palace, the rooms are decorated with tasteful antiques, and most have views over the canals. In the summer there's an airy terrazza for breakfast, while in winter guests are served their food in the comfortable lobby. Casa Verado is located in a down-to-earth, working- class area of the Castello neighbourhood. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Locanda Vivaldi</strong><br> Riva degli Schiavoni 4150, Castello<br> Tel: 041 277 0477<br> <a href=\"http://www.locandavivaldi.it\">www.locandavivaldi.it</a><br> double room from \u00a3112 (lagoon view \u00a334 supplement) </p> <p> Of all the new locandas, the Vivaldi is the chicest and the closest to being a real hotel, which is not surprising given its location overlooking St Mark's basin, a stone's throw from the grand palace hotels lining Riva degli Schiavoni. The antiques furnishing every room are sumptuous, and the plush entrance cannot fail to impress. It is worth paying a supplement for a room with the ultimate view of St Mark's. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Locanda la Corte</strong><br> Calle Bressana 6317, Castello<br> Tel: 041 241 1300<br> <a href=\"http://www.locandalacorte.it\">www.locandalacorte.it</a><br> double room from \u00a3102 </p> <p> This locanda takes its name from the palace's interior courtyard, the kind of Venetian secret that most visitors never realise exists behind the closed door on the street. The young owners serve breakfast and early evening drinks in the courtyard. The rooms have all been beautifully renovated and decorated with antique furniture and Murano glass chandeliers. Just by the locanda is one of the city's prettiest and liveliest squares, the Campo Santa Maria Formosa, perfect just for sitting out on a cafe terrace and watching local life pass by. </p> <p> <strong> 7 La Residenza</strong><br> Campo Bandiera e Moro 3608, Castello<br> Tel: 041 528 5315<br> double room from around \u00a368 </p> <p> The 'piano nobile' of this venerable gothic palace makes for one of the most stunning lobbies in all Venice, the perfect place for reading and taking afternoon tea or cocktails. Although the rooms are fine, they don't quite match up to the first impressions when you check in. From here, it's a short walk to explore the narrow backstreets around the Arsenale, once the great shipyards providing the galleys for the Venetian fleet. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Locanda al Leon</strong><br> Campo Santi Filippo e Giacamo 4270, Castello <br>Tel: 041 277 0393<br> <a href=\"http://www.hotelalleon.com\">www.hotelalleon.com</a><br> double room from \u00a354 </p> <p> This friendly, family-run locanda has more of the feel of a country bed and breakfast place than a city hotel. The rooms are cosy but quite small, tastefully decorated without feeling plush. The big plus is the central location, a minute's walk from St Mark's, the Doge's Palace and the Bridge of Sighs, and directly behind the far more expensive Danieli Hotel. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Locanda San Barnaba</strong><br> Calle del Traghetto 2786, Dorsoduro <br>Tel: 041 241 1233<br> <a href=\"http://www.locanda-sanbarnaba.com\">www.locanda-sanbarnaba.com</a> <br> double room from \u00a385 </p> <p> The entrance and reception area of this locanda are not terribly impressive, but wait until you climb to the first floor, where the vast drawing room of this sixteenth-century palace is decorated with delicate pastel frescoes. The rooms are designed around themes such as 'the artist's studio' and 'the playwright's chamber'. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Locanda Casa Querini</strong><br>Campo San Giovanni Novo 4388, Castello <br>Tel: 041 241 1294<br> double room from around \u00a368 </p> <p> The setting could not be more perfect - a discreet palace hidden away in a tranquil campo just a couple of minutes from the crowds thronging the Piazza San Marco. The rooms are well decorated, though the breakfast salon doesn't quite live up to the rest of the surroundings. This locanda takes its name from the nearby Museo Querini Stampalia, an often overlooked museum set in a Renaissance palace that hosts offbeat temporary exhibitions, often on glass or photography, and has an excellent series of Tiepolo paintings of daily Venetian life in its permanent collection. </p> <p> <strong> 11 Locanda Antico Doge</strong><br> Sottoportego Falier 5643, Cannaregio <br>Tel: 041 241 1570<br> <a href=\"http://www.anticodoge.com\">www.anticodoge.com</a><br> double room from \u00a368 </p> <p> This plush residence is set in a thirteenth-century palace, the Palazzo Falier, once the home of a Venetian Doge. It looks over a busy canal where gondolas whisk back and forth, with the packed square Campo Sant' Apostoli in the background. A couple of minutes' walk from the hotel is an undistinguished church that most tourists walk straight past, the Chiesa Giovanni Grisostomo. Take the time to drop in though, as you'll discover a gem of a portrait by Bellini, painted in 1513 when he was over 80.</p> <p><strong>Eating out</strong></p> <p>John Brunton offers a personal selection of the most intimate restaurants and osterias where you can rub shoulders with the locals and try out Venetian specialities: </p> <p>\u0095 Venetian wine lovers adore La Cantina (041 522 8258), which is great for a light lunch of grilled vegetables and home-made soup accompanied by some of the finest vintages of Italian wines.</p> <p>\u0095 The Osteria al Pampo Sant' Elena (041 520 8419) offers great 'home cooking' favourites. The atmosphere is similar in the little-known Osteria Alle Alpi (041 528 5163), or Dante's Place, where the patron's wife serves tiny baby octopi and grilled squid.</p> <p>\u0095 For a romantic meal at a serious gastronomic address, book a table at the Ristorante Al Covo (041 522 3812), where the chef, Cesare, is a native Venetian, while the dining room is run by his friendly American wife, who is excellent at explaining local dishes and advising on regional wines.</p> <p>\u0095 Al Mascaron (041 522 5995) has become something of a Venetian dining institution, as well-known these days among tourists as locals. The chef, Carlo, delivers an unforgettable spaghetti con astice, pasta covered with succulent lobster morsels.</p> <p>\u0095 The Corte Sconta (041 522 7024) restaurant is one of the city's gastronomic landmarks. Prices are not cheap these days, but you'll experience a non-stop feast of delicious local dishes, culminating in an unforgettable fritto misto.</p> <p>\u0095 If you feel like a change from the fish and seafood that dominates Venetian cuisine, reserve a table at L'Incontro (041 522 2404), a rustic, Sardinian-run restaurant that specialises in meat dishes. Especially tasty are the grilled baby chicken and crackling roast pork.</p> <p>\u0095 The tiny bar of the Trattoria Alla Rivetta (041 528 7302) is always packed with tourists waiting for a table and locals popping in for a glass of chilled white wine. The friendly patron, Stefano, serves up delicious titbits of crisply fried calamari to keep everyone happy.</p> <p>\u0095 Just across the square, L'Aciughetta (041 522 4292) - the Anchovy Bar - serves a great choice of anchovy tapas and has a lengthy list of fine Italian wines.</p> <p>\u0095 For a serious taste of Venetian cooking, such as minuscule prawns heaped on creamy polenta, book a table well in advance in the stylish Fiaschetteria Toscana (041 528 5281), a restaurant much favoured by locals.</p> <p>\u0095 For a cheap and cheerful self-service bar which is great value for lunch, check out the Enoteca Boldrin (041 523 7859). It also has a wide selection of regional wines on sale to take away.</p> <p>\u0095 La Vedova (tel: 041 528 5324), 'the widow's place', is one of the city's oldest and most beautiful traditional osterias.

      "bodyText": "Traditionally, the weekend visitor to Venice faced a stark choice: blow the budget on a luxury palace hotel or pay over the odds for a grotty dive with cramped, damp rooms, the bathroom at the end of a cold corridor, and a tepid cappuccino for breakfast. And that's if you were lucky enough to get a room. A shortage of accommodation means that for peak weekends in spring and autumn, hotels are fully booked as much as six months in advance. As one city break operator points out: 'If you've got rooms in Venice you can charge what you like for them, and most of them do. You won't get a decent three-star hotel room for less than \u00a3150 a night.' However, the good news is that local restrictions on opening and operating small bed and breakfast properties were lifted last year resulting in a new type of accommodation for Venice: locandas are small, family-run inns in beautifully renovated palaces. In the last year, about 20 have sprung up, offering double rooms from as little as \u00a350 a night. Decorated with chandeliers, frescoes and antiques, they offer all the luxury of a grand hotel, lacking only the trappings such as a concierge and 24-hour room service. The owners are usually on hand themselves running the place, the fur nishings are exquisite, breakfast is meticulously prepared and guests have the luxurious feeling of staying in an authentic Venetian palazzo. Often hidden away in back streets, these locandas are the perfect places to base yourself, quietly discover sights that are off the usual tourist track, and come upon bars and restaurants where you will also discover Venice's outstanding local cuisine and wines. Here are a pick of the best and newest spots. 1 Locanda Martini Rio Terra San Leonardo, 1314 Cannaregio Tel: 041 717 512 www.casamartini.it double room from \u00a360 There's not even a sign outside to help travellers find this tiny lodging house, a mere five rooms occupying one floor of an ancient mansion. There's a real feeling of staying in a private Venetian home, with a friendly communal kitchen for making tea and coffee and a sunny verandah overlooking a walled garden for romantic breakfasts. This locanda is just off one of the city's prettiest canals, the busy Canale di Cannaregio, where you can bag an outdoor table at one of the many waterside osterias and watch the non-stop traffic of boats, water buses and rowers rushing past. 2 Locanda ai Santi Apostoli Strada Nuova 4391, Cannaregio Tel: 041 521 2612 double room from around \u00a3133 One of the earliest private palaces to be transformed into an intimate locanda, the Santi Apostoli is on the top floor (there is a lift) of an elegant palazzo, with wonderful views over the Grand Canal. Prices are not so cheap, though. Expect to pay an additional 100,000 lire for a room with a view over the canal. This locanda is just by one of the access points for a 'traghetto', the local gondola service for crossing the water. Everyone visiting Venice should try this at least once, as this fun trip will set you back only 30p. Arriving on the other side, you're right in the heart of the bustling Rialto fish and vegetable market, whose sights, sounds and smells are not to be missed by anyone with the vaguest interest in Italian food. 3 Locanda Leon Bianco Corte Leon Bianco 5629, Cannaregio Tel: 041 523 3572 www.leonbianco.it double room from \u00a368 Located almost next door to the Santi Apostoli, the Leon Bianco is a much more down-to-earth residence, though it offers similar views.

      "bodyText": "One of the unlikely candidates of Zurich or Geneva could soon take over from Amsterdam as favourite European city for a weekend of spliff-induced fun, if a new Bill legalising cannabis is passed by the Swiss government. The success of the Bill could mean the stereotypical tourist image of Switzerland as all mountains, lederhosen, chocolate, watches and boring bankers being thrown into disarray as young travellers are lured by the attraction of cheap soft drugs, the strong pound and cheap airline connections. Until the recent launches of low-cost airlines such as EasyJet and Buzz, air fares from the UK were prohibitively expensive. But you can now fly to Geneva from Stansted on Buzz for as little as \u00a3100 return or on EasyJet from Luton or Liverpool for \u00a350 return. Zurich is available on EasyJet from Luton from \u00a360 return. A spokeswoman for the Swiss Travel Service said: 'It might increase Switzerland's popularity if the Bill went through. Zurich is quite trendy and has quite a young image. If this Bill is passed, it could bring a younger element to Switzerland.' An EasyJet spokesman thought the move might spice up Switzerland's image. 'Would it have some impact on our business? Yes. Would we specifically market Switzerland as a place for drugs? No,' he said. Russell Palmer of Switzerland Tourism said it was too early to predict if the government would this week fully endorse the Bill to legalise the use of cannabis and allow a limited number of 'dope shops'.

A watershed in the Troubles, the deaths led to a huge outpouring of support for the Provisional IRA.</p> <p>Sands was 26 and serving 14 years for firearms offences when he began refusing food on 1 March 1981. Elected an MP during his fast, he resisted all pleas to call it off. His death after 66 days sparked violent protests and led to worldwide condemnation of Margaret Thatcher and her government.</p> <p>Now Sinn Fein has been attacked for planning a series of events including lectures, rallies, plays and a protest outside Thatcher's London home to commemorate the event. Critics, including the Sands family, have reacted with fury, accusing the Republican leadership of betraying the cause of a united Ireland and using the emotion of the anniversary to boost its own election chances.</p> <p>A painting by Robert Ballagh, a leading Irish artist, was commissioned to depict the death of the ten. It shows a large H breaking apart and 10 white doves flying into the air. Above is the word 'Legacy'.</p> <p>Sands's family and friends, including Bernadette Sands McKevitt, linked to the Real IRA, said the painting did not reflect the period or represent what he died for. They object to the use of 10 white doves to symbolise the hunger strikers, an image they believe fits in more with current Sinn Fein peace strategy. 'Bobby was many things but he was not a dove,' a friend of the family told The Observer .</p> <p>The Sands family has also complained about the use of Sands's writings and image to promote Sinn Fein's policies. Relatives are currently engaged in a legal dispute to wind up the Bobby Sands Trust, an organisation that still owns his writings, claiming the trust is too close to the Sinn Fein leadership.</p> <p>Some of the 13 prisoners who survived the hunger strike have, in general, remained loyal to the republican leadership of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. They include Laurence McKeown who survived more than 70 days and recently recorded his experiences in a documentary he co-directed.</p> <p>Other ex-IRA inmates who took part in a previous hunger strike, such as Brendan 'Darkie' Hughes, the former Provisional commander in Belfast, believe Sands and his comrades did not die in order to achieve the present political settlement. They wanted a united Ireland.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.larkspirit.com/hungerstrikes\" target=\"_NEW\">www.larkspirit.com/hungerstrikes</a></p>",

Sands was 26 and serving 14 years for firearms offences when he began refusing food on 1 March 1981. Elected an MP during his fast, he resisted all pleas to call it off. His death after 66 days sparked violent protests and led to worldwide condemnation of Margaret Thatcher and her government. Now Sinn Fein has been attacked for planning a series of events including lectures, rallies, plays and a protest outside Thatcher's London home to commemorate the event. Critics, including the Sands family, have reacted with fury, accusing the Republican leadership of betraying the cause of a united Ireland and using the emotion of the anniversary to boost its own election chances. A painting by Robert Ballagh, a leading Irish artist, was commissioned to depict the death of the ten. It shows a large H breaking apart and 10 white doves flying into the air. Above is the word 'Legacy'. Sands's family and friends, including Bernadette Sands McKevitt, linked to the Real IRA, said the painting did not reflect the period or represent what he died for. They object to the use of 10 white doves to symbolise the hunger strikers, an image they believe fits in more with current Sinn Fein peace strategy. 'Bobby was many things but he was not a dove,' a friend of the family told The Observer . The Sands family has also complained about the use of Sands's writings and image to promote Sinn Fein's policies. Relatives are currently engaged in a legal dispute to wind up the Bobby Sands Trust, an organisation that still owns his writings, claiming the trust is too close to the Sinn Fein leadership. Some of the 13 prisoners who survived the hunger strike have, in general, remained loyal to the republican leadership of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. They include Laurence McKeown who survived more than 70 days and recently recorded his experiences in a documentary he co-directed. Other ex-IRA inmates who took part in a previous hunger strike, such as Brendan 'Darkie' Hughes, the former Provisional commander in Belfast, believe Sands and his comrades did not die in order to achieve the present political settlement. They wanted a united Ireland. www.larkspirit.com/hungerstrikes",

Now they are left, like the rest of America, with the debts and worthless stocks.</p> <p>And the crisis in the American financial system is matched by one in Japan. Japan's massive financial bubble burst 10 years ago and it has yet to clear up the financial detritus. The banking system is racked by up to $350 billion of bad debts, but the banks' capacity to ride the financial hit is undermined by the downward plunge of the Japanese stock market because their own capital is invested in the shares of other banks - a double whammy which already means many are technically bankrupt. And if we take seriously the hint from Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa that Japan might be the first major state since the war to unilaterally write down the value of its national debt, its financial system has to be regarded as on the brink. For the world to have one calamity would be bad enough; to have two simultaneously is more than careless.</p> <p>It is eerily reminiscent not of the kind of recessions of the post-war period - which have been painful enough - but of the recessions up until 1930, as Larry Summers, the outgoing US Treasury Secretary, has said. Japan and the US have in their different ways made the cardinal error; they allowed their stock markets to become too intertwined with their overall financial system, reinventing the impulses that made nineteenth and early twentieth century recessions so vicious. What made those recessions last twice as long as post-war recessions was that they were accompanied and reinforced by bank and stock market collapses.</p> <p>In Britain there is no longer any folk memory of what it means for a bank to go bankrupt, but as recently as the 1880s major banks could go bust, sending local economies into tailspin; firms lost their credit lines and workers and consumers their savings. In the US the experience was no less raw. The New York stock market began to have national importance as early as the mid-nineteenth century, and its ups and downs rippled out across the national economy. Banks were no more stable than the strength of the city or town in which they traded, and if one went down others followed like nine-pins. As the pace of industrialisation and urbanisation quickened in Europe and the US, workers could be suddenly thrown out of work by equally sudden contractions of credit lines and investment funds. The 1930s slump was the last of the great stock market and bank-induced economic collapses.</p> <p>The great success story of the 50 years that followed, led by liberal and social democratic politicians, was to tame these wild forces. A mixture of regulation, credit control and state intervention in the banking system stabilised the financial system while welfare states helped underwrite the risk to ordinary workers and give them buying power that contributed to stabilising demand.</p> <p>But as the consequences of the irrationalities of stock market gyrations and wild bank-lending - the consequence of applying free market economic principles to finance - were forgotten, so the reasons for the regulations were forgotten too. Know-nothing politicians of the Right, their intellectual acolytes and financier paymasters lobbied increasingly for 'deregulation' and 'liberalisation'. Bit by bit the controls came off. In the US, Rooseveltian financial reforms of the New Deal were scrapped over the 1980s and 1990s as hindering the competitiveness of US banking. American finance now has all the 'freedoms' it had in the nineteenth century, taking us back to the same wild capitalism.</p> <p>My hunch is that the world is about to learn an awesome lesson; the conservative theorists were wrong and the liberal Keynesians right. The information technology revolution may have constructed a new economy, but it is one that has ancient parallels. IT could never have got off the ground so quickly without stock market finance, but it had the impact of making an already febrile and irrational investment community even more stupid, speculative and herd-like than usual as it chased what it imagined were new pots of IT gold.</p> <p>Moreover, IT has been one of the reasons it has been so hard to regulate finance, with the borders between banks and the stock market becoming so much more porous; banks may be bigger but their disastrous nineteenth century-type exposures to stock market losses have been reinvented. To be effective regulation had to become smarter, faster and more international, but in the current environment building the essentially left-of-centre coalitions that might effect such regulation has been difficult.</p> <p>So we are where we are.

In this respect Japan presents a warning. The losses go so deep that policy interventions such as lowering interest rates and reducing taxes are much less effective than they were in the immediate post-war period. The US has a market structure that means it will get the adjustment over more quickly and radically than Japan - but that means any recession will be compensatingly more intense.</p> <p>Europe will not escape the fall-out - but it is in a much stronger position precisely because its stock markets (except in Britain) have a much less central role in its financial system. And despite some wobble under fire from ignorant American critics and their British poodles, Europe has maintained a regulatory structure that retains that insulation.

The major sticking point was over Government plans to bring private investment into the Tube, the so-called public-private partnership (PPP). Three companies would own different Underground lines and would run them in competition with each other. Kiley said that the plans were 'idiotic', overly complex and would increase the risk of safety lapses. The breakthrough came on Friday night when Kiley, who was hired by the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, produced a 55-point plan on how the Underground should be run. The Government has now conceded to most of Kiley's demands, although it has not agreed to him owning a 51 per cent share of the Tube.

Or the realisation that the lives of bed-and-breakfast owners are being smashed to maximise the export earnings of a privileged few. Or the contrast between automatic compensation for farmers and official indifference to other victims.</p> <p>Whatever it was, the great plague of 2001 seems to have created a seismic shift in attitudes to Britain's rural regime.</p> <p>The BBC's lingering pictures of tearful farmers' wives seem to have evoked something other than unqualified sympathy. At last people are beginning to ask why we have to put up with all this. Before foot and mouth closed the countryside and demanded yet another dollop of taxpayers' cash, we had swine fever and BSE. All these were brought to us by an industry which pollutes our water, abuses its animals and engages in the wholesale destruction of our landscape, wildlife and archeological heritage. An industry whose practitioners expect us to pay for all this through limitless subsidy and inflated food prices, and then object to a right to roam.</p> <p>Why? There is no obvious answer. Britain's farming industry is a marginal player in a globally ever more competitive business. To survive, it finds it necessary to wreak continual havoc on the rest of us. Yet it could not exist on its current scale without the array of subsidies and other privileges we choose to bestow on it. Guess what? We do not have to provide these.</p> <p>We must eat; but it has been clear for centuries that we should do better to buy most of our food from countries more suited to sheep runs and prairies than our own crowded island. Other industries have had their day, turned subsidy-junkie and eventually become more trouble than they were worth - mining, textiles, shipbuilding, steel-making. All were subjected to the harsh laws of economic reality. New activities have taken their place, and re-employed their former workers. If our farming industry were subject to the same rules, we should now be putting it out of its misery. Yet we have treated it as sacrosanct. Just why, exactly?</p> <p>The idea learnt from childhood picture books that farming is more real, purer, closer to the soil, more in touch with the rhythm of the seasons than our own post-lapsarian activities may have something to do with it. Such misplaced sentimentality has made us easy prey for whatever message the farming industry's potent propaganda machine happens to be pumping out. Yet the current message is hardly persuasive.</p> <p>Our farmers know that we know that food surpluses, not shortages, are the problem nowadays, and that their strategic importance is a thing of the past. So they are telling us that we need them now to be the custodians of our countryside. Without their efforts, they would have us believe, what remains of our landscape would disintegrate. The tourist industry, now suffering so painfully on their behalf, would therefore collapse as well.</p> <p>But what would really happen if support for British agriculture were withdrawn? Probably around a third of the land currently under cultivation would continue to produce food competitively. Some of the farms which survived would be high-grade specialist outfits, delivering niche products at premium prices. More, however, would be large units turning out vast quantities of grain, efficiently and soullessly. These would offer few charms for walkers and sustain little wildlife. Yet, unpopular though such farms are, their profitability would equip them to meet environmental, hygiene and animal welfare obligations more easily than the struggling, small-scale, mixed establishments which polite opinion currently favours.</p> <p>Meanwhile, agriculture could be expected to beat a slow retreat from much of the rest of the countryside. With it would go its trim and tidy fieldscape. Farmers would like us to believe we are inextricably attached to this kind of rural scenery. Yet the idea that as much as 80 per cent of our rural landscape should be farmed, as it is at present, is relatively novel. Until subsidy revived it after World War II, farming in Britain suffered a 100-year recession. Much of the marginal land which has now been ploughed up was left derelict, to be colonised by bramble and hawthorn, cornflower and dog-rose. The resulting landscape, unkempt and wildlife-rich, formed the countryside of pastoral myth which most of us now know only from art galleries.</p> <p>We need to learn once more that, in spite of our farmers' grim warnings, we have nothing to fear from the incursion of indigenous flora into our landscape. On the contrary, we desperately need more wilderness in our over-domesticated outdoors. Where, under the Common Agricultural Policy, farmers have been paid 'set-aside' to leave land be, we already see welcome rashes of forgotten wild flowers reappearing. Birds and butterflies have seized on these oases, and used them to restore some fraction of the populations they maintained before these were devastated by modern farming.</p> <p>While other countries make a point of dedicating wilderness areas, Britain has almost none. We could do with spaces where we could see what happens to our country when left to its own devices, to follow the progression from flowers to scrub to woodland. Our wild red deer, rather than farmers' sheep, could graze our open moorland, as they already do in the Highlands. We lecture Third World countries about the need to preserve their rainforests without making any effort to restore the lost habitat of our own wildlife.</p> <p>Abandoned farmland, recolonised by our own wild fauna and flora, could be our contribution to the restoration of biodiversity.</p> <p>Yet, away from remoter areas, would redundant farmland really lie as desolate as farmers like to suggest? In our crowded island, there is a desperate hunger for land. Some of this comes from demand for building development, particularly for homes. Yet the fear that Wimpey estates would fill any gap left by agriculture is misplaced.</p> <p>Whenever they get the chance, farmers are all too willing to pocket the enormous profits they gain from selling their fields for homes. What stops them most of the time is the planning system, which tightly restricts new building in the countryside. There are plenty of potential new owners of rural land who would have no problem with current planning restrictions. At present, high land prices, bloated by agricultural subsidy, are keeping them out. If subsidies were withdrawn, land prices would fall. Then, conservation and wildlife organisations such as the National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the county wildlife trusts would be able to extend their holdings. Individuals keen to establish their own nature reserves or amenity woodlands might be able to do so. Local authorities could afford to create more country parks. Tree cover in Britain is only a fraction of what it is in continental Europe: foresters would be able to begin to redress this shortfall. And the army of would-be subsistence smallholders might at last gain a foothold in our countryside.</p> <p>Between them, these new owners would create a very different countryside. We have every reason to believe it would be far more attractive to us, and to the wild creatures with whom we would share it, than the existing farmscape, devoid of skylarks, orchids, newts and buttercups.</p> <p>If we wanted to adjust this new landscape, to create more wetlands for the bittern, say, or steppes to lure back the bustard, we could use public money to do so. But instead of giving farmers limitless sums to do what they want, we could apply money surgically, to pursue the purposes we choose.</p> <p>Rather than dictating the shape of our landscape, some former farmers might find a new role, managing grazing stock to achieve the conservation and recreation goals of the private and public owners who would supplant them.</p> <p>None of this is fantastic. It is all within our grasp. What is fantastic is our inability to shake ourselves free of the idea that our countryside must be one big farm, however much money this wastes and however much nuisance it causes. Instead, our countryside can be once more the landscape of our dreams.

      "body": "<p>John Prescott was at the centre of a furious row last night over his decision to use private-sector lobbyists working for the transport industry to advise him during the general election.</p> <p>The Deputy Prime Minister, whose portfolio includes transport, and his usual special adviser, Joe Irvine, will work closely with Mike Craven, chief executive of lobbying firm Lexington. The company's clients include British Airways and Metronet, the consortium involving Balfour Beatty which is bidding to run parts of London Underground under Prescott's contentious privatisation scheme.</p> <p>Craven, who worked for Prescott in the Eighties, will be his speechwriter and conduct 'research'.</p> <p>He also lobbies for Serco, the firm leading one of the controversial consortia bidding to run a privatised National Air Traffic Control Service, championed by Prescott. Lexington also lobbies for Novartis, the biotech firm heavily involved in genetically modified crops.</p> <p>As well as transport, Prescott's huge department is responsible for the environment and regional affairs. Stephen Hardwick, the chief lobbyist for the British Airports Authority (BAA), which owns Heathrow and Gatwick, will also be working for the Labour Party and is a close friend of Prescott's special adviser.</p> <p>Prescott has just received a planning inspector's report on BAA's plans to build a fifth terminal at Heathrow, and is personally responsible for deciding whether to give it the go-ahead. The planning inquiry lasted six years and was bitterly fought.</p> <p>John Stewart, head of the campaign against the terminal, said Labour's decision to use Hardwick was 'outrageous'. He claimed it could be grounds for a judicial review of the entire process.</p> <p>'I am shocked. This is completely unacceptable and raises serious questions about the impartiality of Prescott. This just shows how close the Minister is to BAA. What would BAA say if they discovered our group and Friends of the Earth were advising Ministers?

      "bodyText": "John Prescott was at the centre of a furious row last night over his decision to use private-sector lobbyists working for the transport industry to advise him during the general election. The Deputy Prime Minister, whose portfolio includes transport, and his usual special adviser, Joe Irvine, will work closely with Mike Craven, chief executive of lobbying firm Lexington. The company's clients include British Airways and Metronet, the consortium involving Balfour Beatty which is bidding to run parts of London Underground under Prescott's contentious privatisation scheme. Craven, who worked for Prescott in the Eighties, will be his speechwriter and conduct 'research'. He also lobbies for Serco, the firm leading one of the controversial consortia bidding to run a privatised National Air Traffic Control Service, championed by Prescott. Lexington also lobbies for Novartis, the biotech firm heavily involved in genetically modified crops. As well as transport, Prescott's huge department is responsible for the environment and regional affairs. Stephen Hardwick, the chief lobbyist for the British Airports Authority (BAA), which owns Heathrow and Gatwick, will also be working for the Labour Party and is a close friend of Prescott's special adviser. Prescott has just received a planning inspector's report on BAA's plans to build a fifth terminal at Heathrow, and is personally responsible for deciding whether to give it the go-ahead. The planning inquiry lasted six years and was bitterly fought. John Stewart, head of the campaign against the terminal, said Labour's decision to use Hardwick was 'outrageous'. He claimed it could be grounds for a judicial review of the entire process. 'I am shocked. This is completely unacceptable and raises serious questions about the impartiality of Prescott. This just shows how close the Minister is to BAA. What would BAA say if they discovered our group and Friends of the Earth were advising Ministers? They would go mad,' Stewart said. Charles Secrett, director of Friends of the Earth, said: 'New Labour seems to have forgotten the first rule of the market. There is no such thing as a free lunch. 'These lobbyists will want paying, and they obtain their payment after the election by being able to win lucrative contracts from companies, claiming they can get privileged access to Ministers and [can] influence policies.' After the last general election, The Observer revealed that many Labour advisers went on to work for political lobbying firms and used their contacts with Ministers to obtain special favours for corporate clients. Prescott will not be alone in using corporate lobbyists this time. Colin Byrne, managing director of lobbying firm Weber Shandwick will work for Labour's business relations unit, which will be responsible for securing donations and ensuring its pro-business message gets through. Shandwick acts for construction giant Carillion, Tesco and the investment bank Goldman Sachs. New laws governing political donations to parties say any 'help' given by private sector firms during the campaign will count and must be published in the party's accounts. General Secretary Margaret McDonagh is keen to use Labour-supporting lobbyists to bolster operations at the party's Millbank headquarters, but is understood to be aware of the danger of potential scandals after polling day, when the lobbyists return to advise companies wanting to influence government policy. She is understood to have agreed with a number of lobbyists that they should keep a low profile, and is privately furious that Craven has been speaking openly about his role with Prescott. Neither Craven nor Hardwick responded to calls. A Labour Party spokeswoman said it was 'very pleased and proud that so many people want to work for us at election time'. 'All parties use volunteers. Those working for Ministers will be Labour Party members and not working on any departmental issues. Whoever we take on, we will abide by the law and the advice of the Electoral Commission.'",

      "bodyText": "Foreign Office Minister Keith Vaz has personally overturned decisions by immigration officers an unprecedented 50 times since he took charge of overseeing visa applications to Britain in October 1999. One former senior Foreign Office official who is intimate with the visa application process has described this as 'an astonishing number'. Opposition MPs are demanding an urgent investigation by the Prime Minister. According to Whitehall sources, it has been 'extremely rare' for both recent Labour and Tory Ministers to overturn decisions by embassies and British High Commissions around the world when entry visas are denied to people wishing to visit the UK. Vaz, who is fighting for his political life following his role in the Hinduja passport affair and damning evidence that he tried to obstruct a parliamentary investigation into his financial affairs, will now come under intense pressure to give full details of the cases he has been involved in and explain why he has been rejecting advice from senior immigration officials. Opposition MPs who have been calling for his resignation believe this could be the final nail in his Ministerial career. They claim there is a potential conflict of interest because the Minister's wife, Maria Fernandes, is an immigration lawyer whose practice specialises in visa issues. She has always denied that such a conflict arises. She is the author of a guide - dedicated to her husband - aimed at assisting people from Asian countries in obtaining visitors' visas to Britain. MPs are demanding to know whether the Minister's wife has been involved in any of the cases or whether the individuals are linked to Vaz's business associates or Labour donors. Vaz and the Foreign Office have refused repeated demands to release details of the cases where the Minister, has personally intervened claiming it would breach 'confidentiality' rules. A parliamentary answer from the Foreign Office to Liberal Democrat MP David Rendel confirmed that Vaz intervened 18 times to overrule decisions by the British High Commission in India not to allow Indian nationals to enter the UK. Sources claim that officials in the British High Commission in Bombay have privately expressed 'concern' at Vaz's interventions although no one would comment on the record and all questions were referred to London. Vaz became embroiled in the Hinduja passport affair, after an Observer investigation revealed his close links with the Indian billionaires and how he had intervened with the Home Office over their passport applications. Last night Liam Fox, the Tory shadow health spokesman who was Minister for visas under John Major's government, said: 'In my personal experience as a Minister, British immigration officers working overseas are highly experienced professionals working within strict rules set down by House of Commons. 'Ministers need exceptional reasons to overturn their decisions and I can only recall three times this happened when I was in office. It calls into question Cook's judgment in giving him the job in the first place. Tony Blair must investigate.' Liberal Democrat MP David Rendel began asking Vaz parliamentary questions over his role in overturning visa decisions after reading an Observer investigation into the use of illegal 'slave labour' from India at a Hindu temple in north London. He has now written to the Minister demanding details of all those who Vaz has helped into the country and his reasons for overruling immigration officials. Last week it emerged that Vaz requested the visa portfolio from Foreign Secretary Robin Cook when he became a Minister in the Foreign Office. The visa guidebook written by Vaz's wife covers family, business, transit and medical visits to the UK and is designed to do away with the long delays and problems many Asians face when entering Britain. It is dedicated 'to my husband Keith for his inspiration and encouragement' and 'to those who struggle every day to grapple with the complexities of our immigration system'. Income from selling this guide was channelled into a company called Mapesbury Communications, which was originally set up by the Minister when he was a backbench MP in 1996. The company became a key focus for the parliamentary commissioner Elizabeth Filkin, who was concerned that revenues from Mapesbury were being used to support the Minister's parliamentary office without his having declared it. Despite repeated requests for information from Filkin and the Standards and Privileges Committee, both the Minister and his wife declined to open the firm's books. A spokesman for the Foreign Office denied there was anything improper about Vaz's overrulings. He said: 'Almost two million visas are applied for a year and fewer than 150,000 are rejected.

At the other end of the stretch, John Major prolonged his government well beyond its natural life. By clinging on until the very fag-end of the last parliament, he only managed to make his defeat that much worse. If Mr Blair calls off May, can he be sure it will be OK by June? If he's pushed into the autumn, can he be certain he'll still be popular in September? And if that goes pear-shaped, he may find himself contemplating next spring. The folklore of British politics says that Prime Ministers are highly unwise to trap themselves against the buffers. Such are the arguments raging within the high command of the Government. Number 10's implacable statements that there are no plans to postpone the election put a brave face on inner agonising. Election timing is the staple of private conversation between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who has the most decisive other voice on the question. Technically, the final choice does not need to be made for another three weeks. A May election could be called as late as early April. For most practical purposes, because to call off the general election implies rushing through emergency legislation to postpone the local polls as well, the moment of truth for Mr Blair is this coming week. He can safely cast aside the bogus arguments for delaying the election. For the vast majority of the country, including the greater part of the countryside, campaigning will be unaffected by foot and mouth. A senior member of the Tory front bench, who has a highly rural constituency, admitted to me last week that it would make next to no difference to his electioneering. Only nostalgics believe that modern elections turn on stump campaigning in draughty village halls. The contest will be fought on television, radio and through the press. One-to-one communing between candidate and voter was long ago supplanted by telephone, post and now email. The issue for Mr Blair and those who guide him is not about mechanics. It is to do with the atmospherics. The spread of foot and mouth has so far confounded the Government's protestations that everything is under control. The saturation media coverage has also defied Alastair Campbell's often reliable private rule that few news stories last for more than 48 hours, and only the most exceptional crisis endures in the headlines for more than a week. If the disease is still raging in early May, then the campaign will be fought against the smell of putrid cattle flesh and the noise of millions of sheep being shot in the head. Rural skies blackened by burning carcasses, that image from the Dark Ages, is not exactly the ideal scenery for Tony Blair to explain his vision of a government of competent reform putting Britain on the leading edge of the twenty-first century. The Cabinet's best strategist is a worried man. During private debates about the issue, Gordon Brown has been heard to ask: 'Would we look cynical?' He and Mr Blair both know that they will most certainly be accused of that. The risk of an unnecessarily early election, called in disregard of pleas to delay, is that it emphasises the least attractive features of New Labour. It will be called not just cynical, but arrogant and tasteless. The Prime Minister will be charged - and is bound to suffer from the accusation - that he has put his own selfish interests above those of the country. The question for Tony Blair about the election is not how big he wins; what matters most is how well he wins. The precise scale of his majority is not as significant as the style of his victory. New Labour needs this election to be an instrument of renewal. To make a success of its second term, the Government wants to win the election with a reinvigorated sense of purpose and some endorsing enthusiasm for a radical second term from the country. Out of the election must flow a sense that they have made their arguments and won a mandate. The Dead Cow Election does not fit that picture. Tony Blair is in a crucially different position to Jim Callaghan and John Major. They put off elections because they were weak. Postponement of polling day by Mr Blair would be a display of self-confidence. It would say that winning for him is not down to accidents of timing, but to the intrinsic appeal of his ideas and the strength of his government. The Prime Minister has a few, difficult days remaining before he must make up his mind. Should his decision be to delay the election, this will be the act, and it will deserve to be acknowledged as the act, of a strong man.",

      "body": "<p>It all happened very fast. One minute I was strolling towards Hyde Park Corner to catch a late-night tube, the next I was surrounded by earnest young Germans. Some looked close to tears, others stared at an upstairs window and clutched hand-written cardboard placards. All wore strangely glazed expressions. </p> <p>After an unnerving few seconds when I feared I was about to be kidnapped by a cult, I realised I had unwittingly stumbled on the travelling throng of Michael Jackson worshippers. His website had revealed he was staying at London's Lanesborough Hotel during his recent visit to speak at the Oxford Union, and the students were camped out hoping to glimpse their idol. </p> <p>They may be misguided but they had their directions spot-on. Jackson was staying in the Lanesborough: more precisely he was staying in the Royal Suite. At \u00a34,500 a night, it claims to be the most expensive hotel accommodation in the UK - and that's before you add on Vat, taking it to a cool \u00a35,287.50. Oh yes, dinner and breakfast are not included. </p> <p>The cosmetically enhanced singer is not the only superstar to think it's worth the money. Madonna, Mariah Carey, Sly Stallone, Celine Dion and Michael Bolton have all stayed, as have business gurus such as Oracle's Larry Ellison and politicians including President Bush Sr and various Russian Prime Ministers. Stanley Kubrick filmed the strangely un-erotic sex scenes for Eyes Wide Shut in the suite's junior bedroom. </p> <p>By mere mortals' standards \u00a35,287.50 - the equivalent of more than 75 nights at Battersea Travelodge - is an extraordinary outlay for a night's kip. So in the spirit of investigative journalism, I checked into the suite at the central London hotel, at present on the market for about \u00a3110 million, to find out exactly what bang you get for your big bucks. </p> <p>For starters there was the chauffeured \u00a3160,000 seven-litre Bentley Mulliner - 8mpg, \u00a375 to fill up - which came with the suite. My driver, Zoran Matic, who is perhaps more used to ferrying celebrities after they've passed through the paparazzi at Heathrow, seemed unfazed by a pick-up outside a small flat in Clapham. And yes, curtains did twitch. </p> <p>Then there were the butlers. Not one but two, and as with the Bentley, they were available throughout my stay. On arrival at the Lanesborough I was handed over like the Olympic torch from driver, via doorman and house manager, David Cowdery, to Sean and Karen, my personal butlers. Nothing like Jeeves, they mixed friendliness with frightening efficiency. </p> <p>It was the kind of welcome I could get used to. There were personalised business cards and stationery, explosions of flowers from the in-house florist, a bottle of Perrier-Jouet champagne on ice, and a fruit bowl containing the largest strawberries seen outside Chernobyl. </p> <p>Delusions of grandeur immediately kicked in. As Sean told me about the hotel's fitness studio, I asked if I had to train in front of other guests - global superstars rarely like to wobble in public. 'Course not Sir,' came the straight-faced reply. 'I can have the equipment moved up to your suite. You can work out by the window, it's a lovely view over Green Park.' </p> <p>He was right. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered a stunning outlook over the Wellington Arch. The only thing missing was glassy-eyed German students gazing in my direction. I made a mental note to ask Sean to arrange for them to be outside later. </p> <p>After a parting observation on our Buckingham Palace neighbours, 'they don't cause us much trouble, they're very quiet' - banter that Americans must love - he dis creetly withdrew. </p> <p>I was alone in my nine-room (not counting the extra toilet, washroom and kitchen), 2,845 sq ft suite. There was the 45ft sitting room, dining room for 12 that Princess Diana used for a Red Cross party, master bedroom with bathroom en-suite with Jacuzzi and steam shower, and two other bedroom/bathrooms, all connected by a maze of doors and tunnels. Anyone with a short-term memory lapse could be lost for days. </p> <p>Decor-wise, the Royal Suite is a minimalist's nightmare. Originally the country home of Viscount Lanesborough, to which a spectacular Wilkins frontage was added in 1812, after serving many years as a hospital the building was turned into a hotel a decade ago under the management of the Dallas-based Rosewood group. They commissioned a British interior designer to reproduce the style of a Regency country home - and that meant a heavy gilt trip. </p> <p>There are gilt-framed portraits and huge mirrors at either end of the sitting room, gold-coloured clocks and giant eagles supporting marble table tops, gold and black candle sticks, gold friezes around the ceilings. A magnificent writing desk is decorated with gold-headed Egyptian figures and surrounded by gold wood chairs. The main bedroom has a gold-canopied four-poster, golden walls and curtains and ornate gilt table mirror. If Regency's your style, it's a reproduction treasure; if not, the decor can become oppressive, and the more modern Metropolitan across Hyde Park Corner would be a better bet. I quickly found myself seeing the world through gilt-tinted spectacles. </p> <p>Ironically, at the same time as the Lanesborough opened, Cowdery was working on the launch of the Royalton in New York, the first sleek collaboration between Ian Shrager and Philippe Starck. </p> <p>Behind the early nineteenth-century facade I discovered a stack of hi-tech gadgets: an in-room computer with lightning web access and, from this week, there is internet radio so you can listen to local stations from New York to Buenos Aires. There are no less than 15 phone handsets - useful if your demented aunt has got lost at the other end of the suite - and a mobile so you can be reached via your room number even when you're out about town. </p> <p>Reclining on my gold four-poster in a luxurious Lanesborough dressing gown after a spin in the Jacuzzi, I dimmed the lights through my computerised bedside panel, and enjoyed a perfect Leslie Phillips moment. </p> <p>But according to Cowdery, the \u00a34,500 price tag shouldn't be related to the facilities. 'It's about intangibles,' he insists. 'It's about prestige and a unique experience, like the butler who can find whatever you're looking for. For people who want the Royal Suite at the Lanesborough, it's not about money. The price could be \u00a35,000 or \u00a36,000.' </p> <p>Whatever the appeal, it appears to work. The suite was occupied for three quarters of last year, of which half had paid full price, with the others on upgrade. So if you booked in for your wedding anniversary on a standard double rate of \u00a3370 plus tax, you never know your luck. If you were upgraded, I would strongly advise caution on the mini bar (cashews \u00a312.50) and the in-room wine list (Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus 1970 \u00a32,900, Ch\u00e2teau D'yquem 1921 \u00a33,550). </p> <p>At 12.10am, it was clearly time to call on the famed services of the Lanesborough butler. I urgently needed a recommendation for an Ethiopian restaurant, a fresh 35mm film, and fitness cycle delivered to my room for when I woke next morning. Tony, my night butler, did not disappoint. Within minutes he recommended the Ethiopian restaurant in Brixton - 'would you like us to make a booking Sir?' - and had tracked down a night chemist who unfortunately did not stock film.

      "body": "<p>They are calling them scalpel safaris. Hundreds of British women are flocking to South Africa to witness the delights of the country's wildlife - and arrive home looking years younger. </p> <p>Travel agents are marketing the joys of constant South African sunshine with the opportunity to have plastic surgery through special combined packages that cost a fraction of the price here. </p> <p>Surgeons and Safari will help patients organise a whole package of game viewing and plastic surgery. Clients are met at the airport and guided through every stage of the process for one week or a fortnight. </p> <p>It is already proving a success. Last week two British women from Guernsey, Diana Davison and Kathleen Rosenthal, were recovering after their surgery. Davison said they were looking forward to returning home looking a few years younger. 'I had an insurance policy payout and I didn't want a cruise. This just seemed a good idea,' said Davison, 65. </p> <p>For Perin Lewis, plastic surgery was not a matter of looking younger. It was just a desire to press the pause button on the ageing process. 'I just wanted to suspend the effects of gravity for a while,' said the 61-year-old Londoner. </p> <p>Everything is on offer in South Africa and the market is estimated to have quadrupled over the past two years as a result of foreign women - and a few men - taking advantage of low prices and well-trained surgeons. </p> <p>Lewis, who organises conference events from her Hampstead house, has no regrets about choosing to go to South Africa, where her daughter, a model, had already had several operations. </p> <p>'It has been fantastic. I was so impressed,' said Lewis, who has had a face and eye lift. Lewis has recommended the treatment to dozens of her friends, 10 of whom have since followed her advice and headed south for an operation and a spot of game viewing. </p> <p>The result has been boom time in the spotless and ultra-modern clinics of Johannesburg and Cape Town. 'At first it spread just by word of mouth, mainly from people who had left South Africa to go and live in Britain and told their British friends about standards here. But now the demand is just exploding,' said Dr Saul Braun, who runs the Rosebank Clinic in Johannesburg and operated on Lewis and her friends. </p> <p>Braun believes he has operated on more than 130 British women in the past year. They constitute the bulk of foreign women coming for operations, with the rest being made up of patients from elsewhere in Europe or the United States. About 70 per cent of the women are after face-lifts or breast operations, but others come for nose operations or liposuction. </p> <p>Despite South Africa's international image often being associated with crime and declining standards in public services, South African plastic surgery is among the best in the world. 'At first glance people might think coming here might be like going to some place such as Ecuador or Brazil, but it is not like that. The standards here are exceptional,' said another Johannesburg-based plastic surgeon, Alastair Lamont. </p> <p>In part this has been created by a healthy local market.

      "bodyText": "They are calling them scalpel safaris. Hundreds of British women are flocking to South Africa to witness the delights of the country's wildlife - and arrive home looking years younger. Travel agents are marketing the joys of constant South African sunshine with the opportunity to have plastic surgery through special combined packages that cost a fraction of the price here. Surgeons and Safari will help patients organise a whole package of game viewing and plastic surgery. Clients are met at the airport and guided through every stage of the process for one week or a fortnight. It is already proving a success. Last week two British women from Guernsey, Diana Davison and Kathleen Rosenthal, were recovering after their surgery. Davison said they were looking forward to returning home looking a few years younger. 'I had an insurance policy payout and I didn't want a cruise. This just seemed a good idea,' said Davison, 65. For Perin Lewis, plastic surgery was not a matter of looking younger. It was just a desire to press the pause button on the ageing process. 'I just wanted to suspend the effects of gravity for a while,' said the 61-year-old Londoner. Everything is on offer in South Africa and the market is estimated to have quadrupled over the past two years as a result of foreign women - and a few men - taking advantage of low prices and well-trained surgeons. Lewis, who organises conference events from her Hampstead house, has no regrets about choosing to go to South Africa, where her daughter, a model, had already had several operations. 'It has been fantastic. I was so impressed,' said Lewis, who has had a face and eye lift. Lewis has recommended the treatment to dozens of her friends, 10 of whom have since followed her advice and headed south for an operation and a spot of game viewing. The result has been boom time in the spotless and ultra-modern clinics of Johannesburg and Cape Town. 'At first it spread just by word of mouth, mainly from people who had left South Africa to go and live in Britain and told their British friends about standards here. But now the demand is just exploding,' said Dr Saul Braun, who runs the Rosebank Clinic in Johannesburg and operated on Lewis and her friends. Braun believes he has operated on more than 130 British women in the past year. They constitute the bulk of foreign women coming for operations, with the rest being made up of patients from elsewhere in Europe or the United States. About 70 per cent of the women are after face-lifts or breast operations, but others come for nose operations or liposuction. Despite South Africa's international image often being associated with crime and declining standards in public services, South African plastic surgery is among the best in the world. 'At first glance people might think coming here might be like going to some place such as Ecuador or Brazil, but it is not like that. The standards here are exceptional,' said another Johannesburg-based plastic surgeon, Alastair Lamont. In part this has been created by a healthy local market. Like much of the United States - and unlike Britain - many wealthy South Africans, especially whites, see plastic surgery as a run-of-the-mill operation and nothing to try to hide or be ashamed of. Another of the main driving forces behind the boom in foreigners is economic. Due to the collapse of the rand, surgery in South Africa is very cheap. In Britain a face-lift could cost around \u00a39,000. In South Africa it will cost around \u00a33,200, and that includes flights, a two-week stay in a top hotel and meals in quality restaurants. Trips to the game reserves are optional, but most people will spend at least some time on safari. 'Why have a boob job in the UK, when you can have it done here, have a holiday, and still pay less. Essentially it is a first world service at third world prices,' said Dr Paul Skoll, a Cape Town-based plastic surgeon. Another advantage of combining a holiday in South Africa with a spell under the surgeon's knife is the opportunity to cover up the fact that the operation has been done. In Britain many patients are reluctant to admit they have been operated on and want to disguise their new youthful appearance as the product of a rejuvenating holiday in the sun.

      "body": "<p>Telling the truth about lies is dangerous in Britain. An MP may be a demonstrable liar, but if other MPs call him a liar the Speaker orders them to retract 'unparliamentary language' or be thrown out of Westminster. The rest of us are at once in a better and worse position. We are free to call a liar a liar, and for that we must be grateful. But while MPs can't be sued for what they say in the Commons, we can be ruined in the libel courts. </p> <p>Not the least of the many virtues of D.D. Guttenplan's The Holocaust on Trial (Granta Books \u00a317.99) is the struggle by an American author to get a grip on English law. As he dissects the David Irving libel case, you can almost hear him questioning lawyers: 'Let me see if I've got this straight. The defendants have to show that what they said was true? So they're guilty until proved innocent? No shit? And they can't argue they were honestly trying to get it right? Wow!' </p> <p>In the 1990s, Irving convinced many who ought to know better that he was a good historian being persecuted for exercising his freedom to speak and write freely. The heirs of Voltaire must have been disappointed when Irving showed that if you disagreed with what he said, he would litigate your right to say so to the death. He sued Penguin for publishing Denying the Holocaust by Deborah Lipstadt, an American academic. </p> <p>As Guttenplan puts it, Irving's complaint against Lipstadt was that: 'When [Irving] writes that Hitler had no knowledge of the Final Solution, or says that there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz, and that fewer people died there in four years than were killed in one night by the Allied bombing of Dresden, what he is doing is no different from... an archaeologist who doubts whether the Greeks and Trojans really went to war over Helen of Troy.' His claims that the death camps are a fiction are legitimate and to suggest otherwise is libellous. Nazism may yet be rehabilitated in part as one bloody but confused reaction among many to the terrors of the twentieth century. </p> <p>Irving admitted speaking at British National Party rallies and addressed the judge as 'Mein F\u00fchrer'. He asserted that it was 'a basic principle of English law' that Hitler, or 'Adolf' as he chummily called him, did not share the handicaps of the defendants and was 'innocent until proved guilty'. </p> <p>Mr Justice Gray delivered his verdict on 11 April last year. He concluded that Irving shared the political beliefs of the 'militant neo-Nazis', whose meetings he had graced. 'The content of his speeches and interviews often displays a distinctly pro-Nazi and anti-Jewish bias.' He wasn't an honest historian, struggling with the inevitable difficulties understanding the past brings, but a deliberate falsifier of the record, 'motivated by a desire to present events in a manner consistent with his own ideological beliefs even if that involved distortion and manipulation of historical evidence'. </p> <p>Well that's a relief, I thought at the time. Even in England you can criticise those who say there were no gassings at Auschwitz as nutters or fascists or both. </p> <p>Anthony Julius QC, one of the defence team, wasn't so much relieved as ecstatic. Gray's verdict was 'a sparkling vindication of the libel laws' which should silence opponents of the status quo. The 'fantastic result softens one's attitude to the courts and the litigation process... everything looks rosy'. </p> <p>Julius won because the professor of modern history at Cambridge had demolished Irving's scholarship. Richard J. Evans went through Irving's sources and produced an exhaustive 740-page analysis which detailed how Irving had twisted evidence in the Nazi interest. Irving had censored himself as well as the past by cutting references to death camps from his early work when it was reprinted. </p> <p>Evans has written a book on the affair - Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial. You are free to buy it in America and read the professor's account of the case and reflections on historical interpretation. I've no doubt it is a serious study. Evans is the author of In Defence of History, a patient critique of the wild subjectivity of postmodernist theory. You were meant to be free to read Lying About Hitler in Britain. But last week, Evans's publishers, Heinemann, a branch of the Random House conglomerate, ordered that the book should be pulped. </p> <p>Gray's verdict, which came after years of collecting evidence and months of cross-examination in an enormously expensive trial, might as well never have happened. Heinemann said they did not dare publish because Irving was appealing against Gray's ruling. In fact, Irving has been refused permission to appeal, and it is that decision he is contesting. In the very unlikely event of Irving winning and the Court of Appeal agreeing to consider Gray's condemnation, the crushing evidence against him should deny him victory. </p> <p>Granta Books certainly think so and snapped up Lying About Hitler . Granta didn't 'see any terrible legal nightmares' and was 'very enthusiastic and keen to publish'. We shall still be able to make up our own minds about Evans's writing. If the story stopped there, the moral of the censorship of Evans would merely be that robust authors should think hard before signing a contract with Random House. In January, nine months after Irving was demolished in the High Court, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson published The Hitler of History by John Lukacs. Americans had been able to read it for three years, but Irving warned he would sue if it appeared in Britain. Publication would have been a triumph for free speech over a bully if criticisms of Irving had not been bowdlerised. In the American version, Lukacs says 'many of Irving's references and quotations are not verifiable'. In the British edition enforced gentility has made that 'some of Irving's references and quotations are inaccurate'. </p> <p>Next month, Palgrave will publish Remembering for the Future, a collection of essays on the Holocaust edited by John K. Roth and Elisabeth Maxwell-Meynard. They had intended to include a piece on Irving, but they pulled back because of fears of libel. Elisabeth Maxwell-Meynard is the widow of Robert Maxwell. Judges and QCs allowed the old crook to use the libel laws to suppress disclosure of his numerous corruptions. I know it's a clich\u00e9 to say the law is 'beyond satire'. But I can't think of anything else to write. </p> <p>I should declare an interest and add that despite everything Irving is still threatening to sue The Observer. Even if he weren't, the ability of such a man to stifle debate would be chilling. It is not too fanciful to say that Irving is a symptom of a sickness which enfeebles the culture. On the rare moments when the media tear themselves away from the self-obsessed and the trivial to investigate, the libel laws produce a stilted discourse, afflicted with snideness and coyness, in which every speaker must pepper their sentences with 'seemses' and 'no one is suggesting thats', or give up. </p> <p>Libel is generally a rich man's game, so they're protected while it's open season on the working and middle classes. But libel isn't only about money. One of the reasons that politicians are objects of ridicule is that they very rarely sue. Business leaders cry 'libel' all the time. We are meant to be living in a world where power has passed from politicians to corporations, but libel law ensures that corporate power is barely examined. </p> <p>The media are big businesses themselves and so wariness of the courts combines with the self-interest of executives. At the BBC, to quote the most telling example, Greg Dyke, the new multi-millionaire director-general, assured an audience of corporate movers and thrusters that he wanted his reporters to be 'pro-business'. </p> <p>He proved himself as good as his word when he made Jeff Randall business editor of the BBC. Randall had come to Dyke's notice when he had attacked the Corporation for having an 'institutionalised bias against free-enterprise wealth-creators'. If Dyke had said he wanted to end the BBC's institutionalised bias against politicians, all hell would have broken loose. In this instance, no one raised an eyebrow. </p> <p>As in journalism, so in academia. Irving's opponents have been equally willing to use the courts. Daniel Goldhagen threatened to sue the Cambridge University Press when it considered publishing an assault by Norman Finkelstein and Ruth Birn of his thesis that Germans were psychopaths just waiting for their chance to slaughter the Jews. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the censorious head of Jewish America's Anti-Defamation League told the US publishers: 'The issue is not whether Goldhagen's thesis is right or wrong but what is legitimate criticism and what goes beyond the pale.' </p> <p>With so many writs flying around and books being pulped and censored, I might say that Anthony Julius was being a preposterous Pangloss when he said the 'sparkling' libel courts defend freedom of speech. But he'll probably sue, so I'd better shut up.</p>",

On the rare moments when the media tear themselves away from the self-obsessed and the trivial to investigate, the libel laws produce a stilted discourse, afflicted with snideness and coyness, in which every speaker must pepper their sentences with 'seemses' and 'no one is suggesting thats', or give up. Libel is generally a rich man's game, so they're protected while it's open season on the working and middle classes. But libel isn't only about money. One of the reasons that politicians are objects of ridicule is that they very rarely sue. Business leaders cry 'libel' all the time. We are meant to be living in a world where power has passed from politicians to corporations, but libel law ensures that corporate power is barely examined. The media are big businesses themselves and so wariness of the courts combines with the self-interest of executives. At the BBC, to quote the most telling example, Greg Dyke, the new multi-millionaire director-general, assured an audience of corporate movers and thrusters that he wanted his reporters to be 'pro-business'. He proved himself as good as his word when he made Jeff Randall business editor of the BBC. Randall had come to Dyke's notice when he had attacked the Corporation for having an 'institutionalised bias against free-enterprise wealth-creators'. If Dyke had said he wanted to end the BBC's institutionalised bias against politicians, all hell would have broken loose. In this instance, no one raised an eyebrow. As in journalism, so in academia. Irving's opponents have been equally willing to use the courts. Daniel Goldhagen threatened to sue the Cambridge University Press when it considered publishing an assault by Norman Finkelstein and Ruth Birn of his thesis that Germans were psychopaths just waiting for their chance to slaughter the Jews. Meanwhile, the censorious head of Jewish America's Anti-Defamation League told the US publishers: 'The issue is not whether Goldhagen's thesis is right or wrong but what is legitimate criticism and what goes beyond the pale.' With so many writs flying around and books being pulped and censored, I might say that Anthony Julius was being a preposterous Pangloss when he said the 'sparkling' libel courts defend freedom of speech. But he'll probably sue, so I'd better shut up.",

The rise in the number of children designated special needs - up more than 16 per cent in three years - has prompted fears of a rush to judge what may be normal variations in development. However, parents' groups argue the rise is mainly due to greater recognition of complex conditions such as attention deficit disorder or mild autism.

No, he's a wealthy pop icon. He's a shrewd marketer of 'art'. He knows about surrealism, I'd guess; it's almost there in some of his poems and songs. And, of course, the 'people' enjoy what he gives them, he is of the people! Once removed from the music, the lines have little rhythm. The timing is all wrong. And that's because the words aren't allowed to do the work themselves. That's what poetry is about, and that's why the song-lyric and the poem-lyric don't always operate in the same space. </p> <p>There is nothing remotely radical or challenging in this book. The cultural changes the Beatles helped facilitate (and I would place these firmly within the mainstream), worked within the processes of Cold War capitalism and were ultimately sanctioned by the so-called Establishment.

This is in keeping with the 'aware' McCartney promoted here; but the association of the black woman with the blackbird (as we learn in the introduction), the earth-mother biological determinism of a piece like 'Golden Earth Girl' - 'Golden earth girl, female animal/ Sings to the wind, resting at sunset/ In a mossy nest/ Sensing moonlight in the air/ Moonlight in the air' - are far from being sensitive to cultural and gender issues. </p> <p>Reading the song lyrics, you can't help singing them in your head, which detracts from the poetic experience in some way, where the language generates its own music, but saves them from the trough the non-song lyrics fall into: doggerel and sentiment. With the lyrics to 'Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band', you can see innovation, how the shifts in tonal register and almost strophe/anti-strophe play would work innovatively within the monotheisms of rock and roll, and get a sense that it even enlivens the frame of the page. But that's the extent of it. It scares me when I read that Mitchell had to convince McCartney to include the song lyrics; without them this would have been a travesty of a book. As it happens, it is an archival document and disembodied song-book of some interest. It is an artefact. </p> <p>I find it amusing that someone of the Left should have so consciously played the games of book construction he indirectly mocks in his introduction - the thematic arrangement and sequential-cum-symphonic shifts are nothing but pretentious. These sections are semi-thematic, but we feel the composer, editor (and author) are making grander gestures: 'Playing at Home', 'Yesterday', 'Friends and Enemies', 'The Business', 'The World Tonight', 'All the Lonely People' and so on. Social and environmental conscience is at work, but it often seems like lip-service. Despite the sincerity in a poem like 'Looking for Changes', against animal testing, many of the pieces lack genuine feeling. </p> <p>You can't hide bad art behind the term 'popular poetry'. And Mitchell's comparisons of McCartney to Blake and Burns are ludicrous - the lack of technical control over language and vernacular is evident even in the great song-lyrics; without the melody, they are strangely lifeless. McCartney, if he ever understood irony, did so in the lightest (but not delicate) of ways. 'Back in the USSR'; without the irony of the pumping jauntiness of the tune, it looks ridiculous, and the stuff from McCartney's post-Beatle years appears as linguistically inept as it is musically devoid. It may be a truism by now, but McCartney needed Lennon; they played through and against each other. </p> <p>The only reason I would encourage people to buy this book - and in some senses it's like a newly released (bad) Beatles song; it's gotta succeed - is not for appreciation of accomplishment, but in the hope Faber might put some of the profits into the rest of their poetry list and support further publications by the significant poets they carry.</p>",

      "body": "<p>An extraordinary day's cricket in Colombo, during which 22 wickets fell, ended with England winning a series on the sub-continent for the second time this winter. After bowling out Sri Lanka for 81 on a relatively blameless pitch, England, despite a few alarms, knocked off the 74 runs for victory with four wickets to spare. </p> <p>Every player contributed towards this brilliant victory - which took England to joint fourth in the world rankings - but the star was undoubtedly Surrey's Graham Thorpe, who chose to rest from last winter's tour of South Africa. He has returned to England colours refreshed and renewed though he admitted that he had 'never been so tired on a cricket field' as he was last night in the stifling heat of Colombo. </p> <p>Thorpe, undefeated on 113 was the mainstay of England's first innings, just as he was in the second when he shepherded his team home with an unbeaten 32. As he set off on his second innings of the day he felt 'dizzy and sick in the stomach. I've never played in such demanding conditions and maybe the tension added to the fatigue as well', he said afterwards. </p> <p>While England wobbled in pursuit of their victory target, their captain, Nasser Hussain, hobbled. 'My body's falling apart,' he said and it was announced yesterday that he would take no further part in the tour, missing the three one-day internationals. Hussain has a collection of groin, knee and thigh strains but there was no way he was not going to take to the field yesterday to oversee the clinical demolition of Sri Lanka's much-vaunted batting line up.</p> <p>Hussain regrets his early departure. 'I enjoy being with this team and the coach,' he said, reflecting the new spirit in the England set-up. Hardly surprising since Hussain is proving to be the most successful English captain since Mike Brearley, the last man to lead England to victory in four consecutive series. But discretion demands he should try to get himself fit for the summer when Pakistan visit England to be followed by a potentially enthralling clash with the Australians. This time there just might be a contest for the Ashes. </p> <p>Hussain pinpointed the victory in the second Test at Kandy as the crucial moment of the tour. 'After that win Darren Gough started talking about the win bonuses, Mike Atherton about winning four in a row.' Hussain said that 'there were 15 drained people in that dressing room' and stressed the need for his players to be given time to recuperate after their efforts this winter. Another heroes' welcome at Heathrow should be enough to soothe aching bodies and minds before the challenges of a fascinating summer, which could well prove to be a bonanza for the England Cricket Board. For once English cricket is sexy. The grounds will be packed with fans desperate to see the team continue their winning streak. </p> <p>'Ticket sales have been buoyant anyway for the forthcoming matches, especially for the Australians', said Terry Blake, marketing director of the ECB. 'We are heading for sellouts, at least in the Ashes, and the victory over Sri Lanka will help us fill the grounds against Pakistan as well. People just want to see this exciting team in action. 'The revival began last summer - remember we locked out 5,000 at The Oval for the last Test against the West Indies - and the two away wins this winter have added extra momentum.' </p> <p>Channel 4, which will broadcast all five Ashes Tests live, can't wait. 'We have a cricket team to be proud of for the first time in a long time. There's nothing like success to get people interested in the sport, particularly kids', said David Kerr, C4's editor of sport. 'The Ashes will have the best England team in years against the best team in the world in the greatest event in cricket. It's set up beautifully to be the sporting event of the summer.'

      "body": "<p>Hartlepool United, the butt of music-hall jokes for decades, set a new club record of 18 league matches undefeated with this draw in a match which was a sparkling advert for Division Three. </p> <p>The last time Hartlepool were beaten was back on 25 November, a run which has lifted them into fourth place. Things would look even brighter had the last five matches not ended in draws. But many here believe fourth will be enough to earn promotion for only the third time in their history, should the leaders Chesterfield be punished for financial irregularities. </p> <p>Strange things have been happening here in the North East. Earlier in the week Hartlepool had even been featured on the BBC Holiday programme. It seems that the only person here left for the music hall comedians to exploit is the town's local Labour MP. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson was among the crowd, leaving one club official to remark ruefully that there must be an election on the horizon. The opening exchanges must have seemed all very tedious to a man whose normal habitat is more usually the ballet or opera. This passion play was ignited in the 22nd minute by Brighton's Kerry Mayo, whose 25-yard shot left Hartlepool keeper Anthony Williams beaten - only for him to be saved by a post. Far from galvanising the out-of-sorts visitors, it was the home side who drew inspiration. </p> <p>Directed by Paul Stephenson, a former Newcastle team-mate of Paul Gascoigne, they went close on three occasions in four minutes. First, in the 29th minute, Tony Lormor saw a shot from six yards blocked by Michel Kuipers, a save the Brighton keeper repeated minutes later from the same player. </p> <p>Confidence rising, Hartlepool fell victim in the 36th minute to a well-worked Brighton corner.

      "bodyText": "Hartlepool United, the butt of music-hall jokes for decades, set a new club record of 18 league matches undefeated with this draw in a match which was a sparkling advert for Division Three. The last time Hartlepool were beaten was back on 25 November, a run which has lifted them into fourth place. Things would look even brighter had the last five matches not ended in draws. But many here believe fourth will be enough to earn promotion for only the third time in their history, should the leaders Chesterfield be punished for financial irregularities. Strange things have been happening here in the North East. Earlier in the week Hartlepool had even been featured on the BBC Holiday programme. It seems that the only person here left for the music hall comedians to exploit is the town's local Labour MP. Peter Mandelson was among the crowd, leaving one club official to remark ruefully that there must be an election on the horizon. The opening exchanges must have seemed all very tedious to a man whose normal habitat is more usually the ballet or opera. This passion play was ignited in the 22nd minute by Brighton's Kerry Mayo, whose 25-yard shot left Hartlepool keeper Anthony Williams beaten - only for him to be saved by a post. Far from galvanising the out-of-sorts visitors, it was the home side who drew inspiration. Directed by Paul Stephenson, a former Newcastle team-mate of Paul Gascoigne, they went close on three occasions in four minutes. First, in the 29th minute, Tony Lormor saw a shot from six yards blocked by Michel Kuipers, a save the Brighton keeper repeated minutes later from the same player. Confidence rising, Hartlepool fell victim in the 36th minute to a well-worked Brighton corner. Paul Watson rolled the ball into the path of Richard Carpenter, whose crisp, rising drive arrowed beyond Williams to put his side ahead. It took less than a minute after the break for Hartlepool to equalise when Lormor headed Stephenson's corner beyond Kuipers. Kevin Hen derson should have put them in front in the 54th minute when he was left unmarked but headed straight at the keeper. Seconds later, at the other end, Michael Barron was harshly penalised for handling after Bobby Zamora fired at him from close range. Zamora converted the penalty himself for his 22nd goal of the season. To their credit, Hartlepool kept their cool and brought themselves level again straight from the restart - Henderson running through to shoot low into the net. But Pool, try as they might, couldn't find the winner they craved and deserved.",

      "bodyText": "George Graham has gone - and the Spurs go marching on. Tottenham swept to a comfortable victory over an increasingly relegation-haunted Coventry City to banish any doubts that the timing of George Graham's dismissal as manager might upset Spurs' rhythm. In fact it seems to have had the opposite effect, with Spurs playing some of their best football of the season under caretaker David Pleat as they swept to an easy win thanks to goals from Stefan Iversen, Les Ferdinand and Sergei Rebrov. With all the brouhaha around White Hart Lane over the sacking of Graham one could almost be forgiven for forgetting an important game was at stake. Coventry are fighting for their lives and Spurs sorely needed of a couple of victories to ease their nerves ahead of the FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal, the game that will make or break their season.

      "body": "<p>Years ago, when I was still a baby wine writer, someone tried to bribe me. This being the wine trade, where these things are done with comparative subtlety, there were no Neil Hamilton-style brown-paper bags involved. No one offered to show me the inside of a broom cupboard at Nobu or told me that I should consider spending an all-expenses weekend in the Maldives. All they did was give me a case of wine. </p> <p>A what, you're probably thinking? He must need one of those like a bullet in the pre-frontal cortex. And you're quite right. As a wine writer, I get sent so many free samples that if I didn't regularly open the boxes that pile up outside my door, The Observer would have to send in the St Bernards before long. There is wine and wine, however, and the point about this particular case was that it was special.</p> <p>Researching an article on De Luxe Cuv\u00e9e Champagnes, I'd asked for a sample of a well-known and very expensive fizz. Instead of a bottle, the importer sent me a case. Thinking they'd made a mistake, I called to point out the error. 'We thought you deserved a case,' came the reply. Needless to say, he picked up the remaining 11 bottles the next day.</p> <p>Why bring this up now? The reason is that ethics, and more specifically conflicts of interest, are the subject of ferocious debate in wine-writing circles at the moment. My counterpart on The Times, Jane MacQuitty, was the first to point the finger, claiming that 'there's a lot of bad plonk out there, but cosy trade deals stop you reading about it'. In particular, she put the steel toecaps into Malcolm Gluck of The Guardian, who has blended a very ordinary wine, Superplonk, which sells in Tesco. The debate has rumbled on for months.</p> <p>I shall not comment on Ms MacQuitty's allegations other than to say that Mr Gluck is a hard-working and extremely professional hack who takes his job and his readers very seriously. I don't always agree with his palate, but wine is a subjective business and it would be boring if we all recommended the same bottles. I could say the same about some of Ms MacQuitty's choices.</p> <p>Is British wine writing riddled with corruption? Are there people with their noses in the trough, or possibly spittoon? I honestly believe not, especially if you look at what goes on in producing countries such as France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and even Australia, where hacks are expected to cheer for the home team. The diverse origins of the wines we see in the UK means that we are free to speak our minds.</p> <p>I won't deny that we lead enviable lives: free trips, nice hotels, good food and wine. No wonder a producer friend of mine says he believes in reincarnation and wants to come back as a wine hack next time. Does this influence what we write? As far as I'm concerned, it does not, never has done and never will do. But, as Mandy Rice-Davis once put it, I would say that, wouldn't I?</p> <p>The only test of a wine writer's integrity is the bottles that he or she recommends from the thousands tasted each year. That and the tone and subject matter covered in their columns. If you don't like what I tell you to drink, I hope you'll let me know. As Americans like to say, I'd like to think we have a relationship going here.</p> <p><strong>Best cellars: Five wines that won't let you down at a dinner party</strong></p> <p><strong> 1998 Landskroon Shiraz, Paarl </strong> (\u00a36.49, Safeway).<br> The quality of the red wines emerging from South Africa never ceases to surprise me. Gone are the baked, rather unyielding flavours of the past, to be replaced by something softer and more appealing. This peppery, blackberry and cherry-fruity, winningly oaked Shiraz is a brilliant buy at under \u00a36.50. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Yalumba Bush Vine Grenache, Barossa Valley </strong> (\u00a37.99, Thresher, Victoria Wine, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up).<br> Old bush vine Grenache is one of Australia's great secrets. Just plunge your nostrils into this broad, richly fruity, violet-scented red, with its flavours of raspberries, wild strawberries and sweet oak and you'll see what I mean. A wine that puts a smile on your face and sends you skipping out into the street. </p> <p><strong> 2000 Palliser Estate Sauvignon Blanc </strong> (\u00a39.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up).<br> A Martinborough Sauvignon Blanc that is always among the best in New Zealand, this ripe, full-bodied, guava, gooseberry and passion-fruity white has real intensity, poise and class. One of the white wines of the vintage in the North Island, this would be perfect with sea bass or monkfish. </p> <p><strong> 1996 Palacio de Otazu, Navarra Reserva </strong> (\u00a39.99, Waitrose).<br> The prices of the best Riojas have got so silly of late that people are beginning to look to neighbouring Navarra for alternatives. If so, this stylish, oak-aged, vanilla and cassis-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and a little Tempranillo really delivers the goods. Like a cross between a Rioja and a fine Bordeaux. </p> <p><strong> 1998 San Fereolo, Dolcetto di Dogliani </strong> (\u00a38.99, Oddbins).<br> Dolcetto is sometimes regarded as an inferior grape in the Piedmont region. This example, produced from low-yielding old vines in the commune of Dogliani is a dark, comparatively well-structured red with layers of plum, black cherry and damson fruit and firmish tannins. Great with cheese or a stew.</p>",

No one offered to show me the inside of a broom cupboard at Nobu or told me that I should consider spending an all-expenses weekend in the Maldives. All they did was give me a case of wine. A what, you're probably thinking? He must need one of those like a bullet in the pre-frontal cortex. And you're quite right. As a wine writer, I get sent so many free samples that if I didn't regularly open the boxes that pile up outside my door, The Observer would have to send in the St Bernards before long. There is wine and wine, however, and the point about this particular case was that it was special. Researching an article on De Luxe Cuv\u00e9e Champagnes, I'd asked for a sample of a well-known and very expensive fizz. Instead of a bottle, the importer sent me a case. Thinking they'd made a mistake, I called to point out the error. 'We thought you deserved a case,' came the reply. Needless to say, he picked up the remaining 11 bottles the next day. Why bring this up now? The reason is that ethics, and more specifically conflicts of interest, are the subject of ferocious debate in wine-writing circles at the moment. My counterpart on The Times, Jane MacQuitty, was the first to point the finger, claiming that 'there's a lot of bad plonk out there, but cosy trade deals stop you reading about it'. In particular, she put the steel toecaps into Malcolm Gluck of The Guardian, who has blended a very ordinary wine, Superplonk, which sells in Tesco. The debate has rumbled on for months. I shall not comment on Ms MacQuitty's allegations other than to say that Mr Gluck is a hard-working and extremely professional hack who takes his job and his readers very seriously. I don't always agree with his palate, but wine is a subjective business and it would be boring if we all recommended the same bottles. I could say the same about some of Ms MacQuitty's choices. Is British wine writing riddled with corruption? Are there people with their noses in the trough, or possibly spittoon? I honestly believe not, especially if you look at what goes on in producing countries such as France, Spain, Italy, Portugal and even Australia, where hacks are expected to cheer for the home team. The diverse origins of the wines we see in the UK means that we are free to speak our minds. I won't deny that we lead enviable lives: free trips, nice hotels, good food and wine. No wonder a producer friend of mine says he believes in reincarnation and wants to come back as a wine hack next time. Does this influence what we write? As far as I'm concerned, it does not, never has done and never will do. But, as Mandy Rice-Davis once put it, I would say that, wouldn't I? The only test of a wine writer's integrity is the bottles that he or she recommends from the thousands tasted each year. That and the tone and subject matter covered in their columns. If you don't like what I tell you to drink, I hope you'll let me know. As Americans like to say, I'd like to think we have a relationship going here. Best cellars: Five wines that won't let you down at a dinner party 1998 Landskroon Shiraz, Paarl (\u00a36.49, Safeway). The quality of the red wines emerging from South Africa never ceases to surprise me. Gone are the baked, rather unyielding flavours of the past, to be replaced by something softer and more appealing. This peppery, blackberry and cherry-fruity, winningly oaked Shiraz is a brilliant buy at under \u00a36.50. 1998 Yalumba Bush Vine Grenache, Barossa Valley (\u00a37.99, Thresher, Victoria Wine, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up). Old bush vine Grenache is one of Australia's great secrets. Just plunge your nostrils into this broad, richly fruity, violet-scented red, with its flavours of raspberries, wild strawberries and sweet oak and you'll see what I mean. A wine that puts a smile on your face and sends you skipping out into the street. 2000 Palliser Estate Sauvignon Blanc (\u00a39.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up). A Martinborough Sauvignon Blanc that is always among the best in New Zealand, this ripe, full-bodied, guava, gooseberry and passion-fruity white has real intensity, poise and class. One of the white wines of the vintage in the North Island, this would be perfect with sea bass or monkfish. 1996 Palacio de Otazu, Navarra Reserva (\u00a39.99, Waitrose). The prices of the best Riojas have got so silly of late that people are beginning to look to neighbouring Navarra for alternatives. If so, this stylish, oak-aged, vanilla and cassis-style blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and a little Tempranillo really delivers the goods. Like a cross between a Rioja and a fine Bordeaux. 1998 San Fereolo, Dolcetto di Dogliani (\u00a38.99, Oddbins). Dolcetto is sometimes regarded as an inferior grape in the Piedmont region. This example, produced from low-yielding old vines in the commune of Dogliani is a dark, comparatively well-structured red with layers of plum, black cherry and damson fruit and firmish tannins. Great with cheese or a stew.",

Joseph Clarke slams the door of his parents' suburban home near Croydon, heading down the road, anorak over blazer, rucksack on his back, to catch his coach to school.</p> <p>An hour later the coach turns into College Road, Dulwich, and lines up with four-wheel drives waiting for the barrier to lift so they can deposit boys in front of the vast terracotta pile of Dulwich College. Past the rollers on the playing fields, other boys troop across from boarding houses. A master in a gown is standing waiting to shepherd boys across the road, pausing to smile at mothers in Burberry macs who are hauling violins out of boots. Joseph now streams off with the others into the school cloisters where Ernest Shackleton's boat is on display, and, putting his rucksack into his locker, he pulls his chair up under his desk and awaits morning roll.</p> <p>The P13 bus also carries boys into school and it too stops outside the Dulwich College gates, though the schoolchildren on the P13 don't get out here. Most don't even glance out of the window. Kenneth During comes this way from his home in Peckham, but doesn't notice the Dulwich boys as he prepares instead to descend a short distance further on. Then walking up beside the railway tracks, Kenneth turns through a gap in the railings, where a sign, half-obscured by graffiti, says Kingsdale School. The prefab blocks are patrolled by 'inclusion officers' in navy uniforms, and CCTV cameras are positioned over dank stairwells. Boys are kicking footballs around on the patches of concrete. The children here have no form rooms to go to while they wait for classes; no desks to call their own. Not even a locker to store belongings - Kenneth will heave his rucksack around with him all day.</p> <p>Nowhere is Britain's educational divide drawn more starkly than in this London suburb. The biggest independent school in the country, which selects boys from the brightest 20 per cent and spends almost \u00a38,000 a year on each pupil, sits alongside a state school which takes anyone who turns up and spends \u00a32,000 a year on its pupils. Dulwich College ensures that 95 per cent of its pupils get A-C passes at GCSE and sends 95 per cent of sixth-formers to top universities - 12 or so pupils go to Oxbridge each year. Kingsdale gets 15 per cent of its pupils through GCSE with five A-C grades and doesn't know how many go to university as it has no sixth form. One school takes up two columns in the top schools guide, the other is still recovering from an Ofsted ruling three years ago that it was 'failing'.</p> <p>In affluent Dulwich, where private education flourishes on the edge of one of London's poorest boroughs, the contrast here is not just between these neighbouring schools, but between two groups of teenagers living in entirely different worlds. They hardly ever meet. Their timetables are even staggered to try and keep them apart in case the meetings are violent.</p> <p>The school day is about to begin. In the Dulwich College drama school a small group of 12-year-old Prosperos and Calibans are sitting in a circle, considering this question: 'Will educating Caliban make him a happier person?'</p> <p>The college educates a dozen or so poor boys in any one year by offering bursaries to bright state-school pupils - a tradition going back to the college's foundation by Elizabethan actor-manager Edward Alleyn as a school for 'twelve poor scholars'. Dulwich old boy Sir Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, went there on a bursary.</p> <p>In a religious education class, 13-year-olds are talking about the meaning of the word incarnation and wondering: 'Why does a good God allow suffering?' Small hands, white, black and brown, shoot up; 30 per cent of the college intake is from ethnic minorities. So Graham Able, master of the college, can present the Dulwich as a school with a social conscience, and certainly not the white man's ghetto that it used to be in Shackleton's day. 'It reflects the racial mix of London,' he says. Indeed listening to Able (Worksop and Cambridge) sitting in his study under the campanile, one could almost dream that this is a model of egalitarianism. And, momentarily, Peckham seems a million miles away.</p> <p>Until recently, Dulwich College boys and staff were unlikely to come across pupils from its neighbouring state school. The Kingsdale intake was traditionally from the west of the borough and from Lambeth, which meant there was no need for children arriving at its gates to come past the college to its east. Then, another comprehensive, Dulwich High School, with a large intake from Peckham to the north-east, was closed. Its boys were sent to Kingsdale, and to get there they had to pass close to Dulwich College.</p> <p>Mixing the rival Peckham boys with Brixton boys not only brought gang friction into Kingsdale, it also brought clashes with the private-school kids. Those who hadn't noticed Kingsdale before now began to see it as a place to fear. 'They just see us as privileged rich toffs and they hate us. We see them as mostly black, mostly petty criminals,' says one Dulwich boy.</p> <p>'They are just as likely to be the trouble-makers,' says Steven Morrison, headteacher at Kingsdale, who sits in front of a CCTV camera trained on his car. 'We get calls from shopkeepers complaining about our boys and it's often them. They take their ties off and look just the same.' His view is supported by pupil Kenneth. 'They wear the same uniform as us. People mix us up. If there's trouble, people would rather blame us,' he says.</p> <p>It is mid-morning at Kingsdale School and a Tannoy blares out into the music room and the drama block as well as every class and every examination room, telling children missing from an exam to hurry there. Mary Graham, head of music here for 28 years, has been rehearsing pupils for a concert of soul music in memory of Damilola Taylor, the primary schoolboy murdered last November on the North Peckham estate. Her stars will all be there. Kenneth, 15, has reached grade six on the trumpet in only three years.</p> <p>Graham has high hopes of her pupils who are taking GCSEs this year. Some years 100 per cent have got A-C grades in music. The school has steel bands, soul bands, jazz bands, a guitar ensemble and a percussion ensemble.</p> <p>In the teaching block, four new boys who have arrived at the school from countries in Africa are being assigned to special English lessons. Three weeks into the term, and with only 15 weeks to go before the exams, these boys will be placed in GCSE classes. As many as 400 pupils, many refugees and many without English as a first language, join classes at Kingsdale midway through a term. Omar, just arrived from Sierra Leone, prefers to speak in French. He came here because of 'la guerre'. Currently the school has 40 Kosovan refugees. 'They want to stay and finish their education here rather than return home,' says Devon Hanson, a head of year at Kingsdale, with pride.</p> <p>The new boys chat to each other about the school. The toilets are 'odorous' says one. Some of the pupils are 'very rude' says another. 'I feel sorry for the teachers. The pupils would not be able to behave like that in my country.' But the boys, in crisp, white shirts and new ties, are eager and listen for words of encouragement. Behind Hanson's desk is a diagram showing staff how they should motivate pupils and raise achievement. Nearby is a poem about self-esteem and a poster of Martin Luther King. 'You will not get eight or nine GCSEs but you will get some. It will not be easy but it can be done,' says Hanson.</p> <p>Tunde Jussef, a school prefect whose family came to the UK from Nigeria when he was two, has come to guide the new boys on to their next class. 'Here is a boy who has done well,' says Hanson. 'We would never have thought you would be doing five GCSEs when you arrived.' Hanson, a Jamaican, says that teachers in state schools have to know their subject and be able to motivate kids who are not motivated because of the failure all around them. 'These are kids who might have been woken up by the police banging at the flat next door to ask about the murder,' he says, referring to the Damilola case.</p> <p>'It is not the teachers who have low expectations of these children but the system itself,' he adds. 'There is pressure on us to push these kids to vocational exams, not A-levels. Ask Dulwich College how many vocational exams their children do?' I do, and Able says: 'None.' In fact, he would clearly rather not have to bother his boys with GCSEs. 'A lot of mundane material. Not inspirational. Here, we are educating boys towards A-level from the moment they arrive.'</p> <p>Able says his teachers are from a 'different pool'. They have 'tremendous admiration' for colleagues in the state-school sector but they do a different job. At Dulwich there is an enthusiasm for know'edge but in some inner-city state schools children don't want to learn, he says. \u00efIf academic standards are not seen to be important by the pupils or the parent body there may be an ethos against learning in the playground.'</p> <p>When Kingsdale opened in 1958 the school was hailed as one of London's new utopian comprehensives where children of all abilities would learn, and where 'nobody would be allowed to feel a failure'. Pastoral care was to be administered through a system of houses and form teachers. Three decades later every pupil in the same school was made to feel a failure thanks to Ofsted, which in 1998 paraded Kingsdale as a failing school, putting it on 'special measures' - a euphemism for collective punishment.</p> <p>But Kingsdale had failed to achieve the impossible. A school designed to take the 'full range of ability' in order that pupils could learn from their peers - the driving idea behind the comprehensive - found that by the Eighties it was taking only pupils from the poorest, most disadvantaged homes. The school became known as a recruiting ground for local gangs: the Brixton Boys, the Dulwich Crew and, more lately, the YPB (Young Peckham Boys). Middle-class parents fled from the school en masse. Girls simply stopped coming (boys now outnumber girls by four to one).</p> <p>Soon the only parents who 'selected' Kingsdale were those whose children had either been excluded from all other schools or parents who lived near schools whose reputations they thought were worse. They include Abbey and Ola Jussef, Tunde's parents, who live on the edge of the North Peckham estate. 'I didn't want my son to go to the schools near here,' says Abbey, who works as a catering manager at Ofsted's London offices. She says the inspectors she met at work advised her to send her son to Kingsdale. 'It is a very good school. I want the very best for Tunde. I even bought him a computer,' she says.</p> <p>So whose fault was Kingsdale's 'failure'? The fault of governments for failing to see the very special needs of inner-city schools; for luring away the brighter kids with assisted places and other better choices? The fault of the media for sensationalising the fights, the knives, the CS gas? The fault of the LEA who sold off playing fields, decapitated the school by removing its sixth form, and then dumped upon it an entire cohort of disadvantaged boys - 150 of them - salvaged from the wreck of another 'failing' school, Dulwich High?</p> <p>Or was it the fault of kids such as Dom (excluded from Kingsdale for fighting); Sue (excluded and pregnant at 14); or Carl (excluded for assaulting a teacher). Carl could have told Ofsted a lot about failure. Excluded from one school after putting another boy's face through a car windscreen for being rude about his mother, he went to Dulwich High, where he started to settle well. 'I was good there. I was good at geography.' But then the school was closed and he was moved on with the rest of his friends to Kingsdale. One day, he says, a teacher asked him to take his hat off. He was angry and beat the teacher. 'That's one thing I regret,' says Carl. 'That teacher - he never recovered.'</p> <p>'Carl is doing well now,' says Camilla Batmanjehda, of Kids Company, a centre where the 16-year-old has been given therapeutic help and intensive teaching. 'The schools don't know what to do with children like this. They are treated like a herd and they react against it.'</p> <p>Sitting now in a Burberry sweatshirt, Carl remembers how the Dulwich locals used to cross over the street when they saw 'us black boys - us Peckham boys'. And he remembers once straying down an alley and looking through a line of trees towards another school close to his. \u00efIt was big, yeah, as big as you can imagine. Lots of grass and trees all over. Massive, that building was. I used to go and stare at the girls there. They used to come out at lunchtime and sit under the trees. They talked to me sometimes. We got along OK. I liked going there.'</p> <p>Carl had stumbled over the boundary of James Allens Girls' School (JAGS) another jewel in Dulwich's private school crown.</p> <p>Now the classes at Kingsdale are breaking up for lunch and pupils are thundering out of doors, down corridors so narrow their sides can be touched by outstretched teenage arms. In the dining hall some will eat standing as there are not enough seats for all.</p> <p>Dulwich College has three dining rooms and today the menus are: chicken chasseur, beef goulash with stuffed peppers or lamb rogan josh. At the high table are Charlie, Adam, Imre, Dipesh, Simon, Russell and Joseph. Most are prefects and wear striped blazers, showing they have their school colours. All are going to university, several to Oxford or Cambridge. Joseph hopes to read maths at Trinity Hall.</p> <p>All the boys say they are proud to be here and would never have achieved half as much if they had gone to state schools. 'It's the people you meet as much as anything,' says Charlie Butcher, captain of rugby.</p> <p>Do they meet state-school kids ever? 'No.' Do they play sport against Kingsdale? 'No.' Do they play any music together, share facilities or teachers? Not that they know of. But there is no 'class division' say the boys. 'We may be a public school but we are all south Londoners.' Muggings have usually been over mobile phones - not about who is at what school, says their headmaster.</p> <p>Asked about the violence, however, the boys seem uncomfortable. Charlie says a friend was recently stabbed. Imre, captain of hockey and cricket, was attacked. 'It was my own fault, I had not covered up my colours,' he says. And younger boys had been picked on when they were out alone, they say. Things have been better since CCTV was installed at the stations but they have had to stop using the one at Sydenham Hill. The boys largely stay on the school premises at lunch break. They have their own 'commissariat' where they can get their mobile phone top-ups, and they can read newspapers or play chess in the Wodehouse library, where Bertie Wooster himself might have made himself at home, reading the papers in an armchair.</p> <p>Joseph, who plays clarinet and saxophone and runs his own barber-shop choir, rehearses at lunchtime in the music school. 'I am very proud to be here. My parents have given up a lot. No foreign holidays. We don't get what some other kids get. They could only afford to buy us a computer last year.'</p> <p>Ian Clarke, Joseph's father, says there was no going back to 'bog-standard comprehensives' once he had seen what the private schools had to offer. 'We remortgaged the house,' says Clarke, an actuary with an insurance company. He read maths at Oxford. Both he and his wife, Caroline, went to grammar schools and educated their first two children in the state system, but a third son, a talented child, needed extra attention. Sitting in their small front room dominated by a piano and the complete Encyclopaedia Britannica, they relive the moment they first saw a private school. 'It was incredible. You can't believe it at first. It's another world,' says Caroline. 'I think it's the way they value every child. Everyone is included somehow - even if they are not very good at something, they encourage them to do it. Joseph got into the fourth rugby team. We thought he was no good at French but he got an A-star.'</p> <p>Kingsdale's library is at the top of concrete steps, daubed with red arrows, directing pupils up and down. Morrison introduced the arrows - and the lines along the corridors - to stop pupils crashing into one another, which has helped restore discipline. 'How can children be expected to be civilised when the building itself encourages poor behaviour,' he asks. 'When there are six different options for getting from A to B; when there are 10 entrances and exits; when there are four classroom doors within the space of 50 feet opening onto 5ft-wide corridors; when you can\u00cdt hear what anyone says because there's no sound-proofing?' When, as a headteacher, you have to spend time drawing lines on the floor, he might have added. Morrison took over as head after the Ofsted report and has already improved results, leading to the removal of 'special measures'. But he, along with everyone else here, is still smarting from the criticism. Outside Morrison's office an honours board for the brightest and the best is tucked away next to dusty trophies from years ago and a faded certificate for food hygiene from Southwark Council.</p> <p>But here are the brightest and the best now, around the table in the library: Guyson, Wendy, Alex, Freedom, Nicola, Bemmy, Kenneth and Tunde, all talking of a brighter, better future. Bemmy and Nicola have even taken GCSEs early, and passed with As and Bs. 'The school is improving all the time. I am proud to be here,' says Guyson, who is taking a lead part in a forthcoming production of Grease. 'You hear them talking in the streets about us. Everyone says it. They think the children get bullied here. But that's just a stereotype. They don't know what goes on here at all.'</p> <p>The school has things to boast about. Its football team won the London cup three years ago. It has produced singers such as Karen Wheeler of Soul II Soul and jazz vocalist Gail Thomson. Do the teenagers know anyone from Dulwich College? Nicola says she once knew a boy who went there. 'He told me how they used to stick up a finger when they saw Kingsdale kids just to provoke us,' and she demonstrates. \u00efIt was their laugh of the day,' she says, bitterly. But mostly they don\u00cdt draw comparison with their neighbours: 'The only difference I can see between what they have and we have is the money - they have the money.'</p> <p>Guyson says: 'There is no difference. We have the same standards, the same talent to follow it through.' The pupils are all going on to sixth-form college. Some will do A-levels - computer studies, graphic design, media studies are mentioned. Some will do vocational exams. Tunde is going to college to do a BTEC in media studies - if he gets five GCSEs above grade C. Then, he says, he will go to university. He has a talent for graphics. The teenagers at Kingsdale have another reason to look forward. The school is about to undergo a \u00a37.5 million redesign. It is an experimental project, which could be a model for other schools. Architects and anthropologists have drawn up plans which will end what they describe as the culture of 'custodial containment' making it a 'hub of learning' in the community.</p> <p>Classrooms will be rearranged to promote rather than hinder learning. 'Does maths have to be taught in a classroom at all?' asks one of the planners, who have thought of everything from bright toilet paper to a new house system, ensuring better pastoral care.</p> <p>There are those in the LEA who believe a revamped Kingsdale might one day compete with Dulwich College for pupils. The children themselves ask less from the new make-over. Just new chairs would be good, says Guyson 'so my knees don't bang into the desk'. They would like somewhere to meet and relax and more room to eat. 'Lockers,' says Tunde.</p> <p>But not everyone is as optimistic for Kingsdale\u00cds future as the school planners. Even as the redesign gets under way, Southwark LEA has found a new way of depriving Kingsdale of a more balanced intake. Close by, a different kind of 'model school', known as the Charter School, has been opened. The Charter School was once known as Dulwich High School (which was once known as William Penn). Not only has Dulwich High been redesigned and given a new name, it has also been given a brand new set of hand-picked children, and is already hoovering up the privileged middle-class kids who might go to state schools. At Dulwich College, Able looks bemused by the suggestion that he may face competition from the state sector: he is looking forward next year to his biggest ever intake into the school. 'It is simply not possible to provide the education we offer with the money the state currently provides in the maintained sector.'</p> <p>It is the end of the school day and the coaches are lining up again to take college pupils home. Kingsdale pupils have already left. There have been occasional glimmers of real interest in each other's worlds. 'What did they say about us?' asks Morrison. And occasional glimmers of understanding. 'Talent can always be brought out,' says Able.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's a drizzly Monday morning. Joseph Clarke slams the door of his parents' suburban home near Croydon, heading down the road, anorak over blazer, rucksack on his back, to catch his coach to school. An hour later the coach turns into College Road, Dulwich, and lines up with four-wheel drives waiting for the barrier to lift so they can deposit boys in front of the vast terracotta pile of Dulwich College. Past the rollers on the playing fields, other boys troop across from boarding houses. A master in a gown is standing waiting to shepherd boys across the road, pausing to smile at mothers in Burberry macs who are hauling violins out of boots. Joseph now streams off with the others into the school cloisters where Ernest Shackleton's boat is on display, and, putting his rucksack into his locker, he pulls his chair up under his desk and awaits morning roll. The P13 bus also carries boys into school and it too stops outside the Dulwich College gates, though the schoolchildren on the P13 don't get out here. Most don't even glance out of the window. Kenneth During comes this way from his home in Peckham, but doesn't notice the Dulwich boys as he prepares instead to descend a short distance further on. Then walking up beside the railway tracks, Kenneth turns through a gap in the railings, where a sign, half-obscured by graffiti, says Kingsdale School. The prefab blocks are patrolled by 'inclusion officers' in navy uniforms, and CCTV cameras are positioned over dank stairwells. Boys are kicking footballs around on the patches of concrete. The children here have no form rooms to go to while they wait for classes; no desks to call their own. Not even a locker to store belongings - Kenneth will heave his rucksack around with him all day.

Dulwich College has three dining rooms and today the menus are: chicken chasseur, beef goulash with stuffed peppers or lamb rogan josh. At the high table are Charlie, Adam, Imre, Dipesh, Simon, Russell and Joseph. Most are prefects and wear striped blazers, showing they have their school colours. All are going to university, several to Oxford or Cambridge. Joseph hopes to read maths at Trinity Hall. All the boys say they are proud to be here and would never have achieved half as much if they had gone to state schools. 'It's the people you meet as much as anything,' says Charlie Butcher, captain of rugby. Do they meet state-school kids ever? 'No.' Do they play sport against Kingsdale? 'No.' Do they play any music together, share facilities or teachers? Not that they know of. But there is no 'class division' say the boys. 'We may be a public school but we are all south Londoners.' Muggings have usually been over mobile phones - not about who is at what school, says their headmaster. Asked about the violence, however, the boys seem uncomfortable. Charlie says a friend was recently stabbed. Imre, captain of hockey and cricket, was attacked. 'It was my own fault, I had not covered up my colours,' he says. And younger boys had been picked on when they were out alone, they say. Things have been better since CCTV was installed at the stations but they have had to stop using the one at Sydenham Hill. The boys largely stay on the school premises at lunch break. They have their own 'commissariat' where they can get their mobile phone top-ups, and they can read newspapers or play chess in the Wodehouse library, where Bertie Wooster himself might have made himself at home, reading the papers in an armchair. Joseph, who plays clarinet and saxophone and runs his own barber-shop choir, rehearses at lunchtime in the music school. 'I am very proud to be here. My parents have given up a lot. No foreign holidays. We don't get what some other kids get. They could only afford to buy us a computer last year.' Ian Clarke, Joseph's father, says there was no going back to 'bog-standard comprehensives' once he had seen what the private schools had to offer. 'We remortgaged the house,' says Clarke, an actuary with an insurance company. He read maths at Oxford. Both he and his wife, Caroline, went to grammar schools and educated their first two children in the state system, but a third son, a talented child, needed extra attention. Sitting in their small front room dominated by a piano and the complete Encyclopaedia Britannica, they relive the moment they first saw a private school. 'It was incredible. You can't believe it at first. It's another world,' says Caroline. 'I think it's the way they value every child. Everyone is included somehow - even if they are not very good at something, they encourage them to do it. Joseph got into the fourth rugby team. We thought he was no good at French but he got an A-star.' Kingsdale's library is at the top of concrete steps, daubed with red arrows, directing pupils up and down. Morrison introduced the arrows - and the lines along the corridors - to stop pupils crashing into one another, which has helped restore discipline. 'How can children be expected to be civilised when the building itself encourages poor behaviour,' he asks. 'When there are six different options for getting from A to B; when there are 10 entrances and exits; when there are four classroom doors within the space of 50 feet opening onto 5ft-wide corridors; when you can\u00cdt hear what anyone says because there's no sound-proofing?' When, as a headteacher, you have to spend time drawing lines on the floor, he might have added. Morrison took over as head after the Ofsted report and has already improved results, leading to the removal of 'special measures'. But he, along with everyone else here, is still smarting from the criticism. Outside Morrison's office an honours board for the brightest and the best is tucked away next to dusty trophies from years ago and a faded certificate for food hygiene from Southwark Council. But here are the brightest and the best now, around the table in the library: Guyson, Wendy, Alex, Freedom, Nicola, Bemmy, Kenneth and Tunde, all talking of a brighter, better future. Bemmy and Nicola have even taken GCSEs early, and passed with As and Bs. 'The school is improving all the time. I am proud to be here,' says Guyson, who is taking a lead part in a forthcoming production of Grease. 'You hear them talking in the streets about us. Everyone says it. They think the children get bullied here. But that's just a stereotype. They don't know what goes on here at all.' The school has things to boast about. Its football team won the London cup three years ago. It has produced singers such as Karen Wheeler of Soul II Soul and jazz vocalist Gail Thomson. Do the teenagers know anyone from Dulwich College? Nicola says she once knew a boy who went there. 'He told me how they used to stick up a finger when they saw Kingsdale kids just to provoke us,' and she demonstrates. \u00efIt was their laugh of the day,' she says, bitterly. But mostly they don\u00cdt draw comparison with their neighbours: 'The only difference I can see between what they have and we have is the money - they have the money.' Guyson says: 'There is no difference. We have the same standards, the same talent to follow it through.' The pupils are all going on to sixth-form college. Some will do A-levels - computer studies, graphic design, media studies are mentioned. Some will do vocational exams. Tunde is going to college to do a BTEC in media studies - if he gets five GCSEs above grade C. Then, he says, he will go to university. He has a talent for graphics. The teenagers at Kingsdale have another reason to look forward. The school is about to undergo a \u00a37.5 million redesign. It is an experimental project, which could be a model for other schools. Architects and anthropologists have drawn up plans which will end what they describe as the culture of 'custodial containment' making it a 'hub of learning' in the community. Classrooms will be rearranged to promote rather than hinder learning. 'Does maths have to be taught in a classroom at all?' asks one of the planners, who have thought of everything from bright toilet paper to a new house system, ensuring better pastoral care. There are those in the LEA who believe a revamped Kingsdale might one day compete with Dulwich College for pupils. The children themselves ask less from the new make-over. Just new chairs would be good, says Guyson 'so my knees don't bang into the desk'. They would like somewhere to meet and relax and more room to eat. 'Lockers,' says Tunde. But not everyone is as optimistic for Kingsdale\u00cds future as the school planners. Even as the redesign gets under way, Southwark LEA has found a new way of depriving Kingsdale of a more balanced intake. Close by, a different kind of 'model school', known as the Charter School, has been opened. The Charter School was once known as Dulwich High School (which was once known as William Penn). Not only has Dulwich High been redesigned and given a new name, it has also been given a brand new set of hand-picked children, and is already hoovering up the privileged middle-class kids who might go to state schools. At Dulwich College, Able looks bemused by the suggestion that he may face competition from the state sector: he is looking forward next year to his biggest ever intake into the school. 'It is simply not possible to provide the education we offer with the money the state currently provides in the maintained sector.' It is the end of the school day and the coaches are lining up again to take college pupils home. Kingsdale pupils have already left. There have been occasional glimmers of real interest in each other's worlds. 'What did they say about us?' asks Morrison. And occasional glimmers of understanding. 'Talent can always be brought out,' says Able.",

      "byline": "Monty Don",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> It is a funny time to be writing about roses, when the snow is filling the window with jerking, berserk flakes. The garden below is lost in a swirl. Ten minutes ago the sun was shining. In half an hour it will probably be doing so again. March, you see. And not a rose to be seen. Nor will there be until May, when Rosa cantabridgiensis will undoubtedly be the first to bloom in this garden, its little snouts of primrose flowers breaking along the length of its branches against the fern-like leaves. This makes me extraordinarily happy when it happens. A rich day. </p> <p>But now, despite the weather, it is time to be taking stock of the roses in your garden and for making last-minute plans to plant some more. It is best to get them in the ground as soon as possible, certainly if they are bare-root (and so much better and cheaper if you can). Even if they're in a container and therefore - in theory - plantable at any time of year, day or night, it is best to give the growing roots as long as possible to get used to your soil before they flower. Containerised plants planted after about May have an incredible tenacity when it comes to restricting themselves to the potting compost of their container, and take until the following season to grow out of it. </p> <p>There was a rose blooming furiously at the Chelsea Physic Garden when I was there in January, which apparently flowers every single day of the year. But the Physic Garden is exceptionally sheltered and mild and I don't think that it would withstand the temperature lows of this garden. Anyway, I feel no urge at all to stretch the boundaries of the possible in this garden. I don't really want roses in January any more than I want asparagus in October. I like seasonal variation, and May, June and July are measured as much by roses as the sunshine or leathery smell of a cricket ball. </p> <p>I came to roses late, not really knowing anything about them other than their obvious and conventional status as an icon of beauty. I then assumed the rigour and rigid parameters of the newly converted, affecting to love only 'old' roses and publicly despising all hybrid teas, floribundas and china roses. This is as silly as limiting yourself to only liking rap music or pre-1750 cantatas. But, of course, the whole point about a little knowledge is that it can be terrifying. Affecting to like only that which you know is a way of covering up how limited your knowledge is. It is true of me, at any rate. This shows a lack of trust in one's judgement, too; if a flower is lovely, who cares if it belongs to a gallica, centifolia, floribunda or rambler? </p> <p>But as I learn a little more about roses, I do tend to get more pleasure from shrub roses than hybrid teas and more from the older shrubs, such as the rugosas, bourbons, damasks or albas, than modern ones. I particularly like the combination of delicacy and opulence, the way that none are designed to be labour-saving, fast, long lasting, thornless, small or whatever attribute is thought to be desirable for the modern gardener. They are themselves - almost. I am being selectively disingenuous. Roses have been bred for many centuries and by the end of the 18th century new hybrids were being produced by the hundred. But they were, as far as I know, bred entirely for their aesthetic qualities rather than their user-friendliness. </p> <p>If you want the real, untrammelled thing, then you must turn to the species roses. These are the pure, essential thing. The first thing one notices if you see a selection of species roses in flower is that they are pretty unshowy. No petal-crammed blooms but single flowers which in turn develop a range of extraordinarily beautiful hips. The thorns vary enormously, from the bristle of R pimpinellifolia to the famous shark's fin thorns of R sericea pteracantha , or the spiralled interlocking helix of R willmottiae . </p> <p>In hybrid teas we endure a hideously ugly shrub for (sometimes) glorious flowers. Fair deal. With centifolias or some gallicas, we endure balled flowers, blackspot and grey mould for the few weeks when the shrub is weighed down by its fragrant, subtly voluptuous blooms. But with species roses you take the plant in its entirety and the flowers are merely the more conventionally all-singing, all-dancing aspect of its performance. The sum of any individual species rose's parts tends to amount to more than the whole. That is their great charm. </p> <p>One of the less likely parts are their coloured stems. Of the species roses I grow, R moschata and R ' Complicata' are both green-stemmed, even in the heart of winter, but R californica plena is orange, R wintoniensis red and R ferri persetosa 'Nan of Painswick' a deep alizarin. (This latter, by the way, is a seemingly 'wild' sport of the much more common Threepenny bit rose, R elegantula 'persetosa'). R primula has chocolatey, spiky stems. Oh, and it has ferny, incense-scented leaves. And beautiful, soft buttery flowers. </p> <p>I have no problem with single flowers and feel no need to apologise for the small size of the flowers on R hugonis or the delicate simplicity of R ferreri . And if R moyesii had any more petals it would explode, so intense is its red. Talking of numbers of petals, R sericea is the only rose with only four petals on each flower. The least that any other rose can reduce to is five. It is extraordinary that these modest flowers can develop in so many of the species roses into such showy, swollen hips. R rugosa 's are like tomatoes, and R moyesii' s like miniature orange bottle gourds, while those of R glauca are bunched like grapes. R wintoniensis has great clusters of flagon-shaped hips with a curious purplish bloom. </p> <p>Species climbers tend to have great vigour and masses of small flowers that appear just the once. In the 80s and early 90s, vast quantities of R filipes 'Kiftsgate' were sold to cover a couple of square yards of trellis or wall - one woman bought six from a friend of mine for her roof garden. 'Kiftsgate' will grow to a height of at least 50ft and as much again across. I grew one up a lawson cypress once, in the hope that it would smother and kill the tree. </p> <p> R filipes is less powerful but dramatic enough for most gardens. R multiflora has bunches of flowers and will grow as a shrub or clamber over a support up to 20ft high. R moschata has grey-green foliage and stems and climbs modestly, good for a tripod or shady wall and it flowers from July right into September. R longicuspis, on the other hand, has almost evergreen, leathery leaves and real climbing vigour, with what the great Peter Beales, in his indispensable book Classic Roses (\u00a340, Harvill), calls 'huge, cascading panicles of bunched, medium-sized, single, white flowers'. All these climbers have white flowers, but if you have a very sheltered south-facing wall then R banksiae 'Lutea' would cover it with yellow double flowers in May - it is one of the first of all roses to flower. R banksiae ' Lutescens' has single flowers, but they are bigger, better scented and have wonderful exaggerated stamens. </p> <p>By now, you are either sold on the idea of species roses or have dismissed them utterly. But if you are going to plant any - and there is still time to order them from a specialist nursery and get them in the ground before they start to grow too aggressively - consider their context. These are plants that like to sprawl, and you need to indulge their laxity. The conventional place to put them is a 'wild' garden, with lots of longish grass and other vigorous, large plants around them - but that suggests more space than most people have at their disposal. I have planted all mine in borders of various kinds, but they are positioned at the back so they can grow tall and floppy. They make good hosts for clematis, although pruning the late-flowering ones can be a bit tricky as they twine through some of the more aggressively thorned roses. </p> <p>Species roses are among the toughest plants in the garden and will grow in almost any soil and any position, but place them where you can get close enough to appreciate their detail throughout the seasons and yet with enough space for them to sprawl in the untrainable, unbred manner that is such important part of their immense charm.</p> <p><strong>My roots: a week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>The ground has frozen hard every night for the past week. This is great. For a start it means when I go outside first thing I can keep my shoes on. Wonderful! For those of you who are used to being carelessly dry shod - wearing shoes as though they were part of your dress, deliciously soft leather, co-ordinated perhaps, chosen for they way that they make you look... crazee - that is not the way it is in these parts. </p> <p>The magic of frost is that I tread above the ground, ride the surface like a conveyor belt. I stick the kettle on the Aga, go out the back door (dogs stamping impatiently as I fiddle with the bolt) and straight to the greenhouse to check if the electric thermostatic heaters worked. (Mind you, when it was really cold I couldn't even do that because the aluminium door froze.) Then I check the thermometer. After that it's onwards to the chickens via the Jewel garden, relishing the hard bobbles and ruts of the mud, softly crushing the frozen grass and stamping contemptuously on the quagmire in the chickens' pen. In my slippers! Gardening doesn't hold many more triumphs than this. </p> <p>The mud is entirely responsible for the indignity of having to wear slippers in the first place. Because I go in and out like a yo-yo, the only sense is to wear shoes indoors that slip on and off. </p> <p>A hundred 3'6\" sharpened split chestnut stakes were delivered the other day. Stacked in the yard, sharp ends at right angles in alternating layers, they are ravishingly beautiful - as aesthetically inspiring to my eyes as any piece of carefully constructed installation art. They are the uprights to take woven hazel rods for the low fences around my vegetable beds. These fences only last about three years because the wet soil rots the hazel, which, if dry, will last three times as long. </p> <p>The posts are of chestnut, partly because it splits beautifully so you can have very strong quarter-split posts, but mainly because chestnut is very slow to rot in the ground. So each post lasts about three batches of hazel renewal. But now the time has come to change it all over. This is hard work. The secret is to have them rock firm and perfectly upright in a dead straight line - then the interweaving is easy. I adore doing this and love the results. The only bad thing about them is that the snails love them, too, sheltering within the weave during the day before slipping out to dine on my vegetables throughout the night.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a funny time to be writing about roses, when the snow is filling the window with jerking, berserk flakes. The garden below is lost in a swirl. Ten minutes ago the sun was shining. In half an hour it will probably be doing so again. March, you see. And not a rose to be seen. Nor will there be until May, when Rosa cantabridgiensis will undoubtedly be the first to bloom in this garden, its little snouts of primrose flowers breaking along the length of its branches against the fern-like leaves. This makes me extraordinarily happy when it happens. A rich day. But now, despite the weather, it is time to be taking stock of the roses in your garden and for making last-minute plans to plant some more. It is best to get them in the ground as soon as possible, certainly if they are bare-root (and so much better and cheaper if you can). Even if they're in a container and therefore - in theory - plantable at any time of year, day or night, it is best to give the growing roots as long as possible to get used to your soil before they flower. Containerised plants planted after about May have an incredible tenacity when it comes to restricting themselves to the potting compost of their container, and take until the following season to grow out of it. There was a rose blooming furiously at the Chelsea Physic Garden when I was there in January, which apparently flowers every single day of the year. But the Physic Garden is exceptionally sheltered and mild and I don't think that it would withstand the temperature lows of this garden. Anyway, I feel no urge at all to stretch the boundaries of the possible in this garden. I don't really want roses in January any more than I want asparagus in October. I like seasonal variation, and May, June and July are measured as much by roses as the sunshine or leathery smell of a cricket ball. I came to roses late, not really knowing anything about them other than their obvious and conventional status as an icon of beauty. I then assumed the rigour and rigid parameters of the newly converted, affecting to love only 'old' roses and publicly despising all hybrid teas, floribundas and china roses. This is as silly as limiting yourself to only liking rap music or pre-1750 cantatas. But, of course, the whole point about a little knowledge is that it can be terrifying. Affecting to like only that which you know is a way of covering up how limited your knowledge is. It is true of me, at any rate. This shows a lack of trust in one's judgement, too; if a flower is lovely, who cares if it belongs to a gallica, centifolia, floribunda or rambler? But as I learn a little more about roses, I do tend to get more pleasure from shrub roses than hybrid teas and more from the older shrubs, such as the rugosas, bourbons, damasks or albas, than modern ones. I particularly like the combination of delicacy and opulence, the way that none are designed to be labour-saving, fast, long lasting, thornless, small or whatever attribute is thought to be desirable for the modern gardener. They are themselves - almost. I am being selectively disingenuous. Roses have been bred for many centuries and by the end of the 18th century new hybrids were being produced by the hundred. But they were, as far as I know, bred entirely for their aesthetic qualities rather than their user-friendliness. If you want the real, untrammelled thing, then you must turn to the species roses. These are the pure, essential thing. The first thing one notices if you see a selection of species roses in flower is that they are pretty unshowy. No petal-crammed blooms but single flowers which in turn develop a range of extraordinarily beautiful hips. The thorns vary enormously, from the bristle of R pimpinellifolia to the famous shark's fin thorns of R sericea pteracantha , or the spiralled interlocking helix of R willmottiae . In hybrid teas we endure a hideously ugly shrub for (sometimes) glorious flowers. Fair deal. With centifolias or some gallicas, we endure balled flowers, blackspot and grey mould for the few weeks when the shrub is weighed down by its fragrant, subtly voluptuous blooms. But with species roses you take the plant in its entirety and the flowers are merely the more conventionally all-singing, all-dancing aspect of its performance. The sum of any individual species rose's parts tends to amount to more than the whole. That is their great charm. One of the less likely parts are their coloured stems. Of the species roses I grow, R moschata and R ' Complicata' are both green-stemmed, even in the heart of winter, but R californica plena is orange, R wintoniensis red and R ferri persetosa 'Nan of Painswick' a deep alizarin. (This latter, by the way, is a seemingly 'wild' sport of the much more common Threepenny bit rose, R elegantula 'persetosa'). R primula has chocolatey, spiky stems. Oh, and it has ferny, incense-scented leaves. And beautiful, soft buttery flowers. I have no problem with single flowers and feel no need to apologise for the small size of the flowers on R hugonis or the delicate simplicity of R ferreri . And if R moyesii had any more petals it would explode, so intense is its red. Talking of numbers of petals, R sericea is the only rose with only four petals on each flower. The least that any other rose can reduce to is five. It is extraordinary that these modest flowers can develop in so many of the species roses into such showy, swollen hips. R rugosa 's are like tomatoes, and R moyesii' s like miniature orange bottle gourds, while those of R glauca are bunched like grapes. R wintoniensis has great clusters of flagon-shaped hips with a curious purplish bloom. Species climbers tend to have great vigour and masses of small flowers that appear just the once. In the 80s and early 90s, vast quantities of R filipes 'Kiftsgate' were sold to cover a couple of square yards of trellis or wall - one woman bought six from a friend of mine for her roof garden. 'Kiftsgate' will grow to a height of at least 50ft and as much again across. I grew one up a lawson cypress once, in the hope that it would smother and kill the tree. R filipes is less powerful but dramatic enough for most gardens. R multiflora has bunches of flowers and will grow as a shrub or clamber over a support up to 20ft high. R moschata has grey-green foliage and stems and climbs modestly, good for a tripod or shady wall and it flowers from July right into September. R longicuspis, on the other hand, has almost evergreen, leathery leaves and real climbing vigour, with what the great Peter Beales, in his indispensable book Classic Roses (\u00a340, Harvill), calls 'huge, cascading panicles of bunched, medium-sized, single, white flowers'. All these climbers have white flowers, but if you have a very sheltered south-facing wall then R banksiae 'Lutea' would cover it with yellow double flowers in May - it is one of the first of all roses to flower. R banksiae ' Lutescens' has single flowers, but they are bigger, better scented and have wonderful exaggerated stamens. By now, you are either sold on the idea of species roses or have dismissed them utterly. But if you are going to plant any - and there is still time to order them from a specialist nursery and get them in the ground before they start to grow too aggressively - consider their context. These are plants that like to sprawl, and you need to indulge their laxity. The conventional place to put them is a 'wild' garden, with lots of longish grass and other vigorous, large plants around them - but that suggests more space than most people have at their disposal. I have planted all mine in borders of various kinds, but they are positioned at the back so they can grow tall and floppy. They make good hosts for clematis, although pruning the late-flowering ones can be a bit tricky as they twine through some of the more aggressively thorned roses. Species roses are among the toughest plants in the garden and will grow in almost any soil and any position, but place them where you can get close enough to appreciate their detail throughout the seasons and yet with enough space for them to sprawl in the untrainable, unbred manner that is such important part of their immense charm. My roots: a week in Monty's garden The ground has frozen hard every night for the past week. This is great. For a start it means when I go outside first thing I can keep my shoes on. Wonderful! For those of you who are used to being carelessly dry shod - wearing shoes as though they were part of your dress, deliciously soft leather, co-ordinated perhaps, chosen for they way that they make you look... crazee - that is not the way it is in these parts. The magic of frost is that I tread above the ground, ride the surface like a conveyor belt. I stick the kettle on the Aga, go out the back door (dogs stamping impatiently as I fiddle with the bolt) and straight to the greenhouse to check if the electric thermostatic heaters worked. (Mind you, when it was really cold I couldn't even do that because the aluminium door froze.) Then I check the thermometer. After that it's onwards to the chickens via the Jewel garden, relishing the hard bobbles and ruts of the mud, softly crushing the frozen grass and stamping contemptuously on the quagmire in the chickens' pen. In my slippers! Gardening doesn't hold many more triumphs than this. The mud is entirely responsible for the indignity of having to wear slippers in the first place. Because I go in and out like a yo-yo, the only sense is to wear shoes indoors that slip on and off. A hundred 3'6\" sharpened split chestnut stakes were delivered the other day. Stacked in the yard, sharp ends at right angles in alternating layers, they are ravishingly beautiful - as aesthetically inspiring to my eyes as any piece of carefully constructed installation art. They are the uprights to take woven hazel rods for the low fences around my vegetable beds. These fences only last about three years because the wet soil rots the hazel, which, if dry, will last three times as long. The posts are of chestnut, partly because it splits beautifully so you can have very strong quarter-split posts, but mainly because chestnut is very slow to rot in the ground. So each post lasts about three batches of hazel renewal. But now the time has come to change it all over. This is hard work. The secret is to have them rock firm and perfectly upright in a dead straight line - then the interweaving is easy. I adore doing this and love the results. The only bad thing about them is that the snails love them, too, sheltering within the weave during the day before slipping out to dine on my vegetables throughout the night.",

      "bodyText": "Ethinc Albanian guerillas battling Macedonian forces issued a declaration of war last night, calling on all 'able-bodied men' to join their uprising in favour of self-rule. They also ordered ethnic Albanians serving in Macedonia's armed forces to desert. The call came as the United Nations issued a chilling warning to the international community that Europe was facing the threat of a massive refugee crisis in the region, following the worst day of fighting in the former Yugoslav republic since trouble erupted five days ago. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, warned of an impending humanitarian crisis as residents of Tetovo, the city at the centre of the fighting, continued to flee the city. He said: 'We cannot afford another humanitarian tragedy in the Balkans, where millions have been uprooted by violent conflicts in the last decade'. The general call up - put out by the self-styled National Liberation Army which appeared in Macedonia two months ago - came as world leaders contemplated for the first time the horrifying prospect of a full-scale war in Macedonia that threatens to divide the country along ethnic lines. Macedonia split from Yugoslavia a decade ago and had been the only former republic to secede without violence. Now the international community fears the growing conflict could ignite a conflagration that threatens to draw in Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey and suck Nato-led peacekeepers in Kosovo into the fighting. In a worrying new development ethnic Albanian guerrillas in the neighbouring Presevo Valley of southern Serbia - who with the NLA are fighting for a 'Greater Kosovo' linking Albanian areas outside Kosovo - broke a week-long ceasefire and appeared on the verge of opening a new front in their escalating border war. Yesterday Albanian leaders in Macedonia hardened their support for the extremists behind the rebellion. 'We would welcome international mediation, but I fear we are running out of time,' said Fadil Sulejmani, rector of the once-outlawed University of Tetovo, a centre for young Albanian radicals. 'This is becoming a kind of holy war.' The latest escalation of the fighting has found Nato and the international community in disarray over how to end the violence, amid fears among European government's over America's commitment to the Balkans. US peacekeeping forces in Kosovo have been criticised for standing by as former KLA fighters crossed the border into Macedonia to launch their rebellion. Yesterday Tetovo was again scene of the heaviest fighting. Soldiers in the largely Albanian-populated city used heavy machine guns mounted on armoured personnel carriers to unleash torrents of fire into the surrounding mountains, while snipers tried to pick off insurgents in the forest above. Smoke plumed from burning trees and blasts boomed through empty streets as people fled the city or hid. At the Albanian rebels' headquarters in Selce, a mile from Tetovo, new recruits continued to pour in. In an effort to contain the violence Greece announced yesterday that it would host talks with the foreign ministers of Albania and Macedonia to negotiate a ceasefire. Nato Secretary-General Lord Robertson, on a visit to Athens, said Nato forces were responding to Macedonian calls for Nato-led peacekeepers in Kosovo to shut off the flow of arms and weapons into Macedonia and Serbia. The growing crisis in the Balkans will top the agenda at the EU heads of state meeting in Stockholm this week. Ethnic Albanians account for at least a quarter of Macedonia's 2 million people, dominating western regions of the country.",

      "body": "<p>It will do for rugby what Jilly Cooper's Riders did for showjumping. A steamy new book is set to reveal the sexual exploits and off-field antics of Britain's top rugby players. The sport is bracing itself for disclosures that show events get as mucky off the pitch as on it. </p> <p>Rugby Studs is an expos\u00e9 of the groupies, heavy drinking, orgies and infidelity on overseas tours for which the game is infamous. Although fiction, it is said to be based on real-life scandal involving top stars. Wives and girlfriends are unlikely to be amused. </p> <p>The game's rulers are worried because the author, Alison Kervin, is a well-connected insider who knows many of its secrets. The respected rugby editor of the Times, Kervin is friendly with many leading players and a veteran of overseas tours. She is also a former employee of England's Rugby Football Union, and has seen women throw themselves at players. </p> <p>'Rugby players are fit young men who are attractive to women and have a huge female following,' says Kervin. 'When I worked for the RFU, the letters that arrived for them were unbelievable. Women would send their underwear to a particular player or write them letters saying things like, \"My husband's out between two and seven, why don't you come and see me?\". One even sent her door-key.' </p> <p>She describes how, at post-match dinners and balls, rugby groupies would rush up to players. 'They'd say things like, \"I've fancied you for ages,\" or, \"I think you're wonderful,\" even if the player's wife or girlfriend was there.' </p> <p>Thirty-three-year-old Kervin says Rugby Studs reflects the fact that some players do occasionally succumb to such temptations. </p> <p>Much of her bonkbuster is set in South Africa during the British Lions tour in 1997, which she attended. It charts the efforts of Isabel Jenkins, a glamorous reporter with a muck-raking Sunday tabloid, to reveal how the team's best-known player is cheating on his girlfriend with a leading South African actress. </p> <p>'He is the team's main sex symbol and a golden boy - a handsome, athletic, young David Beckham lookalike - and she has been seen leaving the team's hotel. They are having an affair and her newspaper has got wind of it,' says Kervin. </p> <p>She accepts many readers will assume the scenario was inspired by the widely rumoured affair between England captain Will Carling and the Princess of Wales, but recommends that no one should jump to such conclusions. Carling insisted he and the Princess were simply close friends - and he was not picked for the 1997 Lions tour. </p> <p>The tour led to rugby's biggest off-field scandal. In May 1999, Lawrence Dallaglio told the News of the World how he and two Lions team-mates had taken ecstasy at a post-match party at a Johannesburg hotel, and described how he and other players had hired prostitutes in Amsterdam. Dallaglio later retracted the remarks, and the RFU cleared him of wrongdoing. </p> <p>Drugs form part of the backdrop in Rugby Studs. But sex, including orgies, is the main vice on show. One Lions player gladly accepts some of the offers of intimate female company, but at least he is single. 'Rugby has a huge reputation for sex, and people think that players all go off and misbehave all the time,' says Kervin. 'That's not actually the case, as they're also training a lot.' </p> <p>The author says that, while players are meant to have become less hedonistic since the game turned professional in 1995, their opportunities for illicit liaisons have increased.

      "bodyText": "It will do for rugby what Jilly Cooper's Riders did for showjumping. A steamy new book is set to reveal the sexual exploits and off-field antics of Britain's top rugby players. The sport is bracing itself for disclosures that show events get as mucky off the pitch as on it. Rugby Studs is an expos\u00e9 of the groupies, heavy drinking, orgies and infidelity on overseas tours for which the game is infamous. Although fiction, it is said to be based on real-life scandal involving top stars. Wives and girlfriends are unlikely to be amused. The game's rulers are worried because the author, Alison Kervin, is a well-connected insider who knows many of its secrets. The respected rugby editor of the Times, Kervin is friendly with many leading players and a veteran of overseas tours. She is also a former employee of England's Rugby Football Union, and has seen women throw themselves at players. 'Rugby players are fit young men who are attractive to women and have a huge female following,' says Kervin. 'When I worked for the RFU, the letters that arrived for them were unbelievable. Women would send their underwear to a particular player or write them letters saying things like, \"My husband's out between two and seven, why don't you come and see me?\". One even sent her door-key.' She describes how, at post-match dinners and balls, rugby groupies would rush up to players. 'They'd say things like, \"I've fancied you for ages,\" or, \"I think you're wonderful,\" even if the player's wife or girlfriend was there.' Thirty-three-year-old Kervin says Rugby Studs reflects the fact that some players do occasionally succumb to such temptations. Much of her bonkbuster is set in South Africa during the British Lions tour in 1997, which she attended. It charts the efforts of Isabel Jenkins, a glamorous reporter with a muck-raking Sunday tabloid, to reveal how the team's best-known player is cheating on his girlfriend with a leading South African actress. 'He is the team's main sex symbol and a golden boy - a handsome, athletic, young David Beckham lookalike - and she has been seen leaving the team's hotel. They are having an affair and her newspaper has got wind of it,' says Kervin. She accepts many readers will assume the scenario was inspired by the widely rumoured affair between England captain Will Carling and the Princess of Wales, but recommends that no one should jump to such conclusions. Carling insisted he and the Princess were simply close friends - and he was not picked for the 1997 Lions tour. The tour led to rugby's biggest off-field scandal. In May 1999, Lawrence Dallaglio told the News of the World how he and two Lions team-mates had taken ecstasy at a post-match party at a Johannesburg hotel, and described how he and other players had hired prostitutes in Amsterdam. Dallaglio later retracted the remarks, and the RFU cleared him of wrongdoing. Drugs form part of the backdrop in Rugby Studs. But sex, including orgies, is the main vice on show. One Lions player gladly accepts some of the offers of intimate female company, but at least he is single. 'Rugby has a huge reputation for sex, and people think that players all go off and misbehave all the time,' says Kervin. 'That's not actually the case, as they're also training a lot.' The author says that, while players are meant to have become less hedonistic since the game turned professional in 1995, their opportunities for illicit liaisons have increased. 'Rugby women traditionally wore Barbour jackets, rugby shirts and sensible trousers. But a new breed of female fan has emerged who sees it as glamorous, sexy and alluring, and hangs around waiting to meet the players, especially the famous ones,' says Kervin. 'If you go to any club on a Saturday afternoon, like Harlequins, you can see these women. They wear skimpy clothes and are dressed up as if they're going out on a Friday night.' Kervin has more sympathy for the wives and girlfriends left behind while their men go on tour. 'Their insecurities are one example of the damage fame can do, which is one of the book's more serious themes.' She will be in Australia for the Times for the forthcoming Lions tour, but will also be keeping her eyes open for material she can work into Rugby Studs, which will be published in the summer. Mike Burton, a veteran of England overseas tours in the Seventies, says: 'Club teams touring places like Jersey and Guernsey are much more boisterous than serious tours by England or the Lions. Alison has a very vivid imagination, and that may reflect the way she spent her girlhood! Regrettably, I missed out on most of the stuff she's written about.' denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<b> Sunday: suited and booted</b> <p>Here I am, standing in a white suit, with silver hair, and a poodle at my side. I wouldn't normally do this sort of thing. Not in the real world, anyway. But in cyberspace, you can be or do whatever you want - can't you?</p> <p>That's the theory, at least. I'm in a room entitled Cosmic Vibe, part of a site called Cycosmos. For those interested in getting to know me further, I have an identity card listing my interests in film, literature, sport and music. What's more, in Cycosmos you also get an avatar - an online disguise, your 'digital being' - a choice of clothes and a choice of prop. Hence the poodle. And the white suit? Perhaps I was thinking of Tom Wolfe who, it's said, wore white to reflect the lives and opinions of others, while giving away nothing of himself. </p> <p>Watching my avatar emerge in the room, like Spock being beamed up, I realise what might be the real magic of cyber life. Whatever your age, wherever you live, whatever you look like, you can get access to the hearts, the minds, the CD collections of a rising generation, with whom you would never share air space in the real world.</p> <p>And yet something gives me away. Before I can even introduce myself the clothes clearly set me apart. There are characters with dayglo dreadlocks and shades. There's a Slim Shady (the real one?) and a Foxy Chick. Slim moves towards an avatar close to me called Shagmehard. I imagine he is a kid in some suburban bedroom, who threatens his parents with Marilyn Manson and masturbation. I can almost feel his anger as he takes in the white suit, the silver hair, the poodle. Words appear in his speech bubble: 'e luks lik e taks it up the ars.' Charming. And all before I'd even revealed my chosen name for the night. </p> <p><b> Monday: love is in the air</b></p> <p>When you become virtual, you begin with the name. It's your brand. It's how you're known throughout your travels in cyber-reality. And, initially at least, it's how you attract others. You should avoid obvious names, and also those who choose obvious names. If you're bereft of any imagination when it comes to naming yourself, chances are you're equally inept at virtual conversation. Do I really want to speak to people called Hotchick and Hardman2 at Uboot? I don't think so. Instead I venture to CosmicCupid, I become Lester Burnham, one for fans of American Beauty. Burnham is the Kevin Spacey character, the one undergoing some serious mid-life crisis. Perhaps the character is a clue to my real age or predicament. However, the eyes of Manga are upon me as a female figure straight out of Japanese comic culture is the guide through a community that has a true sense of purpose: flirtation.</p> <p>Here the goal is to target the names of others with a view to intimacy in the real world, where CosmicCupid scouts gather at real venues, spreading the message of the virtual world. A message reaches Lester. 'Didn't I see you dancing in a tight singlet at the Hanover Grand?' Lester doesn't have the heart to reply that he lives at the seaside, is going to seed, and has just turned 40. </p> <p><b>Tuesday: thank you for the music </b></p> <p>Napster is not only the place where (until music-industry injunctions took force) you have gone to download songs, it also provides community groups, though napster.com, being musically orientated, has 'channels' instead of rooms. Downloading an MP3 of Black Box Recorder's rendition of 'Uptown Top Ranking' takes me to the playlist of somebody called Voodoochile. It's an impressive list (or at least, I think so), just the sort of marginal pop I like - Magnetic Fields, Lemon Jelly, the High Chaparral theme! - and says more about the other person than e-chat ever could. I feel like I'm clinging to a flower and dragging out the pollen. Voodoochile sends me several emails, informing me that if I don't respond she will cut me off at the source. It's too late to talk. Computer crashes. </p> <p><b> Wednesday: Come and have a go</b></p> <p>To another room at Cycosmos. The virtual community, when populated by avatars, is like the early days of the computer game. Put one or more virtual characters in a room and virtual violence will ensue, unless a female character enters the room, and introduces the characters to the real prospect of virtual sex. In the Flirting Room, the busiest place in Cycosmos, you get a real sense of what passes for currency, in the absence of real conversation. The words in the bubbles, which emerge like a genie and follow the characters - these move sideways, slowly, like a crab - are mis-spelt, and the letters, in keeping with the fact that for many texting is now a first language, are kept to a minimum.</p> <p>These characters - Coolguy and a cast of six are in the house - could be speaking early Prince lyrics, but what is actually taking shape is a kind of Esperanto. A number of those present, inhabiting this other world, are, of course, from other countries. Cycosmos is a German concept that became massive on its own turf, before launching itself in other tongues.</p> <p>The chat room starts to resemble any theme pub in anytown when two teens go to war. Zee and Wardog have become embroiled in an altercation in the centre of the room. They've not come to blows but the words in their bubbles have moved into double figures. 'U r a wanker,' types Zee. Wardog takes minutes to retaliate with: 'Cum 'ere and say that.' The former takes an age to crawl in the direction of his foe, and the most extraordinary thing happens. All the other avatars, we all back away to a corner of the screen, and congregate. Absolutely no reason to do so. We are, after all, just marks on a screen, but, immersed in the site, it's amazing how 'real-world' instincts take over. Two log out. When the going gets tough, the timid get going.</p> <p><b> Thursday: time for a sex change</b></p> <p>I cut out the cryptic clues, keep it simple, and become female in an effort to hook up with a fellow traveller. I become Saffron (black bodice, thigh boots, and a bottle of champagne, as the prop of choice). It's odd.</p> <p>Cycosmos describes itself as the first cyber society, and claims that the more people return the closer they tailor their avatar to resemble their real selves. I've done the opposite. A male avatar appears. He has a shrimp-coloured suit; his prop is a sofa.</p> <p>I put words in my bubble. 'Hi, my name is Saffron. I'm desperate to fit in.' Three times I say it, and get no response. Each time the avatar moves closer to me. When I move, he moves, eventually trying to place himself on top of Saffron. Cybersex! I leave the room as fast as my pixels can carry me, change my prop to a gun and return. He's gone.</p> <p><b> Friday: this town ain't big enough</b></p> <p>To Cybertown, avoiding the Cyberhood Colony, 'where the morphs and the rebels hang out'. I choose the Entertainment Colony, and the literature neighbourhood. Entry is strict. You choose a name, return to your real life, and await an e-mail informing you of your immigration number. This gets you into Cybertown, where you have 'cash' in your bank account. You 'buy' a 3D house and furnish it, and 'shop' at the Cybertown Plaza. There's simply no need to visit the 3D chatrooms. There's so much to do. I 'live' in the Dr Seuss block. It's next to the JK Rowling block. My house looks like a deflated marshmallow. It is next to a stream. This magnificent metropolis is as great as the futurescapes that emerged from the mind of Fritz Lang, or on the set of Bladerunner.</p> <p>I furnish the house. I ignore the choice of space-age silver decor on offer, and plump for a room as plain and white as a hospital, with a coal fire. Just as, at Cycosmos, your avatar ultimately begins to resemble your real self rather than your fantasy, in Cybertown your home becomes more like your real home than your ideal home. Log off. Home by 10.</p> <p><b> Saturday: propping up the bar</b></p> <p>Be it the nightlife or the netlife it comes down to standing in a corner with a drink, swinging your arms back and forth, like someone the police would move on in a built-up area. At MobilesDisco they call it dancing. You can do a virtual dance and hold a virtual drink. And for the soundtrack you can choose music, or the sound of silence.</p> <p>I am simply Spaceman here, and like all the other figures, my character looks like a hybrid of a Lego person and Bob the Builder. The site is beautifully designed. The disco has flashing lights that switch from amber to eau de nil, and the bar upstairs, in another room, is like a modern youth club. People converse in groups at tables, with the odd word appearing in their bubble, as though they were in a real club, talking above the music. Spaceman sits alone in the corner. No one joins him. For 40 minutes no one joins him. And then, and this really is the magic of the cyber life, and being both anonymous and virtual, I walk to the centre of the room and 'shout' (i.e. in bold capitals) from my speech bubble: 'You say it best when you say nothing it all.' Suddenly a crowd begins to gather. They recognise the lyric. I begin to take requests. Houston, we have contact.</p> <p>If you would like to visit the sites mentioned, they are:</p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.cycosmos.com >www.cycosmos.com</A> <P><BR><A HREF=\" http: www.uboot.com>www.uboot.com</a></p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.cosmiccupid.com >www.cosmiccupid.com</A><P><BR><A HREF=\" http: www.napster.com>www.napster.com</a></p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.cybertown.com >www.cybertown.com</A><P><BR><A HREF=\" http: www.mobilesdisco.com>www.mobilesdisco.com</a></p>",

Home by 10. Saturday: propping up the bar Be it the nightlife or the netlife it comes down to standing in a corner with a drink, swinging your arms back and forth, like someone the police would move on in a built-up area. At MobilesDisco they call it dancing. You can do a virtual dance and hold a virtual drink. And for the soundtrack you can choose music, or the sound of silence. I am simply Spaceman here, and like all the other figures, my character looks like a hybrid of a Lego person and Bob the Builder. The site is beautifully designed. The disco has flashing lights that switch from amber to eau de nil, and the bar upstairs, in another room, is like a modern youth club. People converse in groups at tables, with the odd word appearing in their bubble, as though they were in a real club, talking above the music. Spaceman sits alone in the corner. No one joins him. For 40 minutes no one joins him. And then, and this really is the magic of the cyber life, and being both anonymous and virtual, I walk to the centre of the room and 'shout' (i.e. in bold capitals) from my speech bubble: 'You say it best when you say nothing it all.' Suddenly a crowd begins to gather. They recognise the lyric. I begin to take requests. Houston, we have contact. If you would like to visit the sites mentioned, they are: www.uboot.com www.napster.com www.mobilesdisco.com",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you read this paper a year ago you would have been looking at what online publishers liked to call a 'legacy publication' - one printed on paper. The term summed up what they thought of newsprint: outmoded, outdated and soon to be sent the way of the telegram. </p> <p>In those good old days, before the dotcom dream collapsed, online publishers could afford to be confident that the nimbleness of the internet would give them an edge over old media. When Slate and Salon were launched five years ago, it was amid claims that 'webzines' would become multimillion-dollar businesses and ruin print publications by stealing their readership and advertising. They were flush with venture capital, internet advertising was increasing, and readership was on the rise. </p> <p>Even last year, when the important-sounding Powerful Media launched media website Inside.com just as the tech-stock bubble burst, confidence was still on their side. Not only would Inside.com have 30,000 subscribers forking out over $200 for the service within a year, but within three years that number would climb to 100,000 and it would be in profit. But like most businesses with a dotcom suffix, the reality turned grim. In the past year, subscriptions have dried up and advertising has deserted the internet. A dozen web-only publications have folded; others have had to retrench and revise their plans. </p> <p>'Things look really bleak right now' for online content companies, says an analyst at Jupiter Communications. Many have given up trying to charge subscriptions and are instead building relationships with healthier partners. And with an irony not lost on 'legacy publications', many webzines have turned to what they once scorned - print. </p> <p>'We realised pretty early on that being an independent, web-only provider was not entirely viable,' says Michael Hirschorn, editor and co-founder of Inside.com, which recently launched a print edition. Salon.com has cut staff and branched out into newsletters. Rival Slate, though somewhat protected by its owner, Microsoft, has also launched an edition that can be downloaded and printed out. They all have one aim: to build readership and hang on long enough for someone to work out how to make money publishing on the internet. That does not look likely to happen soon. Inside.com is understood to be looking for a buyer before it suffers a cash crunch; it is even holding talks with arch-rival Variety. </p> <p>But analysts say the retrenchment does not signify a retreat from the internet as a means of communication. According to Jupiter Media Matrix, a New York research firm that tracks online readership, the number of people who go online for news and analysis is growing faster than that for any other medium. A similar pattern was observed during the infancies of cable, television and radio. This supports the argument that to judge the internet solely by stock valuation and profit is to miss the point. Slate publisher Scott Moore argues that the audience that matters is not Wall Street analysts and media critics but the readers. After all, Slate on the web attracts 2 million visitors a month. </p> <p>'From my perspective, a lot of the negative stuff that has been written about internet content is from the perspective of Wall Street,' he told the New York Times . 'If you look at it from a users' perspective, online content is not only alive and well but thriving.' Some webzines, including those that found readers were unwilling to pay subscriptions, such as TheStreet.com, hope to start charging for their stories at some point. Others are likely to increase the space given to advertising. Currently online publishers devote only about 20 per cent of screen space to ads; the proportion for newspapers is 60 per cent. </p> <p>Web content businesses are not alone in feeling a cold draught. Established print media companies have also cut back staff and investment in their online editions. Last week Pearson slashed $75m from the budget for FT.com. It was a significant move. Pearson poured $294m into its web operation last year, with the aim of making FT.com the world's 'leading global business portal'. </p> <p>In recent months, companies from CNN to Cond\u00e9 Nast have scaled back their web ambitions, and the retrenchment mirrors a downturn in newspaper business. Last week, two of America's most powerful newspaper companies warned that they had been hit by the economic downturn. Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said it would earn about a third as much as analysts had expected in the first quarter and would shed staff. The New York Times issued a similar earnings warning, and the San Jose Mercury News, in once-booming Silicon Valley, has also said it will lay off some employees. </p> <p>Few online content businesses are immune. Last summer, book publishing giant Random House announced the debut of an e-book imprint, AtRandom.com. The company proclaimed that tech-savvy readers could use their computers to download the prose of writers such as Elizabeth Wurtzel, New Yorker staff writer Tad Friend and dotcom chronicler Po Bronson. New titles by these authors would be available only as e-books. But Wurtzel's Radical Sanity was downloaded just 40 times in the first two weeks of release. At $10 each, she has now sold 100 copies. Random House recently reversed its pledge and announced that it would, after all, offer print versions of its e-books. </p> <p>'Words printed on a page provide a reading experience that is one we're accustomed to, but also, as it turns out, one that is extremely efficient,' says AtRandom.com editorial director Mary Bahr. 'A paperback is not enormously expensive for us to produce, or for the reader to buy.' Her sentiments are similar to those heard across business as the commercial realities of electronic information delivery become clear. </p> <p>In the absence of revenue, a system launched last month by Amazon allows internet users to give money to their favourite, struggling webzines. The company launched the Amazon Honor System to take advantage of its 30 million credit card database and allow customers to donate. Surfers at participating sites can click on an image and be whisked to Amazon.com, where they can decide how much money to give, with donations beginning at one dollar. Amazon's servers recognise the person as a customer, charge the amount to the customer's card and pass the money to the website, minus 15 cents per donation, no matter what the size, and 15 per cent of the total as commission. </p> <p>For some, the service has already proved a boon. Journalist Andrew Sullivan, former editor of the New Republic, raised more than $5,000 in the first 10 days his site andrewsullivan.com was hooked up to the system. </p> <p>But others have yet to reap a windfall. In the first five weeks of operation, Modern Humorist has raised $565.99, SatireWire has pulled in $657 from 153 donors and E [as in Environmental] magazine just $11. </p> <p>The programme launched with 50 sites, and Alan Kaplan, Amazon's vice-president of payment services, says that 'thousands' have signed on since. Chank Diesel, editor of Chank.com, says about $50 a week is flowing into his company through the honour system. 'We're not getting rich, but we're getting something,' he says. 'I guess you could make a living at it, but it's the honour system. You give people a choice to pay or not pay, and most aren't going to pay.'</p>",

The term summed up what they thought of newsprint: outmoded, outdated and soon to be sent the way of the telegram. In those good old days, before the dotcom dream collapsed, online publishers could afford to be confident that the nimbleness of the internet would give them an edge over old media. When Slate and Salon were launched five years ago, it was amid claims that 'webzines' would become multimillion-dollar businesses and ruin print publications by stealing their readership and advertising. They were flush with venture capital, internet advertising was increasing, and readership was on the rise. Even last year, when the important-sounding Powerful Media launched media website Inside.com just as the tech-stock bubble burst, confidence was still on their side. Not only would Inside.com have 30,000 subscribers forking out over $200 for the service within a year, but within three years that number would climb to 100,000 and it would be in profit. But like most businesses with a dotcom suffix, the reality turned grim. In the past year, subscriptions have dried up and advertising has deserted the internet. A dozen web-only publications have folded; others have had to retrench and revise their plans. 'Things look really bleak right now' for online content companies, says an analyst at Jupiter Communications. Many have given up trying to charge subscriptions and are instead building relationships with healthier partners. And with an irony not lost on 'legacy publications', many webzines have turned to what they once scorned - print. 'We realised pretty early on that being an independent, web-only provider was not entirely viable,' says Michael Hirschorn, editor and co-founder of Inside.com, which recently launched a print edition. Salon.com has cut staff and branched out into newsletters. Rival Slate, though somewhat protected by its owner, Microsoft, has also launched an edition that can be downloaded and printed out. They all have one aim: to build readership and hang on long enough for someone to work out how to make money publishing on the internet. That does not look likely to happen soon. Inside.com is understood to be looking for a buyer before it suffers a cash crunch; it is even holding talks with arch-rival Variety. But analysts say the retrenchment does not signify a retreat from the internet as a means of communication. According to Jupiter Media Matrix, a New York research firm that tracks online readership, the number of people who go online for news and analysis is growing faster than that for any other medium. A similar pattern was observed during the infancies of cable, television and radio. This supports the argument that to judge the internet solely by stock valuation and profit is to miss the point. Slate publisher Scott Moore argues that the audience that matters is not Wall Street analysts and media critics but the readers. After all, Slate on the web attracts 2 million visitors a month. 'From my perspective, a lot of the negative stuff that has been written about internet content is from the perspective of Wall Street,' he told the New York Times . 'If you look at it from a users' perspective, online content is not only alive and well but thriving.' Some webzines, including those that found readers were unwilling to pay subscriptions, such as TheStreet.com, hope to start charging for their stories at some point. Others are likely to increase the space given to advertising. Currently online publishers devote only about 20 per cent of screen space to ads; the proportion for newspapers is 60 per cent. Web content businesses are not alone in feeling a cold draught. Established print media companies have also cut back staff and investment in their online editions. Last week Pearson slashed $75m from the budget for FT.com. It was a significant move. Pearson poured $294m into its web operation last year, with the aim of making FT.com the world's 'leading global business portal'. In recent months, companies from CNN to Cond\u00e9 Nast have scaled back their web ambitions, and the retrenchment mirrors a downturn in newspaper business. Last week, two of America's most powerful newspaper companies warned that they had been hit by the economic downturn. Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said it would earn about a third as much as analysts had expected in the first quarter and would shed staff. The New York Times issued a similar earnings warning, and the San Jose Mercury News, in once-booming Silicon Valley, has also said it will lay off some employees. Few online content businesses are immune. Last summer, book publishing giant Random House announced the debut of an e-book imprint, AtRandom.com. The company proclaimed that tech-savvy readers could use their computers to download the prose of writers such as Elizabeth Wurtzel, New Yorker staff writer Tad Friend and dotcom chronicler Po Bronson. New titles by these authors would be available only as e-books. But Wurtzel's Radical Sanity was downloaded just 40 times in the first two weeks of release. At $10 each, she has now sold 100 copies. Random House recently reversed its pledge and announced that it would, after all, offer print versions of its e-books. 'Words printed on a page provide a reading experience that is one we're accustomed to, but also, as it turns out, one that is extremely efficient,' says AtRandom.com editorial director Mary Bahr. 'A paperback is not enormously expensive for us to produce, or for the reader to buy.' Her sentiments are similar to those heard across business as the commercial realities of electronic information delivery become clear. In the absence of revenue, a system launched last month by Amazon allows internet users to give money to their favourite, struggling webzines. The company launched the Amazon Honor System to take advantage of its 30 million credit card database and allow customers to donate. Surfers at participating sites can click on an image and be whisked to Amazon.com, where they can decide how much money to give, with donations beginning at one dollar. Amazon's servers recognise the person as a customer, charge the amount to the customer's card and pass the money to the website, minus 15 cents per donation, no matter what the size, and 15 per cent of the total as commission. For some, the service has already proved a boon. Journalist Andrew Sullivan, former editor of the New Republic, raised more than $5,000 in the first 10 days his site andrewsullivan.com was hooked up to the system. But others have yet to reap a windfall. In the first five weeks of operation, Modern Humorist has raised $565.99, SatireWire has pulled in $657 from 153 donors and E [as in Environmental] magazine just $11. The programme launched with 50 sites, and Alan Kaplan, Amazon's vice-president of payment services, says that 'thousands' have signed on since. Chank Diesel, editor of Chank.com, says about $50 a week is flowing into his company through the honour system. 'We're not getting rich, but we're getting something,' he says. 'I guess you could make a living at it, but it's the honour system. You give people a choice to pay or not pay, and most aren't going to pay.'",

      "body": "<p>The rules are simple: contestants don't volunteer, they are selected at random. They are assigned a TV crew and a gun. They are given a list of names. They must kill these people. Or be killed themselves. Welcome to Series 7: The Contenders. </p> <p>Happily, this latest demented instalment of reality TV exists only as the central conceit of a movie. But though it's a low-budget indie debut, film critics who caught its first showing at the Sundance Film Festival are saying it is set to be this year's Blair Witch Project. </p> <p>The makers encourage that comparison by using the gimmick of a website that pretends the whole thing is real. There you'll find the eight-month pregnant reigning Series 7 champion, who is prone to dietary cravings and mood swings while she continues her murder spree. 'Have you got any bean dip?' she demands of a terrified store clerk after yet another televised slaying. </p> <p>This is a world where teens give each other bullet-proof vests as tokens of their puppy love, and it's all packaged with the zappy graphics and sloganeering of tabloid TV: 'Real People. Real Danger. In A Fight For Their Lives!' </p> <p>The film has its origins in writer/ director Daniel Minahan's background in reality TV. After working with fellow cutting edge director Mary Harron ( I Shot Andy Warhol, American Psycho) on BBC arts programmes in the Eighties, he ended up working for Rupert Murdoch's Fox network, producing MTV-ish 'news' segments. After the rarefied atmosphere of The Late Show, it wasn't a happy experience. 'I got a real taste of corporate television,' he says. 'Part of what the film is about is what I learnt about the exploitation and representation of people in those shows.' </p> <p>Series 7 isn't the only big screen take on small screen culture coming our way. John Herzfeld's Fifteen Minutes stars Kelsey Grammer as a sleazy tabloid TV host who pursues a pair of psychotic mass murderers for a videotape of their crimes, and Robert De Niro as a media-dazzled cop. It's a film which alleges that television is complicit in promoting the violence and mayhem it pretends to condemn while simultaneously serving it up, pre-edited and packaged to a ravenous public. </p> <p>Hollywood's sniping at the small screen might appear disingenuous in a week when US courts, after much legal hand-wringing, dismissed a lawsuit against Oliver Stone and the makers of Natural Born Killers which alleged that it was the cause of a shooting in Louisiana in 1995. But, of course, it's nothing new. Hollywood's strained relationship with television goes back to the early Fifties. The birth of TV horrified movie executives who feared that audiences would rather stay home than travel to the cinema. Not only that, but television offered something movies couldn't: real people. The quiz shows and soaps that crammed those early TV schedules were filled with people and situations your average American householder could instantly recognise - a world away from the glitz that Hollywood had made its own. </p> <p>The result was that TV was at first ignored - try spotting a television set in any living room from a Fifties movie - and then rubbished. Actors weighed in, Groucho Marx famously remarking that he found television a fabulously educative medium. 'Whenever someone turns it on I go into another room and read a good book,' he informed America. (That didn't stop him hosting a quiz show, however.) </p> <p>Dirk Bogarde refused to appear on the smaller screen at all. 'I don't want my audience going for a piss or making tea while I work,' he reasoned. </p> <p>By the Seventies, satire had become Hollywood's favoured mode of attack. Writer Paddy Chayefski and director Sidney Lumet fashioned a masterpiece in Network (1976), complete with Peter Finch's immortal mantra 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!' It painted television as a medium so corrupt that it would exploit a man's nervous breakdown and screen his suicide in the name of ratings. </p> <p>And as it got harder and harder on television, Hollywood was noticeably soft on itself. With the possible exception of The Player (1992) - director Robert Altman genuinely loathes the movie business - satires about Hollywood tended to be of the ever-so-gently self-deprecating type. Sweet Liberty (1986), with Alan Alda directing and starring, The Big Picture (1989), directed by Christopher Guest and starring Kevin Bacon, and indie fare such as Tom DiCillo's Living In Oblivion (1994) all took a soft line. Hey, they said, Hollywood might be insane, corrupt and venal, but it's all just a bit of a laugh really. </p> <p>Things settled down a little in the Nineties. With the exception of The Truman Show and Natural Born Killers, movies about television tended to be gentle comedies (Soapdish, Groundhog Day) or soapish dramas (Broadcast News, Up Close And Personal). Part of the reason, no doubt, was that the major studios were now all heavily involved in producing television programmes themselves and cross-fertilising between the two media. Successful television series could be given the big screen treatment (The X Files, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Trek: The Next Generation) while failed movie projects could be transferred to the small screen and given a lucrative new lease of life (Buffy The Vampire Slayer). </p> <p>And although one of last year's Oscar Best Picture nominations, The Insider, was an intelligent expos\u00e9 of the vested interests within a US TV news network, it was the exception that proves the rule. </p> <p>All of which provokes the question: what rocked the apple cart? Why the sudden recommencement of hostilities? For a start there may be the creeping realisation that, in quality terms at least, television has been outperforming cinema for at least the past decade. Few big screen comedies have been as deftly written as Seinfeld, Frasier or The Simpsons at their best. It's difficult to find a cop movie as well acted as NYPD Blue or a crime thriller as compelling as Murder One. </p> <p>Then there's the small matter of Washington's avowed intent to clean up Hollywood. With censorious eyes from both main parties directed towards the movie business, now would be the perfect time to nod towards the small screen and its excesses. </p> <p>But most of all, movies like Series 7 and Fifteen Minutes point to the fact that with reality TV the small screen has come up with a format that movies can neither emulate nor top. While in drama and comedy the two are at least theoretically evenly matched, in this new arena Hollywood has no way of competing with its precocious younger relation. Satire is the only option. </p> <p>We should be worried. Only a few years ago the idea that audiences would tune into a show dedicated to watching the minutiae of everyday life from all angles was a ludicrous proposition aptly captured in Peter Weir's The Truman Show. Then came Big Brother, and the stuff of speculative satire became reality. </p> <p>The current vogue for reality TV is beyond satire, especially in the States. Imagine just a few years back pitching a show where long-term couples were separated and had their relationships deliberately tested (Temptation Island). Or a survival programme where the viewing highlight will be a middle-class group's clumsy attempts to slaughter a pig (Survivor). You'd have been laughed at. But it all came true. </p> <p>And with current formats running out of steam the last thing we need is some telly executive staring at a screening of Fifteen Minutes and wondering 'what if ...' </p> <p> Fifteen Minutes opens next Friday and Series 7 on 1 June.

      "bodyText": "The rules are simple: contestants don't volunteer, they are selected at random. They are assigned a TV crew and a gun. They are given a list of names. They must kill these people. Or be killed themselves. Welcome to Series 7: The Contenders. Happily, this latest demented instalment of reality TV exists only as the central conceit of a movie. But though it's a low-budget indie debut, film critics who caught its first showing at the Sundance Film Festival are saying it is set to be this year's Blair Witch Project. The makers encourage that comparison by using the gimmick of a website that pretends the whole thing is real. There you'll find the eight-month pregnant reigning Series 7 champion, who is prone to dietary cravings and mood swings while she continues her murder spree. 'Have you got any bean dip?' she demands of a terrified store clerk after yet another televised slaying. This is a world where teens give each other bullet-proof vests as tokens of their puppy love, and it's all packaged with the zappy graphics and sloganeering of tabloid TV: 'Real People. Real Danger. In A Fight For Their Lives!' The film has its origins in writer/ director Daniel Minahan's background in reality TV. After working with fellow cutting edge director Mary Harron ( I Shot Andy Warhol, American Psycho) on BBC arts programmes in the Eighties, he ended up working for Rupert Murdoch's Fox network, producing MTV-ish 'news' segments. After the rarefied atmosphere of The Late Show, it wasn't a happy experience. 'I got a real taste of corporate television,' he says. 'Part of what the film is about is what I learnt about the exploitation and representation of people in those shows.' Series 7 isn't the only big screen take on small screen culture coming our way. John Herzfeld's Fifteen Minutes stars Kelsey Grammer as a sleazy tabloid TV host who pursues a pair of psychotic mass murderers for a videotape of their crimes, and Robert De Niro as a media-dazzled cop. It's a film which alleges that television is complicit in promoting the violence and mayhem it pretends to condemn while simultaneously serving it up, pre-edited and packaged to a ravenous public. Hollywood's sniping at the small screen might appear disingenuous in a week when US courts, after much legal hand-wringing, dismissed a lawsuit against Oliver Stone and the makers of Natural Born Killers which alleged that it was the cause of a shooting in Louisiana in 1995. But, of course, it's nothing new. Hollywood's strained relationship with television goes back to the early Fifties. The birth of TV horrified movie executives who feared that audiences would rather stay home than travel to the cinema. Not only that, but television offered something movies couldn't: real people. The quiz shows and soaps that crammed those early TV schedules were filled with people and situations your average American householder could instantly recognise - a world away from the glitz that Hollywood had made its own. The result was that TV was at first ignored - try spotting a television set in any living room from a Fifties movie - and then rubbished. Actors weighed in, Groucho Marx famously remarking that he found television a fabulously educative medium. 'Whenever someone turns it on I go into another room and read a good book,' he informed America. (That didn't stop him hosting a quiz show, however.) Dirk Bogarde refused to appear on the smaller screen at all. 'I don't want my audience going for a piss or making tea while I work,' he reasoned. By the Seventies, satire had become Hollywood's favoured mode of attack. Writer Paddy Chayefski and director Sidney Lumet fashioned a masterpiece in Network (1976), complete with Peter Finch's immortal mantra 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!' It painted television as a medium so corrupt that it would exploit a man's nervous breakdown and screen his suicide in the name of ratings. And as it got harder and harder on television, Hollywood was noticeably soft on itself. With the possible exception of The Player (1992) - director Robert Altman genuinely loathes the movie business - satires about Hollywood tended to be of the ever-so-gently self-deprecating type. Sweet Liberty (1986), with Alan Alda directing and starring, The Big Picture (1989), directed by Christopher Guest and starring Kevin Bacon, and indie fare such as Tom DiCillo's Living In Oblivion (1994) all took a soft line. Hey, they said, Hollywood might be insane, corrupt and venal, but it's all just a bit of a laugh really. Things settled down a little in the Nineties. With the exception of The Truman Show and Natural Born Killers, movies about television tended to be gentle comedies (Soapdish, Groundhog Day) or soapish dramas (Broadcast News, Up Close And Personal). Part of the reason, no doubt, was that the major studios were now all heavily involved in producing television programmes themselves and cross-fertilising between the two media. Successful television series could be given the big screen treatment (The X Files, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Star Trek: The Next Generation) while failed movie projects could be transferred to the small screen and given a lucrative new lease of life (Buffy The Vampire Slayer). And although one of last year's Oscar Best Picture nominations, The Insider, was an intelligent expos\u00e9 of the vested interests within a US TV news network, it was the exception that proves the rule. All of which provokes the question: what rocked the apple cart? Why the sudden recommencement of hostilities? For a start there may be the creeping realisation that, in quality terms at least, television has been outperforming cinema for at least the past decade. Few big screen comedies have been as deftly written as Seinfeld, Frasier or The Simpsons at their best. It's difficult to find a cop movie as well acted as NYPD Blue or a crime thriller as compelling as Murder One. Then there's the small matter of Washington's avowed intent to clean up Hollywood. With censorious eyes from both main parties directed towards the movie business, now would be the perfect time to nod towards the small screen and its excesses. But most of all, movies like Series 7 and Fifteen Minutes point to the fact that with reality TV the small screen has come up with a format that movies can neither emulate nor top. While in drama and comedy the two are at least theoretically evenly matched, in this new arena Hollywood has no way of competing with its precocious younger relation. Satire is the only option. We should be worried. Only a few years ago the idea that audiences would tune into a show dedicated to watching the minutiae of everyday life from all angles was a ludicrous proposition aptly captured in Peter Weir's The Truman Show. Then came Big Brother, and the stuff of speculative satire became reality. The current vogue for reality TV is beyond satire, especially in the States. Imagine just a few years back pitching a show where long-term couples were separated and had their relationships deliberately tested (Temptation Island). Or a survival programme where the viewing highlight will be a middle-class group's clumsy attempts to slaughter a pig (Survivor). You'd have been laughed at. But it all came true. And with current formats running out of steam the last thing we need is some telly executive staring at a screening of Fifteen Minutes and wondering 'what if ...' Fifteen Minutes opens next Friday and Series 7 on 1 June. Official website is www.series7movie.com",

Wilder refused. But when Crowe's account of their meeting appeared in a diary about the making of Jerry Maguire that Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone, a friend of Wilder's, Karen Lerner, suggested a book along the lines of Truffaut's Hitchcock. She is credited as editorial consultant on the handsomely designed result. </p> <p>Unlike the chronological Truffaut-Hitchcock encounter, this is a rambling affair, jumping back and forth in time. But as the pair meet over two years in Wilder's spartan office, his luxurious home and restaurants, we observe the growing friendship between a young director and a maestro who has not made a movie in 20 years. </p> <p>This is a riveting book that captures Wilder's wary, puckish personality and razor-sharp mind bet ter than any other study, and there are nuggets on every page. We learn that the inspiration for his favourite film, The Apartment, came from the tryst at the friend's flat in Brief Encounter. To Wilder, Battleship Potemkin is 'the greatest movie ever made', Charles Laughton 'the greatest actor who ever lived', Dean Martin 'the funniest man in Hollywood'. He acknowledges Ernst Lubitsch as his chief influence and had the sign 'How would Lubitsch do it?' above his desk, and though he loathed working with Chandler he learnt from him 'what real dialogue is'. Bing Crosby ('the great stylist') he prefers to Sinatra.</p> <p>His two great regrets are not having worked with Cary Grant and not being able to direct Schindler's List as a memorial to his mother and other family members killed at Auschwitz. But he speaks warmly of Steven Spielberg's film, and is generously disposed to the younger generation of moviemakers while being generally pessimistic about the industry. Of his own aspirations he says, modestly, that 'it interested me to lift the taste of the average person, just lift it up a little bit'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Conversations with Wilder Cameron Crowe Faber \u00a312.99, pp376 Buy it at a discount at BOL This book began in 1995 when former rock journalist and then little known writer-director Cameron Crowe took Tom Cruise with him to persuade his idol, the 89-year-old Billy Wilder, to make a cameo appearance in Jerry Maguire. Wilder refused. But when Crowe's account of their meeting appeared in a diary about the making of Jerry Maguire that Crowe wrote for Rolling Stone, a friend of Wilder's, Karen Lerner, suggested a book along the lines of Truffaut's Hitchcock. She is credited as editorial consultant on the handsomely designed result. Unlike the chronological Truffaut-Hitchcock encounter, this is a rambling affair, jumping back and forth in time. But as the pair meet over two years in Wilder's spartan office, his luxurious home and restaurants, we observe the growing friendship between a young director and a maestro who has not made a movie in 20 years. This is a riveting book that captures Wilder's wary, puckish personality and razor-sharp mind bet ter than any other study, and there are nuggets on every page. We learn that the inspiration for his favourite film, The Apartment, came from the tryst at the friend's flat in Brief Encounter. To Wilder, Battleship Potemkin is 'the greatest movie ever made', Charles Laughton 'the greatest actor who ever lived', Dean Martin 'the funniest man in Hollywood'. He acknowledges Ernst Lubitsch as his chief influence and had the sign 'How would Lubitsch do it?' above his desk, and though he loathed working with Chandler he learnt from him 'what real dialogue is'. Bing Crosby ('the great stylist') he prefers to Sinatra. His two great regrets are not having worked with Cary Grant and not being able to direct Schindler's List as a memorial to his mother and other family members killed at Auschwitz. But he speaks warmly of Steven Spielberg's film, and is generously disposed to the younger generation of moviemakers while being generally pessimistic about the industry. Of his own aspirations he says, modestly, that 'it interested me to lift the taste of the average person, just lift it up a little bit'.",

      "body": "<p> In Septmber 1977 the Nasa spacecraft Voyager One blasted off on its historic unmanned mission to Jupiter and beyond. On board, the scientists, who knew that intrepid capsule would one day spin through distant star systems, had installed a recorded greeting from the people of the planet Earth. Preceding brief messages in 55 languages for any inhabitants of outer space, the gold-plated disc played (and still plays) a longish statement from the then secretary-general of the United Nations, an Austrian named Kurt Waldheim, speaking on behalf of 147 member states - in English. </p> <p>Twenty-five years ago, Nasa's choice of language was as controversial as the man who uttered its bland but historic sentences. Today it looks more than slightly prophetic. At the dawn of a new millennium, if ever a language had the right to represent the planet to distant galaxies, it is the language one that more and more commentators refer to as 'global English'. </p> <p>In the European Year of Languages, it's English that dominates not only the international scene - that's old news - but also, incredibly, the European linguistic map. If you put to any European the simple proposition that everyone should speak English, you probably would not be surprised to learn that 70 per cent of Britons and 82 per cent of Dutch people concur. You might raise an eyebrow at the 76 per cent of Italians who share this point of view. But you would be gobsmacked - dare I say boulevers\u00e9 ? - to discover that in France, home of that supremely civilising international force la langue Fran\u00e7aise, an astounding 66 per cent of those questioned in a Eurobarometer poll, said it would be a good idea if the people of Europe spoke English. </p> <p>OK, it's only a poll, but after decades of French government propaganda and even legislation in defence of the beleaguered French tongue, supported at the highest level by presidents of left and right from Giscard to Chirac (who always uses French to the 'Anglo-Saxon' media) it represents a jolt to French linguistic self-esteem. After the substitution by the French Academy of unequivocally French words for 'la langue du Coca-Cola\" (for example capitaux febriles for 'hot money', gros porteur for 'jumbo jet' and pr t \u00e0 manger ' for 'fast food'), the news that two-thirds of French people are now acknowledging the superior usefulness of English will come as a blow to those, like the late Georges Pompidou, who believed 'we must not let the idea take hold that English is the only possible instrument for industrial, economic and scientific communication'. </p> <p>'We've won the battle,' says Charles Tannuck, a Conservative MEP sitting in his office high in the European Parliament. He adds, as an afterthought: 'Though we have to thank Uncle Sam for this.' </p> <p>It's all happened so fast: 25 years ago the nascent global supremacy of English was inextricably bound up with US power and US technology. In hindsight, the high point of Anglo-American linguistic hegemony was the launch of the Voyager space probe with its message of 'peace and goodwill' for the people of outer space. From that moment, British and more particularly American English acquired a supranational momentum which has, so far, proved unstoppable. </p> <p>The speed with which this astonishing linguistic revolution has occurred mirrors the speed at which change in communications technology has transformed the world's media. Just 20 years ago, when I was involved in the making of a BBC television series about the evolution of English, The Story of English, there was no CNN, no online OED, no Wap phones and absolutely no world wide web. So anxious were we to avoid a historically suspect linguistic triumphalism that it was an unwritten production rule never to refer to our subject as 'the world's first global language', even though all the signs were there to read. In those far-off days we were excited to find European truck companies such as Iveco transacting business exclusively in English, or SAS and Air Italia pilots transmitting only in English, or those first, cumbersome personal computers storing data predominantly in English. Now, in the year 2001, all that seems rather quaint. </p> <p>If, as I have argued before in The Observer, we are living through a second Gutenberg Revolution, we are also the helpless, and possibly fortunate, witnesses to the apparent realisation of one of mankind's oldest and deepest dreams - the end of Babel. Or, to put it another way, the traditional language kaleidoscope - an entrancing, many coloured, fractured thing derived from the Greek kalos (beautiful) and eidos (form) - has become closer to something I'd want to christen a kal-anglo-scope. </p> <p>Look through the kalangloscope of global English and you will find Greek and Finnish translators at the European Commission in Brussels translating EU business from minority languages like Czech or Turkish via English. Down the road in the Parlia ment building you will find Dutch, Swedish, Spanish and Irish delegates arguing at the bar in English. At the Commission's headquarters, the Italian deputy head of President Prodi's private office likes to pepper his conversation with lines from Yes Minister. 'That was a courageous argument,' he will say, with a knowing wink to his mystified fellow Europeans. </p> <p>Charles Tannuck, a thoughtful Eurosceptic who actually speaks at least four European languages, says the MEPs who can't speak English in Brussels have a 'miserable time'. None of this, of course, means Europeans are abandoning their mother tongues - far from it - but it does strongly suggest that if there's an internationally acknowledged lingua franca it is English. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the world we find Israeli businessmen doing deals in English with European partners in Johannesburg, who will in turn pass on the terms and conditions of the contracts to their local Zulu-speaking South African subsidiaries. Turn the kalangloscope again, and we find European Commission civil servants defending fishing quotas with Basque tuna fishermen, then parrying inquiries from the Spanish media - all in English. And across the globe in the Philippines, the Estrada corruption trial was almost exclusively an English language affair. </p> <p>Focus the kalangloscope on Europe and you find that last year the Swiss-German cantons of Switzerland caused a local sensation when they voted to adopt English in place of French as their official second language, after German. </p> <p>In the world of the kalangloscope, presidential contenders, trades union leaders, terrorists, Nobel laureates, tennis players and independent film-makers all use English as the essential medium for putting their message across internationally. During the Nato intervention in Kosovo, the public face of the operation was conducted on all sides, even by the Serbs, in English. </p> <p>The Kosovo conflict is a reminder that, while there are many possible explanations for the recent emergence of the kalangloscope, the only one that matters is the sudden eclipse of Soviet power in the early 1990s. Overnight, the world moved from a situation of sustained superpower conflict to a condition of US superpower predominance. Just as in the early Middle Ages it was Latin, the language both of the defunct Roman Empire and of the resurgent and all-powerful Roman Catholic church, that held sway throughout Europe, so in the aftermath of the revolutions of 1989, it was American English, underpinned by US culture and fashion and US media, that carried the English language into the furthest corners of the globe. Blue jeans and Hollywood movies played their part in this, but it was Cruise missiles and Stealth bombers that became crucial to the process. Language has always been about power first, culture and learning second. A language, as the saying goes, is 'a dialect with an army and a navy'. </p> <p>In the aftermath of the Soviet collapse there was a global flight from the Russian language. Quickly, in countries as diverse as China, Russia and Brazil, the language most commonly taught as a foreign language became English. Parts of Europe formerly under Soviet domination - the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Romania - switched enthusiastically to English as a lingua franca. </p> <p>In strictly European terms this is not entirely logical.There are, for instance, far more German-speakers in the EU. But not only has German been shunned, in Germany itself there are now fears that English threatens the native tongue in the way it was once perceived to threaten French. In recent months a proposed 'language purification law' (against the invasion of English nouns, verbs and adjectives) has received widespread support from academics, linguists and politicians. This movement wants to impose hefty fines on any German caught using the bastardised tongue known as 'Denglisch'. Similar movements to defend the mother tongue from English are found in Spain and Brazil. </p> <p>'Flirt', 'baby', 'power', 'administration' and 'underwear' have become an everyday part of German vocabulary, joining other English imports such as 'kidnap', 'relax' and 'pick-up'. </p> <p>Senator Eckhart Werthebach, a conservative politician, is the moving spirit behind the Language Purification Law. He wants, he says, to protect German from extinction. 'Our language is being abandoned thanks to a growth in Americanisms. Older, less educated people, and foreigners living in Germany who don't speak English, are excluded,' he says. </p> <p>The Language Purification Law sounds bizarre, but it has popular backing. A recent magazine poll showed that 53 per cent of Germans are against the use of English words. Another survey showed that English words like 'shopping', 'happy', 'event' and 'statement' have largely cancelled out their German equivalents. English terms like 'slow-motion', 'last-minute' and 'highlights' have usurped homegrown words. Some of these expressions are based on comical German misunderstandings of English slang. In Denglisch a 'handy' is a 'mobile phone'. </p> <p>The German Language Union's chairman, Professor Walter Kramer, said: 'We protest at the totally one-sided takeover by English expressions.' </p> <p>In the European Union, German is one of the so-called 'working languages'. But virtually no one, apart from the poor old Germans, uses it. Even French, the traditional language of foreign affairs, is under pressure from English. A European parliamentarian like Charles Tannuck says he is keen 'not to destroy national culture' but a moment later will agree that for EU email 'the default language is always English'. </p> <p>Tannuck, who has thought deeply about the language question, is a far cry from the kind of Eurosceptic who displays photographs of RAF Spitfires on his office wall. He sees himself as a pragmatist. He says: 'If we want a really successful single market, all documents, all road signs, every piece of official information should be in English as well as in the national language.' </p> <p>He stresses the feasibility of this by pointing out that 75 per cent of European children are now learning English in school. This Eurosceptic says that, paradoxical as it may seem: 'If you believe in a strong European identity, English is vital.' He thinks it's time to put the language question on the political agenda - which would certainly make a change from the interminable debates about the euro. </p> <p> History is on his side. After the Nice summit, the planned enlargement of the EU to incorporate former Soviet-bloc countries such as Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria and Slovakia is going to deal a body blow to the use of the French language in community affairs. Steve Morris, a Commission spokesman, notes that English is now 'everybody's second language'. For the first time in the history of the EU, the Commission's spokesman, Jonathan Faull, is English. To illustrate the dominance of English, Morris says that he gave up going to his Italian language classes because he found his fellow students always answered him in English. He acknowledges that the language question is 'an emotive issue', but points out that, de facto, 'it's difficult to find somewhere in Europe where they don't speak English'. </p> <p>Away from the European heartland, the end of the Soviet imperium meant something else, too - the proliferation of small, independent states (Croatia and Bosnia, for example) which, while fiercely nationalistic about their mother tongues, have been only too eager to establish English As A Foreign Language on their campuses and in their business schools. Where, in the days of the USSR, there were fewer than 150 UN member states, now in the globalised world of the new century there are more than 180 UN member states for whom American English is the second language of choice after the mother tongue. </p> <p>The figures tell their own story. According to the best estimates available, English is now the first language of about 380 million mother tongue speakers, based in traditionally English-speaking countries such as Britain, Australia and the United States. Add to this approximately 350 million second language English speakers in countries like India, Nigeria and Singapore, and a staggering further 500-1,000 million people in countries like China, Japan and Russia that acknowledge the importance of global English as an agent of global capitalism, and you arrive at a total of nearly 2,000 million - at least a third of the world's population. It's further estimated that by 2050 no less than half the world's population will be competent in English. </p> <p>For these participants in the global kalangloscope the dominant tone is the American of American English. American English is a vast and complex subject that traces back to the landing of a few English-speaking settlers in Jamestown, Virginia, and then at Plimouth Rock in New England. The resulting marriage of unbridled, pioneering adventurism and straitlaced puritan simplicity was a variety of English that is both marvellously innovative and yet capable of a positively Calvinist precision and understatement. </p> <p>In its infancy, American English played wayward child to its unbending British parent. Later, as the British Empire, which had done so much to spread English across the globe, declined, the story of the English language became a tale of American world domination. In the spread of the American language - the forerunner of the global English kalangloscope - three agents were decisive. First, and most obvious, there is the contribution of US culture: Hollywood movies, the advertising of Madison Avenue and the newspapers and television channels of the great media corporations such as Time-Warner and CBS. A defining moment in the cultural imperialism of the US media giants occurred in 1983 when a nomadic, drought-plagued sub-Saharan tribe, the Tuareg, delayed its annual migration to fresh pasture by 10 days in order to catch the last episode of Dallas. </p> <p>Second, there's the role played by the scientific community in the dissemination of Anglo-American usage. Scientific endeavour, of course, transcends national boundaries, and scientific communication has fastened on English as the natural medium for the transmission of new ideas. More than half the world's scientific journals are in English. Hand in hand with science, the massive impact of the internet has been unimaginably important. Although there is now decisive evidence that English is being challenged on the net by other languages, the first decade of activity has been a familiar tale of English language domination (80 per cent of home pages on the web are in English, compared to 4.5 per cent German and 3.1 per cent Japanese.) </p> <p>Finally, there's trade and tourism. As Naomi Klein has shown in No Logo, multinational trade, tearing up frontier restrictions in a kind of capitalist hurricane, has spread English into the export processing zones of Far East Asia, into the sweatshops of Bangkok and Shanghai and into the hypermarkets of Japan and Korea. </p> <p>The commercial logic described in No Logo goes hand in hand with the package deal. Tourism and mass consumerism are opposite sides of the same coin. The language of Thomas Cook, of Mastercard and of Sheraton is English - in hundreds of thousands of kalangloscopic transactions every day. </p> <p>The success of English sometimes induces a kind of triumphalism that is inappropriate. If English today is a global phenomenon, this is due to non-linguistic forces, not because it has unique or special qualities. Despite the myths, English is, from some points of view, a spectacularly bad choice as the world's leading language. It is not easier to learn than French or Russian. It is not more beautiful, mellifluous or eloquent than Italian or German, or any other language. Such judgments are almost meaningless. Mellifluous for whom? </p> <p>English is, moreover, highly idiomatic. How do we begin to explain such phrases as 'put up with' or 'get on with it'? English also has some impossible characteristics. ' Th' is famously difficult for foreigners. There are some rare and difficult vowels: the vowel-sound in 'bird' and 'nurse' occurs in virtually no other language. The 13 spellings for a sound like sh - shoe, sugar, issue, mansion, mission, nation, suspicion, ocean, conscious, chaperon, schist, fuschia and pshaw - are a source of weakness, not strength. </p> <p>Weak or strong, global English now has a supranational momentum that has set it free from the political fates of Britain and the United States. The colossal global financial underpinning of the language ensures its continued supremacy. The estimated gross language product (GLP - the money generated by language-related commerce) of English is $7,815 billion, compared to $2,455bn for German and $1,789bn for Spanish. </p> <p>Even so, there are signs that a resurgent multilingualism will keep the spread of global English in check. David Crystal, a leading commentator on the English language, says you find 'a rampant multilingualism on the web. People are adopting English for intelligibility and their local language for identity.' </p> <p>This is an important development, possibly even a turning-point. Crystal and others have argued that one of the negative consequences of global English has been an acceleration of 'language death' - the disappearance of minority languages in predominantly English-speaking parts of the world. With the disappearance of some versions of, for instance, Maori languages the loss is not just linguistic. Language death means the slow obliteration of oral traditions - songs, folktales, rituals, proverbs - all of which add up to an invaluable legacy to humanity. In almost every quarter of the globe there are shocking examples of language death to be found. </p> <p>There are, of course, numerous contra-indications. In America some see Spanish as a real challenge to the primacy of English. Closer to home, Jack Straw recently publicised his efforts to acquire French, and, according to Labour MP Denis MacShane: 'Ministers have been told they must learn a foreign language if they are to do work for the Government in Europe.' </p> <p>What, then, is the future of the kalangloscope? Where will it end? Only one thing is certain: every prediction about the future of the English language has ultimately been proved to be wrong. If, in the year 1601, you had asked for odds on the global future of English you'd have been lucky to get 1,000-1. </p> <p>All we can say with confidence in the year 2001 is that, as participants in global English, in all its myriad manifestations, we are probably closer in spirit and self-expression to the Shakespearean extravaganza than at any time since the seventeenth century. Spoken and written, global English offers a medium of almost limitless potential and surprise. </p> <p><strong>Europeans on English</strong></p> <p><strong> Number of Europeans who think everyone should speak English:</strong> </p> <p>Dutch 82% </p> <p>Spanish 78% </p> <p>Austrians 64% </p> <p>French 66% </p> <p>Irish 62% </p> <p><strong> Number who think foreign language skills are useful:</strong> </p> <p>Danish 96% </p> <p>Greek 91% </p> <p>Finns 88% </p> <p>French 75% </p> <p>Germans 62% </p> <p><strong> 41 per cent of Europeans speak English, after their mother tongue</strong> </p> <p> Source: Eurobarometer</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Septmber 1977 the Nasa spacecraft Voyager One blasted off on its historic unmanned mission to Jupiter and beyond. On board, the scientists, who knew that intrepid capsule would one day spin through distant star systems, had installed a recorded greeting from the people of the planet Earth. Preceding brief messages in 55 languages for any inhabitants of outer space, the gold-plated disc played (and still plays) a longish statement from the then secretary-general of the United Nations, an Austrian named Kurt Waldheim, speaking on behalf of 147 member states - in English. Twenty-five years ago, Nasa's choice of language was as controversial as the man who uttered its bland but historic sentences. Today it looks more than slightly prophetic. At the dawn of a new millennium, if ever a language had the right to represent the planet to distant galaxies, it is the language one that more and more commentators refer to as 'global English'. In the European Year of Languages, it's English that dominates not only the international scene - that's old news - but also, incredibly, the European linguistic map. If you put to any European the simple proposition that everyone should speak English, you probably would not be surprised to learn that 70 per cent of Britons and 82 per cent of Dutch people concur. You might raise an eyebrow at the 76 per cent of Italians who share this point of view. But you would be gobsmacked - dare I say boulevers\u00e9 ? - to discover that in France, home of that supremely civilising international force la langue Fran\u00e7aise, an astounding 66 per cent of those questioned in a Eurobarometer poll, said it would be a good idea if the people of Europe spoke English. OK, it's only a poll, but after decades of French government propaganda and even legislation in defence of the beleaguered French tongue, supported at the highest level by presidents of left and right from Giscard to Chirac (who always uses French to the 'Anglo-Saxon' media) it represents a jolt to French linguistic self-esteem. After the substitution by the French Academy of unequivocally French words for 'la langue du Coca-Cola\" (for example capitaux febriles for 'hot money', gros porteur for 'jumbo jet' and pr t \u00e0 manger ' for 'fast food'), the news that two-thirds of French people are now acknowledging the superior usefulness of English will come as a blow to those, like the late Georges Pompidou, who believed 'we must not let the idea take hold that English is the only possible instrument for industrial, economic and scientific communication'. 'We've won the battle,' says Charles Tannuck, a Conservative MEP sitting in his office high in the European Parliament. He adds, as an afterthought: 'Though we have to thank Uncle Sam for this.' It's all happened so fast: 25 years ago the nascent global supremacy of English was inextricably bound up with US power and US technology. In hindsight, the high point of Anglo-American linguistic hegemony was the launch of the Voyager space probe with its message of 'peace and goodwill' for the people of outer space. From that moment, British and more particularly American English acquired a supranational momentum which has, so far, proved unstoppable. The speed with which this astonishing linguistic revolution has occurred mirrors the speed at which change in communications technology has transformed the world's media. Just 20 years ago, when I was involved in the making of a BBC television series about the evolution of English, The Story of English, there was no CNN, no online OED, no Wap phones and absolutely no world wide web. So anxious were we to avoid a historically suspect linguistic triumphalism that it was an unwritten production rule never to refer to our subject as 'the world's first global language', even though all the signs were there to read. In those far-off days we were excited to find European truck companies such as Iveco transacting business exclusively in English, or SAS and Air Italia pilots transmitting only in English, or those first, cumbersome personal computers storing data predominantly in English. Now, in the year 2001, all that seems rather quaint. If, as I have argued before in The Observer, we are living through a second Gutenberg Revolution, we are also the helpless, and possibly fortunate, witnesses to the apparent realisation of one of mankind's oldest and deepest dreams - the end of Babel. Or, to put it another way, the traditional language kaleidoscope - an entrancing, many coloured, fractured thing derived from the Greek kalos (beautiful) and eidos (form) - has become closer to something I'd want to christen a kal-anglo-scope. Look through the kalangloscope of global English and you will find Greek and Finnish translators at the European Commission in Brussels translating EU business from minority languages like Czech or Turkish via English. Down the road in the Parlia ment building you will find Dutch, Swedish, Spanish and Irish delegates arguing at the bar in English. At the Commission's headquarters, the Italian deputy head of President Prodi's private office likes to pepper his conversation with lines from Yes Minister. 'That was a courageous argument,' he will say, with a knowing wink to his mystified fellow Europeans. Charles Tannuck, a thoughtful Eurosceptic who actually speaks at least four European languages, says the MEPs who can't speak English in Brussels have a 'miserable time'. None of this, of course, means Europeans are abandoning their mother tongues - far from it - but it does strongly suggest that if there's an internationally acknowledged lingua franca it is English. Elsewhere in the world we find Israeli businessmen doing deals in English with European partners in Johannesburg, who will in turn pass on the terms and conditions of the contracts to their local Zulu-speaking South African subsidiaries. Turn the kalangloscope again, and we find European Commission civil servants defending fishing quotas with Basque tuna fishermen, then parrying inquiries from the Spanish media - all in English. And across the globe in the Philippines, the Estrada corruption trial was almost exclusively an English language affair. Focus the kalangloscope on Europe and you find that last year the Swiss-German cantons of Switzerland caused a local sensation when they voted to adopt English in place of French as their official second language, after German. In the world of the kalangloscope, presidential contenders, trades union leaders, terrorists, Nobel laureates, tennis players and independent film-makers all use English as the essential medium for putting their message across internationally. During the Nato intervention in Kosovo, the public face of the operation was conducted on all sides, even by the Serbs, in English. The Kosovo conflict is a reminder that, while there are many possible explanations for the recent emergence of the kalangloscope, the only one that matters is the sudden eclipse of Soviet power in the early 1990s. Overnight, the world moved from a situation of sustained superpower conflict to a condition of US superpower predominance. Just as in the early Middle Ages it was Latin, the language both of the defunct Roman Empire and of the resurgent and all-powerful Roman Catholic church, that held sway throughout Europe, so in the aftermath of the revolutions of 1989, it was American English, underpinned by US culture and fashion and US media, that carried the English language into the furthest corners of the globe. Blue jeans and Hollywood movies played their part in this, but it was Cruise missiles and Stealth bombers that became crucial to the process. Language has always been about power first, culture and learning second. A language, as the saying goes, is 'a dialect with an army and a navy'. In the aftermath of the Soviet collapse there was a global flight from the Russian language. Quickly, in countries as diverse as China, Russia and Brazil, the language most commonly taught as a foreign language became English. Parts of Europe formerly under Soviet domination - the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Romania - switched enthusiastically to English as a lingua franca. In strictly European terms this is not entirely logical.There are, for instance, far more German-speakers in the EU. But not only has German been shunned, in Germany itself there are now fears that English threatens the native tongue in the way it was once perceived to threaten French. In recent months a proposed 'language purification law' (against the invasion of English nouns, verbs and adjectives) has received widespread support from academics, linguists and politicians. This movement wants to impose hefty fines on any German caught using the bastardised tongue known as 'Denglisch'. Similar movements to defend the mother tongue from English are found in Spain and Brazil. 'Flirt', 'baby', 'power', 'administration' and 'underwear' have become an everyday part of German vocabulary, joining other English imports such as 'kidnap', 'relax' and 'pick-up'. Senator Eckhart Werthebach, a conservative politician, is the moving spirit behind the Language Purification Law. He wants, he says, to protect German from extinction. 'Our language is being abandoned thanks to a growth in Americanisms. Older, less educated people, and foreigners living in Germany who don't speak English, are excluded,' he says. The Language Purification Law sounds bizarre, but it has popular backing. A recent magazine poll showed that 53 per cent of Germans are against the use of English words. Another survey showed that English words like 'shopping', 'happy', 'event' and 'statement' have largely cancelled out their German equivalents. English terms like 'slow-motion', 'last-minute' and 'highlights' have usurped homegrown words. Some of these expressions are based on comical German misunderstandings of English slang. In Denglisch a 'handy' is a 'mobile phone'. The German Language Union's chairman, Professor Walter Kramer, said: 'We protest at the totally one-sided takeover by English expressions.' In the European Union, German is one of the so-called 'working languages'. But virtually no one, apart from the poor old Germans, uses it. Even French, the traditional language of foreign affairs, is under pressure from English. A European parliamentarian like Charles Tannuck says he is keen 'not to destroy national culture' but a moment later will agree that for EU email 'the default language is always English'. Tannuck, who has thought deeply about the language question, is a far cry from the kind of Eurosceptic who displays photographs of RAF Spitfires on his office wall. He sees himself as a pragmatist. He says: 'If we want a really successful single market, all documents, all road signs, every piece of official information should be in English as well as in the national language.' He stresses the feasibility of this by pointing out that 75 per cent of European children are now learning English in school. This Eurosceptic says that, paradoxical as it may seem: 'If you believe in a strong European identity, English is vital.' He thinks it's time to put the language question on the political agenda - which would certainly make a change from the interminable debates about the euro. History is on his side. After the Nice summit, the planned enlargement of the EU to incorporate former Soviet-bloc countries such as Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria and Slovakia is going to deal a body blow to the use of the French language in community affairs. Steve Morris, a Commission spokesman, notes that English is now 'everybody's second language'. For the first time in the history of the EU, the Commission's spokesman, Jonathan Faull, is English. To illustrate the dominance of English, Morris says that he gave up going to his Italian language classes because he found his fellow students always answered him in English. He acknowledges that the language question is 'an emotive issue', but points out that, de facto, 'it's difficult to find somewhere in Europe where they don't speak English'. Away from the European heartland, the end of the Soviet imperium meant something else, too - the proliferation of small, independent states (Croatia and Bosnia, for example) which, while fiercely nationalistic about their mother tongues, have been only too eager to establish English As A Foreign Language on their campuses and in their business schools. Where, in the days of the USSR, there were fewer than 150 UN member states, now in the globalised world of the new century there are more than 180 UN member states for whom American English is the second language of choice after the mother tongue. The figures tell their own story. According to the best estimates available, English is now the first language of about 380 million mother tongue speakers, based in traditionally English-speaking countries such as Britain, Australia and the United States. Add to this approximately 350 million second language English speakers in countries like India, Nigeria and Singapore, and a staggering further 500-1,000 million people in countries like China, Japan and Russia that acknowledge the importance of global English as an agent of global capitalism, and you arrive at a total of nearly 2,000 million - at least a third of the world's population. It's further estimated that by 2050 no less than half the world's population will be competent in English. For these participants in the global kalangloscope the dominant tone is the American of American English. American English is a vast and complex subject that traces back to the landing of a few English-speaking settlers in Jamestown, Virginia, and then at Plimouth Rock in New England. The resulting marriage of unbridled, pioneering adventurism and straitlaced puritan simplicity was a variety of English that is both marvellously innovative and yet capable of a positively Calvinist precision and understatement. In its infancy, American English played wayward child to its unbending British parent. Later, as the British Empire, which had done so much to spread English across the globe, declined, the story of the English language became a tale of American world domination. In the spread of the American language - the forerunner of the global English kalangloscope - three agents were decisive. First, and most obvious, there is the contribution of US culture: Hollywood movies, the advertising of Madison Avenue and the newspapers and television channels of the great media corporations such as Time-Warner and CBS. A defining moment in the cultural imperialism of the US media giants occurred in 1983 when a nomadic, drought-plagued sub-Saharan tribe, the Tuareg, delayed its annual migration to fresh pasture by 10 days in order to catch the last episode of Dallas. Second, there's the role played by the scientific community in the dissemination of Anglo-American usage. Scientific endeavour, of course, transcends national boundaries, and scientific communication has fastened on English as the natural medium for the transmission of new ideas. More than half the world's scientific journals are in English. Hand in hand with science, the massive impact of the internet has been unimaginably important. Although there is now decisive evidence that English is being challenged on the net by other languages, the first decade of activity has been a familiar tale of English language domination (80 per cent of home pages on the web are in English, compared to 4.5 per cent German and 3.1 per cent Japanese.) Finally, there's trade and tourism. As Naomi Klein has shown in No Logo, multinational trade, tearing up frontier restrictions in a kind of capitalist hurricane, has spread English into the export processing zones of Far East Asia, into the sweatshops of Bangkok and Shanghai and into the hypermarkets of Japan and Korea. The commercial logic described in No Logo goes hand in hand with the package deal. Tourism and mass consumerism are opposite sides of the same coin. The language of Thomas Cook, of Mastercard and of Sheraton is English - in hundreds of thousands of kalangloscopic transactions every day. The success of English sometimes induces a kind of triumphalism that is inappropriate. If English today is a global phenomenon, this is due to non-linguistic forces, not because it has unique or special qualities.

How do we begin to explain such phrases as 'put up with' or 'get on with it'? English also has some impossible characteristics. ' Th' is famously difficult for foreigners. There are some rare and difficult vowels: the vowel-sound in 'bird' and 'nurse' occurs in virtually no other language. The 13 spellings for a sound like sh - shoe, sugar, issue, mansion, mission, nation, suspicion, ocean, conscious, chaperon, schist, fuschia and pshaw - are a source of weakness, not strength. Weak or strong, global English now has a supranational momentum that has set it free from the political fates of Britain and the United States. The colossal global financial underpinning of the language ensures its continued supremacy.

      "body": "<p>There are undoubtedly three people in John Bayley's marriage to Audi Villers; that's the beauty of it. The ever-present other woman is Iris Murdoch, Bayley's first wife. When she died, just over two years ago, Bayley had no plans for a new life. He had spent the previous five years caring for her as she lost her extraordinary mind to Alzheimer's and, at 74, he wanted to turn in on himself, needed nothing fresh from the world - 'In so far as I had any feelings about the future after Iris had gone,' he says, characteristically chuckling a little to himself about the bleakest moment of his life. 'I thought of it as being quite blank and quiet, and I rather looked forward to that. Seeing nobody, going nowhere, doing nothing at all.' </p> <p>That, within a year, he should have committed himself to another relationship perhaps says something about John Bayley, but it suggests more, he believes, about the fact of being a widower. In their 43 years of marriage, and particularly latterly when her illness had warned people away, Iris had proved, for her husband, 'a formidable bulwark against life outside'. After she was gone, he found that rather than being left to enjoy his emptiness and silence, 'outside' crowded in on him. His widower's house, the subject of the third volume of an impromptu trilogy about life with and without Iris, was 'sieged' by friends and well-wishers and admirers wanting to take Bayley in hand, tidy him up, and even - he confides, alarmed - share his bed. Marriage seemed once more the best defence against unwanted fuss. And so, partly as a way of insulating himself again to the world, he proposed to Audi, a long-time companion and friend to both him and Iris, and - appropriately - the inheritor of a small fortune made from the patent to electric blankets. </p> <p>They have, he says, a good deal in common - 'I mean, Audi and I talk incessantly about Iris; never stop, really. It's our favourite subject, if you like' - and the match was not without romance. When the idea of marriage came to him, they were outside Audi's house in Lanzarote - a place she had built with her late husband, Borys - where Murdoch and Bayley had been regular visitors for 30 years; they had walked out into the moonlight to see the spectral white flowers of a particular cactus, which bloom for one night only and are gone by the morning. Looking at the otherworldy plant, Bayley, as he describes in his book, had a sudden vision of time past and time future: 'We stood hand in hand in the silence while the light from Audi's torch stole about among the gigantic ghost blooms,' he writes, 'bowing and shaking in the night wind. Gazing at them, spellbound, I was back at the beginning of the year. The flowers were like a dance of the blessed spirits. I didn't believe in blessed spirits, but I believed that Iris was with me once more, joining us and making us three in the warm breath of the night...' </p> <p>Was his heart in his mouth when he popped the question for a second time? </p> <p>Not quite, he says, tickled, 'but I was absolutely thrilled when Audi said she thought it was a good idea'. </p> <p>Having both previously been married in register offices, they did the ceremony properly this time. 'I bought her a big wedding dress in Oxford, from a shop called Pronuptia, which she rather liked,' Bayley recalls, 'and then we went off on a little kind of honeymoon to Iceland - Audi has a great interest in volcanoes.' His new wife, he says, who is 17 years his junior, is forever quoting to him something he said on the second day of that trip, and laughing uproariously: 'I said: \"You know, I don't think I've ever missed Iris quite as much as I do right now...\"' Bayley giggles, or rather - his manner is entirely that of an antique fictional character - chortles at the wonderful inappropriateness of the comment. 'It was just that I felt she would have been the perfect person to have around with us to see it all,' he says. </p> <p>When I wonder, obviously, if he is concerned at all that the ghost of Iris might get in the way of his relationship with Audi, he looks at me as if this is the first time the question has even occurred to him. </p> <p>'Oh no no no. Certainly not,' he says, gently and resolutely. 'Iris and Audi are completely different, for a start. We talk the whole time, even more than Iris and I talked. I mean, Audi is a natural talker, though she's somewhat dyslexic when it comes to writing. I adored Iris's silence, and I like very much that Audi is a talker; I find it equally relaxing.' </p> <p>You can tell how well things are going in this new life by glancing around Bayley's kitchen, where, he says, he prefers to stay all the time. The room is exactly as it was when Iris was alive, which is to say it is a still life with sherry bottles and Pringles tubes (the professor's twin staples); no surface is without a pile of diaries and notebooks, or a clutter of postcards and paintings, or dead and dying pot plants, or dubious things stored in coffee jars, old bowls of porridge and pots of pickles, foreign editions of Iris's books, manuscripts of volumes on Alzheimer's, piles of literary reviews and newspapers. There is a peg for flat caps, and one for ties, most of them still knotted. </p> <p>When Audi comes here - she still spends a good deal of her time in Lanzarote - she only goes through the motions of cleaning up. 'She's very tactful,' Bayley says. 'She respects my house and I respect her house. I mean, Iris and I just had a complete understanding about how we wanted to live. Audi's anxious not to be a literal kind of new broom.' </p> <p> One of the great virtues of the way in which Bayley and Murdoch wanted to live was their determination to preserve their singular lives within their shared space, like 'two animals in a field', as Bayley is fond of saying. 'We would both work away and never disturb the other,' he explains of their writing and reading habits. 'I loved the idea that somewhere in the house, the great engine of Iris's mind was whirring away.' </p> <p>To the delight of their friends, the pair adopted a similar attitude to their home: they let it do its thing, tried not to interfere too much. In a wonderful 'Room of my Own' piece in The Observer, just before Iris started to lose her mind, they wandered around this kitchen, peering into their primary-coloured cupboards with a sense of heightened childlike curiosity, wondering what they might unearth. Once, Bayley recalls, a large and rather expensive pork pie inexplicably went missing here. Though he and Iris searched and, over the years, always half expected its re-emergence, it has not yet turned up. </p> <p>Originally, some of this cosy anti-domesticity seems to have derived from Iris's fear of the institution of marriage itself. She dreaded anything, particularly routine, getting in the way of her writing, and consoled herself with the thought that theirs might be the kind of relationship that preserved surprise. Bayley recalls his first wife's stubborn vision of a marriage in which, as she used to say, 'I imagined you coming home in the evening, and me running down and saying: \"Oh, darling, such excitement, the badgers have broken in.\"' (Early in their life together, at her insistence, Bayley bought his wife a sewing box, which she kept unopened on her writing desk, a source of some amusement to them both.) </p> <p>I wonder if their domestic disarray had been established over the years, or if it had emerged fully formed. </p> <p>'I think it came almost at once,' Bayley says, thinking back. 'We seemed to know it by instinct, just as we knew that I liked to do a bit of cooking, and she didn't.' </p> <p>(Among his Oxford friends and colleagues, Bayley is a famously experimental chef; he once described some of his revolutionary methods to Harpers &amp; Queen : 'Boil eggs in an electric kettle and then use the water for Nescaf\u00e9,' he suggested. 'Or try Heath Robinson Pasta, which only needs one saucepan, a tin of spinach, some nests of vermicelli, olive oil, shavings of mild English cheddar, nuggets of garlic and boiling water. Shove everything in, and cook for eight minutes, stirring occasionally...') </p> <p>One of the errors made by the kind-hearted and misguided women who sought to 'rescue' Bayley after Iris died was to mistake his curious habits for neglect: they tried, as he relates in his book, to cook him casseroles, wash his charity-shop sweaters, replace (as well as get inside) his greying undergarments. Though the twin tormentors he describes, 'Margot' and 'Mella', are largely fictional constructs, 'both very real and very unreal', and 'the whole thing is greatly exaggerated... it is true,' he says, 'that I suddenly felt that as a widower anyone can get at your life and there is not much you can do about it. Which for someone like me is an alarming sensation. I think it was EM Forster who wrote that the thing about marriage is that a soundless glass bell descends over the two betrothed and no one hears of them again. I rather like that idea...' </p> <p> Talking to Bayley you find yourself occasionally forgetting, like Margot and Mella, that his is a remarkable interrogative mind. In his dusty home, with his stutter and his gift for self-deprecation, he seems like a favourite shuffling uncle; I am tempted to speak slowly and shout a little to make myself understood. One friend, AN Wilson, who was once guilty of an inadvertent condescension to his former tutor, found himself brought up sharply by the then-lucid Iris, who told him, with a steely look from under her straight fringe, that he might care to remember that her husband was perhaps the 'greatest critic since Coleridge'. </p> <p>Bayley, born in Lahore to a military family and educated at Eton, was for 30 years the Warton Professor of English at Oxford. At a time when the study of literature was becoming a kind of hi-tech business, he stuck resolutely to the notion that a great critic was first and foremost an inspired and humane reader. However, despite his exacting insight into Pushkin and Housman and Conrad, among others, he is more than happy that it will be for his trilogy about his wife's illness that he will be best remembered. In some ways, the books are a culmination of a life of acute reading; their unadorned prose carries an effortless weight of allusion and emotional insight. Willingly trapped by Iris's dependency, Bayley would find Shakespeare in his head. Up all night trying to persuade his mithered wife to come to bed, he'd think of the lines from Lear: 'Let's away to prison - we two alone will sing like birds in a cage...' In the course of writing the current book, it is to the poems Thomas Hardy dedicated to his first wife Emma that Bayley has returned. </p> <p>In that other quietly obsessive widower's poetry, he says he has felt something of a sense of kinship. 'The great emotion in those poems,' he suggests, arguing against my suggestion that they were born of guilt, 'is rather of Hardy's liberated sense of the possibilities of the writing, of \"I can now say exactly what I like and what I feel.\" In death even, it seems, he was grateful that his wife had given him this gift. In a way, it is the best thing you can possibly leave to a writer: a wonderful subject.' </p> <p>Partly for this reason, Bayley has no qualms, he says, about having turned the intimacies he shared with his late wife into something so very public, an industry almost. 'We really were secretive,' he says, 'but as you get older you anyway sort of cast shame aside.' Though he knows that some of Iris's friends felt he should not have written about her, he has no worries at all that she would have approved: 'She always encouraged me to do what I thought best,' he says. 'So I have no doubts about that. None at all.' </p> <p> The other impulse in the writing was a kind of therapy, both for himself and for other sufferers and their carers ('hateful word'), and one of the triumphs of his books - and his life - is the way he has made Iris's illness, the noble mind overthrown, something natural and of a piece with what had gone before. This conviction - of a kind of 'marriage of true minds' - allowed him, for example, to laugh a little at the alienating horrors of the onset of the illness when, at a talk she was due to give in Oxford about her work, instead of discussing her novels Iris stood up and 'smiled sweetly and began to sing an Elizabethan madrigal by Orlando Gibbons called \"The Silver Swan\"'. When she died, it enabled him to sit by her and play with her eyelids for a while, opening and shutting them and, when he went home, back to his widower's house for the first time, to feel, having felt his wife's last breath, 'like someone who had the good luck to be there when a really rare bird appeared'. </p> <p>Bayley says he does not regret the fact that their marriage was childless. Iris, he says, had known all along that she did not want children and he was happy to go along with that. But, looking back, he accepts, that 'though I wasn't in the least conscious of it', her illness perhaps released paternal feelings in him. In prophetic words, Bayley once remarked that 'one of the pleasures of marriage is looking after someone rather than being looked after'. His routine in the last five years would be, after feeding her a supper of baked beans or ice cream or mashed banana, to put his wife to bed at 8pm and have a little 'hermit space' to himself. His days were spent on walks on which she hoarded fragments - leaves and stones - to bring home. He would watch Teletubbies with her, try to painstakingly explain old jokes, and they would chatter away happily together in their private language of animal noises, their communication, as he wrote, like the sonar of whales: 'bouncing pulsations off each other and listening for echoes'. </p> <p>Right up to the end, he maintained his faith that his love would protect his wife. Sometimes this faith was tried severely. In the latest memoir he describes how, out driving with Iris one night, he looked across to the passenger seat and discovered she was not there; she had undone her safety belt and, on a bend, rolled out of the car. In the country darkness Bayley crawled through the undergrowth looking for her; he eventually found her underneath a hedge, calling out quietly to him. 'Even towards the end,' he says, 'I was pretty confident that Iris would never deliberately harm herself. I mean, she often tried to escape and one or two times she did get out and would wander off, but I think she would never have deliberately put herself in harm's way, that the self-preservation instinct survives to the end.' </p> <p>Having lived so close to Iris's illness, does he now live in fear of losing his own mind? </p> <p>'I'm quite sure that I won't,' he says. 'I think, in a way, you always know whether you might. I think Iris was always aware of the possibility. It was partly her mother, you know - she didn't have Alzheimer's but she was rather mad, in a way, though I was extremely fond of her.' </p> <p>Another part of the clue to his wife's 'let ting go' of her reason, he believes, lay in her extraordinarily sympathetic imagination, which earlier had allowed her to inhabit so fully the lives of her 22 novels. He suggests that Iris was, in a way, always slightly semi-detached from her consciousness: 'She was very interested in Buddhism, she had that side to her, and she was always fascinated, you know, by that kind of faith.' </p> <p>Does he have any of that interest himself? </p> <p>He laughs. 'No no no not at all. Not religious. I like to regard myself as a Church of England person, but I have no religion at all. Audi and I go to church in Lanzarote, and she's very devout, too, without being religious in any way. When she rang up last she said: \"I've just had the imposition of ashes,\" and I said \"How nice, congratulations.\"' </p> <p> If Bayley has a faith, it is, he says, in the power of language. Having watched his wife's syntax disintegrate, he now finds himself obsessively returning to the novels, rediscovering that brain in all its glory. </p> <p>'When the books came out originally, I always read them, of course, often with great admiration, but I never talked much to Iris about them, because she never really wanted to talk about them. Also,' he says, 'when you are living so close to someone, because you know them so well, it's quite hard to take what they do, their work, so to speak, seriously. But after she died, I really started to read them all compulsively. I used to think the attitude she took to her books rather splendid: she'd be in the middle of a novel and she'd say, \"Oh I don't think this one is much good, but better luck next time!\" She was like a gambler, you know, there was always another roll of the dice.' </p> <p>The person he now finds in the novels, he says, is not the woman he lived with all those years, but that does not surprise him. He weighs the writer against his recollections and tries to conjure the whole Iris. Soon after she died, memory became both a 'cool river', he says, 'into which he could plunge' and 'like a cancer eating away the present'. </p> <p>In among this weight of memories, though, with the help of Audi, he is slowly re-establishing a future. Having divorced himself from college life in the final years of Iris's illness, he now goes in to St Catherine's once or twice a week 'and I even do a bit of teaching, which I rather enjoy'. He talks with some optimism of a film that Richard Eyre plans to make of his books, though he doubts that it will have all that much to do with reality. 'I mean, they never do, do they?' </p> <p>Who does he imagine playing him? </p> <p>He wouldn't know, he says, but he thinks Judi Dench 'genuinely is rather like Iris'. </p> <p>Having confronted his wife's death, he is now entirely unconcerned about his own. As a carer, he says, 'you stop fearing it entirely. Partly because it seems like a natural thing, and partly because you feel, well, \"I wouldn't mind going. I'm ready, too.\"' </p> <p>Does he still feel that now? 'In a sense I do,' he chuckles, 'but only in a very serene way. I mean, all the stoic philosophers have always suggested that you should be prepared for death, and once you come to a certain age I think you are. Or I am, anyway.' </p> <p>And what does Audi think about that? 'Well,' he says, laughing, 'I sometimes tease her and ask her what her third husband will be like. I think she rather likes the idea...' </p> <p>And then he gets up as if he remembered something, looks at his watch, changes his cap, makes his apologies about leaving the photographer and me to lock up, and wanders off to a lunch appointment, blinking a little in the early spring sunshine.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are undoubtedly three people in John Bayley's marriage to Audi Villers; that's the beauty of it. The ever-present other woman is Iris Murdoch, Bayley's first wife. When she died, just over two years ago, Bayley had no plans for a new life. He had spent the previous five years caring for her as she lost her extraordinary mind to Alzheimer's and, at 74, he wanted to turn in on himself, needed nothing fresh from the world - 'In so far as I had any feelings about the future after Iris had gone,' he says, characteristically chuckling a little to himself about the bleakest moment of his life. 'I thought of it as being quite blank and quiet, and I rather looked forward to that. Seeing nobody, going nowhere, doing nothing at all.' That, within a year, he should have committed himself to another relationship perhaps says something about John Bayley, but it suggests more, he believes, about the fact of being a widower. In their 43 years of marriage, and particularly latterly when her illness had warned people away, Iris had proved, for her husband, 'a formidable bulwark against life outside'. After she was gone, he found that rather than being left to enjoy his emptiness and silence, 'outside' crowded in on him. His widower's house, the subject of the third volume of an impromptu trilogy about life with and without Iris, was 'sieged' by friends and well-wishers and admirers wanting to take Bayley in hand, tidy him up, and even - he confides, alarmed - share his bed. Marriage seemed once more the best defence against unwanted fuss. And so, partly as a way of insulating himself again to the world, he proposed to Audi, a long-time companion and friend to both him and Iris, and - appropriately - the inheritor of a small fortune made from the patent to electric blankets. They have, he says, a good deal in common - 'I mean, Audi and I talk incessantly about Iris; never stop, really. It's our favourite subject, if you like' - and the match was not without romance. When the idea of marriage came to him, they were outside Audi's house in Lanzarote - a place she had built with her late husband, Borys - where Murdoch and Bayley had been regular visitors for 30 years; they had walked out into the moonlight to see the spectral white flowers of a particular cactus, which bloom for one night only and are gone by the morning. Looking at the otherworldy plant, Bayley, as he describes in his book, had a sudden vision of time past and time future: 'We stood hand in hand in the silence while the light from Audi's torch stole about among the gigantic ghost blooms,' he writes, 'bowing and shaking in the night wind. Gazing at them, spellbound, I was back at the beginning of the year. The flowers were like a dance of the blessed spirits. I didn't believe in blessed spirits, but I believed that Iris was with me once more, joining us and making us three in the warm breath of the night...' Was his heart in his mouth when he popped the question for a second time? Not quite, he says, tickled, 'but I was absolutely thrilled when Audi said she thought it was a good idea'. Having both previously been married in register offices, they did the ceremony properly this time. 'I bought her a big wedding dress in Oxford, from a shop called Pronuptia, which she rather liked,' Bayley recalls, 'and then we went off on a little kind of honeymoon to Iceland - Audi has a great interest in volcanoes.' His new wife, he says, who is 17 years his junior, is forever quoting to him something he said on the second day of that trip, and laughing uproariously: 'I said: \"You know, I don't think I've ever missed Iris quite as much as I do right now...\"' Bayley giggles, or rather - his manner is entirely that of an antique fictional character - chortles at the wonderful inappropriateness of the comment. 'It was just that I felt she would have been the perfect person to have around with us to see it all,' he says. When I wonder, obviously, if he is concerned at all that the ghost of Iris might get in the way of his relationship with Audi, he looks at me as if this is the first time the question has even occurred to him. 'Oh no no no. Certainly not,' he says, gently and resolutely. 'Iris and Audi are completely different, for a start. We talk the whole time, even more than Iris and I talked. I mean, Audi is a natural talker, though she's somewhat dyslexic when it comes to writing. I adored Iris's silence, and I like very much that Audi is a talker; I find it equally relaxing.' You can tell how well things are going in this new life by glancing around Bayley's kitchen, where, he says, he prefers to stay all the time. The room is exactly as it was when Iris was alive, which is to say it is a still life with sherry bottles and Pringles tubes (the professor's twin staples); no surface is without a pile of diaries and notebooks, or a clutter of postcards and paintings, or dead and dying pot plants, or dubious things stored in coffee jars, old bowls of porridge and pots of pickles, foreign editions of Iris's books, manuscripts of volumes on Alzheimer's, piles of literary reviews and newspapers. There is a peg for flat caps, and one for ties, most of them still knotted. When Audi comes here - she still spends a good deal of her time in Lanzarote - she only goes through the motions of cleaning up. 'She's very tactful,' Bayley says. 'She respects my house and I respect her house. I mean, Iris and I just had a complete understanding about how we wanted to live. Audi's anxious not to be a literal kind of new broom.' One of the great virtues of the way in which Bayley and Murdoch wanted to live was their determination to preserve their singular lives within their shared space, like 'two animals in a field', as Bayley is fond of saying. 'We would both work away and never disturb the other,' he explains of their writing and reading habits. 'I loved the idea that somewhere in the house, the great engine of Iris's mind was whirring away.' To the delight of their friends, the pair adopted a similar attitude to their home: they let it do its thing, tried not to interfere too much. In a wonderful 'Room of my Own' piece in The Observer, just before Iris started to lose her mind, they wandered around this kitchen, peering into their primary-coloured cupboards with a sense of heightened childlike curiosity, wondering what they might unearth. Once, Bayley recalls, a large and rather expensive pork pie inexplicably went missing here. Though he and Iris searched and, over the years, always half expected its re-emergence, it has not yet turned up. Originally, some of this cosy anti-domesticity seems to have derived from Iris's fear of the institution of marriage itself. She dreaded anything, particularly routine, getting in the way of her writing, and consoled herself with the thought that theirs might be the kind of relationship that preserved surprise. Bayley recalls his first wife's stubborn vision of a marriage in which, as she used to say, 'I imagined you coming home in the evening, and me running down and saying: \"Oh, darling, such excitement, the badgers have broken in.\"' (Early in their life together, at her insistence, Bayley bought his wife a sewing box, which she kept unopened on her writing desk, a source of some amusement to them both.) I wonder if their domestic disarray had been established over the years, or if it had emerged fully formed. 'I think it came almost at once,' Bayley says, thinking back. 'We seemed to know it by instinct, just as we knew that I liked to do a bit of cooking, and she didn't.' (Among his Oxford friends and colleagues, Bayley is a famously experimental chef; he once described some of his revolutionary methods to Harpers &amp; Queen : 'Boil eggs in an electric kettle and then use the water for Nescaf\u00e9,' he suggested. 'Or try Heath Robinson Pasta, which only needs one saucepan, a tin of spinach, some nests of vermicelli, olive oil, shavings of mild English cheddar, nuggets of garlic and boiling water. Shove everything in, and cook for eight minutes, stirring occasionally...') One of the errors made by the kind-hearted and misguided women who sought to 'rescue' Bayley after Iris died was to mistake his curious habits for neglect: they tried, as he relates in his book, to cook him casseroles, wash his charity-shop sweaters, replace (as well as get inside) his greying undergarments. Though the twin tormentors he describes, 'Margot' and 'Mella', are largely fictional constructs, 'both very real and very unreal', and 'the whole thing is greatly exaggerated... it is true,' he says, 'that I suddenly felt that as a widower anyone can get at your life and there is not much you can do about it. Which for someone like me is an alarming sensation. I think it was EM Forster who wrote that the thing about marriage is that a soundless glass bell descends over the two betrothed and no one hears of them again. I rather like that idea...'

Later, he managed Marc Bolan for a while, then dabbled in punk before steering Japan to success. </p> <p>But perhaps the pinnacle of his career was getting his group Wham! to be the first Western group to play in China, a publicity coup that made the duo household names worldwide. Just a few weeks away from his sixty-second birthday, he still has projects on the go. This week sees the debut British single by his latest prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Alsou, a pretty 17-year-old Britney soundalike who is already a massive star in her native Russia. </p> <p>Napier-Bell is a manager. He sorts things for people. So, when I realise I've come to meet him without my tape recorder, he immediately takes control. Before I can finish my apologies, he's postponed his next interview and we're in his car cruising around west London to buy a replacement. He's a charming man, covering my embarrassment with a stream of enjoyable stories too libellous to repeat here. The lawyers, he says regretfully, cut some of the best bits out of his new book, Black Vinyl, White Powder, a string of lively anecdotes and personal experiences shoehorned somewhat uncomfortably into a more general history of the music business and its excesses. Nothing big had to go, he says, just a detail here, a punch line there. 'Anyone who dies between now and next year goes back in the paperback.' </p> <p>He's also annoyed that the Mail on Sunday, while serialising his book, took the sections referring to the rise of ecstasy in the late 1980s/early 1990s, added references to Peter Mandelson, John Prescott and Cherie Blair and, under the headline 'Ministry of Drugs', seemed to imply that James Palumbo's Ministry of Sound club was still some hotbed of drugs activity. </p> <p>Anyone who has been frisked by Ministry's bouncers will know this isn't so and, besides, Palumbo is a friend. Napier-Bell tells me a story from a business trip they made together to Thailand, where Palumbo ate raw jellyfish to psyche out a potential new business partner. After Napier-Bell and his publishers complained, the Mail on Sunday dropped the second instalment. 'I wasn't a bit sorry,' he wrote in a piece for the Telegraph 's media section last week. </p> <p>Though full of repeatable stories, the new book lacks the flippant charm of his first music business expos\u00e9. Published in 1982, You Don't Have To Say You Love Me shocked critics at the time with its casual references to drugs, homosexuality, chart-fixing and the stories in which Who drummer Keith Moon ended up saving the author from sticky situations in brothels. Twice. </p> <p>Napier-Bell readily agrees, saying he found the research for this longer book tedious, but then he's never been shy of admitting his mistakes. Some of the funniest parts of the new book concern his failures. He encouraged Marc Bolan to join a band called John's Children, an atrocious outfit he managed in a misguided attempt to cash in on flower power. Looking for a Latin singer, he rejected Julio Iglesias in favour of a terminally mean singer called Junior. He managed Culture Club's Jon Moss, but only when he was in an appalling punk band called London. Failures are always funny, he says, and besides, 'in between I got a few winners'. </p> <p>Simon Napier-Bell was born in Ealing. His father was a documentary film-maker and a life-long communist, even though he left the party after the tanks rolled into Hungary. The family moved around a lot, and Simon was educated in a mixture of state and public schools, depending on how the finances were going at the time. Too posh for state schools, too common for public schools. As he moved from one to the other, he was constantly bullied and had to learn to adjust his accent and behaviour to fit in. </p> <p>It was, he says now, perfect training for pop management, which in the 1960s required a certain chameleon-like quality. 'Ninety per cent of all the middle to senior staff in record companies were upper class. They found it very difficult to talk or deal with the artists.' This, he feels, is why so many of the successful managers of this period were gay. From the same class as the record company staff, they were equally at home with the kind of alternative lifestyles their artists often pursued. 'You're leading a double life all the time. Which is why, of course, the other people who are very good are Jewish.' </p> <p>Napier-Bell's own sexuality has always been flexible. His current boyfriend is Thai; they've been together 11 years and he remains grateful to New Labour for making changes in the immigration rules that finally allowed them to live together in London. But he says it's sheer coincidence that the three major relationships of his life have been with men. 'I've always had sex with women as well. What I like is feminine men or self-sufficient women. All my life it's just been a certain type of person. It's of no interest to me what gender they are.' </p> <p>Once, over lunch in 1966, he and his friend, Vicki Wickham, decided to get married. They were going to the premiere of Alfie that night, and would announce it at the party afterwards. 'I was the manager of the Yardbirds, she was the producer of Ready Steady Go. It would have been a big showbusiness marriage. We'd have big Sunday lunches with all our mutual friends; she could have her girlfriends and I'd have my boyfriends and where they overlapped, which they sometimes did, it would be no problem. And if we decided to have kids, we'd have kids. It was a brilliant idea.' </p> <p>On the way to the party, Wickham stopped off to break the news to a girlfriend. Furniture flew. By the time they got into town, the party was over and so was the engagement. 'It didn't seem like fun any more.' </p> <p>There was one excess Napier-Bell didn't get involved in. Despite being all around him, he has rarely taken drugs. He tried amphetamines once in the 1960s and hated them. He has always smoked joints, he says, but they give him a sore throat, so he prefers drinking. 'I like being drunk, falling over, behaving badly. If you ask me what have been the best, funniest experiences of my life, 90 per cent of them would be when I was disgustingly drunk.' </p> <p>He's not anti-drugs. 'They should be legalised as quickly and sensibly as possible.' He talks intelligently about prohibition, arguing that were drugs to be legalised now, the big pharmaceutical giants could dedicate themselves to developing safer, better substances for us to enjoy. 'It's absurd. If you're feeling bad, you're allowed to take a pill to make you feel better, but if you're feeling all right, you're not allowed to. But we all take them anyway. Of some sort or other. Mine come in liquid form.' </p> <p>What is noticeable in his books is that his friends tend to be other managers or musicians he didn't work with. He says this distance was always a conscious choice. 'We always get fired, in the end. Artists are great sponges, they soak things up. They learn it, and eventually they look at the manager and say, \"Why should I pay you 20 per cent\". I don't object to that at all. It's like bringing up a child - you put them through school and then suddenly they're an adult.' </p> <p>Napier-Bell would prefer not to work at all, but if he does it has to be fun. Wham!'s concert in China may have been the last great pop scam. Dreamed up as a way to get the attention of the media, especially in the US, without months of tedious promotion, it was negotiated almost by stealth with the Chinese government, then presented to them as a fait accompli . 'I loved the scams,' Napier-Bell says wistfully. 'You don't do them nowadays. In the 1960s and 1970s we did them every day.' </p> <p>He recalls the PR who shopped his clients, the Walker Brothers, to the police, saying they were bank robbers, the manager who had Goldie the eagle released from London Zoo to promote his act, Goldie &amp; The Gingerbreads, and the riots he provoked on tour with John's Children. Back then, no one really understood how the music business worked. Now, your average teenager knows all about marketing and hype and they'll only enjoy a scam if they're allowed in on the joke. </p> <p>Besides, soon after Wham! played in China, MTV made the video the main means of communication and video directors took over from PRs and managers as kings of the hype. 'It's less fun now,' he admits. 'There's no creative input any more, and you are just a go-between between all the people involved. There isn't any feeling of outrage in the music business and I don't think it will come back, really.' </p> <p>Given his background, I say I'm surprised that he isn't manipulating a boy band right now, but he's shocked at the suggestion. 'You've got to feel some quality in the artists you work with. When I started managing Wham!, a lot of people said, \"How could you do that after Japan?\" But George was a great songwriter and they had a good act. I'd manage a boy band if it was a good laugh and they all had PhDs, but I haven't seen many of those around. </p> <p>'The awful thing now is that they're mainly chosen by the record companies, not by managers, and they deliberately miss out the people with potential star quality. Because stars are always difficult people. I'm amazed Robbie Williams got through, because he's an archetypal star. Record companies take the dullest, most obedient people, the people who do what they're told. Where's the fun in managing that? It's just being a secretary, really.' </p> <p> Black Vinyl, White Powder is published on 5 April by Ebury Press, \u00a316.99.

      "body": "<p>It was on a dark and stormy night two years ago that I began considering the flammability of hardbacks. The pavements outside glittered with black ice and the neighbourhood cats sat with their tails curled round their toes. Inside, I stood close to the oven door, watching myself breathe. The boiler in my flat had shuddered to a halt two days previously and all the plumbers in London were urgently elsewhere. </p> <p>My flat is one of three in a Victorian terrace and is blessed with something rare in London; two open fires. Since the Clean Air Act of 1956, which eliminated the pea-soup smogs, burning fires has retained a hazy legal status. As with most legislation it allows space for creative interpretation. It's all right to burn fires if smokeless fuel is used and it's - erm - sort of all right to burn fires if you have got no other source of heat and are about to lose a couple of limbs to hypothermia. </p> <p>For most of the year the fires remain ornamental. It is possible to buy wood from a couple of distant garages, but it is always overpriced and usually takes a month to dry out. The best supply can usually be scavenged from the builders' skips spiked with scaffolding planks and abandoned kitchen fitments. But this was January and there were no builders. The few logs I had were damp and I had already burnt half a self-assembly shelving unit, three wooden coathangers, a stool, the wooden frame of an old sewing machine, a small chest and a chopping board. It was about the moment I started eyeing up the kitchen table that it occurred to me. Here in the flat I already had an everlasting supply of fuel, an inexhaustible, perpetually replenished multitude of substitute logs. I had books. </p> <p>I had too many books. I had books oozing up the walls and leaking over the floor, I had books in boxes shoved to the back of cupboards, I had books toppling over my desk and pushing their way down the stairs. I had books for work, books for research, books for pleasure, unsolicited books from publishers, review copies, proof copies, limited editions, hardbacks, paperbacks, folio editions, hand-tooled leatherbound Victorian anthologies, encyclopedias, compendiums, sentimental presents and guilty inheritances. I had the books I'd read aged eight and 18 and 28, chocolate-smeared plays from two decades ago and wine-ringed novels from last month. I had books for long-ago articles I'd never look at again, books for self-improvement I hated the sight of and books I thought I ought to read but never would. Occasionally I would sell a bundle of them, but as fast as they went, they got replaced. I had all these books because it was my job to have them, but also because I loved them. Loved them for their content and their context - half my life could be traced back through their buckled covers and broken spines. They represented work, friendship, ambition, possibility and knowledge. They also represented a health hazard. </p> <p>I pulled out a hardback from a pile by the door, a guide to Highland crofting law. It was heavy, substantial, earnest; the sort of book I hoped I would not have to read again. Holding it over the fire I thought, I can't do this. I can't burn a book. I don't want it, but I can't burn it. Books can be sold or given away, but they must not - they should not - be burnt. I put the hardback down, made another cup of coffee and stared a while longer at my own breath. Then I went back downstairs and placed the book on the flames. It burnt sharp and clean, much better than the logs. Watching it, I felt a surreptitious glee, like a child trashing exam notes. After a few hours I developed a technique. A hardback, then a log, turn and turn about. Paperbacks were useless; they left an acrid smell of melting glue and a clump of singed pages at the bottom of the grate. Cheap 1960s hard backs were not much better. Though crisp with age, they burnt too quickly. The best were hardbacks from the Eighties, not too plump, with quality paper and a strong binding. Only the most infuriating books should go, I decided; they must either be badly written or arrogant or dull or all three at once. I got particular joy, I remember, from watching three cookery books, a volume of Welsh medieval history and Sir Walter Scott go up in flames. </p> <p>The next day, I mentioned my new fuel to a friend. 'But you can't,' he said. Why not? 'Because you just can't. You don't burn books. Goebbels,' he said accusingly. 'Stalin.' As he saw it, books, like altars and icons, belong to that dwindling group of sacred objects which cannot be destroyed. Books contain our history, our humanity and our culture. By burning those books, I was falling among low company. The SS burnt books, Stalin burnt books, the Ayatollah Khomeini burnt books. The first act of any repressive regime was to destroy the ideas contained in books. Books are dangerous things, full of dangerous possibilities. Books are inflammatory. </p> <p>Yes, but, I said When Savonarola first lit his Bonfire of Vanities, he wasn't concerning himself with copies of Dealing With Sudden Hair Loss. And he wasn't in serious danger of developing frostbite. When I told a couple more people, I got the same reaction; same unspecified outrage, same implication that I had committed some kind of desecration. No one could quite specify exactly why the idea made them uneasy; it just did. Books is art, innit? You don't fiddle around with art. Art is pure, art is inviolate. Would it, I asked, be the same with paintings? Yes, they said, just the same. But at least paintings are unique; however bad, they are still the only one of their kind. Books, though, are one of 3,000 or 30,000 or 3 million; if you burn a John Grisham novel, there will still be another 2,999,999 copies left. Besides, the aim of most twentieth-century publishing had been to make books cheap, mass-market - and disposable. </p> <p>So what is this taboo? And what about all the other stuff? What does one do with culture once it becomes junk? What about the videos, the CDs, the PlayStation games? We have to find some way to filter, or we will drown. </p> <p>The alternative is either to burn, or to do as Michael Landy has done. For two weeks, you could watch him destroying all his possessions in the name of art. In an empty branch of C&amp;A, the artist stood watching a conveyor belt full of yellow trays while below him someone shredded all that remained of his old life. There were many people watching him. They seemed curious or amused, but they didn't look outraged, not even when a tray rolled past containing the mangled remains of several young British novelists. So how does that work? Does that mean it is all right to destroy art for the sake of art but not all right to destroy art for any other reason? </p> <p>And so, since I'm unlikely to be able to turn myself into an Oxford Street installation, I've gone on burning despite the occasional shivers of alarm. But I do have one final test to apply. My own first book was published a while ago. Like all writers I was sent several author's copies some of which I gave away and some of which I kept. Later, somewhere between proof stage and publication of the American edition, a gremlin crept into the machine. The book is poxed with typos. The British edition is fine, but the US hardback is - well, it's prime material for a bonfire, actually. </p> <p>Can I be as insouciant about smoking out my own words as I have been about other people's? I think so. All I have to do is wait for a dark and stormy night, and the sound of the boiler collapsing.</p>",

I had books oozing up the walls and leaking over the floor, I had books in boxes shoved to the back of cupboards, I had books toppling over my desk and pushing their way down the stairs. I had books for work, books for research, books for pleasure, unsolicited books from publishers, review copies, proof copies, limited editions, hardbacks, paperbacks, folio editions, hand-tooled leatherbound Victorian anthologies, encyclopedias, compendiums, sentimental presents and guilty inheritances. I had the books I'd read aged eight and 18 and 28, chocolate-smeared plays from two decades ago and wine-ringed novels from last month. I had books for long-ago articles I'd never look at again, books for self-improvement I hated the sight of and books I thought I ought to read but never would. Occasionally I would sell a bundle of them, but as fast as they went, they got replaced. I had all these books because it was my job to have them, but also because I loved them. Loved them for their content and their context - half my life could be traced back through their buckled covers and broken spines. They represented work, friendship, ambition, possibility and knowledge. They also represented a health hazard. I pulled out a hardback from a pile by the door, a guide to Highland crofting law. It was heavy, substantial, earnest; the sort of book I hoped I would not have to read again. Holding it over the fire I thought, I can't do this. I can't burn a book. I don't want it, but I can't burn it. Books can be sold or given away, but they must not - they should not - be burnt. I put the hardback down, made another cup of coffee and stared a while longer at my own breath. Then I went back downstairs and placed the book on the flames. It burnt sharp and clean, much better than the logs. Watching it, I felt a surreptitious glee, like a child trashing exam notes. After a few hours I developed a technique. A hardback, then a log, turn and turn about. Paperbacks were useless; they left an acrid smell of melting glue and a clump of singed pages at the bottom of the grate. Cheap 1960s hard backs were not much better. Though crisp with age, they burnt too quickly. The best were hardbacks from the Eighties, not too plump, with quality paper and a strong binding. Only the most infuriating books should go, I decided; they must either be badly written or arrogant or dull or all three at once. I got particular joy, I remember, from watching three cookery books, a volume of Welsh medieval history and Sir Walter Scott go up in flames. The next day, I mentioned my new fuel to a friend. 'But you can't,' he said. Why not? 'Because you just can't. You don't burn books. Goebbels,' he said accusingly. 'Stalin.' As he saw it, books, like altars and icons, belong to that dwindling group of sacred objects which cannot be destroyed. Books contain our history, our humanity and our culture. By burning those books, I was falling among low company. The SS burnt books, Stalin burnt books, the Ayatollah Khomeini burnt books. The first act of any repressive regime was to destroy the ideas contained in books. Books are dangerous things, full of dangerous possibilities. Books are inflammatory. Yes, but, I said When Savonarola first lit his Bonfire of Vanities, he wasn't concerning himself with copies of Dealing With Sudden Hair Loss. And he wasn't in serious danger of developing frostbite. When I told a couple more people, I got the same reaction; same unspecified outrage, same implication that I had committed some kind of desecration. No one could quite specify exactly why the idea made them uneasy; it just did. Books is art, innit? You don't fiddle around with art. Art is pure, art is inviolate. Would it, I asked, be the same with paintings? Yes, they said, just the same. But at least paintings are unique; however bad, they are still the only one of their kind. Books, though, are one of 3,000 or 30,000 or 3 million; if you burn a John Grisham novel, there will still be another 2,999,999 copies left. Besides, the aim of most twentieth-century publishing had been to make books cheap, mass-market - and disposable. So what is this taboo? And what about all the other stuff? What does one do with culture once it becomes junk? What about the videos, the CDs, the PlayStation games? We have to find some way to filter, or we will drown. The alternative is either to burn, or to do as Michael Landy has done. For two weeks, you could watch him destroying all his possessions in the name of art. In an empty branch of C&amp;A, the artist stood watching a conveyor belt full of yellow trays while below him someone shredded all that remained of his old life. There were many people watching him. They seemed curious or amused, but they didn't look outraged, not even when a tray rolled past containing the mangled remains of several young British novelists. So how does that work? Does that mean it is all right to destroy art for the sake of art but not all right to destroy art for any other reason? And so, since I'm unlikely to be able to turn myself into an Oxford Street installation, I've gone on burning despite the occasional shivers of alarm. But I do have one final test to apply. My own first book was published a while ago. Like all writers I was sent several author's copies some of which I gave away and some of which I kept. Later, somewhere between proof stage and publication of the American edition, a gremlin crept into the machine. The book is poxed with typos. The British edition is fine, but the US hardback is - well, it's prime material for a bonfire, actually. Can I be as insouciant about smoking out my own words as I have been about other people's? I think so. All I have to do is wait for a dark and stormy night, and the sound of the boiler collapsing.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer:</strong> What do you think The Falls is about? </p> <p><strong> Ian Rankin: </strong> It began with a piece of serendipity. A French TV crew wanted to interview me about the new Scottish Parliament. I suggested that we do the interview at the new Museum of Scotland on Chamber Street. As we walked in the door, a member of staff said: 'You should do something about the Arthur's Seat coffins.' So I went up to the fourth floor and here were these little six-inch high wooden coffins with tiny dolls inside, found in a cave on Arthur's Seat by some kids in 1836. I'm attracted to real-life mysteries with no ending. That got me thinking, What if Rebus got involved in an investigation of this hidden Edinburgh I've always tried to write about? </p> <p>I came to Edinburgh as an outsider. I was from a small mining town 30 miles north and it seemed to me a very strange place, a city that liked to hide itself away. It presented this facade of history, as if you weren't allowed to look at Edinburgh in the present day. At that time nobody was writing Trainspotting - style books about Edinburgh. In the Eighties, when I was first trying to write, the modern Edinburgh novel was The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie which had been published in 1961 and was set in the 1930s. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Muriel Spark was one of your subjects, wasn't she? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> She was my PhD at Edinburgh University. Instead of finishing the PhD I wrote three novels. The first one was never published. Eventually I just stuck it in the bottom drawer, where it lingers to this day. My wife still says it's my best book. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Did you always want to be a writer? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> I've always written. At the age of six or seven I would get sheets of A4 paper and fold them in half, cut the edges to make a little eight-page booklet, break it up into squares and put in little stick men with little speech bubbles, and I'd have a spy story, a space story and a football story. I would show it to my mum. I was just an obsessive kid and I wasn't happy. I think part of it was growing up in what had been a mining community in Cardenden, a village of about 7,000 people in Fife. By the 1960s the coal had run out; the town was beginning to go downhill. We tried to make Cardenden a more exciting place than it really was. So we pretended the town was surrounded by aliens. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What books were you reading? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> We didn't have many books in the house. I was allowed lots of comics and eventually, around the age of 12 or 13, there was this astonishing realisation that I couldn't see X-certificate films but I could go to the library and get One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Godfather, A Clockwork Orange. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> At what age did you come across Robert Louis Stevenson? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> Kidnapped and Treasure Island when I was 10 or 11. Jekyll and Hyde I read in high school. I was expecting a Hollywood-type horror story and couldn't believe it when I got this very complex narrative from all these different points of view. Later, I just happened to be at university at the time when the Scottish novel was getting big again. Alasdair Gray came on the scene, and James Kelman. William McIlvanney had already been there. He was a huge influence because he was a serious writer who'd won the Whitbread Prize. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Did you want to write the great Scottish novel? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> Not at that time. After the comic books I got into pop music. I made a band up in my head. I wrote all the lyrics, I took them on tour. I had the Top 10 every week, with nine other fictional groups. The band was called the Amoebas and I was doing these really bad two-minute pop tunes with lyrics like 'Hello, hello, hello, hello, how are you doing today?/ Are you doing OK, are you feeling all right?/ Baby out of sight.' </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> There's a lot of music in The Falls. </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> I would have loved to have been a rock 'n' roll star. But none of us was musical and none of us had any instruments. If I'd become a rock musician in real life I couldn't have had the fantasy. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> How did you get from music to literature? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> It was an accident. At school when I was 16 or 17, a poetry competition came up run by the Scots Language Society and I thought, well I write poetry, I write the lyrics for the Amoebas. So I wrote a new poem called 'Euthanasia' which won second prize and I got five quid. That was the start. By the time I arrived at university, the poem had been published in a magazine, so I joined the Poetry Society. The poems I was writing were narratives: so and so went here, and did this, and this was the consequence. It wasn't emotion recollected in tranquillity. I wrote my first short story for a competition and won second prize. Another competition came up and I won first prize. The first story was published in a newspaper. The second went out on radio. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> The reader is very aware of the Scots language in your work. Is that self-conscious? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> Right from the very beginning I knew I wanted to write palpably Scottish fiction. I took the first James Kelman novel, The Bus Conductor Hines, home to my dad. I thought, my dad will like this; it's written in Scots. But my dad said: 'I can't read that.' He was reading James Bond and John le Carr\u00e9. That was part of what attracted me to crime - the idea of getting a wide audience. Everything I wanted to say about Scotland I could say in a crime novel. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Are you a novelist who happens to write crime fiction, or a crime writer who's been acclaimed by the literary press? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> Ah, that's a tough one. I don't think it matters, really. In the early days it did annoy me. I wrote Knots and Crosses, the first of the Rebus books, not even realising that I was writing crime fiction. The Falls is dedicated to Allan Massie. He once said: 'Who would be James Joyce if they could be John Buchan?' And in Scotland there was no tradition of the crime novel. The English crime novel was perceived as being an entertainment, a puzzle. In Scotland, the tradition I was coming from was much more the Gothic novel. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> I lost count of the number of references to Jekyll and Hyde in The Falls. </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> One of the theories behind the Arthur's Seat coffins is that they represent the victims of Burke and Hare. It brings you back to that period in Scottish history that Stevenson wrote about in The Body Snatchers. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> In The Falls Edinburgh has almost become a character. </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> It's a major character because it has influenced Rebus. The real mystery in these books isn't the crime. OK, it's a crime novel, with a crime, an investigation and a resolution, so it's got the structure of the crime novel. But underneath, the real mystery is Rebus coming to terms with Edinburgh. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Is he you? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> At the start, no. As I've got older, either he's become more like me or I've become like him. I think I've grown into his skin because now I spend about 10 months of the year inside his head. In the first book he was a cipher, a way of telling a story. It was going to be a one-off, and I nearly killed him off at the end of the first book. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Do you ever feel like Arthur Conan Doyle wanting to kill off Holmes? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> Well Rebus lives in real time. He was 40 in the book and he's now in his early fifties. He'll retire at 60. I think by then I may even have grown out of him, or he may have grown tired with me. I haven't planned a series, like J.K. Rowling. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What do you think the purpose of fiction is? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> For me it's therapy. Anything that's going wrong in my life, anything like that, I just give to Rebus as a plot. So I'm working through my worries through him. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> You took a long while to sell. </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> The longest apprenticeship in literature. The first book came out in 1986 and from then, one or two books a year were published, but I wasn't making money I could live on until Black and Blue. It's in the last two or three years that things have really taken off, because the back list suddenly clicked. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Now your books dominate the best-seller list in Scotland. </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> I got a little citation from the Guinness Book of Records which was very nice. Every month, say, each title sells 5,000 copies. I've got 12 Rebus titles; that's 60,000 books a month selling on the back list. Multiply that by 12 months and then add in a new book every year - that's a million sales in the UK. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Are you proud of that? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> I think it's astonishing that so many people would want to read about a dour Presbyterian Edinburgh cop. Crime fiction is going through a second golden age. It seems to me, looking at the Whitbread short list or the Booker, that the literary novel is actually looking back. The crime novel is dealing with illegal immigrants, paedophiles, drugs, and it's dealing with the big moral questions of good and evil. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> And what would you do if you weren't writing? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin: </strong> I'm not qualified for anything. I've had lots of little jobs, like picking grapes and being a tax man. I can't imagine not writing because I've done it since I was five or six. Maybe I'd work in academia. That's always what the plan was. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> What are you working on now? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> I should be writing the next Rebus, which is probably gonna be called The Resurrection Men. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> How much do you owe to the so-called Scottish literary renaissance? </p> <p> <strong> Rankin:</strong> Nothing was happening in Edinburgh when I was trying to be a writer. Then I moved to London, and France. While I was in France, Trainspotting came along. Now we've got J.K. Rowling, Kate Atkinson, Dorothy Dunnett, Irvine Welsh, Iain Banks, me and half a dozen other crime writers who have all written about Edinburgh. I wish we all got together and chatted in pubs but we don't. Iain Banks and I get together occasionally with a bunch of poets for long whisky-tasting sessions, but we end up talking about Carry On films. </p> <p>\u0095 Ian Rankin is Scotland's bestselling crime writer. The first volumes in his Rebus series have recently been adapted for TV, starring John Hannah</p> <p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/reviews/crime/0,6121,458333,00.html\">Peter Guttridge reviews The Falls</a></p>",

Rankin: I'm not qualified for anything. I've had lots of little jobs, like picking grapes and being a tax man. I can't imagine not writing because I've done it since I was five or six. Maybe I'd work in academia. That's always what the plan was. Obs: What are you working on now? Rankin: I should be writing the next Rebus, which is probably gonna be called The Resurrection Men. Obs: How much do you owe to the so-called Scottish literary renaissance? Rankin: Nothing was happening in Edinburgh when I was trying to be a writer. Then I moved to London, and France. While I was in France, Trainspotting came along. Now we've got J.K. Rowling, Kate Atkinson, Dorothy Dunnett, Irvine Welsh, Iain Banks, me and half a dozen other crime writers who have all written about Edinburgh. I wish we all got together and chatted in pubs but we don't. Iain Banks and I get together occasionally with a bunch of poets for long whisky-tasting sessions, but we end up talking about Carry On films. \u0095 Ian Rankin is Scotland's bestselling crime writer. The first volumes in his Rebus series have recently been adapted for TV, starring John Hannah Peter Guttridge reviews The Falls",

During his endlessly shape-shifting 30-year career, the trumpeter reinvented jazz again and again in an unstoppable series of genre-defining releases. Taken individually, they cater to nearly every conceivable musical taste. Hard bop aficionados rave about recordings from the early 1950s like Steamin' or Workin'. Classically minded listeners celebrate his collaborations with the arranger Gil Evans - such as Miles Ahead or the flamenco-flavoured Sketches of Spain. More adventurous souls flock to the sonic maelstrom of Bitches Brew or the mutant funk of On the Corner. </p> <p>The one record that has enjoyed a truly universal appeal, though, is Kind of Blue. Perhaps it is the effortless restraint of the playing, or the sublime sense of mood. Perhaps it is just the album's reputation as the ultimate seduction record. But somehow, four decades after its release, its popularity seems, if anything, to be steadily growing. It has taken on a life of its own - becoming a businessman's dream in the process. As one awestruck record company executive remarks in this book, Kind of Blue still routinely shifts 5,000 copies every week, without any real promotion at all. And the figures continue to climb steadily. </p> <p>The bare facts behind Kind of Blue's genesis are even more extraordinary. On 2 March 1959, at 2.30pm, seven musicians went into Columbia's studio on East 30th Street in New York and emerged after six hours with what would become the first side of the record. They returned a few weeks later for another three hours and polished off the second. What really happened in that room to produce such instant magic? That's the mystery that Ashley Kahn tries to unravel here, exploring the making of the record in those two short sessions. </p> <p>As pianist Bill Evans's now-famous sleeve-notes tell it, the Kind of Blue sessions represent a perfect embodiment of the spontaneous, freewheeling spirit of jazz. Although the musicians - Davis, Evans, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb, and Wynton Kelly - had plenty of experience of playing together, the material they worked on for Kind of Blue was entirely new in form and content. Davis himself wrote out sketches of the tunes only hours before the sessions. The rest, it seems, was pure group improvisation, following Davis's usual no-nonsense studio procedures: one perfect take for each tune. </p> <p>Drawing on evidence from photographs of the sessions, and by listening to the original master tapes, Kahn manages partially to resurrect the atmosphere of the recording on those two fateful days. But in terms of getting closer to how the music really came about, he inevitably comes unstuck. The tapes merely reinforce the mythical magic of Kind of Blue 's immaculate conception. The studio banter they preserve is extremely limited, revealing only a few typically minimal comments from Davis to the other members of the group and a few jokes. </p> <p>There's precious little surplus musical material, either. At the start of the first session, the producer calls out: 'The machine's on... here we go: CO 62290, no title, take one.' After three false starts, the group finish the complete take that ends up on the album. The other tracks seem to have been created equally fluently, tainted only by the slightest of improvisational hiccups. As drummer Jimmy Cobb - the only member of the group who is still alive - memorably once put it: 'We just went ahead and did it'. </p> <p>More fruitful, however, is Kahn's in-depth analysis of Davis's career in the years leading up to the sessions. He traces his evolution from the early days with Charlie Parker in 1945 (when he was famously described as a player who 'couldn't blow his nose'), to the assured, economical phrasings of Kind of Blue. </p> <p>He shows how he redirected jazz away from the feverish sound of bebop, towards a much more pared, lyrical sound and influenced scores of later players. It is a wonderfully clear, fascinating insight into the trumpeter's chameleon-like creative processes. </p> <p>As for Davis himself, it seems that he merely saw Kind of Blue as a beautiful failure. In his autobiography, he relates how the initial inspiration for the record was rooted in a childhood memory of walking home from church, his head filled with gospel music.

Writer, visionary, prophet, composer, artist, herbalist, politician, preacher, property owner, upbraider of emperors and favourite of Popes, she could even exorcise demons and heal the sick. She invented her own language, wrote one of the earliest surviving morality plays, established her own convent, terrorised her detractors, and, when she died, was mourned by nuns and reverently biographised by monks. </p> <p>Born in 1098 in the Rhineland, Hildegard's unusual abilities were visible from an early age, when she startled her nurse by predicting the colouring of an unborn calf. At eight, she was given by her parents as a tithe to the Church. In middle age a visitation urged Hildegard to write down her visions. She produced a vast corpus: allegories, prophecies, cosmologies, a medical encyclopedia, a guide to herbal cures, an elaborate sequence of chants and hundreds of letters. </p> <p>Her writings are strewn with apocalyptic images - the stars, the serpent, the jaws of hell. Her medical suggestions are enticingly chaotic: advice not to eat carnivorous animals seems practical; suggested treatment for epilepsy (a small cake made from the blood of a mole, duck beak, the feet of a female goose and wheat flour) would surely cure only a hypochondriac. </p> <p>Accounts of her life generally start with her Vita, written by monks before and after her death.

      "bodyText": "Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age Fiona Maddocks Headline \u00a315.99, pp332 Buy it at a discount at BOL The 12th century anchorite Hildegard of Bingen possessed a clutch of talents which would make even the most eclectic of media-donnas curdle with envy. Writer, visionary, prophet, composer, artist, herbalist, politician, preacher, property owner, upbraider of emperors and favourite of Popes, she could even exorcise demons and heal the sick. She invented her own language, wrote one of the earliest surviving morality plays, established her own convent, terrorised her detractors, and, when she died, was mourned by nuns and reverently biographised by monks. Born in 1098 in the Rhineland, Hildegard's unusual abilities were visible from an early age, when she startled her nurse by predicting the colouring of an unborn calf. At eight, she was given by her parents as a tithe to the Church. In middle age a visitation urged Hildegard to write down her visions. She produced a vast corpus: allegories, prophecies, cosmologies, a medical encyclopedia, a guide to herbal cures, an elaborate sequence of chants and hundreds of letters. Her writings are strewn with apocalyptic images - the stars, the serpent, the jaws of hell. Her medical suggestions are enticingly chaotic: advice not to eat carnivorous animals seems practical; suggested treatment for epilepsy (a small cake made from the blood of a mole, duck beak, the feet of a female goose and wheat flour) would surely cure only a hypochondriac. Accounts of her life generally start with her Vita, written by monks before and after her death. There are also almost 400 letters in Latin, and her own accounts of visions and visitations. She was written to by monk and nun acolytes, eager for spiritual advice. As a firm supporter of the religious and social status quo, she was occasionally attacked for the rigid separation of social ranks in her order, which she defended with a hardly diplomatic analogy: 'And who would gather all his livestock indiscriminately into one barn - the cattle, the asses, the sheep, the kids?'

As in the books of some of the more excitable horror writers, where new characters appear on one page in order to meet violent ends on the next, there is a kind of juvenile fascination in the introduction of each new woman, black and white, mullata and mestizo, and a swift calculation as to how long it will take before each is fabulously and repetitively satisfied by Pedro's priapic charms. </p> <p>A few of these encounters have a dark humour: that with a poetess whose ardour - 'I swoon in the voracious cataclysm of the impossible' - he cannot quite take; or with a 'confused woman' who uses 'insane' phrases like 'making love' and 'we could be happy'. Mostly, though, the joke seems forced or inadvertent (witness the man who masturbates to the smell of his own armpits). This sense is not helped by a translation which, despite its command of pejorative, labours to find a convincing vernacular for some of Pedro Juan's semi-comic posturing. </p> <p>His defence of his life and his methods is the Sadeian one that 'only an angry, obscene, violent, offensive art can show us the other side of the world, the side we never see or try not to see so as to avoid troubling our consciences'. </p> <p>The book is at its best, however, not in its anger but in its occasional portrayal of the desperate detail of street life: the Russian roulette, for example, played by young boys on bikes, who, for 20 pesos, attempt to make it across eight-lane highways just as the lights turn green. </p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez can make the fabric of the city come alive in these passages; the ramshackle rooming houses become characters in their own right; the elevator in Pedro Juan's apartment building is, thus, like a 'senile old man, it moves down very slowly, shivering and snorting, as if it no longer had the strength for so much work'. When this book was published in America, Guti\u00e9rrez was compared, perhaps for intent as much as execution, to other like-minded liberators such as Henry Miller and Charles Bukowski.

While the show was on, bookshops in London quickly sold out of Encyclopaedia Anatomica, a door-stopping photography book, published by Taschen, which catalogued the entire Specola collection. What might once have been imagined as a gory sideshow became a popular paperback, and the curiosities of the eighteenth century found a new audience in the twenty first. </p> <p>Now Taschen has embarked on a new venture: it is publishing a series of small, neat softbacks called Icons. Icons are like tasters - affordable versions of Taschen's larger books, more smart collectables than hefty art tomes. </p> <p>The pocket-sized Encyclopaedia Anatomica, with its sinewy sculptures and its model of a pregnant woman whose middle can be taken apart in layers, is one of the first. It is published alongside Gilles Neret's book on nineteenth-century erotica (the lesser-known sketches of Toulouse-Lautrec, the lewder Degas, the early Ingres - as well as some hardcore anonymous Victorians). There is a book of Karl Blossfeldt's photographic collages, another of Piranesi drawings and a collection of Edward S. Curtis's portraits of native Americans. </p> <p>One about pin-ups charts the 1940s' publications of American impresario Robert Harrison. Wink, Flirt and Eyeful all had garish, stylised covers featuring cartoon-like girls in fishnet stockings and push-up bras. Unlike the photo-stories inside, the covers were hailed as a kind of popular art almost immediately. But by the 1950s, the coy looks that brightened up the war had been superseded by girls baring all. </p> <p>Porn took over from pin-ups and Harrison, seeing that no holds were barred, founded a magazine that made him infamous: Confidential, the scandal-sheet to the stars. Harrison brought icons down, but with his images, Taschen's Icons series has only just begun.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Taschen Icons: Encyclopedia Anatomica and others Taschen \u00a34.99, pp191 The Hayward Gallery's recent exhibition, Spectacular Bodies, was not for the squeamish, but many observers were fascinated by some of the famous anatomical wax models permanently housed in the Specola museum in Florence. While the show was on, bookshops in London quickly sold out of Encyclopaedia Anatomica, a door-stopping photography book, published by Taschen, which catalogued the entire Specola collection. What might once have been imagined as a gory sideshow became a popular paperback, and the curiosities of the eighteenth century found a new audience in the twenty first. Now Taschen has embarked on a new venture: it is publishing a series of small, neat softbacks called Icons. Icons are like tasters - affordable versions of Taschen's larger books, more smart collectables than hefty art tomes. The pocket-sized Encyclopaedia Anatomica, with its sinewy sculptures and its model of a pregnant woman whose middle can be taken apart in layers, is one of the first. It is published alongside Gilles Neret's book on nineteenth-century erotica (the lesser-known sketches of Toulouse-Lautrec, the lewder Degas, the early Ingres - as well as some hardcore anonymous Victorians). There is a book of Karl Blossfeldt's photographic collages, another of Piranesi drawings and a collection of Edward S. Curtis's portraits of native Americans. One about pin-ups charts the 1940s' publications of American impresario Robert Harrison. Wink, Flirt and Eyeful all had garish, stylised covers featuring cartoon-like girls in fishnet stockings and push-up bras. Unlike the photo-stories inside, the covers were hailed as a kind of popular art almost immediately. But by the 1950s, the coy looks that brightened up the war had been superseded by girls baring all. Porn took over from pin-ups and Harrison, seeing that no holds were barred, founded a magazine that made him infamous: Confidential, the scandal-sheet to the stars. Harrison brought icons down, but with his images, Taschen's Icons series has only just begun.",

      "body": "<p>David Handley was sitting at home yesterday in his tidy, pink house in the rolling Monmouthshire hills, watching grey skies that promised rain. Outside his pedigree herd of Jersey cows grazed in the fields of the Old Llanishen farm.</p> <p>It seems an unlikely place to be plotting a war, but, mobile phone in hand, that is what Handley is doing. The 49-year-old dairy farmer, head of the militant group Farmers for Action, has issued an ultimatum to the Government. Either the mass cull ordered last week to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease is halted - or the Government will face a rural revolt. Handley isn't messing around.</p> <p>'I hope they see common sense. The Government in London just does not understand what they are doing. It is madness. This is a senseless slaughter. Either they stop it or we stop them.'</p> <p>Handley has been here before. At the head of last November's fuel protests he set a 60-day deadline for a cut in petrol prices. That ultimatum failed. He does not intend to let that happen again. Using the networks of friendships and phones created during the fuel crisis, the FFA activists plan to block slaughtermen heading for the farms. They will stop them at the farm gate, Handley says. They will not back down. If necessary they will go to jail for their cause.</p> <p>Once more the countryside is in revolt. The battle lines are drawn. From Dumfriesshire to Devon, farmers stand guard over their cherished flocks and herds. Some talk of violence others of more passive resistance. Some, as an Observer investigation has discovered, have opted for civil disobedience. In a dangerous move that threatens to jeopardise the containment efforts their colleagues are so angry about, they are deliberately flouting the restrictions on movement that the Government has imposed since the disease was first discovered last month.</p> <p>Yesterday nine new cases were discovered, bringing the total to 282. The situation is now so serious that Ministry of Agriculture officials have begun to discuss the use of police to get their staff on to farms to complete the cull. The Army is standing by. MI5, the domestic intelligence service, and the Special Branch have sent the Home Office preliminary assessments of the situation and its implications for national security.</p> <p>Both agencies have been monitoring the crisis, and key characters, in recent days. Now, faced by old foes like Handley and Andrew Spence, last seen leading a convoy of trucks from the North East to London in the final days of the autumn's fuel protest, old files have been dusted off.</p> <p>The fuel protests took 10 days to bring under control, not least because the men who led them had the sympathy of much of the country. The Government lost 20 points in the polls in a single week. Five months later, people like Handley cannot be dismissed as isolated firebrands in love with their own rhetoric. They have undoubted support. 'We are desperate men,' said one Cornwall farmer yesterday. 'There is death all around us. Our lives are literally going up in smoke and we are not in control of events. We've got to try and make a stand and claw back some power over our own lives.'</p> <p>The contrast with just seven days ago is massive. Last weekend the focus was on the disease and its causes and cures, and on the threat it posed to rural life. This weekend the focus has turned inwards. And it's turned nasty.</p> <p>As the skies of rural Britain thicken with black smoke from the pyres of tens of thousands of animals, as a bewildered nation remains isolated - physically, psychologically, diplomatically and medically - from the rest of the world, as economists predict a \u00a39 billion bill, as the likelihood grows of an embarrassing postponement of May elections, the Government has its back to the wall.</p> <p>Tomorrow Jim Scudamore, the Government's chief veterinary officer, will travel to Cumbria to tell angry farmers why he advised Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, to order the cull. They will take some persuading. The cull involves the slaughter of up to a million animals, most of them quite healthy. All animals within three kilometres (1.75 miles) of infected farms in the two 'hot' areas of Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway are to die in a bid to create 'firebreaks' to hold back the disease. It's a radical solution for an extraordinary situation. But though the National Farmers' Union has reluctantly backed the plan, many of its members are incensed. Even the RSPCA joined the clamour of voices raised against it. And increasingly, Ministers are the target for the countryside's anger. 'They don't understand the countryside and they have just massively over-reacted in the way they have handled the disease,' said Russell Butler, a 25-year-old Berkshire farmer.</p> <p>The Government never wanted this. From the very outset it has been playing down talk of emergency and playing up words of consensus and cooperation. In the offices of the Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) and in Downing Street it was agreed, whatever happened, that the Government must not become the target of the protest. That policy is now coming apart at the seams.</p> <p>The Government is between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, pictures in the press of police forcing their way on to farms will add to the sense of national crisis and further damage the country's tattered image overseas. But to allow the farmers of Cumbria the upper hand would mean Maff's 'contain and destroy' policy on foot and mouth had failed. The Government cannot allow that to happen. Today the big worry is that Scudamore will fail to win over the Cumbrian farmers and the Government will have to move into 'enforcement mode'.</p> <p>With troops on the streets and police at the farm gate it will be far harder for Tony Blair to push through an election on 3 May. That timetable has been in place for three years. With Labour miles ahead in the polls, any delay is a gamble. The stakes over the next 48 hours are very high.</p> <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown and Environment Minister Michael Meacher will announce a multi-million pound rescue package on Tuesday. There will be cash for farmers and, it is thought, soft loans for the battered rural tourism and leisure industry. It may head off the growing anger of Britain's rural communities, never Labour's natural constituency. Then again, it may not.</p> <p>But while the farmers rage about a distant and disorganised government, an Observer investigation has revealed that one of the main catalysts for the ferocious spread of the disease - among the most infectious known to man - may have been illegal movements of livestock by the farmers themselves. In the two weeks after the first case of foot and mouth was discovered in a sow at an Essex abattoir on 19 February, hundreds of farmers throughout the country ignored restrictions imposed to control the outbreak. The movements, usually carried out under darkness, are still continuing according to local government authorities charged with stopping them and prosecuting wrongdoers. In the worst cases farmers are being investigated for trying to deliberately infect their animals and claim compensation.</p> <p>Local council trading standards officers at 15 of the 28 councils with infected farms in their territory told The Observer that they are preparing to prosecute a total of 24 farmers. They stressed that they have only been able to apprehend a tiny fraction of the lawbreakers.</p> <p>'We know that across the country there have been hundreds of individual movements of sheep, pigs and cattle, either on the same farm or between separate properties,' one trading standards source said. 'But it is very hard to get enough evidence to go to court.'</p> <p>Nationwide, scores of prosecutions are expected.</p> <p>Maff has ordered that no sheep should be moved within 10kms (6.5 miles) of an infected farm. That means hundreds of thousands of sheep left out in the cold, without fodder, in the run-up to lambing. The temptation to move the livestock to safety can prove too great to resist.</p> <p>Ken Yorston, trading standards manager in Montgomeryshire, branded farmers who broke the law 'grossly irresponsible'. He stressed that it was a single smuggled sheep from Cumbria to a farm in South Armagh that brought the virus over the Irish Sea and into Northern Ireland. Though just one animal had the disease, the discovery of foot and mouth prompted panic and the slaughter of 1,000 pigs, 400 cattle and 250 sheep.</p> <p>Last week Norman Dalgarno, a 49-year-old sheep farmer from Tregony in Cornwall, was fined \u00a33,500 after caught moving eight sheep from one field to another several miles away. He later admitted he had moved around 50 animals. The prosecutions represent the 'tip of the iceberg', say trading standards officers. In Devon, Cumbria and Powys nearly 200 individual movements of animals that breached the restrictions have been reported. The true amount of illegal transporting is far larger. 'In the countryside people stick together, so when they do call in it is because they have seen something that they are genuinely very angry with,' said Phil Ashcroft, a trading standards official with Cumbria County Council.</p> <p>Cumbrian trading standards are hoping to prosecute two farmers next week who they believe moved healthy sheep to fields adjacent to a farm infected with the virus in order to infect them and claim compensation payments - currently farmers are paid a good rate for slaughtered animals in a very slack market. 'They will be interviewed next week and if we get enough evidence we will prosecute them,' a Cumbrian investigator said.</p> <p>Officials in Staffordshire suspect a farmer of deliberately not taking anti-foot and mouth precautions because he planned to leave farming and wanted to claim compensation before he sold up. The farmer's animals, however, are still uninfected. His property is now being observed by trading standards officers.</p> <p>There is also concern that farmers are still feeding unprocessed swill to pigs, despite suspicions that this caused the initial disease outbreak at a farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumbria. Swill, usually a mix of leftovers from schools, canteens and restaurants, has to be heat-treated to kill viruses before it is fed to pigs. Last week three pig keepers - two with business links to the Heddon farm - admitted keeping improperly treated swill on their premises. Two were fined.</p> <p>The truth is that no one knows where the disease comes from. And no one knows how much the out break is going to cost. Last week the respected Centre for Economic and Business Research estimated a \u00a39bn bill. Economists are divided over its impact. Some were confident that Britain's strong economy would be unaffected. Others felt the country could be forced into a recession.</p> <p>Worst hit, says the CEBR, will be the travel industry. 'The image of Britain now is of beef burning not beefeaters. That's hardly attractive to holidaymakers,' said Paul Crawford, a CEBR analyst. The loss to the economy will be mitigated by the diversion of money not spent on rural tourism.</p> <p>However \u00a39bn is more than one per cent of the country's gross domestic product for the year, and the tax receipts lost by the Treasury will be three times greater than the tax cuts made by the Chancellor in the Budget. Some economists have talked of a 'confluence of negative factors' that could spark serious problems for everyone.</p> <p>But in the fields, cottages and barns, the hurt is more personal. Yesterday 78-year-old Robert Brough walked to the gates of his 200-acre Cumbrian farm, bolted them and carefully arranged a 'Keep Out' sign. On the hills around him smoke plumes rose from the pits where his neighbour's cherished flocks were burning.</p> <p>'I know it won't stop the disease - but it might hold up the Maff vets for a bit,' he says, with a weak smile.</p> <p>'This farm is my life. Now it is going to be reduced to nothing. It has become a killing field.'</p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by John Arlidge in Scotland, Ed Helmore in New York and Kate Connolly in Berlin</p> <p><b>Step by step to meltdown</b></p> <p>In only a month, Britain has gone from the first sighting of the disease to turmoil throughout the country:</p> <p>\u0095 Outbreak discovered on 10 February at an Essex abattoir and traced to a pig farm in Northumbria. Two days later a quarantine ban is imposed on two farms that had supplied livestock for slaughter. Too late.</p> <p>\u0095 Now more than 160,000 animals have been destroyed with hundreds of thousands more to come. There are 282 confirmed cases of the disease with nine new ones reported yesterday. One of the fresh cases is in the previously disease-free county of Shropshire.</p> <p>\u0095 The National Farmers Union estimates foot and mouth is costing agriculture \u00a364 million pounds a week. The total cost to Britain is expected to run into billions. Culture Secretary Chris Smith is considering aid to the tourist industry which fears a 'lost summer' if the crisis continues.</p> <p>\u0095 Timing of a general election expected to be called for 3 May is under threat. Thousands of other events across Britain have already been cancelled, from hunts to horse racing meetings to St. Patrick's Day parades.</p> <p>\u0095 The Government vows to press ahead with mass cull of up to one million animals to create 'firebreaks' around infected areas, mainly in Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway, to halt virus's spread.</p> <p>\u0095 Militant farmers groups promise a 'rural revolt' to prevent the slaughter of healthy animals. They accuse the Government of sacrificing their flocks for political ends.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

The situation is now so serious that Ministry of Agriculture officials have begun to discuss the use of police to get their staff on to farms to complete the cull. The Army is standing by. MI5, the domestic intelligence service, and the Special Branch have sent the Home Office preliminary assessments of the situation and its implications for national security. Both agencies have been monitoring the crisis, and key characters, in recent days. Now, faced by old foes like Handley and Andrew Spence, last seen leading a convoy of trucks from the North East to London in the final days of the autumn's fuel protest, old files have been dusted off. The fuel protests took 10 days to bring under control, not least because the men who led them had the sympathy of much of the country. The Government lost 20 points in the polls in a single week. Five months later, people like Handley cannot be dismissed as isolated firebrands in love with their own rhetoric. They have undoubted support. 'We are desperate men,' said one Cornwall farmer yesterday. 'There is death all around us. Our lives are literally going up in smoke and we are not in control of events. We've got to try and make a stand and claw back some power over our own lives.' The contrast with just seven days ago is massive. Last weekend the focus was on the disease and its causes and cures, and on the threat it posed to rural life. This weekend the focus has turned inwards. And it's turned nasty. As the skies of rural Britain thicken with black smoke from the pyres of tens of thousands of animals, as a bewildered nation remains isolated - physically, psychologically, diplomatically and medically - from the rest of the world, as economists predict a \u00a39 billion bill, as the likelihood grows of an embarrassing postponement of May elections, the Government has its back to the wall. Tomorrow Jim Scudamore, the Government's chief veterinary officer, will travel to Cumbria to tell angry farmers why he advised Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, to order the cull. They will take some persuading. The cull involves the slaughter of up to a million animals, most of them quite healthy. All animals within three kilometres (1.75 miles) of infected farms in the two 'hot' areas of Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway are to die in a bid to create 'firebreaks' to hold back the disease. It's a radical solution for an extraordinary situation. But though the National Farmers' Union has reluctantly backed the plan, many of its members are incensed. Even the RSPCA joined the clamour of voices raised against it. And increasingly, Ministers are the target for the countryside's anger. 'They don't understand the countryside and they have just massively over-reacted in the way they have handled the disease,' said Russell Butler, a 25-year-old Berkshire farmer. The Government never wanted this. From the very outset it has been playing down talk of emergency and playing up words of consensus and cooperation. In the offices of the Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) and in Downing Street it was agreed, whatever happened, that the Government must not become the target of the protest. That policy is now coming apart at the seams. The Government is between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, pictures in the press of police forcing their way on to farms will add to the sense of national crisis and further damage the country's tattered image overseas. But to allow the farmers of Cumbria the upper hand would mean Maff's 'contain and destroy' policy on foot and mouth had failed. The Government cannot allow that to happen. Today the big worry is that Scudamore will fail to win over the Cumbrian farmers and the Government will have to move into 'enforcement mode'. With troops on the streets and police at the farm gate it will be far harder for Tony Blair to push through an election on 3 May. That timetable has been in place for three years. With Labour miles ahead in the polls, any delay is a gamble. The stakes over the next 48 hours are very high. Chancellor Gordon Brown and Environment Minister Michael Meacher will announce a multi-million pound rescue package on Tuesday. There will be cash for farmers and, it is thought, soft loans for the battered rural tourism and leisure industry. It may head off the growing anger of Britain's rural communities, never Labour's natural constituency. Then again, it may not. But while the farmers rage about a distant and disorganised government, an Observer investigation has revealed that one of the main catalysts for the ferocious spread of the disease - among the most infectious known to man - may have been illegal movements of livestock by the farmers themselves. In the two weeks after the first case of foot and mouth was discovered in a sow at an Essex abattoir on 19 February, hundreds of farmers throughout the country ignored restrictions imposed to control the outbreak. The movements, usually carried out under darkness, are still continuing according to local government authorities charged with stopping them and prosecuting wrongdoers. In the worst cases farmers are being investigated for trying to deliberately infect their animals and claim compensation. Local council trading standards officers at 15 of the 28 councils with infected farms in their territory told The Observer that they are preparing to prosecute a total of 24 farmers. They stressed that they have only been able to apprehend a tiny fraction of the lawbreakers. 'We know that across the country there have been hundreds of individual movements of sheep, pigs and cattle, either on the same farm or between separate properties,' one trading standards source said. 'But it is very hard to get enough evidence to go to court.' Nationwide, scores of prosecutions are expected. Maff has ordered that no sheep should be moved within 10kms (6.5 miles) of an infected farm. That means hundreds of thousands of sheep left out in the cold, without fodder, in the run-up to lambing. The temptation to move the livestock to safety can prove too great to resist. Ken Yorston, trading standards manager in Montgomeryshire, branded farmers who broke the law 'grossly irresponsible'. He stressed that it was a single smuggled sheep from Cumbria to a farm in South Armagh that brought the virus over the Irish Sea and into Northern Ireland. Though just one animal had the disease, the discovery of foot and mouth prompted panic and the slaughter of 1,000 pigs, 400 cattle and 250 sheep. Last week Norman Dalgarno, a 49-year-old sheep farmer from Tregony in Cornwall, was fined \u00a33,500 after caught moving eight sheep from one field to another several miles away. He later admitted he had moved around 50 animals. The prosecutions represent the 'tip of the iceberg', say trading standards officers. In Devon, Cumbria and Powys nearly 200 individual movements of animals that breached the restrictions have been reported. The true amount of illegal transporting is far larger. 'In the countryside people stick together, so when they do call in it is because they have seen something that they are genuinely very angry with,' said Phil Ashcroft, a trading standards official with Cumbria County Council. Cumbrian trading standards are hoping to prosecute two farmers next week who they believe moved healthy sheep to fields adjacent to a farm infected with the virus in order to infect them and claim compensation payments - currently farmers are paid a good rate for slaughtered animals in a very slack market. 'They will be interviewed next week and if we get enough evidence we will prosecute them,' a Cumbrian investigator said. Officials in Staffordshire suspect a farmer of deliberately not taking anti-foot and mouth precautions because he planned to leave farming and wanted to claim compensation before he sold up. The farmer's animals, however, are still uninfected. His property is now being observed by trading standards officers. There is also concern that farmers are still feeding unprocessed swill to pigs, despite suspicions that this caused the initial disease outbreak at a farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumbria. Swill, usually a mix of leftovers from schools, canteens and restaurants, has to be heat-treated to kill viruses before it is fed to pigs. Last week three pig keepers - two with business links to the Heddon farm - admitted keeping improperly treated swill on their premises. Two were fined. The truth is that no one knows where the disease comes from. And no one knows how much the out break is going to cost. Last week the respected Centre for Economic and Business Research estimated a \u00a39bn bill. Economists are divided over its impact. Some were confident that Britain's strong economy would be unaffected. Others felt the country could be forced into a recession. Worst hit, says the CEBR, will be the travel industry. 'The image of Britain now is of beef burning not beefeaters. That's hardly attractive to holidaymakers,' said Paul Crawford, a CEBR analyst. The loss to the economy will be mitigated by the diversion of money not spent on rural tourism. However \u00a39bn is more than one per cent of the country's gross domestic product for the year, and the tax receipts lost by the Treasury will be three times greater than the tax cuts made by the Chancellor in the Budget. Some economists have talked of a 'confluence of negative factors' that could spark serious problems for everyone. But in the fields, cottages and barns, the hurt is more personal. Yesterday 78-year-old Robert Brough walked to the gates of his 200-acre Cumbrian farm, bolted them and carefully arranged a 'Keep Out' sign. On the hills around him smoke plumes rose from the pits where his neighbour's cherished flocks were burning. 'I know it won't stop the disease - but it might hold up the Maff vets for a bit,' he says, with a weak smile. 'This farm is my life. Now it is going to be reduced to nothing. It has become a killing field.' \u0095 Additional reporting by John Arlidge in Scotland, Ed Helmore in New York and Kate Connolly in Berlin Step by step to meltdown In only a month, Britain has gone from the first sighting of the disease to turmoil throughout the country: \u0095 Outbreak discovered on 10 February at an Essex abattoir and traced to a pig farm in Northumbria. Two days later a quarantine ban is imposed on two farms that had supplied livestock for slaughter. Too late. \u0095 Now more than 160,000 animals have been destroyed with hundreds of thousands more to come. There are 282 confirmed cases of the disease with nine new ones reported yesterday. One of the fresh cases is in the previously disease-free county of Shropshire. \u0095 The National Farmers Union estimates foot and mouth is costing agriculture \u00a364 million pounds a week. The total cost to Britain is expected to run into billions. Culture Secretary Chris Smith is considering aid to the tourist industry which fears a 'lost summer' if the crisis continues. \u0095 Timing of a general election expected to be called for 3 May is under threat. Thousands of other events across Britain have already been cancelled, from hunts to horse racing meetings to St. Patrick's Day parades. \u0095 The Government vows to press ahead with mass cull of up to one million animals to create 'firebreaks' around infected areas, mainly in Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway, to halt virus's spread. \u0095 Militant farmers groups promise a 'rural revolt' to prevent the slaughter of healthy animals. They accuse the Government of sacrificing their flocks for political ends. What's going on?

I think the political settlement was a sell-out, so many people lost their lives. But I wanted to get to know my four children and see them growing up. I was in jail for nine years, firstly for trying to assassinate Laurence Kennedy (leader of the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland during the late Eighties and early Nineties) and then for Billy Wright.</p> <p>'Once I got out it never left my mind that I would always be a target for loyalists for the rest of my life. That I could accept, and I built as much security around myself as possible. But about a month ago an ex-comrade of mine in the INLA came to me and said I was in a lot of trouble because of the people I was associating with, the Notarantonios. These were my friends, they were people who looked after me in jail and I couldn't ignore them. Two weeks ago the INLA came and told me that they could no longer protect me if I kept associating with that family. The INLA man said the IRA was carrying out investigations into me.'</p> <p>Kennaway said he believed the IRA imagined he was some kind of threat: 'Maybe they saw me as a rallying-figure for young nationalists and republicans who admired what I did in the Maze to Billy Wright.'</p> <p>Shortly after Wright was buried in his native Portadown, the INLA's political wing, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, printed T-shirts to commemorate the killing. They depicted a rat with a gun target on its back caught inside a giant H.</p> <p>The words, plagiarised from a Boomtown Rats hit, below the image stated: 'It's a rat trap Billy, and you've been caught.' In nationalist areas the T-shirts sold like hot cakes. Wright, the Portadown-based loyalist, was a hate figure among nationalists for helping to organise scores of sectarian murders in Mid-Ulster.</p> <p>However, when pressed on whether he has now joined the anti-ceasefire Real IRA - the group responsible for the Omagh atrocity - Kennaway denied it. 'My war is over,' he said. 'The reason I'm giving this interview is that I'm afraid they (the IRA) will try to portray me as Real IRA. I'm 38 now. I want to build a new life.'</p> <p>Kennaway said he supports the right of groups like the Real IRA to carry on the 'armed struggle' and has spoken out against attacks by mainstream republicans on the dissidents in west Belfast.</p> <p>Acutely security conscious, he has not been living at his home in recent weeks fearing he could suffer the same fate as Joseph O'Connor, the Real IRA member shot dead by the Provisionals last October.</p> <p>'I honestly believe the IRA see me as some kind of threat, which I'm not,' Kennaway said. 'Even if they don't target me, as a friend in the INLA warned me, they would get to me through my son John. He was a tearaway when I was in prison and once I was released I was determined to straighten him out, but now they've done this.'</p> <p>Kennaway points to a leaflet on the kitchen table, distributed the day before by IRA members, which accuses several families and teenagers of anti-social activities in the Ballymurphy and Springhill area. Among those youths named is his son.</p> <p>Billy Wright's assassin is at first reticent to talk about his role in killing the Loyalist Volunteer Force's founder inside the Maze. He points out that he has left the INLA and will not betray any of their operations.</p> <p>But when he is asked about security at the prison during the period leading up to Wright's murder, Kennaway smiles.</p> <p>'Before we killed Wright security had all but collapsed in the Maze. We were getting drink into the jail every week. A loyalist even managed to smuggle a puppy dog into H6 before he was caught with it on the wings. It was a joke. Remember that myself and my comrade who killed Wright, Crip McWilliams, had already smuggled guns into another jail, Maghaberry prison before that.</p> <p>'This was funny because when we were transferred to the Maze and into H-block 6, which we shared with the LVF, the loyalists were taunting us. They were laughing at us saying that we could have used the guns in Maghaberry to shoot their leaders there. But we were only ever interested in taking out Billy Wright.</p> <p>'He was directing the murder of Catholics by the LVF from his prison cell. Every time the LVF killed a Catholic on the outside Wright's men would cheer and play their flutes on their wing of the H-block. But they were total fools.'</p> <p>Kennaway said he and the two other prisoners involved in the assassination were well aware of the consequences.</p> <p>'We discussed it in our cells; we all volunteered freely and were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail. We knew that we would be caught, that's why on the day we did not wear balaclavas or gloves once we got the gun inside.'</p> <p>On the killing itself, Kennaway claims that the prison alarm system actually helped them pen Wright, who was waiting in a van for a post-Christmas visit, inside the courtyard.</p> <p>'When we cut out of wing and got on to the roof we were actually depending on the screws to be around, to see us. We wanted them to be there to sound the alarm, which leads to the automatic lock-down of the gates. We got into the courtyard and Wright's van was stuck there because the gates were automatically locked. If there had been no alarm the truth is that Wright might have got away and survived. The joke is that the screws thought we were trying to escape, that's why they shut the gates. Had they not have seen us the gate would have been open and the van could have driven away when we pulled out the guns.'</p> <p>Kennaway revealed that he was actually unarmed when he held up the prison driver in the van: 'The driver was meant to think I was armed but the truth is I didn't have the gun - it was Crip that fired the shots into the van.'</p> <p>The former INLA prisoner said he supported Billy Wright's father's demand for a public inquiry into the killing. 'There is no doubt about it that security was a joke in the Maze. We took a risk smuggling the guns in, but it was not impossible.'</p> <p>He admitted that he was lucky to avoid a life sentence, thanks to the Good Friday Agreement and the early release scheme for paramilitary prisoners.</p> <p>'I was resigned to the fact that I would spend the rest of my life inside prison for killing Billy Wright,' he said. 'I knew that even while we were planning to kill him. It's true that we got out of jail on the IRA's backs; that their ceasefire and Sinn Fein's support for the Agreement helped us get free.'</p> <p>Kennaway added that he acccepts that he is a hunted man. He will never be able to shop or socialise in Belfast city centre. There are parts of Northern Ireland he can never visit.</p> <p>But while republican sources dismiss his concerns over IRA threats on his life, alleging paranoia on the part of the ex-prisoner, Kennaway is deeply bitter that it is fellow republicans who are orchestrating a campaign against his son and possibly even himself.</p> <p>'To people who say the IRA would never take me out, I just say to them: what about Joe O'Connor? I know I have got to be careful and the hurtful thing is it's not only loyalists I have to worry about.'</p>",

Speaking at a safe house in west Belfast yesterday, the 38-year-old INLA prisoner, who was released early under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, said he had 'absolutely no regrets' about helping to kill Wright, but felt bitter that other republicans were vilifying him and his son, John junior. The diminutive convicted INLA killer claimed he had incurred the IRA's wrath because of his association with the Notarantonios, a republican family in Belfast whose nephew, a Real IRA member, was shot dead by the Provisionals last October. Chain smoking in the back kitchen of the house on a staunchly republican estate, Kennaway told The Observer why he has broken his silence for the first time since Wright was murdered. 'I got out of jail last October and I broke all my links with the INLA in order to start a new life. I think the political settlement was a sell-out, so many people lost their lives. But I wanted to get to know my four children and see them growing up. I was in jail for nine years, firstly for trying to assassinate Laurence Kennedy (leader of the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland during the late Eighties and early Nineties) and then for Billy Wright. 'Once I got out it never left my mind that I would always be a target for loyalists for the rest of my life. That I could accept, and I built as much security around myself as possible. But about a month ago an ex-comrade of mine in the INLA came to me and said I was in a lot of trouble because of the people I was associating with, the Notarantonios. These were my friends, they were people who looked after me in jail and I couldn't ignore them. Two weeks ago the INLA came and told me that they could no longer protect me if I kept associating with that family. The INLA man said the IRA was carrying out investigations into me.' Kennaway said he believed the IRA imagined he was some kind of threat: 'Maybe they saw me as a rallying-figure for young nationalists and republicans who admired what I did in the Maze to Billy Wright.' Shortly after Wright was buried in his native Portadown, the INLA's political wing, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, printed T-shirts to commemorate the killing. They depicted a rat with a gun target on its back caught inside a giant H. The words, plagiarised from a Boomtown Rats hit, below the image stated: 'It's a rat trap Billy, and you've been caught.' In nationalist areas the T-shirts sold like hot cakes. Wright, the Portadown-based loyalist, was a hate figure among nationalists for helping to organise scores of sectarian murders in Mid-Ulster. However, when pressed on whether he has now joined the anti-ceasefire Real IRA - the group responsible for the Omagh atrocity - Kennaway denied it. 'My war is over,' he said. 'The reason I'm giving this interview is that I'm afraid they (the IRA) will try to portray me as Real IRA. I'm 38 now. I want to build a new life.' Kennaway said he supports the right of groups like the Real IRA to carry on the 'armed struggle' and has spoken out against attacks by mainstream republicans on the dissidents in west Belfast. Acutely security conscious, he has not been living at his home in recent weeks fearing he could suffer the same fate as Joseph O'Connor, the Real IRA member shot dead by the Provisionals last October. 'I honestly believe the IRA see me as some kind of threat, which I'm not,' Kennaway said. 'Even if they don't target me, as a friend in the INLA warned me, they would get to me through my son John. He was a tearaway when I was in prison and once I was released I was determined to straighten him out, but now they've done this.' Kennaway points to a leaflet on the kitchen table, distributed the day before by IRA members, which accuses several families and teenagers of anti-social activities in the Ballymurphy and Springhill area. Among those youths named is his son. Billy Wright's assassin is at first reticent to talk about his role in killing the Loyalist Volunteer Force's founder inside the Maze. He points out that he has left the INLA and will not betray any of their operations. But when he is asked about security at the prison during the period leading up to Wright's murder, Kennaway smiles. 'Before we killed Wright security had all but collapsed in the Maze. We were getting drink into the jail every week. A loyalist even managed to smuggle a puppy dog into H6 before he was caught with it on the wings. It was a joke. Remember that myself and my comrade who killed Wright, Crip McWilliams, had already smuggled guns into another jail, Maghaberry prison before that. 'This was funny because when we were transferred to the Maze and into H-block 6, which we shared with the LVF, the loyalists were taunting us. They were laughing at us saying that we could have used the guns in Maghaberry to shoot their leaders there. But we were only ever interested in taking out Billy Wright. 'He was directing the murder of Catholics by the LVF from his prison cell. Every time the LVF killed a Catholic on the outside Wright's men would cheer and play their flutes on their wing of the H-block. But they were total fools.' Kennaway said he and the two other prisoners involved in the assassination were well aware of the consequences. 'We discussed it in our cells; we all volunteered freely and were willing to spend the rest of our lives in jail. We knew that we would be caught, that's why on the day we did not wear balaclavas or gloves once we got the gun inside.' On the killing itself, Kennaway claims that the prison alarm system actually helped them pen Wright, who was waiting in a van for a post-Christmas visit, inside the courtyard. 'When we cut out of wing and got on to the roof we were actually depending on the screws to be around, to see us. We wanted them to be there to sound the alarm, which leads to the automatic lock-down of the gates. We got into the courtyard and Wright's van was stuck there because the gates were automatically locked. If there had been no alarm the truth is that Wright might have got away and survived. The joke is that the screws thought we were trying to escape, that's why they shut the gates. Had they not have seen us the gate would have been open and the van could have driven away when we pulled out the guns.' Kennaway revealed that he was actually unarmed when he held up the prison driver in the van: 'The driver was meant to think I was armed but the truth is I didn't have the gun - it was Crip that fired the shots into the van.' The former INLA prisoner said he supported Billy Wright's father's demand for a public inquiry into the killing. 'There is no doubt about it that security was a joke in the Maze. We took a risk smuggling the guns in, but it was not impossible.' He admitted that he was lucky to avoid a life sentence, thanks to the Good Friday Agreement and the early release scheme for paramilitary prisoners. 'I was resigned to the fact that I would spend the rest of my life inside prison for killing Billy Wright,' he said. 'I knew that even while we were planning to kill him. It's true that we got out of jail on the IRA's backs; that their ceasefire and Sinn Fein's support for the Agreement helped us get free.' Kennaway added that he acccepts that he is a hunted man. He will never be able to shop or socialise in Belfast city centre. There are parts of Northern Ireland he can never visit. But while republican sources dismiss his concerns over IRA threats on his life, alleging paranoia on the part of the ex-prisoner, Kennaway is deeply bitter that it is fellow republicans who are orchestrating a campaign against his son and possibly even himself. 'To people who say the IRA would never take me out, I just say to them: what about Joe O'Connor? I know I have got to be careful and the hurtful thing is it's not only loyalists I have to worry about.'",

Rachel O'Connell, director of research at the Cyberspace Research Unit, in Preston, Lancashire, said: 'When teenagers go online for the first time, many are not aware of the warning signs - like when somebody asks for personal information, or asks to meet them offline [in the real world]. Those kinds of requests should set off alarm bells in teenagers' heads, just as the sound of an oncoming car would warn them not to step out into the street.' </p> <p>But some parents tend to overreact. O'Connell said: 'It would be such a shame if parents panicked about the internet and stopped their children using it, because it's such a wonderful place. </p> <p>'A much more effective way to ensure a child's safety would be to go through the safety guidelines with them. Just as they would teach a child to cross the road safely, parents should initially accompany their children online.' </p> <p>Safety guidelines are freely available on dozens of websites, including cyberangels.com and chatdanger.com.

More mystifying still are the chat rooms - websites where complete strangers can talk to each other about whatever they like, with as much anonymity as they wish. 'Chat rooms are great,' said Ben, 14, 'because you can make up so much about yourself.' But there are people, such as paedophiles, waiting to take advantage. Kierra said: 'Bad things about chat-rooms are people who lie all the time. Like, \"Honest, I'm 14.\" Except I'm a 55-year-old bald man named Malcolm. Or he'll say, \"My name's Sadie, I'm 13 and I like Barbie. Do you?\"' Unlike Kierra, many teenagers don't recognise the dangers. Rachel O'Connell, director of research at the Cyberspace Research Unit, in Preston, Lancashire, said: 'When teenagers go online for the first time, many are not aware of the warning signs - like when somebody asks for personal information, or asks to meet them offline [in the real world]. Those kinds of requests should set off alarm bells in teenagers' heads, just as the sound of an oncoming car would warn them not to step out into the street.' But some parents tend to overreact. O'Connell said: 'It would be such a shame if parents panicked about the internet and stopped their children using it, because it's such a wonderful place. 'A much more effective way to ensure a child's safety would be to go through the safety guidelines with them. Just as they would teach a child to cross the road safely, parents should initially accompany their children online.' Safety guidelines are freely available on dozens of websites, including cyberangels.com and chatdanger.com. O'Connell is working on an EU-funded project to bring education about online safety into schools and homes. \u0095 Children's Express is a programme of learning through journalism for young people aged from eight to 18.

Six months on, and with nearly 430 dead and Sharon now installed as Israel's Prime Minister, the Palestinians are confronting the same old question: What are we fighting for, and what is the best way to get it?

At a funeral in Ramallah last week, activists called for a ban on what has become the customary parade of masked men firing automatic weapons in the air. A town meeting called for renewed contacts with Jewish peace activists, so that they in turn could put pressure on the Israeli government. Lawyers demanded that the legal union call elections which are long overdue, and which have been resisted by the governing Fatah council. In nearby El-Bireh, and in Beit Jala, a suburb of Bethlehem, widespread anger at the gunmen whose nightly pot shots at Jewish settlements have provoked devastating reprisals from the Israeli army forced Fatah commanders to order a new ban on the use of firearms in popular areas.

'The Palestinians realise now that all this shooting never achieved their aim, and it damaged their cause in the international community and media.' Nobody is talking about a ban on throwing stones - which Palestinians regard as a symbolic form of protest - and most people see Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers as legitimate targets in a fight against Israel's 34-year-long occupation. There is also great uneasiness about asking Palestinian civilians to turn out for mass rallies because of the Israeli army's use of sharpshooters who have picked off protest leaders with lethal effect. 'I think Israel took a decision from the beginning on a tactical and field level to take an approach to the intifada that prevented it from being a peaceful and mass movement,' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian analyst who organised civil disobedience in the first intifada in the 1980s.

Every good grade is celebrated; every note in the homework diary that applauds effort or improvement is greeted with joy and pride.</p> <p>Over the years I have been extremely fortunate, as both my kids, Jemima and Zac, have worked hard at school and their reports make considerably happier reading than anything my parents were confronted with.</p> <p>On the education front there appeared to be no worries. Or so I thought. A couple of months ago Jessica, my wife, called me at work with the news that Jemima's teacher had been on the phone and wanted to chat about our daughter. Apparently things had slipped a bit. Homework wasn't being done, corrections were being overlooked and there had been a big drop in standards.</p> <p>This came as a shock. It was a complete about-turn from what we had become used to and it needed to be sorted out. We also needed to discover what had caused it. We racked our brains. Was she unhappy about something? Were there problems at school with bullying? Ten-year-old girls can be pretty sharp-tongued.</p> <p>The answer was far simpler and was lurking at the top of the house. Back in September we bought Jemima a computer game she had wanted for her birthday. It was called 'Babyz' and the object was to raise and care for virtual infants.

It became clear that Jemima had been keeping up with her new-found internet friends and in particular someone called Debbie. We'd heard a lot about Debbie.

All very innocent up to that point, but things were heading for a darker turn.</p> <p>One Friday last month, Jemima was off school because of a dental appointment. Debbie was not at school either, though I didn't know why. The following day Debbie offered to start building graphics. Over the weekend the messages came thick and fast. Debbie sent the graphics and asked that they should be put on the site as soon as possible.</p> <p>Occasionally her tone appeared quite abrupt and she was using two different email addresses. The following Monday Jemima and Debbie had a long 'chat' about what they wanted to do when they were older. Jemima said she wanted to do something with graphic design, as she loved to draw, while Debbie said she wanted to write and suggested they do a book together. Having always signed off 'kisses', Debbie now said, 'love you always. Sleep well'.</p> <p>And so it went on. They communicated every day, and in the process Jemima introduced a school friend to Debbie. Debbie kept sending graphics for the website, but it became apparent that despite Jemima's requests to see Debbie's Babyz she wasn't going to. They were sick or they had died, according to Debbie.</p> <p>We went away for half term, but when we got back the messages were of a different nature. Debbie talked about wanting to live in the US, 'with an American for a man'. She also wanted to adopt children because 'I don't like to walk with a big belly I think'.</p> <p>Debbie came back online on Saturday, 3 March, after claiming to be ill. Now she wanted to make up a story about Jemima when she was older.</p> <p>It began: 'You are 23 and you have two children. One girl of five years old and a boy of two. Then you find out that you are pregnant. When you want to tell it to your man, he says \"I want to tell you something first. I am in love with another woman\". What do you do??'</p> <p>All day the story went on. Jemima is saved from being run over by a stranger and, according to Debbie, thanks him by going to the 'sleeping room' and 'doing it'. The story often put the onus on Jemima to describe things, trying to lead her. 'You chat with him and then as you get up to go to your bed... he follows. And then you say, \"What are your plans?\" You give him a kiss. And what happens then? And he stays with you. What happens?'</p> <p>She was also asked how she felt when a man touched her leg. Did she like it? Was it nice? Debbie's story for Jemima was wound up only after Jemima had been through countless fictional sexual encounters for her virtual children.</p> <p>In the evening Debbie began a story about herself. The story continued off and on for three days. Debbie went through a number of men and kept her child in an attic. In one section she found one of her men with another woman. 'I say, \"What's the matter? You are a big Asshole man, a big asshole.\" And to the woman I say... Yesterday I did it with him, and now he wants to do it with you.'</p> <p>All through the story Jemima kept trying to steer off the subject, but was sucked back in because she wanted Debbie to send her more graphics. After the transmission there was one more that included a graphic. Disturbingly it asked: 'When do we go further with my story?' Jemima's school friend also received some 'stories' from Debbie, and her parents, like Jessica and I, have now stopped any further contact with Debbie.</p> <p>Jemima was clearly shocked by what she read, but said she felt compelled to reply because of the graphics. It became a bizarre addiction that almost ran out of control. Frighteningly she admitted that had Debbie asked for contact details she probably would have given them. She trusted her.

      "bodyText": "Like the vast majority of parents I revel in the successes of my children. Every good grade is celebrated; every note in the homework diary that applauds effort or improvement is greeted with joy and pride. Over the years I have been extremely fortunate, as both my kids, Jemima and Zac, have worked hard at school and their reports make considerably happier reading than anything my parents were confronted with. On the education front there appeared to be no worries. Or so I thought. A couple of months ago Jessica, my wife, called me at work with the news that Jemima's teacher had been on the phone and wanted to chat about our daughter. Apparently things had slipped a bit. Homework wasn't being done, corrections were being overlooked and there had been a big drop in standards. This came as a shock. It was a complete about-turn from what we had become used to and it needed to be sorted out. We also needed to discover what had caused it. We racked our brains. Was she unhappy about something? Were there problems at school with bullying? Ten-year-old girls can be pretty sharp-tongued. The answer was far simpler and was lurking at the top of the house. Back in September we bought Jemima a computer game she had wanted for her birthday. It was called 'Babyz' and the object was to raise and care for virtual infants. It provided hours of fun but it was also the catalyst for a sinister chain of events, the potential consequences of which don't bear thinking about. 'Babyz' players came from all over the world and displayed their 'kids' on websites which offered the latest 'Babyz' fashions and even virtual schools and baby-sitting services. Jemima wanted to be a part of this and set about building her own site. I was chuffed. The problem with hosting a website is that it requires maintenance. This is time-consuming and costly, as we discovered with the arrival of a crippling phone bill. Jemima's creation had brought her into contact with 'Babyz' fans from all over the world. In the car on the way to school she would update me with who had signed her guest book and how many hits she had. The internet never sleeps, so at the crack of dawn she would scuttle to the top of the house and log on to see who had visited from America, New Zealand and anywhere in between. Through trial and error she had taught herself any number of new skills. The big snag, apart from the cost, was how all-consuming this had become. The birth of the website tied in with Jemima's downturn in performance at school. Jessica and I decided we would have to limit severely the time Jemima spent online. The internet was banned during the week, but at weekends she could update her site and catch up with all her new faceless friends. Problem solved. Just before half term Jemima got some very good exam results and it appeared we were back on track, until the next phone bill arrived. While not as bad as the last one, it still made the eyes water. Obviously there was still some midweek internet action going on. Jessica took a look at the emails and I could tell by the look on her face when I returned from work that it hadn't been pleasant.

      "body": "<p>At about 2.30 last Saturday afternoon, my doorbell rang. On the step was a tall man in a dark suit, holding some papers. I thought he was an estate agent, but he announced himself as a reporter from the News of the World. This was unnerving enough in itself, but his inquiry had a sinister, unpleasant edge. 'You have a daughter,' he said. 'What do you think of these photographs?' He then showed me colour photocopies of some of the pictures from the now infamous exhibition of Tierney Gearon's portraits of her children at the Saatchi Gallery.</p> <p>I didn't comment. He persisted with his questioning. 'What about this one? Don't you think it suggests oral sex?' I said goodbye and closed the door.</p> <p>So why did the News of the World come knocking? Why were they so concerned about an exhibition at a private gallery that had already been on show for seven weeks and which, as the paper itself admitted, was seen only by 'upper-crust art lovers'? And why were they taking such a personal interest in me?</p> <p>The previous day, the police had acted on a complaint from a member of the public - it is not beyond the realms of possibility that this was a News of the World reporter - and warned the Saatchi Gallery that it faced prosecution under the Protection of Children Act unless two of Ms Gearon's photographs, in which her children are unclothed, were removed. The exhibition is sponsored by the Independent on Sunday, of which I am editor-in-chief. In the normal course of events, I might expect to be telephoned for a comment.</p> <p>It is at this point that the political becomes the personal. When Rebekah Wade took over as editor of the News of the World last summer, she gained instant notoriety by launching, in the wake of the murder of Sarah Payne, a campaign to name and shame paedophiles, promising to print the pictures of every sex offender in Britain. The Independent, together with the Daily Telegraph, the NSPCC, the police, the probation service and many MPs, took a stand against this campaign. Ms Wade attacked me in a leader column, saying I was out of tune with public opinion and that I 'know nothing of the real world'. Two weeks later, her campaign, which had resulted in civil disorder, the victimisation of innocent citizens, the driving underground of known sex offenders and the release of convicted paedophiles, was abandoned.</p> <p>There was, and is, something distasteful about the serious issue of child abuse being turned into a spat between two newspaper editors. But when I telephoned Ms Wade last Saturday to express my concern about being 'doorstepped' by one of her reporters, she revealed something of her motives and of the newspaper's modus operandi .</p> <p>She professed shock that I had been visited by a reporter. 'That's terrible,' she said, incredulously. 'I just asked them to get a comment from you. I'll find out who did it and have a word. It's awful that your daughter was dragged into it.' I, too, found it surprising that they would go to the trouble of coming to my home when all they wanted was a simple quote. Also, how did they get my address? I then remembered that an hour or so before the doorbell rang, I had had a phone call from the TV licensing department asking me to confirm my address. Surely this was a coincidence too far.</p> <p>I felt wrong-footed by the whole experience, and not a little paranoid; the first thing I did was to remove a picture of my 11-year-old daughter in a swimsuit from my wall. (As a newspaper editor, I understand that I have a limited right to feel squeamish about the ways of the media. It did make me realise, however, how threatened and distressed ordinary members of the public must feel when confronted by these tactics.)</p> <p>I gave Ms Wade a comment about the exhibition, which she took down, and the paper represented faithfully the next day. She then said: 'Don't worry, I shan't be calling for your resignation', a reference to our dispute over her name-and-shame campaign. 'In fact,' she said, 'every time you call for my resignation, Rupert gives me a pay rise.' So there we have it: whatever the rights and wrongs of this campaign, it did at least raise her profile, please her proprietor and boost her pay packet.</p> <p>Seven months on, the criticism clearly still rankles with Ms Wade; she even remembers our headline, even though she dismissively refers to the Independent as an 'unpopular, low-circulation offering'. So last Sunday, hiding behind the moral indignation about the 'vile' and 'lurid' exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery, she returned to the personal attack. In a leading article, she effectively accused me, and my newspaper, of promoting paedophilia. We were guilty of 'backing a revolting exhibition of perversion under the guise of art' and I had sought to justify a 'degrading exploitation of child nudity for commercial gain'.</p> <p>She obviously didn't feel too upset by the photographs, because she used a selection of them over two pages of her newspaper. But to spare her readers' delicate sensibilities, she blacked out the children's genitals. This, as the artist pointed out eloquently last week, had the effect of making them look like pages torn from a pornographic magazine, particularly in the context of the genuinely sordid material that makes up the News of the World 's news pages. When viewed as they are meant to be (ie on a gallery wall), these photographs are anything but exploitative. It is difficult to imagine that anyone could find them arousing, and it surprised nobody when, last Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service ruled that the photographs were not indecent and that the case was closed.</p> <p>The definition of indecency in law is 'anything likely to offend right-minded people'. The law cannot make the assumption that everyone has paedophile instincts. The issue of how best to protect our children is of paramount concern to all parents. The fuss over some pictures in an exhibition diverts attention from the real dangers our children are prey to every day when they log on to the internet in the sanctuary of their homes.</p> <p>For all the outrage of the News of the World, this was not a debate about the exploitation of children. The exploitation was purely on the part of the News of the World in creating a moral panic while seeking to settle an old score.</p> <p>And the net result? Tierney Gearon, a hitherto unknown photographer, has received attention she could not have anticipated. The Saatchi Gallery has decided to extend the exhibition for another month. And no doubt Rebekah Wade is waiting for the telephone call from Rupert Murdoch offering her a raise. Trebles all round.</p>",

Seven months on, the criticism clearly still rankles with Ms Wade; she even remembers our headline, even though she dismissively refers to the Independent as an 'unpopular, low-circulation offering'. So last Sunday, hiding behind the moral indignation about the 'vile' and 'lurid' exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery, she returned to the personal attack. In a leading article, she effectively accused me, and my newspaper, of promoting paedophilia. We were guilty of 'backing a revolting exhibition of perversion under the guise of art' and I had sought to justify a 'degrading exploitation of child nudity for commercial gain'. She obviously didn't feel too upset by the photographs, because she used a selection of them over two pages of her newspaper. But to spare her readers' delicate sensibilities, she blacked out the children's genitals. This, as the artist pointed out eloquently last week, had the effect of making them look like pages torn from a pornographic magazine, particularly in the context of the genuinely sordid material that makes up the News of the World 's news pages. When viewed as they are meant to be (ie on a gallery wall), these photographs are anything but exploitative. It is difficult to imagine that anyone could find them arousing, and it surprised nobody when, last Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service ruled that the photographs were not indecent and that the case was closed. The definition of indecency in law is 'anything likely to offend right-minded people'. The law cannot make the assumption that everyone has paedophile instincts. The issue of how best to protect our children is of paramount concern to all parents. The fuss over some pictures in an exhibition diverts attention from the real dangers our children are prey to every day when they log on to the internet in the sanctuary of their homes. For all the outrage of the News of the World, this was not a debate about the exploitation of children. The exploitation was purely on the part of the News of the World in creating a moral panic while seeking to settle an old score. And the net result? Tierney Gearon, a hitherto unknown photographer, has received attention she could not have anticipated. The Saatchi Gallery has decided to extend the exhibition for another month. And no doubt Rebekah Wade is waiting for the telephone call from Rupert Murdoch offering her a raise. Trebles all round.",

Had such an image emerged, it would have been Constable's 'Haywain' in comparison with the Gearon pictures.

The Saatchi case was no more than a media spat initiated by the News of the World, still smarting at the denigration of its naming and shaming child-sex offenders by the 'snooty' Independent. The NoW verdict ('lurid, vile, should be closed down') was not muted in deference to the show's sponsor: the Independent on Sunday .</p> <p>Even so, Gearon's pictures, though neither lurid nor vile, should not be on public view. It is axiomatic that parents do not grossly exploit their children for their own gain. That holds true whether the mother in question is a Romanian refugee sending her toddler through a Tube train carriage with a begging bowl or an ambitious photographer with a reputation to make. The single difference is that the first is driven by fear that her child may starve, while the latter, one imagines, was motivated less by need than by flattery at the interest the influential Charles Saatchi evinced in her charmless family snapshots.</p> <p>If she was disturbed by the controversy, Gearon did not show it. On the contrary, she inflated the debate, denying in interviews illustrated with the notorious pictures, that her children would have future problems. 'I don't think they will be embarrassed, because I have never made them feel ashamed of their bodies, or of their nudity,' she said. Even if true, that is not the issue. Children have rights too, and being a parent is not an exemption clause from their observance.

The rules of 'hyper-parenting' decree that children are fragile and vulnerable, whereas they are actually tough survivors being mollycoddled half to death, according to Furedi, whose arguments are threaded with nostalgia. Oh, for the good old days, when playgrounds were full of swings and slides so high that a fall (on to traditional concrete rather than the rubber now demanded by irrational safety freaks) would smash small skulls like eggshells. But not many died, Furedi argues, for lack of safety precautions or of a supervising parent with better things to do. In his Zolaesque Utopia, fathers staggered home from 12-hour factory shifts, mothers worked correspondingly hard, and there was no feeble hand-wringing about getting more time with the children.</p> <p>There is not a word about the flaws or the autocracy of those who believed it their children's duty to absorb and honour unquestioningly the parental take on morality (rigid), religion (plentiful), and sex (never before marriage).</p> <p>The new generation of parents, however over-attentive or over-anxious, has a more open, respectful and generous relationship with its children. Furedi does not say so. Nor does he explain how his scorn for social determinism squares with the irrefutable linkage between deprivation and failure. In scoffing at unnecessary worries over 'children at risk', he does not mention the result, for children like Chelsea Brown and Anna Climbie, when such insouciance is duly observed. Most irritating of all is the inference that Furedi's experience of fatherhood qualifies him to lecture, Dr Spockishly, on how the rest of us are getting it wrong. Like Tierney Gearon, he would have been wiser to leave his family out of it.</p> <p>None the less, Furedi is sometimes right.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'We take our Christian faith seriously, which helps when it comes to praying for money - which we need to a lot,' laughs Judi Apichella, 45. 'Having five children makes life expensive, obviously, and though we wouldn't want it any other way, it isn't always easy.' </p> <p>Judi and husband Michael, 47, always knew they wanted several children. 'The first four were planned, and the last one had been talked about if not exactly planned,' says Judi. 'We love children, we love a busy house with lots going on - and there's always room for one more.' </p> <p>For several years life was a bit of a squeeze for the Apichellas. 'We had a three-bedroom house with one downstairs loo in Oxfordshire, and there were seven of us. It was tight - our youngest, Michael, shared our bedroom until he was nearly three, which wasn't ideal.' </p> <p>A job opportunity for Michael, a writer, in East Anglia, meant the chance to move somewhere with cheaper housing. 'Our current home has three bedrooms, but it's a lot bigger all round,' says Judi. 'We're currently trying to buy the flat next door to expand into - it's very exciting for the older girls, Maria, 15, and Lizzy, 14, because they'll have their own bedrooms for the first time in their life.' </p> <p>Having a big family forces the family to think creatively about solutions to their economic problems - as with the decision to buy the adjoining flat. </p> <p>Another creative decision was to educate Maria at home for a year when they felt she needed extra help. 'We'd moved her to a private school in Oxfordshire, but it was hard to afford. Then we moved over here so had to think again anyway. Home schooling was hard work, especially as I had a pre-school child as well at the time. But it was worth it - a private tutor was something we just couldn't run to.' </p> <p>School trips are out, too. 'We've told the children they just aren't on the agenda,' says Judi. 'It is very hard when they come home and they've had their appetite whetted by some teacher - it makes me really angry, actually - but we just have to say no. </p> <p>We encourage them to do other things, such as sailing with a teen group. The two older girls are trying to save at the moment, and it's hard on them that they don't get pocket money, but they've started babysitting as a team and it's been really good for them.' </p> <p>When Michael, five, started school, Judi turned to childminding to make some extra money. 'Friends thought I was mad - I'd finally got all my own children off to school and here I was taking on other people's toddlers,' she says. 'But it made sense to me. I love children, and it fits in with the needs of running a family of five because I'm home-based.' </p> <p>Judi feels that holidays are something no family can do without, but they have to be budget-priced. Usually, that means borrowing a holiday home or renting an inexpensive house. Shopping, says Judi, isn't as much of a problem as you might think. 'When you've got loads of kids you can't hang out at the shops, so you're not tempted,' she says. </p> <p>'You can't be the kind of person who's easily jealous or you'd be unhappy. In fact I think having a big family makes you quite humble .' </p> <p>'In many ways we do live a mad life. But what's the alternative? For us both to have big full-time jobs? Maybe then we could send the children to private schools, but we'd have to work so hard we'd hardly ever see them. </p> <p>'Life our way is much, much more fun - we wouldn't swap it for anything.'</p>",

Another creative decision was to educate Maria at home for a year when they felt she needed extra help. 'We'd moved her to a private school in Oxfordshire, but it was hard to afford. Then we moved over here so had to think again anyway. Home schooling was hard work, especially as I had a pre-school child as well at the time. But it was worth it - a private tutor was something we just couldn't run to.' School trips are out, too. 'We've told the children they just aren't on the agenda,' says Judi. 'It is very hard when they come home and they've had their appetite whetted by some teacher - it makes me really angry, actually - but we just have to say no. We encourage them to do other things, such as sailing with a teen group. The two older girls are trying to save at the moment, and it's hard on them that they don't get pocket money, but they've started babysitting as a team and it's been really good for them.' When Michael, five, started school, Judi turned to childminding to make some extra money. 'Friends thought I was mad - I'd finally got all my own children off to school and here I was taking on other people's toddlers,' she says. 'But it made sense to me. I love children, and it fits in with the needs of running a family of five because I'm home-based.' Judi feels that holidays are something no family can do without, but they have to be budget-priced. Usually, that means borrowing a holiday home or renting an inexpensive house. Shopping, says Judi, isn't as much of a problem as you might think. 'When you've got loads of kids you can't hang out at the shops, so you're not tempted,' she says. 'You can't be the kind of person who's easily jealous or you'd be unhappy. In fact I think having a big family makes you quite humble .' 'In many ways we do live a mad life. But what's the alternative? For us both to have big full-time jobs? Maybe then we could send the children to private schools, but we'd have to work so hard we'd hardly ever see them. 'Life our way is much, much more fun - we wouldn't swap it for anything.'",

As things are, the family has to keep a tight rein on spending to allow for the school fees. </p> <p>'We did go through a phase of budgeting and set up a spreadsheet on our computer and thought about our monthly income and outgoings,' says Janet. 'We don't do it on a regular basis any more, but it has made me aware of the outgoings, which probably helps.' </p> <p>Downsizing holidays has been one of the ways the family has cut back. 'Several years ago, before we had the children, we bought a cheap cottage in northern France with the money we got from my flat when we married, and now it's the backbone of our holidays,' says Janet. </p> <p>'It's small and it's not near the sea, but it means we can have cheap holidays - although the ferry isn't cheap with a people carrier and the six of us. </p> <p>'We've also joined the Youth Hostel Association and had a weekend away earlier this year in York in a youth hostel. It was great - a lot cheaper than a hotel would have been, and a very easy-going place to stay with lots of children. They all thought it was great.' </p> <p>Getting there by train using a Family Railcard also made good economic sense. Eating out in restaurants is a luxury the family don't run to that often. 'Even going to a pizzeria with our lot costs at least \u00a360,' says Janet. </p> <p>'And when you're out somewhere for the day, going into a cafe for a drink and a snack is horrendously expensive. It helps if I remember to pack everyone a drink and some biscuits - but I'm not always that organised. I think the main difference between us and some other families I know who've either got fewer children or more money or both is that they have more luxuries.

They're billeted in a crumbling tower- block as awful as anything in the suburbs of Moscow or Warsaw, and along with refugees from a hundred other places they're observed by CCTV, monitored by police with dogs, and made to exist without work on vouchers for which no change is ever given. </p> <p>The cold, overcast, thinly-populated Stonehaven is a reflection of Tanya's state of mind, though despite Artiom calling it 'the armpit of the world', it is not put down socially the way Margate was in Lindsay Anderson's 1953 short, O Dreamland, a documentary of Larkinesque misanthropy. Certainly, Tanya and Artiom are strangers in a strange land, but Last Resort is no documentary and indeed is frequently implausible. </p> <p>In fact, it's less a picture about the problems of refugees than a transposition to Europe of a longstanding Hollywood feminist genre that one might call 'the relocation movie'. In these films, a blue-collar widow or divorc\u00e9e pulls up her stakes and, with a querulous son or daughter in tow, drives west in search of a new life and to realise her dreams. </p> <p>Always she encounters two men - one seductive, brutal and exploitative, the other gentle, gauche and helpful - and suffers bitter disappointment and briefly neglects her troubled teenage child before coming to terms with reality. Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is the most famous example, the Susan Sarandon vehicle Anywhere But Here among the most recent. </p> <p> Last Resort touches all the bases of this genre. The bad guys are a pair of filmmakers who inveigle her into participating in erotic videos for the internet.

The League of Gentlemen are approaching levels of cultiness usually associated with their spiritual fathers, Monty Python. </p> <p>The curtain was late going up, so that by the time Reece Shearsmith, Steve Pemberton and Mark Gattis gyrated through the ripples of dry ice to the hard rock strains of 'Voodoo Lady', the audience - many of them with 'Are You Local?', 'Hello Dave' or 'Dole Scum' emblazoned across their T-shirts - were jigging up and down with anticipation like a school trip needing the loo. Johnny-come-lately fans must have been baffled if they'd been expecting the villagers of Royston Vasey to cavort about the stage for two-and-a-half hours. </p> <p>Instead, for the first half of the show, the League returned to the format of their early Fringe material. Dressed in tuxedos, they produced a slick succession of short sketches, some new, some familiar, with scant props and minimal costumes. </p> <p>The Gentlemen have been keen to assert that this is 'a theatrical revue' and not an attempt to recreate a successful television show live. On screen, the actors have successfully bridged the divide between sketch show and sitcom in a similar way to The Fast Show: familiar characters in familiar settings appear in a series of discrete sketches that gradually build up an ongoing narrative. Given the limits of space and time on stage, however, the sketch format comes back into its own. </p> <p>In fact, the first thought that springs to mind as they launch into the first sketch, in which Pemberton and Gattis appear as two football supporters watching Hamlet, is 'so that's what they look like, then'. </p> <p>Without the make-up and costumes that transform them into the largely middle-aged grotesques of Royston Vasey, the three Gentlemen look surprisingly boyish and freshly scrubbed in their dinner jackets, and it's a delight to see them conjuring up different characters, from the mild-mannered doctor trying to comprehend the Byzantine rules of the card game Go Johnny Go Go Go Go, to Captain Scott and his expedition team contemplating mutual masturbation as the fatal blizzard sets in. </p> <p>But the wanking jokes conceal a subtle erudition: the sketches are littered with allusions to Shakespeare, Chekhov, Jean Genet and Dr Faustus . One of the finest new characters is Tish, the Camden Town fag-hag, who tramples all over the sensibilities of her gay 'friends', punctuating her mindless stream-of-consciousnes with air kisses and the refrain 'God, I just love gay guys!' Gradually, though, the famous 'dark edge' seeps in; while Shakespeare may not actually have used the phrase 'Who ate all the pies?' in Hamlet, the League's interpretation of comedy shares much with his later plays. Death, fear and cruelty are only just held at bay by the humour, but the sketches usually pull back from the abyss at the last minute. </p> <p>The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of the first half features Olly Plimsolls of Royston Vasey's theatre group, Legz Akimbo, presenting his experimental new northern verse play, Scumbelina, a magnificent parody of avant-garde theatre and northern realism in general, lampooning the likes of Willy Russell, Tony Harrison, Jim Cartwright and 'John Fucking Godber!', as Plimsolls's 'cast' shouts repeatedly at the end. It's also a clever jibe at the critics' relentless labelling of the League as 'northern comics'. </p> <p>After the interval, the curtain whipped back to reveal a set of Royston Vasey's infamous 'Local Shop', over which the grotesque Edward and Tubbs hover on wires with angel wings. The subsequent story is loosely based on Edward and Tubbs's posthumous mission to revisit Royston Vasey and redeem themselves for the serial killings of anyone not 'local' who attempted to buy their 'precious things'. </p> <p>The audience experienced fresh paroxysms of delight each time a favourite character or catchphrase appeared, but the early pantomime innuendo of camp German teacher Herr Lipp, who drags a frightened 'volunteer' from the audience ('Don't vorry, I made a boy come on stage last night') gives a false sense of security: the sketches featuring the sinister blacked-up ringmaster Papa Lazarou, who abducts women with the inexplicable phrase 'You're my wife now, Dave', and especially the butcher Hillary Briss, who serves up human meat, confirm that horror influences the League's material just as much as Python, and are likely to provide nightmares for weeks to come. </p> <p>While there was a little too much set and costume changing in this half, obliging the audience to listen to voice-overs while looking at a blank curtain, it was undoubtedly what the fans wanted. A Local Show may not be family entertainment, but it's a splendid showcase for the League of Gentlemen's versatile talents.</p>",

The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of the first half features Olly Plimsolls of Royston Vasey's theatre group, Legz Akimbo, presenting his experimental new northern verse play, Scumbelina, a magnificent parody of avant-garde theatre and northern realism in general, lampooning the likes of Willy Russell, Tony Harrison, Jim Cartwright and 'John Fucking Godber!', as Plimsolls's 'cast' shouts repeatedly at the end. It's also a clever jibe at the critics' relentless labelling of the League as 'northern comics'. After the interval, the curtain whipped back to reveal a set of Royston Vasey's infamous 'Local Shop', over which the grotesque Edward and Tubbs hover on wires with angel wings. The subsequent story is loosely based on Edward and Tubbs's posthumous mission to revisit Royston Vasey and redeem themselves for the serial killings of anyone not 'local' who attempted to buy their 'precious things'. The audience experienced fresh paroxysms of delight each time a favourite character or catchphrase appeared, but the early pantomime innuendo of camp German teacher Herr Lipp, who drags a frightened 'volunteer' from the audience ('Don't vorry, I made a boy come on stage last night') gives a false sense of security: the sketches featuring the sinister blacked-up ringmaster Papa Lazarou, who abducts women with the inexplicable phrase 'You're my wife now, Dave', and especially the butcher Hillary Briss, who serves up human meat, confirm that horror influences the League's material just as much as Python, and are likely to provide nightmares for weeks to come. While there was a little too much set and costume changing in this half, obliging the audience to listen to voice-overs while looking at a blank curtain, it was undoubtedly what the fans wanted. A Local Show may not be family entertainment, but it's a splendid showcase for the League of Gentlemen's versatile talents.",

I've suggested just the two of us go somewhere together, but to be honest, I cannot contemplate leaving the country without my children and walking in Iceland is not really on with a four-year-old and a six-month-old baby. He knows this. How can we compromise?<br> N.S. of Reading</p> <p>Memories of childhood holidays follow the law of extremes: they tend to be either blissfully idyllic or horror-stories of endurance. Post-war children of my generation remember trying to be jovial in dingy B&amp;Bs with the whole family crammed into one bedroom. But our parents were doing their best in lean times. Your problems are a bit different.</p> <p>With everyone having different expectations you must aim for a formula that suits them all. The misery of one grumpy member soon diffuses around the rest. Your number one priority is to keep the children contented, which minimises the work for you as well as the irritation.</p> <p>Young children can only take adventure in small doses, do not appreciate wholesale transformations in lifestyle, especially in diet, and are happiest if much of their daily routine is left intact.</p> <p>This means that self-catering holidays are the best compromise. If you discover a place that you love, it's heaven to go back year after year as if going to a home from home. For my family this was the New Forest. Pacing the day is vital, with half a day for an outing, then back home to play or read.</p> <p>Structure a stress-free holiday replete with the simple pleasures of life; child-friendly pubs, walks in wellies over wet heathland, toasting crumpets over a log-fire, wallowing in a wealth of time to stand and stare.</p> <p>You can become so relaxed that you revert to childhood yourself, climbing trees, flying kites, going mad on the dodgems. Hang loose over discipline and dignity.

      "bodyText": "Before I married and had children, I travelled extensively. My husband did not do as much as he would have liked. Now we have a family we have to do 'family-type' holidays. However, my husband finds these hard work and is vocal about the fact he would rather be walking in Iceland or visiting a place he has never been before. I've suggested just the two of us go somewhere together, but to be honest, I cannot contemplate leaving the country without my children and walking in Iceland is not really on with a four-year-old and a six-month-old baby. He knows this. How can we compromise? N.S. of Reading Memories of childhood holidays follow the law of extremes: they tend to be either blissfully idyllic or horror-stories of endurance. Post-war children of my generation remember trying to be jovial in dingy B&amp;Bs with the whole family crammed into one bedroom. But our parents were doing their best in lean times. Your problems are a bit different. With everyone having different expectations you must aim for a formula that suits them all. The misery of one grumpy member soon diffuses around the rest. Your number one priority is to keep the children contented, which minimises the work for you as well as the irritation. Young children can only take adventure in small doses, do not appreciate wholesale transformations in lifestyle, especially in diet, and are happiest if much of their daily routine is left intact. This means that self-catering holidays are the best compromise. If you discover a place that you love, it's heaven to go back year after year as if going to a home from home. For my family this was the New Forest. Pacing the day is vital, with half a day for an outing, then back home to play or read. Structure a stress-free holiday replete with the simple pleasures of life; child-friendly pubs, walks in wellies over wet heathland, toasting crumpets over a log-fire, wallowing in a wealth of time to stand and stare. You can become so relaxed that you revert to childhood yourself, climbing trees, flying kites, going mad on the dodgems. Hang loose over discipline and dignity. Children love creating family customs and you quickly find out the things they adore because they insist on doing a repeat on all subsequent occasions. Many of these traditions involve food - picnics, gathering wild strawberries, cream teas, fish and chips on the last night of the holiday, always munched out of greas paper while ambling along the street. Take bags of basic groceries with you so your precious time isn't wasted buying tea bags and toilet rolls. If your husband isn't fussy, meals can be kept to the sausage-and-beans level without any one coming to much harm. The Icelandic walking trips can easily be postponed for a few years.

A subterranean kitchen where Hitler is gutted and boiled in his own blood? Or an absolute zero - darkness visible, howling silence, the eternal absence of God? </p> <p>The two are not incompatible in Dante's great Inferno, a hell so capacious it can accommodate both in its infinite megalopolis. God is certainly gone - the place is entirely staffed by workaholic demons - and nuclear winter whistles forever through limitless wastelands at the bottom of the pit. </p> <p>The only problem with Hitler would be precisely where to lodge him - which chamber within which level within which circle of hell. The Inferno is so prodigious and of such mathematical complexity that hundreds of artists, from the renaissance to Blake, Rodin, Dali and Rauschenberg, have illustrated the poem without even beginning to exhaust its vision. But none has been inspired to quite such obsession as Dante's fellow Florentine, Sandro Botticelli. </p> <p>Botticelli worked on his illustrations for The Divine Comedy for almost 20 years. He made 100 drawings, eight of which are lost. The other 92, which have been repeatedly mislaid and rediscovered since his death in 1510, are reunited for the first time at the Royal Academy in London. Botticelli starts exactly as he continues, with a chart of hell as it drills like a tornado down beneath the earth: tier upon tier of theatrical balconies from which tiny figures topple, descending to that everlasting winter - a semi-circle of icy blue, drawn with the precision of a geometry-set protractor. </p> <p>This is and remains precisely Dante's idea of hell. Botticelli follows the poet, who is, in turn, led by his imaginary Virgil, past gullies of boiling oil and seas of blood, through rocky ravines, down chasmic holes to perilous ledges and arctic steppes. </p> <p>In every circle, the punishment fits the crime - the proud are burdened with massive boulders, the jealous have their eyes sewn shut, the corrupt are sluiced through cauldrons of filthy pitch. </p> <p>Dante and Virgil fall into conversation with the locals on their tour. One burning soul, drawn as a skein of wriggling lines like a forkful of spaghetti, pops up to get the news from back home. In a field of flailing legs - wicked clergymen planted head-down in the earth - Dante takes the opportunity to deliver a retaliatory sermon to his captive audience, Pope Nicholas III. </p> <p>The demons down tools for a chat. In Canto XXI, Virgil tries to get a backstage pass from Evil Claws, manager of the Eighth Circle devils. Botticelli brilliantly caricatures this pompous jobsworth with his pitchfork, flattered to be consulted but still intent on bureaucratic obstruction. Eventually, the tourists come upon Lucifer, a shaggy beast with bad teeth and three heads, cramming a trio of traitors - Judas, Brutus and Cassius - into his respective mouths. Naturally, the figure is based on Dante, but only to the letter. Botticelli makes an absurd cartoon out of the poet's vision of immortal terror. </p> <p>Call me a Calvinist, but there is nothing in Botticelli's demonology to strike the mind with fear. His devils are a menagerie of goats, centaurs, trolls and bearded gonks, more Disney or Palitoy than Hieronymus Bosch. If Botticelli ever dreamed of torment, his nightmares never inflected these drawings. Damnation is a diagram, in which thousands of tiny figures are detailed to enact agony. </p> <p>Each face has individual features, as commentators routinely observe. But true feeling is only reflected in Dante's changing expression as he descends through hell - compassionate, shocked, fearful, exhausted. </p> <p>What impresses most is what underpins all of Botticelli's art, which is his pure, curvaceous, powerful line. You will never have a better chance to see this, at its very source, than in these illustrations, incised in the parchment with silver- point, like feint pencil, or drawn with a fine stylus in iron-gall ink. So deft, so fast, so razor-sharp, his line skims across the surface - three undulating lines for a river; chins surfacing as quick curves in the tide; flames darting from tortured feet in spiralling whorls; a staircase opening in a rock-face as a dizzying zigzag of acute angles. </p> <p>Botticelli's pen always reverts to the curve, making curls of toes, hair, tails, wings, even of excrement and devilish forks. He will fill a whole sheet with battling demons or flights of angels and keep the proliferating curves steady with a few straight lines - angled spears or a level horizon. Some of these drawings would be remarkably hard to decipher if it weren't for this lucid geometry. </p> <p>Unlike his peers, Botticelli didn't make much use of perspective. Only by drawing an elliptical circle around a carpet of contorted bodies does he give any sense that they are trapped alive in a lake of ice, punished, in the poem, for imprisoning their guests. </p> <p>The devil is in the literary detail of this complex canto. Nobody knows quite why Botticelli persevered with these illustrations - as designs for frescoes, as a deluxe edition of The Divine Comedy, or simply for himself. Vasari says they 'caused infinite disorder in his life' and occasionally, as in the ice pond, there is a visible struggle between Botticelli's linear will and his compulsion to represent every detail of Dante's teeming vision with absolute fidelity. The drawings for the Inferno rarely equal the haunting power of Dante's poem, from its confessional opening - 'Midway along the journey of our life/ I woke to find myself in a dark wood/ for I had wandered far from the straight road.' </p> <p>But something marvellous happens in the illustrations for 'Paradiso', where the air clears, the crowds vanish and Dante finally meets his beloved Beatrice. The two figures are exquisitely contrasted: Beatrice, with her flowing hair and curvaceous femininity - Botticelli's Venus reprised but animated - and Dante, virile, hieratic and seductively graphic. The last dozen drawings simply represent their dialogue, tender, wry, gently reproachful, as Beatrice takes him up through the planets to explain the mysteries of God's universe. </p> <p>As Dante's field of vision expands, the figures get bigger and the sense of speed increases. The Moon and stars slip past as perfect circles, beside or behind them. Composition is all - two bodies in rest and motion against the pale space of the page. </p> <p>All of Botticelli's imagination and draughtsmanship are concentrated in the final, immemorial image - a vision Dante declared unimaginable - the holy family floating in the extreme distance, a tiny constellation transfigured in light.</p>",

Not that the crowd who gathered to mark the opening of the Royal Academy of Music's fifteenth International Composer Festival were in the slightest respect sleepy. They came anticipating the subversive fabrications of <b> Mauricio Kagel</b>, the 70-year-old Argentine composer who was the subject of this year's event and was a smiling presence at the occasion. His entire career has been based on musical insurrection, as serious in intent as it is bizarre and humorous in execution. Always respectful of musical tradition, his joyful delight in parody and contradiction puts him in a class of his own. How many composers can be said to have earned their reputation from an ability to make an audience chuckle? </p> <p>Every piece in his enormous output, usually written for a strikingly odd combination of instruments, has the compressed energy of a mini sitcom, brought to explosive life by the extraordinary versatility of the musicians who perform his work. Conventional virtuosity on a chosen instrument is not enough. Each player has to turn himself or herself into a dramatic character, as if out of Beckett or Pirandello. At the start of Rrrrrr_ Vier Soli f\u00fcr Stimme mit Begleitung - from a group of 41 pieces all with titles beginning with the letter R - Cari Burdett, a sultry mezzo-soprano, appeared on stage as bobble-hatted revolutionary chanting slogans in the thick accent of an all-purpose dissident. She transformed herself variously into slinky chanteuse and Afro-American railroad worker, accompanied by laid-back piano and laconic tuba. What was it all about? Kagel's gift is to make you put that question to the back of your mind and simply to accept what you see and hear. In a sense, he flatters the listener. Through this challenge to our own conventional expectations, we feel ourselves to be creatively interesting and as imaginatively untrammelled as the composer himself. </p> <p> Atem (Breath) for a wind player (1969/1970) was supposedly inspired by Kagel's neighbour, a retired wind player who spent his days making new reeds for colleagues, always playing the same sequence of notes to check for quality. With only a solo trumpeter on stage, Kagel makes brilliant play of the musician opening drawers, dismantling the instrument, oiling the keys, drying off residual saliva and talking to himself. He never plays a note of music. At the climax, after educing a squawking, plaintive melody from a plastic tube and grunting in counterpoint to himself, the soloist plunges his trumpet into a bucket of water. After a few flabby-lipped burbs and gurgles, he blows the residue over the audience in gentle aspersion then keels over on to the floor, 'seemingly dead, awaiting for the hoped-for retirement', as Kagel puts it. Valentin Garvie was the resourceful trumpeter. On the evidence of this performance, he has many career options ahead of him. </p> <p>One might be to team up with <b> Evelyn Glennie</b> who achieved comparable varieties of sound and invention in the first of three evenings of new works at the Wigmore Hall. Always a mesmerising performer, her face obscured by auburn curls, she bobbed in bare feet from marimba to bass drum to less nameable objects waiting to be struck. The players who joined her were every bit her match, including another (and somewhat more famous) trumpeter, Hakan Hardenberger, trombonist Christian Lindberg and the tuba player Oren Marshall, a droll figure who seems to have learnt his performance skills playing Kagel. </p> <p>In a programme note, Glennie announced: 'These concerts are not for critics. They are simply a celebration and the audience is almost eavesdropping on this informal music-making.' She has a point. Many of the collaborations involved improvisation, together or alone. In Nebojsa Jovan Zivkovic's Born to Beat Wild Op 30, part notated, part improvised, Hardenberger and Glennie, kneeling on the floor playing a big drum, began with a whisper and ended with ear-splitting frenzy. She hammered out the Balkan rhythms so forcefully one feared for her hands as she slapped them down on the vellum. Dave Heath's persuasive Darkness of Light, for Glennie and pianist Philip Smith, followed a similar climactic path, using the piano as a percussion instrument which unexpectedly evolves into an ethereal jazz mood. The last concert in the series is this afternoon. </p> <p>If Glennie and friends poured their energies into sound colour and atmosphere, <b> David Matthews</b>'s new piece for the English Chamber Orchestra put the emphasis squarely on harmony and melody. His Aubade Op 83, scored with characteristic subtlety for string orchestra with oboe, cor anglais and two horns, draws on Australian bird song for its wistful, melodic impetus. The hushed string textures and luscious cello solo had a diaphanous charm which suited the ECO players. In a provocative, if narrowly focused new collection of essays on the state of contemporary music ( Reviving the Muse: Essays on Music After Modernism edited by Peter Davison), Matthews states his belief that tonality is 'not outmoded, but a living force' and that the great forms of the past, such as the symphony, are still valid. On paper that may not sound exciting. Yet Matthews, in his way, is just as subversive as Kagel, even if his voice is quieter. When the composer is as persuasive as either of these, theories (which in any case tend to follow the music they claim to prescribe) don't much matter.</p>",

With only a solo trumpeter on stage, Kagel makes brilliant play of the musician opening drawers, dismantling the instrument, oiling the keys, drying off residual saliva and talking to himself. He never plays a note of music. At the climax, after educing a squawking, plaintive melody from a plastic tube and grunting in counterpoint to himself, the soloist plunges his trumpet into a bucket of water. After a few flabby-lipped burbs and gurgles, he blows the residue over the audience in gentle aspersion then keels over on to the floor, 'seemingly dead, awaiting for the hoped-for retirement', as Kagel puts it. Valentin Garvie was the resourceful trumpeter. On the evidence of this performance, he has many career options ahead of him. One might be to team up with Evelyn Glennie who achieved comparable varieties of sound and invention in the first of three evenings of new works at the Wigmore Hall. Always a mesmerising performer, her face obscured by auburn curls, she bobbed in bare feet from marimba to bass drum to less nameable objects waiting to be struck. The players who joined her were every bit her match, including another (and somewhat more famous) trumpeter, Hakan Hardenberger, trombonist Christian Lindberg and the tuba player Oren Marshall, a droll figure who seems to have learnt his performance skills playing Kagel. In a programme note, Glennie announced: 'These concerts are not for critics. They are simply a celebration and the audience is almost eavesdropping on this informal music-making.' She has a point. Many of the collaborations involved improvisation, together or alone. In Nebojsa Jovan Zivkovic's Born to Beat Wild Op 30, part notated, part improvised, Hardenberger and Glennie, kneeling on the floor playing a big drum, began with a whisper and ended with ear-splitting frenzy. She hammered out the Balkan rhythms so forcefully one feared for her hands as she slapped them down on the vellum. Dave Heath's persuasive Darkness of Light, for Glennie and pianist Philip Smith, followed a similar climactic path, using the piano as a percussion instrument which unexpectedly evolves into an ethereal jazz mood. The last concert in the series is this afternoon. If Glennie and friends poured their energies into sound colour and atmosphere, David Matthews's new piece for the English Chamber Orchestra put the emphasis squarely on harmony and melody. His Aubade Op 83, scored with characteristic subtlety for string orchestra with oboe, cor anglais and two horns, draws on Australian bird song for its wistful, melodic impetus. The hushed string textures and luscious cello solo had a diaphanous charm which suited the ECO players. In a provocative, if narrowly focused new collection of essays on the state of contemporary music ( Reviving the Muse: Essays on Music After Modernism edited by Peter Davison), Matthews states his belief that tonality is 'not outmoded, but a living force' and that the great forms of the past, such as the symphony, are still valid. On paper that may not sound exciting. Yet Matthews, in his way, is just as subversive as Kagel, even if his voice is quieter. When the composer is as persuasive as either of these, theories (which in any case tend to follow the music they claim to prescribe) don't much matter.",

      "body": "<p>The ground-breaking announcement last week by Bristol-Myers Squibb that it will cut the price of its Aids drugs in Africa from $20 a day to a below-cost price of less than $1 was an act of philanthropy - and good PR in a media climate that has turned sharply against the global drugs giants. </p> <p>But Bristol-Myers Squibb's move, which will transform its products from a niche market to a need market for the millions of people who could never have afforded them before, highlights the way in which forward-thinking multinational companies (MNCs) are now targeting the 4 billion people, two-thirds of the Earth's population, who have until now been written off in terms of market potential. </p> <p>Stuart Hart, director of the Sustainable Enterprise Initiative at the University of North Carolina, says it is not surprising that companies have traditionally overlooked the rural poor - what he calls the 'bottom of the pyramid' - as a fertile market. 'The bottom of the pyramid is chaotic and almost totally lacking in infrastructure. Not only that, to buy products and services - one must have money - and these people have little.' He defines the bottom of the pyramid as people with per capita incomes of less than $1,500 a year. </p> <p>But companies are beginning to dip their toes into these turbid waters. Shell Solar, in a joint venture with South Africa's national power company, Eskom, is bringing affordable solar power to the impoverished and isolated communities of the Eastern Cape for the first time, and with it the first social development many of them have ever experienced. But this is a strictly for-profit business. Shell Solar also operates in Sri Lanka, India, and the Philippines, and has ambitions to break into the mass markets of China and Indonesia. </p> <p>Dupont, Unilever, Hewlett-Packard and Johnson &amp; Johnson have also recently been experimenting with rural poor markets. Hart predicts that in five years' time this toe-dipping will develop into a substantial element of companies' global strategy. </p> <p>'It's clear to many multinationals that if they are to grow and prosper in the future there isn't growth potential at the top of the pyramid,' he said in an interview. 'It's also increasingly evident, as a result of the pushback against globalisation, that the traditional business model won't be acceptable in the future.' </p> <p>Unlike with newly industrialising markets such as Malaysia or Thailand, where MNCs could make small adjustments to the business models they use in Europe or North America before jumping in with both feet, reaching the rural poor involves throwing out the rulebook and rewriting it on the ground - often in close partnership with local companies or non-governmental organisations. </p> <p>The MNC furthest along this track is Unilever which, under the chairmanship of Niall FitzGerald, has espoused a multi-local, multinational approach across all its operations. Nowhere has this worked more successfully than in India, where its subsidiary Hindustan Lever is, as FitzGerald says, 'totally integrated into Indian society and dedicated to meeting the specific needs of millions of Indian consumers'. </p> <p>It wasn't always thus. For 50 years, like most multinationals in India, Hindustan Lever catered to India's elite. But when a low-end local company, Nirma, began to threaten Hindustan Lever's detergents business from below, it had to drastically rewrite its business plan. </p> <p>In order to offer a cheaper product, in small individual packaging, through the thousand tiny outlets where poor people shop, it had to decentralise its production, marketing and distribution to take advantage of India's abundant labour pool and change its cost structure. Its margins were lower, but this was more than compensated for by soaring unit sales. </p> <p>For a rupee or two, Indians can now buy shampoo in single sachets, handcream in pots the size of a thimble and toothpaste in small disposable sachets. Single rupee sachets comprise about 70 per cent of the company's shampoo sales. </p> <p>It's a business model that Unilever was able to replicate when the Asian economic crisis brought hardship to the newly industrialising south-east Asian countries. 'When South East Asia was hitting economic difficulties, we were able to adapt by tailor-making smaller-quantity products for those markets, says a Unilever spokesman. 'We came out the other side of the crisis stronger.' </p> <p>One of the reasons why the very poor are becoming a market is that more and more now have access to credit. Microcredit, the lending by banks of tiny sums to the poor, is catching on all over the world, particularly in the sub-continent. An estimated 2 million families in India have access to financial services, and the Indian government has pledged to reach 25 million families by 2005. </p> <p>In Bangladesh, Grameen Bank, the oldest and most successful microcredit institution, with 2.5 million borrowers, has spun off into a host of other enterprises providing services to the poor, including GrameenPhone, which is 51 per cent owned by Telenor Invest AS of Norway and aims to finance a network of mobile phones in 68,000 rural villages. </p> <p>Damien Miller, Shell Solar's business manager for India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, says partnership with a micro-credit organisation is a prerequisite to entering a market, for it is only through credit that someone earning $1,000-$2,000 a year can afford the $500 energy system. 'There has to be capacity to pay. You can get to a lot of paddy farmers who can give a down payment of 20 per cent and pay the rest over five years.' </p> <p>But isn't there a risk of people taking on debt they cannot sustain? In Sri Lanka, he says, the repayment rate is 95 per cent. More importantly, solar panels are a good investment for customers, who would otherwise use kerosene or rechargeable batteries for electricity. Economic payback ranges from two to five years - compared with a 20-year payback in countries such as the Netherlands and Germany, where solar energy remains a niche market. </p> <p>'There [in the West] they are doing it for environmental reasons,' says Miller. 'In developing countries it's a need market. They really need your product.' </p> <p>But not all companies operate so responsibly. One has only to look at Nestl\u00e9, which pedalled its dried baby milk formula to Third World mothers who had no access to clean drinking water as the 'healthy' alternative to breast milk, to see what harm can be done by irresponsible corporate behaviour. Hart acknowledges the risk of exploitation, but says that with the rise of the internet and the global power of pressure groups, companies won't get away with socially irresponsible behaviour for long. </p> <p>'I'm sure there will be plenty of mistakes, but I'm also confident they'll be ferreted out quickly. Increasingly we live in a fishbowl.' </p> <p>Hart instead sees the developing world as an incubator for sustainable technologies of the future - providing an early market 'pull' for ideas that will one day replace entrenched but ultimately unsustainable technologies in Europe and North America, such as fossil fuels. He points to micropower technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines and solar power, which have found early markets in places such as India.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Every 7.5 seconds, someone in the United States reaches the age of 50. This was one of the facts used by Prudential chief executive Jonathan Bloomer to explain the lure of American General, the US life assurer it is acquiring in a \u00a315.3 billion deal. </p> <p>If every 50-year-old bought an American General investment product, the City might start to think it was a good deal. For now, however, the attitude is sceptical at best; downright critical at worst. </p> <p>It is easy to see why. Price, timing, strategic rationale - on virtually any criterion, investors tick the 'no' box. </p> <p>The US economy is deteriorating rapidly. No one can predict how much further it will fall, nor how it will affect American General's savings and investments business. </p> <p>All the more surprising, then, that Prudential agreed to pay a chunky 18 per cent premium over the highest price ever reached by American General's shares (although the collapse in the Pru's own shares over last week eliminated the premium completely). </p> <p>That American General looks like an expensive expansion in the US at a risky time is bad enough. Much worse, however, is what the deal says about the rest of the business. Bloomer's key justification for the acquisition is the American firm's cash. </p> <p>Its businesses generate lots, but it has failed to find opportunities to re-invest it for a decent return. Instead, it has been passing it back to shareholders - $450 million last year alone. That cash, said Bloomer, would be needed to fund the Prudential's expansion in its fast-growing Asian business. </p> <p>'Especially with Japan, India and China coming on stream we could see the risk that, as a group, we would not generate enough cash and capital assets ourselves to invest flat-out in Asia and seize the opportunities.' </p> <p>That was the biggest shock to the City. Just four months ago, when the Pru took analysts to visit its Asian operations, 'the implication was that they could fund the growth internally', says Roger Doig, insurance analyst at JP Morgan. Now, it is clear that was wrong - and hell hath no fury like an analyst who feels he was misled. </p> <p>Since the deal was announced Bloomer has been holding meetings with shareholders. He says he is managing to persuade them of the wisdom of it. 'We expected the share price to fall because it was a surprise - there was no leak and because shareholders will not immediately know American General and what a quality business it is,' said Bloomer. </p> <p>American General certainly looks like quality. Its earnings have grown by an average of 14 per cent over the last five years; revenues and deposits by 16 per cent. It is the leading seller of fixed annuities and second-largest issuer of life policies in the US. Its sales are mainly through the workplace - primarily public sector employers. That fits well with Jackson National Life, the Pru's existing US operation, which sells mainly through broker-dealers and financial advisers. </p> <p>Bloomer is promising \u00a385m of cost savings from putting the two businesses together. Much more important, he says, is the prospect of boosting sales by distributing Jackson's products through American General's sales channels and vice versa. That, he says, means suggestions that he has overpaid are wrong. 'If you look at it on a discounted cash flow basis, with conservative-based growth assumptions, I canget to what we paid for it, no bother', he says. </p> <p>Others are less sure. JP Morgan's Doig doubts there will be many synergies. 'Jackson's main products are single premium, sold through broker-dealers - effectively stock market representatives. You can't put Jackson products through the distribution channels of American General - they are not qualified to sell them.' </p> <p>The new Prudential will be heavily exposed to the US - 57 per cent of its new business will be generated there, up from 27 per cent now.

      "bodyText": "Every 7.5 seconds, someone in the United States reaches the age of 50. This was one of the facts used by Prudential chief executive Jonathan Bloomer to explain the lure of American General, the US life assurer it is acquiring in a \u00a315.3 billion deal. If every 50-year-old bought an American General investment product, the City might start to think it was a good deal. For now, however, the attitude is sceptical at best; downright critical at worst. It is easy to see why. Price, timing, strategic rationale - on virtually any criterion, investors tick the 'no' box. The US economy is deteriorating rapidly. No one can predict how much further it will fall, nor how it will affect American General's savings and investments business. All the more surprising, then, that Prudential agreed to pay a chunky 18 per cent premium over the highest price ever reached by American General's shares (although the collapse in the Pru's own shares over last week eliminated the premium completely). That American General looks like an expensive expansion in the US at a risky time is bad enough. Much worse, however, is what the deal says about the rest of the business. Bloomer's key justification for the acquisition is the American firm's cash. Its businesses generate lots, but it has failed to find opportunities to re-invest it for a decent return. Instead, it has been passing it back to shareholders - $450 million last year alone. That cash, said Bloomer, would be needed to fund the Prudential's expansion in its fast-growing Asian business. 'Especially with Japan, India and China coming on stream we could see the risk that, as a group, we would not generate enough cash and capital assets ourselves to invest flat-out in Asia and seize the opportunities.' That was the biggest shock to the City. Just four months ago, when the Pru took analysts to visit its Asian operations, 'the implication was that they could fund the growth internally', says Roger Doig, insurance analyst at JP Morgan. Now, it is clear that was wrong - and hell hath no fury like an analyst who feels he was misled. Since the deal was announced Bloomer has been holding meetings with shareholders. He says he is managing to persuade them of the wisdom of it. 'We expected the share price to fall because it was a surprise - there was no leak and because shareholders will not immediately know American General and what a quality business it is,' said Bloomer. American General certainly looks like quality. Its earnings have grown by an average of 14 per cent over the last five years; revenues and deposits by 16 per cent. It is the leading seller of fixed annuities and second-largest issuer of life policies in the US. Its sales are mainly through the workplace - primarily public sector employers. That fits well with Jackson National Life, the Pru's existing US operation, which sells mainly through broker-dealers and financial advisers. Bloomer is promising \u00a385m of cost savings from putting the two businesses together. Much more important, he says, is the prospect of boosting sales by distributing Jackson's products through American General's sales channels and vice versa. That, he says, means suggestions that he has overpaid are wrong. 'If you look at it on a discounted cash flow basis, with conservative-based growth assumptions, I canget to what we paid for it, no bother', he says. Others are less sure. JP Morgan's Doig doubts there will be many synergies. 'Jackson's main products are single premium, sold through broker-dealers - effectively stock market representatives. You can't put Jackson products through the distribution channels of American General - they are not qualified to sell them.' The new Prudential will be heavily exposed to the US - 57 per cent of its new business will be generated there, up from 27 per cent now. Investors would probably prefer not to increase their exposure to the US when markets are so uncertain. The acquisition also dramatically reduces the importance of the Asian business - the one that is most attractive to investors. So attractive does the City find Asia that it forgave the Pru another lacklustre performance in the UK because its Asian business was growing so fast. Last year, Asia contributed a quarter of Pru's new business and Robin Savage, insurance analyst at WestLB Panmure, had expected that to rise to 50 per cent by 2005. Following the acquisition, Asia will have fallen to just 15 per cent of new business. Bloomer is not putting any figure on how much will be invested in Asia - but he says that it has been putting '\u00a3200m, if not more, into the business most years'. He also has his eye on Europe, the one serious area of weakness in the Prudential's business, following the appointment of Mark Wood, former chief executive of Axa Sun Life &amp; Provincial to head the group's UK and European business. Here, too, however, he cannot put a figure on the requirements, although he 'cannot see an acquisition of any significance'. Bloomer admits expansion in Asia and Europe could have been financed through a rights issues - it is more than 15 years since the Pru raised money - to acquire Jackson. 'But it would not be a rights issue for one big acquisition. It would be difficult to come back regularly with a rolling rights issue.' While Jackson is acknowledged to be a good business, many analysts think the \u00a3670m acquisition of Scottish Amicable in 1997 was a bad deal. 'They bought a half-decent company to take them into the independent financial adviser market but did not retain the management. It now seems to have lost its way big-time,' said an analyst. The jury is still out on the acquisition of M&amp;G for \u00a31.9bn in 1999. Although Sir Peter Davis was then chief executive, Bloomer - then finance director - was seen as the brains behind it. Strategically, it made sense but M&amp;G's profits are still not big enough to justify that price. 'M&amp;G must begin to deliver returns,' said WestLB Panmure's Savage. 'The pressure to perform is building.' Bloomer sees acquiring American General as a similarly strategic deal. In the short term it will prove itself through cost synergies and raised revenue. Longer term, the issue will be whether the US earnings have been invested in high-growth areas. There is, however, another short-term issue. Following the deal, which is expected to be completed sometime in the third quarter, US shareholders will own 49.5 per cent of the group, up from 9 per cent now, yet it will lose its US listing. Many are expected to sell, piling more pressure on the shares. The Pru's US team is meeting investors to sell them the deal, and Bloomer will make the trip in April. He will have to be very persuasive. Train ride that created a giant American General traces its history to a stormy day in 1926, when businessman Gus Wortham and his old friend Judge James Elkins took a train through Texas from Houston to the state capital, Austin, writes Edward Helmore . In Austin, they registered a company that in the 75 years since has become one of America's largest providers of retirement services, life insurance and consumer loans. Exploiting an oil boom, the company grew in Texas through acquisitions and gradually extended throughout the US. Over the past two decades it has acquired more than 35 competitors and, like the other leading insurers, it has shifted its emphasis from life insurance to variable and fixed annuities as Americans have become more concerned about outliving their savings than leaving their families in economic straits. Today, American General is one of the US's biggest insurers, and among the leaders in each part of its business. In December 1999, its diversified financial services arms held assets of $115 billion and served 12 million customers. The merged Prudential and American General, which will continue to do business in the US as AG and Jackson National Life (an American firm bought earlier by Prudential), will become the biggest US seller of variable annuities and the fifth-largest seller of life insurance. At the same time, it will become the sixth-largest insurer in the world, moving into a new league with giants such as the American International Group, Axa of France and Allianz of Germany. This new deal will leave only two big American-owned life insurers, Lincoln National and John Hancock.",

      "bodyText": "The way the market has moved over the past year has an uncanny resemblance to the great bear market of 1973-74, when share prices halved over an 18-month period against the background of banking collapses and oil price shocks. Those who were in the market at the time remember vividly the gloom and despondency that settled over the City as share prices continued an almost daily slide, failing to react to increasingly desperate measures by the then Labour government in which Denis (now Lord) Healey was Chancellor. Brian Winterflood, who runs the Winterflood Securities share-trading division of Close Brothers, was a young trader with a leading broker throughout the period: 'My overwhelming memory is that, after the great shake-out and sell-off, there was nothing for anybody to do. 'Nobody was doing any business, no matter how low prices went. It was a wonder we didn't all get the sack. The standard joke in Christmas 1973 was that the broking firms were all offering partnerships or turkeys as a gift, and they ran out of turkeys. I remember somebody calculating that the whole of the Jaguar car company was worth the same as 50 of their cars, which shows how far prices had fallen. 'The Bank of England issued a statement saying it was not going bust. A lot of us took other jobs just to supplement our income. Some of my stockbroker mates ran stalls in Petticoat Lane and Portobello Road, and I opened an antique shop called Floods in the New King's Road. 'Trading was different then. There was a lot less credit around, so people were actually losing their assets - houses and cars were flogged to pay off trading losses. 'Apart from 1987, which was really just a correction, we've had a 20-year bull market. So it's hard for young traders to imagine what it was like when people just did not deal. Well, now they know. 'The fear is still the same now - the fear of getting laid off, but things are better managed. Greenspan does actually have a hands-on approach to the whole issue, Bush's tax-cutting plan may help the US turn the corner, and I can't see the rest of the world allowing Japan to go bust. 'But there is still that terrible loss of confidence and spiralling losses. It will still take a long time to get the courage to go back into the market.' Sell, sell, sell. A week of market madness Line of failures feared as telecoms boom hits gloom Japan needs another miracle to survive Charging bulls and bears with sore heads",

      "body": "<p>Back in October 1999 Ray Dutton thought he was about to become a very rich man. His telecoms company, iaxis, which called itself a 'pan-European network', was looking at a $2 billion flotation to fund further expansion. Dutton, with hubris which then typified the telecoms sector, boasted: 'If you can't make money in telecoms, you should be in an institution for the feeble-minded.' </p> <p>He now lives in Australia - as far away as possible from angry investors who backed his company only to see it collapse last September. There are question marks, too, over Telemonde, an iaxis offspring chaired by Kevin Maxwell. Its shares have crashed by 85 per cent over the past 12 months. </p> <p>Both companies are 'carrier's carriers'. They have no infrastructure; they just lease capacity from other telecoms firms and sell it on. </p> <p>That was the theory. Unfortunately for iaxis and Telemonde, many other firms had the same idea and piggy-backed on companies which owned networks. The result: overcapacity that drove the price of bandwidth down by 80 per cent in little under a year. </p> <p>The problems facing the carriers' market, which emerged towards the end of last year, were the first true signs that the telecoms bubble was not sustainable, despite predictions heralding an explosion in data traffic as the world embraced the knowledge economy. </p> <p>Too many players have spent too much money on trying to compete at a time when companies are reining back spending plans in anticipation of hard days ahead. So margins are taking a hammering, and the stellar growth predictions made only a few months ago now look increasingly shaky. Dutton's iaxis is likely to be the first in a long line of failures. </p> <p>Last Wednesday it was the turn of Cable &amp; Wireless to depress the sector. It issued a profits warning, blaming a sharp fall in the price of internet traffic. Some 4,000 jobs will go. Chief executive Graham Wallace described the price cuts as 'severe' and suggested that rival companies would soon admit similar problems. </p> <p>Earlier this month US giant WorldCom announced it was laying off 7 per cent of its workforce. Rival AT&amp;T, forced to cut its fourth-quarter dividend last year, is now looking at breaking itself up after its shares plummeted. The problems facing debt-laden BT - now valued at \u00a335 billion, half what it stood at less than a year ago - are becoming worse daily. </p> <p>Then there is the nightmare mobile phones sector. With the costs of launching a global 3G wireless internet service estimated at more than \u00a3150bn, the likes of Vodafone and Orange have seen their share prices slide due to fear that they overpaid. </p> <p>All this has made the money markets nervous. The banks have overstretched themselves, lending the sector a staggering $300bn. It is only a matter of time before a number of telecoms players default. Only last week ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's said it 'no longer considers it prudent to rule out the possibility that the operator Viatel [which is in the middle of building a pan-European state-of-the-art network and once enjoyed a huge following on Wall Street] may fall below the junk bond CCC+ rating'. </p> <p>Concerns over other possible defaults have driven investors away from the telecoms bonds market. As a result, spreads have widened dramatically, and telecom bonds offer average interest of 14 per cent, compared with around 6 per cent for a no-risk Government bond. </p> <p>'There are too many telecom companies and they're not all going to make a profit,' says Adrian Murray, analyst with broker Teather &amp; Greenwood. 'The financial markets are no longer willing to increase their exposure.' </p> <p>The problems facing some network operators have in turn started to cut dramatically into the profits of makers of telecoms infrastructures. As their clients have faced a cash crunch, the equipment manufacturers - the very stocks analysts saw as 'safe harbours' because they provided the picks and shovels for the internet gold rush - are suffering. </p> <p>Why? Because when there is no way of raising new financing, smaller clients simply can't afford capital expenditure. Instead they must use what they've got. 'They can't keep building the networks,' Murray says. 'Every dollar those companies spend now must earn a return. They can't hope it comes in in three or four years.' </p> <p>Significantly, on the same day as Cable &amp; Wireless was announcing redundancies, Germany's Siemens and Motorola of the US added to the gloom, chipping in with, respectively, a profits warning and news of more job cuts. </p> <p>This came in the same week that Swedish mobile phone giant Ericsson, which makes the bulk of its revenues from building network infrastructure, announced it expected a first-quarter loss of up to \u00a3350m. Rival Nokia later put out a trading statement showing it expected sales growth to slump this quarter. </p> <p>Earlier this month network equipment giant Cisco said it would make 2,500 staff redundant, 5 per cent of its workforce. On the same day bellwether stock Intel, whose chips are found in everything from internet servers to mobile phones, issued its third profits warning in a row and announced that 5,000 jobs were to go. </p> <p>Gloom outside the telecoms sector hasn't helped. Cisco, for example, says the motor industry has cut around $100m of investment in telecoms. And as more dotcoms fail, demand for faster, fatter 'pipes' evaporates. </p> <p>No company is immune. Canadian giant Nortel, the world's largest telecoms equipment maker, stunned the market last October with disappointing sales figures, sending shockwaves through the infrastructure sector. </p> <p>Bookham Technology, the UK maker of fibre-optic cables and one of Nortel's biggest suppliers, has seen its shares slump as a result. Earlier this month it announced 150 redundancies. </p> <p>Where will it end? 'The bottom of the market will probably be marked when you see a relatively large telecom company go bust because the banks say they're not going to refinance it,' Murray says. </p> <p>With the Nasdaq now below 2,000 points, compared with a high of 5,000 last year, the markets' love affair with telecoms stocks, which powered the rise of the IT sector, is clearly over. </p> <p>Charles Dumas, analyst with Lombard Street Research, who predicted last the Nasdaq's slide last May, is now warning it could fall by a further 50 per cent. 'The tech sector is at best ex-growth, and much of it merely a profit-less call option on a bust,' Dumas says. </p> <p>So that's that.

'Historically, when bubbles burst, the trauma is felt for a very long time. It is deleterious for economic and stock market activity,' Dye told The Observer . </p> <p>'The headwinds are now very strong indeed. It's sad, really, that so many people believed they were cleverer than previous generations and could get so rich, so quick. Everyone is still expecting the good fairy to come along and wave her magic wand, but she won't.' </p> <p>That things are now very different is plain. In 1998, it was strong US economic growth that powered world markets out of crisis, ably assisted by Greenspan's nudging. Now the decade-long US economic miracle, the longest since records began, is undeniably slowing. At a projected 2.5 per cent this first quarter, growth in US consumer spending will be half the level of last summer. </p> <p>Last week, too, Washington announced a record deficit on its current account balance of trade: imports exceeded exports by a staggering $435bn last year, up from $331bn in 1999. As US demand is nearly half the world total, the worries over the global knock-on effects of a full-blown US recession are understandable. </p> <p>'This is a country living beyond its means. The plunge in US confidence is a sign of real problems ahead,' said leading economist Roger Bootle of consultants Capital Economics. 'Interest rate cuts will help, but if the fundamentals are wrong and asset prices are at the wrong levels, a few points off aren't going to help that much at all.' </p> <p>Dissect the data, however, and perhaps Greenspan has room to conjure after all. First, figures over the last fortnight show the US economy performing more robustly than expected, even though manufacturing output has now dipped for five months in a row. Employment and inflation are steady, new housing starts are holding up and retail sales are still respectably strong. That, indeed, was what George was trying to say last Monday. </p> <p>Second, it is the 'new economy' that is bearing the brunt of what looks like a traditional business cycle, as US firms cut back on hi tech investment. According to one forecast, this was running at $560bn last year - 5.5 per cent of GDP, against 3 per cent a decade ago - and may take another 10 years to regain that level. As the dotcom threat has petered out, such investment is now inessential and deferrable - bad news for the Ciscos, but not necessarily for their business clients. </p> <p>'To a great extent, right now the \"blood on the streets\" view is frankly unjustified. Valuations now are near their recession low points and so offer some comfort on a long term view,' said Richard Kersley, chief equity strategist at investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston. 'A catalyst is needed to turn things round and rate cuts won't be enough. What's needed is evidence that the rate medicine is working.' </p> <p>Yet there are clear - and present - dangers. Overall, the savings ratio in the free-spending US is now zero. Starved of capital gains if US consumers stop spending and start hoarding, the economy could be in for a very hard landing. A wave of job losses, for example, might spook consumer confidence. </p> <p>Despite the market crash over the last year, until recently money was still flowing into US equities. In January, a net $33.5bn was pumped into shares out of a record $140bn into markets as a whole. Worryingly, however, in February investors yanked $6.7bn from their savings with mutual funds, the first withdrawals since the crash of 1998. Half of US households hold shares - worth about $9 trillion in all - and the impact of a run on the funds would be cataclysmic. </p> <p>In 1998, however, it was a bolt from the blue - Russia's debt default - that caused the panic. It also prompted the collapse of LTCM, which itself threatened the stability of world financial markets until the US led a bail-out. </p> <p>In 2001, a similar spectre looms over Greenspan's Fed. Only now for Russia, read Japan - 'the bullet to our head' says CSFB's Kersley. </p> <p>The Japanese economy has been at rock-bottom for so long that, until Cisco, the markets had almost become inured to the potential for more problems. As the world's second-largest economy swings between economic and political crisis, tomorrow the Bank of Japan looks set to cut interest rates to zero in a final attempt to nudge the country out of paralysis. After further losses last week, Tokyo's Nikkei index stands at a 16-year low. With Japanese banks holding untold trillions of yen worth of shares as security and their financial year-end due on 31 March, the prospect of another banking crisis is greatly exercising regulators. </p> <p>Japan has been there and bailed out its banks before. But, with huge public debt, the Japanese government is itself barely solvent. </p> <p>'The most worrying thing is Japan,' said Bootle. 'You could envisage a scenario which is close to financial disaster. That's more or less unprecedented for a major developed country, despite all the crises we've been through in the last 20 or 30 years.' </p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,458356,00.html\">Line of failures feared as telecoms boom hits gloom</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,458359,00.html\">Japan needs another miracle to survive</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,458360,00.html\">Charging bulls and bears with sore heads</a><br><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,458355,00.html\">'Stockbrokers ran stalls on Petticoat Lane to make money'</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>'For the best part of a generation, talking about full employment has implied economic insanity. Getting back through 1 million marks the complete rehabilitation of full employment as a credible political and economic concept.' </p> <p>This remark, quoted in the Financial Times, was made by Paul Convery of the Unemployment Unit, a campaigning group that has done much to promote the cause of full employment. In the Eighties and Nineties, as some 30 or so revisions were made to the definition of unemployment - most aimed at lowering, or 'fiddling', the figures - the Unemployment Unit did sterling work in alerting people. </p> <p>Others who alerted people to what was going on included Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, former Tory Cabinet Minister Lord Gilmour and... I was going to say 'hosts of others' but we often felt like a beleaguered minority. </p> <p>It is good news that unemployment has fallen below the million mark, but disconcerting that unemployment is still around 1.5 million by the International Labour Organisation's definition of the economically active (5.2 per cent) against the 996,000 (3.4 per cent) indicated by the Government's figure for 'those out of work and claiming benefit'. </p> <p>The 996,000 figure leaves out those who would like to work but are disqualified for some reason from receiving benefits. Estimates of those people range from 3 million to 4 million - a statistic cited by the Prime Minister himself. </p> <p>I have not been slow to question a number of aspects of New Labour's economic strategy; but its restoration of the economically 'insane' goal of full employment is laudable. </p> <p>In the golden age of the Fifties and early Sixties, when unemployment was sometimes below 1 per cent, there were professors at Cambridge who implied that certain professors at the London School of Economics were almost fascists for advocating unemployment rates of 2.5 per cent to keep inflation down. </p> <p>Through their macro-economic policies, governments or central banks aim to run economies in a way that prevents an excessive degree of inflation. What counts as 'excessive' is debatable. But the main point is that there have been many times in the past when people were accused of being 'workshy' when it was government policy to create a situation where unemployment would rise. It was official, if undeclared, policy to make people workshy. </p> <p>One of the less attractive aspects of this Government's approach to employment is the element of compulsion about it. The fashion is to work yourself into the ground. Yet a civilised society ought to have room for people to exercise the right not to 'work' - especially if they have the full-time task of raising small children. </p> <p>A great irony of the present position is that the so-called 'culture of dependency' saw its strongest period of growth during the Thatcher era. To massage the size of unemployment figures that government policies were driving up, masses of people were actively encouraged to sign up as disabled. New Labour is living with the consequences. </p> <p>And I wonder whether it is wise of this Government to make so much of its New Deal policy that 'staying on benefits is not an option'. </p> <p>If the world economy turns sour in response to the US slowdown, a re-elected Labour Government may find that, for all its good intentions, the favourable unemployment trend will go into reverse, and unemployment could rise in a way which has nothing to do with being 'workshy'. </p> <p>In 1997 Gordon Brown inherited good macroeconomic policy conditions. Between them, he and the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee have kept up the trend towards full employment. But the outlook for the world economy seems to deteriorate daily. The news from the US is so disturbing that a Republican Party that wanted 'supply-side' tax reform to benefit the rich has now rediscovered Keynesian fiscal policy and is trying to sell its tax cut proposal as a demand-boosting measure. </p> <p>Very little of this tax cut seems to be aimed at the current year, and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts have so far done little to boost morale. A US boom that was allowed to get out of hand via inflated asset values is now in danger of leading to a bust via a reversal of that process. Economic forecasts in continental Europe are being revised downwards, but the European Central Bank remains complacent. </p> <p>It is not surprising that Gus O'Donnell, the Treasury representative on the MPC, has hinted he expects further rate cuts should the situation deteriorate. The Chancellor is to be congratulated for not bowing to pressure to lower the inflation target in his recent Budget. That would have restricted the MPC's room for manoeuvre, should the pound eventually start falling in response to our alarmingly large trade deficit. </p> <p>For the truth is that the main reason why the MPC has been undershooting the 2.5 per cent inflation target is the pound's ability - so far - to defy gravity. </p> <p>Why, there may even be an element of economic insanity in the market's high rating of the pound.</p>",

It is good news that unemployment has fallen below the million mark, but disconcerting that unemployment is still around 1.5 million by the International Labour Organisation's definition of the economically active (5.2 per cent) against the 996,000 (3.4 per cent) indicated by the Government's figure for 'those out of work and claiming benefit'. The 996,000 figure leaves out those who would like to work but are disqualified for some reason from receiving benefits. Estimates of those people range from 3 million to 4 million - a statistic cited by the Prime Minister himself. I have not been slow to question a number of aspects of New Labour's economic strategy; but its restoration of the economically 'insane' goal of full employment is laudable. In the golden age of the Fifties and early Sixties, when unemployment was sometimes below 1 per cent, there were professors at Cambridge who implied that certain professors at the London School of Economics were almost fascists for advocating unemployment rates of 2.5 per cent to keep inflation down. Through their macro-economic policies, governments or central banks aim to run economies in a way that prevents an excessive degree of inflation. What counts as 'excessive' is debatable. But the main point is that there have been many times in the past when people were accused of being 'workshy' when it was government policy to create a situation where unemployment would rise. It was official, if undeclared, policy to make people workshy. One of the less attractive aspects of this Government's approach to employment is the element of compulsion about it. The fashion is to work yourself into the ground. Yet a civilised society ought to have room for people to exercise the right not to 'work' - especially if they have the full-time task of raising small children. A great irony of the present position is that the so-called 'culture of dependency' saw its strongest period of growth during the Thatcher era. To massage the size of unemployment figures that government policies were driving up, masses of people were actively encouraged to sign up as disabled. New Labour is living with the consequences. And I wonder whether it is wise of this Government to make so much of its New Deal policy that 'staying on benefits is not an option'. If the world economy turns sour in response to the US slowdown, a re-elected Labour Government may find that, for all its good intentions, the favourable unemployment trend will go into reverse, and unemployment could rise in a way which has nothing to do with being 'workshy'. In 1997 Gordon Brown inherited good macroeconomic policy conditions. Between them, he and the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee have kept up the trend towards full employment. But the outlook for the world economy seems to deteriorate daily. The news from the US is so disturbing that a Republican Party that wanted 'supply-side' tax reform to benefit the rich has now rediscovered Keynesian fiscal policy and is trying to sell its tax cut proposal as a demand-boosting measure. Very little of this tax cut seems to be aimed at the current year, and the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts have so far done little to boost morale. A US boom that was allowed to get out of hand via inflated asset values is now in danger of leading to a bust via a reversal of that process. Economic forecasts in continental Europe are being revised downwards, but the European Central Bank remains complacent. It is not surprising that Gus O'Donnell, the Treasury representative on the MPC, has hinted he expects further rate cuts should the situation deteriorate. The Chancellor is to be congratulated for not bowing to pressure to lower the inflation target in his recent Budget. That would have restricted the MPC's room for manoeuvre, should the pound eventually start falling in response to our alarmingly large trade deficit. For the truth is that the main reason why the MPC has been undershooting the 2.5 per cent inflation target is the pound's ability - so far - to defy gravity. Why, there may even be an element of economic insanity in the market's high rating of the pound.",

      "bodyText": "BT's biggest shareholders will this week use the genteel surroundings of a City dining room to launch a putsch against the company's two most senior executives. At a dinner for key investors on Wednesday, leading institutions will tell chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield and chairman Sir Iain Vallance: quit or we won't stump up for a rights issue. Speculation has intensified in recent weeks that Bonfield and Vallance would have to go if City institutions were to subscribe for more shares, necessary to offset BT's spiralling debt problems. The institutions are angry the two men have failed to prevent a 60 per cent slide in BT's share price over the last 12 months. Insiders say the biggest shareholders now intend to use the dinner - which BT insiders describe as 'crucial'- to tell the company that it needs an urgent management overhaul. It was at a similar dinner earlier this year that BT first mooted the possibility of tapping investors for cash.

They are planning to have a second child soon. The only problem with their situation is that they are not particularly flush with money, and were therefore delighted when Eileen inherited \u00a39,000 from her great aunt just before Christmas. </p> <p>'We are extremely keen to use our windfall as wisely as possible,' says Eileen. 'We are wondering whether to invest the cash in something or whether to somehow use it to reduce our mortgage. Also, as a relatively full-time mother, I am not paying into a pension plan, but we don't know how to achieve this on our very limited income.' </p> <p>The money is in various Halifax accounts - \u00a33,000 in a mini-cash Isa, \u00a3500 in an equity Tracker Isa and the remainder in an instant access account. But Eileen is worried they may be tempted to spend it. They have already dipped into it to help pay for car repairs. </p> <p>Another reason Eileen wants to do something quite quickly is that she has recently discovered that they would qualify for the working families tax credit - if their savings were lower. </p> <p>Their mortgage is with NatWest. After taking out a discounted loan initially, they are now paying the standard variable rate. They would like to re-mortgage to get a cheaper deal but are locked into their loan until the end of August by redemption penalties.

They also want to move to a bigger house. </p> <p>Eileen wonders if she should put part of the lump sum into a pension policy. As she is not earning enough to pay National Insurance contributions, she wants to know whether she should pay them voluntarily to safeguard her state pension. </p> <p>Fortunately, Julius has a pension with his job and has also transferred bits of pension from previous jobs into his current scheme. He is also making additional voluntary contributions. Together with his pension, Julius has some life assurance. They also have life cover for the mortgage through the endowment. In fact, Eileen wonders if they have too much and could cut back to save money. </p> <p>Despite being 'very skint' as Eileen puts it, they have never had an overdraft and are not in debt apart from Julius's small student loan.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Gordon Wilson</strong></p> <p>Eileen and Julius should consider a remortgage in August to reduce their monthly interest costs. At this point I would also recommend reducing the debt with a large part of the \u00a39,000. As their income is stretched, debt reduction must be a priority. I would not advise a switch to a repayment mortgage as that would merely increase their outgoings. </p> <p>By remortgaging, there may be some spare income. Their first priority should be to look at how well protected the family is in the event of ill health or death. Julius should confirm how much life assurance he has at work but it is unlikely to be adequate. A cheap way of providing extra cover is a family income benefit pol icy. A policy that would pay \u00a310,000 a year would cost around \u00a316 a month.

This will help offset the higher monthly cost which will result if they switch to a repayment mortgage and maintain the endowment policy as a means of saving. </p> <p>Eileen could also consider putting some of the money into a stakeholder pension. They have been designed to help women who are taking career breaks to look after children. The advantage is that she can make contributions and receive tax relief even though she is a non-taxpayer. Up to \u00a33,600 per year can be contributed to a stakeholder pension either in a lump sum or by regular premiums.</p> <p>Once their savings are reduced to less than \u00a38,000, Eileen and Julius could then apply for the working families tax credit.

      "body": "<p>When it eventually takes place, the postponed Cheltenham Gold Cup meeting, the annual celebration of hoof and harness, will remain an event like no other, a three-day, hedonistic ritual that attracts more paying guests than any other in the realm save the British Grand Prix. </p> <p>Both are arenas of dreams, courage and, above all, excellence - something that rarely comes cheap, even when it concerns something as seemingly irrelevant as which horse will run fastest. </p> <p>What those who own racehorses - knaves, tycoons, royals or commoners - share is a seemingly ruinous price of entry. It can cost \u00a320,000 a year to have a horse in training, which is more than the fees payable at the country's finest places of learning. </p> <p>Before this, there's the cost of buying a horse worth training. Men with less sense than cunning have paid more than $13 million for horses that couldn't run faster than a donkey on speed. The bargain basement for yearlings - no horse begins its career until the age of two - starts at around \u00a35,000, and \u00a350,000 is not regarded as anything untoward. This buys the equivalent of an equine Mondeo, but with the possibility of transforming it into a Maserati. </p> <p>Few people in Britain make racing pay, unlike most other racing countries. The sport is taxed steeply by governments, which treat it like a playground of the rich. </p> <p>Increasingly, however, racing is attracting a new type of owner who belongs to a partnership or syndicate, and is there for the best reason: fun. Throwing money at keeping a slow horse in conditions and surroundings that few humans can match - the best of food, regular exercise, pampering from devoted servants, and much else - is not everyone's idea of entertainment. But collective ownership is now attracting people with more funds than they need who are willing to experience something a little different. </p> <p>Although the odds are stacked heavily against it, your co-owned horse could win races and repay the investment handsomely. What's more, the sale of media rights by the industry will go some way towards making ownership much less painful by improving the prize money. So if you fancy a go, where do you start? </p> <p>Many newcomers are drawn in by adverts in the trade press, largely the Racing Post . On Saturdays they offer shares in horses, mostly modest beasts. Most are placed by impoverished trainers who have horses looking for owners, and are probably best avoided. </p> <p>This is a self-regulating industry. You must know how to read the form in more ways than one. Spivvy horse dealers have been around since pre-history. </p> <p>The costs of shared ownership vary widely. They depend, among other things, on how many owners there are in the syndicate or partnership, and whether the agreement is for one season, two or, in rare cases, longer. The biggest cost is buying your horse. </p> <p>Some syndicate promoters inflate the purchase price before selling shares. Others offer the horse at cost, but take part of any profits when it is sold and the partnership dissolves. </p> <p>Three outfits you might want to consider are Highclere Thoroughbred Racing, Kennet Valley Thoroughbreds and Peter Harris Racing Stables. Highclere is seen as the 'posh people's syndicate' and has become the trade's high-roller. Kennet Valley, a tightly managed enterprise, prefers to race less expensive horses, while Peter Harris, an innovator in co-ownership, operates at the middle and lower end of the price spectrum. </p> <p>Highclere is managed by Harry Herbert, a son of Lord Carnarvon, the Queen's racing manager, and a stalwart of the turf. Unpretentious, engaging and hopelessly sentimental, Herbert has been spectacularly successful since his operation began in 1992. </p> <p>Syndicates under his direction have produced four champions, including a classic-winning filly, Petrushka. </p> <p>'Twenty per cent of our horses have made money,' says Herbert, 'and 45 per cent [of syndicate members] have got 50 per cent or more of their money back. Since 1993, we have managed 19 syndicates, and the average shareholder has paid \u00a311,800. The average return has been \u00a315,597. We operate at a level where it is easy to lose the lot. Hopefully, our success is assisted by the way we manage the horses.' </p> <p>Last year, Herbert ran eight syndicates varying from two 10-share groups at \u00a340,000 a share to a 20-share syndicate, where the cost per share was \u00a313,000. </p> <p>'My job is to make each shareholder feel that the horse is theirs,' he says. 'All contact is person-to-person, and we speak to owners whenever the horse is running, and even when it isn't. Multiple ownership doesn't mean you lose the personal touch.' </p> <p>Owners can travel to races on Highclere's leased aircraft. 'It is all about having fun,' says Herbert. </p> <p>While Herbert's background helps explain his choice of career, he learnt the basics from Nick Robinson, head of rival Kennet Valley. </p> <p>Unlike Highclere, but in common with most other firms offering multiple ownership, Kennet's shares are offered through partnerships rather than syndicates. With Government approval, partnerships allow VAT to be reclaimed, as long as each horse is 'sponsored'. Which explains why all Kennet horses bear the silks of the high-profile public relations firm Bell Pottinger. </p> <p>Robinson says it is 'crazy' to pay VAT if there is a way of avoiding it. Herbert responds that VAT can be reclaimed, albeit with strings, when a horse is sold. </p> <p>Robinson, an accomplished author and former editor of Pacemaker magazine, first ventured into multiple ownership in the Eighties with a wealthy gang that included Michael Smurfit, the Irish packaging millionaire. They bought four horses that would, they hoped, make the inaugural running for the Cartier Million in Ireland, the world's richest event for two-year-olds. Competing against 300 rivals, all four of Robinson's horses qualified to run, and two even made it into the money. The gamble paid off, and it was the inspiration for Kennet. </p> <p>It sold out of this year's offering of horses before Christmas. Four partnerships were filled, each with between 12 and 14 participants, at \u00a34,000 a share. Kennet's top-priced purchase at the autumn sales was \u00a340,000. </p> <p>'I do not believe in buying expensive horses,' says Robinson, most of whose 'partners' are knowledgeable about the turf. </p> <p>While not unsuccessful, Kennet has not enjoyed the high, and probably unsustainable, strike rate of Highclere, but one of its partnership horses, Gateman, has won valuable races in the United States and is heading for the Dubai World Cup meeting, the world's richest race, later this month. It may go on to compete in a $2m international race in Singapore. </p> <p>For participants in shared ownership, Gateman and Highclere's Petrushka represent the ultimate dream. </p> <p>Owners with Peter Harris, the horse trainer and caravan park operator who last year relieved the Rank Organisation of Butlins holiday camps, have also shared success at a high level, primarily through a colt, Primo Valentino, and a filly, Katy Nowaitee. Her owners include a welder, a publican, and a retired factory foreman. </p> <p>Harris, one of the first trainers to back multiple ownership, is now king of the partnerships. Three-quarters of the 120 horses in his yard are co-owned. </p> <p>'There isn't a stable in the land with such a high proportion,' says Simon Double, one of his managers. 'We look after 400 owners, all initially investing for two years.' </p> <p>Harris differs from most rivals in that investors do not have to pay a lump sum upfront. </p> <p>'We allow people to pay us monthly by standing order,' says Double. 'Our credit agreements are a bit like those for a car. It makes a big difference to most owners.' </p> <p>One enthusiast says there are few disadvantages to co-ownership , but adds: 'I think that a maximum of 10 partners is fine. Beyond that, you get further and further from the horse.' </p> <p>Good luck.</p>",

The sport is taxed steeply by governments, which treat it like a playground of the rich. Increasingly, however, racing is attracting a new type of owner who belongs to a partnership or syndicate, and is there for the best reason: fun. Throwing money at keeping a slow horse in conditions and surroundings that few humans can match - the best of food, regular exercise, pampering from devoted servants, and much else - is not everyone's idea of entertainment. But collective ownership is now attracting people with more funds than they need who are willing to experience something a little different. Although the odds are stacked heavily against it, your co-owned horse could win races and repay the investment handsomely. What's more, the sale of media rights by the industry will go some way towards making ownership much less painful by improving the prize money. So if you fancy a go, where do you start? Many newcomers are drawn in by adverts in the trade press, largely the Racing Post . On Saturdays they offer shares in horses, mostly modest beasts. Most are placed by impoverished trainers who have horses looking for owners, and are probably best avoided. This is a self-regulating industry. You must know how to read the form in more ways than one. Spivvy horse dealers have been around since pre-history. The costs of shared ownership vary widely. They depend, among other things, on how many owners there are in the syndicate or partnership, and whether the agreement is for one season, two or, in rare cases, longer. The biggest cost is buying your horse. Some syndicate promoters inflate the purchase price before selling shares. Others offer the horse at cost, but take part of any profits when it is sold and the partnership dissolves. Three outfits you might want to consider are Highclere Thoroughbred Racing, Kennet Valley Thoroughbreds and Peter Harris Racing Stables. Highclere is seen as the 'posh people's syndicate' and has become the trade's high-roller. Kennet Valley, a tightly managed enterprise, prefers to race less expensive horses, while Peter Harris, an innovator in co-ownership, operates at the middle and lower end of the price spectrum. Highclere is managed by Harry Herbert, a son of Lord Carnarvon, the Queen's racing manager, and a stalwart of the turf. Unpretentious, engaging and hopelessly sentimental, Herbert has been spectacularly successful since his operation began in 1992. Syndicates under his direction have produced four champions, including a classic-winning filly, Petrushka. 'Twenty per cent of our horses have made money,' says Herbert, 'and 45 per cent [of syndicate members] have got 50 per cent or more of their money back. Since 1993, we have managed 19 syndicates, and the average shareholder has paid \u00a311,800. The average return has been \u00a315,597. We operate at a level where it is easy to lose the lot. Hopefully, our success is assisted by the way we manage the horses.' Last year, Herbert ran eight syndicates varying from two 10-share groups at \u00a340,000 a share to a 20-share syndicate, where the cost per share was \u00a313,000. 'My job is to make each shareholder feel that the horse is theirs,' he says. 'All contact is person-to-person, and we speak to owners whenever the horse is running, and even when it isn't. Multiple ownership doesn't mean you lose the personal touch.' Owners can travel to races on Highclere's leased aircraft. 'It is all about having fun,' says Herbert. While Herbert's background helps explain his choice of career, he learnt the basics from Nick Robinson, head of rival Kennet Valley. Unlike Highclere, but in common with most other firms offering multiple ownership, Kennet's shares are offered through partnerships rather than syndicates. With Government approval, partnerships allow VAT to be reclaimed, as long as each horse is 'sponsored'. Which explains why all Kennet horses bear the silks of the high-profile public relations firm Bell Pottinger. Robinson says it is 'crazy' to pay VAT if there is a way of avoiding it. Herbert responds that VAT can be reclaimed, albeit with strings, when a horse is sold. Robinson, an accomplished author and former editor of Pacemaker magazine, first ventured into multiple ownership in the Eighties with a wealthy gang that included Michael Smurfit, the Irish packaging millionaire. They bought four horses that would, they hoped, make the inaugural running for the Cartier Million in Ireland, the world's richest event for two-year-olds. Competing against 300 rivals, all four of Robinson's horses qualified to run, and two even made it into the money. The gamble paid off, and it was the inspiration for Kennet. It sold out of this year's offering of horses before Christmas. Four partnerships were filled, each with between 12 and 14 participants, at \u00a34,000 a share. Kennet's top-priced purchase at the autumn sales was \u00a340,000. 'I do not believe in buying expensive horses,' says Robinson, most of whose 'partners' are knowledgeable about the turf. While not unsuccessful, Kennet has not enjoyed the high, and probably unsustainable, strike rate of Highclere, but one of its partnership horses, Gateman, has won valuable races in the United States and is heading for the Dubai World Cup meeting, the world's richest race, later this month. It may go on to compete in a $2m international race in Singapore. For participants in shared ownership, Gateman and Highclere's Petrushka represent the ultimate dream. Owners with Peter Harris, the horse trainer and caravan park operator who last year relieved the Rank Organisation of Butlins holiday camps, have also shared success at a high level, primarily through a colt, Primo Valentino, and a filly, Katy Nowaitee. Her owners include a welder, a publican, and a retired factory foreman. Harris, one of the first trainers to back multiple ownership, is now king of the partnerships. Three-quarters of the 120 horses in his yard are co-owned. 'There isn't a stable in the land with such a high proportion,' says Simon Double, one of his managers. 'We look after 400 owners, all initially investing for two years.' Harris differs from most rivals in that investors do not have to pay a lump sum upfront. 'We allow people to pay us monthly by standing order,' says Double. 'Our credit agreements are a bit like those for a car. It makes a big difference to most owners.' One enthusiast says there are few disadvantages to co-ownership , but adds: 'I think that a maximum of 10 partners is fine. Beyond that, you get further and further from the horse.' Good luck.",

      "body": "<b> Tortilla de Bacalao - salt cod tortilla</b> <p> The name of this famous Spanish omelette comes from the word torta , or tart. The main difference between Spanish and French omelettes is that Spanish ones are flat, whereas French ones are rolled. The former usually contain potatoes, too. </p> <p>Tortilla is eaten widely and often in Spain because of its versatility. It can be served hot or cold, in a sandwich or bocadillo, or as a quick tapa. There are countless variations on the basic tortilla, but one of the tastiest ones is made with salt cod. You could also use roasted red peppers, chopped spinach or, for a spring-vegetable tortilla, peas and broad beans. Recipe by Carlos Vargas . Serves 4-6. </p> <p><b>300g salt cod, soaked (see below) </b><br> <b>4 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b>4 large potatoes, peeled and sliced </b><br> <b>1 medium onion, sliced </b><br> <b>8 eggs, beaten </b><br> <b>a few sprigs of flat-leaf parsley, chopped </b><br> <b>salt </b></p> <p>Put the soaked salt cod in a large saucepan of simmering water and cook gently for 15-20 minutes, until the flesh is beginning to flake. Drain and leave to cool, discarding the skin and bones while it is still warm. Heat the oil in a large frying pan until smoking hot, add the potatoes and fry for a few minutes, until golden. Then add the onion and cook for 3 minutes, covering the pan (the condensation softens the potatoes and onion). Once the vegetables are cooked, take them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and mix with the beaten eggs and flaked salt cod. Add the parsley, and some salt if required. </p> <p>Pour out all but 3 tbsp of the oil from the frying pan and tip in the tortilla mixture, cooking it over a very low heat until it is set underneath and coming away from the sides of the pan. You may need to cover the pan to help cook the middle. To turn the tortilla, remove the pan from the heat, place a plate over it and turn the pan over so the tortilla is on the plate. Then slide the tortilla back into the pan and cook for 3 more minutes, uncovered. </p> <p><b> Soaking salted cod</b> </p> <p>A good fishmonger should stock salt cod, or be able to get it for you. You can also find it in delicatessens and some supermarkets. Buy salt cod that is as thick as possible, without any yellowing, which happens when it has been badly stored. Wash as much salt from the fish as you can and then soak it, skin side up, in plenty of cold water in the fridge for a day. Change the water 2 or 3 times during this period. Even better, and quicker, would be to have a constant flow of water running over the fish, although I admit this is hardly feasible in the average kitchen.

      "bodyText": "Tortilla de Bacalao - salt cod tortilla The name of this famous Spanish omelette comes from the word torta , or tart. The main difference between Spanish and French omelettes is that Spanish ones are flat, whereas French ones are rolled. The former usually contain potatoes, too. Tortilla is eaten widely and often in Spain because of its versatility. It can be served hot or cold, in a sandwich or bocadillo, or as a quick tapa. There are countless variations on the basic tortilla, but one of the tastiest ones is made with salt cod. You could also use roasted red peppers, chopped spinach or, for a spring-vegetable tortilla, peas and broad beans. Recipe by Carlos Vargas . Serves 4-6. 300g salt cod, soaked (see below) 4 tbsp olive oil 4 large potatoes, peeled and sliced 1 medium onion, sliced 8 eggs, beaten a few sprigs of flat-leaf parsley, chopped salt Put the soaked salt cod in a large saucepan of simmering water and cook gently for 15-20 minutes, until the flesh is beginning to flake. Drain and leave to cool, discarding the skin and bones while it is still warm. Heat the oil in a large frying pan until smoking hot, add the potatoes and fry for a few minutes, until golden. Then add the onion and cook for 3 minutes, covering the pan (the condensation softens the potatoes and onion). Once the vegetables are cooked, take them out of the pan with a slotted spoon and mix with the beaten eggs and flaked salt cod. Add the parsley, and some salt if required. Pour out all but 3 tbsp of the oil from the frying pan and tip in the tortilla mixture, cooking it over a very low heat until it is set underneath and coming away from the sides of the pan. You may need to cover the pan to help cook the middle. To turn the tortilla, remove the pan from the heat, place a plate over it and turn the pan over so the tortilla is on the plate. Then slide the tortilla back into the pan and cook for 3 more minutes, uncovered. Soaking salted cod A good fishmonger should stock salt cod, or be able to get it for you. You can also find it in delicatessens and some supermarkets. Buy salt cod that is as thick as possible, without any yellowing, which happens when it has been badly stored. Wash as much salt from the fish as you can and then soak it, skin side up, in plenty of cold water in the fridge for a day. Change the water 2 or 3 times during this period. Even better, and quicker, would be to have a constant flow of water running over the fish, although I admit this is hardly feasible in the average kitchen. The fish should not taste overly salty at the end of the soaking period; the only way to check it is to taste a bit.

      "body": "<p>'As you get older,' Nick Cave, aged 43, tells me, 'rock and roll has the potential to be a really embarrassing, even humiliating, way to make a living.' We are talking, inevitably, about age and maturity, about the seeming inability of most rock stars to grow old gracefully, about the need to either reinvent yourself or ossify when you reach an age when anger and angst no longer seem like viable responses to the world.</p> <p>'I really think the music I make now,' he continues, pausing to consider the connotations of what he is about to say, 'is adult music. There isn't any other word for it. And I really feel that the music I made when I was young is very different. It's a place I can't go back to, even if I wanted to, which I don't. I guess I just feel differently towards the world these days.' He adds, a rare fleeting smile lighting up his puckish features: 'I think it's called maturity.'</p> <p>Nearly 20 years ago, when I was younger and wilder, and Nick Cave was a whole lot younger and wilder, I would not have bet money that he would make it into his forties, never mind be making adult music, which despite his late blooming maturity still manages to be effortlessly out of step with pop's prevailing mood. Back then, Cave was, to say the least, an extremist, both creatively and recreationally. Time passes, though. Things change. Even the wildest performers must mellow as mid-life encroaches, or, like Shane MacGowan, they become caricatures of their former selves. </p> <p>Nick Cave, I am glad to report, has mellowed in the most salutary way: he seems focused, settled, still curious; his new music hums with what you might call a calmer intensity. He remains, though, a nervous to the point of twitchy interviewee. </p> <p>Most popular musicians, bar those for whom the making of music is secondary to the pursuit of fame (and there are an increasing number of them, of course), view promotion as a necessary chore, and approach the interview ritual with a palpable degree of reluctance. Some, like Van Morrison, transmute that reluctance into a kind of combative surliness; others, like REM's Michael Stipe, maintain a detached Zen cool that has to be decoded before any kind of truth emerges. Cave is different. Cave frets. Grave and taciturn at the best of times, his answers, always measured and meticulous, are often arrived at painfully slowly, and with a cautious attention to words that suggests he has been misconstrued to his cost in the past. He has a tendency, too, to punctuate his sentences with a short nervous laugh that is hardly a laugh at all, more an involuntary spasm, a release of tension. Throughout, he shifts uneasily in his seat as if uncomfortable in his own skin. 'I cannot imagine that anyone actually enjoys talking about themselves,' he mutters at one point, and when I tell him some do, he looks aghast. </p> <p>If his nervousness is palpable, and strangely contagious, he is simultaneously shy and gracious in an almost old-fashioned, unworldly way that befits a more reclusive calling, that of cleric or classical scholar, say, rather than a rock star. And though he has both spiritual and literary leanings (he recently wrote a trenchant introduction to The Gospel According to Mark for the Canongate mini-bibles series, has had two lectures released on CD, and published an acclaimed novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel in 1989 ), and would no doubt wince at the very term 'rock star', Cave is a rock star in the purest sense: a performer who has pursued his most primal urges, and unleashed, if not exorcised, his demons through often extreme performances and self-lacerating songs. A deadly serious and wilfully untypical rock star, then. </p> <p>His pursuit of the heavens via the gutter began in earnest when he first arrived in London from his native Melbourne in the early Eighties. The dominant themes of his songs were the destabilising effects of love and desire, the prison house of the flesh and the primacy of the soul or spirit. These days, following his marriage in 1999 to the aristocratic English model, Suzie Bick, only the latter two concerns still apply. She recently gave birth to twins, Earl and Arthur, and Cave also has an older son, Luke, aged 10, by a previous liaison with Brazilian art director, Viviane Carneiro. </p> <p>For a long while, though, Cave was rock's reigning melodramatist, a performer whose stock in trade was the articulation of misery, obsession and a particular strain of unnerving and occasionally liberating self-abjection. Back when the sleek and empty pop of Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet and the like was the soundtrack to the empty, self-serving Eighties, Cave was the rock performer as Nietzschean anti-hero, willing all manner of self-inflicted damage on his gangly, stick thin torso. Like Iggy Pop or John Lydon before him, he believed in the purity of extremes, in the pursuit of transcendence through excess. As lead singer of the Birthday Party - a bunch of like-minded fellow Australians, who remain the most implosively violent, and by today's standards impossibly dissolute rock group I have ever witnessed - he sang: 'I stuck a six-inch gold blade into the head of a girl,' and told an interviewer, 'Perhaps I'm emotionally retarded but I've just written about things how I felt them... things like revenge... there's something noble about revenge... something aesthetically pleasing about it.' </p> <p>Every Cave song was a protracted howl of anguish at the world, every performance a conscious acting-out of the maxim 'that which does not kill us, makes us stronger'. </p> <p>His offstage existence, too, was messy and volatile, an exile's survival course made all the more torturous by a burgeoning addiction to heroin, and a subsequent blurring of the already amorphous boundary between Cave's incendiary art and his life. Later, throughout the Nineties - as a strung out solo performer backed by an only slightly less dissolute and equally serious bunch of musicians known collectively as the Bad Seeds - he refined his subject matter and became a kind of bastard offspring of Antonin Artaud and Leonard Cohen. The cruelty and righteous anger of old was now tempered with a creeping melancholy that has remained a constant ever since. </p> <p>Then, having finally kicked heroin, his adopted persona as rock's reigning prodigal reached its illogical conclusion on an album called Murder Ballads, where he duetted with a colourful cast of foils that included the aforementioned MacGowan, the equally obsessive P. J. Harvey and, unlikeliest of all, erstwhile Australian soap star, Kylie Minogue. In the press his name was romantically linked with Minogue, who became a muse of sorts for a while, even inspiring a lecture, The Secret Life of the Love Song, delivered at the Royal Festival Hall. He had a short but tempestuous affair with Harvey, the breakdown of which was alluded to in some detail on the ensuing album, 1999's The Boatman's Call. </p> <p>On that record Cave executed one of the most startling turnarounds in recent pop history, suddenly reborn as a singer of slow, softly enunciated and often palpably spiritual love songs. As Simon Reynolds put it in his thought-provoking book Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock: 'The fireball had become an ember.' Where once he raged against the world on wilfully profane songs like 'Fingers Down The Throat of Love' and 'I'm Gonna Kill That Woman', now he sang of the peace that passeth understanding on compositions like; 'Lime Tree Arbour' and 'Into My Arms'. The latter song, sung to a stately piano accompaniment, evoked a mood of almost hymn-like serenity. As well as having the best and bravest opening line of any recent pop song - 'I don't believe in an interventionist God' - it suggested a profound sea-change had occurred, not just in Cave's subject matter and approach to music but in his way of looking at the world.</p> <p>It felt, in fact, like he had, literally and metaphorically, been born again. And, in a way, he had. 'All sorts of elements came together at that time,' he elaborates, running his long fingers through his mane of unruly black hair and lighting up the latest of many furiously smoked cigarettes, 'the main one being that I got married. I also made it past the 40 mark, and I'm always, erm, amused by that, if nothing else. Certainly for me, it was a cut-off point in some profound sense. Things fell into place.</p> <p>'Before that there was always this tremendous sense of panic, the feeling that every song I wrote was going to be the last. It was not, looking back, a particularly clever way to live.' The underlying causes of this all-pervasive sense of panic are detailed in 'The Secret Life of the Love Song' essay, where he writes: 'My artistic life has centred around an attempt to articulate an almost palpable sense of loss that laid claim to my life. A great gaping hole was blasted out of my world by the unexpected death of my father when I was 19 years old. The way I learned to fill this hole, this void, was to write.' </p> <p> The chaotic living, the drug- taking, and the violent but seldom cathartic live performances were, for a while anyway, another less focused symptom of this profound sense of loss. 'I don't regret all of that,' he says, matter-of-factly, 'absolutely not. I mean, I even had a good time for a while, and felt pretty good despite the way I looked. I was young and I didn't question things back then, I just barrelled along. What I do regret though is the time that I wasted. There was an awful lot of waiting around.'</p> <p>He pauses for longer than usual, as if he has already revealed too much of himself, then, tentatively, continues: 'Because of the way I was living, and because every day felt like the end of things, it felt like I was just fucking squeezing the toothpaste dry. All the time. Then suddenly I got to 40 and it just became clear that, if I followed certain guiding principles, and didn't do things for the wrong reasons, there was no reason why I could not just carry on. With that realisation came a certain calmness and freedom.' </p> <p> The new songs bear this out. They sound less frenetic than before but a slow-burning intensity and, at times, anxiety endures. You can hear it in places on the new album, No More Shall We Part, which is, intriguingly, a lot less calm and a whole lot less confessional than its predecessor. He is pleased that I have connected with this shift of emphasis. 'One thing I like about the songs on the new record, and don't like about The Boatman's Call, is that you don't have to know anything about the personal narrative that accompanies them. I find that confessional mode (he all but spits out the phrase) I slipped into back there incredibly difficult to listen to now. There is a school of thought that thinks the confessional is honest and courageous but I don't agree with that. I think it is the easiest way to write provided you are locked into a kind of masturbatory frame of mind, which I was back there. I mean, I was making a big heroic melodrama out of a bog-standard rejection by a woman.' </p> <p>According to their author, the songs on No More Shall We Part are 'the most straightforward and accurate reflection of the way I feel about things'. Many of them, including the beautifully pitched 'Love Letter', exude an almost luxurious melancholy; some, like 'Oh my Lord' and 'Hallelujah' are filled with the biblical language and imagery that has been his main stock in trade of late; one, the blackly humorous 'God Is In The House', written from the point of view of an American, small-town, God-fearing fundamentalist, even reveals a late flowering gift for social satire. </p> <p>All the songs were written over the past year in an newly acquired office near his west London home, where, he tells me proudly, he goes to work every day. Songwriting, then, has become a regular nine-to-five job, which is as telling a reflection of the new disciplined and rigorous Nick Cave as his heroin habit was of the unruly, uncentred Nick Cave of old. A man of extremes. In April Penguin will publish The Complete Lyrics of Nick Cave, a literary canonisation which has only previously been bestowed on a select few, most notably Bob Dylan, his long time musical hero. 'I had to sit down and plough through everything I had ever written from 1978 to now, in one day,' he grimaces. 'Page after page of this relentless writing which, on the page, was more amusing than anything. The early stuff was pretty ambitious for its time, but so depressing. It was like I felt I had to thrust everything down everybody's throat all the time to make sure they absolutely got the message.</p> <p>'That's a fearful way to make music,' he adds, ruefully. 'It takes its toll.' He has come through though. And I for one say Hallelujah to that. </p> <p>And No More Shall We Part is released on Mute on 2 April. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds begin a tour at The Olympia in Dublin on 28 April, culminating at Brixton Academy on 5 and 6 May. The Complete Lyrics of Nick Cave is published by Penguin Books on 26 April</p>",

We are talking, inevitably, about age and maturity, about the seeming inability of most rock stars to grow old gracefully, about the need to either reinvent yourself or ossify when you reach an age when anger and angst no longer seem like viable responses to the world. 'I really think the music I make now,' he continues, pausing to consider the connotations of what he is about to say, 'is adult music. There isn't any other word for it. And I really feel that the music I made when I was young is very different. It's a place I can't go back to, even if I wanted to, which I don't. I guess I just feel differently towards the world these days.' He adds, a rare fleeting smile lighting up his puckish features: 'I think it's called maturity.' Nearly 20 years ago, when I was younger and wilder, and Nick Cave was a whole lot younger and wilder, I would not have bet money that he would make it into his forties, never mind be making adult music, which despite his late blooming maturity still manages to be effortlessly out of step with pop's prevailing mood. Back then, Cave was, to say the least, an extremist, both creatively and recreationally. Time passes, though. Things change. Even the wildest performers must mellow as mid-life encroaches, or, like Shane MacGowan, they become caricatures of their former selves. Nick Cave, I am glad to report, has mellowed in the most salutary way: he seems focused, settled, still curious; his new music hums with what you might call a calmer intensity. He remains, though, a nervous to the point of twitchy interviewee. Most popular musicians, bar those for whom the making of music is secondary to the pursuit of fame (and there are an increasing number of them, of course), view promotion as a necessary chore, and approach the interview ritual with a palpable degree of reluctance. Some, like Van Morrison, transmute that reluctance into a kind of combative surliness; others, like REM's Michael Stipe, maintain a detached Zen cool that has to be decoded before any kind of truth emerges. Cave is different. Cave frets. Grave and taciturn at the best of times, his answers, always measured and meticulous, are often arrived at painfully slowly, and with a cautious attention to words that suggests he has been misconstrued to his cost in the past. He has a tendency, too, to punctuate his sentences with a short nervous laugh that is hardly a laugh at all, more an involuntary spasm, a release of tension. Throughout, he shifts uneasily in his seat as if uncomfortable in his own skin. 'I cannot imagine that anyone actually enjoys talking about themselves,' he mutters at one point, and when I tell him some do, he looks aghast. If his nervousness is palpable, and strangely contagious, he is simultaneously shy and gracious in an almost old-fashioned, unworldly way that befits a more reclusive calling, that of cleric or classical scholar, say, rather than a rock star. And though he has both spiritual and literary leanings (he recently wrote a trenchant introduction to The Gospel According to Mark for the Canongate mini-bibles series, has had two lectures released on CD, and published an acclaimed novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel in 1989 ), and would no doubt wince at the very term 'rock star', Cave is a rock star in the purest sense: a performer who has pursued his most primal urges, and unleashed, if not exorcised, his demons through often extreme performances and self-lacerating songs. A deadly serious and wilfully untypical rock star, then. His pursuit of the heavens via the gutter began in earnest when he first arrived in London from his native Melbourne in the early Eighties. The dominant themes of his songs were the destabilising effects of love and desire, the prison house of the flesh and the primacy of the soul or spirit. These days, following his marriage in 1999 to the aristocratic English model, Suzie Bick, only the latter two concerns still apply. She recently gave birth to twins, Earl and Arthur, and Cave also has an older son, Luke, aged 10, by a previous liaison with Brazilian art director, Viviane Carneiro. For a long while, though, Cave was rock's reigning melodramatist, a performer whose stock in trade was the articulation of misery, obsession and a particular strain of unnerving and occasionally liberating self-abjection. Back when the sleek and empty pop of Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet and the like was the soundtrack to the empty, self-serving Eighties, Cave was the rock performer as Nietzschean anti-hero, willing all manner of self-inflicted damage on his gangly, stick thin torso. Like Iggy Pop or John Lydon before him, he believed in the purity of extremes, in the pursuit of transcendence through excess. As lead singer of the Birthday Party - a bunch of like-minded fellow Australians, who remain the most implosively violent, and by today's standards impossibly dissolute rock group I have ever witnessed - he sang: 'I stuck a six-inch gold blade into the head of a girl,' and told an interviewer, 'Perhaps I'm emotionally retarded but I've just written about things how I felt them... things like revenge... there's something noble about revenge... something aesthetically pleasing about it.' Every Cave song was a protracted howl of anguish at the world, every performance a conscious acting-out of the maxim 'that which does not kill us, makes us stronger'. His offstage existence, too, was messy and volatile, an exile's survival course made all the more torturous by a burgeoning addiction to heroin, and a subsequent blurring of the already amorphous boundary between Cave's incendiary art and his life. Later, throughout the Nineties - as a strung out solo performer backed by an only slightly less dissolute and equally serious bunch of musicians known collectively as the Bad Seeds - he refined his subject matter and became a kind of bastard offspring of Antonin Artaud and Leonard Cohen. The cruelty and righteous anger of old was now tempered with a creeping melancholy that has remained a constant ever since. Then, having finally kicked heroin, his adopted persona as rock's reigning prodigal reached its illogical conclusion on an album called Murder Ballads, where he duetted with a colourful cast of foils that included the aforementioned MacGowan, the equally obsessive P. J. Harvey and, unlikeliest of all, erstwhile Australian soap star, Kylie Minogue. In the press his name was romantically linked with Minogue, who became a muse of sorts for a while, even inspiring a lecture, The Secret Life of the Love Song, delivered at the Royal Festival Hall. He had a short but tempestuous affair with Harvey, the breakdown of which was alluded to in some detail on the ensuing album, 1999's The Boatman's Call. On that record Cave executed one of the most startling turnarounds in recent pop history, suddenly reborn as a singer of slow, softly enunciated and often palpably spiritual love songs. As Simon Reynolds put it in his thought-provoking book Blissed Out: The Raptures of Rock: 'The fireball had become an ember.' Where once he raged against the world on wilfully profane songs like 'Fingers Down The Throat of Love' and 'I'm Gonna Kill That Woman', now he sang of the peace that passeth understanding on compositions like; 'Lime Tree Arbour' and 'Into My Arms'. The latter song, sung to a stately piano accompaniment, evoked a mood of almost hymn-like serenity. As well as having the best and bravest opening line of any recent pop song - 'I don't believe in an interventionist God' - it suggested a profound sea-change had occurred, not just in Cave's subject matter and approach to music but in his way of looking at the world. It felt, in fact, like he had, literally and metaphorically, been born again. And, in a way, he had. 'All sorts of elements came together at that time,' he elaborates, running his long fingers through his mane of unruly black hair and lighting up the latest of many furiously smoked cigarettes, 'the main one being that I got married. I also made it past the 40 mark, and I'm always, erm, amused by that, if nothing else. Certainly for me, it was a cut-off point in some profound sense. Things fell into place. 'Before that there was always this tremendous sense of panic, the feeling that every song I wrote was going to be the last. It was not, looking back, a particularly clever way to live.' The underlying causes of this all-pervasive sense of panic are detailed in 'The Secret Life of the Love Song' essay, where he writes: 'My artistic life has centred around an attempt to articulate an almost palpable sense of loss that laid claim to my life. A great gaping hole was blasted out of my world by the unexpected death of my father when I was 19 years old. The way I learned to fill this hole, this void, was to write.' The chaotic living, the drug- taking, and the violent but seldom cathartic live performances were, for a while anyway, another less focused symptom of this profound sense of loss. 'I don't regret all of that,' he says, matter-of-factly, 'absolutely not. I mean, I even had a good time for a while, and felt pretty good despite the way I looked. I was young and I didn't question things back then, I just barrelled along. What I do regret though is the time that I wasted. There was an awful lot of waiting around.' He pauses for longer than usual, as if he has already revealed too much of himself, then, tentatively, continues: 'Because of the way I was living, and because every day felt like the end of things, it felt like I was just fucking squeezing the toothpaste dry. All the time. Then suddenly I got to 40 and it just became clear that, if I followed certain guiding principles, and didn't do things for the wrong reasons, there was no reason why I could not just carry on. With that realisation came a certain calmness and freedom.' The new songs bear this out. They sound less frenetic than before but a slow-burning intensity and, at times, anxiety endures. You can hear it in places on the new album, No More Shall We Part, which is, intriguingly, a lot less calm and a whole lot less confessional than its predecessor. He is pleased that I have connected with this shift of emphasis. 'One thing I like about the songs on the new record, and don't like about The Boatman's Call, is that you don't have to know anything about the personal narrative that accompanies them. I find that confessional mode (he all but spits out the phrase) I slipped into back there incredibly difficult to listen to now. There is a school of thought that thinks the confessional is honest and courageous but I don't agree with that. I think it is the easiest way to write provided you are locked into a kind of masturbatory frame of mind, which I was back there. I mean, I was making a big heroic melodrama out of a bog-standard rejection by a woman.' According to their author, the songs on No More Shall We Part are 'the most straightforward and accurate reflection of the way I feel about things'. Many of them, including the beautifully pitched 'Love Letter', exude an almost luxurious melancholy; some, like 'Oh my Lord' and 'Hallelujah' are filled with the biblical language and imagery that has been his main stock in trade of late; one, the blackly humorous 'God Is In The House', written from the point of view of an American, small-town, God-fearing fundamentalist, even reveals a late flowering gift for social satire. All the songs were written over the past year in an newly acquired office near his west London home, where, he tells me proudly, he goes to work every day. Songwriting, then, has become a regular nine-to-five job, which is as telling a reflection of the new disciplined and rigorous Nick Cave as his heroin habit was of the unruly, uncentred Nick Cave of old. A man of extremes. In April Penguin will publish The Complete Lyrics of Nick Cave, a literary canonisation which has only previously been bestowed on a select few, most notably Bob Dylan, his long time musical hero. 'I had to sit down and plough through everything I had ever written from 1978 to now, in one day,' he grimaces. 'Page after page of this relentless writing which, on the page, was more amusing than anything. The early stuff was pretty ambitious for its time, but so depressing. It was like I felt I had to thrust everything down everybody's throat all the time to make sure they absolutely got the message. 'That's a fearful way to make music,' he adds, ruefully. 'It takes its toll.' He has come through though. And I for one say Hallelujah to that. And No More Shall We Part is released on Mute on 2 April. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds begin a tour at The Olympia in Dublin on 28 April, culminating at Brixton Academy on 5 and 6 May. The Complete Lyrics of Nick Cave is published by Penguin Books on 26 April",

Deciding which 1,000 is even harder when you have a personal database of 14,000 names to choose from.</p> <p>Last year's bash was in a spectacular setting overlooking Westminster Abbey, and the entrance got so bunged-up that a disembodied voice periodically pleaded with guests to move further into the cavernous room to allow new arrivals a look in, rather like the tube in the rush hour. The only glimpse many guests caught of their hostess was when she stood on a podium with her husband, former ITN and Panorama journalist Richard Lindley, to make a little speech in which, as well as thanking everyone for coming, paying tribute to her beloved mother, now dead, and her Auntie Eileen, Carole plugged her new book on networking, her appearance in a BBC programme and her plans to extend her monthly salon to New York.</p> <p>They may have caught a glimpse, however, of a few great and good faces: recent guests have included Jeremy Paxman and Sue Lawley, top lawyers Baronesses Mallalieu and Kennedy; Michael Portillo and David Milliband, head of Tony Blair's policy unit, and defence minister Baroness Symons. They might have rubbed shoulders with Rory Bremner, Sinead Cusack and Jeremy Irons, or chatted to Deborah Moggach and Sir John Mortimer.</p> <p>You might be forgiven for thinking that Carole Stone is a pushy socialite, oiling the wheels of a metropolitan elite whose members orbit tirelessly around each other, but you'd be wrong. Carole is an exuberant working-class woman, a career woman who has carved her ability to get on with all sorts of people into a successful niche as a media consultant and the queen of networking. But she is certainly a phenomenon. 'Carole has filled a gap in the market. If she didn't exist, you would have to invent her,' says Will Hutton, chairman of the Industrial Society. Except you couldn't.</p> <p>She may have been producer of BBC radio's Any Questions for 20 years and be on friendly terms with some of the most influential and powerful people in the land, but public school and Oxbridge couldn't be further away from her origins in Southampton, as the daughter of corner-shop owner and ex-army boxer ('Nobody messed with Nobby Stone'); a shy and gawky girl who, while anxious about her bulky 5ft 10in frame and big nose, desperately wanted to make friends. Her brother Roger, a schizophrenic, suffered from terrible mood swings and was pathologically withdrawn. 'The emphasis was always on getting him to join in,' she recalls. 'I would be so pleased if anyone did get him to.' She would bribe him to go square dancing - just one dance - with a coffee at the Wimpy Bar.</p> <p>Sixty next year (although she could easily pass for late forties), putting people at their ease and getting them to join in is what Carole is very, very good at. 'I'm always weighing people up,' she says, her beautiful grey-blue eyes looking directly into mine. She makes a cupping gesture with her hands. 'I feel like a potter. I've always enjoyed getting the mould of people. You are always juggling with them until you see them respond and they relax with you.'</p> <p>Carole began honing her skills as a hostess when she was a typist in the BBC newsroom at Southampton, inviting friends, colleagues and family to her flat for simple lunches. As she worked her way up the BBC, producing Down Your Way , Woman's Hour and Any Questions , her potential guest list swelled with the names of prominent public figures. When she left the BBC in 1990, disappointed that they did not see her as the answer to Oprah Winfrey, she carried on giving lunches at her tiny Covent Garden flat as a way of keeping in touch. It amuses her to recall how she fed the country's opinion- formers on 'TSLs' - tuna salad lunches that took 20 minutes to prepare and cost \u00a34.19 a head, plus wine and water.</p> <p>They still come to lunch, but now she is paid by half a dozen companies which retain her to introduce senior executives to movers and shakers from business, politics and the media. An agony aunt might find herself chatting to NHS executives; senior officers from the police could be passing the bread rolls to a commentator on race relations; the director of a museum might be sitting next to the people from Camelot. Carole always hopes to land 'a goodie, people who are accountable, in positions of power and influence - an MP, successful company chairmen or CEOs who are normally very, very busy'.</p> <p>They may get more than a TSL these days but Carole never, ever lets the food get in the way. A hostess must never slave over a hot stove. Making sure that guests are at ease and the conversation flowing is far more important. Her new book, subtitled The Art of Making Friends , offers excoriating examples of how not to be the perfect hostess. 'Sally [giving a dinner party] lets everyone sit where they want to. John and Fiona look dismayed to end up sitting next to each other (they've almost run out of conversation), and on her other side Fiona is sitting next to someone she hasn't yet been introduced to. Sally serves the soup, plonks herself down, then continually jumps up and down checking the cheese souffl\u00e9, which is the main course.'</p> <p>At her monthly salon in her second, bigger Covent Garden flat, the entry ticket for the 50 or so guests is simply whether Carole likes you or finds you interesting. The throng includes personal friends as well as contacts, who, unlike those at the salons given by the great political and literary hostesses of the past, cut across the traditional divisions of class, race and age.</p> <p>Carole's huge smile greets them in the hall, lined with framed press cuttings all about the hostess. 'Lovely to see you! This is Roger Levinson, professor of media and communications at LSE; this is Charles Clarke, the Home Office minister; this is Adam Faith, I loved all his records when I was younger. This is Bill Morris, leader of the T&amp;G. This is my friend Sally.' Richard Lindley circulates with the wine and water, provided by Carole. But there are strictly no nibbles - they might get in the way.</p> <p>Why is everybody there? Carole, with customary modesty, believes that she acts as a kind of short cut, getting people together who are so busy juggling work and family commitments that they might not otherwise have the opportunity to meet. A self-confessed 'people addict', she points out that those who have reached the top in business may not share her enthusiasm. 'They've got there because they are damned good at figures or strategy, or putting the deal together. But they are not necessarily good at the people business. In some ways, their position makes thing worse. They might think, \"Because I'm chairman, people will come and talk to me.\" Or you often find that the star at a do is a little bit lonely because the other guests think, \"He's too important to talk to me.\"'</p> <p>Rosalind Savill, director of the Wallace Collection, of which Carole is a trustee, enthuses about the interesting people at Carole's dos, the kind she isn't likely to meet elsewhere. 'Carole has been vital in helping raise our media profile. We needed someone zappy and exciting who makes sure the Collection gets an airing out there.'</p> <p>Geoff Dunlop, producer and director of Leaders of Society , part of the current BBC series The Middle Classes , has featured the salon in his programme. In a world in which the old certainties of male, upper-class-dominated social hierarchy have broken down, and the network has replaced the old-school tie and the gentleman's club, Carole, he believes, is an example of the 'new fluidity'. 'She is either the lubricant or the glue that sticks things together. She doesn't represent anything significant in terms of influence, or power, or control, but there's a kind of emotional honesty and directness about her that's very unusual in the context in which she operates, where everyone has a hidden agenda, everyone is looking over their shoul der and has a veiled, ironic distance on what they do. Carole completely breaks those rules. She is not like the types she's dealing with, and that's incredibly attractive to people. If you deal with Carole, you are not going to get stabbed in the back.'</p> <p>And what's in it for Carole, apart from the consultancy fees? Why would anybody want to spend their days, weekends included, 'debriefing': topping up and updating her database, fulfilling promises to pass on a phone number or send out an invitation. Her husband queries her need to answer every single phone call or letter so assiduously, but she feels she must. A former president of the Media Society, she finds invitations to judge the New Statesman 's new media awards or stand for the committee of the Women in Journalism networking group irresistible.</p> <p>'A lot of what I do is from insecurity,' she claims disarmingly. 'I've always wanted as many friends as I can get, I've never lost that feeling.' But her relationship with Lindley, whom she has known for 12 years and married 18 months ago, is mellowing her. 'It's silly and disgraceful that I still worry that I'm not somewhere I want to be. I think maturity will have finally hit in when someone says, \"Didn't you go to so-and-so's last night?\" and I say, \"Oh, didn't know it was on, what a shame, I'll go next time,\" instead of going \"Aaaargh\",' - at which she doubles up and makes stabbing gestures at her stomach.</p> <p>Dedicating time to writing her book has also grounded her. 'I have realised you can have a spare lunch and live. It used to be beyond me to sit in at lunch. If I wasn't doing anything by 12 o'clock, I'd ring someone up and ask if they were free. But I'll always like meeting new people. Even if we lived in Dorset and saw the same set of 12 people every other week, I'd still be busy introducing people. I'm not ready to give up yet.'</p> <p>But what if a time comes when everyone wants to give up Carole? Agony aunt Virginia Ironside, who has been a lunch and Christmas-party guest, says she has nothing to worry about. 'She's an attractive character and she'll always make friends. Even in the old people's home, she'd be making everything go with a swing. I'd love to be in an old people's home with her. It doesn't really matter if your friends last if you have that ability. There's nothing odd about it, it's something to be envied, a gift.'</p> <p>\u0095</p>",

Carole completely breaks those rules. She is not like the types she's dealing with, and that's incredibly attractive to people. If you deal with Carole, you are not going to get stabbed in the back.' And what's in it for Carole, apart from the consultancy fees? Why would anybody want to spend their days, weekends included, 'debriefing': topping up and updating her database, fulfilling promises to pass on a phone number or send out an invitation. Her husband queries her need to answer every single phone call or letter so assiduously, but she feels she must. A former president of the Media Society, she finds invitations to judge the New Statesman 's new media awards or stand for the committee of the Women in Journalism networking group irresistible. 'A lot of what I do is from insecurity,' she claims disarmingly. 'I've always wanted as many friends as I can get, I've never lost that feeling.' But her relationship with Lindley, whom she has known for 12 years and married 18 months ago, is mellowing her. 'It's silly and disgraceful that I still worry that I'm not somewhere I want to be. I think maturity will have finally hit in when someone says, \"Didn't you go to so-and-so's last night?\" and I say, \"Oh, didn't know it was on, what a shame, I'll go next time,\" instead of going \"Aaaargh\",' - at which she doubles up and makes stabbing gestures at her stomach. Dedicating time to writing her book has also grounded her. 'I have realised you can have a spare lunch and live. It used to be beyond me to sit in at lunch. If I wasn't doing anything by 12 o'clock, I'd ring someone up and ask if they were free. But I'll always like meeting new people. Even if we lived in Dorset and saw the same set of 12 people every other week, I'd still be busy introducing people. I'm not ready to give up yet.' But what if a time comes when everyone wants to give up Carole? Agony aunt Virginia Ironside, who has been a lunch and Christmas-party guest, says she has nothing to worry about. 'She's an attractive character and she'll always make friends. Even in the old people's home, she'd be making everything go with a swing. I'd love to be in an old people's home with her. It doesn't really matter if your friends last if you have that ability. There's nothing odd about it, it's something to be envied, a gift.' \u0095",

      "body": "<p>I'm sure you agree with me. Returning from abroad by plane, the view of Britain from the window is one of pretty much unremitting greenness. You're not just struck by it but awestruck - particularly if you're flying into London. In late summer, it seems less like a city than a scattering of buildings over gentle, wooded hills.</p> <p>Everywhere you look, there are trees. Big clumps of them. Long rows of them. Great marching avenues of them. Nor is this apparent greenness an illusion. London's tree population is currently 5.9m - about three for every four humans. If not quite a forest city, then certainly the world's most tree-blessed megalopolis.</p> <p>Now imagine you're gazing down at the British landscape as it was 100 years ago. It's Merchant Ivory time. There are fields and farms, complete with water meadows, horse-drawn ploughs and crop rotation. When we sing songs of praise to our green and pleasant land, this is the Britain in our mind's eye. So how many trees do you see in that dreamy late-Victorian landscape? More, far more or about the same as there are now? Wrong, wrong, wrong. In 1900, just 5 per cent of the country was tree-covered. A century later, that figure has more than doubled. Even more surprisingly, a big hunk of that increase is recent.</p> <p>By 1980, our tree-cover was up to 9.2 per cent.

      "bodyText": "I'm sure you agree with me. Returning from abroad by plane, the view of Britain from the window is one of pretty much unremitting greenness. You're not just struck by it but awestruck - particularly if you're flying into London. In late summer, it seems less like a city than a scattering of buildings over gentle, wooded hills. Everywhere you look, there are trees. Big clumps of them. Long rows of them. Great marching avenues of them. Nor is this apparent greenness an illusion. London's tree population is currently 5.9m - about three for every four humans. If not quite a forest city, then certainly the world's most tree-blessed megalopolis. Now imagine you're gazing down at the British landscape as it was 100 years ago. It's Merchant Ivory time. There are fields and farms, complete with water meadows, horse-drawn ploughs and crop rotation. When we sing songs of praise to our green and pleasant land, this is the Britain in our mind's eye. So how many trees do you see in that dreamy late-Victorian landscape? More, far more or about the same as there are now? Wrong, wrong, wrong. In 1900, just 5 per cent of the country was tree-covered. A century later, that figure has more than doubled. Even more surprisingly, a big hunk of that increase is recent. By 1980, our tree-cover was up to 9.2 per cent. Since then we've not just offset the loss of 19m trees to the storms of 1987 and 1990, as well as 30m to Dutch elm disease, but achieved a 25 per cent increase in tree-cover. According to just-released Forestry Commission figures, it is now 11.8 per cent.

      "body": "<p>I remember the time when my wife could and would eat four square meals a day, and frequent snacks between, without gaining an ounce. 'Not true,' she said when I reminded her of this. 'It was three breakfasts, two lunches, three teas, two dinners and endless snacks and chocolate.' </p> <p>She didn't feel the cold either. She'd walk around dressed like a Geordie clubber - T-shirt on a snowy day. That's Graves' disease for you. There was also a time when she slept 10 hours a night and ate nothing but the occasional banana, yet still put on weight. Graves' again. Whether gorging or starving, her muscles got progressively softer - despite long hours of practice for her work as a teacher of dance. Graves', too. </p> <p>And there was a day she was banned from buses, followed by three weeks when she wasn't allowed within shouting distance of our young son. That was the treatment for Graves' - a shot of radioactive iodine (I-131). It doesn't exactly light you up like Chernobyl but it is potent enough to be a possible danger to strangers for 24 hours and to the developing body of a six-year-old for 21 days. So, long mother-son cuddles were out for three weeks - hard to explain to a small boy who'd just started school and often needed to come home to his mother's arms at the end of a testing day. </p> <p>So she went away, first to her mother's, then to a dance course. 'Apparently, that was the worst thing I could have done. I should have done something very peaceful which would have helped calm the thyroid.' So not to your mother's, then? 'Exactly,' she laughed. </p> <p>Graves' disease is the most common cause of an overactive thyroid - the 20g gland in the pit of our throats which controls our metabolism. In the words of the BMA's excellent booklet Understanding Thyroid Disorders (\u00a32.49, Family Doctor), the thyroid 'is responsible for the normal working of every cell in the body'. It's a widespread disease without being exactly common - estimates range between one in 25 and one in 1,000. Many experts think it is considerably underdiagnosed. It's most common in 'women in the middle decades' - eight to 10 times more so than in men. It's not something you can catch, but a susceptibility to it is inheritable. </p> <p>My mother-in-law had it. Her brother died as a result of it, young. Undiagnosed in life, his thyroid problem was revealed in his autopsy. As is often the case, an overactive thyroid had transformed itself into an underactive one - hyper to hypothyroidism. Untreated with medication, hypothyroidism can lead to heart attack or stroke. </p> <p>In the 19th century, the mortality rate for the disease was probably 50 per cent. Because its symptoms are mostly just exaggerations of normal behaviour, it is often not spotted, either by the sufferer or their doctor. My wife's first symptom was the shakes. 'I thought it was low blood sugar. I'd eat carbohydrates - bread, biscuits, chocolate - and it would subside. So that convinced me it was low blood sugar.' This went on for years. A demanding physical routine meant discomfort and pain had always been part of her daily life. Also, according to a 1996 article in The Physician and Sportsmedicine , 'certain symptoms can mimic sports-related concerns such as overtraining'. So the way her system was playing up was far less surprising than it would have been to someone less active. 'My shakiness became so bad that my handwriting was affected.' Then her usually thick, strong hair thinned out and her eyes started to bulge. </p> <p>At its most extreme, Graves' gives people eyes that look like they're coming right out of their heads. 'All the symptoms develop gradually, though, so you don't really notice it. But I do remember flying into furies at you. Things did irritate me a lot. I never felt calm. I had an inability to concentrate. I'd also become totally exhausted. It was a constant switch between being energetic and feeling drained. It was exhausting to do anything.' </p> <p>As she's always been better at multi-tasking than focusing, I wasn't that struck by her loss of concentration. If it was more pronounced than usual, I suppose I put it down to the strain of overactivity. At the time, it simply seemed as if she was taking on too much. Now I realise it was probably a thyroid-driven hyperactivity. It was like being Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer's Apprentice : outbursts of energy leading to profound torpor. 'Looking back,' she says, 'I can't believe I put up with it. I thought: this is what happens as you become older. The relief when I found out it was thyroid was huge.' </p> <p>Eventually, she went to see Dr Bruce Fowler, the consultant who had uncovered her mother's Graves'. Dr Fowler's diagnosis was immediate. He put her on the standard medication, carbimozole, which serves as a chemical blockade on the thyroid. Her progress was checked by regular blood tests. 'The number of tablets went down quickly, to one eventually.' It's not a rapid process, though. The drugs take effect cumulatively. First, the endocrine system stabilises. Only then do you begin to start feeling stable. </p> <p>Over time, she learned about the disease, progressing to knowledgeable conversations with her doctors about her levels of the relevant hormones - T3, T4 and TSH. Too much T3 and T4 produces a faster heart beat and increases anxiety. The thyroid is a switching point for the body's control of the three Fs - fear, flight and fright. Depression seems to be linked to T3 levels. </p> <p>Oddly, the final touch of balance came with the birth of our third child - the boy she had to leave behind when she had the radioactive iodine treatment. I say 'oddly' because while some people are predisposed to Graves', it's often only triggered by major physical or emotional events, such as divorce or childbirth. Jennifer thinks hers was set off by the birth of our second child, a girl - so it is possible that the different sexes were having different hormonal effects. 'The birth itself balanced me out. But five months later, when I went back to work, the Graves' came shooting back.' </p> <p>Till then, she'd strongly resisted the idea of a shot of radioactive iodine. 'But eventually, enough was enough.' Not before she'd tried just about everything else, though. Homeopathy, Chinese herbs and even, one dark Saturday night, a faith healer - the only time the disease caused a serious falling out between us. I'm too much a rationalist not to put faith-healing in the same category as strychnine-drinking - only less interesting. Medical practitioners are insistent that there are no 'natural' cures for Graves'. </p> <p>The iodine treatment has been around since about 1940 and is perfectly safe - though about one in 10 patients requires a second shot. The amount of radiation used is small and does not cause cancer. But the procedure itself is scary. At the hospital I watched through glass as Jennifer was placed in a lead-lined room. The nurse left the room. She took a pill from a lead-lined box - this was the 400ml of I-131. She took the pill. We left the hospital. I drove her to her mother's, left her there - slightly radioactive - and returned home to look after our (nuclear) family. </p> <p>The treatment worked steadily rather than quickly. This is common. The best study found that '20 per cent of patients required at least a year before they felt as if they had recovered, independent of the type of therapy'. But gradually, she once again became more the person she felt she really was. 'Carbimozole just suppresses the symptoms. Only after the iodine I-131 did my hair get thicker again and my muscles get their strength back.' As the radioactive zap puts thyroid levels way below the 'correct' level, this imbalance then has to be corrected with thyroxine - a synthetic version of the thyroid's natural T4. </p> <p>She started out on 150mcg of thyroxine. Two years later, she's down to 50. 'It's still difficult to balance my thyroid, though.' You never really get rid of Graves', it seems. You just even yourself out, with a mixture of treatment, medication and lifestyle. 'I still need to achieve a more regular life,' she admitted - these past few weeks, her thyroid has dipped again. According to the Thyroid Foundation of America, 40 to 70 per cent of those who've had the treatment develop abnormally low levels of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) within 10 years. </p> <p>Another major problem is that Graves' sufferers no longer know what is 'normal' for them. It strikes to the heart of our understanding of our personalities, asking awkward questions about our temperament. How much of the way we act and feel - or, more subtly but maybe more importantly, the way we feel we feel - is down to chemical levels in our endocrine system? </p> <p>At its most extreme, it can completely distort a personality. John Coogan of the University of Michigan has written a soon-to-be-published paper on one victim, Sir Cecil Spring Rice. While ambassador to the US during the First World War, Spring Rice's condition deteriorated to the point where his dispatches to London became incoherent rants about an international German-Jewish-Irish-Catholic-Democrat conspiracy headed by the Kaiser and his chief lieutenant, the Pope. Despite being quite clearly barking mad, he remained in post till 1917. He died a year later of a sudden heart attack. </p> <p>Nor is he the only powerful political Graves' victim there's been in Washington. George Bush had it, so did his wife Barbara. We know that it's a genetic thing. We know it's triggered by stress. We know George and Barbara's son has one of the world's more stressful jobs. Maybe we should duck.</p> <p><strong> Facts and figures </strong></p> <p> \u0095 Graves' disease was first noted in the General Hospital, Bath in 1786 by Caleb Hillier Parry, though his account wasn't published till 1825. </p> <p> \u0095 It's named after RJ Graves, an Irish physician who reported it in an 1835 edition of the London Medical Journal.</p> <p>\u0095 In Europe it's called Basedow's, named after another putative doctor-discoverer. </p> <p>\u0095 According to Douglas S Ross MD of Harvard Medical School: 'It is an autoimmune disease characterised by antibodies against the thyroptin (TSH) receptor.

'For reasons that are not understood', says Ross, 'the immune system produces an antibody that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. The current guess is that the antibody is able to do this because it looks like the genuine pituitary hormone.' </p> <p>\u0095 It is associated with the genes HLA (human leucocyte antigen) B8, -DRw3, -Bw36 and -Bw46. About 10 per cent of us have these genes, but only a small percentage of that 10 per cent will develop the disease.</p>",

The current guess is that the antibody is able to do this because it looks like the genuine pituitary hormone.' \u0095 It is associated with the genes HLA (human leucocyte antigen) B8, -DRw3, -Bw36 and -Bw46. About 10 per cent of us have these genes, but only a small percentage of that 10 per cent will develop the disease.",

      "byline": "Heather Connon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Smiths Group had a lot to do to win back favour in the City following its unpopular acquisition of TI Group. Last week's interim results were a good first step. </p> <p>JP Morgan, architect of the much-maligned deal, has come up with an elegant facesaver to help Smiths ditch TI's particularly hated automotive business. Car production in the US, half of the division's market, is stuck in a giant traffic jam and, until it is clear that the Federal Reserve can get things moving again, trade buyers are not interested and venture capitalists are cutting the price to such ludicrously low levels that even a desperate Smiths could not accept. </p> <p>The solution is a demerger, with the twist that Smiths manages to extract \u00a3940 million in cash and preference shares, underwritten by JP Morgan, and will retain a 19.99 per cent stake in a business that may, eventually, be worth the \u00a31.2 billion-\u00a31.4bn that buyers were indicating they would pay for it just six months ago. </p> <p>The reward for innovation was a 4 per cent rise in the price last week from 675p at the start of week - doubly impressive given collapsing shares elsewhere. But the City was also encouraged by other aspects of its performance, particularly the 15 per cent rise in the medical division, fuelled by things such as a needle with a built-in cover, which cuts down accidents when thrown away. </p> <p>The industrial division also grew faster than analysts had expected, led by supplying small components for mobile masts and other bits of telecoms equipment. Smiths says there has so far been no sign of a slowdown in orders, but it would be foolish to bank on profits growing by 36 per cent indefinitely. </p> <p>None of these had anything to do with the TI acquisition - they were both in the Smith stable anyway. But there was encouraging news on integration, too. Smiths was obviously stung by complaints that the \u00a325m it was offering in synergy benefits was too low and has upped it to \u00a380m within the next two years, with the hint that there could be still more to come. </p> <p>But the real reason Smiths bought TI was to get its hands on Dowty, its aerospace business, both to boost its own product range and its customer base. Performance from this division was respectable enough but the synergies are still at the talking stage - it is putting in joint bids for things like the A380 contract. The test of the merger will be how successful that will be - and it will take years before that is clear. </p> <p>Chief executive Keith Butler Wheelhouse is so confident he is promising earnings of 60p for the year to this July, 70p next and 80p the year after. That sounds dangerously as if he is joining the 20 per cent club, which ejected Rentokil's Sir Clive Thompson. His experience must make us wary of chief executives who make themselves hostages to fortune. But Smiths has a good enough record to deserve the benefit of the doubt. Buy. </p> <p><strong> Don't B&amp;Q it</strong><br> </p> <p> Sir Geoff Mulcahy, chief executive of Kingfisher, is signing up to the 10 per cent club. That is what he is promising in earnings growth for the next five years, should he succeed in hiving off the troublesome Woolworths and Superdrug chains. </p> <p>If he expected the City to be ecstatic, he was disappointed. While earnings fell by 12 per cent last year, for the previous two years the increases were 23 and 16 per cent. While retail growth has slowed - the rest of the retail sector will struggle to achieve 8 per cent growth - Kingfisher's dominance in the UK DIY market through B&amp;Q, its European investments and its forays into exciting places like eastern Europe and China were supposed to make it a cut above the rest. </p> <p>Of course, Sir Geoff may just be trying to ensure he does not become a hostage to fortune, or leaving room to surprise on the upside. On the basis of last year's results, it will have to work hard to do that. B&amp;Q remains the powerhouse of the business, and its position can only be strengthened when the new owners of Homebase start to take it more into furnishing and fabrics. But Castorama, the equivalent in France, is still having problems. </p> <p>In electricals, Comet is going through one of its better periods but at Darty in France, margins are being squeezed although profits are racing ahead. In Germany, ProMarkt's dismal performance confirmed everyone's fears about the deal. </p> <p>Then there is Superdrug and Woolworths. Sir Geoff insists that the plans for demerger are on track but the rumours of buyers for Superdrug continue to swirl. The problem is, a trade sale of Superdrug would leave Woolworths looking exposed. Its new formats, like Big W and the drugstores, sell many Superdrug lines and finding alternative suppliers could add to costs.

      "bodyText": "Smiths Group had a lot to do to win back favour in the City following its unpopular acquisition of TI Group. Last week's interim results were a good first step. JP Morgan, architect of the much-maligned deal, has come up with an elegant facesaver to help Smiths ditch TI's particularly hated automotive business. Car production in the US, half of the division's market, is stuck in a giant traffic jam and, until it is clear that the Federal Reserve can get things moving again, trade buyers are not interested and venture capitalists are cutting the price to such ludicrously low levels that even a desperate Smiths could not accept. The solution is a demerger, with the twist that Smiths manages to extract \u00a3940 million in cash and preference shares, underwritten by JP Morgan, and will retain a 19.99 per cent stake in a business that may, eventually, be worth the \u00a31.2 billion-\u00a31.4bn that buyers were indicating they would pay for it just six months ago. The reward for innovation was a 4 per cent rise in the price last week from 675p at the start of week - doubly impressive given collapsing shares elsewhere. But the City was also encouraged by other aspects of its performance, particularly the 15 per cent rise in the medical division, fuelled by things such as a needle with a built-in cover, which cuts down accidents when thrown away. The industrial division also grew faster than analysts had expected, led by supplying small components for mobile masts and other bits of telecoms equipment. Smiths says there has so far been no sign of a slowdown in orders, but it would be foolish to bank on profits growing by 36 per cent indefinitely. None of these had anything to do with the TI acquisition - they were both in the Smith stable anyway. But there was encouraging news on integration, too. Smiths was obviously stung by complaints that the \u00a325m it was offering in synergy benefits was too low and has upped it to \u00a380m within the next two years, with the hint that there could be still more to come. But the real reason Smiths bought TI was to get its hands on Dowty, its aerospace business, both to boost its own product range and its customer base. Performance from this division was respectable enough but the synergies are still at the talking stage - it is putting in joint bids for things like the A380 contract. The test of the merger will be how successful that will be - and it will take years before that is clear. Chief executive Keith Butler Wheelhouse is so confident he is promising earnings of 60p for the year to this July, 70p next and 80p the year after. That sounds dangerously as if he is joining the 20 per cent club, which ejected Rentokil's Sir Clive Thompson. His experience must make us wary of chief executives who make themselves hostages to fortune. But Smiths has a good enough record to deserve the benefit of the doubt. Buy. Don't B&amp;Q it Sir Geoff Mulcahy, chief executive of Kingfisher, is signing up to the 10 per cent club. That is what he is promising in earnings growth for the next five years, should he succeed in hiving off the troublesome Woolworths and Superdrug chains. If he expected the City to be ecstatic, he was disappointed. While earnings fell by 12 per cent last year, for the previous two years the increases were 23 and 16 per cent. While retail growth has slowed - the rest of the retail sector will struggle to achieve 8 per cent growth - Kingfisher's dominance in the UK DIY market through B&amp;Q, its European investments and its forays into exciting places like eastern Europe and China were supposed to make it a cut above the rest. Of course, Sir Geoff may just be trying to ensure he does not become a hostage to fortune, or leaving room to surprise on the upside. On the basis of last year's results, it will have to work hard to do that. B&amp;Q remains the powerhouse of the business, and its position can only be strengthened when the new owners of Homebase start to take it more into furnishing and fabrics. But Castorama, the equivalent in France, is still having problems. In electricals, Comet is going through one of its better periods but at Darty in France, margins are being squeezed although profits are racing ahead. In Germany, ProMarkt's dismal performance confirmed everyone's fears about the deal. Then there is Superdrug and Woolworths. Sir Geoff insists that the plans for demerger are on track but the rumours of buyers for Superdrug continue to swirl. The problem is, a trade sale of Superdrug would leave Woolworths looking exposed. Its new formats, like Big W and the drugstores, sell many Superdrug lines and finding alternative suppliers could add to costs. Woolworths is also absorbing cash, both through investment in the traditional stores and in rolling out the new formats. Superdrug could throw off enough to finance that: Woolworths on its own would be hard-pressed to do it. Sir Geoff would have to work to persuade investors that it is viable as a stand-alone business. But the venture capitalists seem unwilling to offer more than \u00a3700m at best, including \u00a3200m of property - less than the City has been led to expect. Kingfisher's shares have more than halved from their peak two years ago but it is hard to see what will precipitate a real recovery. They are a hold at best.

      "body": "<p>Defence is a nasty business. Normal rules of engagement don't apply. The buzzwords of mainstream industry - level playing fields, fair competition - have never sat comfortably with the business of war. </p> <p>The relationship between the Government (constantly trying to equip forces at reasonable cost, balancing security concerns and maintaining strategically important jobs) and industry (dominated by the UK giant BAE Systems and the host of foreign and smaller defence contractors scrambling for orders) has always been tense. Now it has descended into an open feud. </p> <p>The phrase 'blood on the carpet' was never more apt, and the most soiled piece of upholstery runs along the top floor of the Ministry of Defence's Whitehall HQ to the office of Sir Robert Walmsley, the urbane Chief of Defence Procurement. </p> <p>Walmsley is at the centre of a vituperative spat between BAE and defence contractors, which accuse it of trying to monopolise the defence business. </p> <p>BAE executives are known to have a jaded view of Walmsley, who has fought hard for competition against the background of a consolidation. </p> <p>The row has broken out over shipbuilding. BAE, which owns 90 per cent of UK naval capacity at its Govan and Scotstoun Clydeside yards and at Barrow-in-Furness, has lobbied Walmsley to halt competitions on major orders, and submitted 'unsolicited' bids for MoD work to patch up its threadbare order book. </p> <p>If Walmsley does not comply, BAE warns that it could close yards currently losing \u00a33 million a month. </p> <p>As Martin Jay, head of the smaller South Coast builder Vosper Thornycroft, says: 'BAE is threatening the Government and trying to hold it to ransom by saying it may pull out of shipbuilding unless it is given a monopoly. I hope Ministers will reject these outrageous demands.' </p> <p>Others are equally scathing, but nervous. One US contractor said: 'It is difficult getting team members for UK work who are prepared to go against BAE. They say \"you'll never beat BAE\" and if they do agree they often ask for their names to be kept private.' </p> <p>Walmsley and BAE's competitors are faced by one of the hardest-hitting lobbying operations in UK industry. </p> <p>BAE is headed by Sir Richard Evans, its burly chairman, who is universally respected - and feared - by his competitors. </p> <p>As one industry insider says: 'Dick is entirely ruthless. He is a hard man and gets his own way. But he has also been the most successful in shifting the political ground and courting New Labour. He's one of the few businessmen who can see Blair on request.' </p> <p>Last week Evans met Walmsley, who is said to have made clear his unhappiness over the row. </p> <p>Evans's number two, John Weston, is perhaps less charismatic. But his agenda is clear. 'John is a natural monopolist,' says one expert. 'He wants a return to the 1980s, when you won business with cost-plus contracts rather than taking painful hits on fixed-price deals.' </p> <p>A case in point is the 1996 \u00a32.2bn contract to build the Nimrod maritime patrol plane. When BAE announced it had lost \u00a3300m on the deal earlier this year, and reported that pre-tax profits had slumped from \u00a3459m to \u00a3179m, it's shares dived 30 per cent in a day. </p> <p>MoD officials say that the problems arise from BAE non-executives and shareholders pressuring directors over the losses. Ministry exasperation over the public wrangling is heightened because it feels BAE has simply underbid in most MoD competitions, not just Nimrod. </p> <p>Nevertheless, BAE has been lobbying on shipbuilding since the company was formed in 1999 from the merger of British Aerospace and GEC Marconi. </p> <p>At the time of the merger Weston said: 'Two yards is one too many, and I've now got three.' </p> <p>BAE's sums showed that it needed to invest \u00a3147m in the yards to upgrade them. But it does not have the orders to sustain that. Last month, it tried to plug the gap, putting in unsolicited bids for two Navy support ships. </p> <p>The two most controversial moves have involved Navy flagships - a \u00a35bn contract for 12 Type 45 destroyers, and a \u00a32.5bn deal for two new aircraft carriers. </p> <p>On the first , BAE is 'prime contractor'. It is demanding that all 12 ships are built by BAE Marine - the subsidiary it was forced to create for the Marconi yards at the time of the 1999 merger. This would squeeze Vosper, which, last July, was awarded one of the first three ships, with BAEM taking the other two. </p> <p>Although BAE would give it some work, Vosper is concerned at the monopoly aspects and the competitive problems of BAE being both prime contractor and builder. </p> <p>BAE has raised the stakes further over the aircraft carriers, urging the Government to cut a three-year competition with a consortium headed by Thales of France in order to save time and money. </p> <p>BAE privately argues no other country would consider carriers built by a foreign contractor. The competition is aggrieved. One said: 'It's another exam ple of them trying to close things down, this time using the British card.' </p> <p>For Thales, headed by the combative Frenchman Denis Ranque, this is particularly important. The company last year spent \u00a31.3bn on the UK electronics business Racal to position itself as a big UK player. It is playing the British card, too - it has 14,000 UK employees, putting it at number two. </p> <p>There are serious concerns not only about BAE's direct approach on the carrier contract, but about the competitive implications of its policy on shipyards. </p> <p>One contractor points to merger conditions stating that BAE's Marconi yards must remain available to competitors. If Thales were to win the contract, it could place orders with BAEM - although it has also surveyed other British yards, including Swan Hunter on Tyneside and Harland and Wolff in Belfast. </p> <p>But if BAE yards close before the carrier competition is complete in three years' time, that choice will not be available. BAE could then face a wrangle with the Office of Fair Trading. </p> <p>DTI sources confirmed that BAE could be forced to continue operating or to sell on yards if the OFT judged it was acting anti-competitively. He added: 'Defence is a unique business, and you often get these threats and manoeuvrings.' Nevertheless, it is almost certain that Thales and others would press for investigation. </p> <p>The MoD has taken a robust line, indicating it is unlikely to order new oilers (supply ships), while reserving its position on the Type 45s. </p> <p>Officials point out that BAE has to keep Scotstoun open for Type 45s, whatever strategy is adopted, hinting that the MoD is used to threats to take work overseas, and is not convinced that this one is serious. </p> <p>BAE, however, maintains it is free to close yards down, and is serious about doing so. But the story spreads wider than shipbuilding. Recently BAE asked that a competition to provide a \u00a39bn new generation of 'airborne petrol stations' for the RAF be scrapped. It is competing against Thales and Raytheon, along with Rolls-Royce and other defence giants. </p> <p>BAE's bid returned to the 1980s practice of cost-plus contracts. One of the competitors says: 'This blows BAE's cover. It's not about shipbuilding capacity. They want the competition squeezed and they want their own terms.' </p> <p>US competitors have long found BAE highly skilled at lobbying against foreign bidders. One example was a highly charged bid for a \u00a3900m missile contract to arm Eurofighter planes, which a European consortium, Matra BAE Dynamics, won against Raytheon of the US last year. As one observer said: 'BAE skilfully forged a European alliance, which forced Blair to make a choice - Europe or the US. He chose Europe.' </p> <p>But another pointed out that BAE's strategy is hypocritical. It is building US operations, which now account for 30 per cent of the business. 'In the US they argue, like us, for open competition to sustain their business against US primes. They are trying to have it different ways on each side of the Atlantic.' </p> <p>BAE fiercely rebuts the monopoly claims. It says it makes sense to rationalise overcapacity - particularly in shipbuilding. It should dominate major projects, while a company such as Vosper - which last week secured a \u00a360m contract for three navy patrol vessels - should concentrate on smaller craft. </p> <p>BAE adds that producing long runs of defence orders brings economies of scale and allows improvements to be built in with experience. </p> <p>It also argues that the competition process and fixed-price contracts expose it to too much risk. If BAE doesn't win it faces millions in wasted costs. If it does, it finds difficulties later on, as happened with Nimrod. Here BAE points to the US, where, as on its plans for a Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, the Pentagon shares risk. That is why, BAE says, it is trying to change the rules on Type 45 and carriers. </p> <p>The irony in all of this is Nimrod. It was the abortive plan to provide radar for Nimrod under cost-plus contracting rules that led to the introduction of competitive procurement by the MoD when, in 1986, taxpayers took a \u00a31bn loss on a project that went to America. When the new rules were introduced in the late 1980s, BAE supported them - while risk increased, so did reward. One Nimrod project on, it has changed its tune. </p> <p>Whether BAE's strategy will work is a moot point. As one senior industry figure said: 'BAE is usually subtle. It is not being so now. It is demanding an anti- competitive utopia, and the Government would be mad to grant it.' </p> <p><strong>The billions at stake on the contracts battlefield</strong></p> <p>Defence contracts are notorious for coming in over-budget and late. This affects several of those at the centre of the arguments between BAE, its competitors and the MoD.</p> <p><strong> Type 45 destroyer</strong><br> Intended as a replacement for the Royal Navy's Type 42 destroyers, it will be equipped with the principal anti-air missile system, capable of protecting itself and other ships. The original plan was for a European destroyer, called Horizon, but this was scrapped. Type 45 is the British replacement, and up to 12 will be built. BAE Systems is prime contractor. Costs have risen by \u00a321 million. </p> <p><strong> Future aircraft carrier</strong><br>The replacement for Invincible Class carriers, designed for the Cold War, it will carry helicopters and a range of planes, including the future carrier borne aircraft. </p> <p>Two groups are vying for the prime contract - one led by BAE Systems, the other by Thales of France. The project, worth \u00a32.5 billion plus up to \u00a37bn more on support work, is in the early assessment phase. Prime contractors are to be appointed in three years. The carrier project has so far been below forecast budget.</p> <p><strong> Nimrod MRA4</strong><br>The new-generation Nimrod aims to improve anti-submarine and surface capabilities. BAE won the prime contract in 1996, and completed the first design phase in February 2000. BAE has run into difficulties on delivery dates and manufacture, which lay behind the \u00a3300m loss on the project it announced earlier this year.</p> <p><strong> Astute class submarines</strong><br>GEC Marconi became prime contractor in March 1997 to design and build three replacement vessels for Swiftsure Class nuclear submarines. Design for the project is intended to be complete by 2003. The project has so far run \u00a329m above forecasts. </p> <p><strong> Future strategic tanker aircraft</strong><br>Three consortia are currently bidding to win the prime contract for this 'petrol station in the sky'. BAE Systems is lined up against Thales and facilities management group Serco. The project, worth \u00a39bn, is to provide airborne refuelling to the RAF for up to 25 years.</p> <p><strong>The hard men who play for keeps</strong></p> <p><strong> BAE Systems</strong><br> Giant of the UK aerospace industry, BAE Systems is the second-largest defence company in the world. It was formed in 1977 through the nationalisation of the British Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Siddeley Aviation. Shortly afterwards it joined the European airbus consortium. It was privatised in 1981, and won military orders from Saudi Arabia. Later in the1980s BAE began an acquisitions spree, including Royal Ordnance and Rover, which it later sold to BMW. BAE was transformed by the \u00a37.7 billion merger of British Aerospace with Marconi in 1999, creating Europe's largest defence group. It has expanded in the US - last year buying the Sanders defence business. US operations now account for 30 per cent of business, the UK 17 per cent. BAE has a \u00a341bn order book and sales of \u00a39bn. It has 60 UK sites and 39 overseas, employing 120,000. BAE is headed by chairman Richard Evans and chief executive John Weston. </p> <p> <strong>Thales</strong><br> French defence group Thomson CSF recently renamed itself Thales after the Greek philosopher. Headed by Denis Ranque, it is the second-largest defence contractor in the UK, where operations are headed by Richard Moon. It has 14,500 UK employees, most of whom it acquired when it bought Racal, the UK defence electronics group, for \u00a31.3bn in 2000. </p> <p>The company's origins go back to 1892, with a Franco-American venture to develop electrical processes, which accounted for the English name. It grew into the electronics group Thomson CSF in the 1960s. It was nationalised in 1982. In 1989 Thales bought the defence electronics arm of Dutch company Philips, and in 1997 it was privatised. In June last year Thales completed the Racal merger and divided into three groups: defence, aerospace and IT services. Thales employs 65,000 people worldwide, with sales of \u20ac6.9bn (\u00a34.6bn) and a \u20ac15.4bn order book. </p> <p><strong>Vosper Thorneycroft</strong><br> Compared with BAE and Thales, shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft is a tiddler. Based in Southampton, it has supplied 270 warships to 34 countries over the past 30 years. It is headed by chairman and chief executive Martin Jay. It is a pure shipbuilder/designer with capabilities to produce control systems. VT's 2000 turnover was \u00a3274m, with pre-tax profits of \u00a334m. It employs some 1,300. </p> <p> <strong>Raytheon</strong> <br> One of the top four US defence contractors, Raytheon was founded in 1922, and its origins lay in making radio tubes. It went on to develop the first guided missiles and microwaves. By the Sixties, it was heavily defence-based, with 80 per cent of revenues from the US government. In the Sixties it expanded by acquisition into commercial marine electronics, publishing and oils and gas seismography. </p> <p>Now, under chairman Daniel Burnham, it focuses on defence, and commercial electronics - including missile, surveillance and reconnaissance, satellite and simulator systems. It employs 100,000. Its 1999 sales were $14.5bn (\u00a310bn), with an order book of $28.4bn.</p>",

It is playing the British card, too - it has 14,000 UK employees, putting it at number two. There are serious concerns not only about BAE's direct approach on the carrier contract, but about the competitive implications of its policy on shipyards. One contractor points to merger conditions stating that BAE's Marconi yards must remain available to competitors. If Thales were to win the contract, it could place orders with BAEM - although it has also surveyed other British yards, including Swan Hunter on Tyneside and Harland and Wolff in Belfast. But if BAE yards close before the carrier competition is complete in three years' time, that choice will not be available. BAE could then face a wrangle with the Office of Fair Trading. DTI sources confirmed that BAE could be forced to continue operating or to sell on yards if the OFT judged it was acting anti-competitively. He added: 'Defence is a unique business, and you often get these threats and manoeuvrings.' Nevertheless, it is almost certain that Thales and others would press for investigation. The MoD has taken a robust line, indicating it is unlikely to order new oilers (supply ships), while reserving its position on the Type 45s. Officials point out that BAE has to keep Scotstoun open for Type 45s, whatever strategy is adopted, hinting that the MoD is used to threats to take work overseas, and is not convinced that this one is serious. BAE, however, maintains it is free to close yards down, and is serious about doing so. But the story spreads wider than shipbuilding. Recently BAE asked that a competition to provide a \u00a39bn new generation of 'airborne petrol stations' for the RAF be scrapped. It is competing against Thales and Raytheon, along with Rolls-Royce and other defence giants. BAE's bid returned to the 1980s practice of cost-plus contracts. One of the competitors says: 'This blows BAE's cover. It's not about shipbuilding capacity. They want the competition squeezed and they want their own terms.' US competitors have long found BAE highly skilled at lobbying against foreign bidders. One example was a highly charged bid for a \u00a3900m missile contract to arm Eurofighter planes, which a European consortium, Matra BAE Dynamics, won against Raytheon of the US last year. As one observer said: 'BAE skilfully forged a European alliance, which forced Blair to make a choice - Europe or the US. He chose Europe.' But another pointed out that BAE's strategy is hypocritical. It is building US operations, which now account for 30 per cent of the business. 'In the US they argue, like us, for open competition to sustain their business against US primes. They are trying to have it different ways on each side of the Atlantic.' BAE fiercely rebuts the monopoly claims. It says it makes sense to rationalise overcapacity - particularly in shipbuilding. It should dominate major projects, while a company such as Vosper - which last week secured a \u00a360m contract for three navy patrol vessels - should concentrate on smaller craft. BAE adds that producing long runs of defence orders brings economies of scale and allows improvements to be built in with experience. It also argues that the competition process and fixed-price contracts expose it to too much risk. If BAE doesn't win it faces millions in wasted costs. If it does, it finds difficulties later on, as happened with Nimrod. Here BAE points to the US, where, as on its plans for a Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, the Pentagon shares risk. That is why, BAE says, it is trying to change the rules on Type 45 and carriers. The irony in all of this is Nimrod. It was the abortive plan to provide radar for Nimrod under cost-plus contracting rules that led to the introduction of competitive procurement by the MoD when, in 1986, taxpayers took a \u00a31bn loss on a project that went to America. When the new rules were introduced in the late 1980s, BAE supported them - while risk increased, so did reward. One Nimrod project on, it has changed its tune. Whether BAE's strategy will work is a moot point. As one senior industry figure said: 'BAE is usually subtle. It is not being so now. It is demanding an anti- competitive utopia, and the Government would be mad to grant it.' The billions at stake on the contracts battlefield Defence contracts are notorious for coming in over-budget and late. This affects several of those at the centre of the arguments between BAE, its competitors and the MoD. Type 45 destroyer Intended as a replacement for the Royal Navy's Type 42 destroyers, it will be equipped with the principal anti-air missile system, capable of protecting itself and other ships. The original plan was for a European destroyer, called Horizon, but this was scrapped. Type 45 is the British replacement, and up to 12 will be built. BAE Systems is prime contractor. Costs have risen by \u00a321 million. Future aircraft carrier The replacement for Invincible Class carriers, designed for the Cold War, it will carry helicopters and a range of planes, including the future carrier borne aircraft. Two groups are vying for the prime contract - one led by BAE Systems, the other by Thales of France. The project, worth \u00a32.5 billion plus up to \u00a37bn more on support work, is in the early assessment phase. Prime contractors are to be appointed in three years. The carrier project has so far been below forecast budget. Nimrod MRA4 The new-generation Nimrod aims to improve anti-submarine and surface capabilities. BAE won the prime contract in 1996, and completed the first design phase in February 2000. BAE has run into difficulties on delivery dates and manufacture, which lay behind the \u00a3300m loss on the project it announced earlier this year. Astute class submarines GEC Marconi became prime contractor in March 1997 to design and build three replacement vessels for Swiftsure Class nuclear submarines. Design for the project is intended to be complete by 2003. The project has so far run \u00a329m above forecasts. Future strategic tanker aircraft Three consortia are currently bidding to win the prime contract for this 'petrol station in the sky'. BAE Systems is lined up against Thales and facilities management group Serco. The project, worth \u00a39bn, is to provide airborne refuelling to the RAF for up to 25 years. The hard men who play for keeps BAE Systems Giant of the UK aerospace industry, BAE Systems is the second-largest defence company in the world. It was formed in 1977 through the nationalisation of the British Aircraft Corporation and Hawker Siddeley Aviation. Shortly afterwards it joined the European airbus consortium. It was privatised in 1981, and won military orders from Saudi Arabia. Later in the1980s BAE began an acquisitions spree, including Royal Ordnance and Rover, which it later sold to BMW. BAE was transformed by the \u00a37.7 billion merger of British Aerospace with Marconi in 1999, creating Europe's largest defence group. It has expanded in the US - last year buying the Sanders defence business. US operations now account for 30 per cent of business, the UK 17 per cent. BAE has a \u00a341bn order book and sales of \u00a39bn. It has 60 UK sites and 39 overseas, employing 120,000. BAE is headed by chairman Richard Evans and chief executive John Weston. Thales French defence group Thomson CSF recently renamed itself Thales after the Greek philosopher. Headed by Denis Ranque, it is the second-largest defence contractor in the UK, where operations are headed by Richard Moon. It has 14,500 UK employees, most of whom it acquired when it bought Racal, the UK defence electronics group, for \u00a31.3bn in 2000. The company's origins go back to 1892, with a Franco-American venture to develop electrical processes, which accounted for the English name. It grew into the electronics group Thomson CSF in the 1960s. It was nationalised in 1982. In 1989 Thales bought the defence electronics arm of Dutch company Philips, and in 1997 it was privatised. In June last year Thales completed the Racal merger and divided into three groups: defence, aerospace and IT services. Thales employs 65,000 people worldwide, with sales of \u20ac6.9bn (\u00a34.6bn) and a \u20ac15.4bn order book. Vosper Thorneycroft Compared with BAE and Thales, shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft is a tiddler. Based in Southampton, it has supplied 270 warships to 34 countries over the past 30 years. It is headed by chairman and chief executive Martin Jay. It is a pure shipbuilder/designer with capabilities to produce control systems. VT's 2000 turnover was \u00a3274m, with pre-tax profits of \u00a334m. It employs some 1,300. Raytheon One of the top four US defence contractors, Raytheon was founded in 1922, and its origins lay in making radio tubes. It went on to develop the first guided missiles and microwaves. By the Sixties, it was heavily defence-based, with 80 per cent of revenues from the US government. In the Sixties it expanded by acquisition into commercial marine electronics, publishing and oils and gas seismography. Now, under chairman Daniel Burnham, it focuses on defence, and commercial electronics - including missile, surveillance and reconnaissance, satellite and simulator systems. It employs 100,000. Its 1999 sales were $14.5bn (\u00a310bn), with an order book of $28.4bn.",

The entertainment business has a long, and often noble, tradition of alms-trading, in which good deeds have been profitably exchanged for good publicity. For many years, in this country at least, it was largely a passive and understated transaction that amounted to a few pro-am golf tournaments, Variety Club buses for the handicapped, and the occasional appeal from Bruce Forsyth or Hattie Jacques. </p> <p>All of that changed in the 1980s when Bob Geldof imported some of the aggressive urgency that has always been a feature of American telethons to galvanise public support for Band Aid and Live Aid. The historic success of those ventures in turn led to Comic Relief, which also has demonstrated an unapologetic willingness to exploit celebrity, by raising profiles to raise funds. </p> <p>Up until now, any misgivings or reservations that cynics might have harboured about certain aspects of Comic Relief have remained largely unspoken. And there have been misgivings. Specifically, of course, Lenny Henry. Also the juvenile tone of 'say pants to poverty' badgering. But on a more general note, comedy can have no higher agenda than being funny, at least not if it wants to be comedy. And while not being funny has proven to be an irritatingly small impediment to the careers of most British comedians, it can be doubly irritating to see them hide their lack of talent behind a false red nose. Yet not much has been said for the very good reason that if money is going to worthy causes, then any criticism would be in the most literal sense uncharitable, not to say churlish. </p> <p>But that was before <strong> Celebrity Big Brother</strong>. Now all bets are off and no holds are barred. We who have suffered - and my toes still ache from curling - can remain silent no longer. OK, nobody was expecting a programme that contained Vanessa Feltz and Anthea Turner to be a life-enhancing triumph. However, it's hard to recall a more deathly televisual experience than the nightly offerings of last week. It was as if that excruciating moment when a comedian dies on stage had been stretched out to last for days. Without a script, no one had anything to say of even fleeting interest. It was like prolonged ad libbing, only without the ad libs. </p> <p>The concept was misconceived from the start. The key to the appeal of the original Big Brother lay in the transformation of private people to public property, anonymous contestants who were desperate to become celebrities. </p> <p>In Celebrity Big Brother there were merely desperate celebrities: Feltz, Turner, Keith Duffy (apparently of Boyzone), Jack Dee, Chris Eubank, and Claire Sweeney (from Brookside). No change, no drama, no development. There wasn't even the voyeuristic thrill of gaining a peep into the inner lives of the famous. In part, because so minor was the contestants' fame that it generated negligible curiosity. But also because Feltz and Turner long ago nationalised themselves and placed their emotional utilities in public control. These are people about whose affairs and diets and breakdowns we already know far too much. Which is, no doubt, why they ended up here. </p> <p>With its high walls and security guards, the Big Brother house really does have the feel of a refuge - a refuge for clapped-out celebrities. Forget the Priory, this is where you come when all else is lost, a home for last-chance entertainers. And charity, as we know, begins at home. </p> <p>During her brief stay, Feltz did not stop reminding the audience that her confinement in the house was in aid of a good cause. Just as the audience could not stop thinking that the cause was Feltz's crumbling career. </p> <p>Of the other contestants, all you had to know was this: Chris Eubank, the preening narcissist and absurd poseur, was easily the most charming. He rightly argued that the group allowance should not be spent on alcohol. 'Your drinking has given you an escape route,' he complained. As they were even less amusing drunk, surely they had a responsibility to endure the torture, like the rest of us, in agonising sobriety. </p> <p>It was only really Dee who attempted humour (while Turner maintained an incessant giggle as a kind of soundtrack of determined niceness). Dee's role was inevitably that of the group cynic, but, like a rebel at a Church meeting, he was seldom convincing. Had he been genuinely barbed, rather than launching pantomime escape bids, then perhaps he could have been funny. </p> <p>In truth, very few of the participants sheltering under the expanding umbrella of Comic Relief manage that. Instead, the protection of the red nose tends to have the opposite effect. Like the bore who informs you that he's going to tell you a funny story, it heightens anxiety by providing you with a sort of moral obligation to laugh. But rarely does it then follow through with comic relief. </p> <p>Why ask questions, though, when the money's coming in? That, at least, was the attitude of the investment analysts who helped inflate the value of dotcom shares. The Money Programme 's <strong>The Great Dot Con</strong> traced the rise and fall of the e-commerce from 1994 to the present. It all started with Amazon.com, the internet bookshop launched by Jeff Bezos. </p> <p>Bezos, an intense man with the unearthly countenance of someone who has spent many intimate moments with a computer screen, recalled the giddy days of the mid-to-late Nineties. </p> <p>'We were growing so rapidly we really didn't have many hours in the day to be excited.' You could imagine him entering the words, 'Remember to be excited' in his palm pilot. </p> <p>Plenty of other people were more actively animated, not least the investment analysts recommending that investors buy into dotcom companies. Like the so-called independent financial advisors who flogged dodgy endowments in the Eighties and Nineties, because they were on a percentage from the mortgage companies, the analysts were also paid by the banks to market the dotcoms. </p> <p>All the same, the programme-makers erred in assuming that if they found a victim - a 71-year-old who had lost his life savings in the dotcom crash - there must have been a crime. The fact is that people, including the 71-year-old, invested in dotcoms because they thought they were going to make a lot of quick money. Even I, a man who can't deal with a bank statement, knew that a crash was coming. The reason people carried on buying, and the analysts encouraged them, is what's called 'mug theory' - i.e. they always thought there would be a bigger mug to sell to. </p> <p>If internet businesses had ever coined money with the speed and imagination that they coined new phrases, there would be no talk of economic crisis. </p> <p>Among other neologisms quoted in the programme were 'burn-rate', to describe the speed at which dotcoms got through cash, and my favourite, the 'fear and greed dynamic', which governs the urge to hold on or sell. </p> <p>As it stands, the internet, for all its untapped promise, has succeeded only in selling sex. Going into e-commerce at the moment and not going into sex is like drilling in a well-stocked oil field for something other than oil. That is a lesson that 17-year-old Benjamin Cohen, the subject of <strong> Trouble At The Top</strong>, did not have to learn. </p> <p>Having made a name, and a notional \u00a35 million business, by setting up a website called SoJewish, the schoolboy entrepreneur branched out into pornography with the backing of his prim but proud parents. </p> <p>'Money has no morality,' Ben told a doubting friend, and you just knew this kid could recite every Gordon Gekko speech in Wall Street. Ultimately it was a frustrating documentary that largely reinforced the myths that surround the internet. We never found out what it was that Ben actually did, apart from lie around on the floor in jeans and a baseball shirt, saying things like: 'I'm not the moral guardian of society. I'm just a businessman.' </p> <p>At the end of the film, we saw him suddenly concerned that his shirt was a little wonky. 'I'm sorry,' he explained to his sidekick, 'but I'm a celebrity now.' </p> <p>Yes, here was a boy who had said pants to poverty. And crotchless knickers, too. </p> <p>Finally a note of geographical interest. If you come out of the BBC studios in White City and drive north, the first place you come to is Harlesden. If you drive east, the first place you come to is Paddington. On Tuesday night, BBC2 showed Heart of Harlesden and 15 minutes after that finished, BBC1 screened Paddington Green. Let's hope that Acton (west) and Shepherd's Bush (south) soon receive the docudrama coverage they so richly deserve. </p> <p> Red faces and red noses: Barbara Ellen, Life page 3</p>",

He's now a vague, somewhat clownish figure for those who remember his years in power and those born since then. He said he would bury us, then he himself was buried alive in the Soviet tradition. But history is likely to be moderately kind to him for his role in the denunciation of Stalin and for his sanity during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In both this week's large-scale historical movies, Khrushchev plays a major part. In one he's an unseen player in a diplomatic poker game during the Cold War where a wrongly played hand might have meant the end of the world. In the other he's prominently on stage as a political commissar at a crucial juncture of World War II. </p> <p>The film in which he does not appear is by some considerable way the better of the two. Roger Donaldson's <strong> Thirteen Days</strong> is an engrossing docu-drama relating blow by blow the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 when Soviet recklessness in testing the resolve of Jack Kennedy's government after the Bay of Pigs and the Berlin Wall nearly precipitated a third world war. This is Dr Strangelove without the black humour and with a happy outcome, a film that seeks to rehabilitate the Kennedy brothers as inspired, idealistic leaders, and to get behind recent historical revisionism. </p> <p>Virtually all the characters, from Jack and Bobby Kennedy (convincingly played by Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp) to Major Rudolph Anderson, the U-2 pilot killed in a reconnaissance flight over Cuba, are real figures. As is the man from whose point of view the events are seen - Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), the President's special assistant. </p> <p>O'Donnell was a longtime Kennedy family friend, a Harvard sports star, an Eighth Air Force bombardier with 30 missions to his credit, and a member of the so-called Boston Irish Mafia, whose room at the White House opened directly onto the Oval Office. A Kennedy devotee who yet managed to be a frank counsellor, he wasn't exactly a nonentity, but he wasn't a key decision maker either, so he's someone we can identify with. Costner makes him a plausibly concerned observer, though he comes over as something more ordinary than the real life O'Donnell (he died in 1977 while still in his fifties) of whom Arthur Schlesinger remarked in his chronicle of the Kennedy White House, The 1000 Days, that he 'looked like one of the young IRA men in trenchcoats in John Ford's The Informer and had a grim, cryptic wit which could be devastating'. </p> <p>The film shows the Kennedy brothers growing day by day during the crisis as they respond to events in Cuba, fence with devious Soviet diplomats, and fight off sabre-rattling cold warriors in the Pentagon and in Congress who advise a pre-emptive strike rather than a peaceful quarantine. The contemptuous attitude of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stopping just this side of sedition, explains why Jack Kennedy was so helpful in the making of John Frankenheimer's thriller, Seven Days in May, about an attempted military coup against a liberal President. Sensibly, the movie deliberately avoids anything smacking of triumphalism. </p> <p>Missing from the picture is any sense of what the crisis led to - apart from the American promise never to invade Cuba or destabilise Castro. Also absent, presumably for reasons of time, are the diplomatic efforts to obtain the support of Macmillan, DeGaulle and other free world leaders, as well as the reactions of critics from outside government. </p> <p>One notable aspect of Thirteen Days is the role of women in the early Sixties. They're there to watch and wait, like the mother of O'Donnell's five children and Jackie Kennedy, who appears on screen only to be rebuked by O'Donnell for trying to invite politically uninfluential people to a party. The nearest woman to power is Kennedy's secretary Evelyn Lincoln, who does a lot of typing, but there isn't a woman 'in the loop' - to employ a phrase they use in the movie though it was not, I think, current back in 1962. </p> <p>According to Khrushchev's memoirs, Stalin regularly showed contraband American films to specially invited audiences in the Kremlin. 'He liked cowboy movies especially,' Khrushchev recalled. 'He used to curse them and give them the proper ideological evaluation but then immediately order new ones.' He would therefore have been torn apart by Jean-Jacques Annaud's <strong> Enemy at the Gates</strong> which is in effect the western Shane (released the year Stalin died) superimposed on the 1942 battle for Stalingrad. </p> <p> Enemy at the Gates has a devastating opening 20 minutes as an ill-equipped, inexperienced infantry battalion is dragged off a train, transported across the Volga under heavy German fire and thrown into the fray. Any soldier jumping into the river is immediately shot by the political officers, who shortly thereafter machine-gun any Soviet troops who retreat in the face of overwhelming enemy fire in the hellish, shattered Stalingrad. Then in comes Stalin's emissary Khrushchev (a prosthetically enhanced Bob Hoskins) to compel the commanding Russian general to commit suicide to encourage the others. Never has the word comrade been used so often and meant so little. </p> <p>Thereafter matters of strategy and leadership are largely ignored on both sides in this movie made in a German studio by French film-makers with British and American actors in the leading roles, speaking in a variety of accents. Like a dime novelist turning a western gunfighter into a legendary figure, the political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), chief writer for the Red Army newspaper, transforms the ace sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a semi-literate shepherd boy, into a morale-boosting national hero. Vassili was indeed a real soldier and a brilliant shot whom the Soviet authorities aggrandised to personalise the war. What is pure myth, however, is that to counter him, the German invaders brought in Major Konig (Ed Harris), the suave head of the Wehrmacht's sniper training school. Like Wilson, the gunman played by Jack Palance in Shane, Konig arrives in grand style and wearing black gloves. The encounter between Vassili and Konig is characterised by Danilov as 'the essence of the class struggle' - the marksmen as Marxmen, as it were. </p> <p>There are some exciting shoot-outs between the pair in the stylised rubble of Stalingrad but there are also endless longueurs. Several of the latter involve a Jewish girl soldier (Rachel Weisz) who helps create a half-hearted triangular affair between Danilov, who's also a Jew, and Vassili, the sniper from the Urals with the Estuary accent. As always, Ed Harris enlivens every scene in which he appears. </p> <p>Written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, <strong> Malena</strong> is - like his most celebrated picture Nuovo Cinema Paradiso - a lyrical, nostalgic, deeply sentimental coming-of-age story set in his native Sicily. The movie begins in 1941 on the day Il Duce declares war on Britain and France and the 13-year-old Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro) gets his first bike. It's also the day that the beautiful Malena Scordia (Monica Bellucci), wife of an army officer serving abroad, struts her stuff though the small town of Castelcuto in a tight white dress, causing male groins to twitch lustfully and female tongues to wag enviously. </p> <p>To the strains of a lush Ennio Morricone score, Renato develops an obsessional love for Malena, spying on her, stealing her knickers, masturbating as he imagines playing opposite her in movies as Tarzan, a gladiator, a blind suitor. His parents take him to a doctor, a priest, an exorcist and a brothel in their attempts to cure him. The German troops come and go, the Americans arrive to the strains of 'In the Mood', Malena is punished as a Nazi collaborator by the vindictive, guilt-ridden townsfolk, but still Renato's love goes on. </p> <p>This sort of tale was told better, though not especially well, in Robert Mulligan's Summer of 42, about an American teenager fixated on a lovely war widow in World War II. That too had a swooningly romantic, Oscar-nominated score - by Michel Legrand. If Morricone gets an Oscar next Sunday for this movie it will be to make up for the statuette he ought to have won for Once Upon a Time in the West or The Mission. </p> <p>In Miike Takashi's <strong> Audition</strong>, an odd cross between Misery and Ai No Corrida, a Japanese widower in search of a young bride conspires with a movie-producer chum to stage fake auditions for a film about an affair between a dancer and a Down's syndrome boy. The mysterious girl he selects for her beauty, passivity and intelligence turns out to be the stuff of nightmares rather than dreams. But is she a sadistic serial killer seeking revenge for an abusive childhood or is she the fantasy projection of the widower's guilty feelings? Either way the picture, which for much of its way is an intriguing thriller, culminates in a peculiarly repellent torture scene calculated to make audiences flinch, shut their eyes or make for the exit.</p>",

He's now a vague, somewhat clownish figure for those who remember his years in power and those born since then. He said he would bury us, then he himself was buried alive in the Soviet tradition. But history is likely to be moderately kind to him for his role in the denunciation of Stalin and for his sanity during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. In both this week's large-scale historical movies, Khrushchev plays a major part. In one he's an unseen player in a diplomatic poker game during the Cold War where a wrongly played hand might have meant the end of the world. In the other he's prominently on stage as a political commissar at a crucial juncture of World War II. The film in which he does not appear is by some considerable way the better of the two.

      "body": "<p><strong> Lexus RX300 SE</strong><br> <strong> Price </strong> \u00a332,550 <br> <strong>Insurance group </strong> 15E <br> <strong>MPG </strong> 21.7 <br> <strong>Engine size </strong> 2995cc <br> <strong>Max speed </strong> 112mph <br> <strong>0-62mph</strong> 9.2 seconds <br> <strong>Driven wheels </strong> 4<br> </p> <p>It's dark and we're lost. Really lost. 'In 50 metres, turn left, and continue along this road for 200 metres,' commands the lady in the the dashboard, silkily enunciating her 't's; and, naturally, we obey. Well, I say 'we' do, but in fact, as I can't drive (I much prefer being chauffeured around and being shielded from road rage - my own), the husband is at the wheel, and he's thrilled to turn left, primarily because the 15-year-old Rustbucket left behind at home is seriously short on power-steering. The Lexus crunches down a very narrow, very dark road. Ahead of us, the moon, which is wrapped in shreds of cloud like a yolk in albumen, suddenly gleams off the sea. Can this be right? Wumph! The Lexus abruptly drops a foot. Water flies up over the windscreen. There is a scream which might have come from me. </p> <p>'Are you sure this is the right way?' I ask a moment later, not meaning to be annoying, while hammering away at the 'Voice' button on the dashboard (more polished dark wood than a Victorian parlour). The lady in the DVD Lexus Navigator system speaks again: calm, authoritative, and evidently not in full possession of the facts. 'Continue on this road for 100 metres. Your destination is on your right,' she says as water sluices over the windows. Wumph! Wumph! Is this really a road, or are we journeying along the bottom of the English Channel? We assume that we are driving out to sea on a jetty, and are debating how we're going to reverse the RX300 back on to dry land when the lights of the hotel appear, twinkling away just ahead of us. </p> <p>In her wisdom, the lady in the dash has chosen to send us to the hotel via an unmapped shortcut, down the very road - a coastal strip of knackered tarmac poured over railway sleepers, just after torrential rainstorms and high tide - which would best showcase the 4x4 we'd borrowed for the weekend. Were it not for the extraordinary springs (suspension, I believe the experts call 'em), we'd be mashed all over the the ceiling by now. 'Wow,' breathes my husband, pulling up at our destination and regretfully switching off the engine. Comparisons with my map-reading skills are certainly being drawn, so I point out that, unlike the Navigator system, I don't cost \u00a32,340 (including VAT). </p> <p>As a passenger, I know what I want in a car. I want a heater that doesn't smell of tandoori, a functioning radio and an engine that can actually accelerate up hills. And that's about it. The Lexus RX300 SE fits the bill on this and many other counts. As well as an on-board computer with insider knowledge of every rope bridge and high wire in the kingdom, it also comes equipped with ivory leather seats, a moon roof (which looks very much like a sun roof), a boot the size of Rutland, a six-disc CD player, lushly impractical cream carpet in the footwell, and more cupholders than a very thirsty octopus could shake a bendy straw at. </p> <p>Knowledgeable types explain that the Lexus RX300 is a curious hybrid of off-roader and people-carrier - and yes, I can see that it doesn't look much like either a box or a balloon. To me, it looks like a big, tall, curvy, muscular way of spending \u00a332,550. You step up into it, fill your lungs with Essence of Bond Street Handbag Shop, and find yourself being eyeballed by cabbies and truckers. They aren't the only people who are interested. A kid on our street pointed the RX300 out to his mum, and the chap in the Lexus saloon next to us on the motorway was so fascinated that he kept veering into our lane. He vroomed off in disgust when it became apparent that we didn't know the secret sign that Lexus owners make to each other. (If 2CV owners give each other cheery proley waves, perhaps Lexus drivers flex imaginary plastic between their thumb and index fingers?) </p> <p>In fact, the leathery smell is a little overpowering when you're locked in with it, with warm air pouring out of the heaters. But there is a solution. When the next day dawned crisp and sunny, we found that nothing could be nicer than driving around with the moon roof wide open and the button that controls the seat temperature switched right up to 'hot'. Cold face, toasty body: perfect. The seats are in fact so adjustable - seesawing this way and that, with lumbar rolls popping out and shrinking away at the touch of a button - that there is a temptation to ride them as John Travolta rode his mechanical rodeo bull in Urban Cowboy . Indeed, you can busy yourself with the three buttons that electronically control the angles of your seat - all the way from Hepplewhite to Business Class slumber-pod - and find that a quarter of an hour has slipped by. I mean, you might be the sort of person who'd choose to occupy 15 minutes in that way. Not that we had time to waste like that, or anything.</p> <p>The shingle and floods around Romney Marsh were bread and milk for the Lexus.

      "bodyText": "Lexus RX300 SE Price \u00a332,550 Insurance group 15E MPG 21.7 Engine size 2995cc Max speed 112mph 0-62mph 9.2 seconds Driven wheels 4 It's dark and we're lost. Really lost. 'In 50 metres, turn left, and continue along this road for 200 metres,' commands the lady in the the dashboard, silkily enunciating her 't's; and, naturally, we obey. Well, I say 'we' do, but in fact, as I can't drive (I much prefer being chauffeured around and being shielded from road rage - my own), the husband is at the wheel, and he's thrilled to turn left, primarily because the 15-year-old Rustbucket left behind at home is seriously short on power-steering. The Lexus crunches down a very narrow, very dark road. Ahead of us, the moon, which is wrapped in shreds of cloud like a yolk in albumen, suddenly gleams off the sea. Can this be right? Wumph! The Lexus abruptly drops a foot. Water flies up over the windscreen. There is a scream which might have come from me. 'Are you sure this is the right way?' I ask a moment later, not meaning to be annoying, while hammering away at the 'Voice' button on the dashboard (more polished dark wood than a Victorian parlour). The lady in the DVD Lexus Navigator system speaks again: calm, authoritative, and evidently not in full possession of the facts. 'Continue on this road for 100 metres. Your destination is on your right,' she says as water sluices over the windows. Wumph! Wumph! Is this really a road, or are we journeying along the bottom of the English Channel? We assume that we are driving out to sea on a jetty, and are debating how we're going to reverse the RX300 back on to dry land when the lights of the hotel appear, twinkling away just ahead of us. In her wisdom, the lady in the dash has chosen to send us to the hotel via an unmapped shortcut, down the very road - a coastal strip of knackered tarmac poured over railway sleepers, just after torrential rainstorms and high tide - which would best showcase the 4x4 we'd borrowed for the weekend. Were it not for the extraordinary springs (suspension, I believe the experts call 'em), we'd be mashed all over the the ceiling by now. 'Wow,' breathes my husband, pulling up at our destination and regretfully switching off the engine. Comparisons with my map-reading skills are certainly being drawn, so I point out that, unlike the Navigator system, I don't cost \u00a32,340 (including VAT). As a passenger, I know what I want in a car. I want a heater that doesn't smell of tandoori, a functioning radio and an engine that can actually accelerate up hills. And that's about it. The Lexus RX300 SE fits the bill on this and many other counts. As well as an on-board computer with insider knowledge of every rope bridge and high wire in the kingdom, it also comes equipped with ivory leather seats, a moon roof (which looks very much like a sun roof), a boot the size of Rutland, a six-disc CD player, lushly impractical cream carpet in the footwell, and more cupholders than a very thirsty octopus could shake a bendy straw at. Knowledgeable types explain that the Lexus RX300 is a curious hybrid of off-roader and people-carrier - and yes, I can see that it doesn't look much like either a box or a balloon. To me, it looks like a big, tall, curvy, muscular way of spending \u00a332,550. You step up into it, fill your lungs with Essence of Bond Street Handbag Shop, and find yourself being eyeballed by cabbies and truckers. They aren't the only people who are interested. A kid on our street pointed the RX300 out to his mum, and the chap in the Lexus saloon next to us on the motorway was so fascinated that he kept veering into our lane. He vroomed off in disgust when it became apparent that we didn't know the secret sign that Lexus owners make to each other. (If 2CV owners give each other cheery proley waves, perhaps Lexus drivers flex imaginary plastic between their thumb and index fingers?) In fact, the leathery smell is a little overpowering when you're locked in with it, with warm air pouring out of the heaters. But there is a solution. When the next day dawned crisp and sunny, we found that nothing could be nicer than driving around with the moon roof wide open and the button that controls the seat temperature switched right up to 'hot'. Cold face, toasty body: perfect. The seats are in fact so adjustable - seesawing this way and that, with lumbar rolls popping out and shrinking away at the touch of a button - that there is a temptation to ride them as John Travolta rode his mechanical rodeo bull in Urban Cowboy . Indeed, you can busy yourself with the three buttons that electronically control the angles of your seat - all the way from Hepplewhite to Business Class slumber-pod - and find that a quarter of an hour has slipped by. I mean, you might be the sort of person who'd choose to occupy 15 minutes in that way. Not that we had time to waste like that, or anything. The shingle and floods around Romney Marsh were bread and milk for the Lexus. It ate up the steepest dunes, muddiest roads and deepest fords we could find. The husband heaved little sighs whenever the lights turned green, murmuring about 'confident acceleration' - something the Rustbucket said goodbye to a decade ago. Since we've got into the habit of always building an extra 20 minutes into journeys, to make sure the Rustbucket has enough time to start, we found ourselves arriving everywhere early, which gave us the opportunity to fiddle around some more with the seats - I mean, really familiarise ourselves with the Romney Marsh churches.

      "body": "<p>A few months ago, I received a strange postcard from home. It looked, at first glance, like one of those composite images of an impossibly Oirish Ireland, all green hills, blooming flowers and blue skies. Except that it had the words 'Castles of the Border' across the centre and, on closer inspection, the blossoms foregrounded snapshots of four British army hill forts, those foreboding watchtowers that loom ominously above the border lands around south Armagh. On the postcard, though, set in these impossibly idealised settings, they looked almost quaint.</p> <p>This piece of art provocation, it turned out, came from a mysterious individual called John Byrne, a Belfast-born artist whose latest incarnation is The Border Worrier. Byrne has chosen the Irish border, literally and metaphorically, as the locus for all his anxieties and obsessions about his divided self, as the starting point for an often surreal investigation of his Northern Irishness. He is, as artists tend to be, a true obsessive. Recently, for a month, he created a mock Border Interpretive Centre in a breeze-block hut on a layby between Newry and Dundalk, where the actual border invisibly bisects the main road from the north to the south of the island. He had a local comedian open the centre, sold sticks of border rock and held various exhibitions of border paraphernalia, including bags of soil and various examples of border litter - discarded crisp packets and the like.</p> <p>Byrne's work is slightly mad but strangely instructive: art that questions our assumptions about, among other things, the theme-park Ireland pushed by the burgeoning heritage industry, the divided Ireland of Republican mythology, and the abiding absurdity of this amorphous, meandering line on the landscape that most of us give little thought to any more, but which, as recent history attests, means so much.</p> <p>Last week, I received another surreal image in the post - a photograph of a Kalashnikov rifle, the weapon of choice for terrorists/freedom fighters the world over, and a gun whose urgent retort I probably heard as an adolescent growing up on a Republican housing estate in Armagh. (There were even some local youths who claimed to be able to tell the difference between the Armalites and Kalashnikovs used by the Provisional IRA, and the SLR used by the British army, just by the sound they made.) This particular Kalashnikov, though, was made of chocolate. It had been cast and moulded, actual size, from the real thing by Belfast-based artist Rita Duffy (who, unsurprisingly, is remaining mysteriously tight-lipped about her sources). It is a quintessentially Northern Irish art piece that again manages to be simultaneously surreal and deadly serious, darkly humorous and deeply disturbing. (The chocolate, by the way, was made in Portadown, though it is not, as far as I know, orange-flavoured.)</p> <p>The chocolate AK47, entitled simply 'Dessert', has been commissioned - though decommissioned might be a better word here - by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London for an event I am curating there next weekend called Belfast: Are We Nearly There? In it, various writers, artists, photographers, comedians and performers (including John Byrne) from Northern Ireland will be addressing issues that have arisen out of the end of the Troubles; and even saying those last five words, I feel like I am tempting fate.</p> <p>The event is a wide-ranging, even fragmented one which, no doubt, will manage to offend someone, somewhere along the way. If it has an underlying theme, it is this: as the fragile and uneasy peace just about endures, and as the various reinventions of Northern Ireland, and Belfast in particular, continue at an often startling pace, one remarkably unvoiced question endures: what are we going to do with the Troubles? By that, I mean, what are those of us who lived through them going to do with their legacy, with the bottomless well of damage, suspicion, grief, loss and anger that still lingers in their wake? What are we going to do with our experience, our memory - collective and individual - of the conflict, our fractured sense of our selves? Can we simply, as some people (usually on this side of the Irish Sea) suggest, let it be? I, for one, think not, hope not.</p> <p>The Troubles, though they may be over, continue, to various extents, to define those of us who lived through them, and however much we may wish it otherwise, that is exactly as it should be. For myself, I have been both deeply affected, and relatively untouched by the Troubles. I have lost people I knew, but no family members nor close friends have died as a direct result of the conflict. I have grown up with that conflict as a constant, but have emerged relatively unscathed, not bitter nor even regretful that I was pitched headlong, through an accident of birth, into such murderous times. I have even, it has to be said, some good memories of the Troubles - the exhilaration, the sense of liberation that the early civil rights movement inspired in my generation, the thrill of those early protests and even those early riots.</p> <p>And, it almost goes without saying, I also carry some some dark and disturbing images in my head, immovable, inescapable, unprocessable. But as time passes and the Troubles recede into history, I realise that, ultimately, I was one of the lucky ones. I felt this most profoundly when I read a book called Lost Lives, an objective, dispassionate chronicle of every death in the Troubles, and thus the single most powerful testimony to yet emerge from those murderous times.</p> <p>Reading Lost Lives, complied by journalist David McKittrick and others, awakened something deep inside me; something repressed, buried, pushed for a long time way down beyond rational understanding, never mind articulation. I could call it anger, but that's too small and specific a word. It was more like an angry sadness or, to borrow a phase used recently by the young London-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, a kind of 'pacifist rage'.</p> <p>For a while, I was angry about virtually every aspect of the Troubles: about the crimes against human life committed in the name of absolute, and exclusive, causes; at the dirty war waged by successive British governments and their army; at the cavalier approach to human life, not just by terrorists but by elected bodies operating within, and with total disregard for democracy. Mostly, though, I was angry that the Troubles had to happen at all, that they were allowed to grow so big and monstrous yet be, in the main, so contained and localised.</p> <p>I hear and feel that same anger in many people who lived through the Troubles. And as the dust settles, that well of anger seems to rise. I hear it articulated most forcefully by those who have lost relatives or friends, and by those who have suddenly been confronted with the full force of their history by even the most cursory reading of Lost Lives. What that anger seems to be saying is: it would not have been allowed to happen anywhere else on these islands.</p> <p>Anger, though - untrammelled and unfocused - is self-defeating, as pointless and self-negating, in its way, as guilt. It needs to be transformed, turned into something positive, life-affirming. Which is what next week's event at the ICA is also about. John Byrne's obsessive and often disturbingly funny laying bare of the border within himself, like Rita Duffy's chocolate AK47, or comedian Michael Smiley's autobiographical oral memoir, entitled - wait for it - Confessions of a Catholic Buddhist, may seem like a perverse way of confronting the long shadow of the Troubles, but it makes perfect absurdist sense to me. That it sits, perhaps uneasily, alongside utterly serious debates featuring writers like Tom Paulin and Ronan Bennett, the award-winning Irish journalist Susan McKay and the maverick Unionist politician David Ervine, seems also to somehow refect the seriousness and the oft-overlooked surrealism of everyday life in a still troubled state.</p> <p>Walking through Belfast recently, I was struck by the sudden awful thought that, with the Troubles gone, the city seemed suspended - despite all the redevelopment and attempted reinvention - in a strange limbo, not really knowing what to do with itself, how else to assert its difference. It occurred to me that peace might succeed in doing what 30-odd years of war failed to do, and steal Belfast's soul. As if on cue, I came across the following statement by Northern Irish poet and Arts Council representative Damian Smyth: 'There is no such thing as cultural politics. It's just politics. In Northern Ireland, political ideology invests every manifestation of social, intellectual, popular and even spiritual life. And none of that is a \"bad\" thing. In fact, it is a good thing, and we should never lose it.'</p> <p>I think I know what he means. Next week at the ICA, that temple of cosmopolitan twenty-first century post-modernism, the truth of those words will hopefully emerge in the most positive, self-questioning, funny, fragmented, obsessive, and occasionally surreal way. As a friend from home remarked recently, the problem with the title, Are We Nearly There?, is that 'with Northern Irish people in attendance, you'll not only have to debate the meaning of the word \"we\" but the meaning of the word \"there\"'. He was laughing, but I don't think he was joking. We'll see\u0085</p> <p>Belfast: Are We Nearly There? runs from Friday 23 to Sunday 25 March at the ICA, The Mall, London SW1. John Byrne performs at 4.30pm on Sunday. Tickets and information 0207 930 3647 or at www.ica.org.uk</p>",

After intense gunfire, the kidnappers fled and the men were bundled into an army helicopter and flown to safety.</p> <p>After being held for more than a month deep in the remote Chittagong hills, the three had been marched for six hours through dense teak and banana forests before being dumped in a hut on Friday night. Soldiers encircled the village at 6am yesterday.</p> <p>They used loud-hailers to urge the kidnappers, who had already melted away, to surrender. They then fired several shots into the air. 'There were three huts. We found the hostages in one of the huts. They appeared panicked,' Brigadier Golam Rabbani said. 'The gunmen pushed us to our limits,' he added. Last night, however, sources said they suspected the hostages had been freed only after a large ransom had been paid.</p> <p>The bandits, who seized the Europeans on 16 February while they were carrying out a road-surveying project, had originally demanded $1.8 million. The kidnapped men's employer, the Danish construction firm Kampsax, had beaten the price down to \u00a3100,000, sources had suggested last week.</p> <p>Selby, 28, whose family lives in Oldham, Greater Manchester, last night appeared to be unscathed by his ordeal. 'He is in pretty good shape physically. He has been chatting today. He is not ill,' Jon Geddes, spokesman for the British High Commission in Dhaka, said.</p> <p>His father Alf, 61, a retired deputy head, said confirmation of his son's release came after phone calls from the authorities in Bangladesh. 'I didn't have much time to speak to him on the phone and we still don't know exactly what happened.'</p> <p>After celebrating with champagne, his mother, Margaret, 61, said she doubted the experience would deter her son from working abroad. She added: 'This has just made me realise how precious people are. Without the support of all our friends and ex-colleagues, we wouldn't have been able to cope as well as we have. It has been very stressful and, of course, our imaginations were running wild. But the Foreign Office have been very reliable and steady.

      "bodyText": "A British engineer was last night preparing for an emotional homecoming after army commandos stormed the jungle hideout in Bangladesh where he and two colleagues were being held by tribal kidnappers. The soldiers swooped shortly after dawn and found Tim Selby, from Oldham, and two Danes cowering in a bamboo hut. After intense gunfire, the kidnappers fled and the men were bundled into an army helicopter and flown to safety. After being held for more than a month deep in the remote Chittagong hills, the three had been marched for six hours through dense teak and banana forests before being dumped in a hut on Friday night. Soldiers encircled the village at 6am yesterday. They used loud-hailers to urge the kidnappers, who had already melted away, to surrender. They then fired several shots into the air. 'There were three huts. We found the hostages in one of the huts. They appeared panicked,' Brigadier Golam Rabbani said. 'The gunmen pushed us to our limits,' he added. Last night, however, sources said they suspected the hostages had been freed only after a large ransom had been paid. The bandits, who seized the Europeans on 16 February while they were carrying out a road-surveying project, had originally demanded $1.8 million. The kidnapped men's employer, the Danish construction firm Kampsax, had beaten the price down to \u00a3100,000, sources had suggested last week. Selby, 28, whose family lives in Oldham, Greater Manchester, last night appeared to be unscathed by his ordeal. 'He is in pretty good shape physically. He has been chatting today. He is not ill,' Jon Geddes, spokesman for the British High Commission in Dhaka, said. His father Alf, 61, a retired deputy head, said confirmation of his son's release came after phone calls from the authorities in Bangladesh. 'I didn't have much time to speak to him on the phone and we still don't know exactly what happened.' After celebrating with champagne, his mother, Margaret, 61, said she doubted the experience would deter her son from working abroad. She added: 'This has just made me realise how precious people are. Without the support of all our friends and ex-colleagues, we wouldn't have been able to cope as well as we have. It has been very stressful and, of course, our imaginations were running wild. But the Foreign Office have been very reliable and steady. Now I know Tim is in safe hands, my worries and fears have gone and we can just get back to a normal life.' The engineers were flown to the capital, Dhaka, by helicopter. Their shirts and jeans were soaked in sweat, and the three looked exhausted on arrival, but waved to the crowd of diplomats and military officers who greeted them. They were taken to a military hospital for check-ups. Their release came after four weeks of negotiations in which British diplomats had been forced to sit in a wooden hut by the side of a road for much of the time. They had privately complained of a lack of co-operation from the Bangladeshi authorities. Three trained hostage negotiators from Scotland Yard had also flown in to assist. Army officials last night maintained that the 'hunt' was continuing for the kidnappers - even though they were offered an amnesty deal two days ago. They are believed to be members of a dissident tribal faction opposed to a peace accord signed three years ago which ended a long and bloody insurgency in the south-east hill region, 210 miles from Dacca. Yesterday Bangladesh's Prime Minister, Shaikh Hasina, who faces elections in July, welcomed the end to what had become an embarrassment for her government. Selby faces awkward questions on his return - not least, why he and his colleagues failed to take a police escort with them, as they had done on the same stretch of road three days before they were captured. The area is notorious for robberies and kidnappings - and for its casual army checkpoints. Several criminal tribal gangs are based in the hills behind the paddy terraces and Buddhist temples.

Sangakkara speaks English better than the English and the way that he's been accommodating every media request - and there have been plenty of them - there's a fair chance that by the end of this Test he'll be too hoarse to speak, a state of affairs that is unlikely to dismay the English camp. </p> <p>Sangakkara has fascinated us all. Partly this is because he's a damn fine player, as he proved in the cauldron of Kandy when his dashing innings of 95 gave Sri Lanka a glimmer of an unlikely victory. His 45 here in Colombo also hinted at a special talent. But Mahela Jayawardena at this stage is the more accomplished Sri Lankan batsman, verging on greatness, and no one was rushing to speak to him last week. </p> <p>No, what beguiles us is the fact that Sangakkara has been able to get under Mike Atherton's skin in a manner that no other international cricketer has managed throughout Atherton's 12-year Test career. </p> <p>By his own admission, Atherton, normally a beacon of tranquillity, 'lost it for four overs' on that tempestuous third evening in Kandy and Sangakkara was the catalyst for that. Even so this pair, who have much in common, have agreed to have a beer now that the series is over. They may end up as bosom pals but it could take a while.</p> <p>Sangakkara is a great talker. As we - or rather he - was chatting away in Colombo, Dav Whatmore, the coach of Sri Lanka, summoned him for some catching practice. He acknowledged Whatmore with a wave and kept talking for another 15 minutes. This week he has been 'working' the press brilliantly. He has been utterly cooperative, enjoying all the attention, yet as he puts his sharp legal mind to use (he's a second-year law student) he has been careful to say nothing too incriminating or controversial. </p> <p>At the tender age of 23 you sense he could take over Alistair Campbell's job at Millbank tomorrow. Maybe this is what grates with Atherton. He's used to basic sledging from behind the stumps. Usually he responds with haughty indifference. Famously at Sydney on the way to a Test century in 1994 he got an earthy earful from Ian Healy after surviving a fierce and justified appeal. Atherton eventually turned to Healy with a quiet 'When in Rome, old boy.' Healy was nonplussed and confused. </p> <p>Sangakkara, who happened to study classics at A-level at Trinity College in Kandy, would have understood and, I dare say, have responded with alacrity. Like Atherton, Sangakkara is obviously bright. However Atherton would never yield to playing the press game. He was never prepared to woo the hacks. To him this smacked of hypocrisy. Sangakkara currently does it with relish and he's brilliant at it; another reason why Atherton may be wary of him. </p> <p>Since he's so sharp it is optimistic to expect Sangakkara to give us chapter and verse of his exchange with Atherton in Kandy. Instead he says that his provocation of the English players is not intentional. 'There was no plan to annoy or irritate the opposition, though I am aware that I have done so. I'm conscious of the spirit of the game. I recognise that we, the players, are the guardians of the game - most definitely so since there are thousands of people watching. I am competitive but I do accept decisions.' </p> <p>When asked whether he has any regrets about the way he has played in this series, he now has a stock response - 'Yes, that shot against Croft' - a wild drive that denied him his maiden Test century. But there are to be no admissions of overstepping the mark in his behaviour, though he does concede, 'I know it did look ugly out there,' referring to his exchange with Atherton. </p> <p>'The Sri Lankans are determined to be as tough as anyone on the field,' he says. 'We have learnt that since 1995 from Aravinda [de Silva] and Arjuna [Ranatunga]. We have tried to be tough, both mentally and physically, but not dirty. It is nice to have a clean, wonderful game but it does not always work out like that. Sledging is part of the game. As long as it is not vindictive that's OK - and it helps if it's humorous.' </p> <p>He says that Sri Lanka's recent, unsuccessful tour of South Africa taught him a lot: 'Playing there certainly toughened me up. The South Africans are hard, ruthless cricketers, who know how to crush you when you're down.' The Sri Lankans aim to be as ruthless. </p> <p>But Sangakkara is adamant that he would never claim a catch if he knew that he had scooped the ball on the half-volley. He's sure that he caught the ball in England's first innings in Galle when Atherton edged Vaas in his direction (to England's anguish the third umpire was not consulted and this was the spark for the ensuing little feud). But he had no problems with Atherton staying at the crease in Kandy after another edge came his way off Vaas - 'He's perfectly entitled to do that.' In that case the third umpire was consulted and the catch was confirmed. </p> <p>He recognises that he is not the best wicketkeeper in Sri Lanka by a long way. 'Kaluwitharana [whom he has replaced in the Test side] is a better keeper and he helps me a lot.' But his batting prowess has got him the job and at the moment he's happy to continue with both roles, though he has played for Sri Lanka as a pure batsman and is more than capable of holding his own as a specialist. </p> <p>Sangakkara came to cricket 'by accident'. In his youth at Trinity College, in whose grounds the Kandy Test was played, he was an outstanding tennis player. Only at the age of 12 did the cricket coach persuade him to play as a wicketkeeper/batsman. Soon he excelled at under-17 and under-19 level and, like all ambitious players, moved from Kandy to Colombo to advance his cricket. </p> <p>Sangakkara is the youngest offspring of a successful Kandy lawyer and says: 'I almost felt obliged to study law since none of my elder siblings followed my father's profession.' Not that they are malingerers. One is a psychologist and the best woman tennis player in Sri Lanka, another a broker, another in business management. He's now in the second year of what is nominally a four-year law course at the university in Colombo. With his cricketing commitments he's not sure when he will finish this course, but finish it he will. He'd also like to experience county cricket in England - 'a great nursery' - though Sri Lanka's international schedule makes that a tricky proposition for all but Muttiah Muralitharan. </p> <p>Sangakkara will succeed - probably on the cricket field, but, if not, in any other walk of life that he chooses. Once he's calmed down a bit there's every chance that he'll captain his country. In which case those inevitable pre-match press conferences, usually so dreary, will become a minor art form.

      "bodyText": "I interviewed Kumar Sangakkara before the Colombo Test - or did I have an audience with him? Sangakkara speaks English better than the English and the way that he's been accommodating every media request - and there have been plenty of them - there's a fair chance that by the end of this Test he'll be too hoarse to speak, a state of affairs that is unlikely to dismay the English camp. Sangakkara has fascinated us all. Partly this is because he's a damn fine player, as he proved in the cauldron of Kandy when his dashing innings of 95 gave Sri Lanka a glimmer of an unlikely victory. His 45 here in Colombo also hinted at a special talent. But Mahela Jayawardena at this stage is the more accomplished Sri Lankan batsman, verging on greatness, and no one was rushing to speak to him last week. No, what beguiles us is the fact that Sangakkara has been able to get under Mike Atherton's skin in a manner that no other international cricketer has managed throughout Atherton's 12-year Test career. By his own admission, Atherton, normally a beacon of tranquillity, 'lost it for four overs' on that tempestuous third evening in Kandy and Sangakkara was the catalyst for that. Even so this pair, who have much in common, have agreed to have a beer now that the series is over. They may end up as bosom pals but it could take a while. Sangakkara is a great talker.

I loved the eccentricity of the place - the books, pictures and photographs all crowded together in a caravan. The first words she said to me were 'Are you a Papist?' It's typical of her directness. She was so clued-up. The conversation went everywhere. I was just trying to keep up. It's a mystery why she took to me, but I was touched by it. I'd wasted so much time pursuing things that were destructive on all levels. Lilla knows about my past and she accepts it. That's a vital part of our friendship. <p> She asked me where my spirituality came from and it was a relief to talk on that level because people of my age don't. Although I'm not a Papist, there has never been a moment in my life when I didn't believe in God. I loved the imagery and the language of the Old Testament and God making the world cringe - that appealed to me in my twenties when I had so many chips on my shoulder. Lilla says I'm tugging at God's beard in my music. </p> <p> I trust her judgement implicitly. She talks about paintings with the same uncanny understanding she brings to everything else, recognising works by the vibrations they give off. I was once there when a young hopeful came into the gallery with some drawings. Lilla couldn't see them and yet what she said about them was absolutely right. </p> <p> These days I'm happier and more focussed. I have more ideas and get things done. Lilla is very supportive. She knows my work is a spiritual necessity for me and she worries if I'm not doing it. I don't care how many prams there are in the hall, the more the merrier, but sometimes I get so tired I can barely string a sentence together and that bothers her. </p> <p> I have very few close friends and Lilla is the only one I don't actually work with. Lilla and I have a genuine love for each other.</p> <p> We're in constant contact, but I tend to be a bit more erratic than she is - life sometimes gets in the way and I may not call for a month. But it doesn't matter because I know she'll always be there for me. </p> <p><b> IM Birtwistle:</b> I had no idea who Nick was when we first met, but I'm as enthusiastic about his music now as any of his fans. Nick rushes through life like a meteor. He needs to learn to pace himself to avoid burn-out. I love the stretch of his mind and his search for original ideas, although some of his albums definitely need a government health warning. </p> <p> Since the births of his four sons and his marriage, he has become a tremendous patriarch and has moved forward musically. His new album is a poetic offering to his wife Susie that bears comparison with Bart\u00f3k. The imagery ranges from the surreal to the tender, but knowing Nick, you are always on the look-out for the grenade hidden in the bouquet. </p> <p> Although he doesn't subscribe to organised religion, Nick's life is totally God-centred. There are areas of faith, of course, where we can't meet and this is a sadness, almost like a bereavement, because part of that person is lost to you, but Nick has so many layers that I enjoy exploring his landscape. I can't see him, but I have his voice, like a warm, operatic Leonard Cohen, and like Desdemona 'I see his visage in my mind.' </p> <p> I have hereditary glaucoma and started losing my sight when I was 49.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This series in Sri Lanka has probably been the most contentious England have played abroad since my bust-up with Pakistani umpire Shakoor Rana in 1987, giving a timely reminder of how easily things can spiral out of control. </p> <p>At different times in both the first and second Tests the very basics of the game were forgotten or passed over. When that happens and players lose respect for umpires, match officials and each other we are only a short step away from a total breakdown. </p> <p>I have no doubt that the quality of umpiring and refereeing in recent Tests - highlighted by TV - has left a lot to be desired, and ICC chairman Malcolm Gray admitted as much this week when he promised an overhaul of the way Test cricket is run. But it's not just the officials and administrators we must look to: the players also have a duty of care to the game. </p> <p>It was good to see in the run-up to this third Test in Colombo a degree of agreement between the captains to ensure the game was played in a better spirit, but that initiative went out of the window on the first day when Aravinda De Silva was caught at slip - and didn't walk. </p> <p>For the next half-hour you could sense the tension rising again with a few flicks back to the keeper from short-leg to keep De Silva on his toes, and hard looks from the England fielders. In a situation like that players can't heap the responsibility on to the umpire. De Silva isn't a kid. He's been around a long time, captained his country and was well aware of the bad feeling in the series and the attempts to heal relationships - so he nicks one to slip and stands his ground. What was he thinking about? </p> <p>As a batsman, there is an accepted range within which you leave it to the umpire. The opposite end of the spectrum from nicking one to slip and not walking is getting the faintest of edges that the fielding side don't appeal for and giving yourself out. No-one is expected to do that, either. </p> <p>The lead for players' conduct must come from the captain. I've always left it up to my players whether they walk or not on the understanding that if they don't walk they surrender the right to complain when they get a bad decision. The exception to that rule was Pakistan in 1987 when we were getting so many poor decisions we decided as a team to stand our ground, obviously within reason. </p> <p>A captain also has to control the chat that goes on in the middle and the level of appealing, both of which have been unacceptable in this series. A chirpy youngster like Sangakkara should be told to tone it down and the Sri Lankans must learn to restrict their shouts. England haven't been blameless in either area, but they haven't been as bad as their hosts. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the ICC have the power to cut the grounds for dispute by improving standards of umpiring and refereeing. </p> <p>Barrie Stuart-King, the chairman of the Association of Cricket Umpires, made some telling points on these pages last week, calling for more training for umpires and suggesting that former players aren't necessarily the best men for the job. Half right in my opinion. Yes, we do need Test match officials to be better trained but having played the game to a reasonable level is an asset for an umpire. I'm sure the same would be true in football. </p> <p>Former players know what goes on in the game, they have the confidence to give bat-pad decisions, for example, according to the angle and bounce of the ball, and if their judgement is wrong they can always say: 'Come on, lads, we all make mistakes. I don't have a go at you when you get out to a bad shot.' </p> <p>I like Gray's idea of having a pool of eight full-time 'super umpires', at least one of which would stand in every Test played. They should not be selected on grounds of nationality but on their ability. If that means six English umpires, or none, so be it. What we don't need is a nomination from each country for political reasons. </p> <p>The troubled tour of Pakistan in 1987 accelerated the arrival of one neutral official, and perhaps the goings-on in Sri Lanka will provide the impetus for another change. But if the ICC take the logical next step to having two neutral umpires in each match that could actually disadvantage England as the majority of the best officials are English and they would never stand in a home Test. Foreign umpires could also be drafted into county cricket and maybe even Australian grade games because, like players, they will improve with practice. </p> <p>At the same time, the ICC needs to set up a structure for monitoring the performance of officials with de-briefings after each Test on what they did well, and badly. The present system offers very little feedback, never mind censure. If a player is subjected to a post-match trial by video from his coach, why isn't an umpire asked, in private, to account for his mistakes? </p> <p>Hopefully, the introduction of some form of ICC-controlled centralised umpiring system would also lead to more consistency in interpretation of the laws, particularly the lbw law. </p> <p>Why ignore technology when you're trying to maintain concentration for every delivery of a five-day Test and making instant judgements on the path of a ball delivered at 80-90mph? Let's not be frightened of the technology. </p> <p>Unlike my fellow columnist, former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, I don't think we can rein back on TV advances - that would not be helpful. And why protect an umpire who is consistently shown to be giving wrong decisions? </p> <p>The ICC's review should also give serious consideration to Duncan Fletcher's idea of three referrals per innings, whereby teams could challenge an umpire's decision on three occasions if they believed it to be wrong. I worry that these referrals could be used up early in an innings leaving the lower order to suffer any bad decisions later in the day. But the idea has merit. </p> <p>Match refereeing must be addressed. I think Gray referred to them as an old boy network, and that's the problem - they're old, and too often out of touch with the modern game. Someone more recently retired from Test cricket would have a far better understanding of the players' view (and no, I'm not applying for a job). </p> <p>When Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya threw his helmet at an advertising board only the very naive would have expected him to be suspended. Referees have the power but don't use it. Instead they prefer largely meaningless suspended sentences and fines. </p> <p>Players, umpires, referees and the ICC all care for cricket and need to work together to ensure it not only remains a great game, but also a fair and enjoyable one to play.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This series in Sri Lanka has probably been the most contentious England have played abroad since my bust-up with Pakistani umpire Shakoor Rana in 1987, giving a timely reminder of how easily things can spiral out of control. At different times in both the first and second Tests the very basics of the game were forgotten or passed over. When that happens and players lose respect for umpires, match officials and each other we are only a short step away from a total breakdown. I have no doubt that the quality of umpiring and refereeing in recent Tests - highlighted by TV - has left a lot to be desired, and ICC chairman Malcolm Gray admitted as much this week when he promised an overhaul of the way Test cricket is run. But it's not just the officials and administrators we must look to: the players also have a duty of care to the game. It was good to see in the run-up to this third Test in Colombo a degree of agreement between the captains to ensure the game was played in a better spirit, but that initiative went out of the window on the first day when Aravinda De Silva was caught at slip - and didn't walk. For the next half-hour you could sense the tension rising again with a few flicks back to the keeper from short-leg to keep De Silva on his toes, and hard looks from the England fielders. In a situation like that players can't heap the responsibility on to the umpire. De Silva isn't a kid. He's been around a long time, captained his country and was well aware of the bad feeling in the series and the attempts to heal relationships - so he nicks one to slip and stands his ground. What was he thinking about? As a batsman, there is an accepted range within which you leave it to the umpire. The opposite end of the spectrum from nicking one to slip and not walking is getting the faintest of edges that the fielding side don't appeal for and giving yourself out. No-one is expected to do that, either. The lead for players' conduct must come from the captain. I've always left it up to my players whether they walk or not on the understanding that if they don't walk they surrender the right to complain when they get a bad decision. The exception to that rule was Pakistan in 1987 when we were getting so many poor decisions we decided as a team to stand our ground, obviously within reason. A captain also has to control the chat that goes on in the middle and the level of appealing, both of which have been unacceptable in this series. A chirpy youngster like Sangakkara should be told to tone it down and the Sri Lankans must learn to restrict their shouts. England haven't been blameless in either area, but they haven't been as bad as their hosts. Meanwhile, the ICC have the power to cut the grounds for dispute by improving standards of umpiring and refereeing. Barrie Stuart-King, the chairman of the Association of Cricket Umpires, made some telling points on these pages last week, calling for more training for umpires and suggesting that former players aren't necessarily the best men for the job. Half right in my opinion. Yes, we do need Test match officials to be better trained but having played the game to a reasonable level is an asset for an umpire. I'm sure the same would be true in football. Former players know what goes on in the game, they have the confidence to give bat-pad decisions, for example, according to the angle and bounce of the ball, and if their judgement is wrong they can always say: 'Come on, lads, we all make mistakes. I don't have a go at you when you get out to a bad shot.' I like Gray's idea of having a pool of eight full-time 'super umpires', at least one of which would stand in every Test played. They should not be selected on grounds of nationality but on their ability. If that means six English umpires, or none, so be it. What we don't need is a nomination from each country for political reasons. The troubled tour of Pakistan in 1987 accelerated the arrival of one neutral official, and perhaps the goings-on in Sri Lanka will provide the impetus for another change. But if the ICC take the logical next step to having two neutral umpires in each match that could actually disadvantage England as the majority of the best officials are English and they would never stand in a home Test. Foreign umpires could also be drafted into county cricket and maybe even Australian grade games because, like players, they will improve with practice. At the same time, the ICC needs to set up a structure for monitoring the performance of officials with de-briefings after each Test on what they did well, and badly. The present system offers very little feedback, never mind censure. If a player is subjected to a post-match trial by video from his coach, why isn't an umpire asked, in private, to account for his mistakes? Hopefully, the introduction of some form of ICC-controlled centralised umpiring system would also lead to more consistency in interpretation of the laws, particularly the lbw law. Why ignore technology when you're trying to maintain concentration for every delivery of a five-day Test and making instant judgements on the path of a ball delivered at 80-90mph? Let's not be frightened of the technology. Unlike my fellow columnist, former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, I don't think we can rein back on TV advances - that would not be helpful. And why protect an umpire who is consistently shown to be giving wrong decisions? The ICC's review should also give serious consideration to Duncan Fletcher's idea of three referrals per innings, whereby teams could challenge an umpire's decision on three occasions if they believed it to be wrong. I worry that these referrals could be used up early in an innings leaving the lower order to suffer any bad decisions later in the day. But the idea has merit. Match refereeing must be addressed. I think Gray referred to them as an old boy network, and that's the problem - they're old, and too often out of touch with the modern game. Someone more recently retired from Test cricket would have a far better understanding of the players' view (and no, I'm not applying for a job). When Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya threw his helmet at an advertising board only the very naive would have expected him to be suspended. Referees have the power but don't use it. Instead they prefer largely meaningless suspended sentences and fines. Players, umpires, referees and the ICC all care for cricket and need to work together to ensure it not only remains a great game, but also a fair and enjoyable one to play.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Work, Rest and Pay</b> <p><b> Which of the following causes you the most anxiety in life? </b> Money 32% Family 28% Job pressures 18% Time pressures 13% Love life 9%</p> <p><b> If there were two extra hours in the day, would you prefer to spend them ... </b> With family 49% With friends 25% By yourself 17% Getting more work done 9%</p> <p><b> If you had the choice would you prefer to work shorter hours for the same amount of money or the same amount of hours for more money? </b></p> <p>Shorter hours - same money 46% Same hours - more money 54%</p> <p>Money causes the most anxiety in life for 32 per cent. This helps to explain why so many value additional money over free time. Love life causes the least anxiety which, combined with the high levels of confidence in partners' fidelity and the durability of marriage (see below in Love, Sex and Marriage), suggests that we tend to become complacent when we have found a partner. This is reinforced by the evidence that love life is more than three times more likely to be the primary cause of anxiety in the life for singles than those who are married or cohabiting. Money is not the primary source of anxiety for all age groups. Job pressures create more anxiety among 45 to 54-year-olds, while family causes the most anxiety for both the 55-64 and 65+ age groups.</p> <p>The results of the third question appear to contradict the commonly held belief that longer working hours have made us all victim to a \u0095time squeeze\u00ea effect. The other interpretation is that we are willing participants in this time squeeze rather than victims. Among those who work and said that they would like to spend more time with the family 50 per cent would opt for shorter hours while 50 per cent would prefer more money. This suggests that while family matters to this group, its importance could be eclipsed by the pursuit of money. </p> <p><b> On average, how many days work a year do you miss through 'sickies' - feigned illness?</b> Average overall: 3.6 Average for men: 4.4 Average for women: 2.7</p> <p>76 per cent of workers in the UK take at least one sickie per year. In addition to the differences in male and female workers, there is also some regional variation with Northern workers taking an average of 4.27 sickies per year in comparison with 3.4 in the South and 3.09 in the Midlands.</p> <p><b> If money were no object, would you:</b></p> <p>a) <b>Educate your children privately?</b> Yes 61% No 39%</p> <p><b>(b) Take out private healthcare?</b> Yes 76% No 24%</p> <p>Overall, people are in favour of private education and healthcare. The older age groups (55+) appear to have the strongest attachment to the principles of state-supplied education and healthcare. For a significant minority, private healthcare is seen as a necessity while private education provides a moral quandary: 25 per cent of those who would take out private healthcare would refuse to educate their children privately if money were no object. Only 19 per cent of the British population would not take out private healthcare or educate their children privately.</p> <p><b> Love, Sex and Marriage</b></p> <p><b> Are you currently in a relationship?</b> Yes 75% No 25%</p> <p><b> Are you confident that your partner is or has always been faithful to you?</b> Yes 87% No 13%</p> <p><b> If you were to get married today, would you expect to stay married to the same person for the rest of your life?</b> Yes 86% No 14%</p> <p>Other than the very high level of confidence in their partner's fidelity (which could be interpreted as complacency) one of the most interesting statistics is that there is no significant difference between the answers of men and women. There is a continued faith in marriage: 90 per cent of those who are marrie or cohabiting are confident of their partner's fidelity in comparison to 69 per cent of those who are not living with their partner.</p> <p><b> Do you believe that marriage between people of the same sex should be legal?</b> Yes 31% No 69%</p> <p>Men (75 per cent) are more likely to be opposed to same-sex marriage than women (63 per cent). As with the previous question, the older the respondent, the less likely they are to believe that same-sex marriage should be legalised. </p> <p><b> Are you currently satisfied with your sex life?</b> Yes 75% No 25%</p> <p>A quarter of the UK population is currently dissatisfied with their sex life. Furthermore, this dissatisfaction does not appear to be confined to young men. In fact, there is little significant difference between satisfaction levels across the spectrum of age and social class. As for gender, men, perhaps predictably, are less satisfied, but not by much (72 per cent to women's 80 per cent).</p> <p><b> Have you ever paid for sex?</b> Yes 5% No 95%</p> <p>61 per cent of those who have paid for sex have done so only once or twice suggesting that, for the majority, it is a one-off rather than habitual.</p> <p><b> Have you ever been to see a therapist?</b> Yes 14% No 86%</p> <p><b> If so, did you find the therapy sessions helpful?</b> Yes 68% No 32%</p> <p>These results appear to suggest that a stable relationship is the greatest ameliorative for mental turmoil, as 21 per cent of those who are single have been to see a therapist in comparison with 12 per cent of those who are married/living with a partner. There is little difference in tendency to consult a therapist based on social class (which could be used as a crude indicator of wealth). While women (16 per cent) are more likely to have seen a therapist than men (12 per cent), the disparity is not as great as may be expected. Men, it seems, are getting over their traditional reluctance to talk things over.</p> <p><b> What religion are you?</b> Church of England 55% Roman Catholic 16% Other Christian 9% Muslim 1% Hindu 0.3% Jewish 0.2% Sikh 0.3% Agnostic 10% Atheist 6.5% Other (eg Buddhist) 1.7%</p> <p><b> In your opinion, do you actively practise your religion, i.e. you attend regular religious services?</b> Yes 31% No 69%</p> <p>While 83 per cent of respondents associate themselves with a religion, only 31 per cent say they actively practise it. With Christians scoring comparitively low. Among those who identified the Church of England as their religion, this figure drops to 23 per cent, which compares unfavourably with those who identified themselves as a follower of a non-Christian religion, 63 per cent of whom actively practise.</p> <p><b> The Colour of Love</b></p> <p><b> Have you ever been, or are you now, married to someone of a different colour to you?</b> Yes 5% No 95%</p> <p>Among those who describe their racial origins as other than white British, this figure of 5 per cent rises to 18 per cent.</p> <p><b> Would you consider marriage with someone of a different colour?</b> Yes 54% No 46%</p> <p><b> Have you ever had sex with someone of a different colour to you?</b> Yes 18% No 82%</p> <p><b> Would you ever consider having sex with someone of a different colour to you?</b> Yes 53% No 47%</p> <p>The results reveal a direct correlation between age and likelihood of considering a mixed-race marriage. While 80 per cent of those aged 18-24 would consider a mixed-race marriage, this figure falls with each subsequent age band to 27 per cent among the 65+ age group.</p> <p>The non-white British sample is more likely to consider marriage with someone of a different colour to them. While this may simply be a practical decision (it is a predominantly white country), it could also be an indication of higher levels of prejudice among the white population.</p> <p>The additional difficulties experienced by those in mixed-race marriages are illustrated by the fact that 14 per cent of those who currently are, or previously were, married to someone of a different colour would not consider mixed marriage again.</p> <p>Is it a level of hypocrisy or even a fear of the judgment of society that makes 13 per cent of those who have previously had sex with someone of a different colour say they would not consider marriage with someone of a different colour? 14 per cent of those who would not consider marriage with someone of a different colour would, however, consider having sex with someone of a different colour.</p> <p><b> Crimes and Misdemeanours</b></p> <p><b> Have you ever been charged with any of the following crimes?</b> If so, please indicate which ones. </p> <p>Motoring offences 19% Violent crime (including pub brawls etc) 3% Shoplifting 2% Drugs (personal consumption) 1% Theft/burglary 1% Fraud (eg benefit, tax or insurance) 1% Selling illegal goods (eg drugs, stolen property etc) 1% None of these 78%</p> <p><b> Have you ever committed any of the following crimes and not been caught or charged?</b> If so, please indicate which ones.</p> <p>Motoring offences 26% Drugs (personal consumption) 9% Shoplifting 9% Fraud (eg benefit, tax or insurance) 5% Violent crime (including pub brawls etc) 5% Selling illegal goods (eg drugs, stolen property etc) 4% Theft/burglary 3% None of these 67%</p> <p>One in five 18 to 24-year-olds has been criminalised by the UK drug laws: 20 per cent of this age group and 18 per cent of the 25-34 age group have consumed illegal drugs without being caught. However, while 9 per cent of the total population have consumed drugs, only 1 per cent have been charged with the crime. The dishonesty of the younger generation is exhibited once more as 9 per cent of 18-34s have sold illegal goods. Although the figures do not give any indication of the nature of these goods, it is likely that drugs are the most common.</p> <p>More than one-third (35 per cent) of all men have been charged with at least one crime compared with less than one-tenth (9 per cent) of women. Men (12 per cent) are twice as likely to have taken drugs as women (6 per cent). This trend extends to all crimes. Overall, 46 per cent of men have committed a crime and not been caught or charged, in comparison with 20 per cent of women. Among the most striking statistics are that men are three times as likely to have committed a motoring offence (39 per cent and 13 per cent respectively) and four times as likely to have committed a violent crime (8 per cent and 2 per cent respectively).</p> <p><b> If you found \u00a3200 in a wallet and you were certain nobody had seen you, which of the following would you be more likely to do?</b> Keep it 37% Hand it in to the police 63%</p> <p>Young people exhibit fewer moral scruples than older age groups. There is a direct correlation between age and the likelihood of keeping found money rather than handing it to police. 60 per cent of the 18-24 age group and 52 per cent of the 25-34 age group would keep the money while only 16 per cent of the 65+ age group would do so.</p> <p>It appears that economic necessity is not necessarily the main driver of the decision. 44 per cent of those working full time (7 per cent above the national average) would keep the money. Likewise, while the AB social group is the least likely to keep the money, a large minority - 27 per cent - would do so.</p> <p>While religious conviction reduces the likelihood of keeping the money, 23 per cent of those who actively practise religion would keep the money rather than hand it in to the police.</p> <p><b> Have you ever lied on...</b> (a) <b> A job application form </b>: Yes 25% No 75%</p> <p>(b) <b> An insurance form </b>: Yes 11% No 89%</p> <p>(c) <b> A tax form </b>: Yes 8% No 92%</p> <p>(d) <b> A mortgage application </b>: Yes 5% No 95%</p> <p>Men are consistently more likely to lie on official documentation than women. While it is difficult to draw a direct comparison on the basis of age (on the assumption that younger people are less likely to have filled in a mortgage application etc.) it appears that the younger groups have fewer scruples about lying on an application form. 38 per cent of the 18-24 group and 37 per cent of 25-34s have lied on job applications.</p> <p>18 per cent of 25-34-year-olds have lied on an insurance form. This could be attributed to increasingly stringent questions which have effectively disqualified a myriad of alternative lifestyles. Northerners are the least likely to lie on all forms.</p> <p><b> Have you ever taken hard drugs?</b> Yes 12% No 88%</p> <p>25 per cent and 22 per cent respectively of the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups have taken hard drugs. Men (16 per cent) are more than twice as likely to have taken hard drugs as women (7 per cent). 27 per cent of job seekers have taken hard drugs.</p> <p><b> Your Country: Rights and Wrongs </b></p> <p><b> What makes you most proud when you think of Britain?</b> (Top five responses) 1= History 11% 1= Royal family 11% 3= Countryside 8% 3= The people 8% 5. Freedom/free speech 7%</p> <p>45 per cent of the sample were unable to name anything which made them proud when thinking of Britain.

Midlands (eg Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton) 13% 4= Wales 9% 4= North West (eg Manchester, Liverpool) 9%</p> <p>The demographic sub-group variation in these answers are interesting. London is clearly the most popular region among 18-24-year-olds and respondents whose racial origins are not white British, although it ranks third overall; and yet it also tops the undesirable list. The capital evidently polarises opinion.</p> <p><b> Would you prefer to live in an urban or a rural area?</b> Rural 66% Urban 34%</p> <p>The rural preference was pretty widespread. The only demographic groups who would prefer to live in an urban rather than rural area are 18-24 year olds and those who are single.</p> <p><b> If you could live in any country in the world except Britain, where would you like to live?</b> (Top five responses) 1. USA 19% 2. Australia 13% 3. Spain 13% 4. Canada 9% 5= New Zealand 5% 5= Ireland 5%</p> <p>America was particularly popular among the 18-24 age group, 24 per cent of whom selected it.

      "bodyText": "Work, Rest and Pay Which of the following causes you the most anxiety in life? Money 32% Family 28% Job pressures 18% Time pressures 13% Love life 9% If there were two extra hours in the day, would you prefer to spend them ... With family 49% With friends 25% By yourself 17% Getting more work done 9% If you had the choice would you prefer to work shorter hours for the same amount of money or the same amount of hours for more money? Shorter hours - same money 46% Same hours - more money 54% Money causes the most anxiety in life for 32 per cent. This helps to explain why so many value additional money over free time. Love life causes the least anxiety which, combined with the high levels of confidence in partners' fidelity and the durability of marriage (see below in Love, Sex and Marriage), suggests that we tend to become complacent when we have found a partner. This is reinforced by the evidence that love life is more than three times more likely to be the primary cause of anxiety in the life for singles than those who are married or cohabiting. Money is not the primary source of anxiety for all age groups. Job pressures create more anxiety among 45 to 54-year-olds, while family causes the most anxiety for both the 55-64 and 65+ age groups. The results of the third question appear to contradict the commonly held belief that longer working hours have made us all victim to a \u0095time squeeze\u00ea effect. The other interpretation is that we are willing participants in this time squeeze rather than victims. Among those who work and said that they would like to spend more time with the family 50 per cent would opt for shorter hours while 50 per cent would prefer more money. This suggests that while family matters to this group, its importance could be eclipsed by the pursuit of money. On average, how many days work a year do you miss through 'sickies' - feigned illness? Average overall: 3.6 Average for men: 4.4 Average for women: 2.7 76 per cent of workers in the UK take at least one sickie per year. In addition to the differences in male and female workers, there is also some regional variation with Northern workers taking an average of 4.27 sickies per year in comparison with 3.4 in the South and 3.09 in the Midlands. If money were no object, would you: a) Educate your children privately? Yes 61% No 39% (b) Take out private healthcare? Yes 76% No 24% Overall, people are in favour of private education and healthcare. The older age groups (55+) appear to have the strongest attachment to the principles of state-supplied education and healthcare. For a significant minority, private healthcare is seen as a necessity while private education provides a moral quandary: 25 per cent of those who would take out private healthcare would refuse to educate their children privately if money were no object. Only 19 per cent of the British population would not take out private healthcare or educate their children privately. Love, Sex and Marriage Are you currently in a relationship? Yes 75% No 25% Are you confident that your partner is or has always been faithful to you? Yes 87% No 13% If you were to get married today, would you expect to stay married to the same person for the rest of your life? Yes 86% No 14% Other than the very high level of confidence in their partner's fidelity (which could be interpreted as complacency) one of the most interesting statistics is that there is no significant difference between the answers of men and women. There is a continued faith in marriage: 90 per cent of those who are marrie or cohabiting are confident of their partner's fidelity in comparison to 69 per cent of those who are not living with their partner. Do you believe that marriage between people of the same sex should be legal? Yes 31% No 69% Men (75 per cent) are more likely to be opposed to same-sex marriage than women (63 per cent). As with the previous question, the older the respondent, the less likely they are to believe that same-sex marriage should be legalised. Are you currently satisfied with your sex life? Yes 75% No 25% A quarter of the UK population is currently dissatisfied with their sex life. Furthermore, this dissatisfaction does not appear to be confined to young men. In fact, there is little significant difference between satisfaction levels across the spectrum of age and social class. As for gender, men, perhaps predictably, are less satisfied, but not by much (72 per cent to women's 80 per cent). Have you ever paid for sex? Yes 5% No 95% 61 per cent of those who have paid for sex have done so only once or twice suggesting that, for the majority, it is a one-off rather than habitual. Have you ever been to see a therapist? Yes 14% No 86% If so, did you find the therapy sessions helpful? Yes 68% No 32% These results appear to suggest that a stable relationship is the greatest ameliorative for mental turmoil, as 21 per cent of those who are single have been to see a therapist in comparison with 12 per cent of those who are married/living with a partner. There is little difference in tendency to consult a therapist based on social class (which could be used as a crude indicator of wealth). While women (16 per cent) are more likely to have seen a therapist than men (12 per cent), the disparity is not as great as may be expected. Men, it seems, are getting over their traditional reluctance to talk things over. What religion are you? Church of England 55% Roman Catholic 16% Other Christian 9% Muslim 1% Hindu 0.3% Jewish 0.2% Sikh 0.3% Agnostic 10% Atheist 6.5% Other (eg Buddhist) 1.7% In your opinion, do you actively practise your religion, i.e. you attend regular religious services? Yes 31% No 69% While 83 per cent of respondents associate themselves with a religion, only 31 per cent say they actively practise it. With Christians scoring comparitively low. Among those who identified the Church of England as their religion, this figure drops to 23 per cent, which compares unfavourably with those who identified themselves as a follower of a non-Christian religion, 63 per cent of whom actively practise. The Colour of Love Have you ever been, or are you now, married to someone of a different colour to you? Yes 5% No 95% Among those who describe their racial origins as other than white British, this figure of 5 per cent rises to 18 per cent. Would you consider marriage with someone of a different colour? Yes 54% No 46% Have you ever had sex with someone of a different colour to you? Yes 18% No 82% Would you ever consider having sex with someone of a different colour to you? Yes 53% No 47% The results reveal a direct correlation between age and likelihood of considering a mixed-race marriage. While 80 per cent of those aged 18-24 would consider a mixed-race marriage, this figure falls with each subsequent age band to 27 per cent among the 65+ age group. The non-white British sample is more likely to consider marriage with someone of a different colour to them. While this may simply be a practical decision (it is a predominantly white country), it could also be an indication of higher levels of prejudice among the white population. The additional difficulties experienced by those in mixed-race marriages are illustrated by the fact that 14 per cent of those who currently are, or previously were, married to someone of a different colour would not consider mixed marriage again. Is it a level of hypocrisy or even a fear of the judgment of society that makes 13 per cent of those who have previously had sex with someone of a different colour say they would not consider marriage with someone of a different colour? 14 per cent of those who would not consider marriage with someone of a different colour would, however, consider having sex with someone of a different colour. Crimes and Misdemeanours Have you ever been charged with any of the following crimes? If so, please indicate which ones. Motoring offences 19% Violent crime (including pub brawls etc) 3% Shoplifting 2% Drugs (personal consumption) 1% Theft/burglary 1% Fraud (eg benefit, tax or insurance) 1% Selling illegal goods (eg drugs, stolen property etc) 1% None of these 78% Have you ever committed any of the following crimes and not been caught or charged? If so, please indicate which ones. Motoring offences 26% Drugs (personal consumption) 9% Shoplifting 9% Fraud (eg benefit, tax or insurance) 5% Violent crime (including pub brawls etc) 5% Selling illegal goods (eg drugs, stolen property etc) 4% Theft/burglary 3% None of these 67% One in five 18 to 24-year-olds has been criminalised by the UK drug laws: 20 per cent of this age group and 18 per cent of the 25-34 age group have consumed illegal drugs without being caught. However, while 9 per cent of the total population have consumed drugs, only 1 per cent have been charged with the crime. The dishonesty of the younger generation is exhibited once more as 9 per cent of 18-34s have sold illegal goods. Although the figures do not give any indication of the nature of these goods, it is likely that drugs are the most common. More than one-third (35 per cent) of all men have been charged with at least one crime compared with less than one-tenth (9 per cent) of women. Men (12 per cent) are twice as likely to have taken drugs as women (6 per cent). This trend extends to all crimes. Overall, 46 per cent of men have committed a crime and not been caught or charged, in comparison with 20 per cent of women. Among the most striking statistics are that men are three times as likely to have committed a motoring offence (39 per cent and 13 per cent respectively) and four times as likely to have committed a violent crime (8 per cent and 2 per cent respectively). If you found \u00a3200 in a wallet and you were certain nobody had seen you, which of the following would you be more likely to do? Keep it 37% Hand it in to the police 63% Young people exhibit fewer moral scruples than older age groups. There is a direct correlation between age and the likelihood of keeping found money rather than handing it to police. 60 per cent of the 18-24 age group and 52 per cent of the 25-34 age group would keep the money while only 16 per cent of the 65+ age group would do so. It appears that economic necessity is not necessarily the main driver of the decision. 44 per cent of those working full time (7 per cent above the national average) would keep the money. Likewise, while the AB social group is the least likely to keep the money, a large minority - 27 per cent - would do so. While religious conviction reduces the likelihood of keeping the money, 23 per cent of those who actively practise religion would keep the money rather than hand it in to the police. Have you ever lied on... (a) A job application form : Yes 25% No 75% (b) An insurance form : Yes 11% No 89% (c) A tax form : Yes 8% No 92% (d) A mortgage application : Yes 5% No 95% Men are consistently more likely to lie on official documentation than women. While it is difficult to draw a direct comparison on the basis of age (on the assumption that younger people are less likely to have filled in a mortgage application etc.) it appears that the younger groups have fewer scruples about lying on an application form. 38 per cent of the 18-24 group and 37 per cent of 25-34s have lied on job applications. 18 per cent of 25-34-year-olds have lied on an insurance form. This could be attributed to increasingly stringent questions which have effectively disqualified a myriad of alternative lifestyles. Northerners are the least likely to lie on all forms. Have you ever taken hard drugs? Yes 12% No 88% 25 per cent and 22 per cent respectively of the 18-24 and 25-34 age groups have taken hard drugs. Men (16 per cent) are more than twice as likely to have taken hard drugs as women (7 per cent). 27 per cent of job seekers have taken hard drugs. Your Country: Rights and Wrongs What makes you most proud when you think of Britain? (Top five responses) 1= History 11% 1= Royal family 11% 3= Countryside 8% 3= The people 8% 5. Freedom/free speech 7% 45 per cent of the sample were unable to name anything which made them proud when thinking of Britain. Among the 18-24 age group this figure rose to 61 per cent. What makes you most embarrassed when you think of Britain? (Top five responses) 1. Hooligans/lager louts 33% 2. Litter/mess 11% 3. The government/New Labour 8% 4. Crime/criminals 6% 5. Racism/xenophobia 5% Hooliganism was three times as likely to be mentioned as its nearest rival in the embarrassment stakes, litter/dirty streets. If you had the opportunity to live in another part of Britain, where would you most like to live? (Top five responses) 1. South West (eg Bristol, Cornwall, Devon) 25% 2. Scotland 21% 3. London 12% 4. South and South East (eg Brighton, Portsmouth, Southampton) 11% 5. Wales 8% Where would you least like to live in Britain? (Top five responses) 1. London 32% 2. Northern Ireland 16% 3. Midlands (eg Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton) 13% 4= Wales 9% 4= North West (eg Manchester, Liverpool) 9% The demographic sub-group variation in these answers are interesting. London is clearly the most popular region among 18-24-year-olds and respondents whose racial origins are not white British, although it ranks third overall; and yet it also tops the undesirable list. The capital evidently polarises opinion. Would you prefer to live in an urban or a rural area? Rural 66% Urban 34% The rural preference was pretty widespread. The only demographic groups who would prefer to live in an urban rather than rural area are 18-24 year olds and those who are single. If you could live in any country in the world except Britain, where would you like to live? (Top five responses) 1. USA 19% 2. Australia 13% 3. Spain 13% 4. Canada 9% 5= New Zealand 5% 5= Ireland 5% America was particularly popular among the 18-24 age group, 24 per cent of whom selected it. It appears that the most important consideration for most would be finding another country whose first language was English. Discounting Britain, which is your favourite European country? (Top five responses) 1. Spain 26% 2. France 13% 3. Italy 12% 4. Ireland 11% 5. Portugal 8% Spain has across-the-board appeal. It was the most popular European country among every single demographic sub-group irrespective of age, gender, social class, region, marital status or ethnicity. &amp;149#;ICM Research interviewed a random selection of 1,206 adults aged 18+ between 25 and 30 January 2001.

      "body": "<p>How I miss being out in the middle. Two evenly matched teams have produced some brutally tense and competitive cricket.

It would have been the same had England lost. Cricket is a physical game decided by strength of mind. </p> <p>It is apparent now, following the clearing of the storm clouds around the umpires, that Sri Lanka conceded too much to England after Galle - their attacking batsmen have been planned out, Muttiah Muralitharan has been neutralised. Sanath Jayasuraya was snared just about every time by feeding him his favourite off-side slashes, and Darren Gough, Andy Caddick and Craig White trapped everyone else with a well-directed mixture of cutters, bouncers and slower balls. England's bowlers have been happy even to give up consecutive boundaries, as a prelude to the sucker set-up ball. Always playing to a plan, England have out-thought Sri Lanka, and ultimately outfought them. </p> <p>England's series victory is a credit to their team ethic. Batsmen have really played for their partners in the middle and their team-mates padded-up in the pavilion. And how the fielders have backed up their bowlers. England's catching was phenomenal. Just as significantly, Graham Thorpe and Gough, not content to be heroes with bat and ball, threw themselves around the field resisting the urge to conclude that a saved run or gained wicket before an imminent declaration didn't really matter. </p> <p>But the small things do matter. They lead to big things, and big things lead to huge things, and huge things lead to team success. It shows every person in the team that they are not fighting alone, that someone will work selflessly hard for you and that you should do the same for them. </p> <p>Sri Lanka have lost two Tests narrowly. And the reason why can be traced to the win in Galle. The afternoon of the first day in Galle, Robert Croft - then a bowler lacking in confidence - was not punished for his uninspired semi-flatties. He escaped torment, rediscovered the power of flight in time for Kandy and excelled with ball then bat. </p> <p>England's tail always came up with the goods when required, whereas at times our tail has been close to peacock length. If Sri Lanka had broken Croft in Galle, England's whole series strategy would have been compromised. Another significant difference between the teams can be traced to Marvan Atapattu's innings late on the second day. He should have pressed on after reaching 150 and not crawled to a personal landmark of 200. Lazy journalists and insecure players love landmarks - they are seen as shorthand for ability. But it is context that counts, how and when you perform. </p> <p>Throughout the series, England were able to raise their game when it mattered. They took vital wickets at momentum and morale-sapping times and the batsmen knuckled down, like Michael Vaughn and Thorpe did on Friday afternoon. It has been tough on Murali who bowled bravely and was denied vital breakthroughs at times which would have really boosted him. Murali is a competitor who has raised expectations to such a level that had he taken 25 wickets this series, people would not have been surprised. Nevertheless he caused England problems, and no English batsman looked thoroughly convincing against him, certainly not while playing him from the crease. Murali will have learnt a lot and should become an even better bowler. </p> <p>I took pride in building a team of competitors, even though he lost this series, Sanath can be proud also. He is one of those who have hurtled into boundary boards and he has suffered some outrageous slices of fortune. Yet he has come up fighting.

I certainly wasn't. </p> <p>While you always hope for the best, when the England party left for Pakistan I'd have settled for a couple of drawn series, to build on the victories over Zimbabwe and the West Indies last summer. </p> <p>Success in Pakistan was something special because we hadn't won there for so long and the predictions were for a heavy defeat - but this result in Sri Lanka is even better. </p> <p>Don't forget it's only three weeks since we lost by an innings in Galle. It's impossible to stress how difficult it is to lift a side that has been beaten by a big margin but also believes it got the rough end of at least half-a-dozen poor umpiring decisions. </p> <p>Coming back from one-down to win a three-match series is almost unheard of, particularly away from home. Yet this England team don't expect to be beaten and can now claim to be third-best in the world behind Australia and South Africa. </p> <p>That's one heck of a turnaround from 18 months ago when we were losing at home to New Zealand and were just about bottom of the international ladder. England seem to have discovered that elusive winning habit that comes from confidence and belief. </p> <p>When the chips are down they dig in - now the feelgood factor runs through the side. Everyone has contributed, even Ian Salisbury who was out of form with the ball in Pakistan, made useful runs and Robert Croft has found some form in the past couple of weeks. </p> <p>Mike Atherton and Ashley Giles were superb before Christmas, Darren Gough excelled in Sri Lanka and Craig White has chipped in with runs and wickets, although he'll want to forget that shot yesterday. </p> <p>But the key to the whole winter has been left-hander Graham Thorpe - he worked out how to play the twin threat of Saqlain Mushtaq in Pakistan and then Muttiah Muralitharan. His simple, untroubled approach has shown his colleagues how to be positive against spinners. </p> <p>Duncan Fletcher and his staff must also take credit. It has been impressive to see every batsman with a personal game plan - and sticking to it - and the bowlers adapting to the alien conditions. </p> <p>Back home this summer with the ball seaming around we should be favourites to beat Pakistan, and then it's Australia, the biggest hurdle of all. I can't wait for the Ashes to start. After four straight series wins England have a superb platform going into this battle and, given a good start, we have every reason to be optimistic. </p> <p>To go from near the bottom of the pile to the top in two years is perhaps expecting too much, but this team has faith in itself and the momentum is with us.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Back-to-back series wins on the Indian sub-continent - I'll bet you weren't expecting to read that five months ago. I certainly wasn't. While you always hope for the best, when the England party left for Pakistan I'd have settled for a couple of drawn series, to build on the victories over Zimbabwe and the West Indies last summer. Success in Pakistan was something special because we hadn't won there for so long and the predictions were for a heavy defeat - but this result in Sri Lanka is even better. Don't forget it's only three weeks since we lost by an innings in Galle. It's impossible to stress how difficult it is to lift a side that has been beaten by a big margin but also believes it got the rough end of at least half-a-dozen poor umpiring decisions. Coming back from one-down to win a three-match series is almost unheard of, particularly away from home. Yet this England team don't expect to be beaten and can now claim to be third-best in the world behind Australia and South Africa. That's one heck of a turnaround from 18 months ago when we were losing at home to New Zealand and were just about bottom of the international ladder. England seem to have discovered that elusive winning habit that comes from confidence and belief. When the chips are down they dig in - now the feelgood factor runs through the side. Everyone has contributed, even Ian Salisbury who was out of form with the ball in Pakistan, made useful runs and Robert Croft has found some form in the past couple of weeks. Mike Atherton and Ashley Giles were superb before Christmas, Darren Gough excelled in Sri Lanka and Craig White has chipped in with runs and wickets, although he'll want to forget that shot yesterday. But the key to the whole winter has been left-hander Graham Thorpe - he worked out how to play the twin threat of Saqlain Mushtaq in Pakistan and then Muttiah Muralitharan. His simple, untroubled approach has shown his colleagues how to be positive against spinners. Duncan Fletcher and his staff must also take credit. It has been impressive to see every batsman with a personal game plan - and sticking to it - and the bowlers adapting to the alien conditions. Back home this summer with the ball seaming around we should be favourites to beat Pakistan, and then it's Australia, the biggest hurdle of all. I can't wait for the Ashes to start. After four straight series wins England have a superb platform going into this battle and, given a good start, we have every reason to be optimistic. To go from near the bottom of the pile to the top in two years is perhaps expecting too much, but this team has faith in itself and the momentum is with us.",

That's a team. </p> <p>This may seem a strange place to start after such an astonishing victory and it is also a a sad indictment of Graeme Hick, omitted from the Test side again - perhaps for good this time - but the blunt fact is that the sight of Hick walking out to bat in a sub-continental Test match this winter has had us clinging to hopes rather than expectations. </p> <p>For Hick, Test cricket is an ordeal; for Vaughan a challenge. In his own quiet way, Vaughan, even though dismissed twice yesterday for eight runs, is excited by Test cricket, not intimidated by it. That makes 11. As Duncan Fletcher pointed out, Vaughan was fortunate to have Graham Thorpe at the other end when he started his important little innings on Friday. </p> <p>Thorpe, at peace with himself off the field, which has not always been the case on tour, has been inspired on it this winter. He's taken dazzling catches everywhere and his batting in his last three Test innings has been brilliant. To use the Aussie vernacular 'Thorpe's been on fire' and he's been playing like the modern Aussie, too: grabbing the initiative as soon as he comes to the crease, racing to 30 in no time, counterattacking in a crisis. His 46 in the second innings at Kandy was crucial because of the pace he scored his runs. So it was on Friday in Colombo when England were stumbling in mid afternoon. Soon Murali, yes even the maestro, was bowling to him with just one slip and no one else around the bat. </p> <p>For once, Murali's first instinct was to control the batsman rather than dismiss him. Once the field had retreated and his authority was established, Thorpe reined himself in, determined to keep Vaughan company as the young Tyke reacquainted himself with taut Test cricket. That's batting straight out of the Steve Waugh manual. </p> <p>He seems to have been batting ever since then. Yesterday morning, with a little help from Umpire Orchard, he was stranded and unbeaten thanks to Chaminda Vaas and some dangling English bats. </p> <p>Not since Graham Gooch's heroic knocks at Headingley against the West Indies and Pakistan in 1991 and 1992 respectively has one player stapled together an England innings with such isolated authority. And there he was again last night, just as he was on that gloomy - except for English cricket - evening in Karachi three months ago. Now he aped Steve Waugh as the iceman and the finisher. </p> <p>Just as England were wobbling in pursuit of their incredibly meagre target, there was Thorpe as exhausted as he's ever been on a cricket field to see them home. They used to wonder about his commitment; he was too insular, didn't like touring much. Cricket wasn't everything to him. Now this sense of perspective is perceived as a strength. Thorpe is mature enough not to fret about the headlines or his place in the team. Now he'll go for the big shot, the one that relieves the pressure and accept the consequences if it doesn't come off, something he has done regularly in the past two Tests. </p> <p>In recent times, England have not had many candidates for a notional World XI. On current form, Thorpe of the batsmen would be the first Englishman to be considered; Gough, of the bowlers, would demand a lengthy discussion. Yet again he has been superb. Sub-continental pitches don't worry him any more. No longer does his body look strained as he strives for extra pace. He's a big boy now; the puppy fat has gone and the central contract system should keep him going for a while. </p> <p>Individually, England's bowlers are not a terrifying prospect, especially in the sub-continent - especially their spinners. Steve Waugh and co, while recovering from their humiliation in Calcutta, will not be spending much time debating how they are going to combat the twin threat of Giles and Croft this summer. Indeed, when the Australians are in England it is highly improbable that both spinners will play, and quite possible that neither will. </p> <p>We won't embark here on a treatise on the resurgence of English spin. Before this match Giles had taken one for 239. But in Colombo we saw for the first time since England were in New Zealand in 1996-97 two England spinners in harness undermining the opposition. The current duo are unlikely to go down in the annals of the game alongside Laker and Lock but they are contributing at crucial moments. </p> <p>Giles has certainly been hampered by his dodgy Achilles; he may have been hampered by his startling success in Pakistan. It's easy for delusions of grandeur to set in even for the most level-headed of characters; this can result in placing four men around the bat instead of two, which was too often the case in Kandy. Here in Colombo pragmatism returned. He went back to basics: conservative fields at the start of his spell, pressure bowling rather than the pursuit of the unplayable ball and, as he slowed his approach to the wicket, his control improved. After his traumas in Galle and Kandy, this was a gutsy performance from Giles. Again here was a man stimulated by the situation, who was at his best when the match hung in the balance. </p> <p>Croft also has bowled cleverly, so much more useful to his captain than Ian Salisbury was in Pakistan. He may not have Murali's powers of spin, dip and flight, but he has changed his angle of attack adroitly, now over, now around (that's the one aspect where he's superior to Murali) and he's given nothing away. That two such unremarkable cricketers can have such an impact hints at new England's teamwork. The England side may not be refulgent, but they offer a substantial glimmer of light as a delicious summer of cricket approaches.</p>",

In between Thorpe's two unbeaten innings, England, with a flawless display of outcricket that was both intense and controlled, contrived to bowl the Sri Lankans out for 81 to set up a stunning victory by four wickets. </p> <p>'Bring on the Aussies' was the cry, though not from Nasser Hussain. Even in his jubilation there was the measured, common-sense reaction to England's latest triumph that has been a characteristic of this touring party. 'No, I'm not going to give you boys a \"Bring on the Aussies\" headline. One step at a time.' Even so the thought of having a crack at the Australians was hard to resist in the glow of another superb victory. </p> <p>Hussain and Thorpe professed themselves to being shattered, knackered and incredulous at England's win. It was debatable whether they would have enough energy to celebrate with gusto. If they try Hussain will have to hobble to the bar; someone may have to carry Thorpe, but after a performance of such monumental skill and courage (he scored 145 runs without being dismissed in a bowler's match), there will be no shortage of volunteers to get him there. Thorpe was the undisputed man of the match; Darren Gough was declared Man of the Series. </p> <p>Hussain said, 'When we turned up we thought it was just another day of Test cricket, but it's been an unbelievable day.' He outlined the strength of his side throughout the series: 'Losing three tosses out here could have been a massive psychological blow. In the old days heads would have dropped in that situation.' Not any more. How has the change come about? 'From the coach, the captain [he's never been one for false modesty and no one begrudges him that] and from winning.' </p> <p>He identified the Kandy Test as the crucial one. That kept the tour alive. Here in Colombo he announced to his team after they had been bowled out for 249 in their first innings with a meagre lead of eight, 'This is now a one innings match. Forget how tired you are or when you are going home.' But no one could quite believe that this one innings match would be over in two sessions; moreover this dedicated bunch only allowed their fatigue to hit them after Ashley Giles called Thorpe for the winning run at 6.12pm. </p> <p>It was an extraordinary day from the moment it was announced that, despite cloudless skies and intense heat, play would be delayed for half an hour because condensation had left a damp patch on the pitch. There was nothing wrong with this pitch; it was similar in character to those in Galle and Kandy, yet 22 wickets were to fall in the day for 227 runs. </p> <p>Eight players registered ducks yesterday and there was a record of 12 in the match. </p> <p>England's start was ominous. In his first over Vaas removed Michael Vaughan and Craig White with consecutive and identical balls, which were edged to the keeper. Thorpe on 73 then had his one major slice of luck. Propping forward to Murali he gave a bat pad catch, which was taken at silly point by Russel Arnold, but umpire Orchard had not spotted the obvious nick. This match was better umpired than the previous ones: Orchard made some mistakes, but it's worth noting that Asoka de Silva, the inexperienced Sri Lankan had an excellent game. </p> <p>Giles soon followed, edging Vaas, who was to achieve his best Test figures, and Robert Croft, after another handy little innings, was run out before Thorpe swept Murali to record his eighth Test hundred. Only a few lusty blows from Gough alongside the imperturbable Thorpe enabled England to take a slender lead. </p> <p>It was soon wiped away as Sanath Jayasuriya, determined to return to his old swashbuckling ways, crashed four boundaries. But Atapattu, hopelessly out of touch despite his double century three weeks ago soon lobbed an easy catch to mid-on and in the next over Sangakkara edged Caddick to the keeper. Then the irrepressible Gough intervened a second time. A full-length inswinger crashed into Jayasuriya's front pad and umpire de Silva quite properly sent the Sri Lankan captain on his way. </p> <p>Now the Sri Lankans rallied briefly as de Silva went for his strokes. But Caddick, usually the mechanical bowler in the side, duped him with a brilliant piece of cricket. De Silva pulled him for a boundary dismissively. The response of Caddick and Hussain was unusual, to say the least. The man on the square-leg boundary was brought up to save the single. Next ball de Silva, eyeing the gap in his favourite area, pulled another boundary; he seemed to be winning this stormy little duel. Now Caddick bowled his slow off-cutter and this time de Silva clipped the ball into the diving hands of - who else? - Thorpe at square leg. I can safely say this is the first time that Caddick has taken a Test wicket with that off-cutter. </p> <p>Arnold's dismissal was also noteworthy for less good reasons. Croft bowled him a ball that ended up, after some juggling, in the hands of Hussain at slip. Orchard signalled to the third umpire, one BC Cooray, thereby implying that the ball had been edged but that he was unsure whether it had been caught cleanly. Cooray gave the correct response - it had carried - but there were grave doubts whether Orchard had been right to conclude that the ball had ever hit Arnold's bat on its way to first slip. </p> <p>Now the Sri Lankans disintegrated against a rejuvenated Giles. He took four cheap wickets including the vital one of Mahela Jayawardena and had a hand in the other remaining dismissal, which epitomised the brilliance of England's outcricket. When Fernando top-edged a hook off Gough, Giles, no gazelle and nursing that dodgy Achilles, dived forward at long leg to take a beautifully judged catch. Murali summed up the Sri Lankans' disarray. When he came out to bat against Gough he didn't bother to take guard and he was out, lbw to his third ball, trying to reverse sweep Giles. </p> <p>Even so England's pursuit of 74 was not without alarms. Although the required total was so small Hussain said that he had rarely known the dressing room so nervous. So much hinged on attaining that target. Atherton avoided the indignity of being out to Vaas in every innings of the series; instead he became the only man to be dismissed by Fernando as he offered a gentle return catch. Jayasuriya, rather than Murali, whom England have neutered so decisively throughout the series, caused the most problems. </p> <p>Murali did manage to bowl Vaughan through the gate, but Jayasuriya disposed of Trescothick cutting, Stewart prodding, White sweeping and finally with three runs required England's lame captain was grabbed at silly point. But Thorpe, even though he was dizzy with fatigue at the start of his innings - they had thought of dropping him down the order - was not going to move until this memorable match was won.</p>",

Work on the reconstruction of the region will be harmed, and the little foreign investment will halt.</p> <p>The Macedonian army is small and ill-equipped to deal with a popular Albanian insurgency. During flashes of tension in the last 10 years, there have been popular calls for the Serbian army to come to their aid. In eastern Macedonia, the preference is for the support of the Bulgarian army.</p> <p>Throughout the last 10 years, Bulgaria has acted with wisdom and restraint. They have assisted Western policy whenever asked.</p> <p>The Serbs, post-Milosevic, are co-operating on almost every level with Western demands. The Serbian government will be reluctant to intervene in Macedonia unless the fighting affects the insurgency in southern Serbia.</p> <p>So, initially, a conflict in Macedonia would be a Kalashnikov war, with many civilian casualties in both communities.</p> <p>This would change if the fighting spread to the capital, Skopje, and Ohrid, in the South-west. Skopje has a large concentration of Albanians, living cheek-by-jowl with Macedonians. Fighting would be ruthless. Regional forces and the international community would find it hard to stand by and watch the mutual slaughter.</p> <p>Ohrid, which is roughly 50-50 Albanian-Macedonian, is a spiritual home of the Orthodox religion, and its history has a special resonance for Bulgarians. If Ohrid went up in flames, it would be a brave Bulgarian government that resisted calls from the Macedonians for fraternal assistance. If any neighbour intervenes, the southern Balkans will find itself trapped in a very dark hole.</p> <p>All this will agitate the restless Albanians of Kosovo. Nato may soon find itself involved in the conflagration, whether it likes it or not.</p> <p>Nato cannot deploy in Macedonia. It can, however, stop permitting the Albanian militants in southern Serbia and Macedonia to use Kosovo as their base. But using force against the insurgents is only half the story. The Macedonian government must concede some of the main Albanian parties' fundamental demands which it has often side-stepped. Firm action and political compromise is the only way out of a real nightmare.</p>",

During flashes of tension in the last 10 years, there have been popular calls for the Serbian army to come to their aid. In eastern Macedonia, the preference is for the support of the Bulgarian army. Throughout the last 10 years, Bulgaria has acted with wisdom and restraint. They have assisted Western policy whenever asked. The Serbs, post-Milosevic, are co-operating on almost every level with Western demands. The Serbian government will be reluctant to intervene in Macedonia unless the fighting affects the insurgency in southern Serbia. So, initially, a conflict in Macedonia would be a Kalashnikov war, with many civilian casualties in both communities. This would change if the fighting spread to the capital, Skopje, and Ohrid, in the South-west. Skopje has a large concentration of Albanians, living cheek-by-jowl with Macedonians. Fighting would be ruthless. Regional forces and the international community would find it hard to stand by and watch the mutual slaughter. Ohrid, which is roughly 50-50 Albanian-Macedonian, is a spiritual home of the Orthodox religion, and its history has a special resonance for Bulgarians. If Ohrid went up in flames, it would be a brave Bulgarian government that resisted calls from the Macedonians for fraternal assistance. If any neighbour intervenes, the southern Balkans will find itself trapped in a very dark hole. All this will agitate the restless Albanians of Kosovo. Nato may soon find itself involved in the conflagration, whether it likes it or not. Nato cannot deploy in Macedonia. It can, however, stop permitting the Albanian militants in southern Serbia and Macedonia to use Kosovo as their base. But using force against the insurgents is only half the story. The Macedonian government must concede some of the main Albanian parties' fundamental demands which it has often side-stepped. Firm action and political compromise is the only way out of a real nightmare.",

His son was just three, his young wife was eight months pregnant for a second time, and he had forged a new relationship with his alcoholic father after a lifetime of acrimony.</p> <p>Two years ago O'Brien finally won his freedom. He is now 33 and has only ashes to show for his life: his second child, a daughter, died in her cot when she was two months old; his wife left him a couple of months later for a string of other men; his father, broken by his son's imprisonment, drank himself into the grave.</p> <p>'When I fought for freedom during all those years in prison, I thought I was fighting to get out from behind bars,' said O'Brien. 'But prison smashed my life to bits. It was when I got out that my troubles really started.'</p> <p>O'Brien was one of the Cardiff Newsagent Three, wrongfully jailed for the 1987 murder of newsagent Philip Saunders, beaten to death with a shovel after a botched robbery near his home.</p> <p>To this day, O'Brien cannot understand why the police decided to sacrifice his life to close the Saunders case, but when he left prison he swore to become the Crown Prosecution Service's worst nightmare, destroying the system which destroyed him with a strong and careful hand.</p> <p>He fulfilled his promise last week with the launch of the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation, Mojo, alongside Paddy Hill, one of the Birmingham Six, in a Pugin-wallpapered parliamentary hall with the support of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. After the ceremony, O'Brien told the full story of his nightmare for the first time, emphasising that his tale, however awful, is just one of dozens of similar stories throughout the country.</p> <p>O'Brien was born Michael Bonello in Ely, Cardiff, in 1977, the second of six children brought up by his mother Marlene and their alcoholic and abusive step-father, Jimmy O'Brien. He was a lonely, painfully shy boy who escaped the constant bullying at school by wandering around the local wasteland until it was late enough to go home each night.</p> <p>At 15, O'Brien left school and found work as a shelf stacker. Two years later he met his future wife: Donna Purcigo was just 15 but they fell in love immediately. When they married in 1986, Donna was eight months pregnant and they were both delighted. 'It was the most secure I'd felt in a very long time,' said O'Brien.</p> <p>Kyle, their son, was born on 24 August, 1986. 'I couldn't wait to get him home and do all the silly things dads do,' said O'Brien. 'I wanted to bath him and play with him. I'd never been so happy.'</p> <p>Despite their happiness, the marriage started disintegrating. Donna began having affairs and O'Brien followed suit. But the collapse of his marriage disturbed him and when he was attacked and sexually abused by an older man soon afterwards he fell into a deep depression, spending time in a mental hospital.</p> <p>Donna became pregnant again and O'Brien turned to drink: 'I'd always refused to touch alcohol because I'd seen what it had done to Jimmy, but I didn't even think about Jimmy; I just turned to the first thing that gave me comfort.'</p> <p>On 12 October, 1987 - the night Saunders was murdered - O'Brien, his brother-in-law Ellis Sherwood, and Darren Hall stole a car and went joyriding. 'It was the first time I'd done anything worse than nicking crisps, but I went along because I was too cowardly to say no,' he admitted. O'Brien was still in bed next morning when the police called. There were three cars and 10 officers. They surrounded the house and smashed the door down with a sledgehammer.</p> <p>At the police station, O'Brien was refused a solicitor. 'They were shouting and screaming at me. They lied to get me confused and twisted my words to try to get me to admit to things I hadn't said. They wanted Ellis more than they wanted me because he already had a criminal record, but they said that if I didn't give evidence against him they'd take me down too. And that's what they did.'</p> <p>Unable to keep O'Brien in custody for more than 72 hours without charging him, the police freed him with a promise that it was only just beginning. One week later, they burst into O'Brien's house a second time and took the 19-year-old to the station. This time he was charged with murder and taken to Cardiff prison on remand.</p> <p>When Kylie, O'Brien's daughter, was born a few weeks later he was not allowed to attend the birth and could only see her for 15 minutes each day. 'The closing-up I did of my emotions in those first months was extreme, but I had no choice,' he said. 'I could only survive what was happening by cutting off entirely.'</p> <p>Six months later, O'Brien had a visit from his solicitor. 'He said he had something important to tell me.' A priest was waiting for him and O'Brien was told to sit down: his daughter had died of cot death that morning. 'It wouldn't sink in,' he said. 'Half of me died that day; it was burnt out at the root.'</p> <p>Two months later, O'Brien had another visit: Donna was leaving him. 'She smashed me to bits with that news,' he said. 'The rest of me died a few weeks later at the trial.'</p> <p>The trial lasted for three weeks. 'As soon as it began, I knew we were finished,' said O'Brien. 'I spent most of the time just staring at my family: I wanted to make sure I'd remember them.'</p> <p>O'Brien was sent to Long Lartin prison. 'I saw seven men murdered in front of me during my time there; one was stabbed in his groin, heart and his lungs,' he said. 'I had to learn to defend myself: I carried a knife in one pocket and a screwdriver in the other.'</p> <p>O'Brien met Carl Bridgewater, Vincent Hickey and Michael Shirley during his years in prison, but the support of other innocent men was lost on O'Brien: he was losing control, taking all the drugs he could find and retreating into his own world.</p> <p>Then he met Paddy Hill. 'Paddy was a hero to us all. He took me in hand. He told me that unless I started using my anger constructively, I'd spend the rest of my life behind bars. Something flick ered inside me then for the first time in years. I lay awake that night thinking, and by the morning I knew that he was right,' said O'Brien.</p> <p>O'Brien visited the prison psychologist and the doctor. He began weaning himself off drugs and studying law. 'I saw how wrongly I'd been treated and how many laws the police had broken,' he said. 'My mind began opening up and I began fighting back.' O'Brien divided up his day: three hours for criminal law, one hour for human rights and one hour for prison law.</p> <p>He organised press releases around every anniversary possible: the date of the murder and the date of his trial.

He also wept when questioned about his break-up with fellow superstar Jennifer Lopez.</p> <p>Combs's entertainment, clothing and food companies gross more than $300 million (\u00a3200 million) a year and employ more than 400 people. But five lawsuits now threaten him, in an echo of the OJ Simpson case in 1994.</p> <p>Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges, but civil suits carrying a lower burden of proof were successful, and crippled his image. The criminal case must prove allegations 'beyond reasonable doubt', while civil law only requires proof 'on the balance of probabilities'.</p> <p>The suits against Combs include one filed by his chauffeur, Wardel 'Woody' Fenderson, an intriguing figure who dominated the courtroom as key prosecution witness, and who claims he was offered $50,000 by Combs to say a gun Combs had put in his waistband, later fired and recovered by police, belonged to him.</p> <p>The management of the Club New York, in which the fracas took place on December 27, 1999, has also filed a suit, as have three of the people injured when Combs's fellow rapper and protege Jamal 'Shyne' Barrow opened fire.</p> <p>A crucial ingredient in the civil hearings, unaffected by the criminal acquittal, will be affidavits that Combs used his power and influence to swagger in the club, thereby causing chaos around him.</p> <p>Combs confessed in the New York Times interview: 'I am definitely a victim of my own image.' He has, he admits, spent 'too much time...strutting' his power and his wealth.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/focus/story/0,6903,458558,00.html\">Pop's Bad Boy beats the rap</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The rap mogul Sean 'Puffy' Combs faces a billion dollars-worth of civil suits as he seeks to keep his corporate empire and image intact - in spite of his triumphant acquittal on charges of witness bribery and gun possession in Manhattan's federal court on Friday. In an unusually candid interview with the New York Times, Combs yesterday confessed that he wishes he had shed his 'gangsta' act years ago. He also wept when questioned about his break-up with fellow superstar Jennifer Lopez. Combs's entertainment, clothing and food companies gross more than $300 million (\u00a3200 million) a year and employ more than 400 people. But five lawsuits now threaten him, in an echo of the OJ Simpson case in 1994. Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges, but civil suits carrying a lower burden of proof were successful, and crippled his image. The criminal case must prove allegations 'beyond reasonable doubt', while civil law only requires proof 'on the balance of probabilities'. The suits against Combs include one filed by his chauffeur, Wardel 'Woody' Fenderson, an intriguing figure who dominated the courtroom as key prosecution witness, and who claims he was offered $50,000 by Combs to say a gun Combs had put in his waistband, later fired and recovered by police, belonged to him. The management of the Club New York, in which the fracas took place on December 27, 1999, has also filed a suit, as have three of the people injured when Combs's fellow rapper and protege Jamal 'Shyne' Barrow opened fire. A crucial ingredient in the civil hearings, unaffected by the criminal acquittal, will be affidavits that Combs used his power and influence to swagger in the club, thereby causing chaos around him. Combs confessed in the New York Times interview: 'I am definitely a victim of my own image.' He has, he admits, spent 'too much time...strutting' his power and his wealth.

He is right. But surely a more important reason is the assumed refusal of most of the electorate to regard an equitable taxation system as an acceptable part of civic duty. The present Government hasn't dared seriously to challenge this assumption. If restored to office in the next election, it should. What's it got to lose, except pariah status?

Well, I'm a single mother and for the last four years I've worked full time as a computer programmer, and I say, forget it! Tight deadlines, stress and long hours (40-, 50- and even 60-hour weeks, sometimes working till 1am) make this the hardest job I've ever done. The burgeoning technological emphasis means that you are almost certainly better off if you start out with a computer science degree (I didn't), and when my colleagues - all young, married men - go home, my next port of call is 24-hour Tesco followed by whatever cooking, washing and cleaning I can manage. Despite the job satisfaction I get, I wouldn't recommend it to any other single mother. Stella Fisher York",

Why then, do they give such an impression of underperforming? </p> <p>The answer surely lies in the depth and volume of talent that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has assembled. With such an array, it never surprises you that they win matches, but genuinely does when they don't. At times they remind you of Tiger Woods; with his game 'ossum' as the Americans call it, he should win everything. </p> <p>Then you remind yourself that football, sport, is never just about talent. If it were, Holland would have won the World Cup in 1974. It is also about industry and attitude, character and determination. George Graham's Highbury mantra of a decade ago - 'desire plus talent equals success' - summed it up. The problem in Graham's latter days was that there was simply not enough talent. </p> <p>Wenger was fortunate when he took over as manager that he still had access to the reservoir of desire. It may well be that now, however, the balance has shifted too far the other way. If the manager decides to extend his contract beyond the summer of 2002 - and he has insisted that he will at least see it out, even if noises out of Barcelona put him in demand there - he may have to sacrifice some of the talent for more of the desire; some steel to go with the style. </p> <p>He himself is forced to accept the point that in a season that has seen Arsenal suffer more heavy defeats than in living memory - in Moscow, at Anfield and Old Trafford - there have been flaws in the psyche of the team. 'I feel in some games we have been lacking in character,' he admits. </p> <p>Never has it been seen in Tony Adams, whose intention to retire in 15 months' time will give Wenger an even bigger hole to fill. Of late, back to fitness, Adams has often been seen rampaging upfield as if to reinforce a message to some of the gifted but laissez-faire members further forward that attitude is as important as aptitude. </p> <p>Adams has already said that this is probably the most talented squad he has known in his 18 years as a first-teamer and that there should be a trophy in it this season. So, after the limp performance in Munich on Wednesday, is it time for him to be telling the team as much? 'I've done that,' he says. 'The time for talking is past.' </p> <p>He personally is not too concerned by Arsenal's stumbling into the quarter-finals, and being seen as the weakest of the last eight. 'I don't mind people saying we are not good enough,' he says. 'That's what they said in '94, through every round of the Cup Winners' Cup. Even after we won it, people were saying we weren't good enough. </p> <p>'What is happening at the moment is talk of extremes. But we are not as bad as people are saying, though I have to say that we are not as good as we think we are sometimes.' It is classic Adams; always seeking the balanced view as well as reminding his team that effort is still needed to accompany ability. </p> <p>Just as Manchester United have six midfield players and strikers who can win a game on their own any given day, even if five are misfiring, so do Arsenal. The difference is in the work ethic and fierce competition that those six also bring to the team. Unlike United's, frequently when they lose the ball, some of Arsenal's forward players shrug their shoulders and wait for it to be returned to them, rather than join in the collective attempt to recover it. </p> <p>Thierry Henry especially, along with Sylvain Wiltord and Robert Pires - the latter pair fined earlier this season for some late-night, pre-game revelries that also betray a lack of solidarity with the team - can be particularly culpable. It is at odds with managers' assertions that teams should both attack and defend as units. It has also given Arsenal an uncharacteristic them-and-us, individualistic feel at times, defence divorced from attack. </p> <p>As a consequence, Patrick Vieira - probably still pining for Emmanuel Petit alongside him - has looked isolated in his attempts at the marriage- guidance role of holding it together and implementing the cherished Arsenal system of shielding the back four, the more so when Ray Parlour is injured. In addition, the older legs at the back are suffering from more fatigue than they should be. Take this from Lee Dixon after Munich on Wednesday: 'I felt tired in the last 10 minutes but then I looked over at Tony and he looked more tired than me.' </p> <p>Much has been made that their replacements, such as Igor Stepanovs and Oleg Luzhny, are inadequate - and indeed Arsenal were humbled 6-1 at Old Trafford when they were without any of their Olde Englishe rearguard for the first time in a decade - but you could only sympathise with the way the stand-ins were left exposed by forward players who absented themselves when the going got tough. </p> <p>Wenger is clearly aware of the issue and the need to address it. Might he have to sacrifice some talent to recruit or instil some desire (and it is significant that the players he has been linked with in the past week, Sol Campbell and Marko Rehmer of Hertha Berlin, are both physically and mentally strong)? </p> <p>'To sacrifice is difficult to say,' he replies, 'because at the level we play, to play without talent you have no chance. But also character alone is not enough. I believe we have talent and character but I concede in some games this year we have shown signs of weakness of character. Bayern Munich was one but we got away with it. Now, if we want to turn our season into a successful season we have to show character.' </p> <p>Today at Aston Villa, in the sort of bread-and-butter away game that some at Arsenal have treated with apparent disdain this season, is a good starting point to rediscover some resilience for the huge challenges of a few weeks hence. </p> <p>More of the attitude of Adams - determined to play despite a cold developed while being up all night with his ill son last Thursday - will be needed. 'It's an important game because I want to be in the Champions League again next season,' he says. 'The big games will take care of themselves. We need to take care of these ones ourselves.'</p>",

Isaiah Rankin was the man who eventually destroyed the home team in the last minute leaving Aldridge happy to tender his resignation. </p> <p>The Tranmere board accepted and that was that. After a tremendous FA Cup run this season, it was the club's league form that proved too much for the former Liverpool striker.</p> <p>Paul Rideout, experiencing a new lease of life with Tranmere, at the age of 36, is continuing to cling to the hope that his playing career can be extended beyond this season. </p> <p>When he joined Tranmere at the start of the season, Rideout planned that it would be his last and intended to concentrate on a coaching career in the United States from this summer. However, his impact at Tranmere, highlighted by his hat-trick in the remarkable FA Cup win at Southampton has prompted second thoughts. In an interview on Tranmere's official website, he explained: 'I did not realise how much I would enjoy it [playing]. I haven't had any offers for next season and that could continue, but I will sit down with my wife and agent and discuss things. It would be nice to feel wanted at my age.'.' </p> <p>Rideout, who will be 37 in August, stressed that he cannot be compared with Aldridge, who was 39 when he finally called it a day as a player. Aldridge, he points out, was more of a goal poacher than he is. 'The gaffer just sat in the six yard box and was the best in the business at what he did,' Rideout said. 'There is nothing more important in football than a striker who scores goals. </p> <p>'As for myself, I have not scored that many this season, although I have been helping out in other areas.' </p> <p>Blackburn's manager Graeme Souness had warned that Wimbledon had the ability to bring his team down to earth after their midweek win over Birmingham, and it proved spot on. </p> <p>Having emerged as strong favourites to fill the second automatic promotion spot behind Fulham, Blackburn were held to a draw - a result that helped Bolton increase their lead over their Lancashire neighbours from goal difference to two points. The one consolation for Blackburn was that it could easily have been worse. Wimbledon took the lead through Jason Euell, but Matt Jansen equalised near the end. </p> <p>The biggest surprise was Birmingham's 2-0 defeat at Stockport. This game would have been of more than passing interest to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson; Stockport's striker, Shefki Kuqi, who is expected to face England in the forthcoming World Cup qualifier, scored both goals. </p> <p>In addition to Bolton, the other winners among the promotion race leaders were Preston, who came from behind to overcome Norwich 2-1. Fulham took only 14 minutes to go in front against struggling Crystal Palace, through Luis Boa Morte, and he hit Palace again to make it 2-1. </p> <p>Huddersfield, 2-1 winners over Sheffield United, increased the gap between Tranmere and themselves at the bottom to three points. </p> <p>West Brom's manager, Gary Megson, was given a huge verbal pat on the back yesterday - from one of his biggest rivals. With West Brom facing Wolves at Molineux today, the Wolves assistant-manager, John Ward described the job Megson has done in getting his team into the promotion play-off zone as 'fantastic.' </p> <p>This will be the first time that West Brom defender Matt Carbon and Wolves striker George Ndah have played against each other since the Carbon tackle that caused Ndah's broken leg last season. But Carbon insisted that Ndah bore no grudges towards him: 'I spoke to George after the incident to see how he was and again later on, and he was perfectly fine with me.'</p>",

Aldridge, he points out, was more of a goal poacher than he is. 'The gaffer just sat in the six yard box and was the best in the business at what he did,' Rideout said. 'There is nothing more important in football than a striker who scores goals. 'As for myself, I have not scored that many this season, although I have been helping out in other areas.' Blackburn's manager Graeme Souness had warned that Wimbledon had the ability to bring his team down to earth after their midweek win over Birmingham, and it proved spot on. Having emerged as strong favourites to fill the second automatic promotion spot behind Fulham, Blackburn were held to a draw - a result that helped Bolton increase their lead over their Lancashire neighbours from goal difference to two points. The one consolation for Blackburn was that it could easily have been worse. Wimbledon took the lead through Jason Euell, but Matt Jansen equalised near the end. The biggest surprise was Birmingham's 2-0 defeat at Stockport. This game would have been of more than passing interest to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson; Stockport's striker, Shefki Kuqi, who is expected to face England in the forthcoming World Cup qualifier, scored both goals. In addition to Bolton, the other winners among the promotion race leaders were Preston, who came from behind to overcome Norwich 2-1. Fulham took only 14 minutes to go in front against struggling Crystal Palace, through Luis Boa Morte, and he hit Palace again to make it 2-1. Huddersfield, 2-1 winners over Sheffield United, increased the gap between Tranmere and themselves at the bottom to three points. West Brom's manager, Gary Megson, was given a huge verbal pat on the back yesterday - from one of his biggest rivals. With West Brom facing Wolves at Molineux today, the Wolves assistant-manager, John Ward described the job Megson has done in getting his team into the promotion play-off zone as 'fantastic.' This will be the first time that West Brom defender Matt Carbon and Wolves striker George Ndah have played against each other since the Carbon tackle that caused Ndah's broken leg last season. But Carbon insisted that Ndah bore no grudges towards him: 'I spoke to George after the incident to see how he was and again later on, and he was perfectly fine with me.'",

Except that Gerrard is unlikely to be going to Albania. After omitting him from the last squad so that he could take part in the Worthington Cup final, Eriksson appears willing to accede to G\u00e9rard Houllier's request to use the 20-year-old midfielder sparingly. </p> <p>'The boy is still growing, and he is not ready to repeat games at that level,' Houllier said. 'International football is a step up from club games, and two games in five days would be too much. I am perfectly happy for him to be involved against Finland if Mr Eriksson wants him, especially as the game is at Liverpool. But going straight out to Albania would be too much of a rush, especially as it is the travelling that gives Stevie a problem.' </p> <p>It is a sign of how highly Eriksson and Tord Grip rate Gerrard that they are apparently prepared to go along with the Liverpool manager's wishes. 'Mr Eriksson knows the situation, and in any case he would realise it for himself,' Houllier said. </p> <p>Grip was unable to confirm that Gerrard would be in England's starting line-up on Saturday, although he seems certain to get the vote ahead of Nicky Butt in a midfield likely to feature David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Steve McManaman, but he indicated Eriksson had agreed to use the player cautiously. 'We know he can't play too many games in a row,' Grip said. 'If his club say he can't play in both these games we have to accept that. This will not always be the case, as Gerrard's strength is improving all the time. He has played in 35 games this season, I think, but only because Liverpool have been careful.' </p> <p>Butt, who played well against Spain at Villa Park last month, will presumably get his chance against Albania. Midfield prospects such as Michael Carrick and Joe Cole should make the squad, but Butt's international experience at club level should count in his favour. Similarly, Eriksson seems ready to bring in Real Madrid's McManaman as a replacement for Nick Barmby on the left of midfield. After scoring the first goal of the new regime, Barmby can consider himself unlucky. He was one of England's best players against Spain and but for injury would surely have kept his place in the starting line-up. </p> <p>McManaman was injured last time round, but is now back in action for Real, and not only playing well but playing on the left. 'He is doing very well, and playing on the left in every game.' Grip said. 'If he can do that for Real Madrid he can play in the same position for the national team.' </p> <p>Between them, Eriksson and Grip place a great deal of importance on selecting players in their usual positions. The only player used out of position against Spain was Heskey, who played wide right in the second half, and Eriksson apologised about that afterwards. As far as Grip is concerned, the debate about Beckham's best position is a non-starter. 'He plays on the right wing for Manchester United, and I'm sure Sir Alex Ferguson would know if there was a better place to play him,' he said. 'I accept that United have Roy Keane in their midfield, but if that is where Beckham plays his football every week then that is where he will feel most comfortable playing for England. We don't have the players for long, it is too wasteful of time to give them new roles.We want them to feel confident and secure It is the same with Paul Scholes. If he plays in a certain position for his club then it is important to keep him in the same position for his national team.If we are going to change anybody's position, then there would have to be a very special reason.' </p> <p>Grip habitually writes down the formation of every team he watches, so he can be sure which players he has seen in which positions. 'Some players can fill more than one position for their clubs - I have seen Gerrard in different roles for Liverpool,' he said. 'I have also seen Liverpool play Michael Owen as a secondary striker, playing slightly deeper than the front man, which is why we tried him in that role against Spain. I think it suits him. Perhaps he finds it easier to come into the game from there, where you are not so well marked. If you just play two strikers right up the field you make it easy for the opposing defence to know who to mark. I could see the big men in the Finland defence just soaking that up while the rest of the team waited to counter. But if Owen drops off the front man to pick up the ball he poses a problem for defenders, as well as finding the space to start his movements.' </p> <p>Houllier, as it happens, is in complete agreement. 'I was not surprised Eriksson played Owen off Cole,' he said. 'No team plays with two strikers these days.' Liverpool actually play with four, and the lot of them could be involved at Anfield - with Jari Litmanen orchestrating the Finns' attacks. 'Jari is what every manager wants,' Houllier said, 'an ideal link between midfield and the striking line.' </p> <p>Litmanen terrorised England in Helsinki after hardly figuring in the Barcelona side for months, so what he might do at his new home ground when approaching full fitness is anyone's guess. He is not the Finns' only dangerous forward - Charlton's Jonatan Johansson will also be playing in familiar surroundings - but if the evidence of the last game is anything to go by Litmanen will be the brains behind the operation. </p> <p>How will England approach the game? 'Professionally, I hope,' Grip said. 'We need points, but we should not play into Finland's hands by storming forward at every opportunity. We must try to control the game in the same way Liverpool did against Porto. They controlled that game all night. They were excellent.' It sounds like England might be ready for a new SAS.

Milan had just completed the melancholic procession of Italian clubs eliminated from Europe.</p> <p>While some of his team-mates made a cowardly dash away from the embarrassment and others crashed melodramatically to the turf, Maldini strode solemnly, shaking his head as he went. He was the only player whose body language expressed, unmistakably, that it was the club, not just the individual, who had been shamed. Oh, that it had come to this.</p> <p>Back home Maldini has a hat-trick of European Cup medals. He is a veteran of the Milan of the late 1980s and early '90s, the Milan of maestro Baresi and Dutch wonders van Basten, Gullit and Rijkaard, the Milan of impeccable teamwork fused with irresistible flair. From halcyon days to dark nights: the Milan of today have lost their aura and that, for Maldini, is hard to stomach. They used to strike awe and dread into their opponents; last week Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a arrived cocksure, relaxed and eager to take advantage of the tangible fear of the rossoneri. 'Everybody knows what Milan has done before in the past, but we won in Barcelona in front of more people than tonight,' remarked Deportivo's striker Roy Makaay dismissively. </p> <p>San Siro, so what? In 66 days' time, this magnificent stadium, with its spacecraft architecture, its amphitheatre vastness, its smell of occasion - and its dreadful pitch - will host the Champions League final. How dearly Milan wanted to be there. One bang of a firecracker shuddered through the night air to signal the end of a dream - then you could barely hear a whimper as the fans filed silently away, reflecting the air of resignation among the majority of their idols, super-rich failures who later shrugged their shoulders at the media because they had nothing to say. What did we expect - apologies? </p> <p>Read what you will into Billy Costacurta's icy disdain. Up in the tribune of honour the club's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, was surrounded by television cameras, grabbed a microphone, and blamed the coach, Alberto Zaccheroni, who had worn the look of a man expecting to be offered his last cigarette all game long. The press, generously as it turned out, reckoned the coach would be gone within 48 hours.</p> <p>By morning Zaccheroni was history. There is a pattern here: of the eight Italian clubs who faltered in Europe this season, five have parted with a manager (Parma excelled themselves by sacking two) and Udinese are expected to follow suit any day now. There is no stability, and as a consequence Italian clubs' European status is in decline. Not since 1982 have Italy failed to provide a representative in the quarter-finals of European club competitions. (Let's not pretend Udinese's march to the final of the Inter-Toto pre-season kickabout is worth a popped champagne cork.)</p> <p>The Gazzetta dello Sport summed it up with a stinging paradox: 'I ricci straccioni' - the rich down and outs. For all the zillions of lire coursing through Italian football, the clubs are poor in spirit, and consequently out of Europe. The Gazetta seethed about Milan's half- baked effort against Deportivo. It was symbolic of the country's football this season: 'Bombastic, arrogant and chased out of Europe.' </p> <p>The inquest rages. One local journalist, with hangdog look and umpteenth cigarette, came up with a simple explanation: loadsamoney. Milan, he suspected, were more interested in being in the Champions League than winning it, the result of a guaranteed return of \u00a38million per group phase. He envisaged a cycle of participating, picking up the profits, then going out to concentrate on finishing high enough in Serie A to qualify for more easy money again next year.</p> <p>As if to prove his point, Zaccheroni insisted all season that a top-four finish was what was asked of him (past performances give Italian clubs four places in the Champions league). 'Would being told before the season to finish in the top three of the Premiership be acceptable to Manchester United?' asked the scribe. Italy is confronting the reality that Serie A has toppled from its European pedestal. Giovanni Trapattoni, coach of the national team, entered the debate by suggesting calcio take a long hard look at itself. It is important not to overdramatise, as Latin footballing countries are prone to do, but be rational. 'It's not that we have suddenly got much worse, but that the others have caught up with us,' he said. 'Until recently all the best foreign players played in our league. Not any more. We had a tournament with more class, more fantasy and the best tactical preparation, which gave us the potential to be at our best in the cups. Not any more.' </p> <p>Instead we look to Spain. There can be no more powerful case made for the strength of La Liga than their current European domination. Ten years ago in the Uefa Cup quarter-finals, it was Italy 4, Spain 0. Now it's Spain 4, Italy 0. Over in the Champions League, it's Spain 3, Italy 0 (even more emphatic than last year's 3-1 scoreline). The biggest boon is the arrival of competition debutants Deportivo - to join more experienced campaigners Real Madrid and Valencia - at the expense of the Italians. 'In the first stage Juventus was the favourite and we finished first, this time Milan was the favourite and we finished first again,' points out Makaay. 'We have a good team, we have demonstrated that in La Liga and in Europe. The most important thing was to go through, although being first in the group makes it even better. Very nice. Now we have fun.' </p> <p>Beware, Leeds. In contrast to the rampant top dogs Spain and the chasing pack from England, Italy, the most decorated nation in European competition over the past decade, has endured extraordinary humiliation. Internazionale take the ignominy prize for being dumped out of the Champions League qualifying round by the Swedish club Helsingborgs, and following up by blowing their second chance in the Uefa Cup, appropriately against a Spanish club, little Alaves. There is a morality tale here. Inter, who have gone through nine managers and more than \u00a3250 million-worth of players since Massimo Moratti took over in 1995 (return: one Uefa Cup) conquered at home by Alaves? Che? Inter were mortified. </p> <p>World Champion Laurent Blanc launched a scathing critique: 'I've been here a year-and-a-half but results demonstrate that we're not a great team or a great organisation.

The answer is a glut of expensive players whose egos are as delicate as eggshells.</p> <p>Liam Brady, who wore the Inter shirt during his spell in Italy and remains a great friend of their current manager, Marco Tardelli, believes this is the root of their problem. 'It is the curse of the squad system. At this level, there are too many players who think they are first choices. We're not talking about 15, as you find at Manchester United, but 25. It must be a headache to pick the bench. When I played for Juventus [champions two seasons running] the team picked itself. We had five or six substitutes who were young, realised they had to learn, and accepted their position.

If not, the feisty Turk Fatih Terim, who walked out on Fiorentina not long ago, is the hot favourite to try his luck next season, although Marcello Lippi is also said to be in with a shout.

      "bodyText": "There was a certain dignity about Paolo Maldini as he took the long walk across the San Siro pitch towards the dressing room. Milan had just completed the melancholic procession of Italian clubs eliminated from Europe. While some of his team-mates made a cowardly dash away from the embarrassment and others crashed melodramatically to the turf, Maldini strode solemnly, shaking his head as he went. He was the only player whose body language expressed, unmistakably, that it was the club, not just the individual, who had been shamed. Oh, that it had come to this. Back home Maldini has a hat-trick of European Cup medals. He is a veteran of the Milan of the late 1980s and early '90s, the Milan of maestro Baresi and Dutch wonders van Basten, Gullit and Rijkaard, the Milan of impeccable teamwork fused with irresistible flair. From halcyon days to dark nights: the Milan of today have lost their aura and that, for Maldini, is hard to stomach.

      "body": "<p>Anyone who fleetingly believed that punk would change the world might have been surprised by last weekend's headlines. Certainly they would have been gratified that a state of anarchy had finally been declared, but perhaps somewhat disappointed to discover that all it seemed to involve was 15 men dressed in white muttering at each other and occasionally wagging a finger or chucking a helmet. </p> <p>Ah well, time moves on and life is full of surprises. In one regard the headlines weren't over-blown. Matters become anarchic when 'there is a state of lawlessness due to the absence or inefficiency of the supreme power'. In Kandy the laws of cricket were broken with impunity and the umpires, while not quite absent, were clearly inefficient. </p> <p>Not that this was entirely their fault. To recall the words used by Norman Lamont when he made his sole beneficial contribution to British political life, the umpires were 'in office, but not in power'. They were, to continue the analogy, as hamstrung as John Major at his weakest: bereft of respect, uncertain what to do and when they eventually resolved to do something entirely dependent on the Ulster Unionists, that is to say, the third umpire. And as he dithered, everyone criticised. Shortly thereafter, the Tory party imploded into irrelevance. </p> <p>And last week that grandee of umpires, Dickie Bird, predicted that by October there would be no need for umpires. Now Dickie has no known form as a predictor of trends, but he can't always be wrong. And it is safe to say that it is not the most propitious time to be considering becoming an umpire. Which is exactly what Bill Athey is contemplating. Athey, numerous England caps, more than 20 years a cricket pro, three years a coach, is about to sit the exam that will enable him to become an umpire. </p> <p>We meet at the cafe at Worcester station - not too far from his home in the Herefordshire countryside. It is a suitably anonymous spot to catch up with someone about to join such a put-upon profession. Why do it? 'The number of jobs in cricket is very limited,' says Athey. 'It's not like football where you have 92 clubs. In cricket there are only 18 and if one has just got rid of you [he was coach at Worcestershire until they terminated his contract] that leaves 17. It's a very narrow field.' </p> <p>Last month Athey and fellow professionals Tim Robinson, Richard Illingworth and Rob Bailey went on a four-day course. 'There were laws that came up and we thought \"We never knew that\" and between us we've played for about 120 years.' The lbw law? 'No, the slightly more obscure laws. Most players know the bones but the devil is in the detail.' </p> <p>So what has gone wrong recently? 'Umpiring at Test level is a tremendously hard job,' says Athey, 'which is made even more difficult by the players' attitudes and more difficult again by everything being scrutinised, not only in slow-mo but super slow-mo. Umpires are only human and their confidence can be shattered within the first half-hour of a Test.' </p> <p>And then the players take advantage? 'Well, they think we'll test this bloke out, keep shouting and he'll give something. It happens in village cricket. It happens everywhere. Cricket has an image of it being a gentlemen's game.' He exhales, almost raises an eyebrow. 'Well, I'll leave anyone to make up their own minds after watching on television.' </p> <p>Indeed, despite all the nonsense written about the game's great traditions of honour and dignity, it has always provided opportunities for chicanery and skulduggery. The problems arise when, as with Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana years ago, matters bubble out of control. On that occasion it was Athey who stepped in between England captain and Pakistani umpire. 'When that blew up,' says Athey, 'I remember Tom Graveney being quoted as saying this has been going on for 38 years.' </p> <p>Nothing new under the sun, but time for something to be done. 'Everyone's agreed on that. The players know it, everyone knows it. The umpires feel they're the most put upon people in cricket.' Little wonder because they are placed in the invidious position of having all the responsibility and none of the power. Uniquely, they are charged with keeping control of the game but have no sanctions to aid them. They can't penalise or dismiss a player, they can merely threaten to report them to the ineffectual headmaster - the match referee - after play ends for the day - a fat lot of use when it comes to defusing potentially inflammatory situations. 'There's talk about bringing in penalty points,' says Athey. 'So that if a bowler is running on the wicket intentionally then the umpire will make the \"patting for batting\" sign and award five runs extra. And if a batsman does the same thing five runs will be awarded to the fielding side.' And why stop here? Why not give the umpire a yellow and red card, so that if a player flagrantly breaks the laws of the game the umpire has the power to first caution him and then dismiss him? </p> <p>Of course, such decisions would be hard but the umpire standing in the middle would be best-placed to make them. Power would be transferred from the third umpire - who would be called upon to back up rather than overrule the umpire - to the man in the middle and the umpire would consequently have more authority and, if this is not abused, engender more respect. 'In the near future it could well happen if people keep going over the boundaries,' says Athey. 'And the players might think \"bloody hell, if I carry on like this my team might be at a disadvantage\". </p> <p>Back to the current series. 'There's no doubt the umpires have been poor but you have to look at the bigger picture. Both England and Sri Lankan batsmen have stayed at the crease after they've known they were out.' Did you ever walk? 'We're not hear to talk about that.'</p>",

They were, to continue the analogy, as hamstrung as John Major at his weakest: bereft of respect, uncertain what to do and when they eventually resolved to do something entirely dependent on the Ulster Unionists, that is to say, the third umpire. And as he dithered, everyone criticised. Shortly thereafter, the Tory party imploded into irrelevance. And last week that grandee of umpires, Dickie Bird, predicted that by October there would be no need for umpires. Now Dickie has no known form as a predictor of trends, but he can't always be wrong. And it is safe to say that it is not the most propitious time to be considering becoming an umpire. Which is exactly what Bill Athey is contemplating. Athey, numerous England caps, more than 20 years a cricket pro, three years a coach, is about to sit the exam that will enable him to become an umpire. We meet at the cafe at Worcester station - not too far from his home in the Herefordshire countryside. It is a suitably anonymous spot to catch up with someone about to join such a put-upon profession. Why do it? 'The number of jobs in cricket is very limited,' says Athey. 'It's not like football where you have 92 clubs. In cricket there are only 18 and if one has just got rid of you [he was coach at Worcestershire until they terminated his contract] that leaves 17. It's a very narrow field.' Last month Athey and fellow professionals Tim Robinson, Richard Illingworth and Rob Bailey went on a four-day course. 'There were laws that came up and we thought \"We never knew that\" and between us we've played for about 120 years.' The lbw law? 'No, the slightly more obscure laws. Most players know the bones but the devil is in the detail.' So what has gone wrong recently? 'Umpiring at Test level is a tremendously hard job,' says Athey, 'which is made even more difficult by the players' attitudes and more difficult again by everything being scrutinised, not only in slow-mo but super slow-mo. Umpires are only human and their confidence can be shattered within the first half-hour of a Test.' And then the players take advantage? 'Well, they think we'll test this bloke out, keep shouting and he'll give something. It happens in village cricket. It happens everywhere. Cricket has an image of it being a gentlemen's game.' He exhales, almost raises an eyebrow. 'Well, I'll leave anyone to make up their own minds after watching on television.' Indeed, despite all the nonsense written about the game's great traditions of honour and dignity, it has always provided opportunities for chicanery and skulduggery. The problems arise when, as with Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana years ago, matters bubble out of control. On that occasion it was Athey who stepped in between England captain and Pakistani umpire. 'When that blew up,' says Athey, 'I remember Tom Graveney being quoted as saying this has been going on for 38 years.' Nothing new under the sun, but time for something to be done. 'Everyone's agreed on that. The players know it, everyone knows it. The umpires feel they're the most put upon people in cricket.' Little wonder because they are placed in the invidious position of having all the responsibility and none of the power. Uniquely, they are charged with keeping control of the game but have no sanctions to aid them. They can't penalise or dismiss a player, they can merely threaten to report them to the ineffectual headmaster - the match referee - after play ends for the day - a fat lot of use when it comes to defusing potentially inflammatory situations. 'There's talk about bringing in penalty points,' says Athey. 'So that if a bowler is running on the wicket intentionally then the umpire will make the \"patting for batting\" sign and award five runs extra. And if a batsman does the same thing five runs will be awarded to the fielding side.' And why stop here? Why not give the umpire a yellow and red card, so that if a player flagrantly breaks the laws of the game the umpire has the power to first caution him and then dismiss him? Of course, such decisions would be hard but the umpire standing in the middle would be best-placed to make them. Power would be transferred from the third umpire - who would be called upon to back up rather than overrule the umpire - to the man in the middle and the umpire would consequently have more authority and, if this is not abused, engender more respect. 'In the near future it could well happen if people keep going over the boundaries,' says Athey. 'And the players might think \"bloody hell, if I carry on like this my team might be at a disadvantage\". Back to the current series. 'There's no doubt the umpires have been poor but you have to look at the bigger picture. Both England and Sri Lankan batsmen have stayed at the crease after they've known they were out.' Did you ever walk? 'We're not hear to talk about that.'",

      "body": "<p>A friend in her late thirties confides that she intends to end a four-month relationship with a man who initially came round to plaster her living room ceiling. 'We have nothing to talk about,' she announces. 'No common ground. We do have very good sex - and I'll miss that - but I would like to have very good sex with someone I can talk to afterwards.'</p> <p>Sounds reasonable. I wonder when she intends to inform him that his services are no longer required. 'In three or four weeks.' Three or four weeks having sex - even very good sex - with someone with whom you cannot communicate sounds like stretching it a bit. I suggest she deals with it sooner (these things are never easy, but cruel to be kind and all that). She explains: 'He's putting up shelves. I'll wait until he's done the bedroom because it's driving me nuts, having nowhere to put my magazines.' How we howl. I am reminded of my three-year stint as editor of more! magazine in the mid-Nineties, largely spent inventing features along the lines of 'Useful jobs for a boyfriend to have' and jacking up sales with supplements with titles such as 'Men: A User's Guide'. The whole premise was that men were to tease, have fun and frolic with; not 'please' or 'turn on' or crowbar into commitment as the previous generation of women's magazines had kindly instructed us. The editorial team - in their early twenties, like our readers - dreamed up 'features'; games involving the staff consuming enormous quantities of alcohol and pouncing on men enjoying quiet after-work drinks. On one occasion, the sole male staffer was 'auctioned off' and dispatched on a trip to the States with a young female reader who yelped with delight at having 'won' him. Which is precisely how young women are supposed to behave. We were raised on Just Seventeen - all cockiness and no-messing sex advice - not Jackie, in which agony aunts Cathie and Claire would sternly warn readers not to 'go too far' or 'let' boys fiddle with the clasps of their teen bras. The remainder of the magazine consisted of tips on \u00efgetting him to notice you', implying an awful lot of time dawdling about on drizzly football pitches, batting eyelashes hopefully.</p> <p>In the Corinthian, a vast, ornate bar off George Square in Glasgow, there is major hair, make-up and flirtation going on. I meet a lively group of women. 'The older I get, the more picky I'm becoming,' says Jill Riddiford, a 36-year-old actress. 'The other night, a gay male friend and I were discussing how intolerant we'd become: how we ruled out men who were rude to waitresses or bank clerks, who were badly dressed, or too well-dressed' Jill has been single for three years and says: 'If you're not interested in marriage or children - and I'm not - you don't have that pressure to do the expected thing. The beginnings of relationships are great, that heady rapture, all that adrenaline flying around, but it's not a state that lasts. You can derive that excitement from other places like landing a great job.' Her friend Adele, 39, who works in market research, is on the verge of moving in with her partner of eight months. She is pragmatic about the arrangement: 'We met, like each other and I was looking for a flat - I feel OK about it. But I've been married before and am more cynical, less naive.' Comparing her current attitude to her younger self, she reasons: 'Now, I look for certain qualities - intelligence, humour - rather than just putting up with stuff. I think, does he make me laugh or bore me to death?' Adele admits that, if a relationship is not working, she is 'completely honest' and ended one liaison with a quick call to his mobile. She says: 'If I don't have children it's not the end of the world. I wouldn't feel out of the norm. And I wouldn't rule out bringing up a child on my own, if that's how things work out; a baby would have a good life with me.' In the next booth, a cluster of women in their late twenties swivel round in unison when a waiter brings a note from a group of men at the bar. Watching, amused, is Mags, a 29-year-old full-time mother whose 10-year-marriage ended at Christmas. 'Do women use men? Of course. They want to have their wicked way exactly in the way that men do,' she says. Mags concedes that she might 'catch someone's eye and get talking \u00dc if it happens, it happens. I don't want to get married again and I have two children so I could just do with a laugh, to be honest'.</p> <p>Joan Smith, author of Moralities: Sex, Money &amp; Power in the 21st Century believes that, rather than 'using' men, women are simply having lots of different types of relationships. 'When I was growing up, there was a clear template: date boys, get engaged, get married, have kids - and a relationship for life. It was how life worked. It doesn't any more. Women don't necessarily want men as partners in child rearing. Some like going out with lots of men; others want a passionate engagement with one person. There is no one pattern. It's a fantastically fluid situation.' In researching her book, Single and Loving It, author Wendy Bristow encountered two distinct attitudes: 'The man-obsessed 'he hasn't phoned\" type and the phenomenally sussed woman who wants sex on a first date because, if the sex isn't good, she doesn't want to know.' One woman in her thirties told Bristow: 'Frankly I'd rather find out at the beginning than mess about and shilly-shally and be let down in the end. I've slept with 10 men and half of them have been bad in bed. That's 50 per cent of men. They were all lovely men, but no use in bed.' Bristow believes that the latter group of women 'aren't sex mad - just practical. We're seeing it across all ages. Women in their forties have had the big relationship, and look what happened. They love sex and miss it when they don\u00cdt have it but don't necessarily want to live with a partner.' She reports that the late twenties/early thirties bracket appears to be 'the vulnerable group - more concerned with finding 'the one'. Increasing divorce rates affect the expectations of young, single women. 'The splitting-up of your parents inevitably brings down your own expectations of marriage,' says Bristow. 'We are seeing less of a desire to have a man at all costs. Most of the women I met in their twenties appeared fantastically confident, and many are not interested in a relationship. They just want lots of nice sex.' No-strings sex is a viable option. I left home at 17 to live in Dundee and hooked up with a gang of women who had arrived from various corners of England and Scotland. It was a heady, busy time; more phone numbers scribbled on hands than peering hopefully into jewellers' shops. A colleague from that time points out: 'We had absolutely no one to please but ourselves. The fact that we had escaped our parents' clutches meant there were no real restrictions on our behaviour. You wouldn't have been quite so eager to have a man in your flat if your mother was likely to turn up next day, banging on your door with a casserole.' We are more mobile, and richer than ever before. Between 1986 and 1998, an extra 15 per cent of women joined the workplace. We are choosing to have fewer children, later in life \u00dc if we have them at all. A report by the Henley Centre on behalf of the Salvation Army predicts that, of all women born in 1972, just under 25 per cent will remain childless at 45 by the year 2017 (compared with 16 per cent in 1997). David Weeks, neuropsychologist at Royal Edinburgh Hospital and author of Superyoung, points out that both genders are ageing more slowly. 'We are seeing an extension of adolescence - physically and emotionally - and postponement of emotional development.' According to Weeks, there is a marked increase in the number of sexual partners and range of sexual experimentation during the 10 years after puberty. The 2001 Durex report reveals that 16 to 20-year-olds were 15 on average when they first had sex; over-45s were 18. 'Morality is not perceived in the same way as in previous generations,' says Weeks. 'The parents of women in their twenties and thirties - post-war baby-boomers - had comparatively easy lives and a desire to protect and do whatever they could for their children. Smaller families meant that those children could be indulged. We moved into a more permissive society.' Weeks believes that women still want emotional security, \u00efbut are less concerned with formalising it and more likely to formulate their own ideas of trust and responsibility. Women are taking advantage of freedom that, until now, they have never had in such abundance'. Back in the Corinthian, Julie, a 25-year-old law student, has had 'serious' relationships since she was 15. She and her partner of three years split up recently and she is badgering her friend Elise to leave the bar and go dancing. 'I can't stand a night in. I'm out, flirting with millions of men, ripping the piss out of them \u00dc being a total bitch really.' To boost her ego? 'No.' For sex? She looks aghast. 'I don't do that. Some women do. I just lead men on. Tease them a bit. They should be able to take it.'</p> <p>Ben Renshaw, author of Success But Something Missing, believes that women want what they have seen men having in the past. 'Given the fact that women are more emotionally mature than men of a similar age, they are perhaps better equipped at playing the dating game and handling it well.' Renshaw adds that women's increased earning power and associated work commitments mean that 'time is at a premium. Women are less prepared to put up with relationships that are clearly not working - and freedom is a highly prized commodity'. Hardly surprising, then, that we are seeing a decline in agony aunts' advice on snaring a man and hauling him, yelping for mummy, to choose flowers and agree on the order of service. I ask Karen McKee, a single 30-year-old advertising assistant at Radio Clyde, how she would react if a partner appeared to be steering her towards marriage and Mothercare. 'Panic. Friends used to say, 'Wait until you're 30 and you'll change your mind\"; here I am, 30, and I haven't.' She has been the one to end most of her relationships: 'I always seem to do the splitting-up. I'm straightforward about it; I don't believe in playing games. I'm not willing to put up with nonsense.' Karen acknowledges that she and her peers have a different - though not necessarily easier - agenda than that of their parents: 'My mother was married at 21 and had me at 24. That's what you did then. Divorce no longer has a stigma attached; friends are more likely to say, 'You've done the right thing. Good on you.' Single for three years, she says: 'Meeting a man is not top priority right now. I'm doing an OU degree and have dance classes and I'm learning piano. I don't need a man to boost my ego. My family, my sister, and two or three close friends do that.' While women's magazines such as Cosmopolitan still regularly include features such as 'Power Flirting' - including the tip 'squeeze gently with both hands while gently shaking it', which as it turns out is advice on giving a good handshake \u00dc they also advise on landing a job, friends and party invitations as well as (naturally) a man. Rita Lewis, publishing director of Marie Claire, says: 'Emotional features are more of a feel-good read than a real guide as to how to cope. They are needed less as women are open to more ways of living than the traditional baby-boomer fantasy. Marie Claire assumes the reader is more in control and less often in victim mode. A good example is 'All the men I slept with' [February 2001].\u00cd In the feature, 20-year-old Yolanda, reunited with six ex-lovers, says, 'I do feel like a slapper seeing all my exes together, but I also like the idea that I've had them all.' But certain comments from her sexual partners - 'Yolanda is up for anything: I can see that by looking at the other blokes she's slept with (Mark, 35)' and 'My mum wouldn't like Yolanda: she's way too forward (Carl, 25)' - imply that even the men with whom she has had sex do not wholly approve of her behaviour. At my secondary school, in the late Seventies/early Eighties, a more terrifying prospect than developing a throbbing spot on school disco night was gaining a reputation. Sex felt dark and scary \u00dc the prospect of all that fun and fumbling marred by rumours that you could get pregnant by having a bath after your brother and, weirdly, passing a boy on the stairs. Good girl didn't, and bad girl \u00dc well, we knew what she'd been up to with that blob of toothpaste on her neck, \u00efhealing' a lovebite. From meeting readers of more!, I know that today's young women are less hung up about supposed good/bad behaviour. The Durex Report 2000 reveals that 40 per cent of women using condoms take the responsibility for buying the condoms themselves. I witnessed a fantastically direct pick-up recently. A (single) male friend and I were having drinks when an attractive woman in her late thirties glided up to him, as if on casters. 'Your boyfriend?' she asked me courteously, before charming him with enviable speed and efficiency and swiftly steering him into a taxi. The following morning I conjured up some creaky excuse to call him. 'I feel used,' he complained. 'She didn't even ask for my phone number.' From where I was standing it sounded ideal; convenient sex with no 'I'll call you' and subsequent call-screening endeavours. 'It's nice to meet a woman who knows her onions, but she was so macho,' he finished, lamely. Leading sex therapist Martin Cole acknowledges that the female sex drive equals a man's, eventually exceeding it: 'The male libido kicks in at around 14, rising rapidly to 18. There\u00cds a plateau throughout his twenties, then - as he calms down and becomes more discerning - a gradual decline.' Women, on the other hand, rev up with age: 'As a woman grows older, she generally finds it easier to orgasm, so sex becomes more fulfilling.' Yet, according to Joan Smith, casual sex - at least women enjoying casual sex \u00dc is still frowned upon. 'Our culture undervalues women. There is a tendency to look at men kindly - at a man in his fifties being still sexually attractive - yet a woman who is single and having fun in her forties shouldn't be doing this. It's an inhibiting factor.' In my close circle of half a dozen friends, all admit that casual sex can be a useful exercise in itself and less hassle than going to the gym. 'It's an ego boost,' says one. 'A nice opportunity to show off,' adds another. One friend keeps an ex-partner 'in reserve for when I haven't had sex in maybe a month and it's becoming a bit dull going home on my own. We meet for drinks and I'll go back to his place. The first couple of times after we'd split up he'd go through the motions of making up the spare bed for me. Now we just sleep together. There's no bashing around with spare duvets. I've been emotionally involved with him and don't want that again, but the sex is kind of cosy and familiar.' Another long-term single friend confesses, 'I'm a great believer in the 'barrier bonk'. When you've come out of a long relationship, and you're not too confident about yourself sexually, a barrier bonk starts everything up and working again, helping you get a bit of practice in.' Interestingly, in the changing behaviour of women, culture and biology might clash, since biologically, it seems, we are not programmed to behave in this manner. Dr Weeks says the hormone oxytocin is released in women during sex: 'While it is usually linked with breastfeeding - and the suppression of sexual desire - in small quantities it creates feelings of warmth and intimacy, reinforcing a woman's feelings for her partner by association.' The ratio of women joining internet dating agencies is growing. However, Danny Smith at www.midsummerseve.com, says, 'You will find fewer women attaching photos to their profiles than men. Women seem to prefer to look out for a chap they like the look of and then make the first move - rather than allowing any number of strange men contact them.' Mary Balfour, at the introduction agency Drawing Down the Moon, has launched a new dating service, Only Lunch, 'for those who want to meet casually, perhaps just for an hour. You're not giving up an evening'. There is mileage inthe 'low-pressure package', Balfour believes. 'It is becoming increasingly difficult to find a mate; the old matchmaking routes - extended family, factory floor - have long gone. Women do not necessarily want to meet a man to live with; we saw the big cohabitation boom through the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties - a rebellion against the old ideals. Now there is nothing to rebel against.' According to Balfour, women are also becoming more picky: \u00efWomen want men who are sorted emotionally and have worked a bit on themselves. Both sexes tend to look for a partner who is on a higher level of attraction. We call it FSI - faulty self-image. That is, believing that you are more attractive than you actually are.' I met Toni (not her real name), at a Christmas party. Two years previously, she had responded to a personal ad 'initially for sex because I had been single for four years and it just wasn't happening through the usual channels like work or in bars'. She embarked on a relationship with one man. Keen to have a child, she plotted her fertile days with Persona and became pregnant within three months. When we spoke, the child was nearing her first birthday and Toni was contemplating separating from the father. 'There is fondness there but we are utterly different in our interests and aspirations. I have my daughter. I can support her without my partner's help. I am just a little put off at the thought of lurching into that going out and meeting men thing all over again. It's a lot of effort.' Dating is becoming trickier. Status is harder to define. Joan Smith toys with the following labels, 'technically single - as I live alone but have boyfriends; single not celibate - it hardly fits on a census form'. Our mother and grandmothers simply had their pick of single, married, divorced, spinster. 'Now we have partners who are not boyfriends but whom we like or even love,' she adds.</p> <p>It is 1.30am in the Corinthian. A woman from the table who received the mysterious note repeatedly bounds towards the men at the bar, whispering in ears and patting thighs until a waiter requests - with extreme courtesy - that she leaves them alone. Elise, 26, watches and laughs. Meanwhile, Julie is growing impatient. She wants to move on and for Elise to accompany her. I wonder if Julie's night has been successful so far. I remember her vow to flirt with 'millions' of men. She shrugs and touches up make-up. Evidently, the night is young. She leads Elise to the door, announcing: 'We're going dancing.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "A friend in her late thirties confides that she intends to end a four-month relationship with a man who initially came round to plaster her living room ceiling. 'We have nothing to talk about,' she announces. 'No common ground. We do have very good sex - and I'll miss that - but I would like to have very good sex with someone I can talk to afterwards.' Sounds reasonable. I wonder when she intends to inform him that his services are no longer required. 'In three or four weeks.' Three or four weeks having sex - even very good sex - with someone with whom you cannot communicate sounds like stretching it a bit. I suggest she deals with it sooner (these things are never easy, but cruel to be kind and all that). She explains: 'He's putting up shelves. I'll wait until he's done the bedroom because it's driving me nuts, having nowhere to put my magazines.' How we howl. I am reminded of my three-year stint as editor of more! magazine in the mid-Nineties, largely spent inventing features along the lines of 'Useful jobs for a boyfriend to have' and jacking up sales with supplements with titles such as 'Men: A User's Guide'. The whole premise was that men were to tease, have fun and frolic with; not 'please' or 'turn on' or crowbar into commitment as the previous generation of women's magazines had kindly instructed us. The editorial team - in their early twenties, like our readers - dreamed up 'features'; games involving the staff consuming enormous quantities of alcohol and pouncing on men enjoying quiet after-work drinks. On one occasion, the sole male staffer was 'auctioned off' and dispatched on a trip to the States with a young female reader who yelped with delight at having 'won' him. Which is precisely how young women are supposed to behave. We were raised on Just Seventeen - all cockiness and no-messing sex advice - not Jackie, in which agony aunts Cathie and Claire would sternly warn readers not to 'go too far' or 'let' boys fiddle with the clasps of their teen bras. The remainder of the magazine consisted of tips on \u00efgetting him to notice you', implying an awful lot of time dawdling about on drizzly football pitches, batting eyelashes hopefully. In the Corinthian, a vast, ornate bar off George Square in Glasgow, there is major hair, make-up and flirtation going on. I meet a lively group of women. 'The older I get, the more picky I'm becoming,' says Jill Riddiford, a 36-year-old actress. 'The other night, a gay male friend and I were discussing how intolerant we'd become: how we ruled out men who were rude to waitresses or bank clerks, who were badly dressed, or too well-dressed' Jill has been single for three years and says: 'If you're not interested in marriage or children - and I'm not - you don't have that pressure to do the expected thing. The beginnings of relationships are great, that heady rapture, all that adrenaline flying around, but it's not a state that lasts. You can derive that excitement from other places like landing a great job.' Her friend Adele, 39, who works in market research, is on the verge of moving in with her partner of eight months. She is pragmatic about the arrangement: 'We met, like each other and I was looking for a flat - I feel OK about it. But I've been married before and am more cynical, less naive.' Comparing her current attitude to her younger self, she reasons: 'Now, I look for certain qualities - intelligence, humour - rather than just putting up with stuff. I think, does he make me laugh or bore me to death?' Adele admits that, if a relationship is not working, she is 'completely honest' and ended one liaison with a quick call to his mobile. She says: 'If I don't have children it's not the end of the world. I wouldn't feel out of the norm. And I wouldn't rule out bringing up a child on my own, if that's how things work out; a baby would have a good life with me.' In the next booth, a cluster of women in their late twenties swivel round in unison when a waiter brings a note from a group of men at the bar. Watching, amused, is Mags, a 29-year-old full-time mother whose 10-year-marriage ended at Christmas. 'Do women use men? Of course. They want to have their wicked way exactly in the way that men do,' she says. Mags concedes that she might 'catch someone's eye and get talking \u00dc if it happens, it happens. I don't want to get married again and I have two children so I could just do with a laugh, to be honest'. Joan Smith, author of Moralities: Sex, Money &amp; Power in the 21st Century believes that, rather than 'using' men, women are simply having lots of different types of relationships. 'When I was growing up, there was a clear template: date boys, get engaged, get married, have kids - and a relationship for life. It was how life worked. It doesn't any more. Women don't necessarily want men as partners in child rearing. Some like going out with lots of men; others want a passionate engagement with one person. There is no one pattern. It's a fantastically fluid situation.' In researching her book, Single and Loving It, author Wendy Bristow encountered two distinct attitudes: 'The man-obsessed 'he hasn't phoned\" type and the phenomenally sussed woman who wants sex on a first date because, if the sex isn't good, she doesn't want to know.' One woman in her thirties told Bristow: 'Frankly I'd rather find out at the beginning than mess about and shilly-shally and be let down in the end. I've slept with 10 men and half of them have been bad in bed. That's 50 per cent of men. They were all lovely men, but no use in bed.' Bristow believes that the latter group of women 'aren't sex mad - just practical. We're seeing it across all ages. Women in their forties have had the big relationship, and look what happened. They love sex and miss it when they don\u00cdt have it but don't necessarily want to live with a partner.' She reports that the late twenties/early thirties bracket appears to be 'the vulnerable group - more concerned with finding 'the one'. Increasing divorce rates affect the expectations of young, single women. 'The splitting-up of your parents inevitably brings down your own expectations of marriage,' says Bristow. 'We are seeing less of a desire to have a man at all costs. Most of the women I met in their twenties appeared fantastically confident, and many are not interested in a relationship. They just want lots of nice sex.' No-strings sex is a viable option. I left home at 17 to live in Dundee and hooked up with a gang of women who had arrived from various corners of England and Scotland. It was a heady, busy time; more phone numbers scribbled on hands than peering hopefully into jewellers' shops. A colleague from that time points out: 'We had absolutely no one to please but ourselves. The fact that we had escaped our parents' clutches meant there were no real restrictions on our behaviour. You wouldn't have been quite so eager to have a man in your flat if your mother was likely to turn up next day, banging on your door with a casserole.' We are more mobile, and richer than ever before. Between 1986 and 1998, an extra 15 per cent of women joined the workplace. We are choosing to have fewer children, later in life \u00dc if we have them at all. A report by the Henley Centre on behalf of the Salvation Army predicts that, of all women born in 1972, just under 25 per cent will remain childless at 45 by the year 2017 (compared with 16 per cent in 1997). David Weeks, neuropsychologist at Royal Edinburgh Hospital and author of Superyoung, points out that both genders are ageing more slowly. 'We are seeing an extension of adolescence - physically and emotionally - and postponement of emotional development.' According to Weeks, there is a marked increase in the number of sexual partners and range of sexual experimentation during the 10 years after puberty. The 2001 Durex report reveals that 16 to 20-year-olds were 15 on average when they first had sex; over-45s were 18. 'Morality is not perceived in the same way as in previous generations,' says Weeks. 'The parents of women in their twenties and thirties - post-war baby-boomers - had comparatively easy lives and a desire to protect and do whatever they could for their children. Smaller families meant that those children could be indulged. We moved into a more permissive society.' Weeks believes that women still want emotional security, \u00efbut are less concerned with formalising it and more likely to formulate their own ideas of trust and responsibility. Women are taking advantage of freedom that, until now, they have never had in such abundance'. Back in the Corinthian, Julie, a 25-year-old law student, has had 'serious' relationships since she was 15. She and her partner of three years split up recently and she is badgering her friend Elise to leave the bar and go dancing. 'I can't stand a night in. I'm out, flirting with millions of men, ripping the piss out of them \u00dc being a total bitch really.' To boost her ego? 'No.' For sex? She looks aghast. 'I don't do that. Some women do. I just lead men on. Tease them a bit. They should be able to take it.' Ben Renshaw, author of Success But Something Missing, believes that women want what they have seen men having in the past. 'Given the fact that women are more emotionally mature than men of a similar age, they are perhaps better equipped at playing the dating game and handling it well.' Renshaw adds that women's increased earning power and associated work commitments mean that 'time is at a premium. Women are less prepared to put up with relationships that are clearly not working - and freedom is a highly prized commodity'. Hardly surprising, then, that we are seeing a decline in agony aunts' advice on snaring a man and hauling him, yelping for mummy, to choose flowers and agree on the order of service. I ask Karen McKee, a single 30-year-old advertising assistant at Radio Clyde, how she would react if a partner appeared to be steering her towards marriage and Mothercare. 'Panic. Friends used to say, 'Wait until you're 30 and you'll change your mind\"; here I am, 30, and I haven't.' She has been the one to end most of her relationships: 'I always seem to do the splitting-up. I'm straightforward about it; I don't believe in playing games. I'm not willing to put up with nonsense.' Karen acknowledges that she and her peers have a different - though not necessarily easier - agenda than that of their parents: 'My mother was married at 21 and had me at 24. That's what you did then. Divorce no longer has a stigma attached; friends are more likely to say, 'You've done the right thing. Good on you.' Single for three years, she says: 'Meeting a man is not top priority right now. I'm doing an OU degree and have dance classes and I'm learning piano. I don't need a man to boost my ego. My family, my sister, and two or three close friends do that.' While women's magazines such as Cosmopolitan still regularly include features such as 'Power Flirting' - including the tip 'squeeze gently with both hands while gently shaking it', which as it turns out is advice on giving a good handshake \u00dc they also advise on landing a job, friends and party invitations as well as (naturally) a man. Rita Lewis, publishing director of Marie Claire, says: 'Emotional features are more of a feel-good read than a real guide as to how to cope. They are needed less as women are open to more ways of living than the traditional baby-boomer fantasy. Marie Claire assumes the reader is more in control and less often in victim mode. A good example is 'All the men I slept with' [February 2001].\u00cd In the feature, 20-year-old Yolanda, reunited with six ex-lovers, says, 'I do feel like a slapper seeing all my exes together, but I also like the idea that I've had them all.' But certain comments from her sexual partners - 'Yolanda is up for anything: I can see that by looking at the other blokes she's slept with (Mark, 35)' and 'My mum wouldn't like Yolanda: she's way too forward (Carl, 25)' - imply that even the men with whom she has had sex do not wholly approve of her behaviour. At my secondary school, in the late Seventies/early Eighties, a more terrifying prospect than developing a throbbing spot on school disco night was gaining a reputation. Sex felt dark and scary \u00dc the prospect of all that fun and fumbling marred by rumours that you could get pregnant by having a bath after your brother and, weirdly, passing a boy on the stairs. Good girl didn't, and bad girl \u00dc well, we knew what she'd been up to with that blob of toothpaste on her neck, \u00efhealing' a lovebite. From meeting readers of more!, I know that today's young women are less hung up about supposed good/bad behaviour. The Durex Report 2000 reveals that 40 per cent of women using condoms take the responsibility for buying the condoms themselves. I witnessed a fantastically direct pick-up recently. A (single) male friend and I were having drinks when an attractive woman in her late thirties glided up to him, as if on casters. 'Your boyfriend?' she asked me courteously, before charming him with enviable speed and efficiency and swiftly steering him into a taxi. The following morning I conjured up some creaky excuse to call him. 'I feel used,' he complained. 'She didn't even ask for my phone number.' From where I was standing it sounded ideal; convenient sex with no 'I'll call you' and subsequent call-screening endeavours. 'It's nice to meet a woman who knows her onions, but she was so macho,' he finished, lamely. Leading sex therapist Martin Cole acknowledges that the female sex drive equals a man's, eventually exceeding it: 'The male libido kicks in at around 14, rising rapidly to 18. There\u00cds a plateau throughout his twenties, then - as he calms down and becomes more discerning - a gradual decline.' Women, on the other hand, rev up with age: 'As a woman grows older, she generally finds it easier to orgasm, so sex becomes more fulfilling.' Yet, according to Joan Smith, casual sex - at least women enjoying casual sex \u00dc is still frowned upon. 'Our culture undervalues women. There is a tendency to look at men kindly - at a man in his fifties being still sexually attractive - yet a woman who is single and having fun in her forties shouldn't be doing this. It's an inhibiting factor.' In my close circle of half a dozen friends, all admit that casual sex can be a useful exercise in itself and less hassle than going to the gym. 'It's an ego boost,' says one. 'A nice opportunity to show off,' adds another. One friend keeps an ex-partner 'in reserve for when I haven't had sex in maybe a month and it's becoming a bit dull going home on my own. We meet for drinks and I'll go back to his place. The first couple of times after we'd split up he'd go through the motions of making up the spare bed for me. Now we just sleep together. There's no bashing around with spare duvets. I've been emotionally involved with him and don't want that again, but the sex is kind of cosy and familiar.' Another long-term single friend confesses, 'I'm a great believer in the 'barrier bonk'. When you've come out of a long relationship, and you're not too confident about yourself sexually, a barrier bonk starts everything up and working again, helping you get a bit of practice in.' Interestingly, in the changing behaviour of women, culture and biology might clash, since biologically, it seems, we are not programmed to behave in this manner. Dr Weeks says the hormone oxytocin is released in women during sex: 'While it is usually linked with breastfeeding - and the suppression of sexual desire - in small quantities it creates feelings of warmth and intimacy, reinforcing a woman's feelings for her partner by association.' The ratio of women joining internet dating agencies is growing. However, Danny Smith at www.midsummerseve.com, says, 'You will find fewer women attaching photos to their profiles than men.

      "body": "<p>Ross is 17 years old. He plays in a band called Macer. His best friend Matthew, also 17, says that the band is going to be massive. Ashley is a year younger. He's not that bothered about the music, if he's honest, but he's still there at the foot of the stage, moshing with Matthew. Hip-hop is his life, he says, but he'll do anything for a laugh. Wayne, 17, says his liver hurts, so he's taking it easy tonight. Yesterday he was on work experience at Cash Generator, an electrical goods store, in Pontypridd. He sold a DVD to a woman who came in for a hairdryer.</p> <p>All four are big music fans. 'I hate Eminem, though,'sneers Ashley, who rates the late rapper Tupac Shakur highest of all. 'I just don't believe in Eminem. He's a bad boy with a chainsaw onstage at his concerts, then he's a little kid with glasses in court.' Ross's creative influences jump straight off the pages of the New Musical Express - the Beatles, Jeff Buckley, Nirvana, Massive Attack. 'I'd rather see the up-and-coming bands at Clwb Ifor Bach [a fashionable Cardiff small venue] than the stadium bands,' he explains. Porth has a population of just 6,500. It charted at 199 in a report published last year by the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation; 198 places were worse off, 601 were better. Breaking the figures down, Porth would appear to be relatively free of child deprivation, and good on education and housing. Yes, the heavy industry has long gone and unemployment is higher than the national average (the figure for Rhondda Cynon Taff county borough is 0.2 per cent higher than the Welsh average of 4.5 per cent). But as the people from Porth can see, by surveying places just a mile or two away, things could be worse. With no knowledge of these statistics, Ross offers his own, far more succinct, analysis of the situation. 'Everyone's the same,' he says, with a shrug. 'Nobody's loaded, but nobody's living in poverty either. I like it here.' Ross, Matthew and Wayne are sixth-formers at Porth County Comprehensive, studying movement and drama A-level. Much to Ross's annoyance, there's no music department, but there is a cybercafe - though none of the boys seem overly interested in the computer hardware at hand. 'I'll send emails and go to chat rooms when I'm at home,' admits Matthew, 'but there's this group of nerds in school who are obsessed with Bill Gates.' They've noticed a lot more people staying on for sixth-form studies these days. The school no longer just concentrates on academic subjects, explains Matthew. 'They want people to stay on and make a bit more of themselves.' The boys have part-time jobs. Ross works in Somerfield in nearby Tonypandy, Ashley does the odd cash-in-hand job for his dad, who fits suspended ceilings, while Matthew helps out at 'The Res', Trealaw's Sports and Social Club. Wayne just got turned down for a job at Bachettas in Porth, one of the few Italian cafes remaining in the Rhondda. 'They said blokes aren't reliable enough,' he says indignantly. Wayne plays football for Porth Senior Seconds, AFC Rhondda under-17s and AFC Rhondda Senior Seconds. Ross works on his music. There's not a lot of time for mooching about. 'We don't see as much of each other as we used to,' admits Ashley, 'because of girlfriends and working an' that.' Still a few months away from a driving licence and the promise of bowling alleys and multiplex cinemas further afield, the four limit their socialising to Porth and the surrounding villages. The geographical intensity of the area breeds local rivalries. Trealaw, where Ross and Matthew live, has a rough reputation locally. So does Trebanog, Wayne's home patch. Lads from each village look after their own. A symbolic example of this is the annual battle which used to take place over a bridge between Dinas and Trealaw. 'The story goes that there\u00cds always been arguments over whose bridge it is,' explains Matthew. 'You'd have 10, 11-year olds, right up to 17, 18 fighting every St David's Day. Trealaw always had the advantage because we were up on the bank and we'd just pile them with stones.' Nobody knows of any boxing clubs around. Everybody's into martial arts these days. 'Bodybuilding is popular,' says Ross. 'You'd be surprised how many people our age are into steroids and that,' nods Matthew. 'They want to be big.' 'This comes from the guy who wanted to give up drink to keep his six-pack, by the way,' laughs Ross.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, Matthew, Ashley, Ross and Wayne would have spent Friday night knocking back a few cans of beer in Trealaw Cemetery before trying their luck in a local pub or club. Occasionally they'd get stopped by police and have their booze poured into the gutter. 'Or sometimes the cops would just put it in the boot of the car and take it back to the station,' recalls Matthew with a smile. 'They'd give you this handwritten note, nothing official, just on an A4 piece of paper.' Ross and Co now spend their leisure time in pubs, although they are underage. 'But we don't get any hassle. It's money in their pocket, no matter where it comes from,' says Ross. 'It's not just to get hammered. Sometimes we'll go in for a game of pool and a pint,' continues Matthew. 'Then sometimes I go after work on a Sunday just to watch the rugby highlights, to relax. It's my dad's local, so they don't mind. But when you get younger kids going, that's when the owners start taking notice. Our parents don\u00cdt mind. I've got my mobile on me, so if it gets really late, around three or something, then she'll phone me.' Occasionally, Matthew's mother will stay up until he gets home, just to make sure he's all right. There seems to be enough common ground between the generations to allow a certain level of trust and understanding. Surprisingly, perhaps, the boys have few complaints about their parents. Offering up something of a statistical anomaly, all four boys are from nuclear families. 'Generally, I think our parents understand the difference between their lives when they were teenagers and ours,' states Ross. 'That's one of the main reasons we get on OK.' 'They want us to turn out better than they did, in a way,' observes Matthew. 'They want us to go off to university. We've got more choices than our parents had.' 'There's more expected of us, though,' adds Ross.</p> <p>When we pop back to Matthew's house, unannounced, after an afternoon at the Res watching the Wales v Scotland Six Nations match, he opens the living room door to find his mother and friends and neighbours screaming with laughter. 'You don't want to go in there,' he laughs, ushering me upstairs to his room. 'Someone's in there, walking around the room wearing my boxer shorts.' Of course, they still get pulled up by their parents over phone bills and spending too much money. As for drugs,the boys say they don't use them but know enough to make an educated decision either way. Socially, they say, it's a loser's game - hanging about in shabby company, getting involved in violent crime. They know plenty of people who take ecstasy, particularly those who go on clubbing jaunts to Cardiff. 'I can't see the point,myself,' says Matthew, flatly. 'You wouldn't really want to take it round here, anyway, because there's not a lot of use getting that excited about things.' One complaint is that parents never seem to understand the idea of being 'friends' with a girl. Small wonder, considering the level of teenage pregnancy in the area. Statistics for outer London in 1996-98 showed an average of 42 pregnancies per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 17. In Rhondda Cynon Taff there were 68.7 per 1,000.</p> <p>A girl in Matthew's street had had two children before her sixteenth birthday. By the time the second was born, the father of both was in prison. Even without being fed the facts, Ross is uncharacteristically judgmental. 'People in this community are more irresponsible, definitely,' he states. 'They're just so isolated in their upbringing. People are having sex a lot younger, to impress their mates or pretend they're more mature than they actually are.' 'Why they're getting pregnant ,though, is anyone's guess,' adds Matthew. 'It's not like we're short on advice about contraception.' Friday night upstairs at the Rhondda Hotel. The poster in the window advertises Macer's second gig, supporting local band Nine Mile Burn. Everyone's there in support including Ross's girlfriend Sarah, who's a couple of years older than him, and her livewire friend Debbie. She wears a tight black T-shirt printed with the words: \u00efI hate boys, but I love men.' There's a New Year's Eve air about proceedings; it feels like a special occasion. The girls are dressed up - mock Burberry, silky trousers, hair gelled into place. The boys are smart-casual, trying hard to look like they're not trying too hard. Everybody's hugging one minute and grappling the next, looking for half an excuse for some kind of playful physical interaction with a member of the opposite sex. Ashley's showing off his dancing biceps, Wayne challenges him to an arm-wrestling competition and beats him every time. Wayne's holding court about his work experience at Cash Generator. 'They took a grand today and I reckon I did almost half of that. I could make a fortune, I reckon.' Matthew and Ashley, meanwhile, are full of enthusiasm. 'Macer: remember the name,' says Matthew. 'In years to come you'll be telling people you saw them before they were famous.' A member of Nine Mile Burn's smaller entourage, probably 10 years older, looks on with a wry look as he discreetly rolls a joint out of sight of the management. The gig is like a stadium performance in miniature. The band has recorded some songs and distributed a few copies of a 'home-made' CD, so the audience is primed, bellowing every word to all four of Ross's songs, which are punctuated by covers of Nirvana and Beatles songs. After disappearing for a while with Sarah he returns to receive the plaudits and the gentle ribbing in equal measure. 'It was crap compared to last week,' he says, 'but it's what I love more than anything. I'm not that career-orientated. In a year's time I'll still be in school and hopefully the band will still be together. But beyond that, I don't know. I dream, but I don't plan.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ross is 17 years old. He plays in a band called Macer. His best friend Matthew, also 17, says that the band is going to be massive. Ashley is a year younger. He's not that bothered about the music, if he's honest, but he's still there at the foot of the stage, moshing with Matthew. Hip-hop is his life, he says, but he'll do anything for a laugh. Wayne, 17, says his liver hurts, so he's taking it easy tonight. Yesterday he was on work experience at Cash Generator, an electrical goods store, in Pontypridd. He sold a DVD to a woman who came in for a hairdryer. All four are big music fans. 'I hate Eminem, though,'sneers Ashley, who rates the late rapper Tupac Shakur highest of all. 'I just don't believe in Eminem. He's a bad boy with a chainsaw onstage at his concerts, then he's a little kid with glasses in court.' Ross's creative influences jump straight off the pages of the New Musical Express - the Beatles, Jeff Buckley, Nirvana, Massive Attack. 'I'd rather see the up-and-coming bands at Clwb Ifor Bach [a fashionable Cardiff small venue] than the stadium bands,' he explains. Porth has a population of just 6,500. It charted at 199 in a report published last year by the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation; 198 places were worse off, 601 were better. Breaking the figures down, Porth would appear to be relatively free of child deprivation, and good on education and housing. Yes, the heavy industry has long gone and unemployment is higher than the national average (the figure for Rhondda Cynon Taff county borough is 0.2 per cent higher than the Welsh average of 4.5 per cent). But as the people from Porth can see, by surveying places just a mile or two away, things could be worse. With no knowledge of these statistics, Ross offers his own, far more succinct, analysis of the situation. 'Everyone's the same,' he says, with a shrug. 'Nobody's loaded, but nobody's living in poverty either. I like it here.' Ross, Matthew and Wayne are sixth-formers at Porth County Comprehensive, studying movement and drama A-level. Much to Ross's annoyance, there's no music department, but there is a cybercafe - though none of the boys seem overly interested in the computer hardware at hand. 'I'll send emails and go to chat rooms when I'm at home,' admits Matthew, 'but there's this group of nerds in school who are obsessed with Bill Gates.' They've noticed a lot more people staying on for sixth-form studies these days. The school no longer just concentrates on academic subjects, explains Matthew. 'They want people to stay on and make a bit more of themselves.' The boys have part-time jobs. Ross works in Somerfield in nearby Tonypandy, Ashley does the odd cash-in-hand job for his dad, who fits suspended ceilings, while Matthew helps out at 'The Res', Trealaw's Sports and Social Club. Wayne just got turned down for a job at Bachettas in Porth, one of the few Italian cafes remaining in the Rhondda. 'They said blokes aren't reliable enough,' he says indignantly. Wayne plays football for Porth Senior Seconds, AFC Rhondda under-17s and AFC Rhondda Senior Seconds. Ross works on his music. There's not a lot of time for mooching about. 'We don't see as much of each other as we used to,' admits Ashley, 'because of girlfriends and working an' that.' Still a few months away from a driving licence and the promise of bowling alleys and multiplex cinemas further afield, the four limit their socialising to Porth and the surrounding villages. The geographical intensity of the area breeds local rivalries. Trealaw, where Ross and Matthew live, has a rough reputation locally. So does Trebanog, Wayne's home patch. Lads from each village look after their own. A symbolic example of this is the annual battle which used to take place over a bridge between Dinas and Trealaw. 'The story goes that there\u00cds always been arguments over whose bridge it is,' explains Matthew. 'You'd have 10, 11-year olds, right up to 17, 18 fighting every St David's Day. Trealaw always had the advantage because we were up on the bank and we'd just pile them with stones.' Nobody knows of any boxing clubs around. Everybody's into martial arts these days. 'Bodybuilding is popular,' says Ross. 'You'd be surprised how many people our age are into steroids and that,' nods Matthew. 'They want to be big.' 'This comes from the guy who wanted to give up drink to keep his six-pack, by the way,' laughs Ross. A couple of years ago, Matthew, Ashley, Ross and Wayne would have spent Friday night knocking back a few cans of beer in Trealaw Cemetery before trying their luck in a local pub or club. Occasionally they'd get stopped by police and have their booze poured into the gutter. 'Or sometimes the cops would just put it in the boot of the car and take it back to the station,' recalls Matthew with a smile. 'They'd give you this handwritten note, nothing official, just on an A4 piece of paper.' Ross and Co now spend their leisure time in pubs, although they are underage. 'But we don't get any hassle. It's money in their pocket, no matter where it comes from,' says Ross. 'It's not just to get hammered. Sometimes we'll go in for a game of pool and a pint,' continues Matthew. 'Then sometimes I go after work on a Sunday just to watch the rugby highlights, to relax. It's my dad's local, so they don't mind. But when you get younger kids going, that's when the owners start taking notice. Our parents don\u00cdt mind. I've got my mobile on me, so if it gets really late, around three or something, then she'll phone me.' Occasionally, Matthew's mother will stay up until he gets home, just to make sure he's all right. There seems to be enough common ground between the generations to allow a certain level of trust and understanding. Surprisingly, perhaps, the boys have few complaints about their parents. Offering up something of a statistical anomaly, all four boys are from nuclear families. 'Generally, I think our parents understand the difference between their lives when they were teenagers and ours,' states Ross. 'That's one of the main reasons we get on OK.' 'They want us to turn out better than they did, in a way,' observes Matthew. 'They want us to go off to university. We've got more choices than our parents had.' 'There's more expected of us, though,' adds Ross. When we pop back to Matthew's house, unannounced, after an afternoon at the Res watching the Wales v Scotland Six Nations match, he opens the living room door to find his mother and friends and neighbours screaming with laughter. 'You don't want to go in there,' he laughs, ushering me upstairs to his room. 'Someone's in there, walking around the room wearing my boxer shorts.' Of course, they still get pulled up by their parents over phone bills and spending too much money. As for drugs,the boys say they don't use them but know enough to make an educated decision either way. Socially, they say, it's a loser's game - hanging about in shabby company, getting involved in violent crime. They know plenty of people who take ecstasy, particularly those who go on clubbing jaunts to Cardiff. 'I can't see the point,myself,' says Matthew, flatly. 'You wouldn't really want to take it round here, anyway, because there's not a lot of use getting that excited about things.' One complaint is that parents never seem to understand the idea of being 'friends' with a girl. Small wonder, considering the level of teenage pregnancy in the area. Statistics for outer London in 1996-98 showed an average of 42 pregnancies per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 17. In Rhondda Cynon Taff there were 68.7 per 1,000. A girl in Matthew's street had had two children before her sixteenth birthday. By the time the second was born, the father of both was in prison. Even without being fed the facts, Ross is uncharacteristically judgmental. 'People in this community are more irresponsible, definitely,' he states. 'They're just so isolated in their upbringing. People are having sex a lot younger, to impress their mates or pretend they're more mature than they actually are.' 'Why they're getting pregnant ,though, is anyone's guess,' adds Matthew. 'It's not like we're short on advice about contraception.' Friday night upstairs at the Rhondda Hotel. The poster in the window advertises Macer's second gig, supporting local band Nine Mile Burn.

Ajamu Baraka, director of Amnesty International's US anti-death penalty programme, said: 'We have been expecting some national backlash but we feel strongly that on principal we must be as visible in the McVeigh case as any other.'",

      "body": "<p>Thursday morning and the short journey to the national radio station affords a first look at Havana, which turns out to be exactly what I was expecting, only more. Salsa rhythms collide with rock and disco in the desiccated streets. Fifties-vintage Chevys clang past, flanked by buildings which appear ready to crumble to nothingness in the face of the first stiff breeze to blow in from the Caribbean.</p> <p>Everything seems hand-tinted, washed by the sun. The only primary colours you see are worn by the prostitutes who keep hawkish watch on most street corners. You notice: the unusually pungent smell of the car fumes, because fuel is in short supply and almost anything flammable is put into petrol tanks; the massive 'camel' buses pulled by ancient Soviet trucks; the muddle of skin tones, from pale European to dark African, making it the first place you've ever been where you simply forget about race altogether after a while. You mark the fact that there are no overweight people at all, and no homeless on the streets.</p> <p>Slightly later, in the almost comically chaotic radio studio, a DJ will ask Nicky Wire, Manic Street Preachers' lanky bass player-lyricist, why his band has come here.</p> <p>'Well, the first gig we did last time was in Kettering,' he deadpans. 'So this seemed as far from that as we could go.'</p> <p>Wire was being flippant, of course, and a little disingenuous. The idea of commemo rating tomorrow's release of a new Manics album by becoming the first major non-communist rock act to play Havana since 1979 came to them eight months ago and has cost a small fortune to realise.</p> <p>Back home, it has also re-opened the old debate about pop stars playing with politics. The argument for is that they have access to a large audience. The more compelling case against has in one way or another touched everything from George Harrison's Concert For Bangladesh to Rock Against Racism, Live Aid, Red Wedge and the current Jubilee 2000 campaign around Third World debt. Who gains most from such involvement in the long run - cause or artist? Is hitching a serious issue to the ephemeral and fashion-sensitive pop counter-productive and self-serving? These questions have never been more urgent than they are in our age of mandatory celebrity endorsement of all things. And on the face of it, what cause could be more natural for a rock group to endorse than the Cuban revolution?</p> <p>Most of the scepticism around Manic Street Preachers' decision to go to Havana has centred on the human-rights failings of the Castro regime. After a couple of days in the place, my concern about their presence here is different. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and consequent loss of its sponsorship, the government had little option but to open up to outsiders and now, if you listen, you begin to hear tales of a village to the south which has become a sex tourism destination for Canadian men. Meanwhile, amid the colonial splendour of the Nacional Hotel, where the Mafia held court in Batista's day, we watch two Englishmen acquire a prostitute for the duration of their stay and send her out to 'find her mate Charlie'.</p> <p>Cuba is changing and no one is quite sure where the changes are leading. Fidel is 75 this year and can't last forever. Many Cubans still express what appears to be genuine respect and affection for him, blaming the US embargo for their plight: those who don't usually refuse to speak. A typical conversation is one I have with a taxi driver who used to earn $15 a month as a mechanical engineer - the average is $20 - after I've asked what people think of Fidel these days.</p> <p>'Oh, some love him, some do not,' he edges. 'What about you?' I enquire and there is a long, long pause. 'I cannot answer you. Questions like that are.. dangerous. I don't know who you are. I could lose my job.'</p> <p>And this is a good job, he adds. The fact is that there are two economies now, one driven by near-worthless pesos and the other running on US dollars, and like the legions of prostitutes, he makes dollars. Do people lose their jobs for saying the wrong thing? He shrugs, clearly wanting the conversation to end. Amnesty International reports that people do lose their jobs for saying the wrong thing, that there are political prisoners in Cuban jails (whose offences can and do consist merely of criticising the annual report of the Communist Party - a couple were handed three years for this), while gay people languish in squalid correctional institutes as a direct result of their sexuality. Until someone works out a way to look into Castro's soul, no one can say how much of this is purely a defensive reaction to years of US hostility, but it's a fact. Nicky Wire has been firmly instructed not to wear a skirt onstage, as he often does at home.</p> <p>The one thing everyone agrees upon is that there is no obvious candidate to replace Castro and people start to hedge again around the question of what happens when he's gone. Now along come Manic Street Preachers, heavily subsidised by the multinational Sony corporation, perhaps paving the way for others.</p> <p>By showtime, things seem a little different. It's 7.30pm on a clear, warm Saturday night and I'm standing on the pavement, listening to the gentle hiss of surf mingling with the chatter of thousands of young Cubans who are pouring excitedly into the Karl Marx Theatre to see a band they know next to nothing about. British rock is popular here and seems to contribute to a charming but laughable impression that we represent some kind of feisty, independent-minded alternative to American cultural hegemony. No one has the faintest idea of what the audience will make of them.</p> <p>I'm out front, chatting to members of the audience, when word comes that Fidel is here, that he has been backstage for an impromptu summit with the band. No one can quite believe it. During the jovial exchange, the old man happens to mention that he has seen the lyrics to one of only two weak songs on the otherwise vivid Know Your Enemy - 'Baby Elian', about the Cuban boy who became the focus of a tussle between the US and Cuban governments last year - and that he finds them 'beautiful'. The problem is that the Manics hadn't intended to play the song ('We thought it would just be too much,' grins Wire), meaning that Bradfield has to bail them out with a solo acoustic version, at the end of which Castro rises in a flamboyant show of appreciation. What's all that about then? I find myself wondering.</p> <p>Chatting again with members of the audience afterwards, most seem to have been impressed, not least by the scale of the show. I do manage to find one girl who spits, 'No, I don't like this - I am a punk!' and another who says 'I prefer alternative music', both of which cause Wire to roar with laughter later.</p> <p>'I suspect that this concert will be talked about for years to come,' suggests Michael White, the British Council's country direc tor, at a reception he hosts afterwards. And despite myself, I have to acknowledge the pleasure ordinary Cubans appear to be taking in the mere fact that a well-known foreign band have made the effort to come here and lessen their sense of isolation.</p> <p>That said, cultural solidarity isn't the only talking point afterwards. Bumping into Nick Naysmith, the amiable keyboard player, I ask him what his impressions of Fidel were.</p> <p>'Well,' he offers, 'I can tell you one thing. He dresses to the left.'</p> <p>'Er, sorry?'</p> <p>'Yep. It was huge.'</p> <p>Everybody's talking about it and it's not long before word gets out that Fidel has two local nicknames, these being 'The Beard' and 'The Horse'. Unable to quite believe what I'm hearing, I consult the ever-down-to-earth Bradfield. 'It was halfway down his leg,' he twinkles. 'Now we know the source of his power, don't we?'</p> <p>For the first time, that old story about the CIA attempting to assassinate the father of the revolution by poisoning his underpants makes a kind of sense.</p> <p>The next morning, Wire wakes to a deep sense of anticlimax. He'd played a blinding show, met one of his heroes, Fidel Castro, then two more, the athlete Alberto Juanterino and Felix Savon, an impossibly statuesque ex-boxer whose samba skills had mesmerised us all. Wire had retired early to his room to phone his wife and tell her about his adventure, then crashed. Now he feels drained.</p> <p>Fidel has invited the Manics to be guests of honour at the opening of a new state university, la Escuela de Instructores de Arte Manuel Domenech, inland in Santa Clara. Right from the off, the atmosphere is strained, with the band becoming truculent as the day-long excursion wears on ('It was like a return to the old days of Communism,' Wire comments later. 'We were carted around, with no one giving us any information about what was happening'). Eventually, we arrive at the college, which is festooned with student artwork, a bizarre proportion of which deals with familiar images of Che. Wire and his colleagues are in a foul mood by this time, talking of going straight home and fucking Castro.</p> <p>We are herded into a small theatre and take up positions at the end of three narrow rows of seats, where we wait for a further 20 minutes or so. Then there is a bustle at the door and he is among us. In fact, he is at the end of my row and one of his aids is motioning urgently for me to come forward. Unfortunately, by the time I've understood the instruction, Fidel has already started towards me. We meet in the middle and both instantly realise that there is no possibility of circumnavigating each other. I look at him. He looks at me. He offers his hand and I respond tentatively, fearful that I might miss and accidentally shake his penis instead, thereby ensuring that I spend the rest of my days festering in a military dungeon. Eventually, there is nothing for it but to clamber over the seats in the most undignified way imaginable. My big moment, blown.</p> <p>He banters with the band, through an interpreter. Everyone is entertained: being all military bearing, mischievous grin and raised eyebrows, he is essentially Mel Brooks with a beard. Provided you're not gay, of course, at which point he becomes Adolf Hitler with a beard.</p> <p>Before yesterday's show, Wire had cautioned that 'It might be a bit loud tonight' and Castro had replied, brilliantly, 'Will it be as loud as war?' - despite the fact that he hasn't been to one for 42 years. Now Wire has the chance to ask if it had been as loud as war and the older man shoots back, with mock incredulity 'It was louder!', before ribbing drummer Sean Moore about his role as artillery. He is animated as he compares notes on song composition and speeches and wisecracks about relations between the Welsh, Scots and English. Then, as if on cue, he seems to turn towards the battery of media and raises the subject of Baby Elian.</p> <p>Instantly, it is as if we have stepped into one of those old-fashioned TV soap powder ads, where Bruce Forsyth or Leslie Crowther collars a housewife in a supermarket and hustles her into saying something nice about a product she's probably never seen before. She needed to be there, but it wasn't about her. As it isn't about the Manics now - or me, as a representative of the foreign media. We are being monstered, used to help facilitate a bit of nationalist fervour.</p> <p>I find myself laughing. You don't get to be in power for forty years without knowing how to turn on the charm, or without recognising a useful photo opportunity when you see one. The long journey back is spent happily compiling top 10s with Bradfield. If you're going to be monstered, you might as well be monstered by the best.</p> <p>By the next day, Wire's version of events has undergone a revisionist rewrite. He had merely been exhausted, rather than pissed off, during the pre-Fidel part of the trip. The adrenalin rush of Saturday night had been 'so gigantic' that there was bound to be a reaction. 'Everybody could have just burst out crying,' he says. He doesn't mind having been used for propaganda purposes.</p> <p>'Oh, I thought that would happen anyway. I'm not naive enough to believe that they wouldn't use us to promote something for them. And let's face it, we're using them just as much. To think of it in terms of being used and abused.. it might have felt like that for a couple of minutes, but it just wasn't.</p> <p>So you're sold, then? 'Well..' There is a deep sigh. 'I think it's different to anywhere else I've ever been. It has a different spirit. And, for all the things we might disapprove of, Castro stands out as someone who's really tried to do something good.</p> <p>'The literacy rate here is higher than in the UK and the health service works. There are no homeless people. They have kind of jumped on Baby Elian, but I don't think that was pre-planned. And to be honest, I wouldn't have wrote the song if I didn't feel strongly about it myself.'</p> <p>Wire's good at being a pop star and seems to be enjoying it again. On the last album, he suggests, they were all pretty happy in their outside lives and some of the desire had gone. Now, he feels less contended and has more that he wants to say.</p> <p>He aims gleeful tirades at a range of subjects including the cult of celebrity, the supineness of the media, John Lennon's 'Imagine' ('Sexy Sadie', he rightly points out, is much truer to the man's spirit) and is happy as a sandboy until we get on to the subject of Richey Edward - the troubled guitarist/lyricist who played Che to his Castro but disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 1995. Manic Street Preachers have now made as many albums without him as with him. It seems like an important watershed, but Wire admits that they still haven't grieved for the colleague who had been his best mate since the age of 10, though his feelings are changing with time.</p> <p>'I think that's true and that's the frightening thing and that's why I try not to dwell on it too much. You do read about what delayed grief can do to people when it settles on you. But, however bad you feel about that last year, I'm still romantic enough to think that those pictures of Richey in Thailand with blood all over his chest are fucking beautiful and magnificent - I mean, it's better than looking at Brian Moloko [singer in gothy angst-merchants Placebo] or any of those other dead-weight, useless imposters... I still can't think of him as being dead, though. None of us knows.'</p> <p>And after a while. you start to suspect that Nicky Wire sees Fidel Castro and the Cuban revolution in a similar way.</p>",

I began disagreeing vociferously with the Academicians when they gave only a minor prize to Ford's Cavalry Trilogy in the Forties and I started to get angry in 1958 when Paths of Glory was ignored in favour of Bridge on the River Kwai . Still, these lists are my bests (or in one case worsts) of their bests. Feel free to provide an alternative list. </p> <p><strong>Best Film</strong> </p> <p><strong>1. Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1943)</strong> <br>The work of a fine team behind the camera and a perfectly cast ensemble in front of it, this great collaborative product of the Hollywood system perfectly caught the mood of the war years in a story of love, duty and sacrifice. It gets better as time goes by and has helped in bridging the gap, or blurring the distinction, between art and popular culture. </p> <p> <strong> 2. On the Waterfront (Elia Kazan, 1954)</strong><br>The Method style of acting and the documentary style of filming are united with unparalleled force. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Lawrence of Arabia (David Lean, 1962)</strong><br>A film that brings together an epic visual sweep with an intimate view of individual psychology. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood, 1992)</strong><br> A complex moral western that challenges and renews the cinema's greatest genre. </p> <p> <strong> Worst Film</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Titanic (James Cameron, 1997)</strong><br>Astonishingly, hardly any truly terrible pictures have won Oscars, though a famously acerbic British director recently opined in my presence that the two worst pictures he's seen in the past decade were American Beauty and The English Patient, and compared the latter to a maple-syrup enema. But in my view, Titanic is awful in every way, from its banal dialogue and bad acting to its forced romanticism and strident Oscar-winning song. </p> <p> <strong> 2. The Greatest Show on Earth (Cecil B. De Mille, 1952)</strong><br>De Mille was one of the great silent directors, but his sound films, peaking with this empty offering of stale bread and circuses, were over-inflated. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Rocky (John G. Avildsen, 1976)</strong><br> Impossible to separate the aspirations of character actor Stallone and dim-witted boxer Balboa in this sentimental paean to the American Dream. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Terms of Endearment (James L. Brooks, 1983)</strong><br>Dreadful comedy covering 30 years; soap opera as the ultimate detergent. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Forrest Gump (Robert Zemeckis, 1994)</strong><br> A non-satirical Candide and a feelgood Huckleberry Finn served up as pap history for Middle America. </p> <p> <strong> Best Director</strong></p> <p><strong>1. John Ford - The Grapes of Wrath (1940)</strong><br>Hitchcock, Lubitsch, Lang, Hawks and Welles never received a best director Oscar. But Ford got four, for The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green Was My Valley (1941) and The Quiet Man (1952), though never for a western. </p> <p>America's greatest literary critic, Edmund Wilson, observed that The Grapes of Wrath is 'the sole serious story on record that seems equally effective as a book and as a film'. Welles once said: 'I learnt from the old masters - by which I mean John Ford, John Ford and John Ford' and said that he didn't mind Citizen Kane losing to How Green Was My Valley. </p> <p> <strong> 2. William Wyler - The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)</strong><br>A meticulously handled examination of a nation turning its hand from swords to ploughshares. </p> <p> <strong> 3. John Huston - The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)</strong><br> A great director pursues his constant theme of doomed questers in pursuit of an elusive, perhaps unattainable, grail. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Joseph L. Mankiewicz - All About Eve (1950)</strong><br>The New York theatre as a metaphor for life itself in a scintillatingly witty, dazzlingly performed picture by a writer who turned director to protect his scripts </p> <p> <strong> 5. Francis Ford Coppola - The Godfather Part II (1974)</strong><br> Arguably the greatest sequel since the New Testament or Henry IV Part II , it demonstrated the reckless ambition of Hollywood's new auteurs. </p> <p> <strong> Best Actress</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Vivien Leigh - Gone With the Wind (1939); A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)</strong><br> Leigh's two vulnerable Southern belles, one a resilient antebellum survivor, the other a crushed postbellum victim, constitute a diptych and must now be taken together. She got Oscars for her best movie roles, unlike Katharine Hepburn, who won four Oscars, three for mediocre, largely forgotten films, but wasn't honoured for her finest work (eg Bringing Up Baby, Philadelphia Story, African Queen). </p> <p> <strong> 2. Joan Crawford - Mildred Pierce (1945)</strong><br> A great actress at her sado-masochistic best in a noir melodrama worthy of her talents. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Audrey Hepburn - Roman Holiday (1953)</strong><br> In her first starring role as a fugitive princess, Hepburn melted many a republican heart as she revealed her swanlike grace, puckish wit and emotional generosity. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Simone Signoret - Room at the Top (1958)</strong><br>Strong emotions and confident sexuality were not considered proper for Englishwomen at the time, so Signoret crossed the Channel to give this incandescent performance as a neglectful Yorkshireman's adulterous wife. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Holly Hunter - The Piano (1993)</strong><br>The Nineties Oscars went to actresses playing assured women and actors playing demoralised men, and Holly Hunter's performance as the mute immigrant in nineteenth-century New Zealand was arguably the best. </p> <p> <strong> Best Actor</strong></p> <p><strong>1. George C. Scott - Patton (1970)</strong><br>As with actresses, few top actors won Oscars with their best work. Two-time winner Spencer Tracy was ignored for his great string of pictures with Katharine Hepburn and for Bad Day At Black Rock; James Stewart wasn't honoured for his westerns or his Hitchcock pictures; Paul Newman, unrewarded for The Hustler (1961), had to wait until its inferior sequel, The Color of Money (1986), to receive his dues. But Scott's towering portrayal of the most controversial general of the Second World War is his greatest performance, a complex portrait that is the cinematic equivalent of a Rembrandt painting. Like the maverick he was, Scott refused to accept the Oscar. </p> <p> <strong> 2. James Cagney - Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942)</strong><br>The actor who best embodied the vitality of big-city life finds a perfect role as the brash Irish-American composer and dancer George M. Cohan, laureate of the American Dream. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Gary Cooper - High Noon (1952)</strong><br>Cooper brought his powerful probity to the role he was born to play, the decent, inner-directed sheriff standing alone against ruthless outlaws in a liberal western reflecting the cowardice of Hollywood in the McCarthy Era. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Marlon Brando - On the Waterfront (1954)</strong><br> Brando's shambling, failed pugilist in search of redemption is the Everest of an up-and-down career, and there are scenes in this film where he comes close to breaking your heart. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Robert De Niro - Raging Bull (1980)</strong><br>De Niro is the greatest screen actor of his generation, and his impersonation of the brutal prizefighter Jake La Motta is a physical and dramatic tour de force that nods towards Brando's Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront .</p>",

So what can you do to cut your bill? </p> <p><strong>Use up your Isa allowance </strong></p> <p>If all taxpayers made use of their annual Isa allowance of \u00a37,000, they could save more than \u00a3550m in total by sheltering investments in an Isa or moving savings (up to a maximum of \u00a33,000) from an ordinary deposit or savings account. </p> <p><strong>Free your capital gains </strong></p> <p>If you plan to sell shares, unit trusts or other assets which attract capital gains tax, and you anticipate making gains of more than \u00a37,200, act before the end of the tax year to make the most of your annual capital gains tax exemption.

But, unlike the shares and loan notes that were also available, the cash would immediately attract CGT. However, following advice from Martin Eckersall of Edinburgh-based tax advisers Scott Oswald, Brown decided to invest cash in a venture capital trust (VCT) and an enterprise investment scheme (EIS).</p> <p>There are a number of tax benefits linked to VCTs. First, investors can shelter any capital gains that may otherwise be subject to tax, which defers 40 per cent tax. Second, investors receive a 20 per cent income tax rebate on the sum invested.</p> <p>The next benefit is that the VCT pays no tax on any growth in the underlying investments, and any dividends paid to the investors are tax-free. </p> <p>Finally, any gains made on selling the VCT are tax-exempt. </p> <p>The maximum investment that an individual can make into a VCT is \u00a3100,000 each tax year. However, to qualify for the tax breaks, a VCT must invest a large proportion of its capital in young and developing companies - a very high-risk strategy.</p> <p>David says: 'The scheme was also a way for me to diversify my investment holdings. I am interested in investing in young companies where I realise I am taking a few risks.' David used some of his retirement cash to help set up an internet company, buyersview.co.uk, which is an independent online service that rates shops on the internet. This has been structured as an EIS. An EIS attracts similar tax breaks to those enjoyed by VCT.</p> <p>The maximum investment into an EIS is \u00a3150,000 a year. This type of scheme is even more risky than a VCT, because all the capital is invested in just one company.</p> <p>David says: 'The tax breaks available to the EIS will be very useful. We will be able to attract money in the future if we need it, with investors able to obtain tax relief and deferment.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "When David Brown, 59, took early retirement from Robert Fleming, following the takeover by Chase Manhattan, he wanted to defer the capital gains tax (CGT) that would be payable on part of his retirement pay. David took some cash from the takeover to invest for capital growth. But, unlike the shares and loan notes that were also available, the cash would immediately attract CGT. However, following advice from Martin Eckersall of Edinburgh-based tax advisers Scott Oswald, Brown decided to invest cash in a venture capital trust (VCT) and an enterprise investment scheme (EIS). There are a number of tax benefits linked to VCTs. First, investors can shelter any capital gains that may otherwise be subject to tax, which defers 40 per cent tax. Second, investors receive a 20 per cent income tax rebate on the sum invested. The next benefit is that the VCT pays no tax on any growth in the underlying investments, and any dividends paid to the investors are tax-free. Finally, any gains made on selling the VCT are tax-exempt. The maximum investment that an individual can make into a VCT is \u00a3100,000 each tax year. However, to qualify for the tax breaks, a VCT must invest a large proportion of its capital in young and developing companies - a very high-risk strategy. David says: 'The scheme was also a way for me to diversify my investment holdings. I am interested in investing in young companies where I realise I am taking a few risks.' David used some of his retirement cash to help set up an internet company, buyersview.co.uk, which is an independent online service that rates shops on the internet. This has been structured as an EIS. An EIS attracts similar tax breaks to those enjoyed by VCT. The maximum investment into an EIS is \u00a3150,000 a year. This type of scheme is even more risky than a VCT, because all the capital is invested in just one company. David says: 'The tax breaks available to the EIS will be very useful. We will be able to attract money in the future if we need it, with investors able to obtain tax relief and deferment.'",

      "body": "<p>Unless you are a long-term fan of Coronation Street, you will have missed a vital lesson about pensions and why you should not leave the planning entirely to your other half. </p> <p>Audrey Roberts learned the hard way. When widowed by husband Alf - a man considered to be careful with his cash - Audrey assumed that she would be left well-provided for. However, not only had Alf failed to renew his life insurance but also, when he died, his pension died with him. Why? Because instead of buying a joint life annuity, which would have carried on paying Audrey a pension until her death, he had used the proceeds of his personal pension to buy a single life annuity. </p> <p>So could such a thing happen in real life? It's unlikely that the widow of someone who had been receiving an employer's pension would be left penniless - but she could still face a sharp drop in income. Although the tax rules allow for a widow(er)'s pension of two-thirds of the pension paid before death, according to a survey by the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), the majority of schemes pay half the original pension while a handful pay less than one third. </p> <p>The situation for unmarried couples is less clear-cut. While NAPF found that 5 per cent of private-sector schemes would pay the equivalent of a widow(er)'s pension 'as a matter of course', half said that it would be 'at the trustees' discretion' while 12 per cent replied 'not in any circumstances' - an answer given by just under 60 per cent of schemes in the public sector. </p> <p>Married or not, whether a surviving partner gets anything from a personal pension (which includes the imminent stakeholder pensions) is largely at the discretion of the person buying the annuity. The rules for contracting out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps) say that the part of the pension fund made up of rebated national insurance must be used to provide a widow(er)'s pension. There are no such restrictions on the kind of annuity that has to be bought with the fund built up from other contributions. And buying a joint annuity means less to live on. </p> <p>A man retiring at 65 today with a pension pot of \u00a3100,000 could buy himself a pension which stopped on his death of just under \u00a39,100 a year, according to annuity specialists The Annuity Bureau (020 7902 2300). The same lump sum would buy a couple a yearly income of \u00a37,985 up to the man's death, followed by a pension for his widow of half that amount - although if the woman died first, the man would carry on getting a pension of \u00a37,985. That assumes that both partners are the same age. If the wife was five years younger than her husband, the couple's initial pension would be \u00a37,755. With a ten-year age gap, it would fall to \u00a37,535. Given the choice between a lower pension and leaving a spouse in the financial lurch, Peter Quinton of The Annuity Bureau believes that most men opt for the lower pension. </p> <p>All this assumes that it's the man's job to provide the pension. Margaret Craig, pensions development manager at Scottish Equitable, doesn't think it should be and says that the only way a woman can be certain of having a decent income in retirement is to make her own pension provision. She says: 'Now that the vast majority of women are economically independent, why on Earth would anyone want to give that up in retirement?' But having two pensions rather than one also makes sense from a purely financial point of view. </p> <p>For example, if a couple each built up a fund of \u00a350,000 and at age 65 each bought an annuity, the man could have a yearly income of \u00a34,000 and the woman an income of \u00a33,850, which gives a joint income of \u00a37,850. Before tax, this is slightly less than the \u00a37,985 they would have got if the man alone bought an annuity with a single fund of \u00a3100,000. After tax, it's a different story. If only the man builds up a fund and buys an annuity, all the income from it is taxed as his and - assuming he also got the full state pension of \u00a33,510 - would mean a tax bill of just over \u00a31,000. But buying separate annuities brings the couple's tax bill to \u00a3500 because they can each make full use of the higher age-related personal allowance of \u00a35,790 (due to increase to \u00a35,990 in the 2001-02 tax year). </p> <p>Provided both partners buy joint annuities - or both have an employer's pension - having two pensions has particular advantages for the woman after the death of her partner. Although she may get only half of her dead partner's pension, her own pension would be unaffected. This results in a reduction in income of 25 per cent rather than the 50 per cent drop she would face if she had relied wholly on her partner. </p> <p>There is a moderate disadvantage to sharing pension provision for a man which wouldn't happen if he were wholly responsible for buying the couple's pension income. If the woman dies first the man would also see a reduction in pension income of 25 per cent because he would get half his partner's income after her death. But since this puts both partners on a more equal financial footing and since a single person needs less to live on than a couple, it's a price worth paying.</p>",

For example, if a couple each built up a fund of \u00a350,000 and at age 65 each bought an annuity, the man could have a yearly income of \u00a34,000 and the woman an income of \u00a33,850, which gives a joint income of \u00a37,850. Before tax, this is slightly less than the \u00a37,985 they would have got if the man alone bought an annuity with a single fund of \u00a3100,000. After tax, it's a different story. If only the man builds up a fund and buys an annuity, all the income from it is taxed as his and - assuming he also got the full state pension of \u00a33,510 - would mean a tax bill of just over \u00a31,000. But buying separate annuities brings the couple's tax bill to \u00a3500 because they can each make full use of the higher age-related personal allowance of \u00a35,790 (due to increase to \u00a35,990 in the 2001-02 tax year). Provided both partners buy joint annuities - or both have an employer's pension - having two pensions has particular advantages for the woman after the death of her partner. Although she may get only half of her dead partner's pension, her own pension would be unaffected. This results in a reduction in income of 25 per cent rather than the 50 per cent drop she would face if she had relied wholly on her partner. There is a moderate disadvantage to sharing pension provision for a man which wouldn't happen if he were wholly responsible for buying the couple's pension income. If the woman dies first the man would also see a reduction in pension income of 25 per cent because he would get half his partner's income after her death. But since this puts both partners on a more equal financial footing and since a single person needs less to live on than a couple, it's a price worth paying.",

It will have around 80,000 employees, upwards of 2 million customers and more than 1,000 offices around the country. It will have a budget of something like \u00a31 billion in its first 12 months; and if you're out of work at any time in the next few years, you will probably be hoping some of that money will come in your direction. </p> <p>The organisation in question is the Working Age Agency - a working title - which is shortly to be created by a merger between the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service. </p> <p>Announced a year ago last Friday by Tony Blair, it is intended to provide a one-stop shop for anybody of working age looking for work or receiving benefits and will eventually replace both JobCentres and benefits offices. </p> <p>It will be the biggest government agency by far - dwarfing even the Inland Revenue - and its mission statement will be one of New Labour's mantras: 'Work for those who can, security for those who can't.' </p> <p>But having grabbed the headlines last March, the new agency has been slow off the ground. A chief executive was chosen only in January, and the staff of the Benefits Agency and Employment Service still have little idea of how they will fit in. The agency is expected to be formed legally in June, with 'pathfinder' locations up and running by October. </p> <p>Despite unemployment falling to a 25-year low at fewer than 1 million, the new agency will have plenty to do. Last week Chancellor Gordon Brown announced a second stage in the 'New Deal' programme that will concentrate on coaching and counselling for the unemployed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there is growing concern about whether the 'personal advisers' who will deal with the agency's disparate clients will be able to act as experts on the benefits system one moment and provide advice on job-seeking the next. </p> <p>There is particular concern about the Budget announcement that lone parents of children under five would be required to attend 'work-focused interviews' to discuss their future careers. They will not be forced to look for work - but Kate Green of the National Council for One-Parent Families says: 'Parents may feel under pressure to get into work.' </p> <p>The idea that every person will have a 'personal adviser' has been born out of Labour's New Deal programmes, and is intended to ensure that people out of work do not have to chase from pillar to post, but have a single contact who can handle all their needs. </p> <p>Nick Burkitt, research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, the centre-left think-tank, says personal advisers might find themselves having to 'find a job for someone who hasn't worked in 10 years; understand a benefit system with a rulebook the size of a phone directory; be sensitive to the needs of local businesses; and be able to defend themselves against a client with a skinful of Special Brew.' </p> <p>It sounds like an impossible brief, and it probably is. At the least, it will require a huge training exercise; benefits officers will learn how to advise on jobs and training schemes while their JobCentre counterparts learn the ins and outs of incapacity benefit. </p> <p>Burkitt believes the agency will have to consider allowing staff to specialise in particular client groups; and staff will have to know when to ask for help. 'They won't know everything,' he points out. </p> <p>The PCS union, which represents many of those who work in the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service, is concerned about the safety of employees. 'Staff in benefits offices work behind security screens, while those in JobCentres don't,' says Keith Wylie, the union's national officer. </p> <p>The union is also worried about redundancies, given that the new agency will end much of the duplicated administration currently involved in paying benefits and providing advice to the same people. </p> <p>Paul Convery, director of the independent policy research group Unemployment Unit and Youthaid, says the merger will mean a huge cultural shift for those working in benefits offices. 'Ten years ago the Employment Service managed to get rid of their screens and move to an open-plan, user-friendly environment, and although there were some difficulties they managed it,' he says. 'Now the Benefits Agency people will have to go through the same thing.' He believes that claimants are far less likely to become violent if they are not kept at bay behind security screens. </p> <p>Like most corporate marriages, this is unlikely to prove a merger of equals. </p> <p>Convery says: 'The Government's agenda in setting up this new agency is very much about bringing a work focus to people the benefits system has actively taken away from the labour market.' </p> <p>One key role of the new agency will be to take a more pro-active stance in finding work for everyone capable of doing it, rather than leaving them to languish indefinitely on benefits. </p> <p>But it will be impossible to provide a personal adviser on Day One for every one of the million-odd people claiming jobseekers allowance, the 2.9 million claiming sickness and disability benefits, and the 900,000 single parents claiming benefits. </p> <p>The emphasis to begin with is likely to be on new claimants as well as those who express the desire to find work. </p> <p>But the thorny issue of compulsion is sure to rear its head. So far, only unemployed claimants in the 18-24 age group have been compelled to take either a job or a training course, but other groups may soon have to take a more active part in looking for work - or risk losing their benefit. </p> <p>The name under which the new agency will actually be launched remains a secret - if it has been chosen. If Working Age Agency is deemed too boring, the Government could always take a leaf out of the Post Office's book and call in the identity consultants. Any new name would presumably need to say something about the virtues of hard work. How about Exertia?</p>",

Despite unemployment falling to a 25-year low at fewer than 1 million, the new agency will have plenty to do. Last week Chancellor Gordon Brown announced a second stage in the 'New Deal' programme that will concentrate on coaching and counselling for the unemployed. Meanwhile, there is growing concern about whether the 'personal advisers' who will deal with the agency's disparate clients will be able to act as experts on the benefits system one moment and provide advice on job-seeking the next. There is particular concern about the Budget announcement that lone parents of children under five would be required to attend 'work-focused interviews' to discuss their future careers. They will not be forced to look for work - but Kate Green of the National Council for One-Parent Families says: 'Parents may feel under pressure to get into work.' The idea that every person will have a 'personal adviser' has been born out of Labour's New Deal programmes, and is intended to ensure that people out of work do not have to chase from pillar to post, but have a single contact who can handle all their needs. Nick Burkitt, research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, the centre-left think-tank, says personal advisers might find themselves having to 'find a job for someone who hasn't worked in 10 years; understand a benefit system with a rulebook the size of a phone directory; be sensitive to the needs of local businesses; and be able to defend themselves against a client with a skinful of Special Brew.' It sounds like an impossible brief, and it probably is. At the least, it will require a huge training exercise; benefits officers will learn how to advise on jobs and training schemes while their JobCentre counterparts learn the ins and outs of incapacity benefit. Burkitt believes the agency will have to consider allowing staff to specialise in particular client groups; and staff will have to know when to ask for help. 'They won't know everything,' he points out. The PCS union, which represents many of those who work in the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service, is concerned about the safety of employees. 'Staff in benefits offices work behind security screens, while those in JobCentres don't,' says Keith Wylie, the union's national officer. The union is also worried about redundancies, given that the new agency will end much of the duplicated administration currently involved in paying benefits and providing advice to the same people. Paul Convery, director of the independent policy research group Unemployment Unit and Youthaid, says the merger will mean a huge cultural shift for those working in benefits offices. 'Ten years ago the Employment Service managed to get rid of their screens and move to an open-plan, user-friendly environment, and although there were some difficulties they managed it,' he says. 'Now the Benefits Agency people will have to go through the same thing.' He believes that claimants are far less likely to become violent if they are not kept at bay behind security screens. Like most corporate marriages, this is unlikely to prove a merger of equals. Convery says: 'The Government's agenda in setting up this new agency is very much about bringing a work focus to people the benefits system has actively taken away from the labour market.' One key role of the new agency will be to take a more pro-active stance in finding work for everyone capable of doing it, rather than leaving them to languish indefinitely on benefits. But it will be impossible to provide a personal adviser on Day One for every one of the million-odd people claiming jobseekers allowance, the 2.9 million claiming sickness and disability benefits, and the 900,000 single parents claiming benefits. The emphasis to begin with is likely to be on new claimants as well as those who express the desire to find work. But the thorny issue of compulsion is sure to rear its head. So far, only unemployed claimants in the 18-24 age group have been compelled to take either a job or a training course, but other groups may soon have to take a more active part in looking for work - or risk losing their benefit. The name under which the new agency will actually be launched remains a secret - if it has been chosen. If Working Age Agency is deemed too boring, the Government could always take a leaf out of the Post Office's book and call in the identity consultants. Any new name would presumably need to say something about the virtues of hard work. How about Exertia?",

      "body": "<p>These days, when the stock market sneezes, most of us catch at least a sniffle, if not a fullblown dose of 'flu. </p> <p>There are 12 million small shareholders in the UK now, more than double the number 15 years ago. Even more people have indirect stakes in the market through their pension funds, endowment policies, Isa investment plans and 'pooled' funds such as unit trusts. Sixteen per cent of quoted UK shares are in the hands of private investors, while 20 per cent are held by pension funds, 3 per cent by unit trusts, 2 per cent by investment trusts, and 5.5 per cent by other financial institutions including life insurance funds. </p> <p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that the investing public, including those who invest directly in shares - and feel the pain of falling prices first - are less prone to panic in falling markets than before the 1987 market crash. But tum bling prices are unnerving, even for indirect investors. </p> <p>For those with beleaguered life insurer Equitable Life, market mayhem has brought more pain, in the form of increased exit charges, up from 10 to 15 per cent. Advisers were still assessing the implications of this announcement at the end of last week although immediate reaction was that it would make a switch out of Equitable too expensive for many now to contemplate. </p> <p>Market experts expect share prices will recover, although they are nervous about how long the slump will continue. </p> <p>For most shareholders, direct and indirect, the best advice is sit tight. Many people will hold money in investments that they cannot move out of. Others face dilemmas about whether to commit more money to the market, or to hold their funds in cash. </p> <p>Here we look at the effect on different investments - and what action investors should take.</p> <p><strong>Isas </strong></p> <p>Investors who haven't used their Isa allowance yet are faced with a daunting choice. The deadline for using the 2000/2001 allowance is 5 April - any unused allowance is lost after this date. But if you invest now to maximise your tax savings, you could end up with heavy losses. </p> <p>Justin Modray of Bath independent financial adviser Fundsdirect advises anyone with moderate amounts to invest to hold on to their money until the stock market settles and maximise use of next year's \u00a37,000 Isa allowance instead. He says: 'It's great having tax-efficient investments, but losses aren't so attractive.' Alternatively he suggests investing in a less volatile corporate bond fund for the time being, possibly switching when the equities market becomes more attractive.</p> <p>Jason Hollands of London firm Best Invest disagrees: 'At these levels, when there's doom and gloom all around, you should be investing, taking advantage of the low prices and the tax savings.'</p> <p>Investors who want the best of both worlds - to use their allowance and defer investment in the market - can use a 'drip feed' scheme such as that available through Fidelity's online supermarket <a href=\"http://www.fundsnetwork.co.uk\">FundsNetwork</a>.</p> <p>This allows you to invest a lump sum now, which is then phased into your choice of funds in six equal portions over six months. However, the first tranche is invested immediately, and there's no guarantee that the market will have improved in one month or even six months.</p> <p><strong>Endowments/With-profit bonds</strong></p> <p>Homeowners and savers with money in with-profits endowments will be cushioned from the full pain of market losses. </p> <p>Insurance companies aim to smooth returns on with-profits investments by the allocation of bonuses. Money can be withheld in good years to add in poorer years.</p> <p>But endowment investors are not immune to market falls and insurance companies have been reducing bonuses in anticipation of falling returns.</p> <p>David Carrington of Policyplus, a company specialising in secondhand endowments, says policyholders should not try to get out unless they need the cash. If they do, they should look to sell in the secondhand market rather than surrendering to the insurer. He also points out that investors have limited choice over where to obtain positive returns; it is possible to buy as well as sell in the secondhand market.</p> <p>'In the past, such volatile stock market conditions would come at a time when interest rates were rising, so cash returns would be that bit better. What we have at the moment is interest rates falling and no prospect of a decent cash return in the next few years.'</p> <p>Companies running with-profit bonds - lump sum investments - may apply special exit penalties, known as market value adjusters, as a result of falling share prices. These don't affect returns on bonds - though falling bonuses will - but would hit investors cashing in. </p> <p><strong>Pensions </strong></p> <p>Members of 'final salary' pension schemes, where pensions are determined by salary at retirement and length of service, may not be affected by market falls. </p> <p>Employers would have to make good any shortfall but there could be consequences from a prolonged period of market losses</p> <p>Employers have already begun to shy away from final salary schemes replacing them - for new employees - with 'money purchase' plans where employees bear the risk of markets plunging; a pension depends on the value of the investor's stake in the pension fund.</p> <p>John Turton, pensions specialist at independent adviser Best Investment, says a sustained period of losses could be the death knell for final salary schemes.</p> <p>People with money purchase company schemes, or personal pensions - which also invest directly in the stock market - are likely to see the effects of falling mar kets in their next valuation statements.</p> <p>Patrick Connolly of Chartwell Investment Management says: 'For most people this isn't a problem. There will be plenty of time for the market to recover. The only problem is where you are coming up to retirement and haven't planned in advance.'</p> <p>You should check the arrangements with your pension for protecting funds before retirement. These vary and although many company schemes and personal pensions offer auto matic switching facilities - from shares to bonds- through 'lifestyle' schemes, Mark Green at actuary Watson Wyatt says that these are not universal. Even where they exist, people taking early retirement can be caught out.</p> <p>Advisers say those near retirement who have not moved their money may have to postpone retirement or accept a smaller fund.</p> <p>Investors who have their money in with profit funds, should be insulated from market gyrations although Mark Green thinks pension savers should also review these close to retirement, though it is important to check any possible loss of maturity bonus if switching.</p> <p>Equitable Life provided a reminder last week that with profit funds are not immune from market mayhem, increasing exit penalties from 10 to 15 per cent.</p> <p>For those with longer to go to retirement, it is impossible to withdraw pension funds as cash, so the temptation to cut and run is not one they can pursue. Some, most likely those with personal pensions, may wonder whether to switch funds.</p> <p>Turton warns: 'Never sell out when markets have crashed.'</p> <p>A troubled stock market could cast gloom over the launch of stakeholder pensions next month. Turton says investors worried about committing money can save in a cash mini Isa or corporate bond Isa until the picture is clearer. Investors may have a wider choice of stakeholder plans to choose from later in the year. </p> <p><strong>Shares</strong></p> <p>There is one golden rule for investors as stock markets fall: Don't panic. </p> <p>'If you own shares, stick with them,' says Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. 'Selling now would only crystallise losses.'</p> <p>The markets have always recovered, given enough time, says Urquhart Stewart. He predicts that although there may be a few 'bear' rallies soon, the real recovery will start when the US economy starts showing signs of improving health, probably in the autumn.</p> <p>Jeremy King, director of private share ownership at the Proshare campaign, says many small investors have already absorbed a lot of shock, through the falls in technology stocks last year: 'While people are not happy to see the value of the market dip, there is more resignation than panic.'</p> <p>Ideally you should invest in the stock market only money that you can afford to forget about, so you can sell up when it suits you rather than because you are forced to by low prices.</p> <p>However if you do have to sell now, Proshare, which promotes share ownership, points out that if you invested your money more than a couple of years ago, your investment has probably increased in value by more than if you had left the money in a building society.</p> <p>Some investors may be tempted to take advantage of last week's falls to buy some cheap shares, but Urquhart Stewart advises them to keep their money on deposit for now: 'There are some very, very good value stocks out there but I'm not sure I'd buy them yet. I'd wait a few weeks.'</p> <p>You should also consider adopting a 'stop loss' policy in future to preserve the value of your portfolio. This involves setting a price of, for example, 20 per cent less than the amount you paid for a share. If your share falls to that point - the stop loss - you sell. Then if you still like the company, buy the share again as the price bottoms out. The stop loss should be readjusted if the share moves up in value.</p> <p><strong>What will happen to my income?</strong></p> <p>Income investors should come through the stock market volatility relatively unscathed.

      "bodyText": "These days, when the stock market sneezes, most of us catch at least a sniffle, if not a fullblown dose of 'flu. There are 12 million small shareholders in the UK now, more than double the number 15 years ago. Even more people have indirect stakes in the market through their pension funds, endowment policies, Isa investment plans and 'pooled' funds such as unit trusts. Sixteen per cent of quoted UK shares are in the hands of private investors, while 20 per cent are held by pension funds, 3 per cent by unit trusts, 2 per cent by investment trusts, and 5.5 per cent by other financial institutions including life insurance funds. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the investing public, including those who invest directly in shares - and feel the pain of falling prices first - are less prone to panic in falling markets than before the 1987 market crash. But tum bling prices are unnerving, even for indirect investors. For those with beleaguered life insurer Equitable Life, market mayhem has brought more pain, in the form of increased exit charges, up from 10 to 15 per cent. Advisers were still assessing the implications of this announcement at the end of last week although immediate reaction was that it would make a switch out of Equitable too expensive for many now to contemplate. Market experts expect share prices will recover, although they are nervous about how long the slump will continue. For most shareholders, direct and indirect, the best advice is sit tight. Many people will hold money in investments that they cannot move out of. Others face dilemmas about whether to commit more money to the market, or to hold their funds in cash. Here we look at the effect on different investments - and what action investors should take. Isas Investors who haven't used their Isa allowance yet are faced with a daunting choice. The deadline for using the 2000/2001 allowance is 5 April - any unused allowance is lost after this date. But if you invest now to maximise your tax savings, you could end up with heavy losses. Justin Modray of Bath independent financial adviser Fundsdirect advises anyone with moderate amounts to invest to hold on to their money until the stock market settles and maximise use of next year's \u00a37,000 Isa allowance instead. He says: 'It's great having tax-efficient investments, but losses aren't so attractive.' Alternatively he suggests investing in a less volatile corporate bond fund for the time being, possibly switching when the equities market becomes more attractive. Jason Hollands of London firm Best Invest disagrees: 'At these levels, when there's doom and gloom all around, you should be investing, taking advantage of the low prices and the tax savings.' Investors who want the best of both worlds - to use their allowance and defer investment in the market - can use a 'drip feed' scheme such as that available through Fidelity's online supermarket FundsNetwork. This allows you to invest a lump sum now, which is then phased into your choice of funds in six equal portions over six months. However, the first tranche is invested immediately, and there's no guarantee that the market will have improved in one month or even six months. Endowments/With-profit bonds Homeowners and savers with money in with-profits endowments will be cushioned from the full pain of market losses. Insurance companies aim to smooth returns on with-profits investments by the allocation of bonuses. Money can be withheld in good years to add in poorer years. But endowment investors are not immune to market falls and insurance companies have been reducing bonuses in anticipation of falling returns. David Carrington of Policyplus, a company specialising in secondhand endowments, says policyholders should not try to get out unless they need the cash. If they do, they should look to sell in the secondhand market rather than surrendering to the insurer. He also points out that investors have limited choice over where to obtain positive returns; it is possible to buy as well as sell in the secondhand market. 'In the past, such volatile stock market conditions would come at a time when interest rates were rising, so cash returns would be that bit better. What we have at the moment is interest rates falling and no prospect of a decent cash return in the next few years.' Companies running with-profit bonds - lump sum investments - may apply special exit penalties, known as market value adjusters, as a result of falling share prices. These don't affect returns on bonds - though falling bonuses will - but would hit investors cashing in. Pensions Members of 'final salary' pension schemes, where pensions are determined by salary at retirement and length of service, may not be affected by market falls. Employers would have to make good any shortfall but there could be consequences from a prolonged period of market losses Employers have already begun to shy away from final salary schemes replacing them - for new employees - with 'money purchase' plans where employees bear the risk of markets plunging; a pension depends on the value of the investor's stake in the pension fund. John Turton, pensions specialist at independent adviser Best Investment, says a sustained period of losses could be the death knell for final salary schemes. People with money purchase company schemes, or personal pensions - which also invest directly in the stock market - are likely to see the effects of falling mar kets in their next valuation statements. Patrick Connolly of Chartwell Investment Management says: 'For most people this isn't a problem. There will be plenty of time for the market to recover. The only problem is where you are coming up to retirement and haven't planned in advance.' You should check the arrangements with your pension for protecting funds before retirement. These vary and although many company schemes and personal pensions offer auto matic switching facilities - from shares to bonds- through 'lifestyle' schemes, Mark Green at actuary Watson Wyatt says that these are not universal. Even where they exist, people taking early retirement can be caught out. Advisers say those near retirement who have not moved their money may have to postpone retirement or accept a smaller fund. Investors who have their money in with profit funds, should be insulated from market gyrations although Mark Green thinks pension savers should also review these close to retirement, though it is important to check any possible loss of maturity bonus if switching. Equitable Life provided a reminder last week that with profit funds are not immune from market mayhem, increasing exit penalties from 10 to 15 per cent. For those with longer to go to retirement, it is impossible to withdraw pension funds as cash, so the temptation to cut and run is not one they can pursue. Some, most likely those with personal pensions, may wonder whether to switch funds. Turton warns: 'Never sell out when markets have crashed.' A troubled stock market could cast gloom over the launch of stakeholder pensions next month. Turton says investors worried about committing money can save in a cash mini Isa or corporate bond Isa until the picture is clearer. Investors may have a wider choice of stakeholder plans to choose from later in the year. Shares There is one golden rule for investors as stock markets fall: Don't panic. 'If you own shares, stick with them,' says Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. 'Selling now would only crystallise losses.' The markets have always recovered, given enough time, says Urquhart Stewart. He predicts that although there may be a few 'bear' rallies soon, the real recovery will start when the US economy starts showing signs of improving health, probably in the autumn. Jeremy King, director of private share ownership at the Proshare campaign, says many small investors have already absorbed a lot of shock, through the falls in technology stocks last year: 'While people are not happy to see the value of the market dip, there is more resignation than panic.' Ideally you should invest in the stock market only money that you can afford to forget about, so you can sell up when it suits you rather than because you are forced to by low prices. However if you do have to sell now, Proshare, which promotes share ownership, points out that if you invested your money more than a couple of years ago, your investment has probably increased in value by more than if you had left the money in a building society. Some investors may be tempted to take advantage of last week's falls to buy some cheap shares, but Urquhart Stewart advises them to keep their money on deposit for now: 'There are some very, very good value stocks out there but I'm not sure I'd buy them yet. I'd wait a few weeks.' You should also consider adopting a 'stop loss' policy in future to preserve the value of your portfolio. This involves setting a price of, for example, 20 per cent less than the amount you paid for a share. If your share falls to that point - the stop loss - you sell. Then if you still like the company, buy the share again as the price bottoms out. The stop loss should be readjusted if the share moves up in value. What will happen to my income? Income investors should come through the stock market volatility relatively unscathed. So far most of the share price falls have been in growth stocks such as technology companies that typically pay little or no dividend and, therefore, are not included in equity income funds. Income funds tend to buy shares in more established companies that offer little prospect of growth but pay a good dividend, such as banks, breweries and utilities. These are less volatile. Over the past year, the average UK growth fund has fallen by 10 per cent, while UK equity income funds have grown by 6.97 per cent, according to figures supplied by Lipper. Corporate bond funds have also done well compared with growth funds, up an average of 6.81 per cent over the past year, and prices of bonds have risen in the past week. Anna Lees-Jones, manager of M&amp;G's corporate bond fund, says this is partly because proposals announced last week could enable pension funds to use corporate bonds rather than lower-yielding gilts to underpin payouts. But she adds: 'Bonds are less volatile, and if equity markets are rough, investors do tend to move to bonds.'",

There are several different types - level term costs the same amount and pays out the same amount throughout the policy, decreasing term reduces the payout during the policy and is designed to be used with a repayment mortgage, while the family income benefit policy pays a series of regular payments from the insured person's death until the policy ends. </p> <p>Term insurance is one of the few financial products you can choose purely on cost. Ask your independent financial adviser for help in selecting a contract. Alternatively discount brokers such as TQ Direct (Tel: 0800 056 1838), and <a href=\"http://www.dlps.co.uk\"> Direct Life &amp; Pension Services</a> will find you the cheapest policy and rebate some of the initial commission. </p> <p><strong> Education</strong></p> <p> The spiralling costs of living in a city with expensive housing and iffy schooling means sooner or later couples who've opted for four or more kids tend to move out. Out to where they can afford more bedrooms, a bigger garden, and where their children stand a better chance of a decent state education. 'Outside London, even if you end up deciding to educate one or two of your children privately, it's often a lot cheaper,' says Wicks. </p> <p>But wherever you live, it's important not to forget the cost of seeing your brood through university. This now costs around \u00a36,000 per child per year all told, and the way to pay for it depends on how many years you have to save, according to Jason Hollands of independent financial adviser Best Investment. He says: 'If you've got a short time to go, you should consider zero dividend preference shares, which pay a pre-determined capital gain on a set date.' </p> <p>If you've got just one year before your child starts university, he recommends the M&amp;G Recovery zero, which will yield a return of 7.2 per cent (tax-free if you haven't used your CGT allowance) on 3 April next year. If you have three years to go, he recommends the Govett Enhanced Income zero, which has yield of 7.6 per cent and pays out on 31 March, 2004.

Once your children number more than three, an ordinary car won't do any more.

Checking the costs of a \u00a310,000 car loan over three years on the latter site produced an 8.7 per cent APR loan with Lloyds TSB Loan Direct, costing \u00a3315.08 a month. </p> <p><strong> Holidays</strong></p> <p> Holidays are another big expense. Karen Simmonds, who runs the Balham-based family travel specialist Travel Matters in south London, says the cheapest option for a family with four children aged between four and 10 would probably set them back around \u00a31,400 for campsite accommodation in the Vend\u00e9e region of France, including the ferry crossing in mid-summer. </p> <p>'For those with a bit more to spend, a self-catering holiday in Corsica would come in at around \u00a34,200 for flights, accommodation and transfers.' Cheaper still, of course, is to stay in Britain and hire a big house near the sea (out of season for a bargain) or even an entire youth hostel (really cheap, especially if you team up with another large family). </p> <p><strong> Food</strong></p> <p> If holidays are optional - and some, of course, would argue that they shouldn't be - the weekly shop certainly isn't. 'Don't go to Tesco's more than once a week,' is Wicks's advice. Buying in bulk makes a lot of sense, and eating pre-prepared convenience food is out of the question - an M&amp;S ready meal for three or four might be OK as a blow-out treat, but for six or seven it's an impossible indulgence. </p> <p><strong> Clothes</strong></p> <p> When it comes to clothes you'd think a family with four or five children would be able to hand everything down and hardly ever go shopping - but you'd be wrong.

Before an insurance salesman can begin selling products, they must pass a benchmark exam called the financial planning certificate (FPC). They follow a course that requires 240 hours of study, then sit three different exams on subjects such as income tax and portfolio planning. The adviser can start selling after passing the first exam, but only under supervision. They are not allowed to operate on their own until they have passed all three. The FPC, which is also sat by independent financial advisers, is being reviewed by the Financial Services Authority. It is an old exam and there are concerns that it is out of step with the current market, particularly with regard to investments. But experts say the real fault may lie with post-exam professional development, such as it is. The Life Insurance Association, the professional body that represents 12,000 direct salespeople and 10,000 IFAs, wants to standardise continuing professional development in conjunction with several other organisations, including the FSA. Allied Dunbar will certainly be taking follow-up training more seriously from now on. In future the life office will subject its agents to a five-day annual training regime, which will culminate in an exam. In the meantime, how do you judge the competence of a salesperson or an IFA? You can recognise what exams they have by looking at the letters after their name. If a salesman has no letters ask him which exams he has passed. Members of the Society of Financial Advisers use the letters FPC but LIA members use MLIADip for the same qualification. While FPC is the minimum required by regulators, it is by no means the only exam. Advisers can take others, including the advanced finance planning certificate (AFPC), which is like an A-level to FPC's GCSE. It tests subjects such as tax law and pensions through in-depth case studies. Only 5,500 advisers hold all parts of this qualification at present. The Society of Financial Advisers can put you in touch with an adviser who has passed the advanced FPC exam through its website: www.sofa.org. Theoretically, a salesman can notch up 24 letters after his or her name, although no one is thought to have reached this enormous total. The FSA realises the proliferation of letters is bewildering and plans to simplify the alphabet soup.",
