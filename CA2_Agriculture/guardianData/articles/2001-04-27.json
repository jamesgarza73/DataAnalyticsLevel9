His \u00a319m transfer from PSV Eindhoven, the most expensive in the history of English football, will tie him to Manchester United for the next five years, representing the prime of a career that he must have feared had reached a premature conclusion a year ago, when he collapsed during a training session with a serious knee injury.</p> <p>For Manchester United, on the other hand, such days are nothing new. In August 1958, rebuilding his team after the Munich disaster, Matt Busby paid Sheffield Wednesday a British-record fee of \u00a345,000 for Albert Quixall, a dashing goalscorer. Four years later he set another record by bringing Denis Law back from Torino for \u00a3115,000. Since then the story of Manchester United has been studded with the arrivals of expensive strikers.</p> <p>Some of the glittering acquisitions, such as Joe Jordan and Andy Cole, have been unqualified successes in the red shirt. Others, including Ted McDougall and Garry Birtles, have endured prolonged public humiliations. But a period of adjustment is always necessary, particularly when, like Van Nistelrooy, the player comes from a different football culture.</p> <p>\"The initial few weeks will be frenetic for him,\" Sir Alex predicted. \"He'll take a while to get used to the speed of the game from one end of the pitch to the other in the Premier League. But he'll adjust. They always do.\"</p> <p>Although Van Nistelrooy will see out the remainder of the season at PSV, with whom he hopes to complete the Dutch league and cup double, he provided a preface to his United career yesterday with a self-assured performance in front of the British media. \"The expectations will be high, from everybody around me,\" he acknowledged. \"But my personal expectations are even higher, so that's no problem.\"</p> <p>As a boy, he continued, the great Old Trafford sides of the past had not figured among the posters on his bedroom wall, where pride of place went to Marco van Basten and Diego Maradona - \"Remember, in 1986 I was 10 years old.\" But he was certainly an admirer. \"Lots of players dream of playing for this club,\"' he said, \"and for me it's the same. In the last few years they have won so many trophies, and always with good football. In every position they have players who are special, and for me it's nice to be able to play and train with them.\"</p> <p>Invited to estimate the number of goals he will score in his first season, bearing in mind the size of his transfer fee, he declined with a smile. \"You mean how many pounds per goal? No, I have my own thoughts about how many goals and at the end of the season I will tell you if they came true.\"</p> <p>But confidence, he believes, will not be a problem. \"When a big club like this one pays so much money, it means they have confidence in you. So that gives me confidence, too. I don't feel it's a pressure. It lifts me up.\"</p> <p>He had never doubted that he would end up at Manchester United, even during the darkest hours of his rehabilitation, and repeated his gratitude to Sir Alex for staying in touch during a long year. \"That was very special for me. We talked a lot about people who had the same injury. When you have support like that, it gives you a good feeling.\"</p> <p>For Ferguson, the player's country of origin provided a reassurance. \"I think the Dutch football mentality is one of quality,\" he said. \"That's what they concentrate on, so anyone who comes from there to a club like ours has had a very good preparation. Ruud has a very good understanding of the game, and he has a presence on field, which is important at a club like ours.\"</p> <p>Although Old Trafford is accustomed to such events, there is a sense that this week's signing has a special significance in terms of the club's evolution. Van Nistelrooy's arrival was planned long before Roy Keane voiced his criticisms of the squad this week, but such an investment in talent signals the club's intention to mark the last of Ferguson's 16 seasons in charge by recapturing the European Cup, nowadays the true focus of their efforts.</p> <p>Invited to comment yesterday on the need to \"'freshen things up\"' within the club, Sir Alex gave a characteristically testy reply: \"I'm not going into that.\" But it would be no surprise if the coming weeks saw an additional capture to parallel that almost 40 years ago of Pat Crerand, who arrived from Celtic in the same summer as Denis Law, costing less than half the money but going on to exert just as profound an effect on the glittering team of the mid-60s.

      "trailText": "<p>With the transfer system facing extinction, transfer fees continue to imitate the diplodocus, a creature of vast size but little sense.</p>",
      "byline": "David Lacey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The transfer system, it is said, will soon be as extinct as the dinosaur. In the meantime transfer fees continue to imitate the diplodocus, a creature of vast size but little sense. Yesterday Ruud van Nistelrooy, the Dutch striker who at \u00a319m is the latest player to break the British transfer record, was formally unveiled at Manchester United. Last November Rio Ferdinand moved from West Ham United to Leeds United for \u00a318m and last June Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, whom Leeds had previously sold to Atletico Madrid for \u00a312m, joined Chelsea for \u00a315m.</p> <p>No wonder the season has a few rings around the eyes. Far from stifling the transfer market, the European Commission's attempt to end the trade in bootlegged kickers appears to have stimulated it. The bigger the fees the greater the doubts about their wisdom. When Alf Common joined Middlesbrough from Sunderland for \u00a31,000 in 1905 the amount was widely considered obscene.</p> <p>The first worry, which applies to all transactions, is that a serious injury will end whatever hopes a manager had of improving his team with a big buy. Neither Pierluigi Casiraghi nor Luc Nilis was a seven-figure signing but the sudden termination of their playing careers, at Chelsea and Aston Villa, was still a reminder of how precarious the professional footballer's trade is.</p> <p>Then there is the matter of the buyer's judgement in assessing first a player's ability and then the effect he is likely to have on the team. Since most managers and coaches are former league professionals who have been in the game since their teens it might be thought that such experience would minimise the chance of error, yet this is not always the case.</p> <p>A glance through the lengthening list of players for whom English clubs have spent \u00a310m or more suggests that little has changed since October 1980, when Manchester United paid Nottingham Forest \u00a31.25m for Garry Birtles, a striker who then did not score a league goal for nearly a year. Though many big transfers work, there will always be spectacular failures.</p> <p>Quite often it is a case of incompatibility, the square-peg syndrome. In recent seasons few pegs have come squarer, or more expensive, than Chris Sutton, whose \u00a310m move from Blackburn Rovers to Chelsea two years ago was doomed from the start. As a striker with Norwich and Blackburn, Sutton successfully combined strength and accuracy in the air with skilful feet and a sharp eye for scoring opportunities. He was at his best when partnering Alan Shearer at Ewood Park.</p> <p>The pair were perfect in a Rovers team that complemented wing play and good crosses with tight passing where it mattered. At Stamford Bridge, however, Sutton suffered because, in addition to fitness problems, the strongest aspects of his game were alien to a style that demanded the ball played to feet, obviating the need for a target figure. Even the lofty Tore Andre Flo never quite became that.</p> <p>Sutton, like Flo, is now plying his trade in the slightly less demanding, though highly competitive, Scottish League. Rangers paid Chelsea \u00a312m for Flo last November, an amount that may yet be justified if, despite the margin of Celtic's championship triumph, they make a decent showing in Europe next season.

      "bodyText": "The transfer system, it is said, will soon be as extinct as the dinosaur. In the meantime transfer fees continue to imitate the diplodocus, a creature of vast size but little sense. Yesterday Ruud van Nistelrooy, the Dutch striker who at \u00a319m is the latest player to break the British transfer record, was formally unveiled at Manchester United. Last November Rio Ferdinand moved from West Ham United to Leeds United for \u00a318m and last June Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, whom Leeds had previously sold to Atletico Madrid for \u00a312m, joined Chelsea for \u00a315m. No wonder the season has a few rings around the eyes. Far from stifling the transfer market, the European Commission's attempt to end the trade in bootlegged kickers appears to have stimulated it. The bigger the fees the greater the doubts about their wisdom. When Alf Common joined Middlesbrough from Sunderland for \u00a31,000 in 1905 the amount was widely considered obscene. The first worry, which applies to all transactions, is that a serious injury will end whatever hopes a manager had of improving his team with a big buy. Neither Pierluigi Casiraghi nor Luc Nilis was a seven-figure signing but the sudden termination of their playing careers, at Chelsea and Aston Villa, was still a reminder of how precarious the professional footballer's trade is. Then there is the matter of the buyer's judgement in assessing first a player's ability and then the effect he is likely to have on the team. Since most managers and coaches are former league professionals who have been in the game since their teens it might be thought that such experience would minimise the chance of error, yet this is not always the case. A glance through the lengthening list of players for whom English clubs have spent \u00a310m or more suggests that little has changed since October 1980, when Manchester United paid Nottingham Forest \u00a31.25m for Garry Birtles, a striker who then did not score a league goal for nearly a year. Though many big transfers work, there will always be spectacular failures. Quite often it is a case of incompatibility, the square-peg syndrome. In recent seasons few pegs have come squarer, or more expensive, than Chris Sutton, whose \u00a310m move from Blackburn Rovers to Chelsea two years ago was doomed from the start. As a striker with Norwich and Blackburn, Sutton successfully combined strength and accuracy in the air with skilful feet and a sharp eye for scoring opportunities. He was at his best when partnering Alan Shearer at Ewood Park. The pair were perfect in a Rovers team that complemented wing play and good crosses with tight passing where it mattered. At Stamford Bridge, however, Sutton suffered because, in addition to fitness problems, the strongest aspects of his game were alien to a style that demanded the ball played to feet, obviating the need for a target figure. Even the lofty Tore Andre Flo never quite became that. Sutton, like Flo, is now plying his trade in the slightly less demanding, though highly competitive, Scottish League. Rangers paid Chelsea \u00a312m for Flo last November, an amount that may yet be justified if, despite the margin of Celtic's championship triumph, they make a decent showing in Europe next season. None of the English game's other seven-figure buys have flopped in the manner of Sutton, although Sylvain Wiltord is still some way short of justifying the \u00a313m that Arsenal paid Bordeaux for his services last August. Then again, some players will take longer to acclimatise than others. The potential of Thierry Henry, who cost Arsenal \u00a310.5m from Juventus, has been realised only since Ars\u00c1ene Wenger persuaded him he could be a better central striker than a winger. The bigger the fee the greater the tendency to doubt the wisdom of the purchase. The \u00a318m David O'Leary spent on Ferdinand was accompanied by much critical tut-tutting but since then the former West Ham defender has become a better player and if his efforts help to get Leeds into next season's Champions League, one way or the other, then the outlay will have been justified. So it will be for Manchester United if Van Nistelrooy's goals take Sir Alex Ferguson nearer to another European Cup triumph next season than his team did this time and for Liverpool, whose \u00a311m investment in Emile Heskey has already seen the team reach both domestic cup finals and the Uefa Cup final. It is the clubs who are less likely to win things or get into the Champions League that need to think twice about joining the really big spenders. For example, did Tottenham pay Dynamo Kiev \u00a311m for Sergei Rebrov simply to prove how innately ordinary was the rest of the team by comparison? And was Juan Pablo Angel, the Colombian striker who had caught many a European eye at River Plate, fully aware of what he was letting himself in for at Aston Villa when he signed for \u00cb9.5m? Angel is not so much a square peg as a lonely little petunia in an onion patch. Surely one good reason for ending the transfer system is to save some clubs and their managers from themselves.",

      "byline": "Daniel Taylor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is five months since Rio Ferdinand left West Ham and the East End but, judging by his current choice of literature, it is fair to say he still has a passing interest in his old manor. He is midway through Hard Bastards which is not, as might be assumed, a tribute to Stuart Pearce and Julian Dicks but a Who's Who of the London underworld by Kate Kray, widow of Ronnie. \"It's a good book,\" he says with a smile. \"Just a little bit of light reading.\"</p> <p>Ferdinand, who lines up for Leeds against Chelsea today, has had time to indulge his passion for reading recently - bags of time, in fact. His move to Leeds may have taken him away from his roots but, as he points out, it has also taken him away from temptation. He is settling into a picture-book village near Wetherby and the tranquillity of rural Yorkshire - living in the sticks, as he puts it - suits him to the ground. He is fast becoming an advertisement for the benefits of a quiet life.</p> <p>He did worry. After spending all his life in London, the vast majority of it growing up on the Friary estate in Peckham, it was only natural to be consumed by a few what-ifs. Yet it seems a long time ago now since he was asking his parents, Julian and Janine, whether he was making the right decision to head north. \"It surprises me to say it but I don't miss London at all,\" he says. \"I thought I would be homesick, miss all the attractions of big-city life and all that, but I actually feel a lot more comfortable out here.</p> <p>\"There are a lot more distractions down there, not just the nightlife but everything that goes with being in the capital. There was always something going on after training. Looking back, it was good to get out when I did. Now I just come home and watch television or read. It's a lot slower pace of life and it gives me a lot more time to think about football and focus on my game.\"</p> <p>The first thing that is noticeable about Ferdinand is how relaxed he is in unfamiliar company. The second is how unpretentious he is, totally unassuming, level-headed. David O'Leary, his manager, eulogises not only about an outstanding young player but also an outstanding young man, eager to learn and smouldering with a desire to better himself. Probe deeper and it emerges that Ferdinand has quietly gone about involving himself in the local community, making regular trips to the most deprived areas of Leeds. The \u00a318m man may be big-time but this is no big-time Charlie.</p> <p>To the media he is courtesy personified. Like every Premiership club, Leeds have their fair share of players who would rather chew a cockroach than chew the fat with a journalist. Ferdinand, however, is cute enough to understand the benefits of a good press. It says a lot about him that eight days ago, 24 hours before his first match back at Upton Park, he sacrificed his lunch so as not to disappoint the assembled corps. To many people that may not seem much but write a list of which other members of football's Millionaires' Row would do the same: it would not cover the back of a half-time raffle ticket.</p> <p>\"It's the way my family brought me up. My parents always drummed it into me to be grateful for everything I've got because there is always someone out there who needs more than you,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I'm not money-mad, never have been, and I can see the bigger picture. When you look at the news there are a lot of bad things happening all over the world. Sometimes it's easy for us as footballers to moan about little things and forget there are people out there who would love to be in our shoes. We should never overlook how fortunate we are to be where we are. I come from a poor area and I'm not going to forget that.\"</p> <p>When we met at Leeds' Thorp Arch training ground on Thursday Ferdinand was slightly late because, according to Dominic Matteo, he was \"playing his music in the gymnasium and dancing all over the place\". Integrating into new surroundings is never easy but the 22-year-old seems to have eased into Leeds as into a comfortable old slipper.</p> <p>It was a difficult start. After losing four of his first six games, including shipping three goals in the opening 30 minutes of a bilious debut at Leicester, Ferdinand can remember looking at West Ham's results and thinking: \"Bloody hell, what have I let myself in for here?\"</p> <p>Deep down, though, he knew he had made a sound career move.

Cash is king when it comes to playing in Europe and qualification for the Champions League can provide an unparalleled financial boost.</p> <p>Last season Manchester United were knocked out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage, a relative disappointment, but still made \u00a326m from the competition - more than eight Premiership clubs made in their entire season.</p> <p>\"Europe is becoming the main course, not the dessert it once was,\" said Gerry Boon, author of an annual report into football finances by the financial experts Deloitte &amp; Touche. \"When players win the FA or Worthington cups now, they are quoted as saying 'we're glad that we have qualified for Europe'. This demonstrates how domestic Cup competitions have become a means to an end, rather than an end in itself.\"</p> <p>Few clubs realise that more than Liverpool and Ipswich, two teams already sure of European football next season but still scrapping for promotion to the Champions League. Neither will now be happy with anything less. Liverpool said as much last season but Gerard Houllier's side missed out to Leeds United by a whisker. The Anfield accounts department must be praying that it does not happen again.</p> <p>Their large squad has left them with a wage bill of \u00a340m, one of the highest in the country. Last year 70% of all the money it turned over during the season went straight into players' pockets - the biggest proportional spend of the top five clubs in the Premiership and more than Deloitte &amp; Touche say is healthy for any club looking to sustain a long-term business.</p> <p>\"The Champions League is a necessity for a club with a wage bill like Liverpool's but for Ipswich it would be like Christmas coming twice,\" said Nick Batram, an analyst at the City stockbrokers Granville Baird. At Ipswich's Portman Road ground one can feel the excitement the prospect of the club's first European action since 1982-83 is generating. One year after promotion from the First Division the club are on the verge of lining up against sides like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and AC Milan.</p> <p>Earlier this week Ipswich were granted conditional planning consent for a new North Stand, which will raise the capacity to more than 30,000. But European football could have a more immediate impact, adding huge sums to annual turnover and transforming their manager George Burley's ability in the transfer market.</p> <p>Leeds have bought big this season off the back of their European run, paying \u00a318m for Rio Ferdinand, \u00a37.2m for Olivier Dacourt and \u00a36m for Mark Viduka. Next year, unbelievably, Ipswich could compete. In smaller leagues like Holland, Scotland, Portugal and Belgium the impact of European competition is even more stark. At Rosenborg in Norway domestic competition has become a financial afterthought with the Champions League making up more than 50% of annual income.</p> <p>Clubs in those smaller leagues want to combine to create a 'sixth force' in European football - a TV market to match the five big leagues of England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. They may be too late. \"The harsh reality is that there already is a sixth force in European football, and that is the Champions League,\" said Boon. Increasingly those outside that market are finding they are no longer in the game.</p> <p><strong>Leeds' share of the Euro cash-cow </strong></p> <p>1st group stage: \u00a31.83m for qualifying plus \u00a3203,500 for each win and \u00a3100,000 per draw Total (two wins, three draws): \u00a32.543m 2nd group stage: \u00a31.83m, performance-related bonuses as before Total (three wins, one draw): \u00a32.541m Quarter-finals: \u00a31.63m Semi-finals: \u00a32.04m Total so far: \u00a38.754m </p> <p>TV money: Leeds' share \u00a34.4m (England's share \u00a322m) Other income: Ticket sales, merchandise, corporate hospitality, other matchday income \u00a310m Total so far: \u00a323.154m Runners-up bonus: \u00a32.44m Winners' bonus: \u00a34.07m Additional revenue from final: \u00a32.8m </p> <p>Possible total: \u00a330.024m </p>",

Last year 70% of all the money it turned over during the season went straight into players' pockets - the biggest proportional spend of the top five clubs in the Premiership and more than Deloitte &amp; Touche say is healthy for any club looking to sustain a long-term business. \"The Champions League is a necessity for a club with a wage bill like Liverpool's but for Ipswich it would be like Christmas coming twice,\" said Nick Batram, an analyst at the City stockbrokers Granville Baird. At Ipswich's Portman Road ground one can feel the excitement the prospect of the club's first European action since 1982-83 is generating. One year after promotion from the First Division the club are on the verge of lining up against sides like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and AC Milan. Earlier this week Ipswich were granted conditional planning consent for a new North Stand, which will raise the capacity to more than 30,000. But European football could have a more immediate impact, adding huge sums to annual turnover and transforming their manager George Burley's ability in the transfer market. Leeds have bought big this season off the back of their European run, paying \u00a318m for Rio Ferdinand, \u00a37.2m for Olivier Dacourt and \u00a36m for Mark Viduka. Next year, unbelievably, Ipswich could compete. In smaller leagues like Holland, Scotland, Portugal and Belgium the impact of European competition is even more stark. At Rosenborg in Norway domestic competition has become a financial afterthought with the Champions League making up more than 50% of annual income. Clubs in those smaller leagues want to combine to create a 'sixth force' in European football - a TV market to match the five big leagues of England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. They may be too late. \"The harsh reality is that there already is a sixth force in European football, and that is the Champions League,\" said Boon. Increasingly those outside that market are finding they are no longer in the game. Leeds' share of the Euro cash-cow 1st group stage: \u00a31.83m for qualifying plus \u00a3203,500 for each win and \u00a3100,000 per draw Total (two wins, three draws): \u00a32.543m 2nd group stage: \u00a31.83m, performance-related bonuses as before Total (three wins, one draw): \u00a32.541m Quarter-finals: \u00a31.63m Semi-finals: \u00a32.04m Total so far: \u00a38.754m TV money: Leeds' share \u00a34.4m (England's share \u00a322m) Other income: Ticket sales, merchandise, corporate hospitality, other matchday income \u00a310m Total so far: \u00a323.154m Runners-up bonus: \u00a32.44m Winners' bonus: \u00a34.07m Additional revenue from final: \u00a32.8m Possible total: \u00a330.024m",

      "body": "<p>Arsene Wenger insisted yesterday that Arsenal would match Manchester United's spending - if that would make the Gunners \"special\" - but said that plunging into the market immediately was \"dangerous\".</p> <p>Arsenal's manager wants to bring in at least three signings for next season and suggested that Sunderland's striker Kevin Phillips and Barcelona's unhappy midfielder Emmanuel Petit, who left Highbury only last summer, are among them.</p> <p>Phillips, who together with Sunderland's manager Peter Reid yesterday dismissed reports that he had asked for a transfer, is one of a number of the English players that Wenger \"has in mind\". Phillips has had a disappointing season, both with his club and country-wise, and Wenger said of the striker: \"I have not made up my mind yet.\"</p> <p>The Hertfordshire-born Phillips was the Premiership's top scorer with 30 goals last season, but in this campaign he has scored only 11 times in the league. He suffered further disappointment last month when he was dropped from the England squad by Sven-Goran Eriksson.</p> <p>Of Petit, who has had limited opportunities at Barcelona, Wenger said: \"Although we have had no contact with him, I know he wants to come back to London. Other clubs may be interested but he loved it at Arsenal and I personally feel he is still a great player.\"</p> <p>If Arsenal are unlikely to pay more than \u00a35m to bring the 30-year-old French international back, Wenger insisted he would go much higher - indeed match United's British-record \u00a319m for Ruud van Nistelrooy. \"Yes,\" said Wenger, \"I could see myself paying that kind of fee if we thought we could get somebody who would help us do something special.\"</p> <p>But he suggested that United, by spending now rather than later, may have paid over the top for the Dutch striker. \"I think prices in the overseas transfer market could drop by as much as 20% per cent this summer. It looks as if the market has not gone down yet, and everybody seems to be acting like it won't change, but I think that is a dangerous game to play.\"</p> <p>Although Arsenal are seeking a new goalkeeper, David Seaman has extended his contract for another 12 months, keeping the England international, 37, at Highbury for a 12th season. Wenger praised Seaman's performances and physical condition after a season disrupted by shoulder and ankle injuries.</p> <p>Glenn Hoddle, who has also been linked with a move for Petit, is celebrating his first \"signing\" as Tottenham's manager after Les Ferdinand, 34, agreed a new two-year contract with the club.</p> <p>Southampton want to interview Brighton's Micky Adams for the manager's job at the Dell which was vacated with Hoddle's departure for Spurs. Talks are planned in the next few days after an official approach to Brighton, who hope to clinch the Third Division championship this afternoon. Adams has been shortlisted by Saints but Kevin Keegan is still strongly tipped for the job.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Arsene Wenger insisted yesterday that Arsenal would match Manchester United's spending - if that would make the Gunners \"special\" - but said that plunging into the market immediately was \"dangerous\". Arsenal's manager wants to bring in at least three signings for next season and suggested that Sunderland's striker Kevin Phillips and Barcelona's unhappy midfielder Emmanuel Petit, who left Highbury only last summer, are among them. Phillips, who together with Sunderland's manager Peter Reid yesterday dismissed reports that he had asked for a transfer, is one of a number of the English players that Wenger \"has in mind\". Phillips has had a disappointing season, both with his club and country-wise, and Wenger said of the striker: \"I have not made up my mind yet.\" The Hertfordshire-born Phillips was the Premiership's top scorer with 30 goals last season, but in this campaign he has scored only 11 times in the league. He suffered further disappointment last month when he was dropped from the England squad by Sven-Goran Eriksson. Of Petit, who has had limited opportunities at Barcelona, Wenger said: \"Although we have had no contact with him, I know he wants to come back to London. Other clubs may be interested but he loved it at Arsenal and I personally feel he is still a great player.\" If Arsenal are unlikely to pay more than \u00a35m to bring the 30-year-old French international back, Wenger insisted he would go much higher - indeed match United's British-record \u00a319m for Ruud van Nistelrooy. \"Yes,\" said Wenger, \"I could see myself paying that kind of fee if we thought we could get somebody who would help us do something special.\" But he suggested that United, by spending now rather than later, may have paid over the top for the Dutch striker. \"I think prices in the overseas transfer market could drop by as much as 20% per cent this summer. It looks as if the market has not gone down yet, and everybody seems to be acting like it won't change, but I think that is a dangerous game to play.\" Although Arsenal are seeking a new goalkeeper, David Seaman has extended his contract for another 12 months, keeping the England international, 37, at Highbury for a 12th season. Wenger praised Seaman's performances and physical condition after a season disrupted by shoulder and ankle injuries. Glenn Hoddle, who has also been linked with a move for Petit, is celebrating his first \"signing\" as Tottenham's manager after Les Ferdinand, 34, agreed a new two-year contract with the club. Southampton want to interview Brighton's Micky Adams for the manager's job at the Dell which was vacated with Hoddle's departure for Spurs. Talks are planned in the next few days after an official approach to Brighton, who hope to clinch the Third Division championship this afternoon. Adams has been shortlisted by Saints but Kevin Keegan is still strongly tipped for the job.",

      "bodyText": "We intend having children so when will the scheme begin? Probably not until 2003 at the earliest. Assuming Labour is re-elected, first details will be in the Pre-Budget Report in November this year. It will require legislation (via the Finance Bill) which will then give a start date, probably the financial year beginning April 6, 2003. How much will each child receive? A minimum of \u00a3250 on birth plus three \u00a350 extra donations before the age of 18, totalling \u00a3400.

      "bodyText": "With a turbulent stock market and mortgage interest rates at their lowest level in 36 years, more people might be tempted to look at renting out property as an alternative investment, writes Pamela Swinburne . Many are buying investment property to boost eventual pensions through the ever-expanding buy-to-let market. The idea is that rentals should at least cover the mortgage and other expenses, such as insurance and letting agents. Landlords hope to make their big gains from capital growth. Buy-to-let mortgages are more affordable than they were five years ago and there is fierce competition among lenders, with rates as low as 3.75% and deposits of around 20%. Often they are the same cost as residential loans, ending the old practice of forcing buyers of investment properties to borrow at steep commercial rates. The long-term outlook for investment properties looks good, according to the Association of Residential Letting Agents, which says it is expected to grow from 11.2% of the market to 15% in the next five years. And new figures from the agents Savills show that the average net yield after expenses stands at 6.5% - enough to cover many current loans. But as more people are lured into the buy-to-let market and the mortgage war hots up, where do you begin to trawl through the hundreds of packages on offer? How do you decide whether to go for a capped, fixed, discounted or variable rate? Some have penalties while others don't lock you in at all. You need to shop around carefully. According to Nichola Pincher, from Chase De Vere Mortgage Management, the best buys for buy-to-let mortgages include Britannic Money's 5.99% fixed rate for two years with no penalties; Mortgage Express's 5.99% fixed rate for three years and Bank of Ireland's 6.39% fixed rate for five years. When comparing schemes, it is important to weigh up costs, as lower rates may have bigger penalties, and to take into account any arrangement fee. For instance, Bank of Ireland does not charge an arrangement fee but it has steep penalties during the fixed rate term, whereas Britannic Money charges a 1% fee but does not charge any penalty. Ms Pincher explains that there are standard mortgage products available through most intermediaries and on the high street, but larger intermediaries such as her own firm, or Charcol or Savills, may have some exclusive deals because of their big portfolios. Karen Garner, of Charcol, says her company's best deals are Mortgage Express's rate of 6.35% fixed until June 2006, with an 80% loan and 1% fee; Scottish Widows at 6.25% fixed until June 2003, 80% loan, 3% penalty, with a \u00a3295 booking fee and a 0.5% arrangement fee. A fixed deal without penalties comes from the Royal Bank of Scotland, which offers 6.15% until July 2003. But buying the wrong property can be an even more expensive mistake than a flutter on the stock market. One of the key things to remember is location - convenience, safety and access to public transport are crucial. It is imperative that you factor into calculations the void periods when you have no tenant. When buying property to rent out consider the running costs, rental return, fees, maintenance and service charges as well as rental growth and capital gains. Deductions against tax on rents received may be claimed for the following: repairs, maintenance costs, insurance, cleaning, commission and other management expenses. A wear and tear allowance of 10% of the rent received may be deductible.",

But Mr Blair can draw comfort from the young adults of schools in Watford polled by Jobs &amp; Money (see opposite); their attitude to spending is more like Saffie than Patsy or Edina in Absolutely Fabulous. The big battalions from the financial services industry lined up by Tony Blair at the launch of the Child Trust Fund - including Halifax, Nationwide, Prudential and M&amp;G - immediately gave their blessing to the concept.

If they have less than three, they may be eligible for the 7.24% rate, whereas eight judgments and some missed mortgage payments over the past 12 months will nudge them up to the 8.74% bracket. \"People run into financial trouble for a whole variety of reasons,\" Sun Bank says. \"You may have been involved in a messy, expensive divorce, or your business may have failed through no fault of your own. This doesn't mean that you don't know how to manage your finances, just that you hit a bad patch. \"Provided an applicant is coming out of their bad patch and is not still accumulating debt, we are happy to consider his or her personal circumstances.\" Once clients are back on track they should be able to get loans on normal terms. Most higher risk lenders allow penalty-free switches after three to four years.",

Leao did everything he could. But on the pitch we have to do better.\" Leao put a brave face on the result. \"A draw at home, under any circumstance, is a dreadful result,\" he admitted. \"We're not in decline; it's just that at the moment we're not doing well.\" </p> <p>Leao, who played in goal for Brazil during the 70s, has only been in charge for five games. Already his popularity is sinking to the levels attained by the former incumbent Wanderley Luxemburgo. </p> <p>Luxemburgo was sacked after the Under-23 team was beaten by Cameroon, reduced to nine men, in the Sydney Olympics - although, ironically, he has subsequently been responsible for turning the Corinthians midfield plucked by Leao into perhaps the best in the Brazilian league. </p> <p>Brazil have several mitigating factors - although none can excuse its dire performances. With the South America's teams contained in one qualifying group there has been a considerable increase in the number of games played, but now that more Brazilians play in Europe than ever before, there is less time for the team to train together. </p> <p>The congressional investigations in the capital Brasilia point to corruption at every level of the game - from the forging of birth certificates of teenage players to tax evasion and fraud by the largest clubs. The malaise seems to have affected the players. </p> <p>\"We got what we deserved, thanks to the vampires who have sucked the last drops of sweat and blood from our football and left only the tears,\" said columnist Juca Kfouri in sports daily Lance. </p> <p>Few people believe that Brazil will fail to qualify but there is a genuine worry that they could finish in fifth place. </p> <p>Brazil have a run of three tough games in the next few months. First they play Uruguay in Montevideo, next come Paraguay in Rio and then Argentina in Buenos Aires. And Brazil have yet to play Bolivia in the high, thin air of La Paz. Argentina nearly lost there on Wednesday, forcing a 3-3 draw in injury-time. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Already his popularity is sinking to the levels attained by the former incumbent Wanderley Luxemburgo. Luxemburgo was sacked after the Under-23 team was beaten by Cameroon, reduced to nine men, in the Sydney Olympics - although, ironically, he has subsequently been responsible for turning the Corinthians midfield plucked by Leao into perhaps the best in the Brazilian league. Brazil have several mitigating factors - although none can excuse its dire performances. With the South America's teams contained in one qualifying group there has been a considerable increase in the number of games played, but now that more Brazilians play in Europe than ever before, there is less time for the team to train together. The congressional investigations in the capital Brasilia point to corruption at every level of the game - from the forging of birth certificates of teenage players to tax evasion and fraud by the largest clubs. The malaise seems to have affected the players. \"We got what we deserved, thanks to the vampires who have sucked the last drops of sweat and blood from our football and left only the tears,\" said columnist Juca Kfouri in sports daily Lance. Few people believe that Brazil will fail to qualify but there is a genuine worry that they could finish in fifth place. Brazil have a run of three tough games in the next few months. First they play Uruguay in Montevideo, next come Paraguay in Rio and then Argentina in Buenos Aires. And Brazil have yet to play Bolivia in the high, thin air of La Paz. Argentina nearly lost there on Wednesday, forcing a 3-3 draw in injury-time. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Pulis, who denies the blackmail plot, also told Scally he would be leaving the club the day after the Wembley play-off, which Gillingham lost on penalties. </p> <p>Giving evidence on the third day of his wrongful dismissal suit against the club, Pulis said he was \"angry and frustrated\" after hearing on the morning of May 26 that \u00a362,000 he had been paid in lieu of changes to his contract had been withdrawn from his pension fund. In addition to the \u00a362,000, Pulis said he was owed around \u00a3140,000 from the sale of Ade Akinbiyi, James Corbett and Iffy Onuora, making a rough total of \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>Pulis told the court that shortly after hearing the \u00a362,000 had been withdrawn Maurice Saffery, an accounts clerk at Gillingham, came to his office carrying a briefcase and a brown envelope containing the documents. \"Maurice Saffery told me that Paul Scally was misappropriating funds through gate receipts and other ways,\" Pulis told the court. </p> <p>Pulis said he was furious and took the document from the brown envelope and sought out Scally. \"We stood in a row of spectator seats in the stand on the far side of the pitch,\" Pulis said under cross-examination by Nicholas Mostyn QC, representing Gillingham. </p> <p>\"I asked him,\" 'Are you not paying me the money because the club is in trouble?'\" Pulis then produced a nine-page document marked Wycombe Wanderers from his shorts. He had put it there he said because he had no pockets. </p> <p>The court was read part of a statement made by Scally in which he said: \"He told me if I didn't pay him \u00a3200,000 he said he had a suitcase of stuff he would give to the police and inland revenue. I remember thinking, 'I need this like a hole in the head'. The biggest game in the club's history was four days away.\" </p> <p>Later that day, Pulis said, he took the briefcase to Norman Hayward, a family friend who was chairman of AFC Bournemouth when Pulis was manager at the club. He said he did this because he did not know where else to take the documents. Hayward passed them to Roy Pack, a self-styled investigator of alleged corruption in football. Asked why he had taken them to Hayward and not the Football League, Pulis said: \"I took them to people I thought could deal with it.\" </p> <p>In fact, said Mr Mostyn, Pulis was motivated by greed and a desire to cause as much harm as possible to Scally and Gillingham. \"Your story is a pack of lies,\" said Mr Mostyn. \"There was a sordid conspiracy between you, Mr Hayward and Mr Pack, to blackmail Mr Scally, sell the story to the tabloids and to damage the club badly. </p> <p>\"It was naked blackmail and you set it up with the theft and concocted it with Mr Pack and Mr Hayward. That's the truth isn't it?\" Pulis denied this. The court heard that the day before the meeting in the stand Pulis had spoken four times with Hayward on his mobile phone. </p> <p>Mr Mostyn said that far from receiving the documents from Saffery, Pulis stole the documents. Saffery would deny any involvement, the court heard. </p> <p>Pulis gave them to Hayward because he knew his former boss had a grudge against Scally. After AFC Bournemouth went into administration in January 1997 Hayward launched a bid, assisted by Pack, to win back control of the club. The Football League Commission, of which Scally was then a member, rejected their bid. \"You knew, did you not, that Mr Scally was instrumental in having that bid rejected?,\" Mr Mostyn asked. Pulis denied this. </p> <p>On receiving the documents Pack, who is acting as a consultant to Pulis in this case, took them to the publicist Max Clifford who sold them to the Daily Mail. A copy was also sent to the FA, which took no action. Clifford then tipped off the Daily Express about the documents, the court heard. \"It's a monstrous situation that they [the documents] are being peddled up and down Grub Street,\" said Mr Mostyn. </p> <p>Pulis denied accusing Scally of using club money to build an extension and swimming pool at his Kent home, and of buying cars for his wife and son and a Harley Davidson with club funds. He also denied making allegations of financial irregularities concerning the building company Dunning &amp; Carter, which is carrying out work on a new stand and offices at the Priestfield stadium and at Scally's home.

      "bodyText": "The news consortium put together by Sky, Bloomberg, CBS, Chrysalis and Ulster TV has formally applied to the ITC for nomination as the official ITV news provider. The consortium, called Channel Three News Ltd, wants to take over the contract from ITN, which has held the ITV news contract since the launch of independent television in the 1950s. A statement from the ITC said the commission \"will consider the application from Channel Three News Ltd against the requirement of the Act to ensure that a nominated news provider is, or if appointed would be, effectively equipped and adequately financed.\" The ITC will comment on Thursday May 10 on whether Channel Three News is entitled to bid. ITN has dismissed the consortium, which was announced at the end of January, as a \"ragbag partnership crafted of desperation\". But the bid represents a major threat to ITN, which depends for its existence on the contract, which is worth around \u00a350m a year. Rupert Murdoch's Sky News has mounted a number of unsuccessful challenges to ITN's current terrestrial news monopoly, most recently with a bid for the contract to provide Channel 5 news. But it is thought unlikely that the increasingly consolidated ITV companies, who are shareholders in ITN, would award the contract to an outsider.

      "body": "<p>Thursday saw Josh and I leave New Zealand, which was definitely a pity because I had such a lovely time there. Our flight was at the crack of dawn - which reminds me, lots of countries like to charge you for the privilege of leaving their airport, so be prepared as you pass through into the departure lounge (I never have any money left at this point).</p> <p> I'd been planning to stay in a city hostel for a couple of nights when I arrived in Sydney to give me time to get myself together, but when I started phoning around I couldn't believe how expensive they were - especially since many of them were in very scummy locations. Eventually I plumped for a new hostel called Wanderers on Kent, and we fought our way through the rush hour traffic to get there. Fortunately, the hostel was worth the struggle - it was clean (including the showers!!) and new, the staff were friendly and the location was great! The only downside was that the rates were expensive, especially after New Zealand. </p> <p> Josh and I ambled around Sydney and I reacquainted myself with my one-time home - although I couldn't help feeling that it had lost some of its charm after the quiet beauty of South Island. Later that afternoon I had to see Josh off at the airport - inevitably very emotional - and then I was alone again. I wasn't too worried about that as I was going to start work again on Saturday and then I had just nine short days left before I would leave Sydney forever and travel up the coast. Using the last five months as a guide, I was certain the time would fly by.</p> <p> Later that night in my hostel I was desperate to go out somewhere - when I'm left alone the last thing I want to do is sit in a room. Unable to find anyone awake in the hostel, I headed to the bar next door where, after a short while, an Australian couple took me under their wing. I wound up having a very fun night that carried on into the small hours - and I got some good advice from the locals. I knew there were reasons why I loved Sydney. </p> <p> The next day, in an attempt to clear my head, I walked to Circular Quay and caught a ferry to Milson's Point, the site of the North Sydney Olympic Pool. I'd promised myself I'd get back in the water, and this seemed like a good way to start. The greatest thing about this pool is that if you just turn your head while you're swimming (either indoor or outdoor) you find yourself looking across the harbour towards the city with the bridge looming large in front of it. It very nearly distracted me from the actual swimming, although I felt so relaxed in the water that there may be hope for me yet! This was also to be my last night in the city - as it happened a bed was available at my old place, and budget-wise I would have been crazy not to move back in. </p> <p> My three hostel room-mates and I headed down towards the Rocks (the oldest area of Sydney) as one of them - an American girl - had yet to see the bridge and Opera House. After stopping for pizza at a small, crowded restaurant, we headed on to see Sydney's best-known sights. In the dark they are pretty spectacular and, though I didn't gawp as much as the others, I was reminded of how impressive the two structures are - especially the solid harbour bridge which dominates the skyline at so many points around the harbour. So Sydney is beautiful in its own way too. </p> <p> I had to drag myself out of bed at a silly time on Saturday for the pleasure of work. My hostel has a 24-hour reception and big storage lockers which is fantastic, as I could actually check out and leave my stuff at 4.30am. My day at work was actually pretty enjoyable - as I'd been away, I spent most of it recounting details of my trip to New Zealand and catching up with everybody. I also got invited to the house-warming of a couple of work-mates, so later that evening, after dragging my bag back to Coogee and pretty much just dumping it in my new room, I headed back out to Kirribilli, an attractive area on the opposite side of the harbour bridge. It was a fun evening, although I bet the two of them were relieved that they had yet to acquire any furniture! </p> <p> The disadvantage of going out with everybody you work with is that you all have to work the next day. That explains why on Sunday night there was a slightly ropy-looking group of us at the Jewish wedding reception. Actually I was quite keen to see it - I've heard they can be pretty lavish events and this turned out to be true. Such a lot of effort went into the evening: the ballroom looked like something out of a fairy tale, the guests wore some fantastic outfits and the whole thing seemed almost choreographed, especially the bride and groom's big entrance and their waltz together. </p> <p> Despite it being a fun evening I was shattered, and very much relieved to be let off early - and also given a hotel room key! I had to start work at 4am the next day and luckily there was a free room, so that evening I got to stay in five-star luxury. Unfortunately it defeated the point of sending me up early - I was so excited by the comfy bed, shower and robes, big TV and tea-maker that I stayed up using everything and had less than two hours' sleep. Still, those hours were in the cosiest bed I've ever been in - which made it very hard to leave! </p> <p> I made it through another long day and at the end of the shift it hit me - I've only got one more day of work after this, ever! I met this realisation with mixed emotions, but mostly with lots of anticipation for what the future holds. </p> <p> That night was Sapphire and Dave's last in Sydney before they head on to Melbourne and then New Zealand - like me, they've been brought round to the idea of going there because everyone talks about it so much. They were staying in the same place as me in Coogee although none of us had really been in to see each other, so that evening we had a quiet dinner celebration - actually, we stretched to a three-course meal, but as the extent of the actual cooking was switching on an oven, I won't describe it to you! </p> <p> On Tuesday I saw the two of them off for the last time until we meet England in September, and it then occurred to me that I had a day off. I was almost at a loose end - it's been such a long time since I've had a day to myself. Still, there are so many options around this city that I was really spoilt for choice. In the end I took the bus down to Bondi Junction - I hadn't been there for a while and the shops are good. I enjoyed a delicious sushi roll before purchasing the cookbook I'd been promising myself, then headed into the city simply to enjoy wandering around the ever-crowded streets. Later I cooked a beautiful vegetable stir-fry - well, OK, I cooked, which is achievement enough - and for once took it easy. Sometimes when I'm travelling I feel like I should be doing things all the time, but then I remind myself that it doesn't hurt to relax once in a while. Good for the soul. </p> <p> Besides, the next morning my alarm went off at 3am - and for once it wasn't for work. Wednesday April 25 is Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) Day, a public holiday, and I was off to the city to watch the dawn Anzac parade. I'd been advised by the locals to see this commemoration of the day in 1915 when Australians landed on the beach of Galipoli. It was the first calling of the newly-formed nation 'Australia' and although it was an unsuccessful manoeuvre, it kindled the spirit of 'mateship' and the slogan 'lest we forget'. At 4.30am a crowd of thousands stood in the dark near Martin's Place Cenotaph, listening to readings and joining in with the singing. It was a moving event, and one I was glad to be present for so I could understand the heritage of my adopted home. After the ceremony the crowd flocked to look at the Cenotaph which glowed gold in the early light and had been covered in flowers. There are just 24 veterans still living and later that morning, as taxis transported some of them at the front of a parade, the crowd cheered wildly.</p> <p> Because it was a public holiday I had the rest of the day to myself, and it was sizzling hot. My house-mates and I headed to the beach for a while, then, as one of them had a birthday, we bought a big picnic and joined several other friendly family groups in the sun at a beach-side park. It was an idyllic afternoon, full of good sun, good food and good drink. I slept very soundly that night. </p> <p> Until next week (end of work, end of Sydney - and no idea quite where I'm going next!), Milly.</p>",

There are just 24 veterans still living and later that morning, as taxis transported some of them at the front of a parade, the crowd cheered wildly. Because it was a public holiday I had the rest of the day to myself, and it was sizzling hot. My house-mates and I headed to the beach for a while, then, as one of them had a birthday, we bought a big picnic and joined several other friendly family groups in the sun at a beach-side park. It was an idyllic afternoon, full of good sun, good food and good drink. I slept very soundly that night. Until next week (end of work, end of Sydney - and no idea quite where I'm going next!), Milly.",

The recent opening of a bedazzling new multi-billion dollar airport in Seoul, where as many as 49 signs were subsequently discovered to have fallen prey to writers of Konglish, spoke \"volumes about the state of the translation and proofreading industry in Korea,\" the paper said. A few weeks previously, the vernacular newspaper <strong>Dong-a Ilbo</strong> had reported on a study conducted by Lee Ye Shik, a professor of English education at Kyungpook National University, that found hundreds of similar examples of Konglish in four first-year junior high school textbooks.</p> <p>\"Bad English in textbooks is particularly troubling because it helps reproduce the passivity towards good English that has permitted bad English to prosper in Korea for so long,\" the Herald concluded. \"If students are exposed to mistakes that many teachers will teach as good English, then how can English education in Korea improve?\"</p> <p>Perhaps it can do this by looking to the example of continental Europe. In a colourful piece published last week, the <strong>New York Times</strong> reported from Thalwil, in Switzerland, where English has become part of the daily routine in schools. Students as young as seven are learning multiplication or discussing the weather in English, and have even bypassed learning local German tunes in favour of \"Old MacDonald\" and \"How Are You This Morning?\" Parents are delighted, the article noted, but editorial writers elsewhere have demurred, asking why on earth, in a country with German, French, Italian and Romansch as national languages, children are should be learning English as their first foreign language. </p> <p>A shirty editorial published in the Geneva-based daily <strong>Le Matin</strong> attacked Zurich's education minister, Ernst Buschor, for threatening to tear the fabric of Switzerland's linguistically diverse state by extolling the example of a town like Thalwil. The newspaper said: \"He who has clearly learned little from his history lessons will go down in the history books as the gravedigger of the Swiss identity.\"</p> <p>The African press offers its younger nationals no such succour. Although news of the continent's bloodiest campus riots in nearly a decade led several of the region\u00cds newspapers this week, few reports contained words of solace or explanation. An estimated 2,500 Ethiopian students were arrested following protests that started at the University of Addis Ababa, leaving at least 41 people dead and more than 250 injured. The mayhem evoked memories of the student resistance to the military regime that ruled the nation from 1974 to 1991, although the cause of the latest violence was understood to have been students demanding a greater hand in their own university's affairs.</p> <p>A typical report, carried in Ethiopia's <strong>Daily Monitor</strong>, quoted an officer in charge of the crackdown saying that the arrests had occurred simply in order to allow police to sort out \"the hooligans from the students\". Another report quoted the police as saying that no more than 31 people had been killed -11 of them victims of stray bullets, 11 others under \"unknown circumstances\" and 11 more being \"hooligans with criminal records who were gunned down while looting or vandalising public and private property\". Elementary arithmetic, not truth, would appear to be the first casualty in any conflict in Ethiopia.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the region, an editorial published in the <strong>Al-Ahram Weekly</strong> in Egypt took aim at the mistreatment of scholars in Iran. It declared that the Islamic republic's periodic crackdowns on intellectuals have become as \"familiar to the public's ears as an increase in the price of milk or the vanishing of a favourite newspaper\". The mass arrest earlier this month of 42 dissidents, including a number of university administrators, \"was a sign to reformists that no threat to the system, however legal or mild, would be tolerated,\" it said.</p> <p>In a separate editorial commentary, the same newspaper weighed in on Morals, the latest discipline to be added to the Egyptian curriculum, which is intended to instruct school children in what officials describe as ethical behaviour, politeness and good conduct. \"This curious innovation,\" noted the paper, \"is due to concerns about the decline in morality among young people, as evidenced in widespread bullying, cheating, complete disregard for laws and regulations and the beating up of teachers.\" But will it achieve the slightest good? To the contrary, said Al-Ahram, it will \"be spoon-fed and memorised, regurgitated at exams then forgotten - without any gain in terms of morality, freedom or democracy.\"</p> <p>Kids, go easy on that driver. Just a day after San Jose school bus operator Cathline Repunte was arraigned on Wednesday on charges of murder and attempted murder, the <strong>Mercury News</strong> in San Francisco speculated on a likely motive for the shootings. In addition to the usual morning-after cliches with which writers tend to adorn such pieces, the paper also noted that the assailant was a loner, as well as being \"reclusive\" and \"angry\". The suspect was also revealed to be ... a stern disciplinarian.</p> <p>In the weeks before she allegedly opened fire, killing one and wounding three of her fellow school bus drivers, Ms Repunte and the students who rode the bus on her new route traded many unpleasantries. She had always been \"quick to tell her young passengers to quiet down,\" the paper revealed, \"going as far as filing a written complaint about their behaviour with her employer.\"</p> <p>No word, of course, on the vague possibility that the easy availability of handguns in the United States might have played the remotest part in this latest American school tragedy.</p>",

The newspaper said: \"He who has clearly learned little from his history lessons will go down in the history books as the gravedigger of the Swiss identity.\" The African press offers its younger nationals no such succour. Although news of the continent's bloodiest campus riots in nearly a decade led several of the region\u00cds newspapers this week, few reports contained words of solace or explanation. An estimated 2,500 Ethiopian students were arrested following protests that started at the University of Addis Ababa, leaving at least 41 people dead and more than 250 injured. The mayhem evoked memories of the student resistance to the military regime that ruled the nation from 1974 to 1991, although the cause of the latest violence was understood to have been students demanding a greater hand in their own university's affairs. A typical report, carried in Ethiopia's Daily Monitor, quoted an officer in charge of the crackdown saying that the arrests had occurred simply in order to allow police to sort out \"the hooligans from the students\". Another report quoted the police as saying that no more than 31 people had been killed -11 of them victims of stray bullets, 11 others under \"unknown circumstances\" and 11 more being \"hooligans with criminal records who were gunned down while looting or vandalising public and private property\". Elementary arithmetic, not truth, would appear to be the first casualty in any conflict in Ethiopia. Elsewhere in the region, an editorial published in the Al-Ahram Weekly in Egypt took aim at the mistreatment of scholars in Iran. It declared that the Islamic republic's periodic crackdowns on intellectuals have become as \"familiar to the public's ears as an increase in the price of milk or the vanishing of a favourite newspaper\". The mass arrest earlier this month of 42 dissidents, including a number of university administrators, \"was a sign to reformists that no threat to the system, however legal or mild, would be tolerated,\" it said. In a separate editorial commentary, the same newspaper weighed in on Morals, the latest discipline to be added to the Egyptian curriculum, which is intended to instruct school children in what officials describe as ethical behaviour, politeness and good conduct. \"This curious innovation,\" noted the paper, \"is due to concerns about the decline in morality among young people, as evidenced in widespread bullying, cheating, complete disregard for laws and regulations and the beating up of teachers.\" But will it achieve the slightest good? To the contrary, said Al-Ahram, it will \"be spoon-fed and memorised, regurgitated at exams then forgotten - without any gain in terms of morality, freedom or democracy.\" Kids, go easy on that driver. Just a day after San Jose school bus operator Cathline Repunte was arraigned on Wednesday on charges of murder and attempted murder, the Mercury News in San Francisco speculated on a likely motive for the shootings. In addition to the usual morning-after cliches with which writers tend to adorn such pieces, the paper also noted that the assailant was a loner, as well as being \"reclusive\" and \"angry\". The suspect was also revealed to be ... a stern disciplinarian. In the weeks before she allegedly opened fire, killing one and wounding three of her fellow school bus drivers, Ms Repunte and the students who rode the bus on her new route traded many unpleasantries. She had always been \"quick to tell her young passengers to quiet down,\" the paper revealed, \"going as far as filing a written complaint about their behaviour with her employer.\" No word, of course, on the vague possibility that the easy availability of handguns in the United States might have played the remotest part in this latest American school tragedy.",

There has been continuing concern over the safety of breast implants - particularly those filled with silicone - even though independent inquiries in the UK have given them a clean bill of health. A Commons select committee recently recommended that there should be a surveillance system to monitor the possible side-effects of breast implants. David Hinchliffe, the Labour MP for Wakefield and the chairman of the health select committee, said women should \"think very carefully\" before having surgery to increase the size of their breasts. About 8,000 women a year in Britain have breast enlargement surgery but some have had implants removed because of the controversies. \u0095 Several soldiers have had breast enlargement operations in a military hospital at ministry of defence expense, it was revealed yesterday. The operations were in the \"public interest\", the MoD insisted. \"They were not just a \"cosmetic or vanity thing\". The implants were only given to servicewomen who had developed a \"recurring and chronic psychological difficulty\" preventing them from being effective soldiers. Breast implants were approved only when there were clinical reasons and after counselling had failed, the MoD spokesman said. The cost of an operation, between \u00a32,000 and \u00a32,500, compared with the thousands of pounds training the women soldiers in the \"service of the country\", he said. \"We are not treating our servicewomen any differently than they would be treated as civilians by the NHS\", he added.

It won't happen this year - file season 2000/01 under \"yet another close call\" - but perhaps next time round will be a scrape too far.</p> <p>They're obviously preparing for their spectacular relegation a season early. By extracting the last traces of invention from their football, the Goodison \"giants\" have managed to lose five of their last six. Well done lads!</p> <p>Bradford, meanwhile, are in a rich vein of form. They've won their last two, were unlucky to lose at Tottenham, drew another couple and gave Ipswich a real fright for 60 minutes at Portman Road. What's more, they're scoring goals as well. With relegation inevitable and the pressure off, they haven't failed to find the net since February 10.</p> <p>And Everton are odds-on to beat them?</p> <p><strong>The Prince of Punts (aka Paul MacInnes): Leicester to beat Newcastle 10/3 @ \u00a35</strong></p> <p>The Prince once met Peter Taylor at a function. It was at the residency of the Kyrgyzstani ambassador, and rather pleasant it was too. Mr Taylor engaged the Prince for more than an hour on the subject of sports socks, and the importance in the modern game of starching them thoroughly. I took his words on board and have never forgotten them. Never made any use of them either, but that's one's luck.</p> <p>Anyhow, that evening with Mr Taylor came to mind when plumping for this week's punt. With such a thorough approach to the game, surely he couldn't lead his Leicester side to a club record eight league defeats on the trot? Taking on Newcastle is not the most difficult proposition in the Premiership, even at St James Park, and with both sides ravaged by injury it could go either way. Back against weak favourites said the sage, and so I will.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Burdett of the Guardian Unlimited Punters Collective: Manchester City v West Ham United, draw \u00a35 @ 12/5</strong></p> <p>So with that precious point at the so-called Theatre of Dreams last weekend, City awaken just in time to avoid the drop? Not likely. The hapless Hammers have been in one hell of a sulk since Spurs dumped them from the FA Cup, and if City could have chosen their opponents for such a vital game, Harry_s mob would certainly have been towards the top of the list. </p> <p>But even so, you have to worry about a side that blows between lukewarm and frosty with shocking regularity. More worryingly still, you truly fear for a side that relies so heavily on the predatory instincts of an arthritic Goat for its survival. Even a mildly-interested West Ham will be good enough for a point. Which is, of course, of no use to City at all.</p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle: Las Palmas v Real Sociedad: Real Sociedad to win \u00a37 @ 9/4</strong></p> <p>Las Palmas are huge favourites for this relegation six pointer (copyright tabloid journalists across the world), but I'm not sure why. On the surface their home record is decent (seven wins, three draws and five defeats) while Sociedad's away record is diabolical (three wins, three draws, nine losses). But pry a little deeper and different story emerges.</p> <p>Las Palmas' recent record is atrocious. In their last ten games in La Liga, Vinny Samways and his mates have won once, drawn twice and lost seven. Meanwhile another Brit, John Toshack, has inspired Sociedad to a five match unbeaten run (two wins and three draws). So a small wager on John's boys has got to be worth it, hasn't it?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Current totals (from their initial \u00a3100 kitties): Scott Murray = \u00a3148.04 The Prince of Punts (aka Paul MacInnes) = \u00a350.00 The Guardian Unlimited Punters Collective = \u00a328.46 Sean Ingle = \u00a318.32 Scott Murray: Bradford to win at Everton \u00a35 @ 7/2 Let's face it, the way things have been going, Everton are going to go down sooner rather than later. It won't happen this year - file season 2000/01 under \"yet another close call\" - but perhaps next time round will be a scrape too far. They're obviously preparing for their spectacular relegation a season early. By extracting the last traces of invention from their football, the Goodison \"giants\" have managed to lose five of their last six. Well done lads! Bradford, meanwhile, are in a rich vein of form. They've won their last two, were unlucky to lose at Tottenham, drew another couple and gave Ipswich a real fright for 60 minutes at Portman Road. What's more, they're scoring goals as well. With relegation inevitable and the pressure off, they haven't failed to find the net since February 10. And Everton are odds-on to beat them? The Prince of Punts (aka Paul MacInnes): Leicester to beat Newcastle 10/3 @ \u00a35 The Prince once met Peter Taylor at a function. It was at the residency of the Kyrgyzstani ambassador, and rather pleasant it was too. Mr Taylor engaged the Prince for more than an hour on the subject of sports socks, and the importance in the modern game of starching them thoroughly. I took his words on board and have never forgotten them. Never made any use of them either, but that's one's luck. Anyhow, that evening with Mr Taylor came to mind when plumping for this week's punt. With such a thorough approach to the game, surely he couldn't lead his Leicester side to a club record eight league defeats on the trot? Taking on Newcastle is not the most difficult proposition in the Premiership, even at St James Park, and with both sides ravaged by injury it could go either way. Back against weak favourites said the sage, and so I will. Sarah Burdett of the Guardian Unlimited Punters Collective: Manchester City v West Ham United, draw \u00a35 @ 12/5 So with that precious point at the so-called Theatre of Dreams last weekend, City awaken just in time to avoid the drop? Not likely. The hapless Hammers have been in one hell of a sulk since Spurs dumped them from the FA Cup, and if City could have chosen their opponents for such a vital game, Harry_s mob would certainly have been towards the top of the list. But even so, you have to worry about a side that blows between lukewarm and frosty with shocking regularity. More worryingly still, you truly fear for a side that relies so heavily on the predatory instincts of an arthritic Goat for its survival. Even a mildly-interested West Ham will be good enough for a point. Which is, of course, of no use to City at all. Sean Ingle: Las Palmas v Real Sociedad: Real Sociedad to win \u00a37 @ 9/4 Las Palmas are huge favourites for this relegation six pointer (copyright tabloid journalists across the world), but I'm not sure why. On the surface their home record is decent (seven wins, three draws and five defeats) while Sociedad's away record is diabolical (three wins, three draws, nine losses). But pry a little deeper and different story emerges. Las Palmas' recent record is atrocious. In their last ten games in La Liga, Vinny Samways and his mates have won once, drawn twice and lost seven. Meanwhile another Brit, John Toshack, has inspired Sociedad to a five match unbeaten run (two wins and three draws). So a small wager on John's boys has got to be worth it, hasn't it?",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's personal think tank has told him to increase inheritance and income tax, as well as increase selection in state schools if he is achieve his vision of a genuine meritocratic society in Britain. The report suggests wealthy parents are buying access to good state schools by being able to afford the higher house prices in the school's local catchment area. \"Significant policy interventions\" would be needed to overcome the barriers to social mobility, including the barriers to downward mobility, it says. It even suggests it might be necessary - on the basis of US studies - to spend as at least 10 times as much on the education of each black child as on each white child to equalise their future wage earnings. The stark analysis comes from the Performance and Innovation Unit - the Cabinet Office think tank used by Mr Blair to tackle controversial political issues. The findings, published yesterday, are bound to be attacked by the Conservatives as Labour's hidden agenda. But they are also likely to be seen as a sober warning to Mr Blair either to moderate his rhetoric about achieving a meritocracy, or think through its tough consequences for what the paper describes as \"the dull middle class\". The prime minister told the Labour conference in 1999 that he wanted to create a meritocratic rather than egalitarian society. The report is the product of a seminar involving some of Whitehall's leading thinkers, including key figures from the Downing Street policy unit and Anthony Giddens, the \"third way\" thinker. It argues that earnings mobility has stalled in Britain, and suggests that deindustrialisation may have been the single biggest cause. Ethnic minorites, it says, have suffered most. In the past 20 years income inequalities have widened significantly, Mr Blair's think tank states. \"Between 1979 and 1998-99, the real incomes of the bottom decile of the income distribution rose by 6% in real terms whereas the real incomes of those in the top 10% rose by 82%. Mean income rose by 55%\". While \"more room at the top\" - due to economic growth - has allowed more of the poor to rise up the social ladder, the report finds no evidence that the middle class have been at any greater risk of a fall in social status. The PIU finds that middle class people buy the best education either through private schools or by moving near to the best state schools. The report says \"the higher levels of education attainment mean that private schools nowadays offer access to good universities through academic qualifications rather than through contacts or old boy networks\". A true meritocratic society must include high rates of social mobility and the absence of any association between class origins and equality of opportunity, the report maintains. It also shows that when the poor do move out of poverty it is not very far or for very long. Of those in the bottom two deciles in 1991, less than one in four was in top 60% of the income distribution in 1998. Drawing on government research, the report suggests that there has also been an overall decline in earnings mobility in the two decades between 1977 and 1997, particularly among prime age men. Earnings progression for women seems to have improved. It also shows that 40% to 50% of employees who start in the lowest quarter of earnings distribution are still there after six years in employment. The analysis is not likely to be particularly palatable in poitical terms to the Labour leadership, which claimed yesterday that it could largely break the cycle of inequality through implementing its radical ideas for allocating incremental assets through the stages of childhood. The report says it is a matter for politicians to decide how far they wish to push the mobilty agenda. If the government wants mobility to be strong and widespread - downward, as well as upward mobility - it will have to chose strong options, including some quite dramatic tax measures. The report suggests that the strongest option might have disadvantages, including the creation of more \"losers, social tension and the possibility that winners could scoop all the rewards\".

Recognising that passions may soon be running high, Mr Prescott repeated this week that UK funding must be addressed sooner rather than later. Sensibly, he suggested it should be done alongside a forthcoming review of Whitehall's equally complex system for determining how grants are shared among town and county halls - based on a formula, known as the standard spending assessment (SSA).

That, of course, does not answer the wider UK funding question. On the latest figures the north-east would need an extra \u00a31.1bn a year to catch up with Scottish spending, while Yorkshire - with a similar population to Scotland - would need \u00a35.2bn more and the south-east \u00a312.1bn.</p> <p>While it is tempting to look north of the border and argue for a redistribution of resources from Scotland to England, the Scots can justly claim that serving a generally sparsely populated country of many diverse regions and three large island groups, with a population concentrated in the Clyde-Forth central belt, does not come cheap.

      "body": "<p><strong> Destiny's Child</strong> Survivor<br> (Columbia) **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Anyone searching for a cautionary tale about pop stardom's perils could do worse than read Mary Wilson's biography. Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme reveals that spending the 1960s standing behind Diana Ross, occasionally cooing a mellifluous \"oooh\", was not the bed of roses one might imagine. The sequins and smiles apparently hid a life of tantrums, manipulation and shady business deals, all dictated by the ruthless personal ambition of their leader. The book has two simple messages: that Diana Ross was Richard III in false eyelashes, and that being a member of the biggest girl band in the world is no fun at all. </p> <p>Destiny's Child are currently the biggest girl band in the world. Their clever twist on R&amp;B - dramatic, staccato rhythms topped with man-bashing, money-obsessed lyrics, like girl power with a working knowledge of bulls and bears - has sold 19m albums worldwide. But recently all has not been well with the Houston trio. Last January, two members of the band were summarily sacked. They are currently suing the band's manager, Martin Knowles - father of lead singer Beyonce - alleging rampant nepotism and irregular business practices. One of their teenage replacements further sullied the sisterly image by lasting only five months before bizarrely claiming she was leaving Destiny's Child owing to \"dehydration\". </p> <p>Whatever has been going on behind the perfectly manicured facade has allowed Beyonce Knowles to emergence as the band's sole driving force. In contrast to the band's two previous albums, Knowles co-writes, produces and arranges every one of Survivor's 18 tracks. The result is indulgent in every sense. At well over an hour, Survivor is much too long. Four minutes are given over to a self-regarding spoken-word piece that essentially consists of Destiny's Child congratulating each other for completing the album and, as is the way with R&amp;B groups, thanking God. Who in their right mind wants to listen to this? Almost as superfluous is an interminable a capella gospel medley, the sort of thing most artists would use to pad out their live set but would never consider recording for posterity. </p> <p>Lyrically, much of Survivor sounds less like a rallying cry for emancipated sisterhood than a prolonged and rather vindictive attack on the band's ousted members. \"Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better,\" snaps Knowles on the title track. \"Thought I wouldn't sell without you, I sold nine million,\" she adds, lest anyone think the song is about a former lover. </p> <p>As mealy-mouthed and mean-minded as Survivor is, it's hard not to be frequently beguiled by the music. The lyrical tongue-poking may betray her immaturity, but at 20 years old Knowles is already remarkably assured behind the mixing desk. She has learned her tricks from former Destiny's Child collaborators Rodney Jerkins, Sheke'spere and Timbaland. They are visionary producers who have transformed R&amp;B from a cliche-ridden, ballad-led genre - the favoured sedution soundtrack of the suburban teen lothario - into perhaps the most exciting and ground-breaking music on the planet. </p> <p>Knowles has inherited their ability to deftly mix commercial hooks with avant-garde studio experimentation. Sexy Daddy bristles with discordant harmonies and thundering ragga rhythms, while Fancy is driven by pizzicato strings and unexpected, lurching key changes. A scattered and abstract re-recording of the recent number one, Independent Women, finds Destiny's Child singing over the sort of music that usually accompanies characters sneaking about in Czech cartoons. </p> <p>Survivor matches its lyrical ire with tough, thrilling music. The European pop clogging up the British charts is regulated and uniform - the anaemic end result of factory-line songwriting and production techniques - but this is pop that draws in the listener by surprising them. Its selling point is its difference from its competitors, rather than its similarity. </p> <p>The album loses its way when the tempo slows. A trio of identikit ballads, bafflingly placed together, hark back to an era when R&amp;B divas existed solely on a diet of gloopy saccharine. Overwrought with showy vocal flourishes, My Heart Still Beats could be the work of Celine Dion, and it sits uncomfortably alongside tracks such as Bootylicious, which comes complete with startling, hiccuping vocals and wittily samples Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks, herself no stranger to inter-band ructions and upheaval. </p> <p>Those ructions, and Knowles's petulant musical response, may yet see Destiny's Child the subject of a Dreamgirls-style muck-raking. The combination of glittering success, vast wealth, disgruntled former members, a shadowy manager and the alleged megalomania of their leader is almost too salacious to resist. </p> <p>But it would be a shame if Destiny's Child became better known as a kind of singing soap opera than a genuinely vital musical force. In all its flawed, arrogant pomp, Survivor has a rare individuality, and a hint of genius, hidden in its grooves.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Destiny's Child Survivor (Columbia) **** \u00a314.99 Anyone searching for a cautionary tale about pop stardom's perils could do worse than read Mary Wilson's biography. Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme reveals that spending the 1960s standing behind Diana Ross, occasionally cooing a mellifluous \"oooh\", was not the bed of roses one might imagine. The sequins and smiles apparently hid a life of tantrums, manipulation and shady business deals, all dictated by the ruthless personal ambition of their leader. The book has two simple messages: that Diana Ross was Richard III in false eyelashes, and that being a member of the biggest girl band in the world is no fun at all. Destiny's Child are currently the biggest girl band in the world. Their clever twist on R&amp;B - dramatic, staccato rhythms topped with man-bashing, money-obsessed lyrics, like girl power with a working knowledge of bulls and bears - has sold 19m albums worldwide. But recently all has not been well with the Houston trio. Last January, two members of the band were summarily sacked. They are currently suing the band's manager, Martin Knowles - father of lead singer Beyonce - alleging rampant nepotism and irregular business practices. One of their teenage replacements further sullied the sisterly image by lasting only five months before bizarrely claiming she was leaving Destiny's Child owing to \"dehydration\". Whatever has been going on behind the perfectly manicured facade has allowed Beyonce Knowles to emergence as the band's sole driving force. In contrast to the band's two previous albums, Knowles co-writes, produces and arranges every one of Survivor's 18 tracks. The result is indulgent in every sense. At well over an hour, Survivor is much too long. Four minutes are given over to a self-regarding spoken-word piece that essentially consists of Destiny's Child congratulating each other for completing the album and, as is the way with R&amp;B groups, thanking God. Who in their right mind wants to listen to this? Almost as superfluous is an interminable a capella gospel medley, the sort of thing most artists would use to pad out their live set but would never consider recording for posterity. Lyrically, much of Survivor sounds less like a rallying cry for emancipated sisterhood than a prolonged and rather vindictive attack on the band's ousted members. \"Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better,\" snaps Knowles on the title track. \"Thought I wouldn't sell without you, I sold nine million,\" she adds, lest anyone think the song is about a former lover. As mealy-mouthed and mean-minded as Survivor is, it's hard not to be frequently beguiled by the music. The lyrical tongue-poking may betray her immaturity, but at 20 years old Knowles is already remarkably assured behind the mixing desk. She has learned her tricks from former Destiny's Child collaborators Rodney Jerkins, Sheke'spere and Timbaland. They are visionary producers who have transformed R&amp;B from a cliche-ridden, ballad-led genre - the favoured sedution soundtrack of the suburban teen lothario - into perhaps the most exciting and ground-breaking music on the planet. Knowles has inherited their ability to deftly mix commercial hooks with avant-garde studio experimentation. Sexy Daddy bristles with discordant harmonies and thundering ragga rhythms, while Fancy is driven by pizzicato strings and unexpected, lurching key changes. A scattered and abstract re-recording of the recent number one, Independent Women, finds Destiny's Child singing over the sort of music that usually accompanies characters sneaking about in Czech cartoons. Survivor matches its lyrical ire with tough, thrilling music. The European pop clogging up the British charts is regulated and uniform - the anaemic end result of factory-line songwriting and production techniques - but this is pop that draws in the listener by surprising them. Its selling point is its difference from its competitors, rather than its similarity. The album loses its way when the tempo slows. A trio of identikit ballads, bafflingly placed together, hark back to an era when R&amp;B divas existed solely on a diet of gloopy saccharine. Overwrought with showy vocal flourishes, My Heart Still Beats could be the work of Celine Dion, and it sits uncomfortably alongside tracks such as Bootylicious, which comes complete with startling, hiccuping vocals and wittily samples Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks, herself no stranger to inter-band ructions and upheaval. Those ructions, and Knowles's petulant musical response, may yet see Destiny's Child the subject of a Dreamgirls-style muck-raking. The combination of glittering success, vast wealth, disgruntled former members, a shadowy manager and the alleged megalomania of their leader is almost too salacious to resist. But it would be a shame if Destiny's Child became better known as a kind of singing soap opera than a genuinely vital musical force. In all its flawed, arrogant pomp, Survivor has a rare individuality, and a hint of genius, hidden in its grooves.",

He is laying down the gauntlet to Mr Hague,\" Lord Taylor said.</p> <p>\"The leader of the Conservative party prides himself on his judo and 14 pints-a-day macho image. Now is Mr Hague's chance to demonstrate real macho leadership by withdrawing the whip from Mr Townend and booting him out of the party.\"</p> <p>The row re-erupted on Thursday after the Mr Townend wrote to the Commission for Racial Equality denouncing the idea of a \"multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual society\" and accusing Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of portraying the British as a \"mongrel race\".</p> <p>Despite the outcry his comments caused, a defiant Mr Townend insisted that he had no intention of withdrawing them.</p> <p>He accused the CRE of trying to stifle debate on immigration through its compact, urging politicians to avoid racist language during the forthcoming election campaign.</p> <p>\"Now this is an important issue at this election and I think this pact was aimed to stop discussion, and anybody like me who puts their head above the parapet is accused of being a racist,\" he told the BBC radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>\"Once you divide people up into groups, you have got problems, and then of course you have resentment from the indigenous population who feel that their interests are not being served.\"</p> <p>Mr Townend said that \"enormous numbers\" of illegal immigrants were coming into the country.</p> <p>\"We are catching them at a rate of a 100,000 a year, there is probably another 100,000 a year which are getting through without being caught. \"This is an important issue at this election and I think this pact was aimed to stop discussion, and anybody like me who puts their head above the parapet is accused of being a racist.</p> <p>Mr Townend said he did not believe there was a big difference between his views and those of Mr Hague.</p> <p>\"I think William Hague wants an inclusive society and I'm sure that he would like us to have a colour-blind society.\"</p> <p>This morning on the Today programme, Stephen Dorrell, the Tory MP for Charnwood and a former cabinet minister, also took issue with Mr Townend's approach but stopped short of calling for him to have the whip withdrawn. \"He is wrong when he says it is not possible to have more than one cultural background,\" he said.</p> <p>\"He uses the example of the United States.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party leader, William Hague, was jostled and abused today by protesters sporting masks today on a visit to Pudsey in Yorkshire. Three people asked Mr Hague if he was planning to sack John Townend, the Conservative MP for Yorkshire East, for his inflammatory comments about race. And when Mr Hague stopped at a market to buy flowers for his wife, one of the protesters, who were all wearing Hague face masks, shouted: \"Are those for Mr Townend?\" Mr Hague replied: \"They are most definitely for my wife Ffion.\" Mr Hague has come under increasing pressure form within his own party to expel Mr Townend after the Tory MP's continued attacks on asylum seekers. Lord Taylor of Warwick, the black Conservative peer, called on Mr Hague to withdraw the whip from Mr Townend after he re-ignited the controversy by accusing ministers of wanting to turn the British into a \"mongrel race\". \"John Townend is clearly determined to continue spouting his racist rubbish. He is laying down the gauntlet to Mr Hague,\" Lord Taylor said. \"The leader of the Conservative party prides himself on his judo and 14 pints-a-day macho image. Now is Mr Hague's chance to demonstrate real macho leadership by withdrawing the whip from Mr Townend and booting him out of the party.\" The row re-erupted on Thursday after the Mr Townend wrote to the Commission for Racial Equality denouncing the idea of a \"multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual society\" and accusing Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of portraying the British as a \"mongrel race\". Despite the outcry his comments caused, a defiant Mr Townend insisted that he had no intention of withdrawing them. He accused the CRE of trying to stifle debate on immigration through its compact, urging politicians to avoid racist language during the forthcoming election campaign. \"Now this is an important issue at this election and I think this pact was aimed to stop discussion, and anybody like me who puts their head above the parapet is accused of being a racist,\" he told the BBC radio 4's Today programme. \"Once you divide people up into groups, you have got problems, and then of course you have resentment from the indigenous population who feel that their interests are not being served.\" Mr Townend said that \"enormous numbers\" of illegal immigrants were coming into the country. \"We are catching them at a rate of a 100,000 a year, there is probably another 100,000 a year which are getting through without being caught. \"This is an important issue at this election and I think this pact was aimed to stop discussion, and anybody like me who puts their head above the parapet is accused of being a racist. Mr Townend said he did not believe there was a big difference between his views and those of Mr Hague. \"I think William Hague wants an inclusive society and I'm sure that he would like us to have a colour-blind society.\" This morning on the Today programme, Stephen Dorrell, the Tory MP for Charnwood and a former cabinet minister, also took issue with Mr Townend's approach but stopped short of calling for him to have the whip withdrawn. \"He is wrong when he says it is not possible to have more than one cultural background,\" he said. \"He uses the example of the United States. The Americans have been extremely successful at integrating people from a wide number of different parts of the world, but the phrase Spanish-American, Polish-American, German-American, anybody who knows anything about the social background of the United States, knows that there are different communities within the United States. \"We ourselves have always been an open country and have taken people from a wide variety of different parts of the world, that is part of what it means to be English or to be British.\" Asked what should be done about people like Mr Townend from the point of view of party discipline, Mr Dorrell did not, however, support his expulsion. \"This is a free country and people are entitled to express their views. But what a party is entitled to do is to distinguish its collective view from those of its members that it disagrees with. The Conservative Party does not agree with Mr Townend.\" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes also strongly criticised Mr Townend's latest remarks. Mr Hughes said: \"John Townend is very wrong in principle in suggesting that it (multiculturalism) is undermining something we have always had, some pure Englishness - very few people are pure English over many generations.\" Although Mr Hague has repudiated Mr Townend's remarks, he has said that he was not going to expel Mr Townend as he was standing down anyway as MP for Yorkshire East at the general election.

Research showed that black and Asian people in Britain were now twice as likely to be unemployed as their white counterparts. As race issues today featured prominently in the headlines, with the Tory MP John Townend controversially calling Britain a \"mongrel race\", figures showed black and Asian jobless rates stand at 12% - one of the highest on record - compared with 5% among white people. In some regions the unemployment rate among black and Asian people was even higher, including 15% in Yorkshire and Humberside and the West Midlands. Even when they found work, black and Asian people faced discrimination when they tried to get a managerial post, said the TUC. The union organisation said the position was worse than in 1990, when black and Asian unemployment was 11%. The government was urged to extend the Race Relations Act to give private and voluntary sector employers the same legal obligations as those imposed on public authorities. However, the research does show that the proportion of black and Asian workers educated to degree level or above increased from 21% to 26% over the last 18 months.

Jurors had watched security film taken at the police station, showing Mr Alder face down on the floor in handcuffs, with his trousers down. The inquest heard that the officers - custody sergeant John Dunn and PCs Matthew Barr, Neil Blakey, Nigel Dawson and Mark Ellerington - thought Mr Alder was play-acting. Their attempt to overturn the verdict failed at the high court in London last month. Mr Justice Jackson rejected their claim that a relationship between a barrister and a woman juror after the inquest had \"raised a real danger of bias\". The crown prosecution service said that the five would still be facing serious charges, probably later this year. Stuart Richardson of the Police Federation in Hull said that the officers were pleased with the decision and had always denied the charge of neglect.",

      "body": "<p>As Israelis struggled with the day-after blues following Independence Day celebrations, there was one compelling topic of conversation on Friday: the monumental traffic queues as people headed in droves for the beaches and the parks to celebrate their national holiday.</p> <p>Thousands of people were halted for hours at a stretch; it took some motorists more than an hour simply to negotiate the last traffic light out of Jerusalem.</p> <p>Amid the chaos, Israelis got a rare glimpse of the frustrations Palestinians encounter on a daily basis. In the desert city of Jericho, canny motorists leave at least an extra hour to clear the roadblocks that now encircle the town.</p> <p>After the israeli army dug an 18-kilometre trench through the desert sands to seal off the town completely, there is only one road in or out of the city. It is guarded by an Israeli army camp that has increased steadily in size during the course of the seven-month uprising, and vehicles now pass an obstacle course of concrete barricades, presided over by an Israeli soldier who motions them forward, one car at a time, with a flick of his wrist.</p> <p>\"It is better not to go anywhere just to sit at home,\" said Wajiha, a secretary who says she has not set foot outside Jericho for more than three months.</p> <p>A few days ago, there were widespread reports that the walls of Jericho were about to come tumbling down, a reward for a series of meetings by Palestinian and Israeli security officials which have seen a drop in shooting attacks on Jewish settlements and troops.</p> <p>For Israeli gamblers, there was an additional frisson in the announcement on Israel Radio. There is a glitzy casino on the edges of town - banned to Palestinians to appease conservatives who frown on gambling, but a magnet for punters from all over Israel, who arrived by the busload before the intifada.</p> <p>Until last September, the casino, reputedly controlled by cronies of Yasser Arafat, was the biggest money spinner for the Palestinian Authority. It remained open during the early days of the uprising, and a few die-hard gamblers broke the law on travel for Israeli citizens to Palestinian towns to get their fix. But after it was repeatedly shelled by Israeli soldiers, the casino closed down for repairs.</p> <p>Alas for the gamblers - and the casino's mysterious consortium of owners - hopes that Jericho would soon be open to the public were scotched by the hardline Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who overruled the promises of his Nobel laureate foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to ease the siege on the city.</p> <p>\"In the Jericho area, 700 million dollars was invested in different industries... this plus the tourism. Everything has been paralysed,\" Mr Peres had told Israel radio. \"Our position is to allow for a normal lifestyle unconditionally and without receiving anything in return. We don't want to harm innocent people.\"</p> <p>And so the media began to report on the re-opening of Jericho as a fact. But instead, new concrete barriers arrived to fortify the Israeli checkpoint, and last week Israeli armoured bulldozers razed dozens of acres of vinyards, and destroyed a farmer's home, allegedly for security reasons.</p> <p>For Palestinians, the reports were infuriating - largely because the siege of Jericho has worsened, not eased, during the last few days as Israel imposes it regular ban on entry to the Jewish state from the West Bank and Gaza as part of the security measures for Independence Day.</p> <p>Palestinians argue that such announcements by Israel are meant to obscure the situation on the ground in the West Bank, and cover up the immediate hardship, and long-term damage, inflicted by the siege.</p> <p>\"Jericho is the only town that has a new rule now that nobody can leave without having a female sitting next to the driver, and Jericho is the only town in the West Bank that has a trench around it,\" said Saeb Erakat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, who lives in the town.</p> <p>\"Why do they do it? Simply because of the farmers. Jericho is the breadbasket of the West Bank.

      "bodyText": "As Israelis struggled with the day-after blues following Independence Day celebrations, there was one compelling topic of conversation on Friday: the monumental traffic queues as people headed in droves for the beaches and the parks to celebrate their national holiday. Thousands of people were halted for hours at a stretch; it took some motorists more than an hour simply to negotiate the last traffic light out of Jerusalem. Amid the chaos, Israelis got a rare glimpse of the frustrations Palestinians encounter on a daily basis. In the desert city of Jericho, canny motorists leave at least an extra hour to clear the roadblocks that now encircle the town. After the israeli army dug an 18-kilometre trench through the desert sands to seal off the town completely, there is only one road in or out of the city. It is guarded by an Israeli army camp that has increased steadily in size during the course of the seven-month uprising, and vehicles now pass an obstacle course of concrete barricades, presided over by an Israeli soldier who motions them forward, one car at a time, with a flick of his wrist. \"It is better not to go anywhere just to sit at home,\" said Wajiha, a secretary who says she has not set foot outside Jericho for more than three months. A few days ago, there were widespread reports that the walls of Jericho were about to come tumbling down, a reward for a series of meetings by Palestinian and Israeli security officials which have seen a drop in shooting attacks on Jewish settlements and troops. For Israeli gamblers, there was an additional frisson in the announcement on Israel Radio. There is a glitzy casino on the edges of town - banned to Palestinians to appease conservatives who frown on gambling, but a magnet for punters from all over Israel, who arrived by the busload before the intifada. Until last September, the casino, reputedly controlled by cronies of Yasser Arafat, was the biggest money spinner for the Palestinian Authority. It remained open during the early days of the uprising, and a few die-hard gamblers broke the law on travel for Israeli citizens to Palestinian towns to get their fix. But after it was repeatedly shelled by Israeli soldiers, the casino closed down for repairs. Alas for the gamblers - and the casino's mysterious consortium of owners - hopes that Jericho would soon be open to the public were scotched by the hardline Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who overruled the promises of his Nobel laureate foreign minister, Shimon Peres, to ease the siege on the city. \"In the Jericho area, 700 million dollars was invested in different industries... this plus the tourism. Everything has been paralysed,\" Mr Peres had told Israel radio. \"Our position is to allow for a normal lifestyle unconditionally and without receiving anything in return. We don't want to harm innocent people.\" And so the media began to report on the re-opening of Jericho as a fact. But instead, new concrete barriers arrived to fortify the Israeli checkpoint, and last week Israeli armoured bulldozers razed dozens of acres of vinyards, and destroyed a farmer's home, allegedly for security reasons. For Palestinians, the reports were infuriating - largely because the siege of Jericho has worsened, not eased, during the last few days as Israel imposes it regular ban on entry to the Jewish state from the West Bank and Gaza as part of the security measures for Independence Day. Palestinians argue that such announcements by Israel are meant to obscure the situation on the ground in the West Bank, and cover up the immediate hardship, and long-term damage, inflicted by the siege. \"Jericho is the only town that has a new rule now that nobody can leave without having a female sitting next to the driver, and Jericho is the only town in the West Bank that has a trench around it,\" said Saeb Erakat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, who lives in the town. \"Why do they do it? Simply because of the farmers. Jericho is the breadbasket of the West Bank. Farmers market their produce in Ramallah, Hebron, and Nablus, so by making the trench they ensure that not even smuggling will be done. So that means farmers will find it cheaper not to plant, not to grow, not to harvest. So that is the destruction of the agricultural sector in this region.\" Related special reports Israel and the Middle East Other articles More articles by Suzanne Goldenberg Useful links Government of Israel Palestinian National Authority Ehud Barak's office Yasser Arafat's office Jerusalem Post Ha'aretz Jerusalem Report US Secretary of State's office Hamas Egyptian presidency",

This morning we awoke to find Arsenal, Leeds and the ubiquitous Tottenham Hotspur locked in a race to sign the player after reports claimed he had handed in a transfer request at Sunderland because his pregnant wife wanted to bring up baby in the south of England. Why Leeds were bothering, then, we don't know.</p> <p>It soon became clear, however, that Arsenal and Spurs were wasting their time as well. Peter Reid, who had obviously been worrying his pretty little head about the matter all morning, hauled Phillips into his office the moment he turned up for training, and within minutes was outside telling the world to sod off. \"I've had the boy in and it's rubbish,\" he growled. \"Kevin told me that we have such a good relationship that I would never hear anything about him first from a national newspaper,\" he continued, getting worryingly possessive. \"Kevin rubbished the story and told me he is very happy at the club.\"</p> <p>But with Phillips getting a hard time from the Sunderland faithful because he hasn't recently been propping up the rest of the team as usual, doubts lingered that the 27-year-old was tiring of his time on Wearside. Until, that is, Phillips emerged this afternoon to deliver the mother of all equivocal denials. \"Some of the stuff I read about myself sometimes is unbelievable and that includes this nonsense about me wanting to leave,\" began Old Mrs Equivocal Denial. \"I'm getting fed up with the tales going around that I'm unsettled, that my head's gone down, that I want to be away or whatever.

Cue lots of cheesy grins and banal comments like \"it's fantastic\" and \"it's a dream come true\". Well, yes. But also, the Fiver is pleased to report, no. Because anyone who tells reporters licking their booze-coated lips at the prospect of a saccharine-sweet I've-always-loved-United-me-even-when-they-were-relegated-in-1992 anecdote \"I wasn't a little boy who had United posters on the wall\" is alright by us.</p> <p>And he's obviously all right with Fergie too. \"His pace his good, his understanding of the game is good and he scores, which is very important for a striker,\" explained the Imperial Lord, offering a rare but illuminating insight into why he's such a great manager. But the praise didn't end there, because Fergie then went on to pay van Nistelrooy the greatest of compliments - comparing him to Dion Dublin. \"It is good when you see strikers scoring a variety of goals,\" he said of van the man. \"A few years ago someone sent me a video of Dion Dublin, I was really surprised at the variety of goals he scored. That is why we signed him.\"</p> <p>And the knockabout frivolities of the press conference continued, with Lord Ferg revealing that United could have signed van Nistelrooy two years ago for about \u00a34.5m! \"My son was at Heerenveen on trial for a few days. He came back and said: 'You have got to sign this lad van Nistelrooy, he's fantastic, sign him right away,'\" explained Ferg. \"I said: 'Hold on a minute, we have watched him already'. My son said: 'Just sign him'. That Saturday, we sent someone to the game but PSV were there and signed him the next day. Talk about slow! I shouldn't admit that, nevertheless he is here and that's what's important.\" Exactly.

      "bodyText": "Local government minister Hilary Armstrong has called on her colleagues to check the massive increase in Westminster's control of council spending since Labour came to power. The government has presided over a major rise in so-called \"ring fencing\", which forces councils to spend large parts of their budgets on ministerial priorities, such as improving school standards. But councils argue that this process eats into their freedom to spend money on the varying needs of local people, and so erodes the importance of local democracy. Among the options Ms Armstrong wants to use to limit the government's control of council budgets is an overall cap on the amount of money ministers can earmark in this way. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, would announce the limit as part of the next comprehensive spending review in a bid to stop departments slowly upping the amount of council spending they dictate from Whitehall. The Local Government Association today welcomed the proposal. A spokesman said: \"We've opposed the extension of ring fencing, so we'd support this stance. The amount of ring fencing has doubled in the past four years, so it's not surprising that some ministers want to rein it back in.\" The Treasury is thought likely to line up with Ms Armstrong against Mr Blunkett and the health secretary, Alan Milburn, both of whom are known for jealously guarding their departmental budgets. The value of ring-fenced money has doubled since Labour came to power - with specific grants growing from \u00a31.6bn in 1997-98 to more than \u00a34bn in the current financial year. That represents almost 10% of the total amount of government funding paid out to councils every year. Mr Milburn has already signalled a reduction in ring fencing within the NHS as part of a major package of reforms the service announced earlier this week. Ministers are also considering changes to the massive schools standards fund, which councils pass on to head teachers in order to pay for schemes chosen by the government. The fund is worth more than \u00a31.5bn, but local government must add in match funding of around \u00a3754m a year if it wants the full benefit, effectively earmarking another large chunk of council budgets for central priorities. Plans to drop this requirement may form part of the local government finance white paper, expected shortly after the next general election.",

To anyone under 25, \"casual\" may conjure images of sloppy Sunday sweatshirts.

This elite clique was less interested in duffing up the opposition than out-dressing them. It was all about appropriation. Working-class kids took on traditionally upper-class sports and outdoorsy brands - from Pringle to Lyle &amp; Scott, Barbour to Burberry - and recontextualised them in the dress codes of The Kop. </p> <p>\"Casuals were a huge influence on the 80s/90s label boom. It made a desire for premium brands the norm,\" says Robert Wade Smith, head of Liverpool's Wade Smith stores, one of the key players behind the recent resurgence of casuals. \"It had an anti-establishment element and was stylistically flamboyant: baby-cord trousers with a Norfolk jacket and deerstalker hat. That sense of British and Italian style, urban crossed with country, is very prevalent now.\" </p> <p>Casual style has reached the catwalk, informing recent shows from the likes of Raf Simons, Ralph Lauren and Prada. On the street, it overshadows the dominant look of working-class youth: razor haircuts, polo shirts with the collar up, tracksuit bottoms, white socks and Reebok Classics. </p> <p>Classic casual labels have been reborn: Lacoste, Fred Perry and Pringle, in all its diamond-fronted, celebrity golf circuit glory. Burberry continues to top the fashion league, while the Urban Outfitters chain recently found a job lot of original Tacchini which sold out almost immediately. And to top it all, Will Smith is calling Sergio Tacchini direct because he can't get hold of a certain track-top once worn by its then sponsored player, John McEnroe. Good job the company is reissuing a special edition, made to the original specifications, on the original machinery. </p> <p>\"The casual look is set to explode,\" says Martin Makin, Mancunian head of design at Sergio Tacchini and part of the Makin family which fed the casual scene by importing Italian sportswear before establishing the JD Sports chain in 1980. \"Casual was about individualism, which is key again now. It had a quality nobody had seen before and it was expensive, so it had rarity value.\" </p> <p>Men's fashion has much to thank casuals for. These were some of the first young men to take an interest in labels. Their peacockery - Lois jumbo cords, for instance, were precisely split along the seams so that they sat neatly over your Diadora Bjorn Borg Golds - foresaw a generation of men's fashion and grooming magazines. </p> <p>They have also clearly had an impact on modern culture. John Foley, editor of the Terrace Retro e-zine, suggests casual may have been overlooked because of its associations with football violence, just as skinhead has been overshadowed by racism, even though it was more about a specific music and look. \"Casual's influence has been underestimated,\" Foley says. \"It may have lost its edge because while once it was an underground subculture, now every kid is in a \u00a3100 tracksuit. The 80s revival has perhaps reminded people of its relevance. It's definitely still around, only now its standard-bearers aren't on the terraces but on stage - Oasis and Blur, for instance.\" </p> <p>Those too young to remember casual the first time round are finding new icons of style in the individualistic male celebrities picking up on the casual references of their younger days. These are the new casual generation's benchmarks of cool, just as McEnroe and Borg may have been to their big brothers: Damon Albarn is the casual rocker, Jamie Oliver is the casual chef. As Neil Sellers, Tacchini's UK managing director, puts it: \"There I was watching the Big Breakfast the other day and a presenter comes on in an original Slazenger V-neck. Need I say more?\"</p>",

Because I have extremely high self esteem, I find it hard to take any of you seriously. But I have noticed that when people fling abuse it's generally to do with their own weak spots. Therefore someone who is very keen to make money and has failed will abuse me as a moneygrubber; the sex starved will call me bitter and lonely; someone who wants to be a writer and fails will abuse my talent; the hideous will say I'm ugly; and that porky pig DAWN FRENCH always says I'm fat.

What's so much worse about 48 than 44?</p> <p><b>Dionysus72:</b> I think you were wrong about Paula Yates. I think she suffered from depression and tried every possible way to defeat it, and finally ran out of options, which was sad. Suggest you ignore the prats who cannot show common politeness.</p> <p><b>Julie:</b> Thank you and I think you are right.

For some reason, this really puts the wind up them. </p> <p><b>ptw1:</b> You know that Tony Parsons got me the job on the NME, was the best man at my wedding and a good friend for 11 years. But when I knew him he was the sweetest, kindest man you could ever meet. It's my fault I've lost touch with him now, but I think since he's become a z-list celebrity he's turned into George 'Dubya' Bush's forgotten love child - supporting capital punishment, war-mongering, macho behaviour, USA excesses and reactionary fruitcakes who shoot 14-year-old boys in the back.

      "bodyText": "spindoctor79: Please defend your assertion that nine out of 10 women who enjoy sex have been abused. Julie: I've been thinking about THAT statement for the past 2 weeks and kicking myself. Of all the dumb things I've said, that was the dumbest. I was actually thinking of porn actresses, who always say they love sex and - nine times out of 10 - have been interfered with. However, I didn't make this at all clear, it was sloppy and lazy and I apologise unreservedly to anyone I may have offended. However, I won't be apologising about nothing else, so you might as well sling your hook if that's what you're [after]. MotownJunk: You once said that you'd \"rather have cancer than be fat.\" Now that you're older, wiser, and, er, wider, do you regret talking such utter rubbish when you were younger? Julie: Ooo, yes, I said something at 18 that I don't agree with at 41! Shoot me! As Emerson said, \"Consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds\". MontyCarlo: Would you say it is true that you are neither controversial or outrageous in your writing and in fact would be better described as a conservative? Julie: Please call me what you want, because NINE TIMES OUT OF 10 it says far more about you than it does me. Because I have extremely high self esteem, I find it hard to take any of you seriously. But I have noticed that when people fling abuse it's generally to do with their own weak spots. Therefore someone who is very keen to make money and has failed will abuse me as a moneygrubber; the sex starved will call me bitter and lonely; someone who wants to be a writer and fails will abuse my talent; the hideous will say I'm ugly; and that porky pig DAWN FRENCH always says I'm fat. But insult me if it makes your own dull little lives more bearable - come on, get it all up! But don't ever mistake me for some sucker who gives a damn about your opinions, because then the laugh really is on you. RTBYRNE300: Why exactly do you generalise so broadly about Americans in your work? It gives me the impression that you don't know many of them, or at least not the interesting ones.... Julie: A good point, very well made. I'll do my best. rb496: Who, in your opinion, is the sexiest man or woman on earth and why? Julie: My boyfriend Daniel without doubt. If I was gay, Famke Janssen. niallanderson: That Tony Parsons is such a nice, inoffensive man. Discuss. Julie: Mmm, you're so right. I've always wanted to be a short-arsed middle class cry-baby who only ever made it because of who his dad was, and who said last week that he would rather live in a savagely unjust society than a fair one because the former is better for writing! I really wish I'd said that, mmmm! The only thing that interests me about Parsons is why he lies about his age. What's so much worse about 48 than 44? Dionysus72: I think you were wrong about Paula Yates. I think she suffered from depression and tried every possible way to defeat it, and finally ran out of options, which was sad. Suggest you ignore the prats who cannot show common politeness. Julie: Thank you and I think you are right. I was too harsh, but only as a reaction against all the bleeding heart sob sisters saying that she was Madame Bovary, Marilyn Monroe and Mrs Ghandi rolled into one. krystynfinn: In one of your articles you suggested you would have been a \"good\" Stalinist. If you had been born in Germany in the early twentieth century do you think you would have been a \"good\" Nazi?

What a strange question, would you ask what made Jews tick or blacks tick? I don't think so. ozzyosiris: Which of your personal qualities would make you suitable to be a role model?

The culture clash between anti-capitalists and the forces of globalisation will be fought not just on the streets of London next Tuesday but in cyberspace, for the hearts, minds and wallets of the angry, if uncommitted, young. Government sites, by their nature, belie their huge resources and manpower with a thorough but uninspiring set of links. Anarchists are far more ingenious and witty in their use of the internet to encourage and amuse. For all the protestations of the police and politicians, and whatever happens on May 1, the granddaddy of this year's sites, May Day Monopoly is bright and lucid. The idea of using the monopoly boardgame as a metaphor for the corporate takeover of streets and stations of the capital - which is what the game represents - is done with a skill and an attention to detail suggesting serious techie know-how. Slogans adorn every square of the transposed boardgame, and while only the truly corporate-at-heart could fail to grin at such idealistic calls-to-arms as: \"If you can't be bought, you can't be sold\", even the less epigrammatic \"Tell rich bastards to fuck off\" has a certain bracing camaraderie to it. But one thing the site is lacking, to the frustration of the police (if not demonstrators) is concrete detail on what is actually planned for next Tuesday. Two critical mass bike rides, which disrupt traffic entering central London during rush hour (activists on the rides dislike the term \"holding up the traffic\" as they argue that it is the cars themselves which create that jam), will leave from the Railtrack-owned stations of Marylebone and Liverpool Street at 7.30am for two separate \"West End\" and \"City\" tours. Since the privatised utilities - rail, electricity and waterworks - are both the backbone of the boardgame and one of the prime targets for any protest - this is likely to be a heavily policed start to May Day, although the history of mass demonstrations shows violence (from either side of the police line) or damage to property is likely to come later in the day. From there, until 4pm when protesters are asked to converge on Oxford Street - London's busiest shopping street - instructions are simply to \"move off around the monopoly board\". The young-at-heart will remember that the board stretches from Old Kent Road and Whitechapel, through the major rail stations and the electricity and waterworks, to Pall Mall and Mayfair. Quite a large patch for the Met to protect. Unsurprisingly, a spokeswoman for Hasbro, who took over Monopoly manufacturers from Waddingtons, refused to comment on this subversive bastardisation of the family board game.

It would be interesting to monitor their traffic flow and hits over the past fortnight as the big day approaches - and no doubt MI5 already has. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which was passed last year, the security services now have the authority to intercept emails, monitor website access and decode secret or encrypted data on individual hard drives. That power undoubtedly is the reason for the strange URL of another powerful anti-establishment site, the Network Against Terrorism Act. Based in Tonga, to avoid UK authorities, it rails against legislation passed last year by Labour which broadened the definition of \"terrorism\" to include environmental protesters demonstrating against GM food or road-building programmes.

Happily, it failed. It was 60-year-old Tito's boyhood dream to travel into space. It has cost him $18m (\u00a312m), eagerly accepted by the cash-strapped Russian space programme, and eight months of his life holed up at Moscow's Star City, the cosmonaut training centre, to realise it.</p> <p>The fledgling space tourism industry - and that includes Apollo moonwalker Buzz Aldrin, who wants to launch a lottery with a seat on the space shuttle as the prize - will be watching very carefully over the next week or so, as Russia teaches America all about capitalism in space. </p> <p>Tito's giant leap for tour reps everywhere is seen by some as the first move towards the day when we will be able to pop down to the local spaceport and buy a super saver ticket for a relaxing weekend break in orbit - and Nasa doesn't like it. </p> <p>\"There is a concept called professional jealousy,\" Mr Tito has drily observed. \"This exists in many, many fields.

When the decrepit station was sent crashing into the Pacific earlier this year, he feared his boyhood dream had burned up with it. No worries, said the Russians. We will just fly you to the ISS instead.</p> <p>Nasa was furious. In an increasingly bitter and undignified dispute with their Russian partners, the Americans repeatedly cited safety reasons as to why Mr Tito would not be allowed to set foot on the ISS. Nasa then demeaned its own safety argument somewhat by adding, rather childishly, that it \"wasn't fair\" to their own astronauts who had to endure years of training - Mr Tito simply had \"no right\" to fly. The message was clear: space is a big, scary place, so best leave it to the professionals, okay? It is definitely not meant to be fun.</p> <p>\"We will not budge,\" said Yuri Semyonov, head of the Russian space corporation Energiya. \"This is an unpleasant story,\" he added, in a nice piece of understatement. \"I think that politics are involved in it.\"</p> <p>The issue came to a head on March 19, when the cosmonauts and Mr Tito arrived at Nasa's Johnson space centre in Houston, Texas for a week of training. He was told that he would not be allowed to train. Nasa had initially complained that Mr Tito did not have enough training. Now they were refusing to provide it. Mr Tito's fellow crew members walked out.</p> <p>The Russians were ordered back by their own superiors the next day, but the gauntlet was down. \"I am actually quite surprised that Nasa has opposed my flight,\" said a carefully diplomatic Mr Tito. \"The interest that it will generate among the American public for spaceflight will be tremendous and a benefit for Nasa.\"</p> <p>After a meeting of all the ISS partners, Nasa grudgingly relented, but continued to behave petulantly, at one point talking of barring Mr Tito from the American-built section of the station - their own miniature spaceborne Berlin Wall. The current ISS commander - a Russian, luckily for Mr Tito - countered by saying he could go where he wants. Eventually Nasa settled for the intrepid adventurer signing agreements stating that he won't sue and that he will \"pay for anything he breaks\".</p> <p>\"It's the classic beginning of real space tourism,\" says John Spencer, head of the Space Tourism Society in Los Angeles, California. \"Tito is essentially our Neil Armstrong.\"</p> <p>\"When private individuals start to go,\" reckons the space tourist, \"we will learn a lot more about space from a human cultural standpoint than we know now from professional astronauts that are just trained in the field of aeronautics and astronautics.\"</p> <p>This is the heart of the matter. Since the demise of Mir, the Americans are the main players in space, and that's the way they like it. But the American public, and the world at large, stopped caring what Nasa did 30-odd years ago - about 10 minutes after Armstrong set foot on the moon, to be precise - and Nasa only has itself to blame. With many holding down day jobs in the US military, astronauts are generally brave, highly skilled and incredibly dull people - ask what it's like to fly toward the stars or float silently over the blue earth and the answer will probably have something to do with \"achieving objectives\" or \"mission parameters\".</p> <p>The people we should be sending up are the writers, reporters and poets, the painters and photographers, people who can add a warm human perspective to what is still humanity's greatest achievement. If Dennis Tito's trip of a lifetime helps usher in this new space age, then more power to him.</p> <p>All that can stop him now are technical gremlins and the weather. </p> <p>God speed, Dennis Tito.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair's Performance and Innovation unit, based in the Cabinet Office, thinks school catchment areas are a bad idea. It has told the prime minister that selection in state schools will have to be increased if he is to achieve his vision of a genuine meritocratic society in Britain.</p> <p>Its chief economist, Stephen Aldridge, wants to reduce their power \"to counteract the scope for middle class parents to buy a good education for their children by moving to the right area\".</p> <p>He's right to identify the malaise. A study by Warwick University a few weeks ago showed that in Coventry parents are prepared to pay almost 20% more for their homes to ensure their children get places at good state schools. Aldridge says: \"There is little evidence that educational expansion has enabled the working-class to catch up.\"</p> <p>But the medicine could hurt even more. Popular schools have to select some way. And if they do not give priority to geographical location, it is hard to see what they can do except select on the basis of ability - or, as the government prefers these days, the closely-related notion of \"aptitude\".</p> <p>Catchment areas are far from perfect. But they look to me like the worst system except for all the others: the best available way of ensuring that children go to schools in their local community; mixed-ability schools which don't in effect decide for them at 11 whether they will be educational successes or failures.</p> <p>Downing Street was playing down the significance of this report last night; just one idea by one economist. But it will only increase the suspicion and anxiety of those who think Tony Blair has it in for comprehensive schools.</p> <p>When the government launched its green paper on schools in February, Mr Blair's careful phrase was that he wanted to move to a \"post-comprehensive argument\". That carefully worked out line was demolished by his spokesman, Alastair Campbell, who sounded the death knell for the \"bog standard comprehensive\".</p> <p>Mr Blair wants to rapidly increase the number of specialist schools - secondaries with a particular focus on science or technology, or other areas. Those schools have the power to select up to 10% of their pupils by aptitude; within five years he wants half of all of secondaries to be specialist.</p> <p>But when the media called this a \"two tier\" system, ministers and officials claimed to be staggered. They did not expect that to be the line of attack at all, they say privately.</p> <p>But this report adds further fuel to the fears of those who believe the post-comprehensive argument means an old-style grammar/secondary split in all but name. The comps need resourcing, not demolishing. It is to be hoped that Blair sets more store by his own declared goal of increasing spending on state schools to the level enjoyed by private schools. If that were achieved, that really would deliver life chances and social mobility to those the current system leaves behind.</p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/innovation/whatsnew/socialmobility.shtml\" target=\"_NEW\">Read the paper from the Performance and Innovation Unit</a></p> <p><b>Related article</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,479308,00.html\">27.04.01: Bold No 10 idea for tax and schools</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's Performance and Innovation unit, based in the Cabinet Office, thinks school catchment areas are a bad idea. It has told the prime minister that selection in state schools will have to be increased if he is to achieve his vision of a genuine meritocratic society in Britain. Its chief economist, Stephen Aldridge, wants to reduce their power \"to counteract the scope for middle class parents to buy a good education for their children by moving to the right area\". He's right to identify the malaise. A study by Warwick University a few weeks ago showed that in Coventry parents are prepared to pay almost 20% more for their homes to ensure their children get places at good state schools. Aldridge says: \"There is little evidence that educational expansion has enabled the working-class to catch up.\" But the medicine could hurt even more. Popular schools have to select some way. And if they do not give priority to geographical location, it is hard to see what they can do except select on the basis of ability - or, as the government prefers these days, the closely-related notion of \"aptitude\". Catchment areas are far from perfect. But they look to me like the worst system except for all the others: the best available way of ensuring that children go to schools in their local community; mixed-ability schools which don't in effect decide for them at 11 whether they will be educational successes or failures. Downing Street was playing down the significance of this report last night; just one idea by one economist. But it will only increase the suspicion and anxiety of those who think Tony Blair has it in for comprehensive schools. When the government launched its green paper on schools in February, Mr Blair's careful phrase was that he wanted to move to a \"post-comprehensive argument\". That carefully worked out line was demolished by his spokesman, Alastair Campbell, who sounded the death knell for the \"bog standard comprehensive\". Mr Blair wants to rapidly increase the number of specialist schools - secondaries with a particular focus on science or technology, or other areas. Those schools have the power to select up to 10% of their pupils by aptitude; within five years he wants half of all of secondaries to be specialist. But when the media called this a \"two tier\" system, ministers and officials claimed to be staggered. They did not expect that to be the line of attack at all, they say privately. But this report adds further fuel to the fears of those who believe the post-comprehensive argument means an old-style grammar/secondary split in all but name. The comps need resourcing, not demolishing. It is to be hoped that Blair sets more store by his own declared goal of increasing spending on state schools to the level enjoyed by private schools. If that were achieved, that really would deliver life chances and social mobility to those the current system leaves behind.

In a letter to Barrett chief executive Peter Dea, the boss of Shell in the US, Walter van de Vijver, urged acceptance of the latest offer and regretted Barratt board's refusal to meet for talks. He said: \"In the interests of maximising Barrett shareholder value we continue to urge you not to enter into a merger agreement that includes break-up fees for any bidder.\" </p> <p>But Barrett has made things tougher for Shell by winning regulatory agreement for intensifying drilling in Colorado. This led to a rise in the Denver-based company's share price to a 52-week high of $62.90. </p> <p>The improved Shell offer is not surprising given a consensus on Wall Street that it would not win control of its small but successful US target without something more. </p> <p>The stakes have been raised by Shell's loss of face in failing to win the fight for Woodside.

Despite indicating previously that the offer of $55 per share for Barrett was final, the Anglo-Dutch group raised its price to $60. This was a 36% premium over Barrett's trading levels immediately before it first expressed interest in March. Shell, which is primarily interested in Barrett's extensive gas reserves in the Rocky Mountains, has also extended the offer date to May 9. Barrett in the past rejected all proposals from Shell and had called on third parties to place rival offers by early May. In a letter to Barrett chief executive Peter Dea, the boss of Shell in the US, Walter van de Vijver, urged acceptance of the latest offer and regretted Barratt board's refusal to meet for talks. He said: \"In the interests of maximising Barrett shareholder value we continue to urge you not to enter into a merger agreement that includes break-up fees for any bidder.\" But Barrett has made things tougher for Shell by winning regulatory agreement for intensifying drilling in Colorado. This led to a rise in the Denver-based company's share price to a 52-week high of $62.90. The improved Shell offer is not surprising given a consensus on Wall Street that it would not win control of its small but successful US target without something more. The stakes have been raised by Shell's loss of face in failing to win the fight for Woodside. Shell shares closed in London at 585p, up 11p.",

Coghlan, 50, was driving a blue Ford Fiesta car which was struck by a Jaguar car, allegedly driven by a fleeing armed robber, in Scammonden, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, yesterday afternoon. She was taken by air ambulance to the Leeds General Infirmary but died from her injuries today. A 32-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident, West Yorkshire police said. Police said the accident followed an earlier incident in which a man brandishing what appeared to be a handgun raided a chemists in nearby Birkby. He ran out of the shop carrying medical supplies and then allegedly threatened the driver of a white taxi parked outside. The man climbed into the cab and drove off alone but was then in collision with a Land Rover on New Hey Road, police said. Following the collision, he forced his way into a Jaguar car, which crashed into the Ford Fiesta a short time later. A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said a 32-year-old man had been arrested and was being detained in the Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where he was being treated for serious injuries. Coghlan's nephew Kevin, 20, said the family was devastated by the death. \"We just can't believe what has happened. Everyone is really upset.

      "body": "<p>Buried in the Bush administration's first budget was a routine-looking salaries estimate for the justice department. But one particular group of government lawyers saw it immediately for what it was - a signpost to a new era. The lawyers were a specialised team, put together in the Clinton years to take on the big tobacco companies for lying about the safety of their product for five decades. They had worked out that the sprawling, groundbreaking case would cost about $57m (\u00a341m). They were allocated less than $2m.</p> <p>In desperation, the lawyers leaked a memo earlier this week, in which they pointed out that the budget would kill their prosecution. In response, the attorney general, John Ashcroft, counter-leaked his plans to replace the litigation team on the grounds that it had done a shoddy job. The message could not be clearer if it was a neon sign on the White House roof: the war on Big Tobacco is over.</p> <p>The list of defendants who now appear to have escaped federal prosecution is also a list of big donors to the George Bush election campaign. At the top is Philip Morris, which gave $2.8m to the new president's war chest, his inauguration and his party. Big Tobacco as a whole gave $7m to Bush and the Republicans, 83% of the industry's total election spending. If the federal lawsuit against them is allowed to die, which now seems almost certain, the cigarette companies will have saved themselves up to $100bn in damages and compensation - an impressive rate of return by any standards. Philip Morris would argue, of course, that there is no direct connection between its donation and the apparent demise of the government lawsuit - and that its support for the president is entirely down to his policies.</p> <p>In Washington, this is not some isolated, government-rocking case of support for corporate interests. In his first 100 days in office (the milestone passes on Sunday) Bush has made this straightforward form of corporate payback the defining trait of his administration. This simple fact has been obscured by the snickering over his frequent and clunky gaffes.</p> <p>For Bush, the first US president with an MBA, the election was a straightforward business proposition in which American corporations acted as venture capitalists. They were invited to take a moderate risk and put the bulk of their political funds behind the Republican dauphin in the most expensive campaign in history. The returns, in the form of abandoned lawsuits, relaxed federal regulations and the scrapping of at least one major international treaty, are heavily loaded with short-term profit. Whatever the economic climate in the world outside, for big business it is truly springtime in Washington.</p> <p>Naturally, the Democrats have lined up to declare that they are shocked to discover that business wields such influence in politics. The corporate world did not do too badly in the Clinton years, but it was one of many voices echoing around the Oval Office. In the Bush administration, business is the only voice.</p> <p>Thus, whereas Clinton devoted much of the energy of his first 100 days to a messy fight over gays in the military, the Bush administration has briskly run through a veritable corporate shopping list of swift anti-regulatory measures.</p> <p>In his first few days, Bush scrapped a raft of work-safety measures, which had been negotiated between the federal government and the unions for much of the past decade, in an attempt to address the new work injuries of the computer age, such as repetitive strain injury, affecting an estimated 1.8m employees.</p> <p>The scrapping of the new rules was a triumph for the US Chamber of Commerce and a crushing defeat for the AFL-CIO union federation, which had of course overwhelmingly backed Al Gore and the Democrats. At the same time, Bush lifted regulations on federally funded works which gave preference to contractors who used union labour.</p> <p>Next on the list was a bankruptcy bill, long demanded by the banks and credit card companies (who sponsored Bush and his party to the tune of over $25m). Its effect will be to strip Americans who have declared themselves bankrupt of some of the legal protection they have from their financial creditors.</p> <p>The bill's proponents portrayed the targets of the bill as scam artists and irresponsible spendthrifts, but subsequent press reports and surveys suggested that the majority of the victims will be poor families who have lost jobs and fallen foul of the rapacious US health system. Clinton had vetoed a similar bill on the grounds that the poor should be allowed to pay their rent and hospital bills before their credit card charges.</p> <p>The impact of the Bush era has fallen heaviest, however, on the environment, where the legal constraints on business had been the most expensive. In short order after his inauguration, Bush lifted rules which would have made mining companies (who donated $2.6m to his campaign) pay for the clean-up costs if they contaminated the public water supply, and then scrapped safety limits on arsenic levels in drinking water imposed by the outgoing Clinton White House.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another Clinton-era regulation aimed at protecting 60m acres of national forests from logging and road building is also about to be scuttled, according to justice department sources quoted in yesterday's Washington Post. The ban had been one of the last acts of the outgoing administration, but it had been a consequence of more than a year of open hearings held by the Forest Service in which the views of 1.6m members of the public had been taken into account. For its part, the timber industry contributed $3.2m to the Bush campaign in the 2000 elections. The money, it seems, is talking louder.</p> <p>The most important environmental victories for US industry came in March, when the new president abandoned a campaign pledge to impose legal limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The obvious consequence of that decision arrived a few days later, when the administration let it be known that it considered the Kyoto protocol on global warming dead and buried, summarily ending five years of transatlantic efforts to agree on how the accord should be implemented.</p> <p>The head of the environmental protection agency, Christine Todd Whitman, has promised that the US is ready to go back to the negotiating table and start again from scratch. But meanwhile, the cost of cutting emissions has been removed for the foreseeable future from the corporate balance sheets of the coal, electricity, oil and gas industries, all of them major Bush contributors. The oil sector alone put over $25m into Republican coffers for last year's election, compared to the $7m backing it provided to Democratic candidates.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising that the mood on K Street, the home of Washington's industrial lobbyists, is triumphant these days. \"We have come out of the cave, blinking in the sunlight, saying to one another, 'My God, now we can actually get something done,' \" Richard Hohlt, a banking lobbyist, recently told the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the only major setback the industrial lobby has suffered under Bush so far has been the old-fashioned cold war exchange of sabre-rattling with China. It has been redolent of an older, more ideological strain of Republicanism, but it cuts against the interests of corporate leaders, who view China as a vast opportunity for expansion. Consequently, there were few protests from the usual cold warriors in the party ranks when Washington sent a delicately worded apology to Beijing over this month's spy plane standoff. On every other front, the K Street army has emerged from its trenches to find that there is hardly even token resistance to its relentless advance.</p> <p>In his former role as Clinton's labour secretary, Robert Reich had frequently complained that corporate America seemed to gain the upper hand more often than not in the corridors of power. Now, he says, there is not even a fight. \"There's no longer any countervailing power in Washington. Business is in complete control of the machinery of government,\" he wrote in the New York Times. \"It's payback time, and every industry and trade association is busily cashing in.\"</p> <p>The transaction has not been so much a purchase as a corporate merger. The distinction between business and government has simply been blurred to near invisibility. The White House has made much of the fact that the new MBA-equipped president is running the administration along sleek corporate lines. Key officials, meanwhile, are being recruited straight from the nation's boardrooms.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, came from the giant aluminium manufacturer Alcoa. Dick Cheney was headhunted from the oil services company Haliburton. Karl Rove, Bush's chief political strategist, performed the same function for Philip Morris from 1991 to 1996. The new \"regulations czar\", John Graham, charged with overseeing the further dismantling of government controls on industry, has arrived from John Hopkins University, where he once oversaw a study concluding that there were no health risks from secondhand cigarette smoke. At the same time, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen, Graham was soliciting $25,000 in funding from Philip Morris.</p> <p>The list of business alunmi is endless. Mitchell Daniels, the head of the White House office of management and budget, is a former vice-president of the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. He represents an industry which contributed $18m to the Bush electoral effort and now expects the administration to distance itself from its predecessor's plans to impose price caps on prescription medicine.</p> <p>The only risk to the mega-corporations' control over Washington appears to come from within - the danger of overreaching and provoking an electoral backlash against their greed and environmental damage. \"At some point - perhaps as soon as the 2002 midterm elections, surely no later than the next presidential election - the public will be aghast at what is happening,\" Reich argues. \"The backlash against business may be thunderous.\"</p> <p>There are already signs that Bush and his advisors realise the danger, and there have been attempts to soften the president's image, particularly on the environment. He has signalled his readiness to sign a treaty on curbing the industrial release of particularly noxious chemicals and may think again on arsenic limits in drinking water. After all, Bush will need people's votes as well as corporate money if he is to win re-election in 2004. But all the signs from the first 100 days suggest that the moderating non-corporate influences on the administration are likely to be kept to a minimum. This is as close as it is possible to get in a democracy to a government of business, by business and for business.</p> <p><b>Funding for favours: Bush's paybacks</b></p> <p>Table shows amount paid (in millions of dollars) to the Republican election campaign and that amount as a percentage of each industry's election spending.</p> <p><b> Industry</b> | $m | % | The payback</p> <p><b>Tobacco</b> | 7.0 | 83% | Killing off federal lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers<br> <b>Timber</b> | 3.2 | 82% | Restrictions on logging roads scrapped</p> <p><b>Oil and gas</b> | 25.4 | 78% | Restrictions on CO2 emissions abandoned; Kyoto scrapped; moves to open Arctic refuge to drilling</p> <p><b>Mining</b> | 2.6 | 77% | Scrapping of environmental clean-up rules; arsenic limits in water supply</p> <p><b>Banks and credit card companies</b> | 25.6 | 60% | Bankruptcy bill making it easier for credit card companies to collect debts from bankrupt customers</p> <p><b>Pharmaceuticals</b> | 17.8 | 68% | Medicare reform without price controls</p> <p><b>Airlines</b> | 4.2 | 61% | Federal barriers to strikes; backpedalling on antitrust legislation</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/\">US election race</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/flash/0,7365,465904,00.html\">By George!

Big Tobacco as a whole gave $7m to Bush and the Republicans, 83% of the industry's total election spending. If the federal lawsuit against them is allowed to die, which now seems almost certain, the cigarette companies will have saved themselves up to $100bn in damages and compensation - an impressive rate of return by any standards. Philip Morris would argue, of course, that there is no direct connection between its donation and the apparent demise of the government lawsuit - and that its support for the president is entirely down to his policies. In Washington, this is not some isolated, government-rocking case of support for corporate interests. In his first 100 days in office (the milestone passes on Sunday) Bush has made this straightforward form of corporate payback the defining trait of his administration. This simple fact has been obscured by the snickering over his frequent and clunky gaffes. For Bush, the first US president with an MBA, the election was a straightforward business proposition in which American corporations acted as venture capitalists. They were invited to take a moderate risk and put the bulk of their political funds behind the Republican dauphin in the most expensive campaign in history. The returns, in the form of abandoned lawsuits, relaxed federal regulations and the scrapping of at least one major international treaty, are heavily loaded with short-term profit. Whatever the economic climate in the world outside, for big business it is truly springtime in Washington. Naturally, the Democrats have lined up to declare that they are shocked to discover that business wields such influence in politics. The corporate world did not do too badly in the Clinton years, but it was one of many voices echoing around the Oval Office. In the Bush administration, business is the only voice. Thus, whereas Clinton devoted much of the energy of his first 100 days to a messy fight over gays in the military, the Bush administration has briskly run through a veritable corporate shopping list of swift anti-regulatory measures. In his first few days, Bush scrapped a raft of work-safety measures, which had been negotiated between the federal government and the unions for much of the past decade, in an attempt to address the new work injuries of the computer age, such as repetitive strain injury, affecting an estimated 1.8m employees. The scrapping of the new rules was a triumph for the US Chamber of Commerce and a crushing defeat for the AFL-CIO union federation, which had of course overwhelmingly backed Al Gore and the Democrats. At the same time, Bush lifted regulations on federally funded works which gave preference to contractors who used union labour. Next on the list was a bankruptcy bill, long demanded by the banks and credit card companies (who sponsored Bush and his party to the tune of over $25m). Its effect will be to strip Americans who have declared themselves bankrupt of some of the legal protection they have from their financial creditors. The bill's proponents portrayed the targets of the bill as scam artists and irresponsible spendthrifts, but subsequent press reports and surveys suggested that the majority of the victims will be poor families who have lost jobs and fallen foul of the rapacious US health system. Clinton had vetoed a similar bill on the grounds that the poor should be allowed to pay their rent and hospital bills before their credit card charges. The impact of the Bush era has fallen heaviest, however, on the environment, where the legal constraints on business had been the most expensive. In short order after his inauguration, Bush lifted rules which would have made mining companies (who donated $2.6m to his campaign) pay for the clean-up costs if they contaminated the public water supply, and then scrapped safety limits on arsenic levels in drinking water imposed by the outgoing Clinton White House. Meanwhile, another Clinton-era regulation aimed at protecting 60m acres of national forests from logging and road building is also about to be scuttled, according to justice department sources quoted in yesterday's Washington Post. The ban had been one of the last acts of the outgoing administration, but it had been a consequence of more than a year of open hearings held by the Forest Service in which the views of 1.6m members of the public had been taken into account. For its part, the timber industry contributed $3.2m to the Bush campaign in the 2000 elections. The money, it seems, is talking louder. The most important environmental victories for US industry came in March, when the new president abandoned a campaign pledge to impose legal limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The obvious consequence of that decision arrived a few days later, when the administration let it be known that it considered the Kyoto protocol on global warming dead and buried, summarily ending five years of transatlantic efforts to agree on how the accord should be implemented. The head of the environmental protection agency, Christine Todd Whitman, has promised that the US is ready to go back to the negotiating table and start again from scratch. But meanwhile, the cost of cutting emissions has been removed for the foreseeable future from the corporate balance sheets of the coal, electricity, oil and gas industries, all of them major Bush contributors. The oil sector alone put over $25m into Republican coffers for last year's election, compared to the $7m backing it provided to Democratic candidates. It is hardly surprising that the mood on K Street, the home of Washington's industrial lobbyists, is triumphant these days. \"We have come out of the cave, blinking in the sunlight, saying to one another, 'My God, now we can actually get something done,' \" Richard Hohlt, a banking lobbyist, recently told the Wall Street Journal. Paradoxically, the only major setback the industrial lobby has suffered under Bush so far has been the old-fashioned cold war exchange of sabre-rattling with China. It has been redolent of an older, more ideological strain of Republicanism, but it cuts against the interests of corporate leaders, who view China as a vast opportunity for expansion. Consequently, there were few protests from the usual cold warriors in the party ranks when Washington sent a delicately worded apology to Beijing over this month's spy plane standoff. On every other front, the K Street army has emerged from its trenches to find that there is hardly even token resistance to its relentless advance. In his former role as Clinton's labour secretary, Robert Reich had frequently complained that corporate America seemed to gain the upper hand more often than not in the corridors of power. Now, he says, there is not even a fight. \"There's no longer any countervailing power in Washington. Business is in complete control of the machinery of government,\" he wrote in the New York Times. \"It's payback time, and every industry and trade association is busily cashing in.\" The transaction has not been so much a purchase as a corporate merger. The distinction between business and government has simply been blurred to near invisibility. The White House has made much of the fact that the new MBA-equipped president is running the administration along sleek corporate lines. Key officials, meanwhile, are being recruited straight from the nation's boardrooms. The treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, came from the giant aluminium manufacturer Alcoa. Dick Cheney was headhunted from the oil services company Haliburton. Karl Rove, Bush's chief political strategist, performed the same function for Philip Morris from 1991 to 1996. The new \"regulations czar\", John Graham, charged with overseeing the further dismantling of government controls on industry, has arrived from John Hopkins University, where he once oversaw a study concluding that there were no health risks from secondhand cigarette smoke. At the same time, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen, Graham was soliciting $25,000 in funding from Philip Morris. The list of business alunmi is endless. Mitchell Daniels, the head of the White House office of management and budget, is a former vice-president of the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. He represents an industry which contributed $18m to the Bush electoral effort and now expects the administration to distance itself from its predecessor's plans to impose price caps on prescription medicine. The only risk to the mega-corporations' control over Washington appears to come from within - the danger of overreaching and provoking an electoral backlash against their greed and environmental damage. \"At some point - perhaps as soon as the 2002 midterm elections, surely no later than the next presidential election - the public will be aghast at what is happening,\" Reich argues. \"The backlash against business may be thunderous.\" There are already signs that Bush and his advisors realise the danger, and there have been attempts to soften the president's image, particularly on the environment. He has signalled his readiness to sign a treaty on curbing the industrial release of particularly noxious chemicals and may think again on arsenic limits in drinking water. After all, Bush will need people's votes as well as corporate money if he is to win re-election in 2004. But all the signs from the first 100 days suggest that the moderating non-corporate influences on the administration are likely to be kept to a minimum. This is as close as it is possible to get in a democracy to a government of business, by business and for business.

Mr and Mrs Stone, who are devastated at the prospect of losing their pet, appealed on the grounds that Porky lives indoors and has had no contact with farm animals. The animal has been checked by a vet and has no signs of foot-and-mouth disease, according to their daughter Georgie Cartner, 39, who bought the pet for her father 10 years ago.</p> <p>On Wednesday, officials from the Scottish Executive's Rural Affairs Department arrived at the Stones' home on Wednesday but were refused entry by the family. Mrs Cartner, who lives next door to her parents, said: \"A vet came and someone else from the Scottish Executive but we didn't let them in. They said they had the power of forcible entry but left after three hours. By that time about 20 people from the village had gathered at the gate. It's a small village and people are being very supportive.\"</p> <p>She said her 78-year-old father has had the pet since Porky was just weeks old and has kept him inside the house since he suffered pneumonia as a piglet. She said: \"He wanted a pet pig... everyone is very fond of Porky. We don't see why he should be killed, he's kept in the kitchen because he had pneumonia as a baby and the farm which is infected is two miles away and it was infected seven weeks ago.\"</p> <p>She said the family had contacted a solicitor and planned to mount a legal challenge to stop Porky being killed.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Executive said he was unable to go into detail about the Stones' case because of the possible legal action. However he confirmed that their home falls within the 3km cull zone of \"susceptible animals\" such as sheep, pigs and goats.</p> <p>Porky is considerably less photogenic than Phoenix and the government's new policy applies only to cattle, not pigs or sheep, which are more susceptible to foot-and-mouth.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

      "bodyText": "After Phoenix, the calf which became a national icon after escaping the clutches of the slaughtermen, residents of a Scottish village are rallying to save Porky, a pot-bellied pet pig. Residents of Ruthwell Station in Dumfries and Galloway have rallied round owners George and Sadie Stone in their bid to prevent the slaughter of 10-year-old Porky. The pet is due to be killed under the pre-emptive cull policy because the family bungalow falls within 3km of an infected farm. Mr and Mrs Stone, who are devastated at the prospect of losing their pet, appealed on the grounds that Porky lives indoors and has had no contact with farm animals. The animal has been checked by a vet and has no signs of foot-and-mouth disease, according to their daughter Georgie Cartner, 39, who bought the pet for her father 10 years ago. On Wednesday, officials from the Scottish Executive's Rural Affairs Department arrived at the Stones' home on Wednesday but were refused entry by the family. Mrs Cartner, who lives next door to her parents, said: \"A vet came and someone else from the Scottish Executive but we didn't let them in. They said they had the power of forcible entry but left after three hours. By that time about 20 people from the village had gathered at the gate. It's a small village and people are being very supportive.\" She said her 78-year-old father has had the pet since Porky was just weeks old and has kept him inside the house since he suffered pneumonia as a piglet. She said: \"He wanted a pet pig... everyone is very fond of Porky. We don't see why he should be killed, he's kept in the kitchen because he had pneumonia as a baby and the farm which is infected is two miles away and it was infected seven weeks ago.\" She said the family had contacted a solicitor and planned to mount a legal challenge to stop Porky being killed. A spokesman for the Scottish Executive said he was unable to go into detail about the Stones' case because of the possible legal action. However he confirmed that their home falls within the 3km cull zone of \"susceptible animals\" such as sheep, pigs and goats. Porky is considerably less photogenic than Phoenix and the government's new policy applies only to cattle, not pigs or sheep, which are more susceptible to foot-and-mouth.

Charityfair headlines: 'Charities will lose sympathy for doing the government's work' Major concerns about the growing links between the voluntary sector and government have been raised by charity leaders. 'Sector should speak with unified voice' Too many volunteering organisations are in competition with each other, which is weakening the sector's influence on government policy, claims the chief executive of a high profile national campaign. Charities urged to 'be brash with funders' There needs to be a cultural change on the part of charities and funders if widespread problems in funding the core costs of voluntary organisations are to be addressed, according to speakers at a Charityfair debate.

Mr Byers is instead to refer the paper's coverage to the press complaints commission, the press industry's self regulatory body. It was suggested that he regarded the referral as the most cost effective way of seeking redress. Government sources insisted that Mr Byers would retain his option to sue the paper if he was not satisfied by the PCC's ruling, but in practice he is unlikely to take the case further. His decision raised questions as to why he did not refer the original story to the PCC in the first place. There had been reports that the No 10 press secretary, Alastair Campbell, urged Mr Byers to take the Daily Mail to court in a pre-election shot across the bows of the rightwing press. Since his announcement of an intention to sue, the Daily Mail and the author Tom Bower have refused to back down on the accusation, let alone offer an apology. The permanent secretary at the DTI had ruled that any legal action by Mr Byers would be underwritten by the government on the basis that he had allegedly been defamed in his role as a government minister. Government sources insisted that Mr Byers's latest decision had been his own and not forced on him by civil servants convinced that any libel action would be worthwhile. The controversy developed after the Daily Mail alleged that Mr Byers had buried aspects of the DTI inspectors' report on Mr Robinson's companies. Mr Byers insisted that the inquiry, set up the month after Mr Byers took over at the DTI from Peter Mandelson, was conducted at every stage by civil servants without ministerial involvement.",

      "body": "<p>Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, was today visiting a mass burial site in one of the areas worst affected by the foot and mouth outbreak, as seven people waited to learn if they had contracted the disease.</p> <p>Mr Hoon's visit to Devon comes after a junior health minister revealed that the government had known for several weeks of potential public health risks from burning animal carcasses before an assessment was published on the Department of Health's website on Wednesday.</p> <p>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath told peers last night that medical consultants had been notified by the Public Health Laboratory Service as long ago as March 1.</p> <p>Yesterday, four more people were beginning tests for foot and mouth disease after visiting their doctors with health fears. Three others have already been tested for the disease, which is very rare in humans.</p> <p>Mr Hoon was today joining Major General Arthur Denaro, the army commander in charge of the outbreak in the south west, on a visit to the site in Ashmoor in Devon where up to 400,000 animals will be buried.</p> <p>The defence secretary was expected to underline that government policy could be \"refined\" in line with scientific advice only because of the decline in the number of foot and mouth cases.</p> <p>Yesterday Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, defended his decision to \"refine\" the government's cull policy amid charges that the change was triggered by the plight of Phoenix the calf.</p> <p>He announced that vets would be allowed to decide whether cattle on farms neighbouring infected sites should face slaughter or be spared because of their low risk of infection.</p> <p>There have been just six new cases in Devon in the last week compared with a high of 28 in the week ending 16 April.</p> <p>The average number of daily cases has fallen to 16 against a high of 43 just three weeks ago, while the total number of farms lifted out of infected area status is 15,000.</p>

      "bodyText": "Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, was today visiting a mass burial site in one of the areas worst affected by the foot and mouth outbreak, as seven people waited to learn if they had contracted the disease. Mr Hoon's visit to Devon comes after a junior health minister revealed that the government had known for several weeks of potential public health risks from burning animal carcasses before an assessment was published on the Department of Health's website on Wednesday. Lord Hunt of Kings Heath told peers last night that medical consultants had been notified by the Public Health Laboratory Service as long ago as March 1. Yesterday, four more people were beginning tests for foot and mouth disease after visiting their doctors with health fears. Three others have already been tested for the disease, which is very rare in humans. Mr Hoon was today joining Major General Arthur Denaro, the army commander in charge of the outbreak in the south west, on a visit to the site in Ashmoor in Devon where up to 400,000 animals will be buried. The defence secretary was expected to underline that government policy could be \"refined\" in line with scientific advice only because of the decline in the number of foot and mouth cases. Yesterday Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, defended his decision to \"refine\" the government's cull policy amid charges that the change was triggered by the plight of Phoenix the calf. He announced that vets would be allowed to decide whether cattle on farms neighbouring infected sites should face slaughter or be spared because of their low risk of infection. There have been just six new cases in Devon in the last week compared with a high of 28 in the week ending 16 April. The average number of daily cases has fallen to 16 against a high of 43 just three weeks ago, while the total number of farms lifted out of infected area status is 15,000. What's going on?

      "bodyText": "Up to 300,000 tourism jobs could be affected by the foot and mouth crisis, the chairman of the British Tourist Authority (BTA) warned today. Between a fifth and a quarter of all jobs in the sector could be lost in some areas, with up to \u00a35bn worth of trade sacrificed to the disease, David Quarmby said. \"We could be losing up to \u00a32.5bn worth of inbound tourism to Britain this year, and on the domestic market there could be at least another \u00a32bn to \u00a33bn of lost tourism,\" he said. \"You could be looking at \u00a35bn worth that is not going into tourism and the rural economy. \"On a very simple calculation, that could be worth up to 300,000 jobs affected by the crisis in tourism. It is an industry that employs nearly 2m people, a lot of them in part-time jobs, and we are looking at up to 20% loss, 25% in some areas, perhaps even more.\" The BTA chairman also warned it could take several years to rebuild tourists' confidence in Britain as a destination. \"Although the Gulf war was nowhere near western Europe, it took three or four years for us to rebuild Americans' confidence in Britain as a destination,\" he said. \"Our fear is that without adequate activity it could take at least as long to rebuild confidence in foot and mouth.\" The interview is published at www.ePolitix.com.

A total of 128 farmers who saw infected livestock slaughtered were questioned about their expectations once the crisis is finally over. Of these, 6% said that they planned to quit agriculture all together - three times the percentage which leave the industry in a normal year - while 36% said that they only planned to partially restock their farms. Fewer than half expect their businesses to recover in the near future. Almost half of those questioned thought they had been adequately compensated by the government for slaughtered livestock, while less than a fifth believed a programme of vaccination should have been introduced. Industry magazine Farmers Weekly, which carried out the survey, said that its findings provide the first glimpse of farming in the wake of the epidemic. The National Farmers' Union said that it would have expected even more farmers to claim they were leaving the industry. Policy director Martin Haworth said: \"The compensation they have got is fair, so it is not surprising that some will get out of farming. \"Many farmers we are talking to say this is a unique opportunity for them to re-think their businesses,\" he added. \"Farmers who previously opted for quantity are telling us they are now going to go for quality. That is not a bad thing.\" The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, also acknowledged that the foot and mouth outbreak might prompt some livestock farmers to quit the industry. \"I certainly think that the foot and mouth disease outbreak has been the last straw for some farmers,\" he said. \"The average age in the industry is 58 and, when farmers go through the heartbreaking process of seeing their stock slaughtered out, they get their compensation payment from the government, and they are bound to think - particularly if they are in their late fifties - as to whether they should go through all the business of re-stocking and starting again, or consider retiring. \"Frankly I don't blame them for thinking about that.\" Meanwhile, the high-ranking officer who masterminded the army's battle against foot and mouth in Cumbria, was today handing over command as he retired from the forces. Brigadier Alex Birtwistle said that he was sad to leave his dedicated team, but he felt that the battle against the disease was being won in the county.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people will learn if their children or relatives were secretly stripped of their vital organs when they died, the government was due to announce today. More than 100 NHS trusts in England were being given the go-ahead to start telling people whether hearts, lungs and other organs had been stripped from dead relatives without their consent. A moratorium had been imposed on trusts giving out the information in the wake of the damning Alder Hey inquiry into organ retention. The Alder Hey report found that children who had died at the Liverpool hospital had been systematically stripped of their organs without their parents' knowledge or consent. During the inquiry it also emerged that more than 100,000 hearts, lungs and other organs were still being held by hospitals around the country. An investigation by chief medical officer professor Liam Donaldson found that thousands of people may have buried their loved ones not knowing they had been stripped of many or all of their internal organs. The findings, published earlier this year, sparked panic as people jammed hospital switchboards, trying to discover whether relatives who had died sometimes decades ago were among those whose organs had been retained. But poor record keeping meant that many hospitals had difficulty tracing organs. And the government was anxious to avoid a repeat of events at Alder Hey, where parents were often forced to go through multiple funerals for their dead children as more of their retained organs were discovered. The moratorium was imposed on all hospitals as a nationwide audit of retained organs was carried out. A retained organs commission was also set up to oversee the audit and review the whole issue. Chairwoman of the commission, professor Margaret Brazier, was today giving selected hospitals the go-ahead to start giving information to people who have inquired about retained organs. The move could see many more people demanding the return of vital organs and conducting second funerals for their loved ones.

      "bodyText": "Major concerns about the growing links between the voluntary sector and government have been raised by charity leaders. Speaking at a Charityfair debate on ethics, Directory of Social Change director Mike Eastwood said: \"There's a sense in which the voluntary sector has lost the plot somewhat and the idea that we're different from government is being questioned.\" He said there was nothing wrong with delivering good quality services in contracts with the statutory sector but that charities needed to be seen as different to the government and private sector. \"If charities are seen as simply doing the work of the government they will lose public sympathy,\" he said. Andrea Kelmanson, a consultant and former director of the National Centre for Volunteering, expressed concerns that charities receiving government money were being expected to carry out the politicians' agenda. \"I understand that who pays the piper calls the tune, but funders have a responsibility that just because they've got the money doesn't meant they've got all the answers. They're missing opportunities if they don't talk to those receiving funds.\" Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of south London charity Kids Company, said she was worried that sometimes, when the charity had been consulted by the government on spending on children's services, the agenda had already been set. \"We take part in discussions but there are one or two people who have already decided what and how the money will be spent and the rest of us tag along,\" she said. There was also criticism of the importation of \"business speak\" into the voluntary sector and claims that business practices could not necessarily be transferred to charities. Ms Kelmanson said that since the 1980s the voluntary sector had largely adopted business sector vocabulary to define its work: \"There's a need for a new language [that reflects the voluntary sector].\" Another concern raised at the debate was that, in order to win funding, an increasing number of charities promote a simplistic view about resolving problems and overstate what they can achieve. Hilary Blume, director of the Charities Advisory Trust, said many of the social problems charities dealt with were intractable: \"We can have some impact but we can't solve the problems. \"We can make things better but we can't make them right and I'm worried about the stories charities tell in order to get funds.\" She criticised campaigns such as the NSPCC Full Stop campaign against child cruelty, arguing that it was misleading to suggest that child abuse could be halted. Ms Blume said she was disappointed that the voluntary sector had not made more impact on social injustice in the last 30 years: \"I'm ashamed that there is more poverty and there are more children going to bed hungry today than when I started, despite the \u00a32bn that the lottery has given to charities.\" But others were more positive about the current role of the sector.

      "body": "<p>Sir Christopher Bland fell back on a well worn, if slightly corrupted, aphorism yesterday. \"I don't like to talk in terms of the size of BT's problems,\" he said. \"The challenge is big. It's a very substantial challenge but not one I'd have taken on if I didn't think I could do it or if I didn't think it would be fun.\" </p> <p>Opportunities not problems. If that is the case he has just taken on the opportunity of a lifetime. </p> <p>The BBC chairman, who takes up the same post at BT on Tuesday, walks into a company with deep rooted problems. Investors had been baying for blood and got some yesterday when Sir Iain Vallance announced his decision to step down as chairman after 35 years with the company and little more than a year away from retirement. He had been on the BT board since it split from the Post Office in 1981. </p> <p>The City was relieved that some action had been taken at last. But this is only the beginning of what the City hopes will be further radical steps before BT can start a process of rehabilitation. </p> <p>In the past 18 months BT's share price has crumbled from a peak of almost \u00a315 to the \u00a35 mark. The company is now dwarfed by Vodafone, a business which began life only a decade ago but which has played its cards with better insight and a lot more chutzpah. </p> <p>BT has found itself overstretched and laden with debts of \u00a330bn. Its credit is on review and it may lose its cherished 'A' rating, which means the cost of borrowing soars. Some of the company's stategic moves, such as the merger of its international corporate business with AT&amp;T of the US, are losing money and the company is being forced to retrench. After laying its footprint across Asia, Canada and other parts of the world, BT is being forced back to Britain with its tail between its legs. </p> <p>Last year it pledged to pay back \u00a310bn by the end of 2001. In the meantime, however, markets have turned against the company. Hopes of partial stock market flotations of BT Wireless, its mobile phone business, and its yellow pages operation have been dashed by the lack of appetite for new telecoms shares. At the same time the appetite among buyers for some of its assets has also dried up. BT is, in the words of one City analyst, \"in a state of paralysis\". </p> <p>Sir Iain, who will remain as \"president emeritus\", was viewed as an important obstacle to be removed. He has been famously described as having BT running through him like a stick of rock and his removal will perhaps make previously unthinkable decisions thinkable. With a new chairman in place and a new finance director, there will be fewer sacred cows. </p> <p>The finance director, Philip Hampton, oversaw the break-up of British Gas. Sir Christopher managed significant cultural change at the BBC. </p> <p>\"We are rather fans of Sir Christopher,\" said Benedict Evans, telecoms analyst at investment bank West LB Panmure. \"He has a good record and has experience of companies that have been in difficulty. He could hardly be worse than Vallance. </p> <p>\"In general people in the City are starting to feel that BT is turning the corner.

      "bodyText": "Sir Christopher Bland fell back on a well worn, if slightly corrupted, aphorism yesterday. \"I don't like to talk in terms of the size of BT's problems,\" he said. \"The challenge is big. It's a very substantial challenge but not one I'd have taken on if I didn't think I could do it or if I didn't think it would be fun.\" Opportunities not problems. If that is the case he has just taken on the opportunity of a lifetime. The BBC chairman, who takes up the same post at BT on Tuesday, walks into a company with deep rooted problems. Investors had been baying for blood and got some yesterday when Sir Iain Vallance announced his decision to step down as chairman after 35 years with the company and little more than a year away from retirement. He had been on the BT board since it split from the Post Office in 1981. The City was relieved that some action had been taken at last. But this is only the beginning of what the City hopes will be further radical steps before BT can start a process of rehabilitation. In the past 18 months BT's share price has crumbled from a peak of almost \u00a315 to the \u00a35 mark. The company is now dwarfed by Vodafone, a business which began life only a decade ago but which has played its cards with better insight and a lot more chutzpah. BT has found itself overstretched and laden with debts of \u00a330bn. Its credit is on review and it may lose its cherished 'A' rating, which means the cost of borrowing soars. Some of the company's stategic moves, such as the merger of its international corporate business with AT&amp;T of the US, are losing money and the company is being forced to retrench. After laying its footprint across Asia, Canada and other parts of the world, BT is being forced back to Britain with its tail between its legs. Last year it pledged to pay back \u00a310bn by the end of 2001. In the meantime, however, markets have turned against the company. Hopes of partial stock market flotations of BT Wireless, its mobile phone business, and its yellow pages operation have been dashed by the lack of appetite for new telecoms shares. At the same time the appetite among buyers for some of its assets has also dried up. BT is, in the words of one City analyst, \"in a state of paralysis\". Sir Iain, who will remain as \"president emeritus\", was viewed as an important obstacle to be removed. He has been famously described as having BT running through him like a stick of rock and his removal will perhaps make previously unthinkable decisions thinkable. With a new chairman in place and a new finance director, there will be fewer sacred cows. The finance director, Philip Hampton, oversaw the break-up of British Gas. Sir Christopher managed significant cultural change at the BBC. \"We are rather fans of Sir Christopher,\" said Benedict Evans, telecoms analyst at investment bank West LB Panmure. \"He has a good record and has experience of companies that have been in difficulty. He could hardly be worse than Vallance. \"In general people in the City are starting to feel that BT is turning the corner. With Hampton and Sir Christopher in place, there are people in the company not associated with the failures of the past few years - the ones who have been sitting there saying nothing is wrong.\" Cash call Sir Christopher indicated that if anything he would be pushing for a quickening of pace. \"One of the things BT has to do is to get on with paying down its debt. I'm not about to slow that down. If anything, I want to see it accelerated. Debt is plainly on top of the board's agenda and I wouldn't want to move it down.\" Speculation is that BT will make a \u00a35bn cash call on its shareholders through a deeply discounted rights issue.

The Evil Garden is a collaboration with writer/illustrator Edward Gorey, who died before recording began. Five texts are included, whose sentiments would have been rather too misanthropic for Rumi. \"She cindered toast and rotted silk / Corroded tin and curdled milk,\" croons Tippetts sweetly in The Disrespectful Summons, while Akchote's playing moves from Frisell territory into the Hendrix badlands. </p> <p>Such \"songs\" are mixed with abstract instrumentals, whose bass-less melancholy plausibly parallels Gorey's creepy monochrome images, several of which come with the CD.

Napa? 'Beetha? Punta? Sorry, where was that? Ever since Ibiza gave us the concept of the clubbing holiday, it seems everyone has been keen to supplant the Balearic island's (dubious) charms. Every year dance and style magazines fall over their boarding passes to convince us that somewhere, anywhere, is the New Ibiza. It doesn't work, of course, and our little rave monkeys continue to migrate annually to Ibiza to get royally twatted - sorry, dance in the sunshine. And why not? It may be easy to mock Ibiza, but the island has clubs such as the open-air Space and DC10 that on a good night can still prove genuinely inspiring, and it has a mixture of relaxed cosmopolitan chic and the profanely hedonistic that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else. </p> <p>If last year was the turn of Cypriot resort Ayia Napa to hog the limelight and column inches, this year, all the talk is of Uruguay - but talk is all it is. Jet-set resort Punta del Este sounds idyllic, and for the elite few who have been flown over to party there, no doubt it is (Jealous? Moi? Perish the thought). Liverpool superclub Cream has opened a bar on its beach, and now comes that essential for every clubbing holiday destination: the compilation album. Chillout-room stalwarts A Man Called Adam have been inextricably linked with magical Ibiza ever since singer Sally Rogers appeared wibbling away in a charmingly off-cake \"you're my best friend\" manner on Channel 4's 1990 Ibiza raveumentary A Short Film About Chilling. So who better to launch the assault on South America's shores? </p> <p>Sadly, these latter-day chillout conquistadors have abandoned any attempt to incorporate local rhumbas and tangos into this mix; instead the selection is a languidly laid-back one that would sound equally good in Blackpool as in Uruguay's chicest boutique. Of course, the real sound of Punta is banging house music, but why let that get in the way of a good concept? We're told that they've (somewhat pointlessly) sampled the local frogs' croaking for the mix, but the real highlight is up-and-coming London duo Zero 7's delightful remix of Radiohead's Climbing Up the Walls, which lends Thom Yorke's voice an uncharacteristically comforting edge. On the folk-edged 16 Again, meanwhile, underrated Nottingham pair Neon Heights confirm their position as the group that most needs to be handed a fat record contract right now. </p> <p>Over in Ayia Napa, there's no time for relaxing tunes. Mixed by the Heartless Crew, Ayia Napa - Return to Fantasy Island is a tie-in with the terrifying fly-on-the-hotel-wall series recently shouted at by pissed students of a Friday night. There is a real and growing scene in Napa, with most heavyweight London garage clubs promoting their own nights, but the hard-drinking holidaymakers there are far more Majorca than Ibiza. As the series itself focused on last year's season, this compilation has the perfect excuse to trot out a selection of Y2K classics from garage's annus mirabilis. This is the sort of music that thumps out at you from commercial breaks and prompts kettles to go on across the country - you say \"Ayia\", I say \"Make me a nice cup of tea.\" </p> <p>Back in London and off to the pub. Heavenly Social was the original club in a pub, a riotous Sunday night knees-up that made superstars of the Chemical Brothers. Half a decade on and Heavenly has opened its own bars in London and Nottingham. DJ Stuart Paterson brings his record boxes to the London branch every Thursday and his Deviant compilation gives a snapshot of what he plays to drown out the noise of crunching Twiglets. It's a broad spectrum, taking in all manner of mellow, soulful grooves. There's booming hip-hop and long-deleted gems including Chicago folk-soul brother Terry Callier's euphoric 1960s Ordinary Joe and Dillinger's anti-drugs reggae shuffler Cocaine. The Blow Monkeys provide this month's bizarre pop moment - but then Dr Robert and gang's flamenco-funk B-side La Passionara has long been a staple for the more knowing DJ. The kind of variety that in more innocent times we would have cheerfully labelled Balearic. </p> <p>There's been a lot of British media excitement about Miami recently: the majority of the British dance-music establishment goes there every year to cut deals at the annual Winter Music Conference, so it's thought there must be a story in it. There is, but sadly not one anyone chooses to report. Musically Miami was largely moribund this year, making remixes of Eddie Grant's old pop-reggae chestnut Electric Avenue the toast of the town's clubs. A dire thing indeed - expect it to be duly massive this summer. </p> <p>One Miami night that has survived the hype and consistently championed new, exciting music is Magic Session, which is run by a trio of New York club-scene luminaries: Masters at Work's Louie Vegas, Tony Humphries and the criminally underrated producer Tedd Patterson. The Magic Sessions compilation gives a flavour of the night, mixing together classics such as Louie's ex-wife India's early 1980s club classic Love &amp; Happiness with more modern manifestos from Tedd himself and Louie's production partner Kenny \"Dope\" Gonzales. It also includes former home-counties junglist turned born-again old-skool house revivalist Photek. </p> <p>You'd be unlikely to choose Frankfurt as your holiday destination, but the city has given us a steady stream of house and techno over the years. Hypercity brings together 15 tracks from the redoubtable Force Tracks label mixed by one Andrew Weatherall, who, despite a lower profile than in his long-haired, leather-trousered glory days, remains a superb DJ. Once the warm-up DJ at original acid house den Shoom, elevated to producing and DJing for Screamadelica- era Primal Scream, then promoter of cheesy rave-free techno at his assault course of a club, Sabresonic, Weatherall is now a revered elder statesman of dance. He lends this collection of bleeps and minor chord minimalism somewhat more gravitas than it might otherwise have received. Buy it and earn the respect of every techno lad on your street.</p>",

It is not an earth-shattering piece, especially when compared with the stage works, Lucio Silla and Mitridate, that preceded it; the ceremonial circumstances of its premiere precluded any searching characterisation or dramatic tension. Instead, there is a series of decorative arias, functional recitative and a couple of choruses, which, if not by Mozart, would hardly merit more than the occasional airing. This is a more or less stylish and generally attractive period performance, sometimes a little too ornate in its decorations; the tenor Bruce Ford as Scipio and the soprano Christine Brandes are the pick of the cast. </p> <p><strong> Rossini: Le Nozze di Teti; Il Pianto d'Armonia </strong> <br> Bartoli/Florez/Kelly/Scano/ Orchestra e Core Filarmonico della Scala/Chailly <br> (Decca) **** <br> \u00a313.99 <br></p> <p> Rossini began his series of dramatic cantatas while still a student and used the form to perfect many of the theatrical devices he later employed in his operas. Il Pianto d'Armonia was the first, written for an end-of-year concert at the music school in Bologna in 1808, but of the two works in this second of Decca's series, Le Nozze di Teti is the more substantial piece. All of the singing is top class, but there are no prizes for guessing the star of the show. It's hard to believe that Decca would have embarked on these recordings were it not for the presence of Cecilia Bartoli in their stable, together with the bonus of Riccardo Chailly, whose Rossini conducting is consistently alert and energised. The mezzo-soprano is in vivacious form in Le Nozze di Teti, which includes an aria that Rossini was to recycle as one of the lollipops in La Cenerentola, and Bartoli turns it into a showstopper here, too. </p> <p><strong> Henze: Three Symphonic Studies; Quattro Poemi; Nachst\u00fccke und Arien; La Selva Incantata </strong> <br> Kaune/NDR Symphony/Ruzicka <br> Wergo **** <br> \u00a313.99 <br></p> <p> Hans Werner Henze left his native Germany to settle in Italy in 1953, and his musical world changed radically. His ambivalent attitude to his homeland in the aftermath of the second world war had acquired a musical dimension, too, as Henze found himself increasingly alienated from the radicalism of his contemporaries. In his new sunlit Mediterranean surroundings, away from the polemics of the avant-garde, the expressive warmth and lyricism that were his natural musical instincts could really express themselves. </p> <p>This collection of orchestral works, all first recordings, focuses upon the period in which Henze worked towards that new voice. Most revealing of all is arguably the least successful piece on the disc - the Three Symphonic Studies for large orchestra, completed in 1956 but revised eight years later, show Henze trying to reconcile his desire to make the orchestra sing with a lingering necessity to organise the music in a serial fashion. The results are rather Bergian, yet never quite in focus. </p> <p>In the orchestral Quattro Poemi from 1955, however, it is Schoenberg who is the main model; there is a freewheeling chromaticism about the harmony, and the intricate, singing lines that well up among the busy counterpoints create a pithy, potently dramatic world. </p> <p>But the most important piece here is undoubtedly Nachtst\u00fccke und Arien, the substantial 1957 settings of poems by Henze's then regular librettist Ingeborg Bachmann (who died in 1973). It is the work whose sense of Mediterranean warmth and lushness really put clear ground between Henze and his European contemporaries, who regarded such a frankly melodic work as unspeakably reactionary, with the result that, at the premiere in Darmstadt, Boulez, Stockhausen and Nono walked out during the performance. </p> <p>All bridges had finally been burned; but now, more than 40 years on, in a much less dogmatic age, it is possible to appreciate Nachstucke und Arien for what it is: a work permeated with the threat of catastrophe (made explicit in the two Bachmann texts, imposingly delivered on the recording by the soprano Michaela Kaune), yet one that is determined to sing raptly and theatrically in the face of that impending disaster. It is one of Henze's finest achievements. </p> <p>The key work from this period of his development, though, remains unrecorded. The huge opera King Stag, based upon a play by Gozzi, was the score through which Henze definitively found that new radiant voice, and enabled him to write with the freedom he found in Nachst\u00fccke und Arien. Stagings of the complete, five-hour work have been rare, too, and perhaps for that reason in 1991, Henze arranged two numbers from King Stag for the concert hall. La Selva Incantata is described as an aria and rondo for orchestra, and the music shows graphically how vivid and dramatically intense the world he created for the opera is; how it moves with such sureness, and how melodic lines burgeon and flower along the way. It is ravishing music, and though this recording is not the last word in allure, the performance by the South West German Radio Orchestra under Peter Ruzicka makes its glories plain to hear.</p>",

Not so with Glasgow quintet Mogwai, who seemed to have missed their chance, too busy messing about with tangential, flabby doodles to compose songs. But Rock Action has shifted Mogwai's goalposts. They could still do with a rip-roaring chorus, if only to dispel the suspicion that they remain incapable of writing one. However, Mogwai are beginning to see the bigger picture. Rock Action is at its best at its bookends. The opening Sine Wave is a hypnotic instrumental, swimming in Spiritualized-esque melody, while the closer, Secret Pint, led by Barry Burns's metronomic piano, is Erik Satie as a Tortoise acolyte. In between, Super Furry Animal Gruff Rhys sings Dial: Revenge in distracted fashion and a cunningly deployed string section gives 2 Rights Make 1 Wrong a grandeur that Mogwai previously shied away from. This year's dinner-party soundtrack? Don't bet your Dido disc against it. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Brian Eno and J Peter Schwalm </strong> Drawn from Life <br>(Virgin Venture) *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> These are busy times for Brian Eno, on one hand settling commercial scores with production duties for U2 and James, on the other hooking up with yet another musical partner to hitch a ride further into the ambient hinterland. J Peter Schwalm is a conservatory-trained German percussionist, but there is little percussion (and even that is played by Heiko Himmighoffen) on this gentle, sometimes sterile album. Eno prefers to utilise Schwalm's talents as a co-composer and mixer. The pair bring a serenity to Nell Catchpole's vigorous strings on Persis and subtly leaven Laurie Anderson's booming voice on Like Pictures Part \u00a32, while children's voices bring welcome humanity to Bloom. Towards the end, some childish jiggery-pokery involving two lengthy silences rather undermines the pair's thoughtful approach, but for the most part Drawn from Life is beguiling. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Natacha Atlas</strong> Ayeshteni <br>(Mantra) **** <br> \u00a312.99<br> </p> <p> Welcome to the queen of the new north African cool. Natacha Atlas has spent the past decade perfecting her own brand of contemporary Arabic pop, first as the belly-dancing vocalist with the multicultural Transglobal Underground and then on a series of solo albums. With Ayeshteni, she promises to extend her success beyond Egypt and France (where she is a major star) to Britain, where she once lived. The formula is simple and wildly effective. Her sensual vocals are mixed with sturdy, contemporary bass and drum rhythm tracks, and the swirling strings and wailing horns of some of the finest players in Cairo. The result is an Arabic fusion that is passionate and exhilarating. There's just one track here in English - an Egyptian update of the Jay Hawkins and Nina Simone classic, I Put a Spell on You - and a couple in French, including a breathy treatment of Jacques Brel's Ne Me Quitte Pas. The sparse remix track by Nitin Sawhney is a mistake, but can be forgiven after an album this original and impressive. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Marvin Gaye</strong> What's Going On <br>(Motown Deluxe, 2 CDs) ***** <br> \u00a316.99<br> </p> <p> While no amount of additional material could improve on the perfection of Marvin Gaye's 30-year-old masterpiece of conscious soul music, this expanded two-CD edition encourages a re-examination of his pioneering work. On the first disc, reissue producer Harry Weinger follows a remastered version of the original release - only 36 minutes long - with a complete bare-bones mix sent from the Motown studios in Detroit, where the basic tracks and lead vocals had been cut, to Hollywood, where Gaye and his engineer, Lawrence Miles, added the touches that created the mood of exotic paranoia that so transfixed listenersin the summer of 1971. But the true discovery, on the second disc, is a full 50-minute concert from the Kennedy Center in Washington on May 1, 1972. His native city was celebrating Marvin Gaye Day and the singer turned up, immaculately stoned, to perform the album's songs and a sprawling medley of his 1960s hits with a full orchestra driven by Motown's first-choice rhythm section: Robert White on guitar, James Jamerson on bass, Uriel Jones on drums, the percussionists Eddie \"Bongo\" Brown and Jack Ashford, and Gaye himself at the piano. Marvin rambles in his introductions, starts songs in the wrong place, and generally gives us a series of clues to the tragedy lying in wait 10 years down the road. But he also sounds utterly wonderful, reminding us of what someone once said about Miles Davis, that his mistakes were more interesting than most people's successes. When he stops the orchestra to make a minute adjustment to the groove of Inner City Blues, we hear the battle between indiscipline and precision that gave his music its special spirit. (RW) </p> <p><strong> Stevie Nicks </strong> Trouble in Shangri-La <br>(Reprise) *** <br> \u00a315.99<br> </p> <p> Stevie Nicks decided long ago who she was and has stuck with that ever since. Her constancy elicits both admiration (where does one buy white platform boots in 2001?) and impatience - does she never tire of maintaining the hippie-witch archetype she's cultivated since the 1970s? This is her first album in seven years and, despite the modern presence of Macy Gray on the bubbling Bombay Sapphires, nothing much has changed in Nicks's hermetic world. She boasts on Candlebright of being \"something of a dreamer\", and her husky warble still sketches dreamscapes of sea, sky and wizards to a soft-rock backdrop co-produced by Sheryl Crow. A foray into country on Too Far from Texas counts as a daring diversion. All that's missing is the subtle something that made Rooms on Fire so luscious. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Autechre </strong> Confield<br> (Warp) *** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> The twitching electronica of Autechre (Sean Booth and Rob Brown) doesn't really survive in the background. It's like having spiders crawling on your brain. But the unpredictability of the music, while agitating on the horizon, becomes agile and thrilling heard on headphones - it's like being able to track individual snowflakes in a blizzard. There are no tunes or obvious grooves and few recognisable instruments. But what leaps out of every track is a frenetic storm of tiny beats, a microscopic violence of ball-bearing clicks and scrapes. The strange sampled snoring on Uviol and the squashed voices on Lentic Cathachresis show a sort of strangled humanity, but the final information overload is more like being ejected from an android's bad dream. (PW) </p> <p><strong> Orbital </strong> The Altogether <br>(London/ffrr) **** <br> \u00a315.99<br> </p> <p> In 11 years of regular releases, Orbital haven't put a foot wrong. By their own admission, this is their happy album, running on a different fuel from the dark Insides or the politically charged Snivilisation. Less tied by thematic threads, The Altogether ranges far and wide in style and sometimes misses that earlier intensity. Pay Per View is attractive but undistinctive and Illuminate, sung by David Gray, feels slightly oversweet, as if they've stripped too much of themselves away to accompany the voice. But on Tension, Tootled and Dr Who there is still plenty of their grace under pressure. Dr Who gets a dramatic update with eerie feedback and tough beats. And oi! (sampling Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick with a bumpy Euro beat) shows Orbital's skill at making a tune appear to move forward and stand still at the same time. Few people can make you think and dance in such equal measure. (PW)</p>",

The pair bring a serenity to Nell Catchpole's vigorous strings on Persis and subtly leaven Laurie Anderson's booming voice on Like Pictures Part \u00a32, while children's voices bring welcome humanity to Bloom. Towards the end, some childish jiggery-pokery involving two lengthy silences rather undermines the pair's thoughtful approach, but for the most part Drawn from Life is beguiling. (JA) Natacha Atlas Ayeshteni (Mantra) **** \u00a312.99 Welcome to the queen of the new north African cool. Natacha Atlas has spent the past decade perfecting her own brand of contemporary Arabic pop, first as the belly-dancing vocalist with the multicultural Transglobal Underground and then on a series of solo albums. With Ayeshteni, she promises to extend her success beyond Egypt and France (where she is a major star) to Britain, where she once lived. The formula is simple and wildly effective. Her sensual vocals are mixed with sturdy, contemporary bass and drum rhythm tracks, and the swirling strings and wailing horns of some of the finest players in Cairo. The result is an Arabic fusion that is passionate and exhilarating. There's just one track here in English - an Egyptian update of the Jay Hawkins and Nina Simone classic, I Put a Spell on You - and a couple in French, including a breathy treatment of Jacques Brel's Ne Me Quitte Pas. The sparse remix track by Nitin Sawhney is a mistake, but can be forgiven after an album this original and impressive. (RD) Marvin Gaye What's Going On (Motown Deluxe, 2 CDs) ***** \u00a316.99 While no amount of additional material could improve on the perfection of Marvin Gaye's 30-year-old masterpiece of conscious soul music, this expanded two-CD edition encourages a re-examination of his pioneering work. On the first disc, reissue producer Harry Weinger follows a remastered version of the original release - only 36 minutes long - with a complete bare-bones mix sent from the Motown studios in Detroit, where the basic tracks and lead vocals had been cut, to Hollywood, where Gaye and his engineer, Lawrence Miles, added the touches that created the mood of exotic paranoia that so transfixed listenersin the summer of 1971. But the true discovery, on the second disc, is a full 50-minute concert from the Kennedy Center in Washington on May 1, 1972. His native city was celebrating Marvin Gaye Day and the singer turned up, immaculately stoned, to perform the album's songs and a sprawling medley of his 1960s hits with a full orchestra driven by Motown's first-choice rhythm section: Robert White on guitar, James Jamerson on bass, Uriel Jones on drums, the percussionists Eddie \"Bongo\" Brown and Jack Ashford, and Gaye himself at the piano. Marvin rambles in his introductions, starts songs in the wrong place, and generally gives us a series of clues to the tragedy lying in wait 10 years down the road. But he also sounds utterly wonderful, reminding us of what someone once said about Miles Davis, that his mistakes were more interesting than most people's successes. When he stops the orchestra to make a minute adjustment to the groove of Inner City Blues, we hear the battle between indiscipline and precision that gave his music its special spirit. (RW) Stevie Nicks Trouble in Shangri-La (Reprise) *** \u00a315.99 Stevie Nicks decided long ago who she was and has stuck with that ever since. Her constancy elicits both admiration (where does one buy white platform boots in 2001?) and impatience - does she never tire of maintaining the hippie-witch archetype she's cultivated since the 1970s? This is her first album in seven years and, despite the modern presence of Macy Gray on the bubbling Bombay Sapphires, nothing much has changed in Nicks's hermetic world. She boasts on Candlebright of being \"something of a dreamer\", and her husky warble still sketches dreamscapes of sea, sky and wizards to a soft-rock backdrop co-produced by Sheryl Crow. A foray into country on Too Far from Texas counts as a daring diversion. All that's missing is the subtle something that made Rooms on Fire so luscious. (CS) Autechre Confield (Warp) *** \u00a311.99 The twitching electronica of Autechre (Sean Booth and Rob Brown) doesn't really survive in the background. It's like having spiders crawling on your brain. But the unpredictability of the music, while agitating on the horizon, becomes agile and thrilling heard on headphones - it's like being able to track individual snowflakes in a blizzard. There are no tunes or obvious grooves and few recognisable instruments. But what leaps out of every track is a frenetic storm of tiny beats, a microscopic violence of ball-bearing clicks and scrapes. The strange sampled snoring on Uviol and the squashed voices on Lentic Cathachresis show a sort of strangled humanity, but the final information overload is more like being ejected from an android's bad dream. (PW) Orbital The Altogether (London/ffrr) **** \u00a315.99 In 11 years of regular releases, Orbital haven't put a foot wrong. By their own admission, this is their happy album, running on a different fuel from the dark Insides or the politically charged Snivilisation. Less tied by thematic threads, The Altogether ranges far and wide in style and sometimes misses that earlier intensity. Pay Per View is attractive but undistinctive and Illuminate, sung by David Gray, feels slightly oversweet, as if they've stripped too much of themselves away to accompany the voice. But on Tension, Tootled and Dr Who there is still plenty of their grace under pressure. Dr Who gets a dramatic update with eerie feedback and tough beats. And oi! (sampling Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick with a bumpy Euro beat) shows Orbital's skill at making a tune appear to move forward and stand still at the same time. Few people can make you think and dance in such equal measure. (PW)",

That's how you investigate.\" Guy Pearce, in his first good part since LA Confidential's similarly dogged tec, is an insurance investigator piecing together the murder of his wife. The unique aspect to this case is that he is hampered by being unable to amass new memories since a blow on the head at the murder scene incapacitated him. Original murder plots get ever harder to invent, but this is a corker, almost as good as DOA (poisoned man tries to solve own murder). Writer-director Christopher Nolan succeeds Following - an award-winner like this - with an even more tortuous and tricky tale that demands a second viewing. Pearce's desperate hunt, put together by notes, Polaroids and tattoos leaves him uniquely open to exploitation and Nolan makes it that much more paranoid by telling the whole tale backwards. Another director would make this unbearably trendy and tricksy but Nolan keeps it comprehensible and riveting: at 31, he's clearly a talent to watch. The result is a fiendishly complicated and ambiguous twist on the noir/detective genre with a sideline meditation on memory, intuition and trust. The Polaroid, a hopeless blur turning gradually into a crisp image is the perfect metaphor for Nolan's tale but if this makes the film sound terribly abstract and intellectual, I would be doing it a disservice: it may be labyrinthine and deeply obsessive but it's also thoroughly absorbing, with shafts of dark wit leavening its gloomier aspects.</p> <p><strong> Coyote Ugly</strong> <br>Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) Buena Vista Cert 12 ** </p> <p>A Jerry Bruckheimer film and, as that often implies, a film that relates only to other films. \"Flashdance meets Cocktail\" is the pretty accurate summary on the front of the sleeve.

A wish-fulfilment fantasy fluffier than a poodle in an angora bodywarmer, it tells of a songwriter with stage fright who leaves a small town to pursue her dreams, meets with rejection in the big city (New York) and ends up as a sexy dancing barmaid battling with new boyfriend and tough boss. It's hyper throughout and feels like a film written by a 14-year-old and directed by his younger brother. It is saved from total redundancy by a charming lead performance by Piper Perabo - looking strikingly like Sarah Jessica Parker in LA Story - and some enthusiastic direction: the Coyote bar as sexually charged moshpit is fun to watch, in an exhausting kind of way.

It's constructed largely as a flashback to how our anti-hero, Neil Fitzmaurice, got involved in a life of crime. The actor, who was DJ Ray Von in Peter Kay's recent Phoenix Nights series, also wrote the screenplay, and comes up with some nice lines: \"He was more Stringfellow than Goodfella.\" The film is far stronger in its prison scenes, where Bernard Hill is the old lag helping our youth get by in a Fletch-and-Lennie kind of way. You miss Hill in the more mundane scenes on the outside, though a fight in a bouncy castle and drug deals done from an ice-cream van are nicely original touches.

The \"count me in\" census campaign has come under fire for using the Sooty puppet character without permission. Gullane Entertainment's joint venture company, Sooty Limited, owns the worldwide copyright to the characters Sooty, Sweep, Soo and Cousin Scampi. But the Central Office of Information did not seek permission from Gullane to use a Sooty puppet in its campaign to encourage people to fill in their census forms. In one poster, a woman with a baby on her lap is pictured holding a Sooty glove puppet. Lawyers for Gullane have written to the COI demanding an immediate response about the use of Sooty in the campaign. Helen Byrne, Gullane's group head of business affairs, wrote in the letter: \"We are not aware the COI has made any approach to us to obtain our permission to use the character Sooty in this way.\" Related stories 26.04.2001: Labour's 172 advertising campaigns",

      "body": "<p><strong>happyclappy</strong><br> How will you meet demands for new affordable housing for teachers, nurses, police and social workers? The south-east is now a no-go area. Large increases in salaries would be the most sensible solution, but I don't suppose you're prepared to consider that... </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford</strong><br> Our starter home initiative backed by \u00a3250m will give help to teachers, nurses, police and other key workers. The scheme is designed to help the key workers buy a home in high-cost areas without adding to house price inflation. The likely impact of large salary increases would almost certainly be a runaway increase in house price inflation. </p> <p><strong>SusanJones</strong><br> What about other low-paid workers? Why is support being given to just those who happen to work in the public sector rather than all people who simply can't afford to buy in the south-east? </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford</strong><br> The Starter Homes Initiative is designed to help key workers but we have also substantially increased investment in affordable housing for other people in need. Investment through local councils has more than doubled since 1997, and over the next two years we plan to almost double investment through housing associations. Our aim is to ensure a good supply of houses available for sale and for rent to meet the full range of needs. In areas where there is very heavy pressure for housing, such as London and the south-east of England, it will inevitably take longer for our policies and increased investment to deliver the improvements that we know are needed and to which we are committed. However we are determined to continue on the lines spelt out in last years housing policy statement with no return to the disasterous policies of the previous Tory government that created boom-bust cycles, repossessions, negative equity and chronic under investment in social housing. </p> <p><strong>DCH11 </strong><br> It seems the government generally thinks that \"public is bad, private is good\" and are pursuing privatisation across the board. </p> <p>Opposition is growing - have you seen the Manifesto for Council Housing jointly sponsored by Defend Council Housing, TAROE (Tenants &amp; Residents Organisation of England), Daylight Robbery Campaign, UCATT, UNISON and GMB? </p> <p>The aim is to get tenants and union reps, MPs and councillors and candidates from all the parties to 'sign up' to this Manifesto... Use it in your area in the run up to the election, speakers available on request... Details at http://www.defendcouncilhousing.org.uk/ </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford</strong><br> Council housing has an important role to play in meeting housing needs and that is why the government has more than doubled the funds available to councils to modernise and improve council housing. We do not however believe in monopolies and so we are encouraging greater diversity in social housing. This means increasing the number of homes provided by other social landlords including housing associations and tenant co-operatives. Our objective, as spelt out in last year's housing policy statement is a high-quality social housing sector with a range of providers ensuring more choice for the public. </p> <p><strong>paulmason2000</strong><br> Why are you so determined to push the private finance initiative - hasn't it been proven overpriced and inefficient compared to traditional public spending? </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford</strong><br> The PFI has a role to play in housing as in other public services. Well-planned PFI schemes can deliver better value for money than traditional procurement routes because the contractor has to maintain the property for the lifetime of the contract and so has a vested interest in ensuring that it is well built and is cost effective to run. This helps also to achieve the government's objective of getting lifetime value rather than simply thinking about the capital cost of a project at the point of time it is built. However, the PFI will only be one element in the range of options available to local councils when considering how best to improve their housing stock. There are a number of other options. </p> <p><strong>johnkw </strong><br> The DETR is currently funding a pilot tenancy deposit scheme to overcome the problems of the non-return of rent deposits. If the pilot shows that the scheme works well, but that rogue landlords are not signing up on a voluntary basis, will the next Labour government legislate for a compulsory scheme? <br><strong>Bowlercork </strong><br> The tenancy deposit scheme pilot is working in some areas but take up and interest in others is very poor. Is it really viable to consider the introduction of a compulsory scheme, and how could it be policed. <br><strong>JoshE </strong><br> The government is currently running a pilot tenancy deposit scheme. How serious is it about making it compulsory if private landlords don't play along and join the trial? </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford </strong><br> There have been a number of questions about the tenancy deposit scheme to which I will give this single answer. Many tenants have difficulty in getting their deposit money back at the end of the tenancy and there is considerable scope for dispute between landlords and tenants on this subject. That is why we are piloting a number of tenancy deposit schemes to test ways of giving both tenants and landlords greater certainty and a fair means of resolving disputes. In some of the pilot areas tenant's deposits are held by the landlord or the landlords agent but with safeguards to ensure that they will be returned at the end of the tenancy assuming there are no outstanding debts owed by the tenant. In other areas the deposit is held independently by a third party. In both cases disputes that may arise can be resolved by the independent housing ombudsman. Both pilot schemes are generally working well and we will be evaluating them before deciding how to take forward this initiative across the whole country. Our aim is to do this on a voluntary basis, but we have not ruled out the possibility of a mandatory scheme if voluntary measures fail.</p> <p><strong>EwanMc </strong><br> As the government's planning policy guidance notes make clear, the planning system has to balance the (sometimes competing) interests of developers, local people, and the environment. But isn't the UK system rather weighted in favour of the developer, especially where that developer has a lot of money to spend? </p> <p>Suppose, for example, that a council is faced with an application that is locally unpopular. As I understand it, if the application is \"granted\", there is no third-party right of appeal, and the decision is unlikely to be \"called in\" (reviewed) by the secretary of state. </p> <p>But if the application is \"refused\", the developer can appeal, and even if it loses the appeal, it can keep resubmitting the application. Since dealing with applications and appeals is a costly process for councils, this can allow large developers to put significant financial pressure on the council to accept the application. In George Monbiot's book Captive State, he describes a planning inquiry in which a council's expert witnesses and legal representation were partially paid for by a developer which had a financial interest in the outcome of the inquiry (pp 134-140). </p> <p>Now, I have no personal knowledge of whether this case occurred as described (a planning officer friend of mine says that it would be very irregular). However, since the conflict of interest here is plain, it seems clear that it \"ought\" to be illegal, even if it isn't now. So could you clear this up for me? If it is illegal then I will try to find out what was happening in the case Mr Monbiot described. If it isn't, then I'd like to know why not. </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford </strong><br> Our planning system seeks to achieve a balance between a number of interests including economic development, protection of the environment and the provision of necessary social infrastructure. Councils are required to consider planning applications in the light of policies set out in their local plans. The public must be consulted during the preparation of plans and those affected by individual planning applications should be notified so they can comment on them. These rules are designed to ensure that the public interest is taken fully into account. Mr Monbiot's book is riddled with errors and half truths and is not a reliable source. Your planning officer friend is certainly right to say the scenario described is \"very irregular\".</p> <p><strong>detr1</strong><br> I am undertaking some independent research for a home improvement agency regarding client satisfaction. Foundations have advised me there is no national research on this topic and that no DETR standards exist. Is this likely to change? </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford </strong><br> The government funds Foundations as the national coordinating body for home improvement agencies (HIAs). Foundations will be issuing guidance later this year on the collection of data with regard to client satisfaction. Also under our Supporting People scheme, which will begin in 2003, local authorities will be expected to review the services that are provided including those offered by HIAs.</p> <p><strong>daviddent </strong><br> Shepherds Bush housing association has traditionally kept rent levels and increases low in an area of very high values. Our calculations show that we will need to increase some rents by \u00a340 over a 20-year period to achieve target. Is it your intention to force upon tenants increases of this order over 20 years or can SBHA have confirmation that the minister will expect the Housing Corporation to grant a waiver to allow increases to be reduced over such a period of time in high value areas? </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford</strong><br> Almost everyone agrees that the existing pattern of rents in the social housing sector needs reform. Rent levels are often arbitrary and bare little or no relationship to the quality or popularity of the home. Indeed in many areas single bedroom housing association properties are more expensive than two or three bedroom homes as highlighted on SocietyGuardian.co.uk. Our new proposals will create a fairer and more coherant pattern of rents for tenants of housing associations and local councils while ensuring that rent levels remain affordable as a safeguard we have made it clear that no single tenants rent will be increased or decreased by more than \u00a32 a week as a result of rent restructuring. There has been a great deal of ill-informed scare mongering about the impact of our rent proposals and I can assure readers that the government is utterly committed to ensuring that rents remain affordable while creating a much fairer pattern of rents throughout the country. </p> <p><strong>Lusby100 </strong><br> Will you stand up for your constituents in Greenwich who wish to see the dome re-open as a unique visitor attraction which will add to the prestige and character of Greenwich? </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford</strong><br> I can assure my constituents in Greenwich that I will continue to work for the regeneration of areas such as the Greenwich peninsula where the dome is located. The government will be looking to ensure the most appropriate long-term use of the dome and surrounding areas, and will also to continue to drive ahead with the millennium village which is already providing high quality homes for rent and for sale. The transformation of what was previously derelict and heavily polluted wilderness into a very attractive new place for people to live and work is one of this government's achievements of which I am most proud. </p> <p> <strong>DCH11 </strong><br> Nick Raynsford says the government guarantees a \"level playing field\" debate over housing privatisation. </p> <p>1. When is he going to offer equal resources to tenants opposed to privatisation to enable us to debate on equal terms with the the glossy PR campaigns run by local authorities and their consultants costing hundreds of thousands of pounds taken out of our rent money? </p> <p>2. When tenants vote against privatisation and to stay with the council why won't he respect this decision and allow councils \"equal rights\" to finance investment on terms available to registered social landlords? </p> <p>3. Having now proposed that arms' length companies will remain council owned, secure tenancies, direct council employees and borrow through the council to the public loan board - why won't the government just agree to let council keep and invest in their own stock as most tenants want? </p> <p><strong>Nick Raynsford </strong><br> The government has made it clear that there are four options available to local councils and tenants when deciding the best future for council housing in their area. With the major repairs allowance introduced this month, councils now have more money and greater certainty to plan ahead for the repair and modernisation of their housing if they choose to retain it in council ownership. The arms-length company option will enable successful councils to have access to additional funds. PFI offers another route to secure additional finance while retaining council ownership of the stock. The LSVT option remains available to attract additional finance where properties are transferred to a registered social landlord. None of these options involve \"privatisation\". We encourage all councils to review these options and to consult tenants fully before reaching decisions on what is the best option for their area.

BUT, I understand that (a) will only be possible for existing properties in situations where both ALL leaseholders AND the freeholder support it, and that for (b) it will be necessary both to form a limited company - onerous in itself - and for that limited company to be the only one of its type for the property (what if a freeholder-friendly leaseholder gets in first?). </p> <p>If I'm correct then it strikes me that both proposals will be unworkable.

      "bodyText": "happyclappy How will you meet demands for new affordable housing for teachers, nurses, police and social workers? The south-east is now a no-go area. Large increases in salaries would be the most sensible solution, but I don't suppose you're prepared to consider that... Nick Raynsford Our starter home initiative backed by \u00a3250m will give help to teachers, nurses, police and other key workers. The scheme is designed to help the key workers buy a home in high-cost areas without adding to house price inflation. The likely impact of large salary increases would almost certainly be a runaway increase in house price inflation. SusanJones What about other low-paid workers? Why is support being given to just those who happen to work in the public sector rather than all people who simply can't afford to buy in the south-east? Nick Raynsford The Starter Homes Initiative is designed to help key workers but we have also substantially increased investment in affordable housing for other people in need. Investment through local councils has more than doubled since 1997, and over the next two years we plan to almost double investment through housing associations. Our aim is to ensure a good supply of houses available for sale and for rent to meet the full range of needs. In areas where there is very heavy pressure for housing, such as London and the south-east of England, it will inevitably take longer for our policies and increased investment to deliver the improvements that we know are needed and to which we are committed. However we are determined to continue on the lines spelt out in last years housing policy statement with no return to the disasterous policies of the previous Tory government that created boom-bust cycles, repossessions, negative equity and chronic under investment in social housing. DCH11 It seems the government generally thinks that \"public is bad, private is good\" and are pursuing privatisation across the board. Opposition is growing - have you seen the Manifesto for Council Housing jointly sponsored by Defend Council Housing, TAROE (Tenants &amp; Residents Organisation of England), Daylight Robbery Campaign, UCATT, UNISON and GMB? The aim is to get tenants and union reps, MPs and councillors and candidates from all the parties to 'sign up' to this Manifesto... Use it in your area in the run up to the election, speakers available on request... Details at http://www.defendcouncilhousing.org.uk/ Nick Raynsford Council housing has an important role to play in meeting housing needs and that is why the government has more than doubled the funds available to councils to modernise and improve council housing. We do not however believe in monopolies and so we are encouraging greater diversity in social housing. This means increasing the number of homes provided by other social landlords including housing associations and tenant co-operatives. Our objective, as spelt out in last year's housing policy statement is a high-quality social housing sector with a range of providers ensuring more choice for the public. paulmason2000 Why are you so determined to push the private finance initiative - hasn't it been proven overpriced and inefficient compared to traditional public spending? Nick Raynsford The PFI has a role to play in housing as in other public services. Well-planned PFI schemes can deliver better value for money than traditional procurement routes because the contractor has to maintain the property for the lifetime of the contract and so has a vested interest in ensuring that it is well built and is cost effective to run. This helps also to achieve the government's objective of getting lifetime value rather than simply thinking about the capital cost of a project at the point of time it is built. However, the PFI will only be one element in the range of options available to local councils when considering how best to improve their housing stock. There are a number of other options. johnkw The DETR is currently funding a pilot tenancy deposit scheme to overcome the problems of the non-return of rent deposits. If the pilot shows that the scheme works well, but that rogue landlords are not signing up on a voluntary basis, will the next Labour government legislate for a compulsory scheme? Bowlercork The tenancy deposit scheme pilot is working in some areas but take up and interest in others is very poor. Is it really viable to consider the introduction of a compulsory scheme, and how could it be policed. JoshE The government is currently running a pilot tenancy deposit scheme. How serious is it about making it compulsory if private landlords don't play along and join the trial? Nick Raynsford There have been a number of questions about the tenancy deposit scheme to which I will give this single answer. Many tenants have difficulty in getting their deposit money back at the end of the tenancy and there is considerable scope for dispute between landlords and tenants on this subject. That is why we are piloting a number of tenancy deposit schemes to test ways of giving both tenants and landlords greater certainty and a fair means of resolving disputes. In some of the pilot areas tenant's deposits are held by the landlord or the landlords agent but with safeguards to ensure that they will be returned at the end of the tenancy assuming there are no outstanding debts owed by the tenant. In other areas the deposit is held independently by a third party. In both cases disputes that may arise can be resolved by the independent housing ombudsman. Both pilot schemes are generally working well and we will be evaluating them before deciding how to take forward this initiative across the whole country. Our aim is to do this on a voluntary basis, but we have not ruled out the possibility of a mandatory scheme if voluntary measures fail. EwanMc As the government's planning policy guidance notes make clear, the planning system has to balance the (sometimes competing) interests of developers, local people, and the environment. But isn't the UK system rather weighted in favour of the developer, especially where that developer has a lot of money to spend? Suppose, for example, that a council is faced with an application that is locally unpopular. As I understand it, if the application is \"granted\", there is no third-party right of appeal, and the decision is unlikely to be \"called in\" (reviewed) by the secretary of state. But if the application is \"refused\", the developer can appeal, and even if it loses the appeal, it can keep resubmitting the application. Since dealing with applications and appeals is a costly process for councils, this can allow large developers to put significant financial pressure on the council to accept the application. In George Monbiot's book Captive State, he describes a planning inquiry in which a council's expert witnesses and legal representation were partially paid for by a developer which had a financial interest in the outcome of the inquiry (pp 134-140). Now, I have no personal knowledge of whether this case occurred as described (a planning officer friend of mine says that it would be very irregular). However, since the conflict of interest here is plain, it seems clear that it \"ought\" to be illegal, even if it isn't now. So could you clear this up for me? If it is illegal then I will try to find out what was happening in the case Mr Monbiot described. If it isn't, then I'd like to know why not. Nick Raynsford Our planning system seeks to achieve a balance between a number of interests including economic development, protection of the environment and the provision of necessary social infrastructure. Councils are required to consider planning applications in the light of policies set out in their local plans. The public must be consulted during the preparation of plans and those affected by individual planning applications should be notified so they can comment on them. These rules are designed to ensure that the public interest is taken fully into account. Mr Monbiot's book is riddled with errors and half truths and is not a reliable source. Your planning officer friend is certainly right to say the scenario described is \"very irregular\". detr1 I am undertaking some independent research for a home improvement agency regarding client satisfaction. Foundations have advised me there is no national research on this topic and that no DETR standards exist. Is this likely to change? Nick Raynsford The government funds Foundations as the national coordinating body for home improvement agencies (HIAs). Foundations will be issuing guidance later this year on the collection of data with regard to client satisfaction. Also under our Supporting People scheme, which will begin in 2003, local authorities will be expected to review the services that are provided including those offered by HIAs. daviddent Shepherds Bush housing association has traditionally kept rent levels and increases low in an area of very high values. Our calculations show that we will need to increase some rents by \u00a340 over a 20-year period to achieve target. Is it your intention to force upon tenants increases of this order over 20 years or can SBHA have confirmation that the minister will expect the Housing Corporation to grant a waiver to allow increases to be reduced over such a period of time in high value areas? Nick Raynsford Almost everyone agrees that the existing pattern of rents in the social housing sector needs reform. Rent levels are often arbitrary and bare little or no relationship to the quality or popularity of the home. Indeed in many areas single bedroom housing association properties are more expensive than two or three bedroom homes as highlighted on SocietyGuardian.co.uk. Our new proposals will create a fairer and more coherant pattern of rents for tenants of housing associations and local councils while ensuring that rent levels remain affordable as a safeguard we have made it clear that no single tenants rent will be increased or decreased by more than \u00a32 a week as a result of rent restructuring. There has been a great deal of ill-informed scare mongering about the impact of our rent proposals and I can assure readers that the government is utterly committed to ensuring that rents remain affordable while creating a much fairer pattern of rents throughout the country. Lusby100 Will you stand up for your constituents in Greenwich who wish to see the dome re-open as a unique visitor attraction which will add to the prestige and character of Greenwich? Nick Raynsford I can assure my constituents in Greenwich that I will continue to work for the regeneration of areas such as the Greenwich peninsula where the dome is located. The government will be looking to ensure the most appropriate long-term use of the dome and surrounding areas, and will also to continue to drive ahead with the millennium village which is already providing high quality homes for rent and for sale. The transformation of what was previously derelict and heavily polluted wilderness into a very attractive new place for people to live and work is one of this government's achievements of which I am most proud. DCH11 Nick Raynsford says the government guarantees a \"level playing field\" debate over housing privatisation. 1. When is he going to offer equal resources to tenants opposed to privatisation to enable us to debate on equal terms with the the glossy PR campaigns run by local authorities and their consultants costing hundreds of thousands of pounds taken out of our rent money? 2. When tenants vote against privatisation and to stay with the council why won't he respect this decision and allow councils \"equal rights\" to finance investment on terms available to registered social landlords? 3. Having now proposed that arms' length companies will remain council owned, secure tenancies, direct council employees and borrow through the council to the public loan board - why won't the government just agree to let council keep and invest in their own stock as most tenants want? Nick Raynsford The government has made it clear that there are four options available to local councils and tenants when deciding the best future for council housing in their area. With the major repairs allowance introduced this month, councils now have more money and greater certainty to plan ahead for the repair and modernisation of their housing if they choose to retain it in council ownership. The arms-length company option will enable successful councils to have access to additional funds. PFI offers another route to secure additional finance while retaining council ownership of the stock. The LSVT option remains available to attract additional finance where properties are transferred to a registered social landlord. None of these options involve \"privatisation\". We encourage all councils to review these options and to consult tenants fully before reaching decisions on what is the best option for their area. We strongly believe in giving tenants choice rather than insisting on one option only for ideological reasons.

      "byline": "Peter Hetherington",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1997, John Prescott was asked by a northern Labour MP to review the distribution of cash around the UK, and he had no hesitation in replying that it was \"necessary to make sure we have a level playing field\". There was little reaction from cabinet colleagues. Yet the same statement of policy sent shock waves through Labour's high command when repeated rather more robustly this week. </p> <p>Four years ago even the then Treasury chief secretary, Alistair Darling, a Scottish MP, appeared to concede that the funding formula - conceived by Lord (Joel) Barnett in the mid-70s - was unsustainable, creating anything but that level playing field. Since, much has changed in the constitutional map of the UK. Scotland, with its own parliament and a spending-per-head level remaining stubbornly 23% above the English average, is going its own way. Wales (18% above), with a non-legislative assembly, is slowly flexing its muscles while Northern Ireland (39% above) is trying to make devolution stick. </p> <p>But now a bigger and potentially more disruptive constitutional re-think is taking place. Ministers, even those to whom regionalism was a policy that dare not speak its name, now recognise that an answer has to be found to the English constitutional question: namely, how to govern a country of 50m when the union designed to bind the other nations with England is under increasing strain. The UK is no longer a unified state and England anything but a stable unit. </p> <p>But ministers have yet to take the logical post-devolution step of addressing how government money should be distributed throughout the UK. The northern fringes of England are getting restless over a formula which seems to discriminate against them in health, education, roads and industrial support. Recognising that passions may soon be running high, Mr Prescott repeated this week that UK funding must be addressed sooner rather than later. Sensibly, he suggested it should be done alongside a forthcoming review of Whitehall's equally complex system for determining how grants are shared among town and county halls - based on a formula, known as the standard spending assessment (SSA). Some think this already discriminates against such counties as Northumberland and northern cities losing population. </p> <p>The SSA distributes around \u00a350bn and was designed to take account of the differing needs of local areas, compensating some poorer authorities through a variety of weightings. Council officials complain it is often too arbitrary and detailed. Why, for instance - even taking into account London's diverse cultural mix - should spending per pupil in Northumberland secondary schools be \u00a32,159 annually while, in Kensington and Chelsea, it stands at \u00a33,616? </p> <p>Mr Prescott, who desperately wants to reform council finance, recognises the dilemma. \"What has happened is that SSAs have been allowed to continue their disparities because no one wanted to say 'you're going to get more and you're going to get less here'... no one has done anything for years and just let (disparities) grow.\" His argument is that in reviewing the whole structure of council finance, it makes sense to make the exercise wider and consider funding for the wider regions, and nations of the UK. \"What we are developing is the framework of a decentralised UK and the structure within that is becoming reasonably clear,\" Mr Prescott says. \"But we haven't fixed it yet for the English regions and the financial structure, which has to be fair, is a question we haven't started on.\" </p> <p>One idea, punted by Blairite town hall reformers, is to fund say education and social services directly from the centre, providing common standards and spending levels, give or take a tweak or two, between Northumberland at one extreme and Kensington on the other (although a centrally funded NHS is still struggling against a postcode lottery to provide national health care standards). That, of course, does not answer the wider UK funding question. On the latest figures the north-east would need an extra \u00a31.1bn a year to catch up with Scottish spending, while Yorkshire - with a similar population to Scotland - would need \u00a35.2bn more and the south-east \u00a312.1bn. </p> <p>While it is tempting to look north of the border and argue for a redistribution of resources from Scotland to England, the Scots can justly claim that serving a generally sparsely populated country of many diverse regions and three large island groups, with a population concentrated in the Clyde-Forth central belt, does not come cheap. Glasgow, in spite of the Barnett formula and much higher council tax levels than English cities, remains the poorest city in Britain. </p> <p>Other services, like roads and transport, are clearly more expensive to provide, while water supply has never been privatised in Scotland and requires a hefty dollop from the public purse each year. And if the heat is turned on the Barnett formula, the Scottish lobby has one ace up its sleeve: the billions of pounds annually still flowing from North Sea oil fields to the exchequer. The last thing ministers want is a revival of \"it's Scotland's oil\" in the run-up to Scottish parliamentary elections in two years' time. So any review of Barnett may have to wait a little longer.

      "bodyText": "In 1997, John Prescott was asked by a northern Labour MP to review the distribution of cash around the UK, and he had no hesitation in replying that it was \"necessary to make sure we have a level playing field\". There was little reaction from cabinet colleagues. Yet the same statement of policy sent shock waves through Labour's high command when repeated rather more robustly this week. Four years ago even the then Treasury chief secretary, Alistair Darling, a Scottish MP, appeared to concede that the funding formula - conceived by Lord (Joel) Barnett in the mid-70s - was unsustainable, creating anything but that level playing field. Since, much has changed in the constitutional map of the UK. Scotland, with its own parliament and a spending-per-head level remaining stubbornly 23% above the English average, is going its own way. Wales (18% above), with a non-legislative assembly, is slowly flexing its muscles while Northern Ireland (39% above) is trying to make devolution stick. But now a bigger and potentially more disruptive constitutional re-think is taking place. Ministers, even those to whom regionalism was a policy that dare not speak its name, now recognise that an answer has to be found to the English constitutional question: namely, how to govern a country of 50m when the union designed to bind the other nations with England is under increasing strain. The UK is no longer a unified state and England anything but a stable unit. But ministers have yet to take the logical post-devolution step of addressing how government money should be distributed throughout the UK. The northern fringes of England are getting restless over a formula which seems to discriminate against them in health, education, roads and industrial support. Recognising that passions may soon be running high, Mr Prescott repeated this week that UK funding must be addressed sooner rather than later. Sensibly, he suggested it should be done alongside a forthcoming review of Whitehall's equally complex system for determining how grants are shared among town and county halls - based on a formula, known as the standard spending assessment (SSA). Some think this already discriminates against such counties as Northumberland and northern cities losing population. The SSA distributes around \u00a350bn and was designed to take account of the differing needs of local areas, compensating some poorer authorities through a variety of weightings. Council officials complain it is often too arbitrary and detailed. Why, for instance - even taking into account London's diverse cultural mix - should spending per pupil in Northumberland secondary schools be \u00a32,159 annually while, in Kensington and Chelsea, it stands at \u00a33,616? Mr Prescott, who desperately wants to reform council finance, recognises the dilemma. \"What has happened is that SSAs have been allowed to continue their disparities because no one wanted to say 'you're going to get more and you're going to get less here'... no one has done anything for years and just let (disparities) grow.\" His argument is that in reviewing the whole structure of council finance, it makes sense to make the exercise wider and consider funding for the wider regions, and nations of the UK. \"What we are developing is the framework of a decentralised UK and the structure within that is becoming reasonably clear,\" Mr Prescott says. \"But we haven't fixed it yet for the English regions and the financial structure, which has to be fair, is a question we haven't started on.\" One idea, punted by Blairite town hall reformers, is to fund say education and social services directly from the centre, providing common standards and spending levels, give or take a tweak or two, between Northumberland at one extreme and Kensington on the other (although a centrally funded NHS is still struggling against a postcode lottery to provide national health care standards). That, of course, does not answer the wider UK funding question. On the latest figures the north-east would need an extra \u00a31.1bn a year to catch up with Scottish spending, while Yorkshire - with a similar population to Scotland - would need \u00a35.2bn more and the south-east \u00a312.1bn. While it is tempting to look north of the border and argue for a redistribution of resources from Scotland to England, the Scots can justly claim that serving a generally sparsely populated country of many diverse regions and three large island groups, with a population concentrated in the Clyde-Forth central belt, does not come cheap. Glasgow, in spite of the Barnett formula and much higher council tax levels than English cities, remains the poorest city in Britain. Other services, like roads and transport, are clearly more expensive to provide, while water supply has never been privatised in Scotland and requires a hefty dollop from the public purse each year. And if the heat is turned on the Barnett formula, the Scottish lobby has one ace up its sleeve: the billions of pounds annually still flowing from North Sea oil fields to the exchequer. The last thing ministers want is a revival of \"it's Scotland's oil\" in the run-up to Scottish parliamentary elections in two years' time. So any review of Barnett may have to wait a little longer. Whether that will satisfy a restless English regional lobby is another matter.",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street was last night forced to mount a damage limitation exercise after it emerged that the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, was not party to the decision to spare Phoenix, the disease-free heifer, from the foot and mouth cull. Officials at No 10 and the Ministry of Agriculture were adamant that scientists rather than spin doctors were responsible for the policy shift - confirmed by Mr Brown yesterday - that eased the automatic cull of animals on neighbouring farms. But they were unable to explain how tabloid newspapers - which had been highlighting the plight of Phoenix, sole survivor of such a cull in Devon - appeared to know that the calf would be spared. Mr Brown was forced to concede that he had not been aware that Downing Street was going to announce that Phoenix was to be saved on Wednesday night, just in time for the main 10 o'clock news bulletins. \"You say they announced it. I don't know whether it is true or not.\" Godric Smith, deputy to Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's press secretary, yesterday stressed that the policy shift had been under discussion among scientists as early as last Friday; it had culminated in a chat between Mr Brown and Mr Blair on Wednesday afternoon. That version left open the view, widely shared by MPs, that Mr Campbell's eagle eye for a tabloid story ensured that the media was encouraged to jump the gun on Phoenix before the official machine had confirmed the shift. Downing Street's new chief scientist, Professor David King, who has taken an increasingly prominent media role, said yesterday that he and his committee of scientists and veterinarians advising Nick Brown had been discussing \"refinements\" of the mass cull policy for two or three weeks. New information had been gathered which suggested that slight changes to the policy of slaughtering all animals on farms next to infected cases were possible which could spare healthy animals kept in conditions where they did not threaten others. Professor King said: \"Phoenix has nothing to do with this announcement. It was based on independent advice by scientists.\" It was confirmed yesterday that four more people are being tested for suspected foot and mouth disease. Three others are already being tested.

Maybe his ghost still roosts there, invading the souls of nervy prime ministers from time to time. For the question now is whether Tony Blair in his second term will be more man and less chicken. As the manifesto takes shape with daily morsels released for public delectation, we wait still for a missing clarity of purpose.</p> <p>His first term saw moments of audacity, followed by rapid retreats, moments of clarity, fogged by third way obfuscation. Some remarkable good was done, but stealthily with a strange dislocation between words and actions, walking and talking in opposite directions. This chicken afraid of his own shadow leaves bemused onlookers wondering what phantoms frighten him that no one else can see. There is still time to seize the day, to be a really great prime minister.</p> <p>But this week saw a classic display of chicken politics. First the Financial Times was given an exclusive: the manifesto will again pledge no income tax rise in the next parliament, on prime ministerial orders. Read his lips, no increases in the fairest tax, (sotto voce: only unfair taxes by stealth). Within New Labour, the instant response has been extraordinary. I have rarely heard such a loud spontaneous shriek of pain from all round the centre-left, from within the party and from leading left-leaning think-tanks, among all kinds of solid supporters. Even some ministers joined Labour MPs groaning loudly, \"Oh no, oh God, surely not again?\"</p> <p>The usual compensatory zigzag came fast - very Blair, very chicken. To balance the FT story, the Guardian and Mirror get an exclusive (sort of) on the new baby bonds - the imaginative plan to give every poor child a trust fund, a slice of capital to send them on their way. It is indeed a good radical step in thinking about the nature of poverty, trying to give poor children some of the same support that middle-class children take for granted, a cushion of \u00a35,000 to \u00a37,000 as a stake in adult life. This idea, vigorously promoted by the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Fabians, has the added advantage of shaking off the Conservatives: Michael Portillo, who has trotted along every step of Labour's spending path, balked at this fence, dismissing it as a \"gimmick\" he would never implement - a cheap riposte that just leaves the Tories looking mean.</p> <p>These baby bonds do flag up the government's project to eliminate child poverty. Yesterday the chancellor pledged another million children will be lifted out by 2004, reaching half way towards total abolition, a remarkable endeavour. So why is the war on poverty still not really the true battle hymn of this government? Because they slip out of anything that risks defining them too clearly. For alas, there is no comparison in the defining importance of baby bonds versus a no-income-tax pledge. It is the big figures that tell the long-term story of who and what this government really is and means to be. Baby bonds will cost under \u00a31bn a year, while the 1p the chancellor took off income tax is costing \u00a32.5bn a year.</p> <p>One Treasury adviser protested vainly, yesterday: \"Look, this is not a litmus test\". How wrong he is. For many Labour voters, old and new, it is the litmus test. Numerically, the prime minister can thumb his nose at Labour voters. According to Bob Worcester of Mori, a great many deeply disaffected ones won't vote: expect the lowest ever turnout at 65%. But they all live in safe Labour seats, so never mind. Just one million voters will decide the final tally of seats - 20% waverers in the 20% seats that are marginal. Bribe, cajole and flatter these dithering, non-political, half-hearted dim-wits and Labour can keep the 35 MPs it might otherwise loose. That's what this income tax pledge is designed to do. Is it really worth it?</p> <p>But what else would this pledge do? It panders to a Conservative view of the world that all taxes are bad, all tax cuts good. It refuses to tell the basic truth that citizens get what they pay for. It denies that this is a disgracefully under-taxed country with multiple scars to prove it. It promises a quality of public service that will never be delivered until there is public consent for paying more. It needs strong leadership now to create enthusiasm for a long spell of social democratic government.</p> <p>We need progressive government for decades, through persuading people Britain need not be the shabbiest, most despised poor relation in Europe. Minor amelioration is not enough. Clinton's third way changed no hearts and minds, left no lasting monuments. Time and again, Blair ducks the decisive moment, chooses not to choose. One of the essential ingredients for his promised progressive century has to be proportional representation, but he shies off that one too. No prime minister in living memory ever had such luck or such a chance to raise the dismal aspirations of this country permanently. If not now in this manifesto, Mr Chicken, then when?</p> <p>From Millbank, the answer is deeply depressing - a gramophone record of yesteryear, fighting old elections and dead demons. \"New Labour reaches parts of the electorate Labour never reached before. That is the coalition we have to hold together. It would be a catastrophe if we assumed we had these voters in the bag. This tax pledge is about sending out a signal that we are not reverting to old Labour, not letting taxes go through the roof again.\"</p> <p>The income tax question isn't just a totemic old red battle flag, it is the important question. There are other ways of raising money - up to a point, though most have been used already. In the long term, there is no other way of raising the necessary funds fairly. The top rate is far too low. It may kick in at too low a level, but those on over \u00a350,000 and again at over \u00a3100,000 should be paying more. As for the fat cat bonuses galloping out of control, it even sickens the Daily Mail these days. In 1985 CEO pay was 25 times the pay of their blue collar workers. Now it is approaching 50 times. The wealth gap widens.</p> <p>Gordon Brown cannot call it prudent to tie his hands for the next five years. Entering a downturn that might turn nasty, there is nothing prudent about ruling out the most obvious way to pay for unexpected unemployment. The pledge was a fraud last time - tax did rise. With the abolition of mortgage, pension, and married couples tax reliefs, plus an increase in National Insurance, it was a sham and people will not believe it now. Since taxation rose 3% of GDP since 1997, it's time to come clean.</p> <p>In all this, there is no red thread, no trajectory, no story and no leadership. Local government has just been denied the right to levy a 5% business tax. The tube PPP ploughs on regardless. Mothers probably won't get the right to work part time: not business friendly, but business-terrified. A lot of good had been done, but without coherent political direction, there is no imagery. Even New Labour loyalists are dispirited. They just want their leader to do the right thing for its own sake, because he believes it, even if it's not popular. They know he can - look at Kosovo, Sierra Leone, or indeed child poverty. So why not on tax? There is still time to be a great prime minister. Or will it be Mr Chicken?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

As for the fat cat bonuses galloping out of control, it even sickens the Daily Mail these days. In 1985 CEO pay was 25 times the pay of their blue collar workers. Now it is approaching 50 times. The wealth gap widens. Gordon Brown cannot call it prudent to tie his hands for the next five years. Entering a downturn that might turn nasty, there is nothing prudent about ruling out the most obvious way to pay for unexpected unemployment. The pledge was a fraud last time - tax did rise. With the abolition of mortgage, pension, and married couples tax reliefs, plus an increase in National Insurance, it was a sham and people will not believe it now. Since taxation rose 3% of GDP since 1997, it's time to come clean. In all this, there is no red thread, no trajectory, no story and no leadership. Local government has just been denied the right to levy a 5% business tax. The tube PPP ploughs on regardless. Mothers probably won't get the right to work part time: not business friendly, but business-terrified. A lot of good had been done, but without coherent political direction, there is no imagery. Even New Labour loyalists are dispirited. They just want their leader to do the right thing for its own sake, because he believes it, even if it's not popular. They know he can - look at Kosovo, Sierra Leone, or indeed child poverty. So why not on tax? There is still time to be a great prime minister. Or will it be Mr Chicken? polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

As Mr Hague toured Bradford, Mr Townend described multiculturalism as a \"mistake [that] will inevitably cause great problems\". Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs called on Mr Hague to take the Tory whip from Mr Townend who sparked a furore over race last month when he lavished praise on Enoch Powell's infamous \"rivers of blood\" speech. Mr Hague condemned Mr Townend's remarks last night, but refused to take any action against him. Mr Townend provoked a new row when he released a copy of his letter to the commission for racial equality which outlines the reasons for his refusal to sign an anti-racism pact. Scores of Tory MPs have refused to sign, including the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo. In a letter to the CRE chairman, Gurbux Singh, the MP for Yorkshire East wrote: \"I think the CRE causes more racial problems than it solves. \"I believe in individual freedom and in equality before the law. I believe that as a result of some of your activities some people are more equal than others.\" In a separate statement, Mr Townend said Britain's ethnic minority communities should abandon their roots. \"This means that certainly from the second generation all immigrants should consider themselves as natives of this island, rather than looking back to a motherland abroad,\" he said. Mr Townend also rounded on Robin Cook's \"chicken tikka masala\" speech, in which the foreign secretary hailed Britain's varied communities. \"Presumably he considers us a mongrel race,\" the MP said.

The Official Secrets Act did not allow them to argue they revealed the information in the public interest, argued Nigel Sweeney QC. He was opening a pre-trial hearing at the high court where lawyers for the former MI5 officer will mount an unprecedented challenge to the secrets act. They argue it is incompatible with Britain's new Human Rights Act which entrenches in British law the European Convention on Human Rights, and so enshrines the principle of freedom of speech. It is the first time such a challenge has been made in the courts in Britain. Mr Sweeney acknowledged the signficance of the case, telling the judge, Alan Moses, that the court had a \"vital decision\" to make. Secrecy was essential to MI5 in its task in defence of the realm and \"all our liberties\", he insisted. He pointed out that the secrets act imposed a blanket duty of silence. Information about the security and intelligence agencies could be disclosed only with \"lawful authority\" - in other words, only with \"official authorisation\". If former or serving members of the security and intelligence agencies wanted to complain about the agencies' activities, they could report their concerns to their superiors, a staff counsellor, a complaints tribunal, the police, or even a minister, said Mr Sweeney. Mr Justice Moses intervened to say agency staff might want to go to \"somebody who is going to listen rather than someone who might be tainted - someone with independence of mind, a wise old bird with no ambitions\". Mr Sweeney earlier told the court that it was \"preposterous\" if the effect of the Human Rights Act was to make the criminal trial a \"voyage of discovery\" into untested realms of the law. The Official Secrets Act was \"plainly compatible\" with the Human Rights Act. The defence insists it is for the jury, not the judge in these pre-trial hearings, to decide on the adequacy of the complaints procedures now in place. It also argues it is for the jury to decide whether the criminal sanctions imposed by the secrets act meet the \"proportionality\" test used by the European court of human rights, as well as that court's other key criterion - whether the criminal sanctions are \"necessary in a democratic society\". The defence argues that the secrets act can apply only to \"lawful\" activities of the security and intelligence agencies, although the statute does not include the term lawful. The absolute offences laid down in the secrets act are a \"disproportionate response\" to a disclosure made in the public interest, the defence claims. At stake in the pre-trial hearing, which continues today, is the credibility of the secrets act. If Mr Shayler cannot be prosecuted under this act, say Whitehall officials, there is little point in it. Whoever loses as a result of Mr Moses' ruling is expected to appeal, leading to a delay in the trial almost certainly until after the general election. Before yesterday's high court hearing, Mr Shayler, 35, claimed that his case would \"put the British state on trial\". He added: \"They have chosen who to prosecute and who not to prosecute. It is totally arbitrary rule of law.\" Mr Shayler continued: \"We plan to subpoena Jack Straw and Robin Cook [the home and foreign secretaries] and it is quite obvious they don't want to answer questions in open court right before an election.\" Mr Shayler is charged with disclosing documents in 1997 to the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which published articles revealing that MI5 kept files on Labour ministers and rock bands, alleging incompetence within MI5, and disclosing how MI5 tapped phones and intercepted post. He is supported by the National Union of Journalists, whose members carried placards outside the court reading \"Blow that Whistle\" and \"Scrap the Official Secrets Act\".",

      "body": "<p>\"You and this city - may fate be merciful to you both and may you remember me with pleasure when I am dead.\" The words of Sophocles' Oedipus came easily to Giuseppe Sinopoli when he addressed Berlin and its opera house on his return to the city earlier this year. He was a true polymath. On Monday, the day of his funeral, he was due to be in Rome to receive a degree in Egyptology. But he was also a novelist, the author of a thesis on anthropology and an expert on criminal psychiatry, as well as a composer. Like an earlier Sicilian, the ruler Frederick II in the 13th century, Sinopoli could boast of Stupor Mundi status.</p> <p>A wonder, certainly, in Vienna, Bayreuth and Munich. But in London's musical world Sinopoli was a more awkward figure. He once called Britain an \"arrogant and miserable place\". And his habit of on-the-wing intellectualising, of mini-lectures on the psychology and history of music in mid-rehearsal, was here regarded as at best eccentric and at worst an obstacle.</p> <p>But Sinopoli's challenge poses a question beyond the confines of music. Why in boring Britain is the polymath regarded with such suspicion - as a flamboyant figure whose showiness conceals fraudulence - while the European cultural tradition continues to breed the genius who has depth as well as breadth?</p> <p>Britain's culture has become an affair of specialists - of people who know one thing and won't put heads above parapets for fear of offending other authorities. This is the country where that deadliest of specialists, the manager, has spread its tentacles furthest. There's a neat irony about the way in which a proudly empirical country has embraced a theory quite so unconsciously.

      "bodyText": "\"You and this city - may fate be merciful to you both and may you remember me with pleasure when I am dead.\" The words of Sophocles' Oedipus came easily to Giuseppe Sinopoli when he addressed Berlin and its opera house on his return to the city earlier this year. He was a true polymath. On Monday, the day of his funeral, he was due to be in Rome to receive a degree in Egyptology. But he was also a novelist, the author of a thesis on anthropology and an expert on criminal psychiatry, as well as a composer. Like an earlier Sicilian, the ruler Frederick II in the 13th century, Sinopoli could boast of Stupor Mundi status. A wonder, certainly, in Vienna, Bayreuth and Munich. But in London's musical world Sinopoli was a more awkward figure. He once called Britain an \"arrogant and miserable place\". And his habit of on-the-wing intellectualising, of mini-lectures on the psychology and history of music in mid-rehearsal, was here regarded as at best eccentric and at worst an obstacle. But Sinopoli's challenge poses a question beyond the confines of music. Why in boring Britain is the polymath regarded with such suspicion - as a flamboyant figure whose showiness conceals fraudulence - while the European cultural tradition continues to breed the genius who has depth as well as breadth? Britain's culture has become an affair of specialists - of people who know one thing and won't put heads above parapets for fear of offending other authorities. This is the country where that deadliest of specialists, the manager, has spread its tentacles furthest. There's a neat irony about the way in which a proudly empirical country has embraced a theory quite so unconsciously. The problem after all with being innocent of theory is that you tend not to notice when one big theory has got you in its grip. In our literature there's an envious suspicion of figures who think that art is parasitic on experience, and that curiosity should therefore be boundless. How could Anthony Burgess, so runs the complaint, manage to be simultaneously a novelist, composer and first-rate linguist? Nicholas Moseley has written some of the best post-1945 novels - but he is consistently under-estimated since his idiom is that of European fiction drawing on ideas in science and philosophy.

      "bodyText": "The Sunday Mirror's showbusiness writer, Ian Hyland, is to drop his weekly column to concentrate on TV reviews and celebrity interviews. The move is the second major change to be made by Tina Weaver, the former deputy of the Mirror, who last week replaced Colin Myler as editor of the Sunday paper. Ms Weaver is keen to stamp her personality on the Sunday Mirror. However, she will be working closely with the Mirror editor, Piers Morgan, to introduce a more co-ordinated editorial strategy. Mr Hyland picked up a Princess Margaret award earlier this week for Best Showbusiness Vendetta, honouring his long-running campaign against Victoria Beckham. In his Sunday Mirror column - which he has written for three years - he claimed Ms Beckham wore a wig on stage and that she had agreed to pose nude in Playboy with her husband. But Mr Hyland is believed to have grown tired of the column and is looking forward to writing more celebrity interviews. Last week he interviewed the acid-tongued Anne Robinson.

      "body": "<p>Cathy Kelly, Belfast born and Dublin reared, swearing like a trooper with a hangover, yesterday became the Parker romantic novelist of the year.</p> <p>Ms Kelly has achieved the romantic dream of every red blooded journalist.</p> <p>\"I was always saying I was going to write a book, and then I finally did, and then it went to number one on the bestseller list so I thought 'Jaysus, I'd better write another',\" she said.</p> <p>Her fifth novel, Someone Like You, yesterday took the \u00a35,000 prize, beating a shortlist of six, which included four previous winners and the grande dame of the trade, Rosamunde Pilcher.</p> <p>Ms Pilcher, with 60 years writing, 30 novels and a shelf of disowned Mills and Boon titles behind her, said Someone Like You was one of a handful among the hundreds of novels she is sent every year which she could bear to read beyond the first three pages.</p> <p>Alan Titchmarsh, celebrity gardener reborn as a romantic novelist, presented the prizes at the Savoy hotel in London.</p> <p>When Ms Pilcher started writing at 18, not only was sex unmentionable for her heroines, so were divorce, alcohol and even going to the races. \"Now one tries to hold the line between writing about more challenging subjects in a more modern way, and driving away a whole generation of older readers,\" she said.</p> <p>Ms Kelly's heroines are usually tottering under the influence of excesses of one kind or another - although her book ends with a kiss in a car. She knows that \"romantic novel\" is still a term of abuse in literary circles.</p> <p>But Norma Curtis, novelist and chairwoman of the Romantic Novelists' Association, said: \"You only have to sell about 2,000 books to get on the Booker shortlist. Our books start with a print run of 30,000.\"</p> <p>Sales of romantic novels are only beaten by crime fiction, and a survey in 1996 found that 182m copies had been sold world wide that year. \"Bridget Jones has really changed the market, with all the 20 and 30-year-olds coming in for the first time as readers and writers,\" Ms Curtis said.</p> <p>\"The younger writers' books are much more earthy - bollocks is a very popular word now - and the older readers won't go near them, although the younger readers will read the older books.\"</p> <p>Cathy Kelly's latest manuscript is due in on Monday, for publication in October: \"I knew I wasn't going to win, so I didn't bring my laptop, I didn't expect to be hanging around for long,\" she said guiltily.

      "bodyText": "Cathy Kelly, Belfast born and Dublin reared, swearing like a trooper with a hangover, yesterday became the Parker romantic novelist of the year. Ms Kelly has achieved the romantic dream of every red blooded journalist. \"I was always saying I was going to write a book, and then I finally did, and then it went to number one on the bestseller list so I thought 'Jaysus, I'd better write another',\" she said. Her fifth novel, Someone Like You, yesterday took the \u00a35,000 prize, beating a shortlist of six, which included four previous winners and the grande dame of the trade, Rosamunde Pilcher. Ms Pilcher, with 60 years writing, 30 novels and a shelf of disowned Mills and Boon titles behind her, said Someone Like You was one of a handful among the hundreds of novels she is sent every year which she could bear to read beyond the first three pages. Alan Titchmarsh, celebrity gardener reborn as a romantic novelist, presented the prizes at the Savoy hotel in London. When Ms Pilcher started writing at 18, not only was sex unmentionable for her heroines, so were divorce, alcohol and even going to the races. \"Now one tries to hold the line between writing about more challenging subjects in a more modern way, and driving away a whole generation of older readers,\" she said. Ms Kelly's heroines are usually tottering under the influence of excesses of one kind or another - although her book ends with a kiss in a car. She knows that \"romantic novel\" is still a term of abuse in literary circles. But Norma Curtis, novelist and chairwoman of the Romantic Novelists' Association, said: \"You only have to sell about 2,000 books to get on the Booker shortlist. Our books start with a print run of 30,000.\" Sales of romantic novels are only beaten by crime fiction, and a survey in 1996 found that 182m copies had been sold world wide that year. \"Bridget Jones has really changed the market, with all the 20 and 30-year-olds coming in for the first time as readers and writers,\" Ms Curtis said. \"The younger writers' books are much more earthy - bollocks is a very popular word now - and the older readers won't go near them, although the younger readers will read the older books.\" Cathy Kelly's latest manuscript is due in on Monday, for publication in October: \"I knew I wasn't going to win, so I didn't bring my laptop, I didn't expect to be hanging around for long,\" she said guiltily. HarperCollins, her publishers, will probably forgive her. Three years ago Ms Kelly was a hack in a Dublin newsroom.

      "body": "<p>Bernard Venables, who has died aged 94, was the best-known name in angling journalism since the second world war. He emerged quite suddenly, like a fully-hatched mayfly, on to the angling scene in 1947 as the creator of Mr Crabtree, a character in a cartoon strip about fishing in the Daily Mirror. A number of books followed, illustrated by the author, and the founding of two journals, so that his name has been before the angling public for the last half century.</p> <p>There had been a slowly-maturing preparation for this unusual career. Born in Catford, south London, Bernard's first fishing was in the mysterious dykes of Romney Marsh at the age of six. The other great loves of his life - painting and drawing - were encouraged by his training at Croydon School of Art in the 1920s. This was followed by work in commercial studios, and on the staff of the Daily Express. In 1939, he was drawn into a variety of war-work commissions, including writing and illustrating a book on battle tanks. He returned to the Express in 1945, but was then poached by the Daily Mirror.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, the most celebrated cartoon character in angling history made his public debut. Today, the Crabtree strip has a certain period charm; here is a father seeking refuge from postwar austerity on the river bank, and playing instructor and sage to his son Peter. Excellent drawings made all points clear, and Peter, eager and respectful in collar-and-tie and short trousers, is taken through a variety of angling situations.</p> <p>The series had such a runaway success that the Mirror persuaded Bernard to turn it into a book. Thus, in 1949, with the addition of commentary and coloured illustrations, Mr Crabtree Goes Fishing appeared - and at once began to sell in staggering numbers. A happy combination of the practical and the philosophical had created a work of irresistible charm. Eventually, more than 2m copies were sold, surpassing all angling titles since Izaak Walton. An edition was produced last year, and rapidly sold out.</p> <p>In 1953, Bernard was lured away from the Mirror by the broadcaster Howard Marshall. Marshall was ambitious to found a national angling paper in tabloid form, and had fixed on Bernard as his editorial director. Again, a real need had been identified; the circulation of Angling Times climbed from 30,000 in the first year to 170,000 in 1962. But Bernard was restless and slightly bored by its success, and was anxious to move on to some new creative challenge. In 1963, he got backing from Purnell for the launch of a new journal called Creel.</p> <p>Carrying articles from many leading angling writers of the day, it was distinguished by good design and the quality of the colour pictures reproduced by the new web offset process. But the issue of this venture was much less happy: Purnell became impatient with the high production costs and insisted on a drastic scaling-down of the paper, causing Bernard to leave in disgust.</p> <p>In the years that followed, Bernard was busily involved with appearances on radio and television, and with writing, punctuated by some larger-than-life experiences in the wider world.</p> <p>Already, in 1959, he had set up a one-man expedition to Madeira, which resulted in the landing of a 1700lb shark. In 1966, during a trip for the Zambian government to explore tourism possibilities, he trekked to the source of the Zambezi, and added to his growing fist of book titles with Coming Down The Zambezi. In 1967, he joined a group of men in the Azores still whaling in small, open boats, in the same primitive and dangerous way described in Moby Dick. From this he derived another book, Balela! (1967), a strangely moving account of the risky lives of desperately poor men lacking the security of the factory ship, and of the pitiful deaths of the great whales.</p> <p>Bernard was one of those people who refused to notice the onset of old age. He was well over 80 when he fished for tiger fish on Lake Kariba, and for Nile perch in Uganda, and was still writing, painting and broadcasting in the 1990s. Failing sight slowed him a little, but fishing expeditions were still possible - with friends in attendance to stop him from walking into the water.</p> <p>His philosophy was a little out of step with the signs and developments of the modern angling scene, which he observed with some disquiet. For him, fishing was not just an absorbing and delightful sport, but also an escape from the cares of modern life and a calm to the soul.

      "bodyText": "The shortlist for prestigious children's book award the Carnegie medal has been announced with a strong selection which includes three former winners and covers a wide range of issues. David Almond returns, two years after River Boy took the award, with Heaven Eyes, his tale of a group of friends who run away from a children's home. He is joined by another previous winner, Melvin Burgess, whose The Ghost Behind the Wall describes a child's reaction to an old man's deterioration through Alzheimer's disease. Burgess won the award in 1996 for his controversial drug-addiction story, Junk. After winning with Northern Lights in 1995, Philip Pullman returns with his ambitious conclusion to his Dark Materials trilogy, The Amber Spyglass. Also on the shortlist and a strong contender for the medal is this year's winner of the Whitbread children's book award, Coram Boy by Jamila Gavin, a disturbing tale of 18th-century child slavery. The other four shortlisted books are Sharon Creech's yachting adventure, The Wanderer; Alan Gibbons's computer game story, Shadow of the Minotaur; Beverley Naidoo's tale of a Nigerian brother and sister fleeing their country, The Other Side of Truth; and Adele Geras's reworking of a Greek myth, Troy. The oldest of the children's book awards, the inaugural Carnegie medal was given in 1937 and is now awarded annually by the Library Association for \"outstanding writing in a children's book\". It was won last year by Aiden Chambers for his second world war thriller Postcards from No Man's Land. The shortlist for the Carnegie's sister award, the Greenaway medal, which is given to \"outstanding illustration in a children's book\", has also been announced. Acclaimed illustrator Lauren Child has been nominated twice, once for Beware of the Storybook Wolves and again for I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato. She is joined by Ron Brooks for Fox, Anthony Browne for Willy's Pictures, Ruth Brown for Snail Trail, Ted Dewan for Crispin: The Pig Who Had It All and Jane Ray for Fairy Tales. For the fifth year running, children in libraries across the UK will be 'shadowing' the judging process across both medals, discussing the books in groups and picking their choice of winner. The winners of both medals will be announced on July 13.

He was also a distinguished film critic, and an internationally-appreciated director of film festivals, first in Taormina, Sicily, in the 1970s and early 1980s, and then, from 1987 for five years, at Venice.</p> <p>His gracious manners, knowledge of languages and general good taste in film made him popular with film professionals worldwide, many of whom owed him their critical and market attention. Several seashells he discovered are also named after him.</p> <p>Though he had a degree in chemistry, Biraghi preferred art to science as a career, and soon found an entry into journalism, joining the staff of the leading Rome newspaper Il Messaggero, for which, from 1953 to 1987, he was film critic and cultural contributor. His first play, a two-character conversation piece, The Sun And The Moon (1965), premiered in Rome, with Alida Valli returning to the stage after a 10-year exile in Mexico.</p> <p>As a critic, Biraghi distanced himself from the political prejudices that so often influenced many of his colleagues. His knowledge of languages helped his judgment of foreign films. I remember that when Bernardo Bertolucci showed Last Tango In Paris to the press in Rome, he gave us the choice of seeing it in the original English and French, or the version he had been obliged to dub into Italian. Biraghi was the only major Italian critic who joined the English-speakers in the smaller screening room.</p> <p>In 1970, he was called in to help out at the summer film event at Taormina, then less a festival than a promotional junket for movie people on holiday. Overcoming most of the local protests, Biraghi gradually gave it prestige. In the end, he managed to separate the first and second features competition from the more razzmatazz festival, leaving an imbecilic TV show on the last night, which he reluctantly had to bear with.</p> <p>He could, nonetheless, take credit for helping to give a wider European launch to several films that got only sidebar attention at Cannes, among them Peter Weir's Picnic At Hanging Rock in 1975, and Michael Radford's Another Time, Another Place in 1983, the latter being the only competition entry at Taormina to win the top award and both actor and actress prizes.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, when Venice was suffering from continual political and bureaucratic mishaps, Taormina was winning its own role as Italy's most intelligent and enjoyable festival. Not surprisingly, Venice beckoned to Biraghi, who, in 1987, was asked to be curator of the world's oldest film festival. By not being a political appointee, he was able to bully his gentlemanly way into favour.</p> <p>His first year's selection was put together in a hurry, but even so, the Golden Lion went to Louis Malle's Au Revoir Les Enfants. Before accepting a four-year term as director, he got his way in bringing in a private sponsor to pay the cost of covering the open-air arena.</p> <p>Biraghi was often accused of mistaken choices. He preferred one of Lina Wertmuller's worst films, On A Moonlit Night, about Aids, with Faye Dunaway and Peter O' Toole, to Peter Greenaway's The Cook, The Thief, His Wife And Her Lover, and he turned down Nanni Moretti's witty parable anticipating the fall of Italian communism, Palombella Rossa.</p> <p>In 1988, his stubborn decision to show Martin Scorsese's Last Temptation Of Christ stirred up a hornet's nest in the Catholic establishment. He continued to defend his right to show the films he personally liked, and to put quality before nationality.</p> <p>To his credit, Biraghi was a good talent scout. He helped to launch directors like Pedro Almodovar (Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown), Jane Campion (An Angel At My Table), and many Asian directors, including Hou Xiaoxian (City Of Sadness, Golden Lion 1989). He put no pressure on his juries, and did not flinch when jury president Gore Vidal upset almost everybody by persuading his colleagues, divided between Campion and Scorsese (Goodfellas), to give the Golden Lion to fellow writer and part-time director Tom Stoppard for Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead.</p> <p>Perhaps relieved to free himself from this too involving commitment, Biraghi dedicated his subsequent years to his seashells and travel, sitting on film juries - from Cannes, Berlin and Montreal, to Chicago, in which he had a special role.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Mascot</strong></p> <p>(W\u0142adys\u0142aw Starewicz, France 1934)</p> <p>It was at the Sitges film festival that I first saw an exhibition of work by the pioneering Russian animator W\u0142adys\u0142aw Starewicz, and the puppets were so enrapturing that when I got home I ordered up all the tapes I could find of his work. His work is absolutely breathtaking, surreal,inventive and extraordinary, encompassing everything that Jan \u0160vankmajer, Walerian Borowczyk and the Quay Brothers would do subsequently. This is his last film, after The Tale of the Fox from 1930; it is all right there in this cosmic animation soup. It is important, before you journey through all these mind-bending worlds, to remember that it was all done years ago, by someone most of us have forgotten about now. This is where it all began.</p> <p><strong>Pinocchio</strong></p> <p>(Hamilton Luske and Ben Sharpsteen, US, 1940)</p> <p>For me, as an American growing up in Minnesota, Walt Disney was animation. But the joy of Disney\u2019s films always came from watching the baddies. Pinocchio is visually the richest of his features and it is also the darkest. The Bad Boys\u2019 World is a truly immortal nightmare, full of eerie images of kids turning into donkeys and all manner of strangeness. Then there is that stuff with cages, and I notice now that every film I have made features a scene with somebody in a cage - a trait I attribute to watching Pinocchio. Great songs in that film too; Disney was essentially a musical film-maker. Plus there is something intriguing about a character who desperately wants to be a real person, but who we all think is actually more interesting as a piece of wood.</p> <p><strong>Red Hot Riding Hood</strong></p> <p>(Tex Avery, US, 1943)</p> <p>The magic of Tex Avery\u2019s animation is the sheer extremity of it all. The classic Avery image is of someone\u2019s mouth falling open down to their feet, wham, their eyes whooping out and their tongue unrolling for about half a mile: that is the most wonderfully liberating spectacle. Avery would just stretch the human body and face however he liked, and the result was unbelievably funny. There is no hesitation in his work, no sense that you can go too far. I think that nowadays they should put on Tex Avery festivals as an antidote to political correctness. There is also a childlike sense of immortality and indestructibility in his work; people get squashed, mashed, bashed, bent out of shape, whatever, and they bounce back. In essence, it is like the myth of eternal life.</p> <p><strong>Out of the Inkwell</strong></p> <p>(Dave Fleischer, US, 1938)</p> <p>I first saw this when I was a teenager and, in retrospect, it was a career leap for me. This was when I first discovered surrealism. You have a scenario in which you see an animator creating something which suddenly develops a life outside of the cartoon. The character starts communicating with the animator, and then it is Frankenstein all over again, the creation of a monster over which you have no control. Until I saw Out of the Inkwell, I had always thought of animation as existing on one plane, but here were the Fleischer brothers taking you right through the looking glass and into the picture. Of course, when I saw it I loved it - not because I wanted to be the animator whose ink comes to life, but because I wanted to be the animation, the clown wreaking havoc upon the world.</p> <p><strong>Death Breath</strong></p> <p>(Stan van der Beek, US, 1964)</p> <p>After college, I lived in New York with some people who would watch experimental avant-garde films. We embraced them because they annoyed everybody else, even though they were mostly awful. One night we were enduring some of this stuff when on to the screen came a cut-up image of Richard Nixon trying to talk with his foot in his mouth. It was the simplest animation pun imaginable. Years later, when I had come to England and we were working on a TV programme that was meant to make people laugh, there was a problem with dramatising one of the ideas. So I got a picture of Jimmy Young, cut it in half, moved his mouth around a bit and everybody laughed. That subsequently became a trademark, for which I think van der Beek should take credit.</p> <p><strong>Les Jeux des Anges</strong></p> <p>(Walerian Borowczyk, France, 1964)</p> <p>Walerian Borowczyk was a twisted man whose films were infused with a unique cruelty and weirdness. He started out making extraordinary animations, graduated to directing classics such as Goto, Island of Love and La B te, and then ended up directing Emmanuelle 5, which I think is a perversely fitting end. Les Jeux des Anges was my first experience of animation that was utterly impressionistic. It didn\u2019t show me anything specific, just sound and movement from which you create a world of your own.</p> <p><strong>Dimensions of Dialogue</strong></p> <p>(Jan \u0160vankmajer, Czechoslovakia, 1982)</p> <p>Jan \u0160vankmajer\u2019s stop-motion work uses familiar, unremarkable objects in a way which is deeply disturbing. The first film of his that I saw was Alice, and I was extremely unsettled by the image of an animated rabbit which had real fur and real eyes. His films always leave me with mixed feelings, but they all have moments that really get to me; moments that evoke the nightmarish spectre of seeing commonplace things coming unexpectedly to life.</p> <p><strong>Street of Crocodiles</strong></p> <p>(The Quay Brothers, UK, 1986)</p> <p>There is something peculiar about falling for Jan Svankmajer and then discovering the Quay brothers - Americans who came to Europe and somehow wound up working in a style that felt like Polish animation. As an American, I always wanted to be seduced into this strange decadent, rotting idea of Europe, and the Quays have created that world in a manner which hypnotises me, but which I don\u2019t fully understand. Maybe I like them because they ended up going further east than I did.</p> <p><strong>Knickknack</strong></p> <p>(John Lasseter, US, 1989)</p> <p>John Lasseter\u2019s work was the first digital animation that had genuine life in the characters. To be able to mix that level of characterisation with the smooth, crisp, clean quality of computer animation, to give it a real sense of three-dimensional existence, of touchiness and tactility, was like discovering a whole new texture of animation. The quality has endured from Lasseter\u2019s short films such as Knickknack through to Toy Story 1 and 2, both of which are touching, funny, intelligent and brilliant.</p> <p><strong>South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut</strong></p> <p>(Trey Parker, US, 1999)</p> <p>Parker and Stone are the only guys who were ever inspired by me, who took the crudeness of my animation to even lower depths. Their stuff is so shoddy that it is miraculous that it works at all. I assured them that while it may be great for TV, there was no way to sustain it for 90 minutes. And, of course, their movie worked just brilliantly.</p> <p>Terry Gilliam\u2019s Desert Island Flicks is tonight at Animated Encounters 2001 at the Watershed, Bristol (0117-925 3845). The festival continues until Sunday.</p>",

Great songs in that film too; Disney was essentially a musical film-maker. Plus there is something intriguing about a character who desperately wants to be a real person, but who we all think is actually more interesting as a piece of wood. Red Hot Riding Hood (Tex Avery, US, 1943) The magic of Tex Avery\u2019s animation is the sheer extremity of it all. The classic Avery image is of someone\u2019s mouth falling open down to their feet, wham, their eyes whooping out and their tongue unrolling for about half a mile: that is the most wonderfully liberating spectacle. Avery would just stretch the human body and face however he liked, and the result was unbelievably funny. There is no hesitation in his work, no sense that you can go too far. I think that nowadays they should put on Tex Avery festivals as an antidote to political correctness. There is also a childlike sense of immortality and indestructibility in his work; people get squashed, mashed, bashed, bent out of shape, whatever, and they bounce back. In essence, it is like the myth of eternal life. Out of the Inkwell (Dave Fleischer, US, 1938) I first saw this when I was a teenager and, in retrospect, it was a career leap for me. This was when I first discovered surrealism. You have a scenario in which you see an animator creating something which suddenly develops a life outside of the cartoon. The character starts communicating with the animator, and then it is Frankenstein all over again, the creation of a monster over which you have no control. Until I saw Out of the Inkwell, I had always thought of animation as existing on one plane, but here were the Fleischer brothers taking you right through the looking glass and into the picture. Of course, when I saw it I loved it - not because I wanted to be the animator whose ink comes to life, but because I wanted to be the animation, the clown wreaking havoc upon the world. Death Breath (Stan van der Beek, US, 1964) After college, I lived in New York with some people who would watch experimental avant-garde films. We embraced them because they annoyed everybody else, even though they were mostly awful. One night we were enduring some of this stuff when on to the screen came a cut-up image of Richard Nixon trying to talk with his foot in his mouth. It was the simplest animation pun imaginable. Years later, when I had come to England and we were working on a TV programme that was meant to make people laugh, there was a problem with dramatising one of the ideas. So I got a picture of Jimmy Young, cut it in half, moved his mouth around a bit and everybody laughed. That subsequently became a trademark, for which I think van der Beek should take credit. Les Jeux des Anges (Walerian Borowczyk, France, 1964) Walerian Borowczyk was a twisted man whose films were infused with a unique cruelty and weirdness. He started out making extraordinary animations, graduated to directing classics such as Goto, Island of Love and La B te, and then ended up directing Emmanuelle 5, which I think is a perversely fitting end. Les Jeux des Anges was my first experience of animation that was utterly impressionistic. It didn\u2019t show me anything specific, just sound and movement from which you create a world of your own. Dimensions of Dialogue (Jan \u0160vankmajer, Czechoslovakia, 1982) Jan \u0160vankmajer\u2019s stop-motion work uses familiar, unremarkable objects in a way which is deeply disturbing. The first film of his that I saw was Alice, and I was extremely unsettled by the image of an animated rabbit which had real fur and real eyes. His films always leave me with mixed feelings, but they all have moments that really get to me; moments that evoke the nightmarish spectre of seeing commonplace things coming unexpectedly to life. Street of Crocodiles (The Quay Brothers, UK, 1986) There is something peculiar about falling for Jan Svankmajer and then discovering the Quay brothers - Americans who came to Europe and somehow wound up working in a style that felt like Polish animation. As an American, I always wanted to be seduced into this strange decadent, rotting idea of Europe, and the Quays have created that world in a manner which hypnotises me, but which I don\u2019t fully understand. Maybe I like them because they ended up going further east than I did. Knickknack (John Lasseter, US, 1989) John Lasseter\u2019s work was the first digital animation that had genuine life in the characters. To be able to mix that level of characterisation with the smooth, crisp, clean quality of computer animation, to give it a real sense of three-dimensional existence, of touchiness and tactility, was like discovering a whole new texture of animation. The quality has endured from Lasseter\u2019s short films such as Knickknack through to Toy Story 1 and 2, both of which are touching, funny, intelligent and brilliant. South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (Trey Parker, US, 1999) Parker and Stone are the only guys who were ever inspired by me, who took the crudeness of my animation to even lower depths. Their stuff is so shoddy that it is miraculous that it works at all. I assured them that while it may be great for TV, there was no way to sustain it for 90 minutes. And, of course, their movie worked just brilliantly. Terry Gilliam\u2019s Desert Island Flicks is tonight at Animated Encounters 2001 at the Watershed, Bristol (0117-925 3845). The festival continues until Sunday.",

      "body": "<p>Having endured fires, floods, riots, mudslides, and earthquakes, Los Angeles is bracing itself for its next potential disaster: simultaneous strikes by Hollywood's writers and actors. If, as expected, the Writers Guild of America strikes when its contract expires on May 1, and if the actors' unions (the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) follow suit when their contracts expire on June 30, Hollywood could see several months in which virtually all film and television production is shut down. As a result, the industry could face nearly $7bn in lost income and more than 81,000 lost jobs, according to a study commissioned by the Mayor of Los Angeles, Richard J Riordan, who announced its findings last week. </p> <p>The writers and the actors are demanding more in \"residuals\", payments for replays of films and TV programmes, in markets that barely existed or generated little revenue when contracts were last renegotiated a few years ago, such as video/DVD, basic cable, the Fox TV network and overseas TV. Since few of the 11,000 writers and 135,000 actors are actually working at any given time, and since fewer still earn the eight-figure salaries of Tom Hanks or Mel Gibson, residuals from past work may constitute most of an actor's or writer's earnings. </p> <p>Members of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) argue, however, that these payments could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when their revenues are shrink ing because of increased production costs - due, in no small part, to the ballooning salaries of top actors and writers. </p> <p>The last time the writers picketed, in the summer of 1988, the walkout lasted five months, delaying the start of the network TV season by about three months and sending millions of defecting viewers to cable. Last year's actors' strike, against the producers of TV commercials, lasted a record six months. If the actors strike this summer, no one expects work to resume before September or October. </p> <p>To lessen the impact of the walkouts, which no one claims to want but everyone thinks are inevitable, studios have been speeding up production schedules to cram as many movies into the pre-strike window as possible. </p> <p>Stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow (who has shot four movies in recent months) and Julia Roberts (who cut short her Oscar partying so she could film America's Sweethearts and Ocean's Eleven back-to-back) have been working overtime, as if to aid the very producers whom the strikes are supposed to cripple. </p> <p>Many movie shoots, however, are in limbo until the strikes are averted or settled, and threats of a labour stoppage may have shut down some productions altogether (see accompanying chart). Since a big-budget Hollywood movie can take 75 days to shoot, any film that did not start shooting before last week is effectively shut down already. </p> <p>Whether or not the impact of the strikes is as deep as Mayor Riordan fears, it will certainly be wide. The following shows how the highest-profile projects will be - and are already being - affected. </p> <p><strong>Basic Instinct 2</strong> Intermedia/MGM </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Sharon Stone returns as everyone's favourite icepick-wielding, panties-eschewing, bisexual serial killer. John McTiernan (Die Hard, The Thomas Crown Affair) will direct. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Producers haven't been able to find a suitable leading man in time for a pre-strike shoot: Pierce Brosnan said no, and Stone dragged her feet so long on approving Benjamin Bratt that he signed on for another pre-strike production, Abandon. However, since the distributor MGM has no financial stake in BI2, the film is eligible for a union waiver, so shooting could start as soon as a lead is cast, strike or no strike. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> 2002 </p> <p><strong>Butterfly Revolution </strong> Sony/Revolution </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Thriller that would reteam Julia Roberts with The Mexican director Gore Verbinski.</p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> With Roberts working back-to-back on Ocean's Eleven and America's Sweethearts, she had only a 50-day window before the strike deadline to shoot a 70-day movie.</p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Mothballed</p> <p><strong>The Cat in the Hat</strong> Universal/Imagine </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> From the folks who brought you Jim Carrey as the Grinch comes another Dr Seuss adaptation, this time with Tim Allen as the homewrecking feline.</p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Producers didn't even commission a screenplay until late February, so there's no way this will be ready to shoot before the deadline. But after the strike, Allen is also committed to shooting Disney's The Santa Clause 2, which was also delayed because Allen wanted a script rewrite.</p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> 2003</p> <p><strong>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</strong> Warner Bros/ Renaissance </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> The autobiography of Chuck Barris, creator of TV's talent-free talent contest The Gong Show, and self-styled CIA spy to boot. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> With Johnny Depp as the star and Bryan Singer (X-Men) as the director, this was to be Renaissance's tentpole, for which it had set aside small British projects such as Dr Sleep and Personal Shopping. But financial details weren't finalised in time for a pre-strike shoot. Two of the executives who helped relaunch the UK production company two years ago have lost their jobs. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Gonggggg! </p> <p><strong>Enchanted</strong> Disney </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Live-action/animation mix about a fairytale princess who is banished to modern-day New York City. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Toons can't strike, and the voice actors may be able to record their parts before June 30, but the live portion, with possible stars John Travolta and Susan Sarandon, will have to wait until the strikes end happily ever after. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Christmas 2002 </p> <p><strong>The Green Hornet</strong> Universal </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Based on the old radio/television/comics action serial, less famous today for its hero than for his sidekick, the karate-chopping Kato, who was played on TV in the 1960s by a young Bruce Lee. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Universal has been trying to get this off the ground for five years and seemed to be on its way with the Hong Kong action legend Jet Li as Kato. But Li dropped out late last year and the studio failed to find a replacement (much less a lead actor) in time to shoot before a strike. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> KO'd </p> <p><strong>Indiana Jones 4</strong> Paramount </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Who knows? But Premiere magazine reports that Harrison Ford is still interested and that both M Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) and Stephen Gaghan (Traffic) have been approached to write it. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Still very much in the just-talking stage, but the potential strikes are sure to delay production even further. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Not before 2003 </p> <p><strong>Kill Bill</strong> Miramax </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Quentin Tarantino's long-awaited follow-up to 1997's Jackie Brown would be a revenge/martial arts thriller starring Uma Thurman. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Having decided that he can't teach Uma to fly and wield a sword like Michelle Yeoh in time for a pre-strike shoot, Tarantino has put this one on the back burner, favouring instead the second world war drama Glorious Bastards or else the prequel The Vega Brothers, which would unite John Travolta's Pulp Fiction gangster with Michael Madsen's Reservoir Dogs ear-slicer. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Killed </p> <p><strong>The Matrix 2</strong> Warner Bros </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> What is The Matrix 2? Plots for this cyberpunk/kung fu sequel and Matrix 3 remain top secret. But Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne are rebooting. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Originally, the directors Andy and Larry Wachowski, were going to shoot parts 2 and 3 back-to-back in Australia. Now, the plan is to shoot for a few weeks outside San Francisco, spend the strike months working on the special effects, then return to Australia to complete the two films. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Christmas 2002 for Matrix 2, summer 2003 for Matrix 3 </p> <p><strong>Men In Black 2</strong> Columbia </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return as the nattily-dressed alien fighters. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> As with The Matrix 2, the film-makers will shoot as much as they can before June 30, then retire to the special-effects shop until the strike ends. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> July 2002 </p> <p><strong>A Sound of Thunder</strong> Warner Bros/Franchise </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> An adaptation of the Ray Bradbury story about a time-travelling dinosaur-hunter. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> The film was all set to go until the star Pierce Brosnan asked for a rewrite. Producers decided it could not be done in time for a pre-strike shoot, and by the time the rewrite is ready, Brosnan may be unavailable, since he has to shoot the next James Bond movie. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Possibly extinct </p> <p><strong>Spy Kids 2</strong> Miramax/Dimension </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Sequel to the current kiddie cloak-and-dagger hit. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> SK1 director Robert Rodriguez has a script all ready to shoot, as soon as the strikes end. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> 2002 </p> <p><strong>Taking Lives</strong> Warner Bros </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Female FBI profiler tracks serial killer who assumes his victims' identities. Based on the Michael Pye novel. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> Having spent years trying to sign Gwyneth Paltrow or Cate Blanchett, and seeing the director Tony Scott (Top Gun) come and go, producers are now talking with Scott and Jennifer Lopez. Shooting would start in autumn, or whenever the strikes end. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> 2002 </p> <p><strong>Terminator 3</strong> Intermedia </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> They'll be back: the T2 stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong, that is (not, however, the writer/director James Cameron or their co-star, Linda Hamilton). This time, our heroes face (gasp!) a female cyborg. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> The independently-financed film could not get the required insurance policy and the producers were not sure they could finish shooting before June 30. Once the strikes end, Jonathan Mostow (U-571) will direct. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> 2002 </p> <p><strong>Two Guys on the Job</strong> Beacon </p> <p><strong>Storyline:</strong> Kevin Costner and the director Ron Shelton (Bull Durham, Tin Cup) were to reteam for this drama about two policemen whose friendship is tested by a corruption scandal. </p> <p><strong>Impact of the strike:</strong> When the producers failed to find a co-star, Shelton took off for another cop drama, The Plague Season, leaving Costner holding the bag. </p> <p><strong>Release:</strong> Out of work </p> <p><strong>How the industry will be affected</strong> </p> <p><strong>Actors</strong> </p> <p>Many of them probably want a vacation after the extra work they have done over the past few months. Several film and TV stars plan to spend their summer on the New York stage, including Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Eric McCormack, Don Cheadle, Billy Crudup, Natalie Portman, John Goodman, Christopher Walken, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Allison Janney. </p> <p><strong>Writers</strong> </p> <p>Traditionally the least esteemed group in Hollywood, the writers are fighting not just for money but also for respect. They want more creative control over their screenplays once shooting starts, and they want to end the \"possessory credit\", the \"a film by...\" citation that names the director and not the writer as the sole creator of a movie. The Directors Guild of America, however, remains unwilling to give up its favoured status. </p> <p><strong>Studios</strong> </p> <p>Thanks to the extra work of writers and actors in recent months, most of the releases for the next year have already been shot. Independent producers who are not members of AMPTP may be eligible for union waivers, so they may continue to shoot. However, many of this summer's releases depend heavily on expensive publicity campaigns centred around the stars, and if the guilds bar the stars from promoting their work, many completed films could get pushed back until after the strike, ruining Hollywood's most lucrative season of the year. </p> <p><strong>Cinema owners</strong> </p> <p>Naturally, they are panicking about a lack of product, especially with the current summer slate, which is low on the big names (Jim, Mel, Tom, Harrison) that draw ticket buyers. </p> <p><strong>Print media</strong> </p> <p>A publicity embargo could hurt weekly magazines, newspapers, TV shows and other outlets that depend heavily on celebrities to draw viewers and readers. Monthly magazines that conduct interviews well in advance may have to shuffle stories at the last minute to accommodate changes in film release dates. </p> <p><strong>Agents</strong> </p> <p>Ten percent of nothing is nothing. The big talent agencies have already laid off assistants and slashed expense accounts. </p> <p><strong>Support workers</strong> </p> <p>No production means no work for the camera operators, caterers, pool cleaners, personal trainers, hairdressers, dog walkers and the like. The Teamsters union, which does much of the driving and heavy lifting for Hollywood, has already threatened to withhold its support of striking writers and actors. </p>",

Members of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) argue, however, that these payments could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when their revenues are shrink ing because of increased production costs - due, in no small part, to the ballooning salaries of top actors and writers. The last time the writers picketed, in the summer of 1988, the walkout lasted five months, delaying the start of the network TV season by about three months and sending millions of defecting viewers to cable. Last year's actors' strike, against the producers of TV commercials, lasted a record six months. If the actors strike this summer, no one expects work to resume before September or October. To lessen the impact of the walkouts, which no one claims to want but everyone thinks are inevitable, studios have been speeding up production schedules to cram as many movies into the pre-strike window as possible. Stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow (who has shot four movies in recent months) and Julia Roberts (who cut short her Oscar partying so she could film America's Sweethearts and Ocean's Eleven back-to-back) have been working overtime, as if to aid the very producers whom the strikes are supposed to cripple. Many movie shoots, however, are in limbo until the strikes are averted or settled, and threats of a labour stoppage may have shut down some productions altogether (see accompanying chart). Since a big-budget Hollywood movie can take 75 days to shoot, any film that did not start shooting before last week is effectively shut down already. Whether or not the impact of the strikes is as deep as Mayor Riordan fears, it will certainly be wide. The following shows how the highest-profile projects will be - and are already being - affected. Basic Instinct 2 Intermedia/MGM Storyline: Sharon Stone returns as everyone's favourite icepick-wielding, panties-eschewing, bisexual serial killer. John McTiernan (Die Hard, The Thomas Crown Affair) will direct. Impact of the strike: Producers haven't been able to find a suitable leading man in time for a pre-strike shoot: Pierce Brosnan said no, and Stone dragged her feet so long on approving Benjamin Bratt that he signed on for another pre-strike production, Abandon. However, since the distributor MGM has no financial stake in BI2, the film is eligible for a union waiver, so shooting could start as soon as a lead is cast, strike or no strike. Release: 2002 Butterfly Revolution Sony/Revolution Storyline: Thriller that would reteam Julia Roberts with The Mexican director Gore Verbinski. Impact of the strike: With Roberts working back-to-back on Ocean's Eleven and America's Sweethearts, she had only a 50-day window before the strike deadline to shoot a 70-day movie. Release: Mothballed The Cat in the Hat Universal/Imagine Storyline: From the folks who brought you Jim Carrey as the Grinch comes another Dr Seuss adaptation, this time with Tim Allen as the homewrecking feline. Impact of the strike: Producers didn't even commission a screenplay until late February, so there's no way this will be ready to shoot before the deadline. But after the strike, Allen is also committed to shooting Disney's The Santa Clause 2, which was also delayed because Allen wanted a script rewrite. Release: 2003 Confessions of a Dangerous Mind Warner Bros/ Renaissance Storyline: The autobiography of Chuck Barris, creator of TV's talent-free talent contest The Gong Show, and self-styled CIA spy to boot. Impact of the strike: With Johnny Depp as the star and Bryan Singer (X-Men) as the director, this was to be Renaissance's tentpole, for which it had set aside small British projects such as Dr Sleep and Personal Shopping. But financial details weren't finalised in time for a pre-strike shoot. Two of the executives who helped relaunch the UK production company two years ago have lost their jobs. Release: Gonggggg! Enchanted Disney Storyline: Live-action/animation mix about a fairytale princess who is banished to modern-day New York City. Impact of the strike: Toons can't strike, and the voice actors may be able to record their parts before June 30, but the live portion, with possible stars John Travolta and Susan Sarandon, will have to wait until the strikes end happily ever after. Release: Christmas 2002 The Green Hornet Universal Storyline: Based on the old radio/television/comics action serial, less famous today for its hero than for his sidekick, the karate-chopping Kato, who was played on TV in the 1960s by a young Bruce Lee. Impact of the strike: Universal has been trying to get this off the ground for five years and seemed to be on its way with the Hong Kong action legend Jet Li as Kato. But Li dropped out late last year and the studio failed to find a replacement (much less a lead actor) in time to shoot before a strike. Release: KO'd Indiana Jones 4 Paramount Storyline: Who knows? But Premiere magazine reports that Harrison Ford is still interested and that both M Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense) and Stephen Gaghan (Traffic) have been approached to write it. Impact of the strike: Still very much in the just-talking stage, but the potential strikes are sure to delay production even further. Release: Not before 2003 Kill Bill Miramax Storyline: Quentin Tarantino's long-awaited follow-up to 1997's Jackie Brown would be a revenge/martial arts thriller starring Uma Thurman. Impact of the strike: Having decided that he can't teach Uma to fly and wield a sword like Michelle Yeoh in time for a pre-strike shoot, Tarantino has put this one on the back burner, favouring instead the second world war drama Glorious Bastards or else the prequel The Vega Brothers, which would unite John Travolta's Pulp Fiction gangster with Michael Madsen's Reservoir Dogs ear-slicer. Release: Killed The Matrix 2 Warner Bros Storyline: What is The Matrix 2? Plots for this cyberpunk/kung fu sequel and Matrix 3 remain top secret. But Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne are rebooting. Impact of the strike: Originally, the directors Andy and Larry Wachowski, were going to shoot parts 2 and 3 back-to-back in Australia. Now, the plan is to shoot for a few weeks outside San Francisco, spend the strike months working on the special effects, then return to Australia to complete the two films. Release: Christmas 2002 for Matrix 2, summer 2003 for Matrix 3 Men In Black 2 Columbia Storyline: Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones return as the nattily-dressed alien fighters. Impact of the strike: As with The Matrix 2, the film-makers will shoot as much as they can before June 30, then retire to the special-effects shop until the strike ends. Release: July 2002 A Sound of Thunder Warner Bros/Franchise Storyline: An adaptation of the Ray Bradbury story about a time-travelling dinosaur-hunter. Impact of the strike: The film was all set to go until the star Pierce Brosnan asked for a rewrite. Producers decided it could not be done in time for a pre-strike shoot, and by the time the rewrite is ready, Brosnan may be unavailable, since he has to shoot the next James Bond movie. Release: Possibly extinct Spy Kids 2 Miramax/Dimension Storyline: Sequel to the current kiddie cloak-and-dagger hit. Impact of the strike: SK1 director Robert Rodriguez has a script all ready to shoot, as soon as the strikes end. Release: 2002 Taking Lives Warner Bros Storyline: Female FBI profiler tracks serial killer who assumes his victims' identities. Based on the Michael Pye novel. Impact of the strike: Having spent years trying to sign Gwyneth Paltrow or Cate Blanchett, and seeing the director Tony Scott (Top Gun) come and go, producers are now talking with Scott and Jennifer Lopez. Shooting would start in autumn, or whenever the strikes end. Release: 2002 Terminator 3 Intermedia Storyline: They'll be back: the T2 stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong, that is (not, however, the writer/director James Cameron or their co-star, Linda Hamilton). This time, our heroes face (gasp!) a female cyborg. Impact of the strike: The independently-financed film could not get the required insurance policy and the producers were not sure they could finish shooting before June 30. Once the strikes end, Jonathan Mostow (U-571) will direct. Release: 2002 Two Guys on the Job Beacon Storyline: Kevin Costner and the director Ron Shelton (Bull Durham, Tin Cup) were to reteam for this drama about two policemen whose friendship is tested by a corruption scandal. Impact of the strike: When the producers failed to find a co-star, Shelton took off for another cop drama, The Plague Season, leaving Costner holding the bag. Release: Out of work How the industry will be affected Actors Many of them probably want a vacation after the extra work they have done over the past few months. Several film and TV stars plan to spend their summer on the New York stage, including Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Eric McCormack, Don Cheadle, Billy Crudup, Natalie Portman, John Goodman, Christopher Walken, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Allison Janney. Writers Traditionally the least esteemed group in Hollywood, the writers are fighting not just for money but also for respect. They want more creative control over their screenplays once shooting starts, and they want to end the \"possessory credit\", the \"a film by...\" citation that names the director and not the writer as the sole creator of a movie. The Directors Guild of America, however, remains unwilling to give up its favoured status. Studios Thanks to the extra work of writers and actors in recent months, most of the releases for the next year have already been shot. Independent producers who are not members of AMPTP may be eligible for union waivers, so they may continue to shoot. However, many of this summer's releases depend heavily on expensive publicity campaigns centred around the stars, and if the guilds bar the stars from promoting their work, many completed films could get pushed back until after the strike, ruining Hollywood's most lucrative season of the year. Cinema owners Naturally, they are panicking about a lack of product, especially with the current summer slate, which is low on the big names (Jim, Mel, Tom, Harrison) that draw ticket buyers. Print media A publicity embargo could hurt weekly magazines, newspapers, TV shows and other outlets that depend heavily on celebrities to draw viewers and readers. Monthly magazines that conduct interviews well in advance may have to shuffle stories at the last minute to accommodate changes in film release dates. Agents Ten percent of nothing is nothing. The big talent agencies have already laid off assistants and slashed expense accounts. Support workers No production means no work for the camera operators, caterers, pool cleaners, personal trainers, hairdressers, dog walkers and the like. The Teamsters union, which does much of the driving and heavy lifting for Hollywood, has already threatened to withhold its support of striking writers and actors.",

      "body": "<p>All of a sudden it seems like everyone wants to be James Bond. Apparently the venerable franchise still manages to cast a bewitching spell over male actors in their mid-30s. How long have they fantasised about strolling into that fabled gun-barrel iris, swivelling and firing and causing that curtain of crimson to cascade down the screen just before the traditional pre-credit action sequence and the mudbath-in-a-tittie-bar credits? How many thousands of hours did they spend in front of mirrors in their teenage bedrooms growling, \"Good God, an ejector seat!\" or \"Dom Perignon above 39 degrees Fahrenheit is like listening to the Beatles without earmuffs\" - or perhaps the most lascivious line in the series, repeated several times in Goldfinger: \"Soooo, Puuussy . . .\"? How is it that this endearingly preposterous, bizarrely anachronistic hero figure - whose original contexts, the cold war of the novels, the whizz-bang, gadget-gorged parallel-1960s of the Connery movies, have evaporated into dust - still manages to exert such a strong hold on actors? </p> <p>The list of pretenders to Pierce Brosnan's soon-to-elapse licence to kill shows that actorly enthusiasm is extensive and undimmed. Brosnan's 007 contract with the Broccoli family expires after his next mission, and his recent movies, like The Thomas Crown Affair and particularly The Tailor of Panama, suggest that he's already in training for a post-Bond career. He hasn't definitively ruled out the possibility of re-enlisting for another stint, but whether he does one or two more Bonds, the replacement killers are circling already. And an odd bunch they are. </p> <p>The most prominent and, I think, least likely candidate at the moment seems to be the Down Under Wonder, Russell Crowe. Unfortunately, Crowe is already a superstar on his own terms after the success of Gladiator, and he did a pretty useful quasi-Bond turn in the recent thriller Proof of Life, the film that is making people consider him for 007. There he was tough, utterly commanding, ruthless, babesome and forceful - which ticks every box on the Bond application form. Trouble is, he's also a very fine and subtle actor (witness his pudgy Jeffrey Wiegand in The Insider) and the character of Bond is little more than a chalk outline surrounding some timeworn quirks and a quiverful of smartass quips. </p> <p>The last thing you need for this is a great actor; look at the way the series atrophied during the reign of the highly intelligent Timothy Dalton. Expecting Crowe - who would probably resent the franchise's constraints - to take on the role is as futile as Ian Fleming's oft-expressed desire to see Cary Grant playing Bond. Fleming was said to have been deeply uneasy about the Etonian superspy of his novels being played by Connery, a mere ex-milkman from Edinburgh - which proves that it's sometimes worth offloading the author once the movie rights have been secured. </p> <p>No, what you need is someone like the medium-subtle Brosnan (my second favourite Bond after the magisterial Connery. Oh, sue me), a man who hungered after the role even before Dalton was recruited, and who was vocally narked at being passed over. Brosnan has been devoted to the franchise, which was in a confused post-cold war slump when he took over. He realised that his name was now on the door and after all his intensive lobbying for the part, he needed to deliver on his claims. And deliver he did. Even though his movies don't soar to the heights of Goldfinger or On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Brosnan himself has always been worth watching. This puts his replacement in a similar position to that confronting poor George Lazenby when he replaced Connery in 1969. </p> <p>One odds-against candidate's ambitions seem to parallel those of Lazenby - whose previous experience included a chocolate commercial and little else. Colin Wells has been Brosnan's stand-in for the last couple of movies and his name seems to be in the running. This option suggests that the actor is merely an insertable/removable aspect of the Bond movies' design - as characterless as the gadgets, and every bit as replaceable. Although that approach worked with On Her Majesty's Secret Service - my favourite Bond these days, perhaps because it features such un-Bond elements as love, marriage, real emotion and actual tragedy - there was only a shadow 007 at the film\"s centre. </p> <p>The rise of Gerard Butler - \"the Scottish unknown\", as the tabloids are calling him - seems meanwhile to parallel the ascent of Connery in 1961: also Scottish, also little-known. A good but unfamiliar actor is what the series needs now, one who can grow in the role and make it his own (Broccolis permitting). I'm unfamiliar with Butler's work, but the profile seems to fit. Unlike that of Robbie Williams, who was patronised by casting director Debbie McWilliams: \"Robbie, bless him, I don't think is quite what we are looking for.\" Oof. </p> <p>Colin Firth's name has also surfaced here and there, probably because he currently turning heads in Bridget Jones, though perhaps his intelligence and coolness disqualify him for the role (which I don't think he's even seeking). I also have a sneaking suspicion that Fleming would have been delighted with him, and that clinches it for me: no Colin. </p> <p>Better perhaps, if looking among the ranks of intelligent, posh actors, to examine the claims of James Purefoy from A Dance to the Music of Time. His name surfaced as a Bond candidate about a year ago in, of all places, the alumni newsletter of the school we both attended. I have no idea where that story came from, but to me it made immediate sense. Plus I'd have the chance to tell my friends, \"See that new James Bond? He stole my girlfriend once, the bastard!\" The truth of the matter was that she very wisely chose him, but I always chuckle appreciatively when he's on TV, and - who knows? - he might make a fine 007.</p>",

The most prominent and, I think, least likely candidate at the moment seems to be the Down Under Wonder, Russell Crowe. Unfortunately, Crowe is already a superstar on his own terms after the success of Gladiator, and he did a pretty useful quasi-Bond turn in the recent thriller Proof of Life, the film that is making people consider him for 007. There he was tough, utterly commanding, ruthless, babesome and forceful - which ticks every box on the Bond application form. Trouble is, he's also a very fine and subtle actor (witness his pudgy Jeffrey Wiegand in The Insider) and the character of Bond is little more than a chalk outline surrounding some timeworn quirks and a quiverful of smartass quips. The last thing you need for this is a great actor; look at the way the series atrophied during the reign of the highly intelligent Timothy Dalton. Expecting Crowe - who would probably resent the franchise's constraints - to take on the role is as futile as Ian Fleming's oft-expressed desire to see Cary Grant playing Bond. Fleming was said to have been deeply uneasy about the Etonian superspy of his novels being played by Connery, a mere ex-milkman from Edinburgh - which proves that it's sometimes worth offloading the author once the movie rights have been secured. No, what you need is someone like the medium-subtle Brosnan (my second favourite Bond after the magisterial Connery. Oh, sue me), a man who hungered after the role even before Dalton was recruited, and who was vocally narked at being passed over. Brosnan has been devoted to the franchise, which was in a confused post-cold war slump when he took over. He realised that his name was now on the door and after all his intensive lobbying for the part, he needed to deliver on his claims. And deliver he did. Even though his movies don't soar to the heights of Goldfinger or On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Brosnan himself has always been worth watching. This puts his replacement in a similar position to that confronting poor George Lazenby when he replaced Connery in 1969. One odds-against candidate's ambitions seem to parallel those of Lazenby - whose previous experience included a chocolate commercial and little else. Colin Wells has been Brosnan's stand-in for the last couple of movies and his name seems to be in the running. This option suggests that the actor is merely an insertable/removable aspect of the Bond movies' design - as characterless as the gadgets, and every bit as replaceable. Although that approach worked with On Her Majesty's Secret Service - my favourite Bond these days, perhaps because it features such un-Bond elements as love, marriage, real emotion and actual tragedy - there was only a shadow 007 at the film\"s centre. The rise of Gerard Butler - \"the Scottish unknown\", as the tabloids are calling him - seems meanwhile to parallel the ascent of Connery in 1961: also Scottish, also little-known. A good but unfamiliar actor is what the series needs now, one who can grow in the role and make it his own (Broccolis permitting). I'm unfamiliar with Butler's work, but the profile seems to fit. Unlike that of Robbie Williams, who was patronised by casting director Debbie McWilliams: \"Robbie, bless him, I don't think is quite what we are looking for.\" Oof. Colin Firth's name has also surfaced here and there, probably because he currently turning heads in Bridget Jones, though perhaps his intelligence and coolness disqualify him for the role (which I don't think he's even seeking). I also have a sneaking suspicion that Fleming would have been delighted with him, and that clinches it for me: no Colin. Better perhaps, if looking among the ranks of intelligent, posh actors, to examine the claims of James Purefoy from A Dance to the Music of Time. His name surfaced as a Bond candidate about a year ago in, of all places, the alumni newsletter of the school we both attended. I have no idea where that story came from, but to me it made immediate sense. Plus I'd have the chance to tell my friends, \"See that new James Bond? He stole my girlfriend once, the bastard!\" The truth of the matter was that she very wisely chose him, but I always chuckle appreciatively when he's on TV, and - who knows? - he might make a fine 007.",

I can only say that on a second viewing, Bread and Roses has bloomed into an intensely watchable, deeply felt, terrifically acted\u00c9 and very exciting story of love and politics.</p> <p>Some may find this last element a little black and white - but from the point of view of the exploited underclass in LA, that teeming capital of the third world, that's probably exactly how politics looks.

Terrified of being reported to immigration, they and the other illegals submit to exploitation and sexual harassment until they are galvanised by Sam (Adrien Brody), a middle-class Anglo union organiser who co-opts them all into his \"Justice for Janitors\" campaign. Gradually, Maya falls for the cute, dishevelled Sam. </p> <p>Loach's movie shows a Los Angeles utterly absent from mainstream Hollywood movie-making: a Los Angeles that does not show up on the conventional cinema radar. It is neither the glamorous world of fictional sex and money, nor the obviously exoticised \"criminal\" world of the wrong side of the tracks: it is the quotidian world of corporate LA, and Loach shows us how this universe looks if you are part of the service economy. </p> <p>Loach, and his long-time colleagues, cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, and production designer Martin Johnson, brilliantly show how unsexy the corporate environment is for those without money. The iridescent marble forecourts, the dazzling glass architecture, the burnished steel of the handrails: they are all deeply alienating when you are being paid very little to clean them, or if, as a supplicant hoping for just this sort of job, you are being curtly told to move off the property by a uniformed security guard one millimetre further up this food chain. </p> <p>As one says to Maya, their uniforms announce them as the Untouchables of whitecollar America, they are the Invisibles. As they hunch by the lifts, gouging irritants and bits of grit out of the elevator door tracks, all the lawyers and accountants simply step over them and look through them, schooled in the taboos of the unacknowledged caste system. </p> <p>Below stairs, the story is very different. The cleaners are only too visible, terrorised by their watchful supervisor, Perez, a horribly convincing study in bullying from George Lopez, a stand-up comic making a superb debut in a serious role. Writer Paul Laverty gives him a scene of almost unwatchable nastiness in which Perez fires an elderly cleaning woman for being two minutes late for her shift, and refuses to listen to her tearful pleas for mercy - while all the other cleaners look away, ashamed of their failure to intervene. It is a moment of towering, almost Dickensian cruelty. Loach is not afraid to pull the throttle out all the way for moments like these, and the scene works. </p> <p>Contrary to first impressions, there are subtle moments in Loach's film, genial moments of wit, and tenderness: some looks and smiles. But this is a film with a mission, and its emotional and political register often gets turned up awfully high. Maya rages that the USA is the richest country in the world, and yet won't pay its humblest workers a decent wage. It reminded me of the smug plutocrat in a late 60s New Yorker cartoon: \"I feel very proud to live in a country rich enough to have war and peace at the same time.\" Now in 2001, there's a new spin.

Globalisation is an issue that now exercises the political classes of both left and right: there is hand-wringing across the board at the prospect of a decreasing number of inexorably growing, merging corporations effortlessly pricing local firms out of each and every market and using the mendicant populations from developing nations for a lower wage bill. But if something is seriously to be done about it, is there an alternative to the unsophisticated, d\u00e9mod\u00e9 business of trade union organisation? </p> <p>Whatever the answer, Loach has made an engaging, enjoyable and provocative movie about the human injustices of race, sex and class accumulating in the new 21st century order.

      "body": "<p>A telephone call on Wednesday from a farm neighbouring ours raised the stakes around here once more. One of their sheep had blisters on its mouth and appeared very unwell. The Maff office had been informed.</p> <p>So the waiting began for all of us, again. I'm not sure which is worse, the knowing or the waiting. Both are exceedingly unpleasant and exhausting to go through day in, day out, especially after so many weeks of uncertainty and worry. It took two phone calls from the farm to Maff before a vet was sent out: the ministry said it had no record of the first call. Communication glitches like this help nobody.</p> <p>The ewe in question was running a temperature of 104 degrees and the farm was cleared just before bedtime. After a thorough check by the Maff vet, all was pronounced well. The highly restrictive A notice (nothing or no one goes in or out except under licence), put on as soon as the vet was sent for, was cancelled, the children were finally allowed back in and there was an enormous sigh of relief from both their farmhouse and ours. They had telephoned us, and again we'd decided to keep quiet about it, as the rural rumour machine is already overworked.</p> <p>What helped clinch the all-clear verdict was the fact that there had been no sudden deaths among their new lambs. When foot and mouth is present, the sudden death of lambs aged eight to 10 days is common, as the virus brings about an instantaneous and fatal heart attack.</p> <p>The ewe under suspicion was diagnosed as having orf, a disease which also goes by the more scientific name of contagious pustular dermatitis. It is a highly infectious virus which causes painful lesions around the mouth and sometimes on the feet. A vaccine is routinely given in many flocks.</p> <p>We had a few lambs with serious orf about 10 years ago, but they presented with unusual symptoms. Their heads swelled and it was difficult for them to eat or drink. Eventually, despite veterinary treatment, a couple of the affected animals died. It was only after I had taken the carcasses down to the veterinary investigation centre in Newcastle that we learned what was going on.

      "bodyText": "A telephone call on Wednesday from a farm neighbouring ours raised the stakes around here once more. One of their sheep had blisters on its mouth and appeared very unwell. The Maff office had been informed. So the waiting began for all of us, again. I'm not sure which is worse, the knowing or the waiting. Both are exceedingly unpleasant and exhausting to go through day in, day out, especially after so many weeks of uncertainty and worry. It took two phone calls from the farm to Maff before a vet was sent out: the ministry said it had no record of the first call. Communication glitches like this help nobody. The ewe in question was running a temperature of 104 degrees and the farm was cleared just before bedtime. After a thorough check by the Maff vet, all was pronounced well. The highly restrictive A notice (nothing or no one goes in or out except under licence), put on as soon as the vet was sent for, was cancelled, the children were finally allowed back in and there was an enormous sigh of relief from both their farmhouse and ours. They had telephoned us, and again we'd decided to keep quiet about it, as the rural rumour machine is already overworked. What helped clinch the all-clear verdict was the fact that there had been no sudden deaths among their new lambs. When foot and mouth is present, the sudden death of lambs aged eight to 10 days is common, as the virus brings about an instantaneous and fatal heart attack. The ewe under suspicion was diagnosed as having orf, a disease which also goes by the more scientific name of contagious pustular dermatitis. It is a highly infectious virus which causes painful lesions around the mouth and sometimes on the feet. A vaccine is routinely given in many flocks. We had a few lambs with serious orf about 10 years ago, but they presented with unusual symptoms. Their heads swelled and it was difficult for them to eat or drink. Eventually, despite veterinary treatment, a couple of the affected animals died. It was only after I had taken the carcasses down to the veterinary investigation centre in Newcastle that we learned what was going on. The rest of the affected lambs were vaccinated and they eventually recovered. Orf can be carried from one batch of animals to another via contamination of the shepherd's hands or clothes. It can affect humans painfully. I can't help wondering if some of the flocks recently diagnosed as having foot and mouth were, in fact, suffering from orf, and were culled mistakenly. Archie, our stalwart lambing shepherd, finishes tonight. He has worked tirelessly for four and a half weeks with no days off, and we are very grateful for both his help and his good company - he has the knack of cracking jokes to lighten the atmosphere during even the darkest days.

Success would bring a roll-out of the service to the 2,000 Bass pubs across the country. \"Anyone who has had to take time off work to wait in for a delivery, or wasted a weekend tracking down parcels by post, is sure to appreciate this new service,\" said Adam Martin, marketing director of the hospitality group. Mr Martin admitted Bass hopes to convert people who pick up their parcels at the pub into customers, but insisted that the service was intended to be attractive to all web shoppers and not just those people who like to prop up the bar. Goods can be ordered from some 20 companies including Freeserve, eBay UK and Clearly Business, the Barclays bank and Freeserve business portal. Parcel size is restricted: they have to be small enough to be stored at the pub. Customers will be charged \u00a31 for delivery to the bar but be given a voucher offering 50p off the price of a drink. \"Ordering over the internet is often the easy bit while waiting in for your parcel is time consuming, frustrating and defeats the original objective,\" said Sarah Hemstedt, the marketing director of Delivery Networks. \"The flexibility of this new service will have great appeal.\"",

      "body": "<p>Trapped in his Belgrade prison cell, Slobodan Milosevic can only watch in impotence as Yugoslavia continues to unravel. The process which he bears more responsibility than any other Balkan leader for starting is not moving with as much blood or speed as when he was in power. But it is just as irrevocable. In parliamentary elections last Sunday roughly 56% of Montenegro's voters (on a high turn-out of 80%) supported parties which campaigned to break with Serbia and go for independence. In Kosovo the drafting of an interim constitution which will give the one-time Serbian province a parliament and president was moving towards its climax this week.</p> <p>In this new period of slow-motion change in the Balkans, western policy is more coherent than it was when images of war and human catastrophe dominated the front pages, demanding action. But there is still a surprising amount of confusion. If the tendency then was to respond late and feebly when emergency measures to stop the killing were needed, now the first reflex is to go against the flow even when it is peaceful and democratic.</p> <p>It took only a few hours after Vojislav Kostunica's election to the Yugoslav presidency last autumn for it to become clear that the Montenegrin government was not going to give up its drive for independence. During the Milosevic era western leaders had assumed it was his manipulation and bullying which alienated most Montenegrins. Once democracy revived in Serbia, the expectation was that they would return to the fold. The opposite happened. Milosevic's threats to use the Yugoslav army against the pro-independence movement had acted as a deterrent but they were also a goad. When the new Yugoslav president wisely lifted the threat of force, the Montenegrins were emboldened to escape while they could. After all, for several years they had been tempted with the charms of independence by the west itself, which wanted them to assert as much autonomy from Milosevic's Belgrade as possible. The west helped Montenegro to break from the Serbian economy by introducing the Deutschmark as its official currency. During the Kosovo crisis Montenegro's leaders were offered constant trips to foreign summits with all the trappings of independent status.</p> <p>The elections last weekend were the first test of support for independence in the post-Milosevic era. They did not produce as big a victory for President Milo Djukanovic as he hoped. Over-confidence let his campaign organisers down, as did heavy funding from Belgrade for the opposition. But western diplomats are wrong to focus on the narrow margin of 2% by which Djukanovic's coalition emerged as the largest force in parliament.</p> <p>The pro-independence Liberals and three Albanian parties also did well, amounting to a de facto vote for secession of 56.5% . Such totals are often called landslides, and Robin Cook and other western officials, who rushed to Podgorica this week to claim stalemate, urge delay, and threaten the government with aid cuts, would have done better to analyse things coolly.</p> <p>Djukanovic will certainly have difficulties with a fully-fledged referendum on independence. The opposition may call for a boycott, leaving it hard to get the required 50% turn-out. In parliament he does not have the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution. But a Yes vote will give him a moral case which will be hard to resist if his side gets as big a margin as it did in Sunday's general election.</p> <p>Some western opponents of Montenegrin independence argue that one must be nice to Kostunica. Without Montenegro, Yugoslavia disappears and the president loses his job. But Kostunica already has his eye on the Serbian presidency and he is still popular enough to win it if elections are held soon. Others fear the final dissolution of Yugoslavia would make Kosovo independent by default. If there is a good argument for being careful about Montenegrin independence, it is neither of these. The risk is of violence within Montenegro itself which could be provoked from ei ther side, by a pro-independence majority which feels unfairly denied just as much as by a pro-Yugoslav minority which wants to hang on to the status quo. The danger of bloodshed is small but western policy would do better to concentrate on this rather than the false strategic problems for the region which it claims to see. The west should be neutral about independence but make it clear it will put enough observers in place to monitor the referendum's fairness and ensure its results are implemented non-violently and through negotiation, both inside Montenegro and between Podgorica and Belgrade.</p> <p>On Kosovo, by contrast, western policy appears to be getting back in line with the democratic aspirations of the majority. The draft has not yet been made public but reports suggest the new \"legal framework\" for the territory which is being worked out by the UN administrator, Hans Haekkerup, and local Albanian leaders will give the Albanians most of what they have been asking. After first taking the minimalist approach, it now seems that western governments are willing to let Kosovo have a president rather than a chief executive, a parliament rather than an assembly, and even an interim constitution. Haekkerup or his UN successor will have the final say in the most sensitive areas of policy just as his internationally-appointed counterpart does in Bosnia, even though Bosnia is a nominally independent state. These two Balkan protectorates are doomed to last for a long time.</p> <p>But Kosovo will get the symbols of sovereignty and these matter as an incentive to responsible self-government. They also imply that the territory can never be part of Serbia again - a de facto guarantee of what every Kosovo Albanian wants. The main obstacle to signing the new document is the Albanian leaders' demand for it to include a promise of a referendum on independence in the foreseeable future.

      "bodyText": "Trapped in his Belgrade prison cell, Slobodan Milosevic can only watch in impotence as Yugoslavia continues to unravel. The process which he bears more responsibility than any other Balkan leader for starting is not moving with as much blood or speed as when he was in power. But it is just as irrevocable. In parliamentary elections last Sunday roughly 56% of Montenegro's voters (on a high turn-out of 80%) supported parties which campaigned to break with Serbia and go for independence. In Kosovo the drafting of an interim constitution which will give the one-time Serbian province a parliament and president was moving towards its climax this week. In this new period of slow-motion change in the Balkans, western policy is more coherent than it was when images of war and human catastrophe dominated the front pages, demanding action. But there is still a surprising amount of confusion. If the tendency then was to respond late and feebly when emergency measures to stop the killing were needed, now the first reflex is to go against the flow even when it is peaceful and democratic. It took only a few hours after Vojislav Kostunica's election to the Yugoslav presidency last autumn for it to become clear that the Montenegrin government was not going to give up its drive for independence. During the Milosevic era western leaders had assumed it was his manipulation and bullying which alienated most Montenegrins. Once democracy revived in Serbia, the expectation was that they would return to the fold. The opposite happened. Milosevic's threats to use the Yugoslav army against the pro-independence movement had acted as a deterrent but they were also a goad. When the new Yugoslav president wisely lifted the threat of force, the Montenegrins were emboldened to escape while they could. After all, for several years they had been tempted with the charms of independence by the west itself, which wanted them to assert as much autonomy from Milosevic's Belgrade as possible. The west helped Montenegro to break from the Serbian economy by introducing the Deutschmark as its official currency. During the Kosovo crisis Montenegro's leaders were offered constant trips to foreign summits with all the trappings of independent status. The elections last weekend were the first test of support for independence in the post-Milosevic era. They did not produce as big a victory for President Milo Djukanovic as he hoped. Over-confidence let his campaign organisers down, as did heavy funding from Belgrade for the opposition. But western diplomats are wrong to focus on the narrow margin of 2% by which Djukanovic's coalition emerged as the largest force in parliament. The pro-independence Liberals and three Albanian parties also did well, amounting to a de facto vote for secession of 56.5% . Such totals are often called landslides, and Robin Cook and other western officials, who rushed to Podgorica this week to claim stalemate, urge delay, and threaten the government with aid cuts, would have done better to analyse things coolly. Djukanovic will certainly have difficulties with a fully-fledged referendum on independence. The opposition may call for a boycott, leaving it hard to get the required 50% turn-out. In parliament he does not have the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution. But a Yes vote will give him a moral case which will be hard to resist if his side gets as big a margin as it did in Sunday's general election. Some western opponents of Montenegrin independence argue that one must be nice to Kostunica. Without Montenegro, Yugoslavia disappears and the president loses his job. But Kostunica already has his eye on the Serbian presidency and he is still popular enough to win it if elections are held soon. Others fear the final dissolution of Yugoslavia would make Kosovo independent by default. If there is a good argument for being careful about Montenegrin independence, it is neither of these. The risk is of violence within Montenegro itself which could be provoked from ei ther side, by a pro-independence majority which feels unfairly denied just as much as by a pro-Yugoslav minority which wants to hang on to the status quo. The danger of bloodshed is small but western policy would do better to concentrate on this rather than the false strategic problems for the region which it claims to see. The west should be neutral about independence but make it clear it will put enough observers in place to monitor the referendum's fairness and ensure its results are implemented non-violently and through negotiation, both inside Montenegro and between Podgorica and Belgrade. On Kosovo, by contrast, western policy appears to be getting back in line with the democratic aspirations of the majority. The draft has not yet been made public but reports suggest the new \"legal framework\" for the territory which is being worked out by the UN administrator, Hans Haekkerup, and local Albanian leaders will give the Albanians most of what they have been asking. After first taking the minimalist approach, it now seems that western governments are willing to let Kosovo have a president rather than a chief executive, a parliament rather than an assembly, and even an interim constitution. Haekkerup or his UN successor will have the final say in the most sensitive areas of policy just as his internationally-appointed counterpart does in Bosnia, even though Bosnia is a nominally independent state. These two Balkan protectorates are doomed to last for a long time. But Kosovo will get the symbols of sovereignty and these matter as an incentive to responsible self-government. They also imply that the territory can never be part of Serbia again - a de facto guarantee of what every Kosovo Albanian wants. The main obstacle to signing the new document is the Albanian leaders' demand for it to include a promise of a referendum on independence in the foreseeable future. That is not something which Haekkerup has a mandate to give, or the security council over Russian, Chinese, and some western governments' objections will currently accept. The Albanians were being given this tough message on their visit to Brussels yesterday. In natural justice it is certainly unfair that Montenegro, where opinion is more narrowly split on the issue, should have a right to independence while Kosovo, where opinion is heavily in favour, should be required to forego it and remain in a constitutional vacuum. But it is even more unfair for Serbia to \"lose\" both territories. The fault for that double loss is not the Kosovans' or the Montenegrins'. It rests with the man in the Belgrade prison, and the large section of the Serbian electorate which supported his decade of futile wars. jonathan.steele@theguardian.com",

In the smaller companies' universe, Scoot.com rose 2.25p to 11.25p on rumours that it is close to selling Loot, the classified advertising business it bought last year for \u00a3178m, to an overseas bidder. Scoot is under pressure to sell the business to boost its dwindling cash reserves. Elsewhere, video-phone specialist Motion Media finished unchanged at 94.5p despite talk that an important announcement, possibly concerning BT, is on the way.",

Drug push for AstraZeneca A strong US launch of ulcer drug Nexium helped AstraZeneca, Britain's second biggest pharmaceuticals company, increase its first-quarter profits by 12% to $1.11bn (\u00a3770m). Nexium snatched 3% of the multi-billion dollar US market for acid disorders in just three weeks. The product is crucial for AstraZeneca, because it replaces off-patent ulcer drug Losec, which accounts for more than a third of group sales. The company warned its profits would decline in the second quarter as sales of Losec drop. Boeing plane may fly early Boeing said its \u00a36bn project to develop a \"sonic cruiser\", which would cut four hours of the 22-hour journey from London to Sydney, could be launched as early as next year.

      "bodyText": "France was plunged into constitutional confusion yesterday after a judge probing Jacques Chirac's alleged role in a vast kickback scam at Paris town hall was forced to drop his case despite having uncovered \"serious and consistent evidence\" implicating the president. Judge Eric Halphen, who caused uproar last month by summoning Mr Chirac for questioning as a witness in the scandal, concluded he was not competent to proceed against Mr Chirac because the head of state enjoys immunity from prosecution as long as he remains in office. In a formal memorandum to the justice ministry, he said he was shelving his inquiry into Mr Chirac's alleged part in the scam although \"there now exists evidence making it probable that Jacques Chirac could have participated, as author or accomplice, in offences under the law\". The judge said only the high court of justice could now examine the accusations against Mr Chirac. Arnaud Montebourg, a Socialist deputy, has been trying for some months to bring the president before the high court. He has so far made little headway since, despite the large leftwing majority in the National Assembly, the Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin - Mr Chirac's likely rival in next year's presidential elections - does not want to appear to be making political capital out of what is essentially a judicial problem. \"But what force do our words carry if we fail to react to the probability that a person who has broken the law is now our head of state?\" asked Mr Montebourg yesterday. \"We have to confront this situation as the American people had to confront Richard Nixon's involvement in Watergate.\" Judge Halphen is leading an inquiry into allegations that during Mr Chirac's 18-year tenure as mayor in the 1980s and early 1990s, Paris city hall creamed \u00a360m off public building contracts, most of it being used to fund the president's party, the RPR. The judge's main evidence against Mr Chirac - who has refused to appear as a witness, and repeatedly denied his involvement in any of the six Paris sleaze scandals currently under investigation - comes from testimony by a former RPR fundraiser, Jean-Claude M\u00e9ry, and a former senior official of the city's public housing department, Fran\u00e7ois Ciolina. Mr M\u00e9ry, who died in 1999, said in a video confession taped in 1996 but released last year that the covert fundraising system was run \"exclusively on Mr Chirac's orders\" and that the then mayor of Paris had been present when a contractor handed over \u00a3500,000 to another RPR official. Mr Ciolina said the sums mentioned were \"credible\" and that several building contractors had told him that \"to win contracts, you had to deposit cash in the mayor's office\". He described Mr Chirac as both the inspiration for the scam and its main beneficiary. Under normal circumstances, such specific accusations would lead automatically to a suspect being placed under formal investigation. The president's immunity \"for the duration of his office\" was, however, confirmed in a controversial ruling by France's constitutional council in January 1999. Mr Halphen is now the second judge to abandon proceedings against Mr Chirac. In 1999, judge Patrick Desmure, who is investigating allegations that Paris town hall gave well-paid but non-existent jobs to dozens of RPR party activists, dropped his case \"in view of the office of president currently occupied by Jacques Chirac\".",

      "body": "<p>Children are playing in the ruins of the old factory while the family cow grazes on the weeds growing out of a pile of rubble. The water runs yellow in the ditch between the factory and the family's makeshift home, in what used to be the pesticide store. It is a tell tale sign of the 20,000 tonnes of chemicals under the thin layer of soil. </p> <p>The site - the former chemical plant at Albania's biggest port, Durres - is one of the five most contaminated \"hot spots\" in the country, according to a UN Environment Programme report published yesterday. This first ever assessment of Albania's environment has shocked even some of the experts involved in the study. </p> <p>They concluded that all 80 families living on the site are risking their lives every day. None more so than the family of Flutorime Jani, 51, whose two grandchildren, six and two, are playing in the factory puddles. They live in the former lindane store, and on hot days they have to leave their home because the vapour from the banned pesticide threatens to overwhelm them. </p> <p><strong> Vegetable plot</strong><br> </p> <p>In the ground where the family has a makeshift vegetable plot, the concentrations of lindane are up to 500 times the level which would require it to be declared hazardous waste in Britain. The milk from the cow has lindane levels 100 times above the EU safety limit, according to the report. The water from the well the family use for cooking is also contaminated. </p> <p>Mrs Jani shrugs when she is told that living at the site is illegal. \"I know that. I know it smells terribly, but where can I go? We have no choice,\" she says. \"Living here is free. Sometimes we can get casual work in Durres in the building trade.\" </p> <p>She says the family left their home village of Dibra, on the Macedonian border, because they were starving. They eventually found the empty factory and moved in. \"At least we have more money to buy food than at home, where we had nothing,\" she says. </p> <p>She concedes that all four families living in the former lindane store suffer unexplained illnesses, especially the children. She says they would like to move. but they have nowhere to go. </p> <p>Lindane and chromium VI, another dangerous chemical on the site, cause liver and kidney failure and cancer. </p> <p><strong> Raw sewage</strong><br> </p> <p>The chemicals that were once stored in Mrs Jani's new home have been moved to another store near the sea shore, but the roof leaks and the chemicals are dissolving in the rain. The smell scorches the lungs. Breathing in the fumes there could be instantly fatal, but there are no homes nearby. </p> <p>The pesticides from the contaminated area, along with the raw sewage from the city, are pumped into the sea, but there is no ban on local lobsters and crabs being sold. </p> <p>The mayor of Durres, Miri Hoti, is not sympathetic to the refugees. \"The building is not licensed; they are not permitted to live there,\" he says. \"People build all over the banned area. Most of them are refugees; how can we stop them? We have public land in clean areas to build houses, but no money. What are we to do?\" </p> <p>It is a common theme among officials. Albania has only just begun to recover from 50 years of a repressive communist regime, followed by 10 years of virtual anarchy, the collapse of the economy in a pyramid-selling scandal in 1997 and a war in neighbouring Kosovo which brought half a million refugees into the country. </p> <p>Ilir Qesja, one of three people who comprise the Durres region environment agency, says: \"You can see we have had other problems, but now with international support we can start on this one. First we had to find out the extent of the problems, and the UN has helped us do that. Now no one can claim in Albania they do not know it is dangerous. We must get the people moved, the areas fenced off. Then we must find the \u00a3150,000 it would cost to move the chemicals to a safe place. At least that would be a start.\" </p> <p>In another hot spot at Vlore, a holiday resort in the south, where 15 tonnes of PVC were made a day until 1993, there is 1,000 times the permitted level of mercury in the soil and on the beach. The vapour damages the brain, kidneys and lungs.As at Durres, more than 100 refugee families have moved on to the site and take advantage of the former factory's services by stealing its electricity and water supply. </p> <p><strong> Dioxin rain</strong><br> </p> <p>After a visit by journalists and a UN team yesterday, the mayor, Niko Veiza, has promised to stop local builders stealing highly contaminated sand from the site to build local homes and hotels, after scientists warned him that these people would unwittingly be poisoned too. </p> <p>The other three hot spots mentioned in the UN report are the capital Tirana's main rubbish dump at Sharra, which is constantly on fire and rains dioxins on the city; the Marize oilfield, where there are lakes of oil from leaks; and the badly maintained oil refinery at nearby Balsh. All need millions of pounds spent on remedial work - money which Albania has not got.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Children are playing in the ruins of the old factory while the family cow grazes on the weeds growing out of a pile of rubble. The water runs yellow in the ditch between the factory and the family's makeshift home, in what used to be the pesticide store. It is a tell tale sign of the 20,000 tonnes of chemicals under the thin layer of soil. The site - the former chemical plant at Albania's biggest port, Durres - is one of the five most contaminated \"hot spots\" in the country, according to a UN Environment Programme report published yesterday. This first ever assessment of Albania's environment has shocked even some of the experts involved in the study. They concluded that all 80 families living on the site are risking their lives every day. None more so than the family of Flutorime Jani, 51, whose two grandchildren, six and two, are playing in the factory puddles. They live in the former lindane store, and on hot days they have to leave their home because the vapour from the banned pesticide threatens to overwhelm them. Vegetable plot In the ground where the family has a makeshift vegetable plot, the concentrations of lindane are up to 500 times the level which would require it to be declared hazardous waste in Britain. The milk from the cow has lindane levels 100 times above the EU safety limit, according to the report. The water from the well the family use for cooking is also contaminated. Mrs Jani shrugs when she is told that living at the site is illegal. \"I know that. I know it smells terribly, but where can I go? We have no choice,\" she says. \"Living here is free. Sometimes we can get casual work in Durres in the building trade.\" She says the family left their home village of Dibra, on the Macedonian border, because they were starving. They eventually found the empty factory and moved in. \"At least we have more money to buy food than at home, where we had nothing,\" she says. She concedes that all four families living in the former lindane store suffer unexplained illnesses, especially the children. She says they would like to move. but they have nowhere to go. Lindane and chromium VI, another dangerous chemical on the site, cause liver and kidney failure and cancer. Raw sewage The chemicals that were once stored in Mrs Jani's new home have been moved to another store near the sea shore, but the roof leaks and the chemicals are dissolving in the rain. The smell scorches the lungs. Breathing in the fumes there could be instantly fatal, but there are no homes nearby. The pesticides from the contaminated area, along with the raw sewage from the city, are pumped into the sea, but there is no ban on local lobsters and crabs being sold. The mayor of Durres, Miri Hoti, is not sympathetic to the refugees. \"The building is not licensed; they are not permitted to live there,\" he says. \"People build all over the banned area. Most of them are refugees; how can we stop them? We have public land in clean areas to build houses, but no money. What are we to do?\" It is a common theme among officials. Albania has only just begun to recover from 50 years of a repressive communist regime, followed by 10 years of virtual anarchy, the collapse of the economy in a pyramid-selling scandal in 1997 and a war in neighbouring Kosovo which brought half a million refugees into the country. Ilir Qesja, one of three people who comprise the Durres region environment agency, says: \"You can see we have had other problems, but now with international support we can start on this one. First we had to find out the extent of the problems, and the UN has helped us do that. Now no one can claim in Albania they do not know it is dangerous. We must get the people moved, the areas fenced off. Then we must find the \u00a3150,000 it would cost to move the chemicals to a safe place. At least that would be a start.\" In another hot spot at Vlore, a holiday resort in the south, where 15 tonnes of PVC were made a day until 1993, there is 1,000 times the permitted level of mercury in the soil and on the beach. The vapour damages the brain, kidneys and lungs.As at Durres, more than 100 refugee families have moved on to the site and take advantage of the former factory's services by stealing its electricity and water supply. Dioxin rain After a visit by journalists and a UN team yesterday, the mayor, Niko Veiza, has promised to stop local builders stealing highly contaminated sand from the site to build local homes and hotels, after scientists warned him that these people would unwittingly be poisoned too. The other three hot spots mentioned in the UN report are the capital Tirana's main rubbish dump at Sharra, which is constantly on fire and rains dioxins on the city; the Marize oilfield, where there are lakes of oil from leaks; and the badly maintained oil refinery at nearby Balsh. All need millions of pounds spent on remedial work - money which Albania has not got.",

      "bodyText": "The Ukrainian prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, was forced out of office yesterday by communist MPs backed by big business, throwing the country into confusion. The resignation of the country's most trusted politician cut short his attempts to end corruption and pursue pro-western policies, and consolidated the power of the widely discredited president, Leonid Kuchma. It also boosted the Russian strategy of drawing former Soviet states back into Moscow's orbit and polarising Ukraine between the pro-Russian east and the nationalist west. But, out of office, Mr Yushchenko is expected to exploit the crisis and his enhanced popularity to lead the opposition to President Kuchma. \"I am not abandoning politics; I am leaving in order to return,\" he said Yuliya Tymoshenko, the opposition leader whom Mr Kuchma sacked as deputy prime minister in January, immediately invited Mr Yushchenko to lead her campaign against the president. Ukraine's polarisation was evident in the heart of the capital Kiev yesterday. As MPs gathered in parliament to pass the vote of no confidence in the prime minister, thousands of Mr Yushchenko's supporters were outside demanding Mr Kuchma's impeachment. The president has been under attack since the publication of details from a tape recording purportedly revealing him ordering the rigging of elections in 1999 and authorising the murder of a journalist last year. The no-confidence vote was carried by a 263 to 69. Mr Yushchenko's opponents accused him of leading the country into economic ruin, even though last year he gave Ukraine its first economic growth in the 10 years since its independence from the former Soviet Union. \"Democracy in Ukraine has suffered a serious defeat,\" he said. \"The political elite ... showed itself unable to accept a legal economy and public politics.\" Although the communists have long been opposed to Mr Yushchenko's government, the no-confidence vote would have failed without the backing of the centrist parties, which are beholden to the millionaire clan leaders who dominate Ukraine's notoriously corrupt public life, and the tacit assent of Mr Kuchma, who appointed Mr Yushchenko prime minister at the end of 1999. It came after months of demonstrations, sackings, and occasional violence triggered by the secret tape revelations, allegedly from Mr Kuchma's office, but it was seen not merely as another government tussle but as a signpost to the future direction of the biggest country in eastern Europe. One of Mr Yushchenko's supporters in parliament, Vasili Chervony, said the choice facing the parliament was not for or against the prime minister, but \"for Russia or for Europe\". \"The KGB men in the Kremlin are re-assembling their empire.\" Given the threats to his position, Mr Kuchma appears to be battening down the hatches and making concessions to the industrial oligarchs who run Ukraine and feared that Mr Yushchenko's economic reforms would imperil their control of key national assets. He sought to distance himself from the row, refusing to support Mr Yushchenko before the vote, and after it blaming him for being unwilling to make compromises. Mr Yushchenko was under strong pressure to give cabinet seats to several oligarchs' supporters, but he refused to make changes which would have neutered his policies. If western diplomats in Kiev were hugely dismayed by yesterday's events, Moscow was quietly satisfied. Following the recent election triumph of pro-Moscow communists in neighbouring Moldova, the downfall of Mr Yushchenko helps to surround President Vladimir Putin with broadly supportive regimes. Privately, Russian diplomats are even suggesting that Ukraine may yet ask to join the Russia-Belarus union, although this seems far-fetched, since the union is a feeble con struct and membership would polarise Ukraine even more completely. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, summed up Moscow's view of the crisis by claiming that Mr Yushchenko was supported only by \"extreme nationalists\" and his government was at the mercy of \"western arm-twisting\". Ukrainian opinion polls show Mr Yushchenko to be easily the most popular and most trusted politician in the country, and 4m signatures were collected supporting him and opposing yesterday's no-confidence vote.",

AE2, captained by an Irishman, Henry \"Dacre\" Stoker, an eccentric more interested in polo than naval matters, became the first vessel to breach the Dardanelles - that turbulent stretch of water leading from the Aegean into the Sea of Marmara and on to Constantinople - to attack Turkey, Germany's ally.</p> <p>The AE2, an unreliable submarine from the infant navy of a new country, with a crew regarded as amateurs by the more experienced British and French submariners, had succeeded where all others had failed.</p> <p>Then, for reasons unexplained until now, the AE2's triumph slipped into the dustbin of history. Few Australians and Britons even know that there was an Australian submarine fighting against Turkey, much less its mission. AE2 was, it now appears, a victim of first world war \"spin\".</p> <p>In 1915, with the fight against Germany bogged down on the Western Front, Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, came up with a bold plan. Allied warships would breach the Dardanelles, land Allied troops at Gallipoli and knock Turkey out of the war. The Allies could then attack Germany through the Balkans and take the pressure off Russia, struggling to hold Germany on the Eastern Front. The plan aroused great expectations - a popular poem of the time read: Cease your preaching! Load your guns!/Their roar our mission tells,/The day is come from Britain's sons/To seize the Dardanelles.</p> <p>But it all went terribly wrong. Mines and Turkish guns in the Dardanelles accounted for three Allied battleships and several hundred men. Submarines from Britain and France tried to sneak through but did not make it. Then AE2 found a way through the mines and past the forts, surprising everyone, Stoker included.</p> <p>He had applied for a transfer from the Royal Navy to the Australian Navy because he had heard a rumour that in Sydney there was a rich Australian who sponsored impecunious polo players like him. This turned out to be untrue but by then Stoker and his fellow officers were enjoying life in Australia and the challenge of mastering the unreliable submarine technology of the time - the Royal Navy had launched its first submarine only in 1901.</p> <p>They must have been one of the most literary bunch ever to grace a submarine's mess. Stoker was a cousin of Bram Stoker, author of Dracula. Lieutenant Geoffrey Haggard was a nephew of Rider Haggard, author of King Solomon's Mines, and Lieutenant John Cary's brother was Joyce Cary, author of The Horse's Mouth.</p> <p>In the early hours of April 25 1915, just as Allied troops were being shuffled from ships to landing barges for the assault on Gallipoli, AE2 entered the Dardanelles for a last-ditch attempt. Its orders: \"Generally run amuk [sic] at the Narrows - if you get there.\" It did. For the next five days, although short of air, dogged by mechanical failure and forced to lie silent on the bottom while Turkish warships steamed back and forth overhead, it created havoc in the Turkish high command.</p> <p>It torpedoed only one Turkish ship - thus revealing its presence to the enemy - but it was the threat it represented that worried the Turks. How did it get past the minefields? How many torpedoes did it carry? Was it the only Allied submarine behind Turkish lines? Was it safe to continue to supply the Turkish forces at Gallipoli by sea? Stoker hastened to signal his success.</p> <p>On land everything had gone sour for the Allies from the very beginning. The Royal Navy had got the troops on to the beaches - the Australians were led ashore in many cases by teenage British midshipmen, one of whom was still only 13. But some of the landings had been on the wrong beaches, the terrain was hostile, the Turks had rushed up reinforcements and within hours the Allies were in danger of being pushed back into the sea.</p> <p>The commander, General Sir Ian Hamilton, was seriously considering a withdrawal when the signal arrived from the AE2. A British naval officer told Hamilton: \"This is an omen. An Australian submarine has done the finest feat in submarine history and is going to torpedo all the ships bringing reinforcements, supplies and ammunition into Gallipoli.\"</p> <p>There is disagreement whether this swung Hamilton's decision, but he then issued his famous \"dig yourselves in and stick it out\" order to his troops. The next day there was a notice nailed to a tree stump on shore reading: \"Australian sub AE2 just through the Dardanelles. Advance Australia!\" So the Allied troops were not evacuated until eight months later, by which time casualties on both sides had reached more than 250,000. A feeling then grew that the timing of AE2's signal was a tragedy. Stoker himself said: \"The receipt of our signal stopped the Anzacs being withdrawn that night ... Maybe an immediate evacuation would have saved those terrible casualties.\"</p> <p>As for the AE2, its luck ran out on April 30. It had to keep popping to the surface to get fresh air and to see where it was - once, she surfaced so close to a Turkish fort that the Turks could not depress their guns sufficiently to fire on her. It had run aground several times and been rammed by a Turkish gunboat one-tenth of her size. Now the submarine found herself on the surface holed in three places and therefore unable to dive again. So Stoker scuttled her. The crew took to the water, where they were quickly picked up by the Turks, and they spent the rest of the war in captivity.</p> <p>The Gallipoli campaign had been a disaster. To tell the story of the AE2's achievement would have involved assessing the importance of her signal on Hamilton's decision to fight on, rather than save lives and evacuate that first day. Far better to concentrate on the bravery and fortitude of the troops. So the authorities pushed the story of the gallant Anzacs and this soon obliterated the navy and the AE2.</p> <p>Then, in 1994, two Australian authors, Fred and Elizabeth Brenchley, learned that the Turks were searching the Sea of Marmara for the AE2. While the search went on, the Brenchleys looked into the submarine's history. When the wreck was located in July 1998, their book, Stoker's Submarine, was already well under way - it was published in Australia by HarperCollins this week.</p> <p>Stoker, they learned, had gone on to a successful postwar career on the West End and Broadway stage as an actor and a playwright, and later wrote scripts for radio, TV and films. He served in the RN in the second world war, became croquet champion of Ireland aged 77 and died in London in 1966, aged 81.</p> <p>Now there are moves in Australia and Turkey to raise AE2 and put it on display in Istanbul, perhaps alongside the Australian war memorial. The Brenchleys say it could become a magnet for the thousands who go to Turkey each April to visit the Gallipoli landing site, \"a symbol of the permanent co-operation between former enemies\".</p>",

Most hurtful of all was that he fell in love with her. He also says he loves me and wants to stay with me. We have had lengthy discussions and I realise I had neglected him and taken him for granted. We went away for a weekend and our sexual relationship has been fantastic, returning to a mature honeymoon state. We have agreed to try again and my husband has promised not to see this other woman. But I am a mess inside. I can't even confide in my best friend and certainly not my three adult children. I don't want to visit Relate but desperately want advice. Can our marriage work? Can I trust him again? Am I mad to let him stay? \u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday. Each week we publish a letter to which readers are invited to respond. Replies should reach us by Thursday.

When I ask him what cultural line the ANC has adopted since coming to power, he replies: \"TV and casinos.\" Then, in mock terror, he shouts: \"I'm going to jail.

But he is equally exasperated by South African TV, which, with rare exceptions, conforms to a homogenised western formula. \"It is not that black people working in TV don't want to show who they are,\" he says. \"They don't know who they are.\" </p> <p>Masekela's gloomy assessment of the cultural climate provides a discordant note to the six-week Celebrate South Africa festival, which will see a host of the country's brightest talents performing in London. \"The black intelligentsia need to tell [the government] what they are doing wrong,\" he says. \"When we had the most draconian rulers we were prepared to speak out, go to jail. But people don't want to speak out.\" </p> <p>What is there to speak out about? Well, apart from Masekela's complaint that \"in other countries people dress up to go out, but we dress up to stay at home\" - a reference to the perceived lawlessness of some areas - the arguments are, predictably, about whose culture is being neglected and which unfavourably favoured. Many black South Africans feel that their long-suppressed cultures should now be a prime concern of the government. \"But every year,\" Masekela says, \"when the budget comes up the dispensation for the arts decreases.\" </p> <p>Masekela's artistic anguish and doubt is not typical of black South Africans; the overwhelming impression you bring away from the townships and settlements is one of astounding confidence and hope and pride in the success of their uniquely civilised revolution. </p> <p>Meanwhile a white minority is incensed by the government's refusal to continue bailing out national classical orchestras or maintain a level of support for ballet and opera. (One white South African has a brisk solution for the white culture dilemma: \"Have your classical concerts and ballet,\" says Eve Gray, a publishing consultant, \"but make them work. I saw a performance of Wagner with a black township chorus. It added a new dimension to the work.\") </p> <p>Some white South Africans are convinced that the ANC is actually intent on stifling white art, a belief reinforced by events such as last week's Nadine Gordimer incident. A committee of teachers appointed by the education department of Gauteng province were accused of \"political correctness gone mad\" when they accused Gordimer's July's People of being \"deeply racist, superior and patronising\". Although the education minister immediately accused the teachers of being \"ill informed and pedagogically unsound\" and sent his apologies to Gordimer, the apprehension still smoulders. </p> <p>The ANC government goes to some lengths to present itself as a patron of the arts, remembering the central role of the world's artistic community in persuading foreign governments to take a stand against apartheid. Indigenous art adorns the country's constitutional court building. </p> <p>Albie Sachs, the former ANC activist who lost an arm in a car bomb planted by agents of the South African security forces, is now one of the country's constitutional judges. He took on the job of what he calls \"decorator\" for the court, filling the vestibule and corridors with South African artworks.\"We were engaged in turning our country from the polecat of the world into a distinctive democracy,\" he says. \"We rented this office block. We had little money so had to rely on people's generosity and passion, energy and madness - all kinds of emotions not normally associated with a court of law.\" </p> <p>The result is that the blind lady with the scales is replaced by a high panel of a solemn figure, flattened hands upraised in a gesture suggesting both the lifting of a burden and a restrained gesture of jubilation. Corridor after corridor reflects the tumultuous experiences, griefs and hopes of the country. Madness is represented by a kind of quixotic, generously hung witchdoctor apparently gibbering before solemn Justice. \"This is the latest addition,\" Sachs explains. \"If we had put it in first you can imagine how the good judges would have freaked.\" </p> <p>Brigitte Mabandla, deputy minister responsible for the arts, insisted the ANC had merely diverted funds from costly buildings and bureaucracy to on-the-ground performances, as well as redirecting more money to the townships. In the townships, though, few are convinced that they are likely to be properly supported. Many in the arts world also point out that the ministry now responsible for the arts is also responsible for science and technology - it isn't difficult, they say, to see where the spending priorities will be in a developing nation. </p> <p> Even with far greater sums of money than the South African government has at its disposal, one or more of the country's numerous ethnic groups (and 11 official languages) would undoubtedly feel neglected. Khumalo and Masekela, who have now devoted themselves to promoting indigenous music, fear that they are very vulnerable to being swallowed up by western cultures. \"One problem,\" Masekela says, \"is that the whites can't think of themselves as African.\" </p> <p>But artists such as Masekela and Khumalo face a further obstacle: black opposition to indigenous culture. \"If you want to appreciate these cultures,\" Khumalo says, \"it is seen as tribalism or promoting ethnicity.\" </p> <p>This does not discourage all entrepreneurial spirit.

When Athol Fugard brought out a book of poetic memoirs, it had little to do with politics. But the public saw the name Fugard, equated it with struggle literature, and did not buy. Some say that the literature was not very democratic anyway; it was intellectuals telling people what they should think.

In it, two village women sit in a cottage belonging to \"her fart-ass majesty\" who only comes down from London to live in the place at the weekend (when she's not nipping to Bangladesh to buy rugs). The BBC, it seems, want to use the place as a location for Miss Marple. </p> <p>\"They want this place here. A typical cottage they thought it were, right. I offered them my place but they weren't happy with the double glazing and the satellite dish.\" </p> <p>According to British Home Stories, two-thirds of people who don't live in the country would like to. I imagine this survey - most likely done in the office of the production company making the documentary - was carried out before the big livestock bonfires filled the air with the stench of burning cow and carcinogenics. But even if it wasn't, the countryside that this two-thirds dream of isn't the same countryside that people who already live there recognise. The outsiders dream of a rural idyll - first imagined by the Victorians. Like the BBC, they imagine a typical cottage to be one without double glazing and a satellite dish. They are the kind of people who pay 40 quid for a T-shirt. </p> <p>And so they were. Rachel and Richard had just bought a converted barn in Sussex for \u00a3380,000. Rachel, a solicitor, was quite happy spending three hours a day and \u00a34,000 a year commuting to and from London. (It made you wonder for whom Rachel was a solicitor - General Pinochet? The Sunday Mirror? Huw Edwards?) They were typical residents in the village of Harting, where those who have lived there all their lives now feel like outsiders. </p> <p>Cardrona, Britain's newest village which is 20 miles outside Edinburgh, is effectively a suburb without the urb. The houses are horribly new with corner baths, mirrored wardrobes and breakfast bars. Evangelical residents spoke of their decoration plans. \"That wall is going to be gold and the dining room will be chocolate with crocodile-print wallpaper,\" said one woman who has clearly taken Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen way too seriously. </p> <p>While the narrator may have been overstating it somewhat with \"We're witnessing an urban exodus\" - so when, exactly, will London become a ghost town? - British Home Stories was nonetheless engaging and persuasive both in sociological terms and as an excuse to nosey round people's houses. The middle classes' gentrification of the countryside was obvious and wholesale. Like the women who find their ideal man and set about changing him, the townies who upped sticks to the sticks set about transforming it into what they imagined it should be. </p> <p>Not that you can blame them. Just as the city is remade by television, so the country has been idyllically remodelled but to a much larger degree. From Heartbeat and Where The Heart Is through Monarch Of The Glen, Two Thousand Acres Of Skye and Ballykissangel (the last of which has the added bonus of being in Oireland) and even the slightly grubbier Down To Earth, the countryside is a green, pleasant and almost mythical land. Recently, only The Lakes has really exposed the dark underbelly of village life. Unless you count The League Of Gentlemen, of course. </p> <p>If there was a disincentive for moving to the country, bumping into Michael Watson-Smith down Asda could be it. He was selling Buckland Park for some \u00a36m, six times what he paid for it in 1993. Retired from his window box business and living alone, he made his money from property and was convinced of the virtues of old country houses (as you would be if you had made buckets of money from them). \"I love old things\", he said. \"Except for wives. They're better younger.\" Quite. </p> <p>Watson-Smith was planning on selling his Toad Hall to some Americans who were \"quite shrewd\". To demonstrate this, Mrs American said of the country pile, \"It's nicer to have bigger closets.\" You can't really argue with that but \u00a36m is an awful lot to pay for big closets, unless you're Liberace. </p> <p>Of course, having a place in the country isn't really about having a place in the country at all.

His baptism of fire came during the first Arab-Israeli war, when he successfully defended the town of Latrun, 17 miles west of Jerusalem.</p> <p>The Jewish state had declared independence on May 14 1948. The next day, the armies of five Arab nations invaded, among them the Bedouin of Transjordan's crack Arab Legion, under the supreme command of Britain's [Sir John] Glubb Pasha. They immediately secured the West Bank, then rushed to fill the vacuum created by British troops leaving Jerusalem.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Zionist Haganah forces were desperate to keep open their lines of communication with the 85,000 besieged Jews of Latrun, the epicentre of the only route linking Tel Aviv with Jerusalem. Lieutenant Colonel Majali, the first Arab to head a legion regiment, occupied a strategic hill straddling the nearby Bab al Wad (Gate to the Valley). His spies fanned the countryside, while he held a deserted British police fort, built near a Trappist monastery in 1936.</p> <p>When the Haganah attacked on May 25, Majali's Fourth Regiment was ready. Their camouflaged mortars, machine-guns and cannon caught the mainly immigrant recruits on open ground, and cut them to shreds over 15 hours. Up to 400 died and, two months before his death, Habes revealed how he had caught a young Lieutenant Ariel Sharon in the battle. The new Israeli prime minister denied the claim, but Habes was adamant. \"Sharon is like a grizzly bear,\" he grumbled. \"I captured him, I healed his wounds.\"</p> <p>On June 9, an Israeli Palmach strike-force attempted a second raid on Latrun. This, too, faltered for want of reinforcements, only yards from Majali's command post. In mid-July, he repulsed a final assault - and returned to Amman a thrice-conquering hero. He restored a modicum of pride to Arabs, for whom 1948 spelt nakba (disaster).</p> <p>Nonetheless, it was a Pyrrhic victory. Despite their losses at Latrun, the Haganah pinned down Jordanian troops who might have been fighting in Jerusalem. The Israelis also managed to build a makeshift bypass round Latrun and siphoned through vital arms, water and supplies. Majali's brigade commander, Colonel Ashton, forbade him from shelling their bulldozers. Ultimately, Jordanian troops, assisted by local Arabs, did capture the Old City and East Jerusalem, but lost West Jerusalem to Israel.</p> <p>It was in the Old City, three years later, that Habes al- Majali experienced tragedy at first-hand. For two years, he had been the private escort to King Abdullah of Jordan. Then, on July 20 1951, as he was ushering the king to prayers at the Al Aqsa mosque, Abdullah was shot dead by anti-Hashemite Palestinians.</p> <p>There were more setbacks in store. Majali backed Prince Na'if as successor to the Jordanian throne, though, in the event, his elder brother, Prince Talal, won the crown. Matters only improved after King Hussein (Obituary, February 8 1999) replaced his father, Talal, in 1953. Three years later, Glubb was dismissed, and, in 1957, Majali became chief-of-staff of the Jordanian armed forces, a post he held until June 1967.</p> <p>Majalis have long dominated Karak, an Arabian province that joined the Emirate of Transjordan in 1921. Though they originally hailed from Hebron, on the West Bank, they had integrated comfortably into Bedouin society, and resented Palestinian political agitation after 1948. Earlier, and more crucially, they had welcomed Hashemite rule in Jordan.</p> <p>Thus, as a reward for unswerving loyalty, Majalis have been prime ministers, police chiefs and speakers of the Jordanian national assembly; Habes himself served some 20 years as a senator, including a period on the foreign affairs committee. Nonetheless, he preferred martial matters to diplomatic niceties, and, as his brother-in-law, Hazza, once told the British ambassador in Amman: \"We Majalis are used to killing and being killed.\"</p> <p>Habes joined the Arab Legion in 1932, and soon impressed Glubb Pasha. Despite acquiring modern skills, he never lost his Bedouin elan. King Hussein's biographer, James Lunt, dubbed him the \"grand seigneur\" of Karak and \"beau sabreur\" of the army.</p> <p>Certainly, King Hussein found him indispensable. He ruthlessly tracked down the Hashemite ruler's Nasserite enemies during the uprising of 1958. In 1960, he restored order after pro-Syrian agents had murdered his cousin, the Jordanian prime minister, Hazaa'. Forced to relinquish overall command to Cairo on the eve of the six-day war in June 1967, and bemused by conflicting orders, he lost the West Bank to Israel. He resigned, but served as defence minister for another year.</p> <p>Majali's return to active duty was sudden and dramatic. Jordanian-based Palestinian fedayeen (guerrillas) were growing more autonomous and audacious. After terrorists destroyed four international aircraft near army headquarters at al-Zarqa, in September 1970, Hussein declared martial law, re-appointed Majali as commander-in-chief, and ordered him to crush the revolt.</p> <p>Habes did so with relish. Over 10 days, his troops routed the fedayeen; some 3,500 fighters died on both sides. He also repulsed a pro-PLO Syrian invasion - destroying half the enemy's armour in the process, and inadvertently setting off the coup that brought President al-Assad (Obituary, June 12 2000) to power in Damascus. In July 1971, the remaining PLO units in Jordan were expelled to Lebanon.</p> <p>Despite these victories, the old warhorse found it hard to forgive old enemies; in 1994, for instance, he boycotted the official ceremonies marking Jordan's peace deal with Israel. Seen as atavistic by many, he represented a somehow nobler, if not gentler, past. He is survived by seven children and 27 grandchildren; his wife Bazaa' predeceased him.</p> <p>\u0095 Habes al-Majali, soldier, born c1913; died April 22 2001</p>",

Stuff that. Sense of ownership is a con trick borrowed from pop psychology and used frequently by NHS managers to hide the unpalatable truth that both they and the \"managed\" have no real ownership at all of the system or process.</p> <p>As an ex-GP forced out by work-induced depression and limiting my comments to the GP system, I say look at Canadian Medicare which has no management structure at all for GPs. My impression is that it works at least as well, it is certainly much cheaper to administer, there are fewer GPs seriously ill with work-induced mental problems and the results are as good, if not better, than our NHS. I'm packing for my next trip to Canada where I can happily work hard as a locum GP but get the heebie-jeebies when I contemplate same in the NHS. <br><b>Declan Fox </b><br> Newtownstewart, Co Tyrone <a href=\"mailto:declan@boskone.freeserve.co.uk&quot;\">declan@boksone.freeserve.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095As one who was recently discharged, after emergency admission, from Addenbrooke's NHS Trust, still with a not fully diagnosed condition, to wait six weeks for an outpatient appointment, I think lists of \"top\" hospitals (Best in NHS is doing well says hospital survey team, April 25) may serve the needs of health professionals for a pat on the back, but are meaningless to patients. Far from feeling that my needs for a clear diagnosis were \"focused on\" or that I was in a place \"well managed\", I had the impression that here was a hospital at the very limits of its capacity, throwing me out into an equally overstretched outpatient system. <br><b>Annemarie Snodgrass </b><br> Cambridge</p> <p>\u0095Liam Fox's pre-election pledge to fund a single dose measles vaccine \"to increase the inoculation rate\" is misguided (MMR policy risks children's lives, claim Tories, April 25).

Sense of ownership is a con trick borrowed from pop psychology and used frequently by NHS managers to hide the unpalatable truth that both they and the \"managed\" have no real ownership at all of the system or process. As an ex-GP forced out by work-induced depression and limiting my comments to the GP system, I say look at Canadian Medicare which has no management structure at all for GPs. My impression is that it works at least as well, it is certainly much cheaper to administer, there are fewer GPs seriously ill with work-induced mental problems and the results are as good, if not better, than our NHS. I'm packing for my next trip to Canada where I can happily work hard as a locum GP but get the heebie-jeebies when I contemplate same in the NHS. Declan Fox Newtownstewart, Co Tyrone declan@boksone.freeserve.co.uk \u0095As one who was recently discharged, after emergency admission, from Addenbrooke's NHS Trust, still with a not fully diagnosed condition, to wait six weeks for an outpatient appointment, I think lists of \"top\" hospitals (Best in NHS is doing well says hospital survey team, April 25) may serve the needs of health professionals for a pat on the back, but are meaningless to patients. Far from feeling that my needs for a clear diagnosis were \"focused on\" or that I was in a place \"well managed\", I had the impression that here was a hospital at the very limits of its capacity, throwing me out into an equally overstretched outpatient system. Annemarie Snodgrass Cambridge \u0095Liam Fox's pre-election pledge to fund a single dose measles vaccine \"to increase the inoculation rate\" is misguided (MMR policy risks children's lives, claim Tories, April 25). Splitting up the MMR vaccine into three would mean three injection visits for each child, resulting most likely in lower, not higher, rates of protection against these diseases.

The stacks themselves were particularly suited to Monet's late impressionist approach, in that the surfaces of these great, rounded forms, and the way their surfaces trap and scatter light and shadow, was undoubtedly of as much interest to him as the splendid shapes themselves.</p> <p>The lumpy silhouettes of the stacks, mussed up by stray stalks, become indeterminate, glowing penumbras. Monet painted these shaggy, robust forms with a wonderful sense of the stuff that composed them, using an extraordinary variety of brushstrokes.</p> <p>Everything about these paintings - the stubbly, churned earth, even the sky - appears granular, turned and forked-over. Rhythms come and go in the paintwork, recalling the repetitive labour that built the stacks, as well as the painter's own efforts to record them. The texture of the world, and of the light, are as one.

      "bodyText": "The grainstacks are lurid cupcakes in slanting light. The stacks themselves were particularly suited to Monet's late impressionist approach, in that the surfaces of these great, rounded forms, and the way their surfaces trap and scatter light and shadow, was undoubtedly of as much interest to him as the splendid shapes themselves. The lumpy silhouettes of the stacks, mussed up by stray stalks, become indeterminate, glowing penumbras. Monet painted these shaggy, robust forms with a wonderful sense of the stuff that composed them, using an extraordinary variety of brushstrokes. Everything about these paintings - the stubbly, churned earth, even the sky - appears granular, turned and forked-over. Rhythms come and go in the paintwork, recalling the repetitive labour that built the stacks, as well as the painter's own efforts to record them. The texture of the world, and of the light, are as one. And as much as light reveals his subjects, it destroys them. More than this, the haystacks, sometimes seen singly, sometimes in groups, are fantastic sculptural presences. They lower and glow, they stand alone in a winter sunset, they march across the painting, casting long autumnal shadows. It would be a mistake, however, to imagine that Monet painted these works entirely on the spot. Their apparent spontaneity, their freshness, was manufactured in the studio, the work of months.
