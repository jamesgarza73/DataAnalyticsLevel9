Umpires: J H Harris and T E Jesty \u0095 There are changes in the way bonus points are earned in the millennial revision of the County Championship. As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

He played only one season of county cricket, for Nottinghamshire in 1994 when he was 26. But he had five seasons as professional at Eppleton in the Durham Senior League and spent other summers playing club cricket in Scotland, Shropshire and Surrey. England, a poet might say, shaped, made aware, gave, once her flowers to love, her ways to roam... </p> <p>\"I've played all over the place in Britain, the whole length of the M1 and way beyond. I appreciate the conditions here. I also felt at home here on my many visits. I felt settled for the first time, even though I thought I'd never get used to the weather. </p> <p>\"In the West Indies I am living out of a suitcase and rushing for different planes. Being away from home, being labelled the professional in the side, does create a sense of responsibility. To be recognised and respected I had to be consistent, to match the standards set by other professionals, week in, week out. </p> <p>\"It shaped my attitude. I had to take care of myself. I was responsible for my own performances. There was no captain or coach pushing me. </p> <p>\"Whatever the weather, I had to go out knowing that if I didn't do a job it wouldn't get done. I used to knock it around like any Caribbean player, but here I learned to discipline myself and that to play too many shots was to place the side in danger.\" </p> <p>Off the field, too, he widened his character. \"I hated being indoors during the day. So I would do any job to get me out. I got a job valeting cars and another making snooker tables. I also had to carry washing machines up tall apartment blocks with no lifts in Edinburgh, which put two inches on my shoulders.\" </p> <p>But this very serious-looking Bible reader says he came to love this job, along with all the others, including leading a rabble of a test team out of the international wilderness. </p> <p>As a player Adams, the ruminative son of a Jamaican doctor and his Canadian wife, was never a natural at this level. His parents, so the story goes, never trusted cricket and tried to push him towards university and medicine. This he dismisses. \"It's just a good bit of PR that has come out of the Caribbean. I'm happy to go along with it but it's not really the truth. They were perfectly happy that I should do whatever I wanted provided I was earning a living.\" </p> <p>Because of his all-round skills - he also bowls slow left-arm and fields well anywhere, including behind the stumps - he used to be known as Jimmy the Cricket. He first played for Jamaica in 1985 but had to wait six seasons for his maiden first-class century, one of the slowest scored in the Caribbean, and until 1992 for his first test cap. </p> <p>Carl Hooper, who is such an extravagantly gifted but unfulfilled cricketer that he could almost be Adams's alter ego, has played a significant if unwitting part in the other's promotion. It was Hooper's chipped finger which gave Adams his debut in that historic match in Bridgetown in April 1992 when South Africa returned to test cricket, Hooper's bad back which let Adams in for a good series against England in 1994, and, last year, family illness which resulted in Adams replacing him as vice-captain against Australia. In that memorable series the Jamaican was at the other end while Brian Lara played his match-winning innings in Kingston and Bridgetown. </p> <p>Adams took over the captaincy after West Indies had 10 overseas test defeats in a row, failing to win one first-class match on tours of Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand. </p> <p>In his first test in charge, in Trinidad this year, Zimbabwe needed only 99 to win on the last day. But thanks to Adams the pressure on the batsmen never relented and they were bowled out for 63. </p> <p>Then, at home at Sabina Park, Adams scored his first century for four years to set up a 10-wicket win. And, under intense pressure, his unbeaten 49 carried his side to victory in the deciding test against Pakistan. </p> <p>His performance against England in Birmingham two weeks ago was typical of the cricketer and the man: last out after steering his side from 136 for four to a tally of 397. </p> <p>\"The players know me very well. I captained some of the younger ones on an A tour. They know what I stand for. They know what I'm going to ask for. I'm not going to rant and rave but I do expect standards to be met and, if I have to, I can put a point across strongly.\" </p> <p>Adams, however, is a consensus captain, one who is constantly seeking and measuring the opinions of others. \"I try to involve everyone, with their individual strengths, as much as possible. It's one thing to ask a player to do something. But it's better if we both agree to do something. I have to make decisions but I want everyone to be involved. </p> <p>\"Now, after Birmingham, we have something to build on. I feel we've been rewarded for putting some things in place. It would not have been the end of the world if we had lost that test against Zimbabwe, or the series against Pakistan, because personal experience has told me that you learn your biggest lessons when you fall down. </p> <p>\"But I'm thankful for those results and the one at Edgbaston. And the thing that really pleased me about my 98 there was that there were decent partnerships with Franklyn Rose, Curtly Ambrose, Reon King and Courtney Walsh. That showed me that we had kept the spirit we showed in the last test against Pakistan.\" </p> <p>All we have to do now is convince ourselves that Courtney, Curtly, Sherwin, Brian and Franklyn would all be complete duffers if they had not polished their skills in county cricket and the summer might have consolations after all.</p>",

So I would do any job to get me out. I got a job valeting cars and another making snooker tables. I also had to carry washing machines up tall apartment blocks with no lifts in Edinburgh, which put two inches on my shoulders.\" But this very serious-looking Bible reader says he came to love this job, along with all the others, including leading a rabble of a test team out of the international wilderness. As a player Adams, the ruminative son of a Jamaican doctor and his Canadian wife, was never a natural at this level. His parents, so the story goes, never trusted cricket and tried to push him towards university and medicine. This he dismisses. \"It's just a good bit of PR that has come out of the Caribbean. I'm happy to go along with it but it's not really the truth. They were perfectly happy that I should do whatever I wanted provided I was earning a living.\" Because of his all-round skills - he also bowls slow left-arm and fields well anywhere, including behind the stumps - he used to be known as Jimmy the Cricket. He first played for Jamaica in 1985 but had to wait six seasons for his maiden first-class century, one of the slowest scored in the Caribbean, and until 1992 for his first test cap. Carl Hooper, who is such an extravagantly gifted but unfulfilled cricketer that he could almost be Adams's alter ego, has played a significant if unwitting part in the other's promotion. It was Hooper's chipped finger which gave Adams his debut in that historic match in Bridgetown in April 1992 when South Africa returned to test cricket, Hooper's bad back which let Adams in for a good series against England in 1994, and, last year, family illness which resulted in Adams replacing him as vice-captain against Australia. In that memorable series the Jamaican was at the other end while Brian Lara played his match-winning innings in Kingston and Bridgetown. Adams took over the captaincy after West Indies had 10 overseas test defeats in a row, failing to win one first-class match on tours of Pakistan, South Africa and New Zealand. In his first test in charge, in Trinidad this year, Zimbabwe needed only 99 to win on the last day. But thanks to Adams the pressure on the batsmen never relented and they were bowled out for 63. Then, at home at Sabina Park, Adams scored his first century for four years to set up a 10-wicket win. And, under intense pressure, his unbeaten 49 carried his side to victory in the deciding test against Pakistan. His performance against England in Birmingham two weeks ago was typical of the cricketer and the man: last out after steering his side from 136 for four to a tally of 397. \"The players know me very well. I captained some of the younger ones on an A tour. They know what I stand for. They know what I'm going to ask for. I'm not going to rant and rave but I do expect standards to be met and, if I have to, I can put a point across strongly.\" Adams, however, is a consensus captain, one who is constantly seeking and measuring the opinions of others. \"I try to involve everyone, with their individual strengths, as much as possible. It's one thing to ask a player to do something. But it's better if we both agree to do something. I have to make decisions but I want everyone to be involved. \"Now, after Birmingham, we have something to build on. I feel we've been rewarded for putting some things in place. It would not have been the end of the world if we had lost that test against Zimbabwe, or the series against Pakistan, because personal experience has told me that you learn your biggest lessons when you fall down. \"But I'm thankful for those results and the one at Edgbaston. And the thing that really pleased me about my 98 there was that there were decent partnerships with Franklyn Rose, Curtly Ambrose, Reon King and Courtney Walsh. That showed me that we had kept the spirit we showed in the last test against Pakistan.\" All we have to do now is convince ourselves that Courtney, Curtly, Sherwin, Brian and Franklyn would all be complete duffers if they had not polished their skills in county cricket and the summer might have consolations after all.",

      "body": "<p>When Francesco Totti scored Italy's first goal against Romania last Saturday, many observers noted that Dino Zoff seemed disinclined to join the celebrations. Why? \"Because it was just one goal,\" Italy's 58-year-old coach replied, \"and that's all it was. I don't like excessive enthusiasm.\" </p> <p>Zoff comes from the Friuli region in the north-east corner of Italy, a long way from la dolce vita . Up there the sky is often as grey as the goalkeeper's jersey in which he not only won a World Cup winner's medal but also kept a clean sheet for 1,143 consecutive minutes of play - still an international record. He is famous, in fact, for giving nothing away. Even so, his legendary dourness sometimes seems as though it must be an elaborate joke. Maybe, underneath it all, he is the Buster Keaton of the game. </p> <p>Or maybe not. The self-same Totti, asked recently about the coach's dislike of talking too much, remarked: \"When he takes you to one side, it's to tell you there's something he's not happy with. So that's why I'm content for him never to say anything at all.\" </p> <p>Yet Zoff, a man who habitually looks as though he carries not just the fate of the national team on his shoulders but the national debt as well, has already achieved something close to a miracle. After a morale-lowering season in which no Serie A club made it as far as the semi-finals of the Champions League, he has helped to restore the self-image of Italian football. Even reaching the last four of Euro 2000 was more than most fans dared to hope for after a build-up featuring a series of undistinguished results. </p> <p>Despite his reputation for taciturnity, he seems to have brought it off principally by rekindling the spirit of the team. \"Inside the dressing room we've made a pact,\" his striker Filippo Inzaghi said the other day. \"And with that state of mind we can go a long way.\" </p> <p>The main secret of Italy's success, according to Alberto Cerruti of La Gazzetta Dello Sport, is the squad's internal harmony. \"And in everybody's opinion, from the players to the masseurs, the person responsible for that is Zoff.\" </p> <p>His first good move, Cerruti said, was to ease the tensions between the players from Juventus and Lazio, who had just finished fighting each other for the championship. It may have helped that he has coached both clubs, won six league titles as a player with the former and will eventually take over as president of the latter. </p> <p>The second was to allow the players to choose their own shirt numbers. And the third was to give them plenty of freedom during the preparations, reducing tactical lectures to a minimum and letting them spend time with their families. </p> <p>Ivan Carminati, their chief physio, devised training routines that are entertaining as well as rigorous. Ciro Ferrara and Angelo di Livio, senior players assigned to the bench, entertain their team-mates with songs and stories. </p> <p>But beyond making the players feel comfortable, Zoff gave them the means with which to dispel self-doubt, to rise above the babble of criticism and to win matches. He has done this by refusing to moan about the last-minute loss through injuries of his most intimidating forward, Christian Vieri, and his No1 goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon, and by adopting tactics that maximise the talents of a group long on professional skills but short on genius. Through rehabilitating certain long-established virtues of the Italian game, he has also given the squad a powerful sense of national identity. </p> <p>So far, his judgment has been subtler than that of his predecessor, Cesare Maldini, who abandoned the 4-4-2 preferred by Arrigo Sacchi and tried to take Italy straight back to the days of catenaccio . Zoff's insistence on efficient defending is reflected in the fact that Italy have conceded only two goals in the tournament so far, but his three-man central module is quite flexible and is flanked by wing-backs who are available to join or initiate attacks, in the modern manner. He listens to his players, too: the selection of Mark Iuliano and the deployment of Paolo Maldini, the captain, wide on the left was apparently suggested by Demetrio Albertini. </p> <p>Lacking a playmaker of the classic type, Zoff has created a midfield unit based on speed and accuracy of interpassing - which also helps promote the sense of ego-less endeavour. He chooses players, assigns them functions that fit their abilities and then demonstrates his faith in them, which must be why Albertini, for instance, has looked twice the player he was in a Milan shirt last season. And Zoff's wild card, Stefano Fiore, a hard-working left-sided midfield man from unfashionable Udinese, has been a particular success, delivering one of the finest goals of the tournament against Belgium. </p> <p>The forwards work as hard as the rest of the team, refusing to drop their heads when a chance goes begging. These players show modesty and humility in their efforts - not least Inzaghi, whose achievements with Juventus have made him a superstar but who remains the most wholehearted of team men. </p> <p>Crucially, Zoff has also handled the peculiarly Italian phenomenon known as la staffetta - the relay - with outstanding wisdom and tact. This feature occurs when two outstanding creative players are deemed unable to play together, either because they are too much alike or too dissimilar. The task defeated two World Cup coaches - Ferruccio Valcareggi, who had to choose between Gianni Rivera and Sandro Mazzola in 1970, and Cesare Maldini, whose dilemma in 1998 involved Roberto Baggio and Alessandro del Piero. </p> <p>This time Del Piero is in competition with Totti, but Zoff has managed to give Totti the starting berth in every game without upsetting either the most highly paid player in the Italian game or the reporters from the Turin papers who favour him. Even when Del Piero comes on only for the last 20 minutes, Zoff makes him look and feel integral to the team. </p> <p>A man with 112 caps hardly needs to bother about PR, and the benefit of Zoff's refusal to play the usual games should not be underestimated. From Turin to Palermo, the Italian in the street did not find himself approaching Euro 2000 buoyed up by exuberant predictions of glory. </p> <p>Zoff's view before the tournament started was straightforward. \"I believe we can do well,\" he said, putting a damper on unrealistic expectations. But why, after a victory as important as the one against Romania, does he continue to sound so downbeat? \"Because the most important game is the one that you have to play next. It may sound banal, but that's how it is.\" And he declined an invitation to raise his earlier assessment of his side's performance, continuing to mark them at seven out of 10. \"There's more to come,\" he promised. </p> <p>So far, seven out of 10 has not produced a style of play that pleases anyone, but public criticism from Sacchi, in particular, may have served to strengthen the squad's collective spirit. </p> <p>Even the players who also worked under Sacchi at Milan were upset by his comments after the quarter-final. \"It wasn't a pretty game,\" Sacchi said, \"but then our team didn't take risks. This isn't a team characterised by adventurousness or courage. It has patience and concentration, and it's well organised in all departments. Up front, its play is exclusively based on counterattacking, on long balls or on individual bursts. It's a kind of pragmatism that breeds cynicism.\" </p> <p>The reaction from within the squad was heated. \"Whenever I see Sacchi on the television I change channels,\" Albertini remarked, and Maldini had a particularly neat riposte. \"I'm happy to be spending my 32nd birthday with the squad,\" he said. \"I can remember four years ago, when the championship was held in England and I was back home in time for the celebrations. That was with Sacchi's Italy.\" </p> <p>Zoff's own response was thoughtful and incisive and said a lot about the attitude of the players Holland will have to overcome tonight. \"People who talk about cynicism aren't watching,\" he said. \"Or at least they're looking at it in partial way. Cynicism implies coldness. Ours is a team with heart, which also happens to have other qualities.\" </p> <p><strong>Match facts</strong></p> <p><strong> Venue</strong> Amsterdam Arena </p> <p><strong> Kick-off</strong> 5pm BST </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> Markus Merk </p> <p>(Germany) </p> <p><strong> Head-to-head</strong> </p> <p>Italy 6 wins </p> <p>Holland 2 wins </p> <p>Draws 5 </p> <p><strong> Television</strong> </p> <p>Live on BBC1 from 4.30pm </p> <p>Highlights on ITV at 11.30pm and BBC1 at 12midnight </p> <p>Replay on BBC1 at 1.05am </p> <p><strong> Radio </strong> Live on Radio 5 Live from 4.30pm </p> <p><strong> Italy</strong> </p> <p>Injuries: Antonio Conte (ankle) </p> <p>One booking from suspension: Demetrio Albertini </p> <p><strong> Holland</strong> </p> <p>Injuries: Arthur Numan (foot), Roy Makaay (ankle) </p> <p>One booking from suspension: Paul Bosvelt</p>",

So far, seven out of 10 has not produced a style of play that pleases anyone, but public criticism from Sacchi, in particular, may have served to strengthen the squad's collective spirit. Even the players who also worked under Sacchi at Milan were upset by his comments after the quarter-final. \"It wasn't a pretty game,\" Sacchi said, \"but then our team didn't take risks. This isn't a team characterised by adventurousness or courage. It has patience and concentration, and it's well organised in all departments. Up front, its play is exclusively based on counterattacking, on long balls or on individual bursts. It's a kind of pragmatism that breeds cynicism.\" The reaction from within the squad was heated. \"Whenever I see Sacchi on the television I change channels,\" Albertini remarked, and Maldini had a particularly neat riposte. \"I'm happy to be spending my 32nd birthday with the squad,\" he said. \"I can remember four years ago, when the championship was held in England and I was back home in time for the celebrations. That was with Sacchi's Italy.\" Zoff's own response was thoughtful and incisive and said a lot about the attitude of the players Holland will have to overcome tonight. \"People who talk about cynicism aren't watching,\" he said. \"Or at least they're looking at it in partial way. Cynicism implies coldness. Ours is a team with heart, which also happens to have other qualities.\" Match facts Venue Amsterdam Arena Kick-off 5pm BST Referee Markus Merk (Germany) Head-to-head Italy 6 wins Holland 2 wins Draws 5 Television Live on BBC1 from 4.30pm Highlights on ITV at 11.30pm and BBC1 at 12midnight Replay on BBC1 at 1.05am Radio Live on Radio 5 Live from 4.30pm Italy Injuries: Antonio Conte (ankle) One booking from suspension: Demetrio Albertini Holland Injuries: Arthur Numan (foot), Roy Makaay (ankle) One booking from suspension: Paul Bosvelt",

The piece starts out looking mimsy (pastel-coloured steps and emotions) but it rapidly grows in complexity with a riveting central duet for Darcey Bussell and Jonathon Cope.

Yes, Robin Guthrie, from the Cocteau Twins. He used to be good. Dammit, he used to be great. Sadly, minus his Liz, this Hugh Grant of indie hasbeendom waddled on with a guitar, played what sounded like the Durutti Column minus any melodies, had some technical problems and grinned. He was perhaps amazed that peo ple will pay good money to see a bad Cocteaus soundcheck. </p> <p>David Pajo (usually of Papa M) has obviously decided that what the world really needs are the sounds of a tractor tangling with a pylon, and demonstrated them with a guitar for at least 20 minutes. Still, he has a sense of humour; he ended with a bizarre, hilarious Dylanesque song (yes, song) about the minority-interest indie scene. But sadly Pissing in the Wind was lost on a crowd too busy discussing Nick Drake's relationship with John Martyn and record label \"imprints\". </p> <p>Icelanders Sigur Ros were like Aled Jones singing with a hopeless Joy Division tribute band covering 40s death- tribute marches. They have the stage presence of four gnats. Heads bowed (rightly so!), black-clad and playing guitars with a violin bow, they were staggeringly precious, ridiculously cacophonous and about as \"ambient\" as a bassoon up an angry rhinoceros's backside. </p> <p>In fact, all of this stuff has somehow taken Brian Eno's conception of ambient - innocuously beautiful music - as a licence for anally retentive, insular, naval-gazing pretentiousness of the most unbearable order. By the time I had heard the sub-Tangerine Dream/Fast Show's \"Jazz Club\" dronings of Labradford, I'd had enough. Festival of Drifting? They should bury it in snow. </p> <p> \u0095 At the Arts Centre, Colchester, tonight. Box office: 01206 500 900.</p>",

Sadly, minus his Liz, this Hugh Grant of indie hasbeendom waddled on with a guitar, played what sounded like the Durutti Column minus any melodies, had some technical problems and grinned. He was perhaps amazed that peo ple will pay good money to see a bad Cocteaus soundcheck. David Pajo (usually of Papa M) has obviously decided that what the world really needs are the sounds of a tractor tangling with a pylon, and demonstrated them with a guitar for at least 20 minutes. Still, he has a sense of humour; he ended with a bizarre, hilarious Dylanesque song (yes, song) about the minority-interest indie scene. But sadly Pissing in the Wind was lost on a crowd too busy discussing Nick Drake's relationship with John Martyn and record label \"imprints\". Icelanders Sigur Ros were like Aled Jones singing with a hopeless Joy Division tribute band covering 40s death- tribute marches. They have the stage presence of four gnats. Heads bowed (rightly so!), black-clad and playing guitars with a violin bow, they were staggeringly precious, ridiculously cacophonous and about as \"ambient\" as a bassoon up an angry rhinoceros's backside. In fact, all of this stuff has somehow taken Brian Eno's conception of ambient - innocuously beautiful music - as a licence for anally retentive, insular, naval-gazing pretentiousness of the most unbearable order. By the time I had heard the sub-Tangerine Dream/Fast Show's \"Jazz Club\" dronings of Labradford, I'd had enough. Festival of Drifting? They should bury it in snow. \u0095 At the Arts Centre, Colchester, tonight. Box office: 01206 500 900.",

      "bodyText": "The problem Last year I was given a final written warning after one of my staff had stolen some money and I had not noticed. In the meantime I had already moved to a lower-paid, part-time position, due to ill health. My problem is now that I am terrified I will get the sack as even a trivial misdemeanor will mean dismissal. I've had a few weeks off sick this year and I am also frightened that this will go against me. And I'm too frightened to ask advice from personnel as they disciplined me in the first place. How can I regain my confidence and self-esteem? The solution Relationships between employer and employee are often irrevocably damaged by the time a final written warning is delivered. You will probably already have had at least one verbal warning as well as another written warning. A final written warning often leads to the employee leaving, either voluntarily or not. That is not to say that an employee so disciplined cannot claw their way back into the grace and favour of their boss. But, a bad reputation is notoriously hard to turn around and to do so will require a great deal of effort, self-analysis and honesty on your part. The first thing to do is to examine what is going wrong. Were these warnings deserved? Is the quality of your work suffering because of your health? Can things improve? If you feel that you can turn over a new leaf and deserve a chance to prove yourself again, I suggest you sit down with your boss and explain why things have gone so wrong.

      "byline": "Roy Collins  in Brussels",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Youri Djorkaeff was a wide-eyed 16-year-old on the terraces of Marseille's Stade Velodrome when France last played Portugal in a European Championship semi-final in 1984. And when he taps into the emotions of that memorable evening, the words still tumble out in the vocabulary of an impressionable teenager. \"It was a fantastic experience,\" he says, \"one of the greatest nights of my life.\" </p> <p>Tonight, in the King Baudouin stadium, he and his team-mates intend to repeat that victory, though they will be hoping for a less dramatic finish than 16 years ago. Then, the heavily fancied French rescued themselves with a Spanish-style comeback, turning a 1-2 deficit into a 3-2 triumph with a 118th-minute winner from Michel Platini when the referee was already pondering which end the penalties should be taken from. </p> <p>France went on to beat Spain 2-0 in the final and, though Djorkaeff talks of repeating that success, victory in Euro 2000 would represent not so much emulation as obliteration of the side always hailed as the greatest in France's history. The 1998 World Cup win was undoubtedly a greater achievement but French fans are no different from any others in refusing to acknowledge greatness until it is in encased in mothballs. </p> <p>This French team still carry scars from the back-stabbing over their style of play in France 98, when they were constantly compared unfavourably with the holy midfield trinity of Platini, Alain Giresse and Jean Tigana in 1984. So if they see off the talented Portuguese tonight and then lift the trophy on Sunday they will have earned the right to insist that critics think twice before launching an attack. </p> <p>Djorkaeff also remembers the inspiring effect the 1984 win had on the French nation. \"That match meant so much to French football,\" he says, aware that tonight's means no less to expectant supporters who have become so used to victory that they are unlikely, like fans of old, to respond to underachievement with a Gallic shrug. </p> <p>Zinedine Zidane believes the team have ripened since 1998, and their performance against Spain in Sunday's semi-final certainly endorsed his words. Part of the secret might be the eclectic experience garnered by the players. Djorkaeff, who capped an outstanding display with the winner, plays in Germany with Kaiserslautern; Zidane, Laurent Blanc and Lilian Thuram play in Italy; Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Deschamps in the Premiership; and Nicolas Anelka in Spain, with Premiership previous.

      "bodyText": "Youri Djorkaeff was a wide-eyed 16-year-old on the terraces of Marseille's Stade Velodrome when France last played Portugal in a European Championship semi-final in 1984. And when he taps into the emotions of that memorable evening, the words still tumble out in the vocabulary of an impressionable teenager. \"It was a fantastic experience,\" he says, \"one of the greatest nights of my life.\" Tonight, in the King Baudouin stadium, he and his team-mates intend to repeat that victory, though they will be hoping for a less dramatic finish than 16 years ago. Then, the heavily fancied French rescued themselves with a Spanish-style comeback, turning a 1-2 deficit into a 3-2 triumph with a 118th-minute winner from Michel Platini when the referee was already pondering which end the penalties should be taken from. France went on to beat Spain 2-0 in the final and, though Djorkaeff talks of repeating that success, victory in Euro 2000 would represent not so much emulation as obliteration of the side always hailed as the greatest in France's history. The 1998 World Cup win was undoubtedly a greater achievement but French fans are no different from any others in refusing to acknowledge greatness until it is in encased in mothballs. This French team still carry scars from the back-stabbing over their style of play in France 98, when they were constantly compared unfavourably with the holy midfield trinity of Platini, Alain Giresse and Jean Tigana in 1984. So if they see off the talented Portuguese tonight and then lift the trophy on Sunday they will have earned the right to insist that critics think twice before launching an attack. Djorkaeff also remembers the inspiring effect the 1984 win had on the French nation. \"That match meant so much to French football,\" he says, aware that tonight's means no less to expectant supporters who have become so used to victory that they are unlikely, like fans of old, to respond to underachievement with a Gallic shrug. Zinedine Zidane believes the team have ripened since 1998, and their performance against Spain in Sunday's semi-final certainly endorsed his words. Part of the secret might be the eclectic experience garnered by the players. Djorkaeff, who capped an outstanding display with the winner, plays in Germany with Kaiserslautern; Zidane, Laurent Blanc and Lilian Thuram play in Italy; Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and Deschamps in the Premiership; and Nicolas Anelka in Spain, with Premiership previous. Christophe Dugarry is back in the French league after spells in Italy and Spain. Djorkaeff says: \"I knew I was going to score that goal against Spain the moment I brought the ball under control. I could just feel it. It is the kind of feeling that only comes from having a lot of confidence in the squad.\" It is also a feeling that only comes when a player is at the peak of his fitness and form, and France's coach Roger Lemerre will surely retain Djorkaeff in the midfield tonight, even though Emmanuel Petit is fit again. Portugal can expect to win the support of neutrals because of the mesmeric performances of such players as Luis Figo and Rui Costa which have helped to make them most people's favourite second team. Yet despite the impression that the French are too arrogant to warrant popularity, the sheer majesty of their football would win them plenty of votes in a beauty contest. Close as Spain took them in the quarter-final, there was a conviction on and off the pitch that whereas the Spaniards at times seemed to be running close to empty, France always had some juice sloshing away in the reserve tank. That is one of the privileges of World Cup winners, insists Djorkaeff, saying: \"We are champions and we feel like champions. And champions, of course, always feel strong and have that little bit more to offer when it is necessary.\" They may need to prove that again tonight.

They immediately pass back to Baia and he hoofs the ball upfield.<br> <strong>2</strong> A very cautious start for Portugal as they again pass back to Baia. France nearly caught out when a back-pass to Barthez almost sells him short.<br> <strong>3</strong> Still nothing much to speak of as both teams seek to find their feet. <br> <strong>4</strong> Portugal free-kick wide on the right just fails to release Rui Costa on a run.<br> <strong>5</strong> Thuram sets off down the right for France, tries a one-two with Anelka; France win a free-kick - Petit takes from wide on the right, 40 yards out, but Vieira is penalised for wrestling with Vidigal in the area.<br> <strong>7</strong> Henry gets up on the left and crosses from the byline but it is easy for Baia.<br> <strong>8</strong> Portugal free-kick after Gomes is brought down by Vieira near the left touchline. Comes to nothing. Rare poor control by Zidane 30 yards out almost allows Rui Costa to get away into space but Baia charges out to cover.<br> <strong>11</strong> Still no real rhythm to the game as France win a free-kick 25 yards out, square-on to goal. Zidane takes and tries to lift the ball over to top to the advancing Blanc near the right-hand upright but it runs out of play. <br> <strong>13</strong> Zidane is finding life difficult up against Xavier who has most definitely got his tackling head on tonight.<br> <strong>15</strong> Deschamps finds Anelka on the right but the ball is cleared for a throw.<br> <strong>16</strong> Things have suddenly picked up as Henry is tackled on the left byline by the omni-present Xavier. France free-kick, but it goes for a France throw on the right. Cleared by Portugal. <br> <strong>18</strong> Thuram and Zidane exchange passes to the right of the area, but Portugal hold firm and neither can find space in which to pass. Then Vieira does just that and races away on the right, crosses for Petit on the far side of the area but he cannot get in a shot.<br> <strong>19 GOAL! Portugal 1 - 0 France</strong> From nothing this one. Conceicao picks up possession to the right of the France area from a Xavier pass, does well to keep hold of the ball as he cuts inside and then finds Gomes 20 yards out. Gomes strikes first time with his left foot to leave Barthez stranded as the ball flies to his right for the opener.<br> <strong>23 Booking</strong> Vieira for hacking down Figo.<br> <strong>25</strong> France pick up the pace and Baia is forced to gather a cross from the right to his near post.<br> <strong>26</strong> France free-kick 35 yards out. Petit takes it quickly, over the top, but Baia gets there first.<br> <strong>27</strong> Gomes races away on the right for Portugal and finds Figo ahead of him, but his cross from the byline is easy for Barthez.<br> <strong>29</strong> Anelka picks up possession to the left of the France area, runs across the face of goal and shoots from the right but Baia claims. Portugal break, Figo beats Blanc 25 yards out but his right-foot shot from the edge of the area is blocked by Desailly; Barthez claims the wildly looping delfection.<br> <strong>33</strong> France come alive as Zidane plays superb one-touch football with Henry to the right of the Portugal area. The ball goes wide to Thuram, then back in for Henry to snatch at his shot from distance.<br> <strong>36</strong> Dimas and Rui Costa play a lovely one-two on the right which sees Rui Costa away to the byline, but his cross comes to nothing.<br> <strong>37</strong> Portugal finding most of the space at the moment, particularly down the right as Rui Costa is brought down near the touchline - no foul.<br> <strong>38</strong> France push up - Henry races to the byline and dives right on the edge of the area; nothing given.<br> <strong>40 Booking</strong> Desailly for a tackle on Rui Costa 30 yards out. Conceicao blasts the free-kick straight at the wall.<br> <strong>42</strong> France starting to look frustrated as more and more of their passes are failing to reacsh the target.<br> <strong>43</strong> Conceicao gets away on the right and launches the ball into space for Rui Costa to chase but Barthez commits himself early and clears.<br> <strong>44</strong> Henry agains finds space on the right of the area and pulls the ball back for Vieira to shot over the bar.<br> <strong>45</strong> The half draws to a close with France on the attack. Zidane shimmies around the edge of the area and unleashes a shot into the crowd. Portugal win a free-kick on the touchline, to the right of the area, after Desailly barges Rui Costa of the ball and into the linesman. Figo takes and France clear. Half-time. Not the exhibition match that many had hoped for and probably not the scoreline that many would have predicted either, but Portugal deserve their lead nonetheless.</p> <p><strong>46</strong> France kick-off the second half. Anelka fails to get in an early cross from the left byline. <br> <strong>47</strong> Henry fails to get around Costa on the edge of the area before Vieira is pulled up for a foul.<br> <strong>50</strong> France get up numbers but Portugal again hold firm and clear.<br> <strong>51 GOAL! Portugal 1 - 1 France</strong> France free-kick square to Petit; he plays it in but Portugal clear. France play it back in again straight away and find Anelka on the right byline. He pulls it back for Henry to shoot to the far post for the equaliser.<br> <strong>54</strong> The pace of the game now bears no comparison to the first half.<br> <strong>55</strong> Anelka is brought down right on the edge of the penalty area by Costa, and he earns a <strong>booking</strong>...<br> <strong>56</strong>... Petit takes the free-kick but Dimas blocks well. Portugal break with Figo down the left but his cross into the area is headed away for a corner by Lizarazu. France clear. <br> <strong>58</strong> Rui Costa sprays the ball wide to Conceicao on the right but France cover well.<br> <strong>59</strong> France corner from the right. Petit takes to the far post, but Desailly can only get his shoulder to the ball and direct it wide.<br> <strong>61</strong> Bento on for Vidigal.<br> <strong>62</strong> Good work by Portugal around the France area allows Rui Costa to get in a shot. <strong>Booking</strong> Dimas for a challenge on Henry.<br> <strong>64</strong> Portugal win a corner after more good work on the right by Costinha. Comes to nothing.<br> <strong>65</strong> Vieira tries to break through the middle but is obstructed.<br> <strong>67</strong> Henry goes down after a challenge from Xavier, but after a quick rest he his back on his feet.<br> <strong>68</strong> Zidane rides three challenges in midfield with some fancy footwork but is undone by the fourth and loses possession when he could have played back for safety. <br> <strong>70</strong> A great pass by Zidane on the edge of the centre circle finds Anelka in space to the left of the area, but his delayed shot is blocked.<br> <strong>71</strong> More great work by Zidane he controls the ball with chest and foot before finding Anelka in the area, but Anelka loses his footing and the ball goes for a free-kick.<br> <strong>72 Substitution</strong> Wiltord on for Anelka.<br> <strong>74</strong> Vieira plays in Wiltord on the right and France win a corner. Desailly again the target man and again he fails to get to the ball.<br> <strong>76</strong> France corner on the right. Petit takes but Baia punches clear.<br> <strong>77</strong> Lizarazu plays the ball in; it comes out for Petit to shoot from the edge of the area - Baia forces the ball wide. Unlucky for France.<br> <strong>78 Substitution</strong> Joao Pinto on.<br> <strong>82</strong> Frantic stuff now as both teams seek to avoid extra time and the golden goal scenario.<br> <strong>83</strong> Petit just fails to find Henry running into the area.<br> <strong>85</strong> Portugal continue to push up but have had few chances on goal in this half. France are packing the penalty area whenever Portugal cross the half-way line.<br> <strong>86</strong> Figo tries to find Conceicao on the right but Barthez beats him to it at the corner flag. <br> <strong>87</strong> Gomes' header from a looping centre is saved by Barthez. <strong>Substitution</strong> Pires on for Petit.<br> <strong>88</strong> Thuram pulls the ball back from the byline but there is no one there to meet it and Portugal clear. France corner.<br> <strong>89</strong> Zidane takes but it comes to nothing.<br> <strong>90</strong> Desperate times now. Can Portugal pull a late goal out of the dying minutes of this match? Portugal free-kick. Figo takes from 40 yards out and finds Xavier who heads well for Barthez to make a great save. Terrific chance for Portugal. Two minutes extra to play. Henry in the six-yard box pulls the ball back, but again there is no one there for France as Portugal pack out the area. Full-time.

Half-time. 16 Portugal kick-off the second period with France looking the more likely to score. 17 Booking Joao Pinto. Zidane tries a shot from distance - no chance as the ball rolls lamely wide. 18 Gomes tries to loop the bll over the top to Figo but he is caught offside. Close, but good, call. 19 France come close but Wiltord in the area is thwarted by the offside flag. 20 Joao Pinto shoots from just inside the area and beats Barthez but the ball goes a foot wide of the far post. 23 France break with Zidane; he takes the ball 30 yards before being stopped by Rui Jorge. 24 Penalty! Xavier is deemed to have saved with his hand from Wiltord at the near post when Baia became stranded after a probing run by Trezeguet. Long delay as the referee consults again with the linesman... 27... Zidane takes and scores the winner as the Portugese players surround the referee. Rui Jorge looks as though he is about to head-butt the ref. But it is all over to boos from the crowd. Portugal 1 - 2 France.",

      "body": "<p>When Lord Harris, with WG Grace at his side, led his England team on to the Lord's outfield against Australia on July 21 1884, the debutant Test venue was a long way from being the principal cricket arena in the land. The rival establishment across the Thames at Kennington Oval - thanks to high-class organisation and a sharper business acumen - had until earlier that season staged every home Test match, and until the previous year every home football international as well. </p> <p>By the start of the 20th century, however, the influence, money and patrician style of Marylebone Cricket Club had established Lord's as the most charismatic Test venue in the world. And so it remains on the eve of its 100th Test match: a place where every overseas cricketer dreams of beating England, and where every schoolboy batsman imagines himself acknowledging the applause for his maiden Test century (scored ideally on his 17th birthday, before lunch, against Australia). </p> <p>Yet the history and reputation of Lord's also offers a mass of contradictions. This tranquil domain of law-abiding MCC members provided, for instance, the unwholesome sight in 1980 of those members, fuelled by drink and frustration at rain delays, roughing up umpires for sticking rigidly to the game's regulations. Lord's can bring a lump to the throat as it rings down the curtain on Dickie Bird's career as master of ceremonies or John Arlott's as master of the microphone, yet it can also rack us with embarrassment at the innate cruelty of cricket, as it did in 1960 when South Africa's Geoff Griffin was no-balled out of the match, and out of Test cricket for ever, for his suspect arm action. It is the very temple of middle-class rectitude, with near-Victorian views on sartorial propriety, yet it was also the stage for the first Test-match streaker in 1975 (fined 20 quid, don't do it again). </p> <p>It was at Lord's that Ian Botham became the first cricketer to score a century and take eight wickets in an innings in the same Test, and at Lord's that the maestro's reign as England's captain - a reign without a single win - ended ignominiously with a duck in each innings. It is a ground where England have, over the years, performed pretty well (35 Tests won against 24 lost), yet a ground where their decline in the past two decades has been highlighted most emphatically: half of those defeats have come since 1980, but only seven of the victories. </p> <p>The anomalies do not end there. The Lord's Test match, by tradition, is synonymous with high summer - after Royal Ascot, before the climactic week of Wimbledon - with the sun blazing down to torture the members in their mandatory collars-and-ties. Yet of the 99 Lord's Tests so far, the weather has severely curtailed play, or crucially affected the result, in almost exactly a third. </p> <p>The biggest anomaly of all is Australia. England won that first Lord's encounter in 1884 emphatically, by an innings; they did the same two years later, and won twice again before the century closed. But since then, through 22 Ashes series played in England (as well as the one-off Centenary Test in 1980) Australia have lost only once, and even then Bill Woodfull's team of 1934 went on to regain the Ashes they had relinquished in the Bodyline series. </p> <p>Lord's has bestowed spectacular rewards on a few favourites. Bob Massie, for example, was deemed good enough to play for Australia only six times, and ended his Test career with only 31 wickets, yet more than half of those were taken on his debut, when he swung England to defeat at Lord's in 1972. His 16-137, eight wickets in each innings, has never been surpassed at headquarters. </p> <p>England players have, of course, had more opportunity for success (and failure) and a few have gloried in its special atmosphere. Nobody who was there has ever forgotten the blazing hot day in 1938 when Walter Hammond, regrouping an innings in tatters at 31 for three, scored 70 imperious runs off Australia's finest in each of the three sessions (70 not out at lunch, 140 not out at tea, 210 not out at the close) to end the day with his side safe and in command at 409 for five. Next morning he took his score to 240 and was cheered to the echo until his back had disappeared into the shadows of the Long Room. </p> <p>It was not, even then, the highest Test innings played at Lord's (Bradman, of course, held that one) and it did not win the match, but it had been a display of courage, power and technique of exceptional resonance. The guv'nor of Lord's, however, was Graham Gooch. He played 21 Tests there between 1975 and 1994 and scored more than 2,000 runs, a good 750 more than any other batsman (though Alec Stewart, who needs two runs in tomorrow's Test match to be second on the list, is still going strong). Gooch scored six Test centuries at Lord's, too, including his 333 against India in 1990, the highest innings ever played there. </p> <p><strong> Courageous Cowdrey</strong><br> It is another measure of the fickle nature of Lord's that whereas two more of Gooch's distinguished contemporaries, Geoff Boycott and David Gower, also passed the 1,000-run mark at Lord's, the other high achiever of the era, Mike Atherton, averages only 32 and has never scored a Test century there - though he did run himself out for 99 against Australia in 1993. </p> <p>Even stranger has been the reluctance of Lord's to get us really excited on the last day. In 99 Tests it has produced only one decisive result tighter than a win by four wickets (Australia beating England in 1985) or by 61 runs (ditto, 97 years earlier). The exception was Pakistan's two-wicket victory engineered by Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis to clinch the most gripping of contests in 1992, which could legitimately stand as the finest Lord's Test of all were it not for the West Indies match of 1963 - Frank Worrell, Wes Hall and a one-armed Colin Cowdrey. </p> <p>As the last over began of a game whose fortunes had swung back and forth through sunshine and shower-breaks for all five days, England needed eight runs to win with two wickets left. One of those wickets, though, was that of Cowdrey, whose left arm had been broken by a ball from Hall the night before but who was prepared, if it came to the crunch, to face the bowling with one hand holding the bat in a left-hander's stance. Hall, who had bowled unchanged, and very fast, for the past 3 hours, conceded singles off his second and third balls; Derek Shackleton was run out trying to steal a bye off the fourth; and in came Cowdrey, left arm in a sling and mercifully at the non-striker's end. With two balls remaining four results were possible: an England win, a West Indies win, a tie and a draw. David Allen stoutly blocked them both to ensure the draw - and fled before an invasion of spectators delirious with equal measures of excitement, admiration and relief. </p> <p>There have been 51 Tests at Lord's since that drama. It remains the greatest of Test venues - and it is high time the old lady, 100 Tests old this week, pulled another spine-tingler out of the hat just to prove it. </p> <p> There have been 99 Test matches played at Lord's to date, including one between Australia and South Africa during the triangular series of 1912...</p>",

      "body": "<p>The International Cricket Council announced that it was getting tough on crime by appointing Sir Paul Condon to take charge of match-rigging inquiries. This was a rather New Labour announcement, since it is at least the seventh time we have been told that the ICC is getting serious about corruption, and there is always less to each announcement than meets the eye. In this case, it may take a moment for the unwary to realise that Condon's power is decidedly limited. </p> <p>The only Blairite aspects missing are that (a) so far no one yet appears to have called Condon \"the match-rigging czar\", and (b) no one has said that, as well as being tough on crime, the ICC plans to get tough on the causes of crime. This is partly because it ain't getting tough on these at all. </p> <p>Consider the life of Brian Statham. The coincidence of his sad death this month and the Cronje hearings prompted many comparisons between the disgraced captain and the dead hero (\"a real cricketer!\"). However, Statham - without having frittered his money on champagne or cocaine - spent most of his later life in financial stress. </p> <p>In 1957, around the height of his career, the fee for English professionals playing in home Tests leapt from \u00a375 to \u00a3100 a match. At the time the average working man was getting close to \u00a31,000 a year, without having to worry much about losing it all in the event of a groin strain. </p> <p>Most of Statham's best-known contemporaries converted their celebrity into some kind of pension plan: in the City, PR, the media, after-dinner speaking, even (Fred Trueman) a bit of cabaret. Statham - great bowler; nice, shy man - was very un-that. </p> <p>Since then the money has shot up, but nowhere near as much as the expectations. In 1957, golfers, tennis stars and footballers (maximum wage: \u00a320 a week) earned damn all too. Now cricketers have been left miles behind. Sure, there are fortunes available for Lara, Warne and Tendulkar, as there would be for an English equivalent if one ever appeared. But they get rich by ancillary deals. </p> <p>Chris Adams, a failure at top level, is said to get \u00a370,000 a year at Sussex, but even that's a pittance by sporting standards, and most get in a year what a Premiership player earns in a week. County players' security hinges on the mad, degrading caprice of the benefit system and whether they can hustle. </p> <p>Remember too that the UK is about the richest of the 10 Test-playing countries. The Aussie dollar has been weak for years, let alone the rand, the rupee or the Bangladeshi taka. The average pro golfer is richer than everyone else he meets. Yet the money sloshing round the edge of a cricket field is far greater than anything available in the middle. The new \u00a3360m (with power to add) world television deal is one sign of that. </p> <p>Another sign is the number of wealthy people in the pavilion and corporate boxes as the corks pop at Lord's tomorrow. And those are the punters, never mind the bookmakers. Yet when the Pakistani umpire Javed Akhtar disgraced himself in the Headingley Test of 1998 (incompetence being the best interpretation, corruption the worst) he was paid 158 piddling quid, 1/18th the fee of his English partner. </p> <p>Fringe international players are paid better, but not always by much. The wonder is not that people in cricket are bent, but that some still appear to be straight. To a struggling pro, Statham may seem a more alarming example than Cronje. </p> <p>Teams get \u00a310,000 for winning a one-day international this summer, \u00a320,000 for a Test, but what's that split 14 or 15 ways compared with what might be on offer from an Indian bookmaker?

      "bodyText": "The International Cricket Council announced that it was getting tough on crime by appointing Sir Paul Condon to take charge of match-rigging inquiries. This was a rather New Labour announcement, since it is at least the seventh time we have been told that the ICC is getting serious about corruption, and there is always less to each announcement than meets the eye. In this case, it may take a moment for the unwary to realise that Condon's power is decidedly limited. The only Blairite aspects missing are that (a) so far no one yet appears to have called Condon \"the match-rigging czar\", and (b) no one has said that, as well as being tough on crime, the ICC plans to get tough on the causes of crime. This is partly because it ain't getting tough on these at all. Consider the life of Brian Statham. The coincidence of his sad death this month and the Cronje hearings prompted many comparisons between the disgraced captain and the dead hero (\"a real cricketer!\"). However, Statham - without having frittered his money on champagne or cocaine - spent most of his later life in financial stress. In 1957, around the height of his career, the fee for English professionals playing in home Tests leapt from \u00a375 to \u00a3100 a match. At the time the average working man was getting close to \u00a31,000 a year, without having to worry much about losing it all in the event of a groin strain. Most of Statham's best-known contemporaries converted their celebrity into some kind of pension plan: in the City, PR, the media, after-dinner speaking, even (Fred Trueman) a bit of cabaret. Statham - great bowler; nice, shy man - was very un-that. Since then the money has shot up, but nowhere near as much as the expectations. In 1957, golfers, tennis stars and footballers (maximum wage: \u00a320 a week) earned damn all too. Now cricketers have been left miles behind. Sure, there are fortunes available for Lara, Warne and Tendulkar, as there would be for an English equivalent if one ever appeared. But they get rich by ancillary deals. Chris Adams, a failure at top level, is said to get \u00a370,000 a year at Sussex, but even that's a pittance by sporting standards, and most get in a year what a Premiership player earns in a week. County players' security hinges on the mad, degrading caprice of the benefit system and whether they can hustle. Remember too that the UK is about the richest of the 10 Test-playing countries. The Aussie dollar has been weak for years, let alone the rand, the rupee or the Bangladeshi taka. The average pro golfer is richer than everyone else he meets. Yet the money sloshing round the edge of a cricket field is far greater than anything available in the middle. The new \u00a3360m (with power to add) world television deal is one sign of that. Another sign is the number of wealthy people in the pavilion and corporate boxes as the corks pop at Lord's tomorrow. And those are the punters, never mind the bookmakers. Yet when the Pakistani umpire Javed Akhtar disgraced himself in the Headingley Test of 1998 (incompetence being the best interpretation, corruption the worst) he was paid 158 piddling quid, 1/18th the fee of his English partner. Fringe international players are paid better, but not always by much. The wonder is not that people in cricket are bent, but that some still appear to be straight. To a struggling pro, Statham may seem a more alarming example than Cronje. Teams get \u00a310,000 for winning a one-day international this summer, \u00a320,000 for a Test, but what's that split 14 or 15 ways compared with what might be on offer from an Indian bookmaker? And all the evidence of the past few years is that the system of endless, pointless, contextless one-day games staged as wallpaper for TV and bookmakers - a system in which a well-rigged game or a contrived incident will never be noticed - is to the corruption epidemic what the San Francisco bath-houses were to Aids. \"The amount of one-day cricket has no bearing on allegations of corruption,\" said David Richards of the ICC on Monday, bizarrely.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>JR:</strong> How do you think about music when you're writing the script? I know when you wrote Beau Travail, you were listening to the Benjamin Britten opera. So it's really a big part of the whole process for you?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Yes. For instance, N\u00e9nette et Boni was completely nourished at the very beginning when we were writing the script by a song by the Tindersticks called 'My sister' In a weird way it was there all the time, but I was lucky enough to be able to ask them to be there, y'know. It's true that music is the origin, it opens free space and I trust that. Music gives an opportunity, even if a scene is soundless or there is dialogue with no music, it could be open and created by music. Like a vision, you know, colours. I don't know, music in film for me is not another part of a soundtrack, it is something that also helps to approach a character, to foresee the type of image, you see what I mean, it's like a part of the process.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Faces, again. You use the same actors again and again, so we see the same faces, we see people getting older, you've worked several times with Alex Descas. Gr\u00e9goire Colin, who's in this film, we've seen him age from quite a young boy in the short to the legionnaire in this film. Why do you like using the same people? Is it security, to have a family around you? Or is it so that the viewers can see something different with the same people?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> No, I think that it's because I am a very slow person. I always feel that when a film is finished it's not enough. It's important to immediately start another one with the same people. A film takes a lot of time, and yet not enough to share with the people you're making the movie with, I think. I didn't consciously create a family. I think it's interesting to always work with the same person because you learn together, you experience things together. I like that very much. Also I think it's a good way to be protected from horrible so-called casting, y'know. I think it's so terrifying that you write a script and now you have to cast - so to prevent that terrible moment, I. . .</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Has any producer ever said to you 'Well for this film you have to have a star'?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Yes, for all the films! But all the people I work with are stars to me. They are no better than the people I work with, I think. Denis Lavant, Michel [Subor], I mean to me, they are stars. When we were doing Beau Travail, Denis knows and Michel knows how much I wanted to work with them. I told my producer that without Denis I was not going to make the film.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Let's get on to Beau Travail. This film has a very strange origin, in that it's a film about the desert based on the sea story based on Herman Melville's Billy Budd. How did the story turn into the film?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> As I told you, I was proposed by Art\u00e9 and I thought maybe, as I was myself so ignorant about the Legion, the best way was to create a film about being a foreigner. But the Foreign Legion is like a myth, it's been in movies many times and we had a very, very low budget. So I kind of knew that the group would be a few men and not an army and I realised that again, literature, my knowledge of men together, of discipline, with women separate, was the way Melville described a sailor's life. I keep remembering that from my teens and I thought that maybe it would help me to approach the story about the Legion. Little by little, I realised that in Billy Budd, I didn't like [the character] Billy Budd, I was most interested in Galoup, who was the bad guy and he was going to be the main character. I was less interested in a character that was innocence and purity, to me I understand Claggart better. I don't think he's evil, I think he's really human, opposed to Billy Budd who was the symbol of purity. That's how we started. Little by little, as I worked with Denis Lavant, we find out that what was solid for us was mostly Herman Melville's poetry. More than Billy Budd. That's how we started working with Denis, was with a poem.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Some critics also invoked Jean Genet because like Genet's stories it's a story about men being very physical in a very enclosed male environment. Was that the idea - do you see it as a homoerotic story?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Yes of course. I mean, Billy Budd is almost an icon and I knew of course, I mean I've seen Querelle, I've read Querelle, which is Jean Genet's interpretation of Billy Budd - so of course I knew that. But I think I like Querelle very much, but I think it's difficult to work under the shadow of Billy Budd and Querelle. It was good to choose a free path and knowing that we were in relation to a landscape that would express something to the group of men, maybe a jail after all. Also Galoup's room at the end is like a cell. And the nightclubs with the girls would be like the other side of the world so I think it was better to go free.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> OK. And now we welcome on stage the film's stars Denis Lavant and Michel Subor. Michel, first of all, people will recognise you from Godard's Le Petit Soldat - and you have the same name as the character in that film [Bruno Forestier] - is this the same character 40 years on?</p> <p>MS: Could be (laughs). It could be, yes, definitely. It was the same man who acted, so, it is the same character I guess. </p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Claire, what is the connection between the two Bruno Forestiers?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Well, I was looking for a commandant and I knew it had to be someone who has a past. A guy who stays so long in the Legion would have a heavy past and in France would have some connection with the Algerian war. I think Le Petit Soldat is the film that I like - more than like - I think it's a part of my life of film-making. Le Petit Soldat is very important. Michel Subor is part of that and I always wanted to work with him. Sometimes I was too shy to ask, but I always wanted this. I saw this was the right moment to ask him to be in it and therefore I wanted him to be called Bruno Forestier, to have the bracelet and to be the same guy. Because at the end of Le Petit Soldat he shoots the guy from the Algerian Secret Service and he has escaped from the French army so he has no place to go . . . </p> <p><strong>MS:</strong> Yes, you quit something to get into something else - that's the reason of the Foreign Legion - you enter a new family, a new life - and he's entering this. </p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Working with Denis, could you see Galoup already in the character we know from the Leos Carax films?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Well, as I said before, I would not have been able to make the movie without Denis, and Denis doesn't speak English, so he doesn't understand a word of what I am saying [laughter]. He was part of the project from the first day. Also because I knew Denis from Leos Carax movies, and also from the theatre, he works a lot in the theatre. The project was linked to him right from the beginning.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> It's a very physical role, Galoup. How did you do the manoeuvres and the dance? Did you practice, you were trained?</p> <p><strong>DL:</strong> Yes, we were trained. Physically, I was already in okay physical condition. You have to be somewhat fit when you work in the theatre - a little bit! Further to this, however, we also worked for a month with a choreographer, Bernardo Montet who made us work like animals to learn the ways of the Legion - not only the drill and the endurance, but also the more difficult - the instinctive choreography. In fact, as I was involved in the theatre, I could not participate fully in rehearsals, if the truth be told. Yet, it was when I actually arrived there, at Djibouti, I had to be 100% in perfect shape in order to play a character who is a legionnaire, who has been there for fifteen years. To be credible I had to become a part of the country, almost. It is this that I disappeared into and it was a pure pleasure throughout the film to completely immerse myself in the culture of Djibouti and in the volcanic rhythms of the film. . . I could go on for hours (laughs). I would like to add something that interests me very much, that Claire mentioned earlier, while we were speaking on the train, about working from another script to rehearse something that is entirely different. For me, I practise juggling to help with the more tedious training - to help keep my head free. </p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Denis took his juggling material with him to Djibouti to practise, because Claire has the practice of rehearsing not with the scripts that they're actually going to film but with other texts. So he was working on other texts as well, which was his juggling. Let's have some questions because we have time.</p> <p><strong>Q1:</strong> Did you get the scene [in Beau Travail] where they're circling each other from Once upon a Time in the West?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> I thought of that when we did the editing. But the thing is, it was a real exercise that you learn doing martial arts - to walk in a circle and always look at the enemy's eyes. So we trained that with Bernardo Montet. After training on that exercise we decided to keep it in the movie. There was a scene in the script where they were facing each other, looking at each other with a fierce look and we so turned it into that, you know. When we were in the editing room I thought 'That's like a Sergio Leone movie'. I was amazed.</p> <p><strong>Q2:</strong> Where is the Lithuanian driving to at the end of J'ai pas Sommeil?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> I wanted her to drive back to Vilnius with the money. But I wanted to go and film her driving to Vilnius. But we couldn't make that so we were just able to have her drive off from Paris but that was the main idea, to have her drive back home.</p> <p><strong>Q3:</strong> What does dancing mean to you?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> I don't know. Have you never been a teenager dancing in your room? Locked yourself in your room and danced? No, me, I think this is something normal. Dance is something you do, to. . .</p> <p><strong>Questioner:</strong> To survive?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I don't know how to say to survive but I agree with that completely. But it's something you do especially when you're on your own. It has a special meaning, you know. It is a memory of mine, being teenage in my room. But I think, Beau Travail has a different approach, it has something that was part of the discipline of those men together and to approach it with something that was strong enough to create something in the film - was to work with this choreographer, Bernardo [Montet], that Denis mentioned. We never thought we were doing dance, we never pronounced the word dance as we were working - we were doing the training, you know, but it slowly became like a dance, but it was not. . .</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> And earlier in your career, you also worked with Jerome Savari. . . did that involve dance in any way?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> No, but I was doing electrics and things, I was not involved in his work. I was rigging the bulbs.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> [To Denis Lavant] What is it like working with Claire Denis? How is she as a director?</p> <p><strong>DL: </strong> [approximate translation of his reply] For me it was an encounter, because I didn't know Claire at all. I had never seen her films, because I never go to the cinema. It was a great pleasure to work and to communicate on the set - I didn't have an impression of being supervised - how can I explain? She was there in a firm way, in a directive way, providing confidence, a framework, someone to talk to. There was the idea of a character, the thoughts of character that interested me, that existed in the world of Billy Budd - the descriptions of the mental mechanisms of that life of the ghetto - these provided a base. But after there was a framework - some rules of driving - Claire gave me a licence to propose a sense that the character existed. She helped me discover a mode of communication that influenced me greatly. We discovered the poem that helped us with the shooting.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> [translating DL's reply] Because there was this mechanism of the characters of Claggart and Galoup in the film with envy and the jealousy, on top of that he had to make the character realistic as a Foreign Legion sergeant but with that there was a great freedom. Also Claire had given him Melville's poems which were very well translated into French. . .</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> I think that Denis was saying was that it was very mysterious the way I thought Denis would be that Galoup. Denis was mentioning that we communicate through Melville's poem more than through the psychological aspect of this guy full of desire of being perfect and full of envy. I think it's true that we sat down every day, reading poetry before going shooting. We did communicate much more like that - through Melville rather than through explanation of. . . I don't know, it was easier - and also we communicated through the physical effort of being under that sun and in that landscape. To explain to someone to do this, to be Galoup is almost there - </p> <p>DL: Galoup is a narrator. . .</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> So Galoup is the narrator of the story - actually Claggart is not the narrator of the Melville story. . .</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Galoup is.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> So as narrator he is very much directing the story, he is bringing it about - there is a complicity that he feels with the camera.</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Yeah, for instance we had always in mind that we would try to look at Galoup as if through the landscape so that we knew that the story was in the past for him.</p> <p>Q: Can you tell us about working with the director of photography Agn\u00e8s Godard and the jazz musician Abdullah Ibrahim?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> She [Godard] was actually in all my films but one. She started by doing camera operating and became DP afterwards, and we were in the same school. We've been learning to work together, in a way she is a companion of my work, like Jean-Pol [Fargeau] with whom I write the script. Both of them have been a part of my work since I started. Abdullah Ibrahim is different. He's a musician I really like and he was also a friend of Ornette Coleman since the 70s. As he was one of the formidable, interesting musicians of the free jazz experience. When I wrote my first script, I didn't mind his music from South Africa, as he was exiled from South Africa. I saw this music was carrying this sort of regret for a country that he doesn't live in any more. I wrote him a letter and he answered and we collaborated on two films.</p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> Have ethnographic films - for example directors like Jean Rouch - influenced you in any respect?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> In a way I feel obliged to respect Jean Rouch because I am told he is very important. I must say I always felt amazed and almost from a different planet, you know. I like to share something with the people I film. I understand, I've seen all his films and I've always been interested in his films, but it's separate. I don't know. It's hard for me to express what I feel in a Jean Rouch movie, but I feel like the planet is divided into sections - and to me it's not like that - so that's what I can say.</p> <p><strong>Q6:</strong> The creases are very important in Beau Travail</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> The commandant says that the elegant exterior will create interior elegance - that is why the pleats are important. That sentence I heard from an officer in the Legion and I was completely amazed and I tried to think about it and then I knew, I read and I knew - a shirt - even if you are in a camp in the desert, a shirt should have three folds in the back. When they are in the camp, they should manage themselves. So that's how we wrote that scene where they were ironing. And the laundry was also something I knew exists, but because we were only fifteen - because before ironing you have to wash and dry the laundry - and it was for me the image of the army. We were only fifteen soldiers and I thought the laundry drying on the lines were - so we wrote it like that in the script - that it was the army itself drying on lines as the exercises were to walk also on lines. So we already did that kind of connection in the script. That's why it was easy to make, because everyone felt rehearsed like that.</p> <p><strong>Q7:</strong> What are your influences as a film-maker? </p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> To make my answer short - it's may be by being in the audience as a spectator that films really worked on me for years, like Le Petit Soldat. Working on movies as an assistant director (eg with Rivette or Wim Wenders) was sharing that person's approach. The films we were working on, in a way I don't know these films so well. The relationship is from inside, but it's maybe as part of the audience that I learn from movies more than anything. I think working as an assistant was a part of knowing people who like cinema and to learn from a movie you have to watch it. To me, it's my experience. I learnt more from Le Petit Soldat than from Paris, Texas.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Can you tell us something very quickly about the film that you're finishing at the moment, which is with Vincent Gallo, Trouble Everyday?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> The film is called Trouble Everyday and I must say, really that it's really a good title, since we've started. And I wish I could find another title because it is trouble everyday. I don't know, it's still, it has vague shape, but it's not yet a film. It's something that is on its way to being a film. It's true that there is Vincent Gallo and Alex Descas and Beatrice Dalle and Tricia Vessey, but it's not yet a film.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Well it's tantalising. Are the three of you [ie Lavant, Denis and Subor] going to work together again?</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> I hope, really hope so. I think Denis and I, we have some ideas about working together again - and I think with Michel too.</p> <p><strong>JR:</strong> Well I will always get my shirts ironed by the Foreign Legion in future. Thank you, all three of you for coming tonight.</p> <p><strong>CD:</strong> Thank you very much.</p>",

A guy who stays so long in the Legion would have a heavy past and in France would have some connection with the Algerian war. I think Le Petit Soldat is the film that I like - more than like - I think it's a part of my life of film-making. Le Petit Soldat is very important. Michel Subor is part of that and I always wanted to work with him. Sometimes I was too shy to ask, but I always wanted this. I saw this was the right moment to ask him to be in it and therefore I wanted him to be called Bruno Forestier, to have the bracelet and to be the same guy. Because at the end of Le Petit Soldat he shoots the guy from the Algerian Secret Service and he has escaped from the French army so he has no place to go . . . MS: Yes, you quit something to get into something else - that's the reason of the Foreign Legion - you enter a new family, a new life - and he's entering this. JR: Working with Denis, could you see Galoup already in the character we know from the Leos Carax films? CD: Well, as I said before, I would not have been able to make the movie without Denis, and Denis doesn't speak English, so he doesn't understand a word of what I am saying [laughter]. He was part of the project from the first day. Also because I knew Denis from Leos Carax movies, and also from the theatre, he works a lot in the theatre. The project was linked to him right from the beginning. JR: It's a very physical role, Galoup. How did you do the manoeuvres and the dance? Did you practice, you were trained? DL: Yes, we were trained. Physically, I was already in okay physical condition. You have to be somewhat fit when you work in the theatre - a little bit! Further to this, however, we also worked for a month with a choreographer, Bernardo Montet who made us work like animals to learn the ways of the Legion - not only the drill and the endurance, but also the more difficult - the instinctive choreography. In fact, as I was involved in the theatre, I could not participate fully in rehearsals, if the truth be told. Yet, it was when I actually arrived there, at Djibouti, I had to be 100% in perfect shape in order to play a character who is a legionnaire, who has been there for fifteen years. To be credible I had to become a part of the country, almost. It is this that I disappeared into and it was a pure pleasure throughout the film to completely immerse myself in the culture of Djibouti and in the volcanic rhythms of the film. . . I could go on for hours (laughs). I would like to add something that interests me very much, that Claire mentioned earlier, while we were speaking on the train, about working from another script to rehearse something that is entirely different. For me, I practise juggling to help with the more tedious training - to help keep my head free. JR: Denis took his juggling material with him to Djibouti to practise, because Claire has the practice of rehearsing not with the scripts that they're actually going to film but with other texts. So he was working on other texts as well, which was his juggling. Let's have some questions because we have time. Q1: Did you get the scene [in Beau Travail] where they're circling each other from Once upon a Time in the West? CD: I thought of that when we did the editing. But the thing is, it was a real exercise that you learn doing martial arts - to walk in a circle and always look at the enemy's eyes. So we trained that with Bernardo Montet. After training on that exercise we decided to keep it in the movie. There was a scene in the script where they were facing each other, looking at each other with a fierce look and we so turned it into that, you know. When we were in the editing room I thought 'That's like a Sergio Leone movie'. I was amazed. Q2: Where is the Lithuanian driving to at the end of J'ai pas Sommeil? CD: I wanted her to drive back to Vilnius with the money. But I wanted to go and film her driving to Vilnius. But we couldn't make that so we were just able to have her drive off from Paris but that was the main idea, to have her drive back home. Q3: What does dancing mean to you? CD: I don't know. Have you never been a teenager dancing in your room? Locked yourself in your room and danced? No, me, I think this is something normal. Dance is something you do, to. . . Questioner: To survive? CD: Yeah, exactly. I don't know how to say to survive but I agree with that completely. But it's something you do especially when you're on your own. It has a special meaning, you know. It is a memory of mine, being teenage in my room. But I think, Beau Travail has a different approach, it has something that was part of the discipline of those men together and to approach it with something that was strong enough to create something in the film - was to work with this choreographer, Bernardo [Montet], that Denis mentioned. We never thought we were doing dance, we never pronounced the word dance as we were working - we were doing the training, you know, but it slowly became like a dance, but it was not. . . JR: And earlier in your career, you also worked with Jerome Savari. . . did that involve dance in any way? CD: No, but I was doing electrics and things, I was not involved in his work. I was rigging the bulbs. Q4: [To Denis Lavant] What is it like working with Claire Denis? How is she as a director? DL: [approximate translation of his reply] For me it was an encounter, because I didn't know Claire at all. I had never seen her films, because I never go to the cinema. It was a great pleasure to work and to communicate on the set - I didn't have an impression of being supervised - how can I explain? She was there in a firm way, in a directive way, providing confidence, a framework, someone to talk to. There was the idea of a character, the thoughts of character that interested me, that existed in the world of Billy Budd - the descriptions of the mental mechanisms of that life of the ghetto - these provided a base. But after there was a framework - some rules of driving - Claire gave me a licence to propose a sense that the character existed. She helped me discover a mode of communication that influenced me greatly. We discovered the poem that helped us with the shooting. JR: [translating DL's reply] Because there was this mechanism of the characters of Claggart and Galoup in the film with envy and the jealousy, on top of that he had to make the character realistic as a Foreign Legion sergeant but with that there was a great freedom. Also Claire had given him Melville's poems which were very well translated into French. . . CD: I think that Denis was saying was that it was very mysterious the way I thought Denis would be that Galoup. Denis was mentioning that we communicate through Melville's poem more than through the psychological aspect of this guy full of desire of being perfect and full of envy. I think it's true that we sat down every day, reading poetry before going shooting. We did communicate much more like that - through Melville rather than through explanation of. . . I don't know, it was easier - and also we communicated through the physical effort of being under that sun and in that landscape. To explain to someone to do this, to be Galoup is almost there - DL: Galoup is a narrator. . . JR: So Galoup is the narrator of the story - actually Claggart is not the narrator of the Melville story. . . CD: Galoup is. JR: So as narrator he is very much directing the story, he is bringing it about - there is a complicity that he feels with the camera. CD: Yeah, for instance we had always in mind that we would try to look at Galoup as if through the landscape so that we knew that the story was in the past for him. Q: Can you tell us about working with the director of photography Agn\u00e8s Godard and the jazz musician Abdullah Ibrahim? CD: She [Godard] was actually in all my films but one. She started by doing camera operating and became DP afterwards, and we were in the same school. We've been learning to work together, in a way she is a companion of my work, like Jean-Pol [Fargeau] with whom I write the script. Both of them have been a part of my work since I started. Abdullah Ibrahim is different. He's a musician I really like and he was also a friend of Ornette Coleman since the 70s. As he was one of the formidable, interesting musicians of the free jazz experience. When I wrote my first script, I didn't mind his music from South Africa, as he was exiled from South Africa. I saw this music was carrying this sort of regret for a country that he doesn't live in any more. I wrote him a letter and he answered and we collaborated on two films. Q5: Have ethnographic films - for example directors like Jean Rouch - influenced you in any respect? CD: In a way I feel obliged to respect Jean Rouch because I am told he is very important. I must say I always felt amazed and almost from a different planet, you know. I like to share something with the people I film. I understand, I've seen all his films and I've always been interested in his films, but it's separate. I don't know. It's hard for me to express what I feel in a Jean Rouch movie, but I feel like the planet is divided into sections - and to me it's not like that - so that's what I can say. Q6: The creases are very important in Beau Travail CD: The commandant says that the elegant exterior will create interior elegance - that is why the pleats are important. That sentence I heard from an officer in the Legion and I was completely amazed and I tried to think about it and then I knew, I read and I knew - a shirt - even if you are in a camp in the desert, a shirt should have three folds in the back. When they are in the camp, they should manage themselves. So that's how we wrote that scene where they were ironing. And the laundry was also something I knew exists, but because we were only fifteen - because before ironing you have to wash and dry the laundry - and it was for me the image of the army. We were only fifteen soldiers and I thought the laundry drying on the lines were - so we wrote it like that in the script - that it was the army itself drying on lines as the exercises were to walk also on lines. So we already did that kind of connection in the script. That's why it was easy to make, because everyone felt rehearsed like that. Q7: What are your influences as a film-maker? CD: To make my answer short - it's may be by being in the audience as a spectator that films really worked on me for years, like Le Petit Soldat. Working on movies as an assistant director (eg with Rivette or Wim Wenders) was sharing that person's approach. The films we were working on, in a way I don't know these films so well. The relationship is from inside, but it's maybe as part of the audience that I learn from movies more than anything. I think working as an assistant was a part of knowing people who like cinema and to learn from a movie you have to watch it. To me, it's my experience. I learnt more from Le Petit Soldat than from Paris, Texas. JR: Can you tell us something very quickly about the film that you're finishing at the moment, which is with Vincent Gallo, Trouble Everyday? CD: The film is called Trouble Everyday and I must say, really that it's really a good title, since we've started. And I wish I could find another title because it is trouble everyday. I don't know, it's still, it has vague shape, but it's not yet a film. It's something that is on its way to being a film. It's true that there is Vincent Gallo and Alex Descas and Beatrice Dalle and Tricia Vessey, but it's not yet a film. JR: Well it's tantalising. Are the three of you [ie Lavant, Denis and Subor] going to work together again? CD: I hope, really hope so. I think Denis and I, we have some ideas about working together again - and I think with Michel too. JR: Well I will always get my shirts ironed by the Foreign Legion in future. Thank you, all three of you for coming tonight. CD: Thank you very much.",

      "bodyText": "Dutch police were today holding six people following the deaths of 58 Chinese immigrants found in the back of a lorry in Dover. One of the six is a 24-year-old owner of a transport company. The arrests follow the discovery by Rotterdam detectives of a harbour-side warehouse used to transport the immigrants. One suspect was still on the run and an international arrest warrant was issued for him. A 55-year-old suspect was earlier released by police. Shocked customs officers discovered 58 bodies - and two survivors - in a sealed lorry container at the port in Kent just before midnight on Sunday June 18. An inquest heard how they had suffocated in the back of the sealed lorry which had its refrigeration unit turned off on one of the hottest days of the year. A spokesman for the Dutch police said: \"The Netherlands and Great Britain have exchanged a number of detectives in order to optimise the effectiveness and efficiency of both investigations. \"Meanwhile, the Dutch police have managed to get a pretty clear picture of the organisation and of the individuals that have been organising the transport as well as the manner in which the suspects may have been involved. \"In broad terms it appears that the organisation has rented a warehouse especially for the purpose of the smuggling operation and has a transport company register in the name of a front man. \"After that an articulated truck and container have been purchased.

Police said they will not name any of the victims until all 58 bodies have been identified and their families contacted. A spokesman for Kent police said: \"We are aware that further arrests have been made in Holland and have been continually liasing with our Dutch counterparts.\" Dutch lorry driver Perry Wacker, 32, of Rotterdam, appeared before Folkestone Magistrates on June 24, charged with the manslaughter of the 58 immigrants.

But it adds: \"Worryingly ... there is little evidence of any correlation between the quality of an LEA as an organisation and the standards achieved in its schools.\" The leadership of the headteacher is far more crucial, the report says. Ofsted is developing a new way of measuring LEA performance, using 46 individual tests ranked 1-7. Inspections have been completed for more than half the 150 LEAs in England. Warwickshire, Kensington and Chelsea and the Corporation of London - which has only one secondary school - are the only LEAs so far to achieve a 1 grade overall. There was praise from David Singleton, Ofsted's head of inspections, for Tower Hamlets and Manchester, for responding positively to Ofsted reports which found serious weaknesses. Calderdale and Hackney had made some progress, but Southwark and Sandwell had regressed. The report also sees a \"growing polarisation\" between well-run and poor LEAs. There was often no more than \"lip service\" to school autonomy, and \"nostalgia for control\". It says school visits by LEA officials happen too frequently and are often unnecessary. Estelle Morris, the schools standards minister, said the disparity in delivery by LEAs was not acceptable. \"LEAs must adapt to meet the demands of the changing world and not seek to control schools.\" Doug McAvoy, the NUT's general secretary, said: \"Ofsted's job is to evaluate but yet again it is overstepping the mark and making recommendations in the political arena.\" Well run LEA, and high performing schools: Cornwall, North Somerset, Kingston upon Thames, Bury, Surrey, Rutland, Warwickshire. Well run LEA, and low performing schools: Barking and Dagenham, Birmingham, Newham, Sunderland, Knowsley, Kingston upon Hull, Kirklees, Newcastle upon Tyne. LEA with significant weaknesses, and average or high performing schools: Bedfordshire, Calderdale, Kent, Buckinghamshire. LEA with weaknesses, and low performing schools: Hackney, Manchester, Sandwell, Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Barnsley, Islington, Liverpool, Haringey, Leicester \u0095 Liverpool University is setting up what it claims is Europe's first degree to be available to students only via the internet. The masters in information technology will be available to 20 students a year.",

      "bodyText": "Extra resources to raise standards in health, education and crime prevention in Britain's poorest areas are to be provided by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, next month in a bid to tackle deep-rooted poverty and cut unemployment. David Blunkett, Alan Milburn and Jack Straw have all been offered additional resources for the next three years in return for agreeing to set extra targets to raise performance in the most disadvantaged areas of the country. The move is part of a Treasury blueprint under which ministers will get a share of a \u00a340bn boost to public spending in return for greater cooperation across departments to tackle problems in 13 areas. The spending plans will set \"floor targets\" for the delivery of key public services in poor parts of the country. The chancellor, who is blamed by some in the party for excessively tight curbs on spending in the government's first two years, intends to use his comprehensive spending review to kick-start Tony Blair's election campaign. The government, rattled by loss of support in its heartlands, is convinced votes will be won and lost on the traditional battlegrounds of health, education and the economy rather than on Europe. It will announce plans to supplement the \u00a313bn increase in NHS spending with a \u00a328bn boost to expenditure in other areas. Final negotiations are underway between spending ministers and the treasury, but Mr Blunkett and John Prescott will get extra cash for schools and transport. Mr Brown is stressing that the conditions for a return to full employment will depend on combined action across departments. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit is at a 20-year low following more than eight years of economic growth. But although some Treasury officials think the jobless total - now 1,109,000 - may have dropped below 1m by the election, the chancellor will stress that full employment will only be achieved by co-ordinating action across Whitehall to tackle social exclusion and Britain's productivity deficit with other industrial nations. \"We have to recognise that the potential for full employment exists, but that means we have to start dealing with much harder cases than has the New Deal,\" said one government source. \"What you will see is the spending review for the second New Deal.\" The bulk of the cross-departmental groups deal with domestic problems such as the 100,000 young people not in school, work, training or claiming benefit. The government believes a strategy for young people at risk needs to look at jobs, housing, drugs and crime - incorporating the work of the Department for Education and Employment, the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Home Office and the Department of Health. The Treasury's influence on Labour's domestic agenda is increased as a result of the changes to be announced next month, with Mr Brown and his team setting targets for cross-departmental initiatives and holding ministers accountable for shared budgets. The 13 cross-departmental groups are welfare to work, Sure Start and services for the under fives, young people at risk, support for older people, the criminal justice system, drugs, crime reduction, local government finance, government intervention in deprived areas, rural and countryside programmes, science and research, conflict prevention in sub-Saharan Africa, and nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union. Mr Brown maintained tough curbs on spending inherited from the last Conservative chancellor, Kenneth Clarke but in his first three-year spending plan in 1998 increased spending by 3% overall in real terms and by around 5% on health and education.",

      "bodyText": "London mayor Ken Livingstone today launched a scathing attack on government control of local councils, saying British town halls have no more independence than the Vichy regime did under the Nazis. He accused \"aliens\" in the Treasury of undermining local government and said they treated democratically-elected people with contempt. In his most strongly-worded attack since winning the election in May, Mr Livingstone told the local government association's newspaper it was time for councils to fight back. \"From the end of the 1980s on, local government has had no more independence in Britain than the Vichy regime had in France under the Nazis,\" Mr Livingstone said. \"So you just do your best to try and protect your local people as best you can.\" Mr Livingstone blamed the Treasury for leading the 20-year attack on local government. \"The Treasury has always had a contempt for democratically-elected people in Parliament, let alone local government,\" he said. \"For years the Treasury has been run by aliens whose objective is the destruction of all life on this planet and they're just starting with local government services.\" Mr Livingstone also criticised the government's handling of asylum seekers, saying: \"I have never seen the collapse of administration in any local authority that I have witnessed over the last three years in the government's immigration and asylum directorate. \"Literally, no-one in central government is in a position to lecture local government about waste or incompetence or corruption.\" His comments about the Treasury could reignite his long-running feud with chancellor Gordon Brown, whose economic policies he has criticised in the past, although Mr Livingstone later said his remarks had been tinged with a \"smidgen of humour\". They will also scotch hopes that Mr Livingstone was set to take a more conciliatory tone towards the Government since becoming the first directly-elected Mayor of London. Home secretary Jack Straw took a moderate tone in dismissing Mr Livingstone's remark saying his comments about the Vichy regime were \"a bit of Ken extravagance\". Mr Straw said that the government was giving councils new powers such as over the control of pub licensing and more freedoms would follow. \"The balance is going to shift. There will always be tension between central and local government and that is not only necessary but desirable,\" said Mr Straw. Chairman of the local government association Sir Jeremy Beecham called the comparison with Vichy \"ludicrous\" and \"counter-productive\" but accepted that he would agree with Mr Livingstone on \"a lot of the points\".",

And an overwhelmingly powerful French army, lead by General Andoche Junot, rolls into Lisbon forcing the flamboyant Portuguese to surrender. The humiliated Portugeezers who are left standing swear they'll take the sweetest of revenges on Napoleon -when those Frenchies least expect it. And so they wait. And they wait some more. Until finally - more than 176 years later - they get their chance. In France. In the semi-final of Euro 84. Perfect! And it's all going perfectly - until, once again, they surrender - this time to the midfield maestro Michel Platini.</p> <p>No doubt sensing a pattern, Christophe Dugarry seemed particularly keen to stress Gallic superiority ahead of tonight's mouthwatering Euro 2000 semi-final. \"Portugal are the masters of dribbling and keeping the ball but they'll have to surrender against us because overall we're much stronger than they are,\" he boasted earlier today. And his team-mate Marcel Desailly was quick to join in. \"They have deserved to get this far. But this is the last step so there is more pressure. It must be even worse for Portugal because they have to play against the world champions.\" And to think that some people think the French are arrogant!</p> <p>Only coach Roger Lemerre demurred. \"Portugal should be regarded as the favourites against France,\" he said behind his hand while no-one was looking. \"They are in the last four because they have no weaknesses. They reached the semi-finals easily while we had to fight for it.\" Lemerre won't name his team until an hour before kick-off, but seems likely to bring back He Is Emmanuel Petit, who has recovered from a knee injury. Pat Vieira is - according to most reports - also a certain starter, so either Youri Djorkaeff or Christophe Dugarry is expected to make way. </p> <p>Meanwhile Portugal coach Humberto Coelho, who is presiding over a much more modest camp (\"We have a lot of respect for France but we're going to do our best to try and win\" was Dumas's response to a question about tonight's game), is set to make two changes. Salad cream-haired Abel Xavier and midfield hard-man Paulo Sousa are likely to return in place of Costinha and Concei\u00e7ao, as Coelho opts for a slightly more defensive line-up.

Which could quite easily have ruined Kelvin's enjoyment of This Morning this morning.</p> <p>\"For England the lessons of yesterday never seem to impact on the fevered anticipation of tomorrow, and K[oo]gan added to the delusion\", said the report, mocking supporters, overpaid sportswriters, and badger-haired supremos alike. The report goes on to assert (quite boldly) that the reason the English were so deluded was because they thought their team was OK when it was in fact rubbish. \"Keegan's main complaint was that his players could not pass the ball with any great efficiency,\" it says, \"but, with the exceptions of David Beckham and Paul Scholes, that has been obvious for some time.\"</p> <p>Oooooohh. What made these otherwise routine remarks a bit special was that they came without a byline (which means 'name' but is much more sophisticated), leading to the assumption that this was Uefa's official verdict on team Koogan, rather than the rantings of some work experience child from Oost-Vlaanderen. An error which Uefa was naturally determined to clear up. \"We are very sorry if it has offended anybody,\" said spokesman Graham Turner today. \"But, having said that, we have to take our share of the blame and say we should have filtered it before it went on.\" Well it's all very well saying that, but the damage has already been done, hasn't it eh?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I'm looking into the possible legal steps I can take.

Mr Hague challenged the prime minister, Tony Blair, on the price of a litre of petrol, which he said had gone up at the pumps by 44% since Labour came to power, 34% of which was due to tax increases. Petrol rises in the budget were calculated on an inflation rate of 3.4%, whereas pension increases were based on a rate of 1.1%, due to changes introduced by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, the Tory leader told the Commons. \"Isn't the time coming when the people who can't afford to run a car will take their revenge on the people who can't manage to run a government?\" asked Mr Hague. The prime minister admitted petrol had gone up by 18p a litre - but of this, only 2p was due to fuel duty. The rest was down to rising oil prices from producer nations, affecting not only Britain, but the rest of the world. Mr Blair said the government had chosen to spend money on schools, hospitals and paying off the national debt rather than keeping petrol taxes down, saying: \"If he [Mr Hague] is now telling us he would cut fuel duty, it would mean that the money we are putting into schools and hospitals is money he would also cut.\" Voters would conclude the Tories were worse and \"more extreme than ever\", the prime minister told the House. Conservative MP for Billericay Teresa Gorman asked about the role of the prime minister's spokesman, Alistair Campbell's request to government departments that they produce a number of good news stories over the next two months to cheer up the Labour party's image. Mr Blair replied that Mr Campbell had no need to ask government departments to produce a quota of such stories, in view of the government's numerous successes in areas such as school literacy and unemployment. Mr Campbell \"needn't have sent it [the request] out, we can do it ourselves,\" he said.",

Domestic consumption of drugs is becoming \"more serious with each passing day\", according to an official white paper.

The two traffickers, Chen Xinyuan from Taiwan and Tsai Dehui from Hong Kong, had been found guilty of smuggling large quantities of heroin into Taiwan. They lost their final appeal in April. Details of the case were published on a new website belonging to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing which rejected their appeal.

Executions in China are often preceded in serious cases by a \"sentencing rally\" at which speeches are made denouncing the crime, and the guilty verdicts are read out. The actual execution - by a bullet through the head - takes place privately. China's policy of exemplary execution has been criticised as \"inhumane\" by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations, but it finds favour with many Chinese who are alarmed by the growth of crime. China's government State Council has reinforced the campaign in the white paper, which acknowledges that \"the situation is grim for the anti-drug struggle.\" The document is the latest in a series of increasingly frank statements about the rise in drug use and related problems, including HIV and Aids.

The State Council appealed to the Chinese people to rekindle the spirit of the 1950s when, after the communist revolution, the use of opium was said to have been wiped out in three years. In another symbolic action on Monday, large quantities of confiscated heroin and the methamphetamine \"ice\" were burned at Humen in south China.

      "body": "<p>I have always maintained that the strength of the newspaper industry's system of self-regulation lies both in the protection that the code of practice gives to ordinary people and the ability of the press complaints commission to deal quickly and effectively with complaints from members of the public about intrusion and inaccuracy. </p> <p>While it may be complaints from the prime minister and the Prince of Wales, or from celebrities like Paul McCartney and Elton John, that grab the headlines, the real success story lies in the quiet work we do day in and day out to sort out problems brought to us by ordinary people. </p> <p>And it lies, too, in the unsung success of the editors' code of practice which - over the last 10 years - has slowly and surely, and usually unnoticed by our critics, transformed standards of newspaper reporting. </p> <p>Ten years ago, simple inaccuracies about people that most of us had never heard of went uncorrected. Intrusions into the private lives of ordinary people by a handful of newspapers were all too common. </p> <p>Today, we live in a different world - one in which a tough code of practice ensures that most inaccuracies are corrected, that intrusion and harassment are by and large prevented, and that a great deal of protection is given to the most vulnerable members of our society such as the sick, victims of assault and, above all, children. </p> <p>So that is what the vast bulk of our work is all about. Raising standards of reporting. Sorting out disputes. Serving the public. Protecting the vulnerable. </p> <p>But while I am acutely aware that most of what we do relates to ordinary people, I am also aware that the success of self regulation rests in many ways on how the press deals with the privacy of public figures - and in turn how the PCC deals with complaints from those individuals when something has gone wrong. </p> <p>In short, while we always apply the code in equal measure to everyone in the land, ordinary people know it works to protect them if they see it protecting the most famous. </p> <p>And while we will always treat every complainant equally, ordinary people know the PCC will provide them with commonsense and effective redress when they see us dealing in a quick and sensible manner with high-profile complainants who come to us.</p> <p><strong>Prince William - the original agreement</strong></p> <p>That is one of the reasons why, almost exactly five years ago and in this very same room, I set out my thinking on how newspapers should treat Prince William and Prince Harry during their time at school. </p> <p>I believed it was important for self-regulation, for the industry - and, most important of all, for those young men. You may recall that I argued then that the press had always had a very important role in scrutinising the monarchy and should continue to do so - but that such scrutiny did not mean intruding into the privacy of children. </p> <p>It was in that speech that I set out the basis of an understanding designed to give the royal princes as much privacy as possible, while at the same time allowing the press and the public - rightly anxious to see the way these two young men were growing up - legitimate access to them. </p> <p>At the heart of that agreement was the industry's code and its stipulations about the treatment of children. I made clear that the terms of the code related as much to Princes William and Harry as to any other children. </p> <p>Nobody was asking for extra protection, or less protection - simply the same respect for their privacy. That meant no interviewing or photographing without the consent of the parents or of the school authorities - and it meant no long-lens photos or harassment either. </p> <p>In turn, recognising the legitimate public interest in the children, the Palace agreed to ensure that photographs and information about the children were from time to time made available to the press and the broadcasters. </p> <p>It was a balancing act - legitimate privacy and legitimate access: In other words, a commonsense solution based on the terms of a commonsense code of practice. </p> <p>Of course, a great deal had happened since then - most important of which was the tightening of the industry's code after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. </p> <p>That added significantly to the protection available to all children - including Prince William and Prince Harry - by adding a stipulation that children should be entitled to complete their time at school without intrusion. </p> <p>That tightening of the code led to a review of the agreement between the Palace and the press. New guidelines, issued in April 1999, tackled the issue of so-called cumulative intrusion as a result of an accumulation of apparently harmless stories about the princes. </p> <p>It was, I believe, a practical and commonsense set of changes which have proved very effective over the last year.</p> <p><strong>Has it worked?</strong></p> <p>That, then, has been the theory. But how has it all worked out in practice? </p> <p>The answer, I believe, is that it has been a considerable success story for self-regulation - and highly beneficial for the two young men at the centre of our concerns today. </p> <p>As far as I am aware, for the best part of five years no unauthorised pictures of either of the boys at school appeared in a British publication - although St James's Palace has registered its concern with me about pictures which appeared in a Sunday newspaper a fortnight ago. </p> <p>That is a matter into which I am still looking. </p> <p>I should emphasise that this broad picture of substantial restraint has been all the more admirable given that pictures of the princes appear with monotony abroad - particularly in countries like France, where privacy laws are theoretically supposed to protect the privacy of the individual, but lamentably fail so to do. </p> <p>Furthermore, there has - as far as I am aware - been no physical intrusion or harassment of the boys at school. </p> <p>Five years ago, there was a regular crowd of paparazzi at Eton. The success of the code has caused that problem in large part to disappear: paparazzi seldom hang around if there is no market available for their pictures. </p> <p>Nor has there been any attempt by any publication to interview either of the boys, or - again so far as I am aware - any of their friends, in strict accordance with the code. </p> <p>That has been a substantial success - and provided the boys with a degree of personal privacy that I suspect none of their forebears received. For that, enormous credit must go to editors of all national and local newspapers and periodicals, and to their reporters as well. </p> <p>By respecting the privacy of these children, they have shown how the code works, and how importantly editors take the work of the PCC. It has certainly confounded the detractors of self-regulation. </p> <p>Some of them said that it would never work, that the children would be hounded. They were all wrong. </p> <p>Of course, it would be surprising if - in five years - there had not been the odd hiccup, but those hiccups have been few and far between. </p> <p>Twice complaints have been made about individual stories - both of which were amicably resolved, and one of which lead to the publication of the revised guidelines. </p> <p>And, inevitably, there have been other stories which have not produced complaints - but with which St James's Palace have had informally and privately to deal. But the broad picture has been one of commendable restraint - especially on the use of photographs, and on the issue of physical harassment. </p> <p>And we have had other hiccups in more recent days. The last fortnight has sadly been marked by a number of controversies relating to the copyrighting and publication of photographs to coincide with Prince William's 18th birthday. </p> <p>Indeed, it was that controversy which caused me to postpone this speech - which I had intended to deliver a fortnight ago. </p> <p>Given that my message today is one of great praise for editors, and for the co-operation that has taken place for most of the last five years, this is not the time or the place for a post mortem on these recent events and I do not intend to deliver one. </p> <p>However, I have to underline one point. Given that the future protection of Prince William's privacy is going to rely to some extent on continued co-operation between Palace and press, I have been monitoring the events of recent weeks with some care - and discussed with St James's Palace the lessons to be learned from them. </p> <p>I am satisfied from those discussions that the lessons have indeed been learned - and that the Palace is now in a position to be able to deliver the co-operation that is required to make this work.</p> <p><strong>Photographs</strong></p> <p>First, then, photographs. The question of what photographs of Prince William will be published is, in many ways, the most important one for editors and for the readers of newspapers. </p> <p>Over the last few years, relatively few photographs of Prince William - or, indeed, of Prince Harry - have been published because of the tight restrictions in the code. That prohibits photographs taken and published without the consent either of parents or of school authorities. </p> <p>From tomorrow, he will cease to benefit from that protection - and he can expect to be photographed in public places like any other young adult. </p> <p>If, therefore, he is playing polo, or shopping in Oxford Street, or sitting outside a pub, then he will from time to time be photographed and those pictures are likely to be published. </p> <p>That is likely to mean that newspaper readers are going to be seeing somewhat more of him in the future. </p> <p>There are, of course, caveats to that. The first is that neither I, nor the editors I have discussed this with, can foresee any circumstances in which it will be justifiable to publish pictures of Prince William that have been obtained as a result of intimidation or harassment or persistent pursuit - points I want to talk further about at the end of my remarks. </p> <p>The second is that - like every other public figure - there should be no publication of snatched pictures of Prince William taken when he is in a private place, that is somewhere where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. </p> <p>I have made clear to editors, who agree with me, that they should generally regard pictures of him in private gardens, in restaurants and so on as off limits under the code, except - of course - on those rare occasions when there may be a public interest in doing so. </p> <p>In other words, there is going to be an important change in this area -bearing in mind the key caveats that I have also made.</p> <p><strong>Facts</strong></p> <p>Another area where there is going to be further change is that there will inevitably be more stories written about Prince William. </p> <p>Again, the code - with its provision that young people should be able to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion - has meant that hardly any stories about Prince William during his time at Eton have appeared, and rightly so. It has had the same success as far as other young people are concerned. </p> <p>But as he becomes, increasingly, a public figures and is away from his school environment, there are going to be more stories written about what he gets up to in public. </p> <p>As there are likely to be more stories, I think it sensible simply to underline a number of points about factual accuracy. </p> <p>I think most people in public life grudgingly accept the fact that sometimes things get written about them which are unfair, misleading or downright wrong. </p> <p>Certainly, I can think of a number of things that have been written about me which bear not even a passing resemblance to the truth. But it happens, usually by accident. </p> <p>If it is a point of no consequence, most of us let it pass. If it is a serious matter, I always encourage people to take it up with the editors - and, if that fails, take it to the PCC. Most significant inaccuracies are quickly put right that way. </p> <p>However, while older members of the royal family may themselves from time to time attract a degree of speculation and conjecture in stories about them, a public figure like Prince William who is also a very young man should be entitled to expect that things that are written about him are accurate. </p> <p>He should not have to read about how he is part of a so-called 'set' that is involved with drugs - when he has never been part of that 'set'. </p> <p>He should not have to read about family arguments that he is purported to have had when he hasn't had them. </p> <p>He should not have to read about how he is having a relationship with a girl that he has never met. </p> <p>Such inaccuracies are in many ways worse than an intrusion into privacy because they create a misleading impression, and - as the old saying goes - mud sticks. In some cases, particularly where other individuals are involved, it can damage more than one person. </p> <p>To give you an example, in recent weeks the PCC has been involved both formally and informally with investigations relating to two or three newspapers that have run stories about alleged relationships of Prince William. </p> <p>What has struck me during all these is the potential damage that can be done to the girls concerned, and the embarrassment they may well be caused - let alone how such stories affect Prince William. </p> <p>In each case, the PCC has reminded editors of the importance of accuracy in these matters, and I take the opportunity to do so again today. </p> <p>In other words, where newspapers or magazines are writing about Prince William they must take care under the code to ensure the stories are right - which will usually mean not relying simply on the word of those who may well turn out to be troublemakers. </p> <p>Indeed, I was struck recently by a very salient point made to me - that real friends of Prince William will not be seeking to cause mischief by leaking stories to newspapers. </p> <p>Those who do may not turn out to know him quite as well as they pretend - landing editors in trouble as a result. This, in turn, also puts an onus on St James's Palace to ensure that they respond constructively to legitimate inquiries about stories relating to Prince William.</p> <p><strong>Privacy</strong></p> <p>Let me turn next to the perennially contentious area of privacy - first of all by reminding you what the code, written by editors themselves, actually says. </p> <p>Clause three of the code of practice makes clear that everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private life. </p> <p>That part of the code - drawn from the European Convention on Human Rights - is quite clear. Everyone means everyone. </p> <p>As we recently pointed out in an adjudication on a complaint from Ian Brady, even serial killers are entitled to their privacy. </p> <p>It is unthinkable that the second in line to the throne should not be treated to the same respect. </p> <p>But at the same time, we have to recognise - as, indeed, I made clear in my remarks five years ago - that he is different to other people simply because of his position. </p> <p>That means there will be legitimate public interest in stories about him and pictures of him - but not on the basis of a 'free-for-all'. </p> <p>I think at this point, we have to be as clear as we can be about what we mean by 'private life' - because, with people in the public eye, the boundary between what is private and what is public is sometimes indistinct. </p> <p>There are a number of firm pointers in the code itself as to what constitutes a person's private life. </p> <p>It includes someone's: </p> <p>\u0095 Family life (although recognising that other members of his family are, of course, public figures themselves) </p> <p>\u0095 Health </p> <p>\u0095 Personal correspondence </p> <p>\u0095 Telephone conversations </p> <p>\u0095 Space at times of grief and shock </p> <p>\u0095 And (as I made clear earlier) pictures taken in private places. <br></p> <p>It also includes a degree of special protection from physical intrusion when someone is in hospital. </p> <p>That is a carefully delineated area that I think - and editors agree - should generally be regarded as off limits under the code, unless, of course, they are writing about aspects of any of these where there is public interest involved. </p> <p>I can easily see, for instance, occasions on which a report about the Prince's health may well be in the public interest - and the code, of course, allows for that. </p> <p>Beyond those categories, newspaper editors will exercise their usual judgment on what constitutes someone's private life - but it does mean that there are therefore going to be significant areas of his life that can be reported. </p> <p>This might well include, for instance, reports about a job he undertakes in his gap year, or reports of a drama production or a charity event he participates in at university and so on - in other words, things that are not inherently part of someone's private life. </p> <p>Inevitably, the question will be asked - indeed, I seem to have been answering it for many years - about how newspapers should deal with stories which some might consider to be of a romantic nature. </p> <p>First things, first: As I said earlier, they should make sure under the code that they are accurate before they even consider the privacy aspects of the case. </p> <p>I know of three cases in the last two years where - naming no names - three different newspapers have linked Prince William romantically to three different girls. In two cases, he had never met them; in one case, he had met the girl once. </p> <p>Such fundamental inaccuracies are unacceptable - and are damaging, quite apart from anything else, to the poor girls in question, who may or may not already have relationships of their own. </p> <p>I would also add one point here that it can't be acceptable for any newspaper or magazine to deduce a 'relationship' solely from the fact of his being seen on his own with a girl in public. </p> <p>I think we all know the difference between 'friendship' and 'relationship' - and it would be unfair for any newspaper report to deduce one from the other without other supporting evidence. </p> <p>That said, if a story is accurate, then a newspaper should consider - as in any case relating to personal privacy - whether there is either consent, or the material is in the public domain, or there is sufficient and genuine public interest under the code. </p> <p>If none of those factors is present, I would hope any editor would think quite carefully before printing such a story. </p> <p>It is important to remember this: The code says that everyone is entitled to respect for their private life. As far as young people are concerned privacy means, probably more than anything else, that they must have the right to grow up and form relationships without having to read about them week in and week out in the newspapers, or hear about them on the radio and television. </p> <p>Before anyone suggests otherwise, I am a realist. I do not believe it possible or desirable to prohibit newspapers entirely from speculation and reports about young ladies that might eventually become a more permanent feature of his life. </p> <p>But I would say this: endless intrusion of the sort we have not seen for five years and the constant, powerful headlamps of unwarranted publicity would make his life a misery, make his friends' lives a misery and make it much more difficult for him to forge proper and meaningful relationships. </p> <p>So, newspapers must continue to exercise restraint - as they have done in the past. They must continue to check their facts. And they must continue to think about the impact on Prince William of either inaccurate or intrusive stories on this particular subject. </p> <p>I am realist - but this is a very important issue which the PCC will be following closely. And it is one where, I suspect, the public will have strong views as well.</p> <p><strong>Physical intrusion</strong></p> <p>Finally - and this is in many ways the most important part of what I have to say and is certainly a subject on which editors have indicated to me that they also feel very strongly - I would like to highlight the terms of clause four of the code, which deals with harassment. </p> <p>While Prince William has been at school, the code has been very clear on the issue of photography and physical intrusion. </p> <p>Now that those specific provisions no longer apply to him, I have to say that the code is no less clear on the general issue of harassment, which means: </p> <p>\u0095 No persistent pursuit </p> <p>\u0095 No physical intimidation </p> <p>\u0095 And (as I made clear earlier) no photography in private places. </p> <p>In other words, it would be quite unacceptable for paparazzi photographers to pursue Prince William around whichever university he attends - and quite unacceptable for newspapers to publish photographs which have been obtained in this manner. </p> <p>Indeed, no editor that I have spoken to would dream of doing so. </p> <p>The ability of all young people to go about their normal lives without physical intimidation is hugely important. </p> <p>The absence of paparazzi at Eton during these last five years has been a significant success - and a tribute to all editors who have made clear to photographers that there is no market for intrusive pictures. </p> <p>Prince William's 18th birthday is not an invitation for them to return. The PCC will come down hard on the publication of any pictures of Prince William that has been obtained through intimidation or persistent pursuit - just as we would for any other individual.</p> <p><strong>The need for continuing co-operation</strong></p> <p>Those, then, are the key issues I want to highlight today. What we are saying, simply, is that Prince William should continue to be allowed a private life and freedom from harassment in the same way as any other public figure. </p> <p>That is something that will be made much easier - I have no doubt - if there is continuing co-operation between the press and St James's Palace to ensure both that the public sees and reads about Prince William's progress to and through university, and that what is written about him is accurate. </p> <p>Following my intensive discussions with them, I can confirm that the palace fully understands that point - and has made clear that, during his gap year and then during his time at University, regular facilities for the media will be made available to record his progress and continuing education. </p> <p>That way, I am confident that - even though times are changing - the successful balance we have achieved over the last five years can be maintained during the time in which Prince William completes his education. </p> <p>There will be four winners from that. </p> <p>One winner will, of course, be Prince William - who will continue to benefit from the protection of the editors' code and therefore be able to complete his education without unnecessary intrusion. </p> <p>One will be newspapers and magazines - because by continuing to respect his privacy, they will again be demonstrating to the public that the media can act responsibly and sensitively and that self-regulation really works. </p> <p>One will be the public - which has consistently made clear, as the results of an opinion poll last week underlined, that they want to see Prince William grow up with as much privacy as possible. </p> <p>And the final one will be the institution of the monarchy itself. </p> <p>I have always believed that - after many years in which the relationship between press and palaces was fraught and tense - the way that newspapers have respected the privacy of Prince William and Prince Harry has pointed a new, better way forward for the next generation. </p> <p>From that the monarchy itself is bound to benefit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have always maintained that the strength of the newspaper industry's system of self-regulation lies both in the protection that the code of practice gives to ordinary people and the ability of the press complaints commission to deal quickly and effectively with complaints from members of the public about intrusion and inaccuracy. While it may be complaints from the prime minister and the Prince of Wales, or from celebrities like Paul McCartney and Elton John, that grab the headlines, the real success story lies in the quiet work we do day in and day out to sort out problems brought to us by ordinary people. And it lies, too, in the unsung success of the editors' code of practice which - over the last 10 years - has slowly and surely, and usually unnoticed by our critics, transformed standards of newspaper reporting. Ten years ago, simple inaccuracies about people that most of us had never heard of went uncorrected. Intrusions into the private lives of ordinary people by a handful of newspapers were all too common. Today, we live in a different world - one in which a tough code of practice ensures that most inaccuracies are corrected, that intrusion and harassment are by and large prevented, and that a great deal of protection is given to the most vulnerable members of our society such as the sick, victims of assault and, above all, children. So that is what the vast bulk of our work is all about. Raising standards of reporting. Sorting out disputes. Serving the public. Protecting the vulnerable. But while I am acutely aware that most of what we do relates to ordinary people, I am also aware that the success of self regulation rests in many ways on how the press deals with the privacy of public figures - and in turn how the PCC deals with complaints from those individuals when something has gone wrong. In short, while we always apply the code in equal measure to everyone in the land, ordinary people know it works to protect them if they see it protecting the most famous. And while we will always treat every complainant equally, ordinary people know the PCC will provide them with commonsense and effective redress when they see us dealing in a quick and sensible manner with high-profile complainants who come to us. Prince William - the original agreement That is one of the reasons why, almost exactly five years ago and in this very same room, I set out my thinking on how newspapers should treat Prince William and Prince Harry during their time at school. I believed it was important for self-regulation, for the industry - and, most important of all, for those young men. You may recall that I argued then that the press had always had a very important role in scrutinising the monarchy and should continue to do so - but that such scrutiny did not mean intruding into the privacy of children. It was in that speech that I set out the basis of an understanding designed to give the royal princes as much privacy as possible, while at the same time allowing the press and the public - rightly anxious to see the way these two young men were growing up - legitimate access to them. At the heart of that agreement was the industry's code and its stipulations about the treatment of children. I made clear that the terms of the code related as much to Princes William and Harry as to any other children. Nobody was asking for extra protection, or less protection - simply the same respect for their privacy. That meant no interviewing or photographing without the consent of the parents or of the school authorities - and it meant no long-lens photos or harassment either. In turn, recognising the legitimate public interest in the children, the Palace agreed to ensure that photographs and information about the children were from time to time made available to the press and the broadcasters. It was a balancing act - legitimate privacy and legitimate access: In other words, a commonsense solution based on the terms of a commonsense code of practice. Of course, a great deal had happened since then - most important of which was the tightening of the industry's code after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. That added significantly to the protection available to all children - including Prince William and Prince Harry - by adding a stipulation that children should be entitled to complete their time at school without intrusion. That tightening of the code led to a review of the agreement between the Palace and the press. New guidelines, issued in April 1999, tackled the issue of so-called cumulative intrusion as a result of an accumulation of apparently harmless stories about the princes. It was, I believe, a practical and commonsense set of changes which have proved very effective over the last year. Has it worked? That, then, has been the theory. But how has it all worked out in practice? The answer, I believe, is that it has been a considerable success story for self-regulation - and highly beneficial for the two young men at the centre of our concerns today. As far as I am aware, for the best part of five years no unauthorised pictures of either of the boys at school appeared in a British publication - although St James's Palace has registered its concern with me about pictures which appeared in a Sunday newspaper a fortnight ago. That is a matter into which I am still looking. I should emphasise that this broad picture of substantial restraint has been all the more admirable given that pictures of the princes appear with monotony abroad - particularly in countries like France, where privacy laws are theoretically supposed to protect the privacy of the individual, but lamentably fail so to do. Furthermore, there has - as far as I am aware - been no physical intrusion or harassment of the boys at school. Five years ago, there was a regular crowd of paparazzi at Eton. The success of the code has caused that problem in large part to disappear: paparazzi seldom hang around if there is no market available for their pictures. Nor has there been any attempt by any publication to interview either of the boys, or - again so far as I am aware - any of their friends, in strict accordance with the code. That has been a substantial success - and provided the boys with a degree of personal privacy that I suspect none of their forebears received. For that, enormous credit must go to editors of all national and local newspapers and periodicals, and to their reporters as well. By respecting the privacy of these children, they have shown how the code works, and how importantly editors take the work of the PCC. It has certainly confounded the detractors of self-regulation. Some of them said that it would never work, that the children would be hounded. They were all wrong. Of course, it would be surprising if - in five years - there had not been the odd hiccup, but those hiccups have been few and far between. Twice complaints have been made about individual stories - both of which were amicably resolved, and one of which lead to the publication of the revised guidelines. And, inevitably, there have been other stories which have not produced complaints - but with which St James's Palace have had informally and privately to deal. But the broad picture has been one of commendable restraint - especially on the use of photographs, and on the issue of physical harassment. And we have had other hiccups in more recent days. The last fortnight has sadly been marked by a number of controversies relating to the copyrighting and publication of photographs to coincide with Prince William's 18th birthday. Indeed, it was that controversy which caused me to postpone this speech - which I had intended to deliver a fortnight ago. Given that my message today is one of great praise for editors, and for the co-operation that has taken place for most of the last five years, this is not the time or the place for a post mortem on these recent events and I do not intend to deliver one. However, I have to underline one point. Given that the future protection of Prince William's privacy is going to rely to some extent on continued co-operation between Palace and press, I have been monitoring the events of recent weeks with some care - and discussed with St James's Palace the lessons to be learned from them. I am satisfied from those discussions that the lessons have indeed been learned - and that the Palace is now in a position to be able to deliver the co-operation that is required to make this work. Photographs First, then, photographs. The question of what photographs of Prince William will be published is, in many ways, the most important one for editors and for the readers of newspapers. Over the last few years, relatively few photographs of Prince William - or, indeed, of Prince Harry - have been published because of the tight restrictions in the code. That prohibits photographs taken and published without the consent either of parents or of school authorities. From tomorrow, he will cease to benefit from that protection - and he can expect to be photographed in public places like any other young adult. If, therefore, he is playing polo, or shopping in Oxford Street, or sitting outside a pub, then he will from time to time be photographed and those pictures are likely to be published. That is likely to mean that newspaper readers are going to be seeing somewhat more of him in the future. There are, of course, caveats to that. The first is that neither I, nor the editors I have discussed this with, can foresee any circumstances in which it will be justifiable to publish pictures of Prince William that have been obtained as a result of intimidation or harassment or persistent pursuit - points I want to talk further about at the end of my remarks. The second is that - like every other public figure - there should be no publication of snatched pictures of Prince William taken when he is in a private place, that is somewhere where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. I have made clear to editors, who agree with me, that they should generally regard pictures of him in private gardens, in restaurants and so on as off limits under the code, except - of course - on those rare occasions when there may be a public interest in doing so. In other words, there is going to be an important change in this area -bearing in mind the key caveats that I have also made. Facts Another area where there is going to be further change is that there will inevitably be more stories written about Prince William. Again, the code - with its provision that young people should be able to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion - has meant that hardly any stories about Prince William during his time at Eton have appeared, and rightly so. It has had the same success as far as other young people are concerned. But as he becomes, increasingly, a public figures and is away from his school environment, there are going to be more stories written about what he gets up to in public. As there are likely to be more stories, I think it sensible simply to underline a number of points about factual accuracy. I think most people in public life grudgingly accept the fact that sometimes things get written about them which are unfair, misleading or downright wrong. Certainly, I can think of a number of things that have been written about me which bear not even a passing resemblance to the truth. But it happens, usually by accident. If it is a point of no consequence, most of us let it pass. If it is a serious matter, I always encourage people to take it up with the editors - and, if that fails, take it to the PCC. Most significant inaccuracies are quickly put right that way. However, while older members of the royal family may themselves from time to time attract a degree of speculation and conjecture in stories about them, a public figure like Prince William who is also a very young man should be entitled to expect that things that are written about him are accurate. He should not have to read about how he is part of a so-called 'set' that is involved with drugs - when he has never been part of that 'set'. He should not have to read about family arguments that he is purported to have had when he hasn't had them. He should not have to read about how he is having a relationship with a girl that he has never met. Such inaccuracies are in many ways worse than an intrusion into privacy because they create a misleading impression, and - as the old saying goes - mud sticks. In some cases, particularly where other individuals are involved, it can damage more than one person. To give you an example, in recent weeks the PCC has been involved both formally and informally with investigations relating to two or three newspapers that have run stories about alleged relationships of Prince William. What has struck me during all these is the potential damage that can be done to the girls concerned, and the embarrassment they may well be caused - let alone how such stories affect Prince William. In each case, the PCC has reminded editors of the importance of accuracy in these matters, and I take the opportunity to do so again today. In other words, where newspapers or magazines are writing about Prince William they must take care under the code to ensure the stories are right - which will usually mean not relying simply on the word of those who may well turn out to be troublemakers. Indeed, I was struck recently by a very salient point made to me - that real friends of Prince William will not be seeking to cause mischief by leaking stories to newspapers. Those who do may not turn out to know him quite as well as they pretend - landing editors in trouble as a result. This, in turn, also puts an onus on St James's Palace to ensure that they respond constructively to legitimate inquiries about stories relating to Prince William. Privacy Let me turn next to the perennially contentious area of privacy - first of all by reminding you what the code, written by editors themselves, actually says. Clause three of the code of practice makes clear that everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private life. That part of the code - drawn from the European Convention on Human Rights - is quite clear. Everyone means everyone. As we recently pointed out in an adjudication on a complaint from Ian Brady, even serial killers are entitled to their privacy. It is unthinkable that the second in line to the throne should not be treated to the same respect. But at the same time, we have to recognise - as, indeed, I made clear in my remarks five years ago - that he is different to other people simply because of his position. That means there will be legitimate public interest in stories about him and pictures of him - but not on the basis of a 'free-for-all'. I think at this point, we have to be as clear as we can be about what we mean by 'private life' - because, with people in the public eye, the boundary between what is private and what is public is sometimes indistinct. There are a number of firm pointers in the code itself as to what constitutes a person's private life. It includes someone's: \u0095 Family life (although recognising that other members of his family are, of course, public figures themselves) \u0095 Health \u0095 Personal correspondence \u0095 Telephone conversations \u0095 Space at times of grief and shock \u0095 And (as I made clear earlier) pictures taken in private places. It also includes a degree of special protection from physical intrusion when someone is in hospital. That is a carefully delineated area that I think - and editors agree - should generally be regarded as off limits under the code, unless, of course, they are writing about aspects of any of these where there is public interest involved. I can easily see, for instance, occasions on which a report about the Prince's health may well be in the public interest - and the code, of course, allows for that. Beyond those categories, newspaper editors will exercise their usual judgment on what constitutes someone's private life - but it does mean that there are therefore going to be significant areas of his life that can be reported. This might well include, for instance, reports about a job he undertakes in his gap year, or reports of a drama production or a charity event he participates in at university and so on - in other words, things that are not inherently part of someone's private life. Inevitably, the question will be asked - indeed, I seem to have been answering it for many years - about how newspapers should deal with stories which some might consider to be of a romantic nature. First things, first: As I said earlier, they should make sure under the code that they are accurate before they even consider the privacy aspects of the case. I know of three cases in the last two years where - naming no names - three different newspapers have linked Prince William romantically to three different girls. In two cases, he had never met them; in one case, he had met the girl once. Such fundamental inaccuracies are unacceptable - and are damaging, quite apart from anything else, to the poor girls in question, who may or may not already have relationships of their own. I would also add one point here that it can't be acceptable for any newspaper or magazine to deduce a 'relationship' solely from the fact of his being seen on his own with a girl in public. I think we all know the difference between 'friendship' and 'relationship' - and it would be unfair for any newspaper report to deduce one from the other without other supporting evidence. That said, if a story is accurate, then a newspaper should consider - as in any case relating to personal privacy - whether there is either consent, or the material is in the public domain, or there is sufficient and genuine public interest under the code. If none of those factors is present, I would hope any editor would think quite carefully before printing such a story. It is important to remember this: The code says that everyone is entitled to respect for their private life. As far as young people are concerned privacy means, probably more than anything else, that they must have the right to grow up and form relationships without having to read about them week in and week out in the newspapers, or hear about them on the radio and television. Before anyone suggests otherwise, I am a realist. I do not believe it possible or desirable to prohibit newspapers entirely from speculation and reports about young ladies that might eventually become a more permanent feature of his life. But I would say this: endless intrusion of the sort we have not seen for five years and the constant, powerful headlamps of unwarranted publicity would make his life a misery, make his friends' lives a misery and make it much more difficult for him to forge proper and meaningful relationships. So, newspapers must continue to exercise restraint - as they have done in the past. They must continue to check their facts. And they must continue to think about the impact on Prince William of either inaccurate or intrusive stories on this particular subject. I am realist - but this is a very important issue which the PCC will be following closely. And it is one where, I suspect, the public will have strong views as well. Physical intrusion Finally - and this is in many ways the most important part of what I have to say and is certainly a subject on which editors have indicated to me that they also feel very strongly - I would like to highlight the terms of clause four of the code, which deals with harassment. While Prince William has been at school, the code has been very clear on the issue of photography and physical intrusion. Now that those specific provisions no longer apply to him, I have to say that the code is no less clear on the general issue of harassment, which means: \u0095 No persistent pursuit \u0095 No physical intimidation \u0095 And (as I made clear earlier) no photography in private places. In other words, it would be quite unacceptable for paparazzi photographers to pursue Prince William around whichever university he attends - and quite unacceptable for newspapers to publish photographs which have been obtained in this manner. Indeed, no editor that I have spoken to would dream of doing so. The ability of all young people to go about their normal lives without physical intimidation is hugely important. The absence of paparazzi at Eton during these last five years has been a significant success - and a tribute to all editors who have made clear to photographers that there is no market for intrusive pictures. Prince William's 18th birthday is not an invitation for them to return. The PCC will come down hard on the publication of any pictures of Prince William that has been obtained through intimidation or persistent pursuit - just as we would for any other individual. The need for continuing co-operation Those, then, are the key issues I want to highlight today. What we are saying, simply, is that Prince William should continue to be allowed a private life and freedom from harassment in the same way as any other public figure. That is something that will be made much easier - I have no doubt - if there is continuing co-operation between the press and St James's Palace to ensure both that the public sees and reads about Prince William's progress to and through university, and that what is written about him is accurate. Following my intensive discussions with them, I can confirm that the palace fully understands that point - and has made clear that, during his gap year and then during his time at University, regular facilities for the media will be made available to record his progress and continuing education. That way, I am confident that - even though times are changing - the successful balance we have achieved over the last five years can be maintained during the time in which Prince William completes his education. There will be four winners from that. One winner will, of course, be Prince William - who will continue to benefit from the protection of the editors' code and therefore be able to complete his education without unnecessary intrusion. One will be newspapers and magazines - because by continuing to respect his privacy, they will again be demonstrating to the public that the media can act responsibly and sensitively and that self-regulation really works. One will be the public - which has consistently made clear, as the results of an opinion poll last week underlined, that they want to see Prince William grow up with as much privacy as possible. And the final one will be the institution of the monarchy itself. I have always believed that - after many years in which the relationship between press and palaces was fraught and tense - the way that newspapers have respected the privacy of Prince William and Prince Harry has pointed a new, better way forward for the next generation. From that the monarchy itself is bound to benefit.",

I've got huge admiration for people like Posh and Becks, but we need to add to the list people at the sharp end of academic achievement. There are countless candidates, though only a few household names, such as Stephen Hawking. We live in the age of the instant, so I don't think this is a change that could happen overnight. We have to work at it. But it could do so much: when you show young people it's cool to be clever, they take to learning like ducks to water.

If she were a man, she could try the YMCA's Lads and Dads course, aimed at helping fathers to communicate with sons.

If she lived in Great Yarmouth, she could approach the Women's Group, which runs facilitated groups for parents. And if lucky enough to live in Northern Ireland, she could call SpeakEasy, a project run by the Family Planning Clinic (FPC), which offers a three-day residential course to discuss concerns with other parents and a qualified facilitator.

In any case, Greg would be wary of me suddenly becoming interested in his puberty issues.\" </p> <p>Dr Miriam Stoppard, author of several books on sex education, believes the biggest mistake \"suddenly clued-up parents\" make is going too abruptly into discussions of sex. \"The only way sex education within the family really works is to talk about it from the moment the child is born,\" she says. \"Equally important is picking the right time - meaning their 'ready time' not yours.\" </p> <p>Kerry McCall, a 40-year-old mother of five, knows exactly what she means.

When the baby is newborn, it is a shorthand for, \"Is he healthy?\" And unlike the others, this question will be asked not once, but a hundred times: by mothers themselves when they visit the clinic, by health visitors clutching graphs, by mothers-in-law who don't think breastfeeding is a good idea. </p> <p>So when Lewis Baum's weight failed to climb the scales, his mother Joanne felt she had failed, unable to confirm her care through those pounds and ounces. Attempts to wean her son onto solids when he was six months old became the first battle in the war that was to follow. Lewis gagged on food Joanne had made but would happily eat the jarred variety. </p> <p>Aged one, he wouldn't eat anything but jarred food and although his weight wasn't falling his parents became increasingly anxious. \"I ended up in tears every time I tried to feed him,\" Baum says. </p> <p>Joanne was referred to Feeding Matters, one of two projects run by the Children's Society, which help parents reach a truce at the dinner table. A project worker visited them at home and filmed Joanne's desperate attempts to get him to eat. By going through the film, the project worker was able to help Joanne understand what was going wrong - and to discover ways that she could break the deadlock. </p> <p>Lewis's case was a mild one. As many as one in 20 under fives in Britain are said to be suffering from \"faltering growth\" (aka \"failure to thrive\") because they are not receiving enough calories. Contrary to previously held perceptions that it was confined to the poorest and most negligent families, research has shown that it can occur in any home. Faltering growth is neither a disease nor the same as faddy eating. The precise cause is unknown, but only 5% of young children with inexplicable poor growth are found to have an illness, and only a minority have faltering growth because of abuse or neglect. </p> <p>What is clear however, is that parents of children with faltering growth suffer a destructive cycle of self-blame. A report out today from the Children's Society found that these parents feel helpless, unsupported and deeply distressed by the impact the condition has on their baby. They describe how their child refused to eat, which included screaming, crying, clamping their lips together, turning their heads away, pushing the food away, spitting out food and being sick. These confrontations at meal times, the report suggest, are part of a vicious circle: parental anxiety about a child's rejection of food is detected by the child which then compounds the problem. </p> <p>\"There is often no one cause,\" says Angela Underdown, author of the report and a social policy officer at the Children's Society. \"There are often many, many causes and focusing on one makes the tension worse.\" </p> <p>Underdown says babies \"tell\" their parents if they want to eat and when they've had enough. Parent's descriptions of mealtimes indicate that they might have become \"out of tune\" with their baby's non-verbal cues so that feeding becomes fraught. \"It's important that parents listen to their child's body language,\" she suggests. </p> <p>But how can parents identify what they are doing wrong? Deborah O'Dell banged on every door she could find to find out why her daughter Rebecca had faltering growth. From the moment she came home from hospital she was refusing milk. She dropped below her birth weight. At three months she was tested for diabetes, leukemia and cystic fibrosis - all of which she did not have. At seven months, a tube was inserted into her stomach through which she was fed artificially. Aged one, she weighed only 14lbs: an average body weight of a six- to nine-month-old baby. </p> <p>During that time O'Dell had made numerous trips to her GP, and was even referred to Great Ormond Street hospital in London, but the problem continued. Then she read about Feeding Matters in a newspaper and asked them for help. </p> <p>It was only when O'Dell saw on film how she and her husband were interacting with Rebecca that she began to understand what had been going wrong. \"On the video, we're saying 'do you want this Becky? Becky do you want that?' We were obsessed with her eating,\" O'Dell says. \"We saw how we were making things worse, bribing her and forcing her behaviour.\" </p> <p>In tandem with regular visits by the project worker, a diet plan, working agreement and regular reviews, Rebecca is beginning to eat more. \"We now ignore Rebecca when she doesn't eat and praise her when she does. If she doesn't eat we talk to each other and she gets bored and starts to eat. Our lives are completely different.\" </p> <p>Taking pressure off a child to eat is the first step towards solving faltering growth argues Sue Barber, a Feeding Matters practioner in North Tees. \"If you give a lot of attention to behaviour you don't want it tends to encourage it,\" she says. \"If mealtimes become a battle the parent will always loose.\" </p> <p> For a parent to deal with their child's refusal to eat they must first learn not to take it personally. \"Just acting as if you don't care is not good enough. You have to mean it,\" says Julia Fabricius, director of the Anna Freud Centre which tackles childhood emotional disorder. Fabricius argues that, along with potty-training and dressing, eating is a common battleground because it marks a child's assertion of will. </p> <p>\"Toddlerhood is the very moment when a child battles for autonomy,\" she says. \"For many children their first word is 'no'. They are trying to be their own person.\" </p> <p>It was only when Joanne Baum stopped insisting that Lewis eat, that he did. After watching what was going wrong on video and advice from a Feeding Matters worker, two-year-old Lewis is eating more. \"When I was reassured that he was getting a balanced diet, despite his lack of enthusiasm for food, I relaxed,\" Baum says. \"I'm not forcing anything down him and mealtimes are beginning to be a pleasure.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Parents concerned about their child's eating should first contact their health visitor.

As a child, Jung concluded that Jesus and the phallus were, in fact, the same thing. The conflation is persuasive where Chris is concerned: he thinks he is God's gift and I think he's a prick. </p> <p>His effect on Dilys, though, has been quite different: he swept her away to his terracotta cave where he got in touch with his masculine side, and she started baking her own bread. And the children? I looked after them most of the time. At least, I did until Dilys got round to re-asserting the privileges of motherhood and promoting the paternal claims of Chris, \"our other dad\" as my children are encouraged to describe him. Ha, bloody, ha. </p> <p>By then Gloria, Jed and Billy had started living part-time lives: half their time in my house, the other half with those I dubbed \"The Enemy Without\".

At the centrepiece of our proposals lies the replacement of unnecessary prison sentences with community supervision programmes based on evidence of what works in reducing offending. This would enable the prison service to provide humane, constructive regimes for a more manageable number of prisoners.\" </p> <p>The manifesto is bound to prove influential. Hurd, president of the Prison Reform Trust, recently warned Tory leader William Hague not to regard prisons as \"simply wastepaper baskets into which we can toss those of our fellow citizens about whom we wish to hear nothing further\". </p> <p>\u0095 A Joint Manifesto for Penal Reform 2000 is available from the Penal Affairs Consortium, 169 Clapham Manor Road, London SW9 0PU.</p>",

Cedric Fulwood, chairman of the Penal Affairs Consortium, says: \"We believe that our proposals provide a blueprint for a penal system which is more effective in cutting crime, rehabilitating offenders and reducing the distress of victims. At the centrepiece of our proposals lies the replacement of unnecessary prison sentences with community supervision programmes based on evidence of what works in reducing offending. This would enable the prison service to provide humane, constructive regimes for a more manageable number of prisoners.\" The manifesto is bound to prove influential. Hurd, president of the Prison Reform Trust, recently warned Tory leader William Hague not to regard prisons as \"simply wastepaper baskets into which we can toss those of our fellow citizens about whom we wish to hear nothing further\". \u0095 A Joint Manifesto for Penal Reform 2000 is available from the Penal Affairs Consortium, 169 Clapham Manor Road, London SW9 0PU.",

Had she eaten? Had she fallen? These were impossible questions for her to answer. But she was, to all intents and purposes, lucid and reasonably mobile. </p> <p>The social worker had doubts about home care but there seemed to be no problem about a residential option. I drove the requisite 400 miles and visited possible residential homes, all of which had vacancies. </p> <p>The first showed me a nice room with a toilet and a less nice room without. It was entirely unclear to me which one was on offer and the discussion about money was, to say the least, opaque. The second was more straightforward. My mother was coming in \"through social services\", so I was shown a room without a toilet. </p> <p>I finally worked out that I had to say, although my mother has essentially nothing in the bank, she did own her own home. Rooms with toilets were then the order of the day. And what would happen when she has spent all the money from her house (still not actually sold and not likely to raise a great deal)? Well, I was told it was \"unlikely\" she would be bumped down to an inferior room. </p> <p>Since my mother moved into a residential home, I have filled in the form for attendance allowance - twice. The social worker was very helpful, but told me that she was not allowed to assist me with the form. But unless one has been co-resident with the person in need of assistance, it is virtually impossible to do. I have also completed income support forms. I have dealt, at length, with the court of protection. In short, I have devoted on average five hours a week to \"mother administration\". </p> <p>Different bits of money are being paid by different parts of the social security administration into three different accounts. It seems impossible to rationalise these. I have been told by the extraordinarily nice staff in the residential home how much I must pay out of my mother's \"house fund\" to meet the balance of their charges (\u00a3278 a week). However, recently she needed a new skirt. Somehow, she had managed to live in her own home on an income just below income support levels and had paid for new clothes. It is now impossible. From all her various bits of income from the state, she is allowed to keep a derisory \u00a315.45 a week. </p> <p><strong> Ruth Lister: the urban community care tale</strong><br> </p> <p> The inner-city tale started at Christmas itself. It illustrates both the strengths and weaknesses of the community care system. I found my mother, in effect, unable to control the lower half of her body - which meant very limited mobility, a tendency to fall and double incontinence. The result, it turned out, of a minor stroke. </p> <p>Once Christmas was over, the health and social services systems swung into action with impressive speed and co-ordination, even though it was still officially a public holiday. The rapid response team set up an interim service to help my mother get up in the morning and go to bed at night. The following day, a full care assessment was made. The care manager was extremely helpful and, unlike in the shire county, she saw the arduous task of completing the attendance allowance form as part of her job. </p> <p>The operation of the quasi-market in domiciliary care was, though, much less satisfactory.

Sometimes they were there for only a few minutes; once they didn't turn up at all.

      "body": "<p><strong> Street facades</strong><br> </p> <p> Your article on community participation in local government in Brazil (Streets Ahead, June 21) made heartening reading. However, we have a cautionary tale where consultation has been used as a rhetorical cloak to disguise old fashioned \"council knows best\" attitudes. </p> <p>There has been concerted public opposition to the siting of a Sainsbury superstore on a massive regeneration site in Brighton. Two previous superstore applications had been rejected before a public inquiry also found against the proposal. Since then, packed public meetings and local petitions have continued to oppose the development. The council then embarked on \"consultation\" by funding a three-day planning event, attended by 500 people. </p> <p>Yet again, there was near unanimity against a superstore. Councillors then decided to develop a planning brief by setting up a \"consultative\" working group in which they decided who should participate, the terms of reference, the final report and even whether dissent could be recorded. A council brief in support of the controversial store has duly emerged. </p> <p>The council has used the facade of consultation to ignore the consistent demand of the public opinion it expressly sought. Perverse outcomes like these undermine public faith in \"consultations\" and expose community participation in local democracy as a hollow sham. Unlike Brazil,it is the council which calls the shots here. <br><strong>Mike Aiken</strong><br> Brighton Urban Design and Development, Brighton</p> <p><strong> Sold short by Mencap</strong><br> </p> <p> Just as a pimp advertises a prostitute with references to willingness, capability and a favourable lasting impression, so we have the charity Mencap helping sell workers with learning difficulties to businesses by pointing out how they take \"fewer days off sick\", are \"more reliable\" and provide a \"positive impact on a company's image\" (Stack of Ability, June 21). </p> <p>And did I actually read the Mencap campaigns officer, Tom Berry, enthusing how \"people with learning disabilities are happy to do repetitive jobs that other members of the workforce wouldn't do\", can be \"very productive\" and businesses are hence \"generally very pleased with what they get for their money\"? </p> <p>It is one thing to provide enjoyable work for disabled people, but totally another to endeavour to have them profitably exploited through dead-end, monotonous labour and crafty, consumer-friendly advertising. <br><strong> Max Hess</strong><br> Folkestone, Kent </p> <p>I agree that many day centres do little except contain people with learning disabilities with an endless round of tea and toileting. However, I am surprised that a spokesperson for Mencap is still reinforcing stereotypes about people with learning disabilities' desire for the monotony of repetitive and, as it seems in this case, potentially exploitative, low-paid employment. </p> <p>It is clear from the tone of the article that the emphasis is too far towards productivity, benefits to business, raised profiles and profit.

      "bodyText": "Street facades Your article on community participation in local government in Brazil (Streets Ahead, June 21) made heartening reading. However, we have a cautionary tale where consultation has been used as a rhetorical cloak to disguise old fashioned \"council knows best\" attitudes. There has been concerted public opposition to the siting of a Sainsbury superstore on a massive regeneration site in Brighton. Two previous superstore applications had been rejected before a public inquiry also found against the proposal. Since then, packed public meetings and local petitions have continued to oppose the development. The council then embarked on \"consultation\" by funding a three-day planning event, attended by 500 people. Yet again, there was near unanimity against a superstore. Councillors then decided to develop a planning brief by setting up a \"consultative\" working group in which they decided who should participate, the terms of reference, the final report and even whether dissent could be recorded. A council brief in support of the controversial store has duly emerged. The council has used the facade of consultation to ignore the consistent demand of the public opinion it expressly sought. Perverse outcomes like these undermine public faith in \"consultations\" and expose community participation in local democracy as a hollow sham. Unlike Brazil,it is the council which calls the shots here. Mike Aiken Brighton Urban Design and Development, Brighton Sold short by Mencap Just as a pimp advertises a prostitute with references to willingness, capability and a favourable lasting impression, so we have the charity Mencap helping sell workers with learning difficulties to businesses by pointing out how they take \"fewer days off sick\", are \"more reliable\" and provide a \"positive impact on a company's image\" (Stack of Ability, June 21). And did I actually read the Mencap campaigns officer, Tom Berry, enthusing how \"people with learning disabilities are happy to do repetitive jobs that other members of the workforce wouldn't do\", can be \"very productive\" and businesses are hence \"generally very pleased with what they get for their money\"? It is one thing to provide enjoyable work for disabled people, but totally another to endeavour to have them profitably exploited through dead-end, monotonous labour and crafty, consumer-friendly advertising. Max Hess Folkestone, Kent I agree that many day centres do little except contain people with learning disabilities with an endless round of tea and toileting. However, I am surprised that a spokesperson for Mencap is still reinforcing stereotypes about people with learning disabilities' desire for the monotony of repetitive and, as it seems in this case, potentially exploitative, low-paid employment. It is clear from the tone of the article that the emphasis is too far towards productivity, benefits to business, raised profiles and profit. What about people? When will organisations purportedly supporting individuals with learning disabilities, and society at large, stop dealing in generalisations? People with learning disabilities are just people like the rest of us: individuals with personalities, skills, dreams and interests. No one would dream of saying that all women should be secretaries, that all black men should be bus drivers or all gay men should be hairdressers. It is time to stop trying to live the lives of people with learning disabilities for them, and to start to educate them by increasing our expectation of them from their early years. This will enable them to make their own choices and have opportunities for something more than stacking shelves. Simon O'Corra independent advocate, London No to NHS control It is hard to fathom the arrogance of the NHS Confederation - whatever this strange body may be - in suggesting (Solving Riddles, June 14) the commissioning of social services by an NHS which is castigated in the same issue of the Guardian (front page) for doctor's errors costing \u00a32bn a year. My blood runs cold at the thought of a service which is only just beginning to understand (let alone put into practice) the social model of disability, having control over anything relating to current provision by the social service and voluntary sectors. Years of careful work to reverse medical model nonsense will be damaged if the NHS is let anywhere near social services. The other way round makes much more sense; how about it?

This is MST, the Movement of Landless Rural Workers, Brazil's largest and most dynamic social movement, whose direct action tactics see them hoisting their red flag over farms, ranches, banks and government offices, demanding land, credits, schools, justice and a share of the wealth they help to create. </p> <p>For peasant movements and small farmers round the world who believe that agriculture is not just a question of trade, but a political and social issue, and that food sovereignty is more important than food security, the MST has become a reference point, superseding Cuba as a training ground for militants. Its links with like-minded groups now stretch to the Philippines, Thailand, Korea, China, Mexico, and throughout Asia. It is the most quoted group by political and environmental activists in Europe and America and is at the forefront of forging an ideol ogy for the poor in many countries. But what exactly is the Movimento Sem Terra? </p> <p>MST grew out of the despair of small farmers deprived of land in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul just 20 years ago and has spread to nearly all of Brazil's 27 states. Its red flag flies over hundreds of small rural settlements all over Brazil, pockets of defiance located in the heart of soybean country in the south, lost in the sea of sugar cane in the north-east, or in the midst of miles of cattle grass on the giant ranches in the Amazon basin. Pock ets of family agriculture in a sea of chemically-induced cash crops. </p> <p>Life in the settlements is hard, but it is still much better than it would be outside for the 600,000 families who live there. Before they joined the MST, most were illiterate rural labourers, poor small farmers, or unemployed shantytown dwellers. </p> <p>In the settlements, none more than 15 years old, they grow staples such as maize, beans, rice and mandioca (cassava), rear pigs and poultry, and keep milk cows. But they have also set up farm cooperatives to process milk, fruit, flour and other products for sale. They sell to commercial food companies, to farmers' markets, or through their first shop in S\u00e3o Paulo. </p> <p>Brazil is one of the world's biggest markets for pesticides and chemical fertilizers - Monsanto is building a huge factory there - and most of the settlements still use them, but an increasing number are going over to organic methods, encouraged by the agronomists trained by the MST. Initially, it was a question of cost: they could not afford the pesticides and fertilizers. But increasingly it is because of awareness about the damage caused by the chemicals and the advantages to health and the environment of green farming. </p> <p>An MST settlement in Baje now produces and markets organic seeds. In S\u00e3o Paulo, MST settlers are planting thousands of saplings produced by a local state forest reserve to counteract the erosion produced by the years of deforestation practised by the ranchers who illegally occupied the land before them. </p> <p>In the Amazon, where slash and burn agriculture is still the main method of small farmers, the Palmares settlement has begun replanting mahogany and native species such as the jaborandi. </p> <p>One of the biggest problems remains the government's failure to finance organic farming. Credits are for conventional farming only. MST demands to get funding, for long-term regional fruit production like the Amazon fruits cupuacu or graviola have so far been ignored. </p> <p>In the south, the MST has organised protests against the GM soya illegally planted by large farmers. The growing environmental awareness of the movement is fostered in the schools found in every settlement. In MST schools, the children are taught with the methods of Paulo Freire, Brazil's internationally-famed educationalist, who was exiled as a subversive by the military regime. </p> <p>They learn to ask questions. The education process begins in the temporary squatters' camps where families often spend years before winning their plot of land in a settlement. Here the school might be only a rustic shelter thatched with banana leaves and where the children sit on tree trunks. </p> <p>Many men and women, for whom Brazil's harshly unjust society had no other place than poverty and marginalisation, are now directors of farm or credit cooperatives, managers of meat packing plants, or schoolteachers, because of the MST. </p> <p>One of them is Jorge Neri, the illiterate son of a maid, now a member of MST's coordinating committee, who has just made a marathon tour of 10 European countries at the invitation of organisations eager to know more about the MST. On the way to meet him in London, I happened to be reading EP Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, and when we talked I was struck by the similarities between what happened 200 years ago here and what is happening now in Brazil, as Neri described what the MST see as the government's attempt to criminalise them. </p> <p>\"What we're doing is not new - we've been carrying out occupations for 15 years now,\" he says. \"We don't torture, or kill or kidnap. What worries the government is our capacity to organise nationally. They see the MST as a bad example to other social movements because we question government policy, we question the economic model, we propose alternatives. We want society to question the fact that they have no say in government spending, in how their money is spent.\" </p> <p>For Neri, it is the government which practises violence, because \"they are destroying labour rights, selling off nationalised industries, increasing poverty and unemployment. They want to isolate MST, not because we want land reform, but because it is showing society that it cannot remain quiet, it must react. We've waited 500 years already; we can't wait any longer. What is clear is that this model we have is no use - the country is poorer, there is less education, less health, the people see no future.\" </p> <p>The MST, together with other social movements, wants to organise a plebiscite on Brazil's staggering foreign debt, which is now over US$200bn, even though $125bn was repaid between 1995-98 - money that MST says could have gone on education, health and land reform. For Veja, Brazil's mass circulation news magazine, MST uses the pretext of agrarian reform to preach \"socialist revolution\". </p> <p>MST has discovered that direct action brings results - three-quarters of today's settlements originated as land occupations - but they are an unarmed movement, unlike the ranchers, hired guns and police who oppose them. The latest MST victim was a middle-aged father of five children, shot dead by police when they intercepted busloads of unarmed protesters near Curitiba in May. Their killers often go unpunished: four years after 19 MST protesters were shot dead in Eldorado do Carajas, 155 policemen accused of their murders still await trial. </p> <p> Jorge Neri found evidence during his trip to Europe that the Brazilian authorities have also launched a discreet battle to undermine overseas solidarity with the movement. Charities which fund MST activities, including some in the UK, are being warned by their governments that the MST is an organisation that resorts to illegal methods to secure land. </p> <p>For the Brazilian government, there is no need for the MST, because President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has already given land to more families - 370,000 - than any other government. MST claims that most of these families already occupied their land, that the government merely gave them titles. </p> <p>For Neri, there is a real danger that conservative forces in Brazil want to destroy the MST - and, besides violence, the weapon being used is an agricultural policy that favours the large agribusiness company, and has led to small farmers abandoning their land. Some MST leaders think MST settlements run as cooperatives could survive by becoming completely self-sufficient, and because they also have their own schools and, sometimes, pharmacies. Others are more pessimistic: they remember that in Brazil peasant movements have a history of being massacred. </p> <p>Neri is philosophic about the future: \"I think we're in for a struggle over a long period. It's not just a fight for land, but for a better form of democracy where people participate, debate, discuss what sort of policies they want. Maybe what we are proposing is an illusion?\"</p>",

On the way to meet him in London, I happened to be reading EP Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, and when we talked I was struck by the similarities between what happened 200 years ago here and what is happening now in Brazil, as Neri described what the MST see as the government's attempt to criminalise them. \"What we're doing is not new - we've been carrying out occupations for 15 years now,\" he says. \"We don't torture, or kill or kidnap. What worries the government is our capacity to organise nationally. They see the MST as a bad example to other social movements because we question government policy, we question the economic model, we propose alternatives. We want society to question the fact that they have no say in government spending, in how their money is spent.\" For Neri, it is the government which practises violence, because \"they are destroying labour rights, selling off nationalised industries, increasing poverty and unemployment. They want to isolate MST, not because we want land reform, but because it is showing society that it cannot remain quiet, it must react. We've waited 500 years already; we can't wait any longer. What is clear is that this model we have is no use - the country is poorer, there is less education, less health, the people see no future.\" The MST, together with other social movements, wants to organise a plebiscite on Brazil's staggering foreign debt, which is now over US$200bn, even though $125bn was repaid between 1995-98 - money that MST says could have gone on education, health and land reform. For Veja, Brazil's mass circulation news magazine, MST uses the pretext of agrarian reform to preach \"socialist revolution\". MST has discovered that direct action brings results - three-quarters of today's settlements originated as land occupations - but they are an unarmed movement, unlike the ranchers, hired guns and police who oppose them. The latest MST victim was a middle-aged father of five children, shot dead by police when they intercepted busloads of unarmed protesters near Curitiba in May. Their killers often go unpunished: four years after 19 MST protesters were shot dead in Eldorado do Carajas, 155 policemen accused of their murders still await trial. Jorge Neri found evidence during his trip to Europe that the Brazilian authorities have also launched a discreet battle to undermine overseas solidarity with the movement. Charities which fund MST activities, including some in the UK, are being warned by their governments that the MST is an organisation that resorts to illegal methods to secure land. For the Brazilian government, there is no need for the MST, because President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has already given land to more families - 370,000 - than any other government. MST claims that most of these families already occupied their land, that the government merely gave them titles. For Neri, there is a real danger that conservative forces in Brazil want to destroy the MST - and, besides violence, the weapon being used is an agricultural policy that favours the large agribusiness company, and has led to small farmers abandoning their land. Some MST leaders think MST settlements run as cooperatives could survive by becoming completely self-sufficient, and because they also have their own schools and, sometimes, pharmacies. Others are more pessimistic: they remember that in Brazil peasant movements have a history of being massacred. Neri is philosophic about the future: \"I think we're in for a struggle over a long period. It's not just a fight for land, but for a better form of democracy where people participate, debate, discuss what sort of policies they want. Maybe what we are proposing is an illusion?\"",

So outsiders, learning of his appointment, might be tempted to mutter: \"Buggins' turn.\" </p> <p>\"Absolutely, absolutely,\" Lishman accepts, disarmingly. Then why didn't he, a Manchester University graduate with an interest in politics and helping people, move on from the charity which he joined as a field officer? He might have been moving up the organisation's ladder, but he was also locked on to it. </p> <p>And while London beckoned, he could never afford, \"on the salary they were paying\", to move further south than Northampton, where he was stuck for several years. It was the late 1970s: his second marriage had broken up, he was a single dad bringing up two young children; coping with his duties as a Liberal on the local county council; and shuttling between scores of Age Concern branches - each with autonomy over local staff, services and funds. </p> <p>Just when he thought he couldn't run both sides of his life any longer, along came a solution: the charity agreed he should return to Lancashire, where he had relatives who would help with his childcare needs. </p> <p>It was an ideal arrangement. Back in the mill village where he had grown up, he bought a large terrace house and formed an extended family with his sister and her husband. \"We were, for a time, a three-parent, five-children family. By the time I remarried in 1998, with a new stepdaughter, it really wasn't right to uproot everybody and move down to London.\" </p> <p>Which brings us back to those two women. Greengross, director general since 1987, was an understanding boss who agreed that Lishman could continue to operate from Lancashire. And living close to his widowed mother - his father had been a rural GP - constantly reminded him of the timeless strengths of settled communities. </p> <p>There's a good Lancashire phrase, he says. \"Stop at home.\" As he applies it to older people, it's not just about enabling the frail to remain in their familiar, domestic surroundings. It's also about encouraging people to make clear what help and services they specifically need, and for councils and charities to provide them - not to impose others. </p> <p>\"Where I come from, and where I live, that's about being able to take down your net curtains so you can wash them, and give an image to the outer world. In my village, it's about putting Cardinal Red [polish] on the front step.\" </p> <p>Homely stuff, but don't write off Lishman just because he doesn't sound like a social policy guru. He knows that, to adapt Philip Larkin's line, some mill-town families are still cobble-close. It's first-hand social observation, sound enough to build policy on. </p> <p>Yet Lishman knows how to cite the right academic sources: a Maudsley hospital study, say, of depressed, homebound elderly people. \"Even one afternoon a fortnight of ordinary, basic, social contact - daycare at a not highly-organised level - helps them greatly. And the longest depressed benefited the most.\" </p> <p>But if anything, Age Concern stands accused of having too many policies; it's in danger, critics argue, of sinking under them. Lishman says he'll try to bring more focus. He can match any politician's rhetoric (he's a four-times-failed parliamentary candidate): about pensioner poverty; empowering the elderly; transport; reminding party bosses of the latent power of the grey vote. Sober-suited and stocky, he could easily pass as a Westminster mover and shaker. </p> <p>But the best aspect of Age Concern England's new boss is the sound common sense veined through his Lancastrian roots, of his belief in self-caring communities. He'll be back in his hamlet, Lane Bottom, again at the weekend. Briefcase full of position papers by staff in one hand, and a holdall with the week's dirty washing in the other.</p>",

And probably the best way to do that is through cognitive therapy, which is like having a very supportive friend help with problem solving at every stage of your life.\" </p> <p>Tasha's assessment of the value of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is borne out by recent research. One-to-one CBT has been shown to reduce the severity of symptoms including hearing voices, hallucinations, delusions and other thought disorders. It also cuts the relapse rate impressively - by up to 80% when families are involved. At least one European country, Finland, now routinely provides state-funded individual and family therapy for anyone with a severe mental illness. </p> <p>Yet in Britain, only two out of every 100 people with schizophrenia get the therapy, according to a report published tomorrow by the British Psychological Society. And political correctness is at least partly blamed for the situation - the b\u00eate noire being one of the most charismatic and controversial psychiatrists of the 20th century whose legacy, many believe, continues adversely to skew service provision. </p> <p>It's 40 years since the publication of RD Laing's book, The Divided Self, which launched the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s. Laing's startling vision was that of psychosis being rooted in experiences with others, most frequently in a family where relationship boundaries were blurred and messages confusing and contradictory. Falling ill was the first step towards recovery or, rather, a self-cure that acknowledged the \"mad\" person as an active agent in the creation and perpetuation of his or her own misery. Treatment, he said, should never be electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) or incarceration in a mental hospital, nor should it be drugs - at least of the prescription variety. </p> <p>Hailed as a guru of the sixties generation, Laing's message soon became brutally simplified to the callous phrase: families cause schizophrenia. </p> <p>\"After all these years, we still hear of parents being asked by their GP if they argue a lot or when they last had sex - at a time when they're seeking help, trying to cope with the fact that their child has been diagnosed with schizophrenia,\" says Marjorie Wallace, director of the schizophrenia charity Sane, set up 15 years ago at least partly to defend beleaguered relatives. \"They have this double burden of suddenly finding that someone they love has become strange and hostile, and then they're told it's all their fault.\" </p> <p>By the early 1990s, the influence of Sane and the promise of pharmaceutical therapies meant that Laing was widely seen as an irrelevance. Schizophrenia, said distinguished American psychotherapist Michael Robbins in 1993, \"is now generally believed to be an organic disease like diabetes or cancer and the psychotherapeutic models are looked on as relics of antiquity, even of the age of magic and witchcraft\". </p> <p>A few years on, however, the growing mound of evidence has brought at least a reluctant acknowledgement from most psychiatrists that family relationships, as well as genetics, play a role in schizophrenia. As media personality Raj Persaud, consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley hospital, south London, puts it: \"Schizophrenia is largely genetic - you have to have genetic predisposition in order to develop it. But if you grow up in a supportive family, it's entirely possible that events that precipitate the onset of schizophrenia may not occur.\" </p> <p>\"The truth,\" says Peter Kinderman, an academic clinical psychologist and one of the authors of tomorrow's report, Recent Advances in Understanding Mental Illness and Psychotic Experiences, \"is that genetic and biochemical research has hardly moved in the last 10 years, whereas there's growing evidence of the benefits of a psychological approach\". </p> <p>Whether or not difficult family relationships cause schizophrenia in some instances will never be known, he says. \"But what seems certain is that the family's attitude has a major impact on the recovery of a person with psychotic experiences. On the one hand, people may become critical or actively hostile to someone whose psychotic experiences are possibly embarrassing or disruptive. Or families may become emotionally over-involved, treating the ill person as if they were a child. Both attitudes are known to increase the risk of relapse.\" </p> <p>Kinderman, reader in clinical psychology at Liverpool university, says most relatives have stopped worrying about whether they are being blamed for their loved one's schizophrenia, all they want is to get the best possible treatment. \"In my experience, parents want their children with schizophrenia to receive cognitive behavioural therapy, and usually they'll say: 'Are there any ways in which we were responsible and if so, what can we do about it?'\" </p> <p>More surprisingly, Sane is now also campaigning for more family counselling. \"I've actually watched how families can cause a relapse because they know or fear that person is becoming ill and they get desperate and panic, and that's a recipe for disaster,\" says Wallace. </p> <p>So is it political correctness on the part of funding authorities that is preventing this proven, and apparently vital, service from becoming widely available? The real reason, argues Persaud, is that psychologists - just like Laing - don't really want to get involved. \"RD Laing chose not to become a consultant psychiatrist, seeing people with schizophrenia every day as I do. Instead, he set up in private practice in Wimpole Street, where there isn't a great deal of schizophrenia. It is a very difficult condition to treat and lots of psychologists today prefer to work with less challenging, middle-class angst rather than taking responsibility for unpredictable patients.\" </p> <p>Of the 2,000 clinical psychologists currently working in this country, Kinderman admits only a fraction are working in the field of schizophrenia. \"That number won't increase until psychiatry, as well as psychology, acknowledges the role of talking therapies in treating mental illness,\" he says. \"The training required is considerable and the NHS needs to acknowledge what research has already proven.\" </p> <p>\u047d Recent Advances in Understanding Mental Illness and Psychotic Experiences is available at \u00a315 from the British Psychological Society, St Andrews House, 48 Princess House East, Leicester LE1 7DR</p>",

      "bodyText": "Newspaper watchdog Lord Wakeham today called for continued restraint in coverage of Prince William after he leaves school. Setting out new guidelines for editors, the chairman of the press complaints commission (PCC) said the 18-year-old prince was entitled to privacy in the same way as any other public figure. On the potentially difficult issue of stories and pictures about William's future girlfriends, he warned editors that endless intrusion would make the prince's life a misery. \"Before anyone suggests otherwise, I am a realist,\" said Lord Wakeham. \"I do not believe it possible or desirable to prohibit newspapers entirely from speculation and reports about young ladies that might eventually become a more permanent feature of his life. \"But I would say this: endless intrusion of the sort we have not seen for five years and the constant, powerful headlamps of unwarranted publicity would make his life a misery, make his friends' lives a misery and make it much more difficult for him to forge proper and meaningful relationships. \"So newspapers must continue to exercise restraint - as they have done in the past. They must continue to check their facts. And they must continue to think about the impact on Prince William of either inaccurate or intrusive stories on this particular subject.\" In a speech delivered on Fleet Street, the former home of the national newspaper industry, Lord Wakeham called for continued cooperation between papers and St James's Palace as the Prince enters adulthood. William, who turned 18 last Wednesday, leaves Eton tomorrow at the end of his school career and after his A-level exams. He hopes to take a year out from full-time education before studying history of art at university. Until now, William has been protected from the full glare of the media spotlight as a minor at school. Under the newspaper industry's code of practice, William's privacy was protected in the same way as that of every other child. But it was accepted by the palace that there was a legitimate public interest in William as second in line to the throne. In return for media cooperation, the palace promised to make photographs and information about the teenage prince available at milestones during his childhood. With one or two exceptions, the strategy has been deemed a success by William's father, the Prince of Wales. William must absolutely not be \"fair game\" but, at the same time, \"things will change\", said Lord Wakeham. \"He has left school, he is growing up and has become a young adult, he is increasingly becoming a public figure - and the way the press covers him will reflect that.\" From tomorrow, William could expect to be photographed, like any other young adult, in public places - playing polo, shopping in Oxford Street or sitting outside a pub. \"That is likely to mean that newspaper readers are going to be seeing somewhat more of him in the future,\" said Lord Wakeham. But there should be no snatched pictures of William in a private place or place where there was a reasonable expectation of privacy, including private gardens and restaurants. Under the code of practice, these were off-limits to journalists except on \"rare occasions\" when there may be a \"public interest\" in publication. Lord Wakeham warned: \"The ability of all young people to go about their normal lives without physical intimidation is hugely important. \"The absence of paparazzi at Eton during these last five years had been a significant success - and a tribute to all editors who have made clear to photographers that there is no market for intrusive pictures. \"Prince William's 18th birthday is not an invitation for them to return. \"The PCC will come down hard on the publication of any picture of Prince William that has been obtained through intimidation or persistent pursuit - just as we would for any other individual.\" Lord Wakeham said William should simply be allowed a private life and freedom from harassment in the same way as any other public figure. \"That is something that will be made much easier - I have no doubt - if there is continuing cooperation between the press and St James's Palace to ensure both that the public sees and reads about Prince William's progress to and through university, and that what is written about him is accurate,\" he said. \"Following my intensive discussions with them, I can confirm that the palace fully understands that point - and has made clear that, during his gap year and then during his time at university, regular facilities for the media will be made available to record his progress and continuing education. \"That way, I am confident that - even though times are changing - the successful balance we have achieved over the last five years can be maintained during the time in which Prince William completes his education.\" Lord Wakeham told the Today programme that each case would have to be judged on its own. Asked whether the protection of the prince's privacy would include occasions when he might be seen with women in semi-public areas such as nightclubs, Lord Wakeham said: \"Editors have not been too bad so far. They use their judgment. They want their code to work and so do we.\" However, he said there had been some lapses over Prince William's schooldays: \"We have had stories of him having girlfriends when he has never met the girls. \"It is ridiculous.

Sometimes when he was at work on his poems, he declared radiantly, he was overcome by \"a sense of being self-prophetic master of the universe.\"</p> <p>That empowering sense, a feeling that he had a special mission, \"an immediate Messianic thing\" involving \"movements of history and breaking down the civilisation,\" had originated nearly two decades earlier, Ginsberg confided, in an auditory hallucination of William Blake intoning 'Ah, Sunflower' to him \"like God had a human voice'.\" James Campbell, who introduces a note of irony into his reworking of twice-told Beat tales, refers to Ginsberg's historic undergraduate illumination as \"hand-held\" - perhaps an allusion to a key detail in what he had said to me: the fact that an act of masturbation had triggered Blake's phantasmal arrival in his East Harlem tenement flat. This account of the revelatory plunge into Godhead (\"the ceremony of his election\"), often cited over the years as Beat Scripture, is quoted at length again here, ending with the poet's optimistic verdict as to its meaning for his future life: \"The spirit of the universe was what I was born to realise.\"</p> <p>Campbell's tour of Beat legend begins with his subjects' youthful exploration of criminal behaviour and moves on through many picaresque adventures, battles with psychic monsters, tiltings against windmills (normality is most often the enemy), pointless side-trips into illusory discoveries and confused rhizomatic intertanglings of relation and motive. He also shows how Ginsberg's quest led him back to the original Blakean delusion of grandeur. Throughout this underground romance, that first infusion of 'divine inspiration' remains for Ginsberg what opiates are for his fellow Beat quester, William Burroughs: a way of attaining to 'vision'. But Ginsberg's heroic mission includes something else as well: an implicit claim to the Beat throne. And more: \"I am high and naked,\" this indomitable Ecdysiac Knight exclaims, splashing into the 1960s on the last page of Campbell's hard-eyed reconstruction of the legend, \"and I am King of the Universe.\"</p> <p>When we met in England, Ginsberg had abdicated another impromptu throne, as King of the May (Kral Majales) in Prague. He had been expelled for taking off his clothes during a reading to his student subjects. Further prophetic challenges lay in store. We went on a pilgrimage to Glastonbury. There, after pausing under the great conical chimney of the abbey kitchen to scribble notes on the display of chivalric devices, arms and armour, he stood in the chilly drizzle over what was said to be the grave of King Arthur and chanted an extended, improvised rabbinical-druidic hymn. It evoked the strength and innocence of Blake's Albion and ended on what seemed to me, at the time, a strange remark, perhaps a challenge hurled from king to king: \"British poets are cowardly!\"</p> <p>Most legends have variants. The Arthurian story locates the mythic King's remains not at Glastonbury but in fabulous Avalon. Campbell puzzles out the meanings of legendary Beat episodes by offering alternative readings: providing, for example, ten different descriptions of the object that Burroughs was aiming at when he shot his wife in the head in Mexico (champagne glass, shot glass, highball glass, wine glass, gin glass, water glass, tin can, apple, apricot, grape), and six possibilities for the kind of paper on which Jack Kerouac typed out the original hundred-foot scroll of On the Road (teletype paper, Japanese drawing paper, oilskin art paper, shelf-paper, canister paper, tracing paper).</p> <p>He finds strands of Kerouac's road romance throughout the Beat legend. Tangled up in the story, as usual, is the Beat Lancelot, Neal Cassady. \"The new American hero . . . delinquent and hungry for a purpose\", Cassady shows up here in 1947, a beguiling apparition, naked with an erection in a tenement doorway, waiting to be \"miraculously-crafted\" into a figure of romance. For Kerouac, who had been blocking out a grand picaresque novel in his notebooks, an American Pilgrim's Progress, this naked stranger held \"the keys to America\", a kingdom whose magic had until this moment been withheld from him. Kerouac \"glimpsed the possibility of romance.\" There was \"something mystical . . . which, in a shaft of insight akin to a vision, he recognised in Cassady,\" Campbell writes. Kerouac's association with Cassady jump-starts what Campbell calls \"the process of a profound change in his attitude towards his own experience.\" The change was a matter of learning how to blow up real events and people to mythic proportions. It was Cassady who taught him this: the tearaway adventurer who stole cars and carried off women at a dizzying pace appeared to be more than human. The poetic tropes with which Kerouac limned his new-generation hero were often derived from classical mythology, with Cassady cast as a Promethean stealer of automotive fire, chained to his own inarticulate drives as one bound to a rock; a winged-messenger god in a Mercury; a naked Eros.</p> <p>In Campbell's account of the legend, the last of these figures is rampant. Cassady appears here under the double aspect of danger and desire. The importance of his role, allowing the spectator Kerouac to escape to the position of vicarious participant in his adventures, grows clearer as these adventures become more risky and the romance thickens, muddied by the growing extent of the depravity of the 'errant boy'. Inevitably, in this as in many other versions, we suspect that Cassady's place in the legend may be that of the sacrificial hero, the fated victim of his own terrifying quest for kicks. Being a witness to vision is less blinding than experiencing it, and Kerouac realises with relief that he will not have to put himself at the centre of his romance. Riding shotgun on great road trips will reveal his own ritual aspect, the Brooding Sidekick to Cassady's hyperactive, beguiling Knight Driven and Driver. Even before taking off, Kerouac is excited by a \"reflected witchery\" he feels sure will signal a new leap in his own vision-quest. \"And somewhere along the way,\" he writes at the start of On the Road, \"I knew there'd be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.\"</p> <p>Yet Cassady's reflected witchery turns out to be complex: the legendary cocksman is disclosed as an androgynous beguiler in a subplot that entangles him at once with Kerouac and Ginsberg. Campbell plays this as an episode of double desire, in which Lancelot becomes Guinevere. Balancing between \"the desire to please and the desire to profit\" by \"making an investment in Ginsberg's literary talent\", Cassady reveals his mendacious aspect as the Hustler Knight, \"only bestowing favours because he wants to gain something by the transaction.\" The 'investment' in physical attentions will return a certain dividend in Howl (\"N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver\"), but the real score is reserved for Kerouac. Campbell points to a passage in the 1950 scroll draft of the road romance, which left the Beat heroes' real names undisguised, and shows Kerouac seeking to appropriate the naked hero, now a bone of contention, for his own uses: \"Allen was queer . . . and Neal saw this and a former hustler himself . . . and wanting dearly to learn how to write poetry like Allen, the first thing he was attacking Allen with a great amorous soul such as only a conman can have.\"</p> <p>Campbell suggests that Kerouac's biased account of the three men's interlocking relations in On the Road is intended to point up the hollowness of the Hustler Knight's love for Ginsberg, and that this, in turn, \"creates a space for the true romance of the book\". He is particularly good on the way that \"true romance\" is clinched in the symbolic wedding scene. In this blushing, embarrassed bonding episode, which joins the narrator and his 'errant-boy' hero in a golden, illuminated moment on a sunlit hill, exchanging glances above the Western ocean, we are reminded again that in romance, accidents often turn up clues to the hidden intent of a quest. The scene is precipitated by a 'realistic' narrative contingency - the outlaw hero getting bounced (for infidelity) by his 'reigning wife' - but it allows a marvellous revelation of the secret goal. \"There were triumph and insolence in his eyes,\" Kerouac's narrator says, as the two heroes stand marooned in their Beatness on that sunlit hill, \"a devilish look, and he never took his eyes off mine for a long time. I looked back and blushed . . . we would stick together and be buddies till we died.\"</p> <p>Spelling out the significance of this for the legend, Campbell notes that \"theirs is a platonic love, though bedecked by romantic accoutrements, many of them subliminal, some even unconscious.\" His analysis of the symbolic 'wedding' is central to his account of Beat legend: the scene appears as the ultimate consummation of a sublimated 'boy-gang' love which has not yet adjusted to its later exchange value. The love between the two figures who, as Campbell comments, \"possess nothing but their baggage and each other\", is naive, deceived and self-deceiving, yet as long as the spell of the road romance lasts, it is untainted by the element of commodification which Cassady's hustler habits introduce into the legend. Had the road book stayed in Kerouac's backpack for ever, there might have been no cancelled cheques with his autograph for Johnny Depp to buy. But not all sacraments are destined to remain sacred.</p> <p>Given the current commercial success of everything to do with the Beats, it is ironic and curious to recall the resistance that Kerouac - the first, most committed and poetic of the Beat chroniclers - encountered when he began looking for a publisher for the 1950 typescript of On the Road. Campbell retells the story of this seven-year trial of rejection and suspicion, during which Kerouac's bitterness intensifies with the pitfalls and pratfalls of the quest, some of them bizarre, even grotesquely comic - Kerouac being ineptly agented by Ginsberg, and nightmarishly 'edited' by Carl Solomon, the insulin-comatose, glucose-swollen Bughouse Knight of Howl. Kerouac's comments in letters of the period paint an unfunny self-portrait of a gullible 'Li'l Abner' at the mercy of the rapacious commercial 'pigjaws' of Madison Avenue. There is also paranoia about having his creation whisked away, exploited and cashed in on by fellow writers. But paranoia, in his friend Burroughs's formulation, is only extreme consciousness: an enhanced receptivity to truth. It was around this point that John Clellon Holmes, a stay-at-home quester, purloined testimony from Kerouac and Ginsberg for a pelf-garnering pseudo-Beat romance (Go!), and, in a notorious article in the New York Times ('This Is the Beat Generation'), took metonymic possession of Kerouac's ritual term for the underworld heroes' \"new stance toward reality\" - \"a sort of furtiveness . . . a kind of beatness\", as Kerouac had explained it to him. \"I guess you could say we're a beat generation.\"</p> <p>Kerouac's belated effort to grab back the term's ritual magic by retitling his road-book The Beat Generation proved futile. The unparagraphed format of the 1950 hundred-foot scroll typescript clearly worked against its commercial prospects, and the recalcitrant Kerouac finally gave in and broke up the long heroic prose into more conventional units. A related but more serious difficulty was his disinclination to compromise the manner of his writing. On-the Road's headlong, scattered drafting of a collective but disorganised vision-quest, a romance of errantry with no point but the journey itself and \"no story beyond the story posted by the signs along the way\", inevitably set Kerouac at loggerheads with Malcolm Cowley, the first editor to recognise the mythic potential of his legend. Cowley, seen through the Brooding Knight's cocked eye as \"a semi-pedantic Vermont professor-type with a hearing aid\", made gentle but firm demands for a conventional structure - a \"unified story\", an 'A-B-C development' - which Kerouac stubbornly refused to accommodate. His book's construction, he insisted, was consistent with his road vision - a claim for the truth of allegorical romance. As Campbell says, this dispute agonisingly lingered; entire centrifugal movements were required to be cut; it was in desperation that Kerouac at last submitted to the sacrilege of revision which allowed On the Road to see the light.</p> <p>In This Is the Beat Generation, Campbell himself works with a romance-narrative mode of entrelacement; his reconstruction of Beat legend moves forward by jumping from limb to limb of a branch-narrative structure, following his several heroes' interconnected movements from chapter to chapter. Their quest is anti-normative, anti-conventional from the start. Like Malory's heroes, they are bound to a peculiar way of living, characterised by a restless search for new adventure. Malory's knights, after all, are not only courtly but crazy and confused; Caxton's preface warns readers that they will find not only deeds brave and chivalrous, but 'cowardyse, murdre, hate'. The young knights in search of a 'New Vision' whom Campbell discovers in wartime New York City - Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, Lucien Carr - all land in mental hospitals by the-age of 30. The loyal boy-gang that develops out of their errant undergraduate 'libertine circle' undergoes some of its severest tests in these early chapters, as their New Vision implicates them in a succession of legendary crimes of impulse, rehearsed by Campbell with something like tabloid relish. They include murder (Carr's \"honour slaying\" of his ex-scoutmaster, David Kammerer, with Burroughs and Kerouac as accessories); needle-drug addiction (\"quite a sensation\" is Burroughs's comment on being administered his first shot of morphine by Herbert Huncke); and self-mutilation (Burroughs's prescient deconstructive act, or \"Van Gogh kick\", of snipping off his left little finger with poultry shears).</p> <p>Irrationality is etched as deeply into Beat legend as the skull-and-crossbones Ginsberg inscribes beneath the words 'Fuck the Jews' in the dust of his college dormitory windowsill, earning him a brief expulsion from Columbia. The same sepulchral motif would come to figure as his calling-card. At King's College, Cambridge, in our 1965 spring tour, he scribbled it on a cheerful self-introductory note thrust under E.M. Forster's door. Forster later inquired: \"Is the fellow mad?\" When Ginsberg heard this, he thought it was flattering. In Howl, we recall, it is precisely the madness of the Beat generation's 'best minds' - \"starving hysterical naked\" - that leads them to vision.</p> <p>By the mid-1950s the Beat quest had carried its principal heroes to the fabulous western edge of the kingdom. In sunny California Allen Ginsberg's long camouflage trail of half-hearted 'normalcy programs' is finally lost in the hang-up-dispelling daylight of psychotherapy, allowing him to leap from a repressed state - \"the blind side of the trick wall\", Campbell calls it - out into the full illumination of his ceremonial aspect as the Ecdysiac Knight. To \"express secret life in whatever form it comes out,\" he confided to a group of students, \"I practically take my clothes off.\" At a famous gathering of minstrels in the Six Gallery, in San Francisco, Howl was covered with glory. For the first time in the Beat legend, private weirdness was publicly embraced.</p> <p>Kerouac the Brooding Knight succeeds less well in this West Coast phase of the legend. All along impatient with his \"flighty vagabond romanticism\", his latent racism and misogyny, Campbell now reveals him in his later Simple Simon aspect, as a faux-naif \"crazy dumbsaint\" Knight of Oblivion. The Kerouac of the later parts of Campbell's version is all but finished as a writer, even before his central work has been published: a foolish, besotted, lost hero \"to whom thoughts brought trouble, who drank to quell them\". Lonesome and bereft after the failed love affair with a black girl chronicled in The Subterraneans - condemned by Campbell as the most reprehensible of Beat texts - he turns to the Life of Buddha to relieve his 'Beermares', but after much untutored study rises only to the \"fatalistic and commonplace\" in his attempts to smuggle an adopted religion into his writing. </p> <p>Heading to California, he backpacks with Zen companions Philip Whalen and Gary Snyder, but only gets drunker and lonelier and unhappier. When last we see him, he is typing-up grandiose autodidactic meditation manuals and \"spiritual bromide\" sutras in a rustic cabin in thought-free California, victim of a fear of \"discriminating thinking\" that cloaks \"a banal fear of life\".</p> <p>The last word on Kerouacian/West Coast Beat Buddhism, here, is reserved for the exiled Invisible Knight, William Burroughs, responding from his 'end-of-the-world' outpost in Tangiers to his friend Kerouac's babblings about renunciation, self-abnegation and chastity: \"Buddhism is only for the West to study as history . . . It is not, for the West, An Answer, not A Solution. We must learn by acting, experiencing and living; that is, above all, by Love and by Suffering . . . You were given the power to love in order to use it, no matter what pain it may cause you. Buddhism frequently amounts to a form of psychic junk . . . What I mean is the Californian Buddhists are trying to sit on the sidelines and there are no sidelines. Whether you like it or not, you are committed to the human endeavour.\" The deadpan, laconic, no-nonsense noir voice of experience that makes Burroughs Campbell's true Beat oracle, at once its trustiest commentator and in some sense its stylistic model, also supplies some of the book's driest lines. Confronted by an 'Ugly Spirit' while shooting his wife in Mexico City, for instance, he reports that it was, in retrospect, as if her brain \"drew the bullet toward it\". Campbell, clearly impressed, places Burroughs among the \"untouchables\" of legend, those who perform a \"priestly function in taking on themselves all human vileness\".</p> <p>Our last glimpse of this frail, greyish creature of the shadows discovers him in Paris at the outset of the 1960s, the truest of Campbell's Beat survivors, still tuned into that old \"silent frequency of junk\" and still enacting the oldest and deepest of Beat rituals - transgression and self-mutilation - and turning them now against the legend itself. Taking a cut-up lance to his own writings as \"the next logical step in his continuing quest for the secret of telepathic communication\" - \"If you cut into the present, the future leaks out\" - the Invisible Knight finds the Word itself coming apart under his surgical blade. At the end of this demystifying book, Campbell stresses the fundamental difference between Burroughs's approach to the vision-quest and Ginsberg's. Burroughs wanted to eradicate his own identity; Ginsberg wanted to incorporate everything in his.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

They include murder (Carr's \"honour slaying\" of his ex-scoutmaster, David Kammerer, with Burroughs and Kerouac as accessories); needle-drug addiction (\"quite a sensation\" is Burroughs's comment on being administered his first shot of morphine by Herbert Huncke); and self-mutilation (Burroughs's prescient deconstructive act, or \"Van Gogh kick\", of snipping off his left little finger with poultry shears). Irrationality is etched as deeply into Beat legend as the skull-and-crossbones Ginsberg inscribes beneath the words 'Fuck the Jews' in the dust of his college dormitory windowsill, earning him a brief expulsion from Columbia. The same sepulchral motif would come to figure as his calling-card. At King's College, Cambridge, in our 1965 spring tour, he scribbled it on a cheerful self-introductory note thrust under E.M. Forster's door. Forster later inquired: \"Is the fellow mad?\" When Ginsberg heard this, he thought it was flattering. In Howl, we recall, it is precisely the madness of the Beat generation's 'best minds' - \"starving hysterical naked\" - that leads them to vision. By the mid-1950s the Beat quest had carried its principal heroes to the fabulous western edge of the kingdom. In sunny California Allen Ginsberg's long camouflage trail of half-hearted 'normalcy programs' is finally lost in the hang-up-dispelling daylight of psychotherapy, allowing him to leap from a repressed state - \"the blind side of the trick wall\", Campbell calls it - out into the full illumination of his ceremonial aspect as the Ecdysiac Knight. To \"express secret life in whatever form it comes out,\" he confided to a group of students, \"I practically take my clothes off.\" At a famous gathering of minstrels in the Six Gallery, in San Francisco, Howl was covered with glory. For the first time in the Beat legend, private weirdness was publicly embraced. Kerouac the Brooding Knight succeeds less well in this West Coast phase of the legend. All along impatient with his \"flighty vagabond romanticism\", his latent racism and misogyny, Campbell now reveals him in his later Simple Simon aspect, as a faux-naif \"crazy dumbsaint\" Knight of Oblivion. The Kerouac of the later parts of Campbell's version is all but finished as a writer, even before his central work has been published: a foolish, besotted, lost hero \"to whom thoughts brought trouble, who drank to quell them\". Lonesome and bereft after the failed love affair with a black girl chronicled in The Subterraneans - condemned by Campbell as the most reprehensible of Beat texts - he turns to the Life of Buddha to relieve his 'Beermares', but after much untutored study rises only to the \"fatalistic and commonplace\" in his attempts to smuggle an adopted religion into his writing. Heading to California, he backpacks with Zen companions Philip Whalen and Gary Snyder, but only gets drunker and lonelier and unhappier. When last we see him, he is typing-up grandiose autodidactic meditation manuals and \"spiritual bromide\" sutras in a rustic cabin in thought-free California, victim of a fear of \"discriminating thinking\" that cloaks \"a banal fear of life\". The last word on Kerouacian/West Coast Beat Buddhism, here, is reserved for the exiled Invisible Knight, William Burroughs, responding from his 'end-of-the-world' outpost in Tangiers to his friend Kerouac's babblings about renunciation, self-abnegation and chastity: \"Buddhism is only for the West to study as history . . . It is not, for the West, An Answer, not A Solution. We must learn by acting, experiencing and living; that is, above all, by Love and by Suffering . . . You were given the power to love in order to use it, no matter what pain it may cause you. Buddhism frequently amounts to a form of psychic junk . . . What I mean is the Californian Buddhists are trying to sit on the sidelines and there are no sidelines. Whether you like it or not, you are committed to the human endeavour.\" The deadpan, laconic, no-nonsense noir voice of experience that makes Burroughs Campbell's true Beat oracle, at once its trustiest commentator and in some sense its stylistic model, also supplies some of the book's driest lines. Confronted by an 'Ugly Spirit' while shooting his wife in Mexico City, for instance, he reports that it was, in retrospect, as if her brain \"drew the bullet toward it\". Campbell, clearly impressed, places Burroughs among the \"untouchables\" of legend, those who perform a \"priestly function in taking on themselves all human vileness\". Our last glimpse of this frail, greyish creature of the shadows discovers him in Paris at the outset of the 1960s, the truest of Campbell's Beat survivors, still tuned into that old \"silent frequency of junk\" and still enacting the oldest and deepest of Beat rituals - transgression and self-mutilation - and turning them now against the legend itself. Taking a cut-up lance to his own writings as \"the next logical step in his continuing quest for the secret of telepathic communication\" - \"If you cut into the present, the future leaks out\" - the Invisible Knight finds the Word itself coming apart under his surgical blade. At the end of this demystifying book, Campbell stresses the fundamental difference between Burroughs's approach to the vision-quest and Ginsberg's. Burroughs wanted to eradicate his own identity; Ginsberg wanted to incorporate everything in his. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

      "body": "<p> A few years ago the French director Jacques Rivette was one of several film-makers featured in a documentary made to commemorate the centenary of cinema. Each was asked why they made films, and nearly all attempted some grand statement about time, memory and the image. All except the famously reticent Rivette, who paused at length, shrugged and creased his face painfully into a sheepish \"Don't ask me\" grin. Similarly, if you asked me why I love Rivette's films, I'd probably have a go at the time-and-memory option but I'd be better off imitating the grin and advising you to go and see for yourself. Next week, his 1974 film C\u00e9line et Julie Vont En Bateau (C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating) is re-released at the ICA and it's a prime example of why Rivette's cinema is such an elusive, inexplicable pleasure. </p> <p>He has managed for years to be the most marginal of the original New Wave directors. In Britain, he means next to nothing - his last film, the austere Secret D\u00e9fense, was barely seen, while its predecessor, Haut Bas Fragile, a freewheeling, typically enigmatic musical, was never even released here. </p> <p>C\u00e9line and Julie was Rivette's one genuine cult hit, both here and in the US, where it sparked a remake of sorts in Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan. Rivette's film is in a different league from Seidelman's urbane romp - a three-hour tangle of dream, cloak-and-dagger intrigue and seemingly haphazard comedy that leaves you exhilarated, if not necessarily any the wiser. </p> <p>Opinions on it differ. David Thomson has called it \"the most innovative film since Citizen Kane\". Other people can't abide it. I know plenty who think it's just two whimsical hippie chicks arseing around. It's not a film that tries to please everyone, any more than its abrasively scatty heroines do. You either enjoy their obsessive goofing, or you may as well not bother. The point is that the film belongs as much to them and the actresses who play them as to Rivette. His work on the film, according to the late Juliet Berto (C\u00e9line), was a kind of \"surgery\", splicing and shaping the material that she generated with co-star Dominique Labourier. </p> <p>Here's a synopsis, not that it will really help. Julie is sitting in a Paris garden, brushing up on her spells, when C\u00e9line rushes by, leaving a trail of knick-knacks. Julie goes in pursuit, which becomes a sort of flirtation; the two become inseparable friends, if not lovers, then investigate a mysterious house in which a quartet of ghosts endlessly act out a stiff, disjointed melodrama. </p> <p>That's only part of it: there's C\u00e9line's slapdash magic act as La Mandragore, Julie's manic song-and-dance debut as La Kamikaze, a dead-of-night library raid with roller-skates and an extraordinary number of cats. There's also the way the film captures its time, not least in Berto's wardrobe - boas, bippety-boppety hats and all. </p> <p>Events seem to happen at random, as though they had been roughly spliced in someone's head. The impromptu feel comes partly from the fact that Rivette started the film when another project fell through; Berto and Labourier devised their own characters and an intrigue, while script collaborator Eduardo di Gregorio contrived the haunted-house business from two Henry James stories. But the overall film is shaped by Rivette's twin obsessions, film and theatre. The old house is like a deserted art cinema where the same faded old print is projected for ever. But what happens there is also a creaky stage melodrama that needs to be endlessly rehearsed until the spell is broken. The \"play\" finally becomes a Rosencrantz-and-Guildenstern routine, with C\u00e9line and Julie, in comic supporting roles, upstaging the principals. </p> <p>C\u00e9line and Julie is one of cinema's great stories about storytelling: despite appearances, the only scene that is improvised has the mythomaniac C\u00e9line driving her friends crazy with a tall tale. The whole film, in fact, is a shaggy-dog routine, spun out of old silent serials, comic strips and Lewis Carroll. Even Paris is unreal, despite the location shooting, which captures the feel of its deserted summer doldrums. </p> <p>Constantly re-running extracts from the haunted-house drama, C\u00e9line and Julie are like children watching the Tellytubbies and getting high on repetition. You can watch the film again! again! and always find something new. This week for the first time it occurred to me that this might be the only film in which the story is dreamed by a passing cat. </p> <p>\u0095 C\u00e9line and Julie Go Boating opens at the ICA, London SW1 (020-7930 3647) on July 7.</p>",

A report in the Mirror suggests that Portugal's three-goal striker wants to play in the Premiership, but that Villa will have to fight off rival bids from Fiorentina and Lazio. Luis Figo's wife has suggested he would not object to a move to London. \"Luis loves London and has been there many times\", she told Four Four Two magazine. \"It's the perfect place, there's nowhere better in the world.\" Bobby Robson will sign Portugese midfielder Marcelo Pereira Fernandez for Newcastle within the next few days, according to Teamtalk. The CS Maritimo player, known as Bruno, had been expected to move to Spain, but Bobby Robson's contacts in Portugal appear to have persuaded the player to move to England. Brazilian midfielder Edu claims he will be off to Highbury for a medical within 48 hours. \"I did not expect the deal to happen,\" the 22-year-old said. \"I've never played for the national team and I've only been in the Corinthians first team for four months.\" Arsenal cannot be certain of gaining a work permit for Edu, but manager Arsene Wenger believes he will be a good signing. \"Edu is a very talented player who can fit in most areas of midfield\", he told the Sun. David Pleat has confirmed that Spurs are interested in Schalke O4's Belgian striker Emile Mpenza. \"I can confirm that Mpenza is one of a number of young players that we are closely monitoring during Euro 2000\", he said. Mpenza scored one goal in a disappointing tournament for Belgium. Despite Bryan Robson's protestations to the contrary, the Mirror believes that German wing-back Christian Ziege has a clause in his contract that allows him to speak to any club that makes a bid of \u00a35m or more. Liverpool are set to make such an offer, the paper reports. Yesterday Robson told the press: \"There's not one player at this club who's got a clause that lets him out in any shape or form.\" Mark Draper is in talks with Southampton over a \u00a31.5m move to the South coast. Teamtalk believe a deal for the out-of-favour midfielder will be completed in days.",

      "bodyText": "France's clarion call for a \"pioneering group\" of EU member states puts new pressure on Tony Blair to accept the idea of a two-speed Europe in which Britain, especially a Britain outside the single currency, could find itself in the slow lane. Speaking on a state visit to Berlin yesterday, President Jacques Chirac went further than ever before in signalling France's desire for flexibility inside the EU, which some in Germany's leadership also want to allow integrationist-minded member states to strike out on their own. Defence and security policy, cooperation in the fight against crime and, most significantly, economic coordination, were all areas where Mr Chirac said a core group should be able to forge ahead. Britain is already a leader, together with France, on European defence. But its self-imposed exclusion from the euro-zone sets it apart in a key area. The French leader's call for an EU constitution will cause alarm in Britain, but more because it gives ammunition to Eurosceptics than because it poses an immediate practical problem. Drawing up a constitution for Europe is not on anyone's immediate agenda. It is not an issue for tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow. British officials believe that France and Germany have seized on flexibility as a way of reviving their recently wobbly axis, once the drive-shaft of European integration. Strikingly however, France has repeatedly made clear in recent days - as it prepares for the start of its six-month stint in the EU's rotating presidency on Saturday - that at the moment it wants to focus practically on a modest but difficult reform agenda. Between now and the Treaty of Nice, due to be completed by the end of the French term in December, the EU's 15 member states are supposed to agree on new national voting weights for group decisions, the number of commissioners they send to Brussels, and reducing the use of the veto in order to increase majority voting. All these changes are necessary to avoid institutional paralysis when the union expands. Up to 12 states are anxious to join after 2003. But the French president's focus on flexibility, or \"reinforced cooperation\", as Euro-jargon puts it, worries Britain - as well as sceptical Danes, Swedes and others. \"Those countries that want to proceed further with integration, on a voluntary basis and in specific areas, must be allowed to do so without being held back by those who, with every right, do not want to proceed as quickly,\" Mr Chirac told Germany's parliament, the Bundestag. \"Together with Germany and France, they could form a pioneering group,\" he suggested, citing the euro as one \"success\" already achieved by the 11 EU members who belong to the single currency; Greece is about to become the 12th. Britain agreed that reinforced cooperation could be on the agenda for the inter-governmental conference due to culminate at Nice. But Mr Blair is certain to insist on keeping the so-called emergency brake procedure - a restriction obtained by Britain in the 1997 Amsterdam treaty - though minor modifications are not ruled out. Foreign Office officials say they could accept that moves involving more pooling of national sovereignty would have in future to be blocked by two member states, instead of one as now. London's greatest and largely unspoken fear is that if closer cooperation is made any easier, the euro zone countries may move to harmonise taxation and budgetary policies, making a British decision on the single currency tougher than it already is. Flexibility cannot, by definition, apply to the EU's single market, arguably its most important practical achievement. Britain's public position is that it does not want to create a two-speed Europe at precisely the moment newcomers like Poland and Hungary are set to join. Faced with the mounting evidence of a big Franco-German-led push on flexibility, Mr Blair's strategy will be to press hard on enlargement and work closely with the Swedes, who take over the EU presidency in the first half of next year. He will also build on tactical alliances with Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Ireland on the structural economic reforms the EU so badly needs if it is to compete with the US. Last week's EU summit at Feira in Portugal saw Mr Blair forced on to the defensive about his intentions on the euro. And it was reported that he had been told by Mr Chirac and Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, that a two-speed Europe already existed, and Britain was definitely in the slow lane.",

Keegan \"did not know his best formation, yet alone his best team.\" He wanted to bring Steve McManaman into the side \"but could not find a way to do it successfully.\" He also arrived in Belgium without \"a decent left-back\" (that means you Phil Neville) while he \"continued to overlook Nigel Winterburn.\"</p> <p>The Euro is in full agreement with the bureaucrats of Nyon, especially when it comes to the veteran Arsenal full-back who has been ignored by England coaches for years.

They should be regarded as the favourites against France,\" French coach Roger Lemerre. Listen, this self-deprecating thing can go too far you know. THE EURO-TORIAL It must be a great job being a Uefa official. Swanning around all the most glamorous football matches, denouncing hooligans, inventing new formats for the Champions League - the fun never stops. So it's not surprising to find that the agents of European football's governing body have also taken to offering their advice to Kevin Keegan. According to reports, Uefa officials have published a report on every side knocked out of Euro 2000 and published them on their website (www.euro2000.org). Not that you can see them yet. In their assessment of England's performance, the unnamed assessors spare no blows. Or long words. \"For England the lessons of yesterday never seem to impact on the fevered anticipation of tomorrow\", Wilhelm Wordsworth writes, explaining that the expectations of supporters and media alike were too high. \"Unwisely,\" he/she continued, \"Kevin Keegan added to the delusion.\" Not only that, according to the report, M. Keegan \"did not know his best formation, yet alone his best team.\" He wanted to bring Steve McManaman into the side \"but could not find a way to do it successfully.\" He also arrived in Belgium without \"a decent left-back\" (that means you Phil Neville) while he \"continued to overlook Nigel Winterburn.\" The Euro is in full agreement with the bureaucrats of Nyon, especially when it comes to the veteran Arsenal full-back who has been ignored by England coaches for years. But if all their reports can tell us is what was perfectly obvious to everyone with a flickering TV screen, then perhaps Uefa should stick to canapes. TEL 'EM HOW YOU FEEL!

Offices in deprived urban areas will be offered help as part of a drive to expand services and keep the 18,500-strong network intact. The Post Office will be encouraged to continue with its strategy of offering financial services, including banking facilities. Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers is expected to announce the government's response to a report by the Cabinet office performance and innovation unit on the future of the service. Recent attention has focused on the threat to rural post offices, especially after 2003 when benefits will be paid directly into bank accounts, hitting around a third of post offices' business. But Mr Byers believes that offices in urban deprived areas face exactly the same problems. Subsidies are likely to be offered to keep post offices open and help improve services. Plans will also be published to make it harder for post offices to close. The Cabinet Office report is believed to find that the Post Office has been slow to modernise, and will be pressed to seize new business opportunities, such as e-commerce and handling mail order goods. Ministers will point out that around 2.5 million people do not have a bank account, so many of them could be offered the chance to pay bills or council taxes at their local post office.",

The television footage screened this week of books being delivered to Amazon was bogus; it will not be distributed to bookshops and warehouses until the day before publication. </p> <p>For months, the editor at Bloomsbury responsible for the book, Emma Matthewson, has had to keep its secrets to herself. The manuscript has been locked in a bank vault and even its title has been kept under wraps. It was called \"Potter Four\" in the trade - a suitably Hollywood-style title for the latest in a series that, in marketing clout at least, owes more to LA than Fitzrovia - and at least three plausible titles were in circulation. Bloomsbury finally confirmed yesterday that the book was to be called Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. </p> <p>The mixture of mega-hype and massive secrecy isn't just a marketing ploy - the publishing equivalent of the dance of the seven veils. Beneath the surface, it is possible to detect unease at Bloomsbury at the sheer scale of the success of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. \"I ask you please not to go into the money,\" said Bloomsbury's chairman, Nigel Newton, last week. Newton and other directors at Bloomsbury are said to have received begging letters following reports of the success of Potter and its impact on the company's share price. </p> <p>The first three Potter books have sold 35 million copies worldwide and rocketed Rowling into the earnings stratosphere. Last year, her income of \u00a314.5m put her third in the list of UK women earners, behind two businesswomen but well ahead of assorted Spice Girls. Her royalties were \u00a311.5m, advances \u00a32m, and the sales of film rights brought in another \u00a31m. </p> <p>She receives royalties of 15-20% - more generous than the norm - on the cover price of her books. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire will retail at \u00a314.99 in the UK, so Rowling will receive around \u00a34m from sales of the initial print run alone. Total UK sales of the first three books in the series stand at eight million, so further printings of The Goblet of Fire are highly likely. US sales of the first three books have been almost treble those of the UK (the US has accounted for 55% of global sales so far, the UK 20%), and Rowling can expect to net \u00a37m-plus from the first printing in the US. </p> <p>The rest of the world, though lagging behind the UK and US, is also beginning to catch the Potter bug. The books are available in 35 languages and the magic is especially potent in the vast markets of Japan and Germany, where it has topped the bestseller lists. Many countries are still catching up - most are on the second or third book, but China is only now about to publish the first - and The Goblet of Fire will initially only be published in the UK, US, Australia and Canada. But Rowling's agent, Christopher Little, says that the rest of the world is catching up fast, and that foreign-language editions will quickly start to account for a greater proportion of total sales. </p> <p>Rowling, who is 34 and lives discreetly with her young daughter in Edinburgh, has created a money-making machine, and the editors at Penguin, Transworld and HarperCollins who turned down the original manuscript must suffer torments whenever they survey the latest sales figures. Publication of the new Potter is sure to give a fresh impetus to sales of the previous three, and, when Warner Bros eventually takes Harry to Hollywood, Rowling stands to make even more on merchandising. (She recently applied to register her name and signature as trademarks.) Even before the film, the toy-maker Mattel is planning a range of action figures and games based on the books. </p> <p>\"Harry Potter has changed the lives of everyone associated with it,\" says Little. \"We thought it would do well, but we never imagined we would have a success on this scale.

Most of the shares are in the hands of blue-chip investment companies such as the Prudential, Mercury Asset Management, Morgan Grenfell and Legal &amp; General, but Newton himself retains almost 5% (currently worth more than \u00a36m, up fivefold from December 1998 when Pottermania was still in its infancy). </p> <p>Newton, who was born in California, is the son of a Financial Times journalist-turned-vineyard owner. He is 44, wears glasses and cardigans, and looks bookish, but he is seen within the industry as seriously entrepreneurial.

In an era of mega-publishing mergers, Newton has built up a respected house which authors tend to feel is not too big and impersonal. </p> <p>Potter is reckoned to account for more than 20% of Bloomsbury's turnover, and the attraction of such a big seller is that unit costs are kept down and profit per book maximised. Bloomsbury is likely to receive around 35% of the book's cover price, the retailer getting the remainder (though the latter's margins will be squeezed by discounting).

The legal battle is over,\" said the statement released by lawyer Gregory Craig.</p> <p>\"The family will now make immediate arrangements to return to their home,\" the statement added.</p> <p>A sniffer dog was seen checking the plane that would take the Gonzalez family back to Cuba and officials said they would be free to leave once they had gone through customs. The father was expected to make a short statement before their departure.</p> <p>The boy with the impish grin who survived a dramatic shipwreck that claimed his mother's life, shined a spotlight not only on US-Cuban tensions, but also on the rights of parents to make decisions for their children.</p> <p>The highest court in the land rejected without comment or dissent an emergency request by Elian's Miami relatives seeking to keep the boy in the United States and also turned down an appeal seeking a political asylum hearing for him.</p> <p>The court's action ended bitter legal wrangling over the child's fate in a politically charged case that began when he was rescued from the ocean off Florida last November after surviving a shipwreck in which his mother and 10 others died.</p> <p>Elian was reunited with his father on April 22 after armed federal agents seized him from his Miami relatives' home in a dramatic dawn raid in which the screaming child was seen being taken from the house.</p> <p>Hours later, happier pictures were released of Elian with his father, who had come from Cuba in early April to claim custody of his son from the Miami relatives, whom he accused of using the boy as a political tool against President Fidel Castro.</p> <p>Attorney General Janet Reno, who comes from Miami and took a special interest in the case, said she was pleased the Supreme Court had declined to review the Elian case. \"The law has provided a process, and this little boy now knows that he can remain with his father,\" Reno said in a statement.</p> <p>\"All involved have had an opportunity to make their case - all the way to the highest court in the land. I hope that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and join me in wishing this family, and this special little boy, well.\"</p> <p>Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez was gazing at the ocean behind a bayfront church in Miami when he received word that the Supreme Court had refused to consider the case.</p> <p>He turned angrily on a news crew trailing him, shouting at them to leave, while his daughter Marisleysis tugged at his arm and held him back. They and their lawyers planned a news conference later in the day.</p> <p>Asked to comment on the case, President Bill Clinton said if the father had decided to stay in the United States with Elian that would have been \"fine with him,\" adding he wished the case had unfolded in a less dramatic and traumatic way.</p> <p>In Cuba, Castro's government reacted to the court's announcement with a call to Cubans to maintain their \"serenity\" and \"discipline.\"</p> <p>Meticulous arrangements were being made for Elian's Cuban relatives to receive him at Havana's international airport in a low-key ceremony intended to preserve family privacy.</p> <p>The Miami relatives had looked after the boy since he was found by fishermen floating on an inner tube off the Florida coast on the U.S Thanksgiving holiday last November and launched a series of legal challenges to keep him in the United States.</p> <p>They said they wanted him to grow up in freedom in the United States and refused to send him back to live with his father under communist rule in Cuba. Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush voiced dismay about the Supreme Court's decision.</p> <p>\"I'm disappointed he is going back to Cuba,\" Bush said aboard his campaign plane in Cleveland. \"Hopefully he will go down to a Cuba that becomes free someday and will be able to come back to America at his own choice.\"</p> <p>The National Council of Churches, which became involved in the case at the request of the Cuban Council of Churches, said it was delighted that Elian was on his way home.</p> <p>\"The courts of our land have done the right thing is saying that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the only one entitled to speak for his son,\" said Rev. Robert Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches.</p> <p>Sally Grooms Cowal, president of Youth for Understanding, which owns the property where Elian stayed, said the child and his family had thanked them for their hospitality. She said the group gave Elian a tour book on Washington, D.C., a globe, a pencil and an American flag. Elian's family reportedly gave them a Cuban flag.</p>",

The 6-year-old and his family were accompanied in a motorcade from the estate where they were staying in Washington to nearby Dulles international airport where a charter plane was waiting to take them to Havana. Juan Miguel Gonzalez, whose car was tracked by television cameras aboard helicopters en route to the airport, said through his lawyer he was relieved the seven-month custody battle with his Miami relatives was finally over. \"Juan Miguel is happy that his family is together, safe and now free to go home. The legal battle is over,\" said the statement released by lawyer Gregory Craig. \"The family will now make immediate arrangements to return to their home,\" the statement added. A sniffer dog was seen checking the plane that would take the Gonzalez family back to Cuba and officials said they would be free to leave once they had gone through customs. The father was expected to make a short statement before their departure. The boy with the impish grin who survived a dramatic shipwreck that claimed his mother's life, shined a spotlight not only on US-Cuban tensions, but also on the rights of parents to make decisions for their children. The highest court in the land rejected without comment or dissent an emergency request by Elian's Miami relatives seeking to keep the boy in the United States and also turned down an appeal seeking a political asylum hearing for him. The court's action ended bitter legal wrangling over the child's fate in a politically charged case that began when he was rescued from the ocean off Florida last November after surviving a shipwreck in which his mother and 10 others died. Elian was reunited with his father on April 22 after armed federal agents seized him from his Miami relatives' home in a dramatic dawn raid in which the screaming child was seen being taken from the house. Hours later, happier pictures were released of Elian with his father, who had come from Cuba in early April to claim custody of his son from the Miami relatives, whom he accused of using the boy as a political tool against President Fidel Castro. Attorney General Janet Reno, who comes from Miami and took a special interest in the case, said she was pleased the Supreme Court had declined to review the Elian case. \"The law has provided a process, and this little boy now knows that he can remain with his father,\" Reno said in a statement. \"All involved have had an opportunity to make their case - all the way to the highest court in the land. I hope that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and join me in wishing this family, and this special little boy, well.\" Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez was gazing at the ocean behind a bayfront church in Miami when he received word that the Supreme Court had refused to consider the case. He turned angrily on a news crew trailing him, shouting at them to leave, while his daughter Marisleysis tugged at his arm and held him back. They and their lawyers planned a news conference later in the day. Asked to comment on the case, President Bill Clinton said if the father had decided to stay in the United States with Elian that would have been \"fine with him,\" adding he wished the case had unfolded in a less dramatic and traumatic way. In Cuba, Castro's government reacted to the court's announcement with a call to Cubans to maintain their \"serenity\" and \"discipline.\" Meticulous arrangements were being made for Elian's Cuban relatives to receive him at Havana's international airport in a low-key ceremony intended to preserve family privacy. The Miami relatives had looked after the boy since he was found by fishermen floating on an inner tube off the Florida coast on the U.S Thanksgiving holiday last November and launched a series of legal challenges to keep him in the United States. They said they wanted him to grow up in freedom in the United States and refused to send him back to live with his father under communist rule in Cuba. Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush voiced dismay about the Supreme Court's decision. \"I'm disappointed he is going back to Cuba,\" Bush said aboard his campaign plane in Cleveland. \"Hopefully he will go down to a Cuba that becomes free someday and will be able to come back to America at his own choice.\" The National Council of Churches, which became involved in the case at the request of the Cuban Council of Churches, said it was delighted that Elian was on his way home. \"The courts of our land have done the right thing is saying that Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the only one entitled to speak for his son,\" said Rev. Robert Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches. Sally Grooms Cowal, president of Youth for Understanding, which owns the property where Elian stayed, said the child and his family had thanked them for their hospitality. She said the group gave Elian a tour book on Washington, D.C., a globe, a pencil and an American flag. Elian's family reportedly gave them a Cuban flag.",

His mother and 10 other people drowned when their boat sank en route from Cuba to the United States, leaving Elian as one of only three survivors. The six-year-old boy spent the next five months as a Miami superstar, constantly cheered and adulated by the Cuban exile community in the city's Little Havana neighbourhood. He was inundated with toys and gifts, and was photographed day and night playing in the yard of his Miami relatives' home. Elian was reunited with his father in Washington after a dawn raid by US immigration officials on April 22. <p><b>Juan Miguel Gonzalez</b><br> Elian's father lived in a white stucco house in a working-class area of Cardenas, a village about two hours east of Havana. A cashier at a Cuban beach resort, Mr Gonzalez had known Elian's mother, Elisabeth Brotons, since they were teenagers. The couple divorced and he remarried. He and his current wife, Nersy, have an infant son, Hianny. </p> <p><b>Lazaro Gonzalez</b><br> Elian's 50-year-old great-uncle led the Miami relatives' fight for custody of the boy. The crowd that gathered night and day outside his Little Havana home would often chant his name. Lazaro Gonzalez was unemployed when the custody battle began, but he soon got his own spokesman, a legal team and a new job as a mechanic. </p> <p><b>Marisleysis Gonzalez</b><br> Elian's 21-year-old cousin became the boy's surrogate mother and was regularly at his side during his time in Miami, escorting him to school or playfully carrying him on her back. She was also among the family's most prominent speakers, constantly lobbying against Elian's return to Fidel Castro's Cuba. She was hospitalised several times after Elian was rescued. Ms Gonzalez quit her job at a bank as an assistant loan processor in April and was considering pursuing a career as a hair stylist. </p> <p><b>Janet Reno</b><br> The US attorney general became Cuban Americans' hate figure after the raid to retrieve Elian. In the protests following the removal of Elian, she was depicted as the devil on signs. Ms Reno has strong ties to Miami, having grown up in a house on the edge of the city and is no stranger to violence there. As state attorney, she charged five white Miami police officers with the killing of a black insurance executive after a motorcycle chase. When they were acquitted in 1980, black rioters looted the city chanting \"Reno, Reno, Reno\". </p> <p><b>Donato Dalrymple</b><br> One of the two men who rescued Elian, Mr Dalrymple, a janitor, became closely linked to the Miami relatives and was holding a crying Elian when an armed federal agent stormed into the bedroom during the April raid. He's suing Ms Reno, deputy attorney general Eric Holder and immigration and naturalisation service commissioner Doris Meissner, seeking damages in excess of $100m because he says his civil rights were violated during the raid. </p> <p><b>Sam Ciancio</b><br> Despite not being able to swim, Mr Ciancio dived into the ocean to save Elian. The 41-year-old roofer and avid fisherman faded into the background and cut ties with his cousin, Mr Dalrymple, because of the circus-like atmosphere that surrounded the fight over Elian. </p> <p><b>Gregory Craig</b><br> Juan Miguel Gonzalez' lawyer served as the special counsel for US President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial. Since graduating from Yale law school in 1972, Mr Craig has represented a variety of clients. He helped defend John Hinckley after his failed attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan and has lobbied Washington power brokers on behalf of a wealthy Haitian family who tried to ward off economic sanctions harmful to its business. </p> <p><b>Spencer Eig</b><br> A member of the Miami relatives' legal team, Mr Eig was a former US immigration and naturalisation service lawyer. The Miami beach immigration lawyer made an unsuccessful bid in 1997 for the Miami beach city commission. </p> <p><b>Kendall Coffey</b><br> In recent months, the most visible member of the Miami relatives' legal team, Mr Coffey resigned as US attorney in Miami in 1996 amid accusations that he bit a topless dancer on the arm at a club where he had gone after losing his biggest drug case in five years - when two people accused of smuggling $2.1bn in cocaine were acquitted. </p> <p><b>Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin</b><br> Ms O'Laughlin acted as a mediator when Elian's Cuban grandmothers visited Florida in January. Ms O'Laughlin, a Catholic nun who is the president of Barry University, first said she had no opinion about whether the boy should be returned. But after the grandmothers' visit, she said Elian should stay in the United States - drawing bitter criticism from the Cuban government and the grandmothers. </p> <p><b>The Rev Joan Brown Campbell</b><br> The former general secretary of the national council of churches, Ms Campbell supported the boy's return to his father. Ms Campbell, a baptist minister, served as the host for Elian's grandmothers on their visit to the United States and visited Juan Miguel Gonzalez in Havana and in the United States. <a href=\"http://www.hud.gov/cb/cbadvis/campbell.html\" target=\"_new\">Brief biography</a></p>",

Marisleysis Gonzalez Elian's 21-year-old cousin became the boy's surrogate mother and was regularly at his side during his time in Miami, escorting him to school or playfully carrying him on her back. She was also among the family's most prominent speakers, constantly lobbying against Elian's return to Fidel Castro's Cuba. She was hospitalised several times after Elian was rescued. Ms Gonzalez quit her job at a bank as an assistant loan processor in April and was considering pursuing a career as a hair stylist. Janet Reno The US attorney general became Cuban Americans' hate figure after the raid to retrieve Elian. In the protests following the removal of Elian, she was depicted as the devil on signs. Ms Reno has strong ties to Miami, having grown up in a house on the edge of the city and is no stranger to violence there. As state attorney, she charged five white Miami police officers with the killing of a black insurance executive after a motorcycle chase. When they were acquitted in 1980, black rioters looted the city chanting \"Reno, Reno, Reno\". Donato Dalrymple One of the two men who rescued Elian, Mr Dalrymple, a janitor, became closely linked to the Miami relatives and was holding a crying Elian when an armed federal agent stormed into the bedroom during the April raid. He's suing Ms Reno, deputy attorney general Eric Holder and immigration and naturalisation service commissioner Doris Meissner, seeking damages in excess of $100m because he says his civil rights were violated during the raid. Sam Ciancio Despite not being able to swim, Mr Ciancio dived into the ocean to save Elian. The 41-year-old roofer and avid fisherman faded into the background and cut ties with his cousin, Mr Dalrymple, because of the circus-like atmosphere that surrounded the fight over Elian. Gregory Craig Juan Miguel Gonzalez' lawyer served as the special counsel for US President Bill Clinton during his impeachment trial. Since graduating from Yale law school in 1972, Mr Craig has represented a variety of clients. He helped defend John Hinckley after his failed attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan and has lobbied Washington power brokers on behalf of a wealthy Haitian family who tried to ward off economic sanctions harmful to its business. Spencer Eig A member of the Miami relatives' legal team, Mr Eig was a former US immigration and naturalisation service lawyer. The Miami beach immigration lawyer made an unsuccessful bid in 1997 for the Miami beach city commission. Kendall Coffey In recent months, the most visible member of the Miami relatives' legal team, Mr Coffey resigned as US attorney in Miami in 1996 amid accusations that he bit a topless dancer on the arm at a club where he had gone after losing his biggest drug case in five years - when two people accused of smuggling $2.1bn in cocaine were acquitted. Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin Ms O'Laughlin acted as a mediator when Elian's Cuban grandmothers visited Florida in January. Ms O'Laughlin, a Catholic nun who is the president of Barry University, first said she had no opinion about whether the boy should be returned. But after the grandmothers' visit, she said Elian should stay in the United States - drawing bitter criticism from the Cuban government and the grandmothers. The Rev Joan Brown Campbell The former general secretary of the national council of churches, Ms Campbell supported the boy's return to his father. Ms Campbell, a baptist minister, served as the host for Elian's grandmothers on their visit to the United States and visited Juan Miguel Gonzalez in Havana and in the United States. Brief biography",

We are set to become a big water supplier, rivalling the big 10 water companies.\"</p> <p>British Waterways is using its 3,000 miles of canals, as well as its 93 reservoirs across the country as \"holding tanks\" for the the scheme. It is one of a number of ideas the public-owned company is using to generate funds to modernise and repair the network.</p> <p>The heyday of canals was the early 19th century, but they began a long decline when the railways arrived. Many were drained and lost, and the rest have been kept from crumbling only by government grants and volunteers. Money from selling drinking water will go towards the \u00a3237m backlog in repairs and maintenance, and help to return the network to pristine condition.</p> <p>Mr Greener said the recovery and reopening of the Stroud Cotswold canal between the Severn and the Thames was possible, because the route could be used for navigation and for pumping water from west to east to supply London.</p> <p>Although a national water grid has long been talked of as a way of solving the south-east's shortages, it has been seen as too costly. But the canals have been used to sell drinking water to Bristol since the 19th century, and in the Midlands industries use the network for their supplies.</p> <p>Mr Greener said: \"All we are doing is reusing and vastly extending a system our engineers know does work. The difference is that we have done the sums and realise it is a money-making venture; we can supply water at a competitive price.\"</p> <p>Mr Greener was speaking at the launching by John Prescott, the environment secretary, of the Waterways for Tomorrow document, which encourages British Waterways to make money as well as offer recreation and navigation - for example, using towpaths to lay fibre optic cables, which this year will earn \u00a36m. Mr Prescott was also keen to use the canals' many \"brownfield\" industrial sites for hotels and housing. Pierre Williams, of the Housebuilders Federation, endorsed the idea. \"Houses close to water fetch premium prices, and are a way of rehabilitating industrial sites.\"</p> <p>The canals earn \u00a3180m a year but need \u00a358.9m in grants from the Treasury to keep going. Mr Greener said he hoped to make them pay their way in 15 years.</p> <p>Canals carry 3m tonnes of freight a year, less than 2% of the total, but Mr Prescott said he hoped to provide grants for companies switching to canals. One trial under way uses the River Lea in north London to ship rubbish to the site of a planned incinerator, where it would provide electricity. The scheme remains controversial but would save hundreds of lorry journeys.</p>",

The chairman of British Waterways, George Greener, said yesterday: \"Now we have proved the scheme can work, the world and his wife wants to talk to us and do a deal. We are set to become a big water supplier, rivalling the big 10 water companies.\" British Waterways is using its 3,000 miles of canals, as well as its 93 reservoirs across the country as \"holding tanks\" for the the scheme. It is one of a number of ideas the public-owned company is using to generate funds to modernise and repair the network. The heyday of canals was the early 19th century, but they began a long decline when the railways arrived. Many were drained and lost, and the rest have been kept from crumbling only by government grants and volunteers. Money from selling drinking water will go towards the \u00a3237m backlog in repairs and maintenance, and help to return the network to pristine condition. Mr Greener said the recovery and reopening of the Stroud Cotswold canal between the Severn and the Thames was possible, because the route could be used for navigation and for pumping water from west to east to supply London. Although a national water grid has long been talked of as a way of solving the south-east's shortages, it has been seen as too costly. But the canals have been used to sell drinking water to Bristol since the 19th century, and in the Midlands industries use the network for their supplies. Mr Greener said: \"All we are doing is reusing and vastly extending a system our engineers know does work. The difference is that we have done the sums and realise it is a money-making venture; we can supply water at a competitive price.\" Mr Greener was speaking at the launching by John Prescott, the environment secretary, of the Waterways for Tomorrow document, which encourages British Waterways to make money as well as offer recreation and navigation - for example, using towpaths to lay fibre optic cables, which this year will earn \u00a36m. Mr Prescott was also keen to use the canals' many \"brownfield\" industrial sites for hotels and housing. Pierre Williams, of the Housebuilders Federation, endorsed the idea. \"Houses close to water fetch premium prices, and are a way of rehabilitating industrial sites.\" The canals earn \u00a3180m a year but need \u00a358.9m in grants from the Treasury to keep going. Mr Greener said he hoped to make them pay their way in 15 years. Canals carry 3m tonnes of freight a year, less than 2% of the total, but Mr Prescott said he hoped to provide grants for companies switching to canals. One trial under way uses the River Lea in north London to ship rubbish to the site of a planned incinerator, where it would provide electricity. The scheme remains controversial but would save hundreds of lorry journeys.",

Jackass penguins, also known as African penguins, are Africa's only penguins and are native to South Africa's coast, where they number about 150,000. Robben Island has been declared a World Heritage Site and is better known as the place where the former South African president, Nelson Mandela, spent most of his 27 years behind bars. The rescue effort is expected to cost at least \u00a3300,000 and SANCCOB has appealed to the public for donations.",

The venture, run through the country's 19,000 post offices, will mean that people on the lowest incomes will have access for the first time to cheque books and cash withdrawal cards, as well as reasonably priced loans to help them steer clear of loan sharks who charge exhorbitant interest rates. The bank will be part of a multi-million pound programme to save thousands of threatened post offices from closure and transform the network into a national agency providing information on a wide range of local and national government services, from benefits advice to details of evening classes. Postmasters and postmistresses will be encouraged to take on a new proactive role as community entrepreneurs - to be known as \"government general practitioners\" - dispensing information and support on matters such as form filling or internet use. Funds will be available to modernise premises and improve security, as well as to open new branches in post office \"deserts\". The rescue plan is intended to address the crisis faced by thousands of sub-post offices because of the imminent loss of their government contract to pay out benefits and pensions, responsible for around a third of their income. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, unveiling the plan today, will stress that the fund will tackle the \"hidden problem\" of closures in run-down inner city areas, as well as the issue of rural post office closures. The extent of closures in the most deprived urban areas and on run-down estates will be revealed today in a report by the government's performance and innovation unit.

Peers were angry that claimants who might simply be \"20 minutes late\" for an appointment with a probation officer could be penalised so severely - losing up to 26 weeks benefit - without any prior endorsement by a court. The 170-116 vote defeat on the child support, pensions and social security bill was the second of the night and the 17th since the government purged all but 92 of the hereditary peers from the unelected upper house. A cross-party alliance had already voted by 166-135 to safeguard the rights of widows and widowers who were victims of misinformation over the benefits they might expect under state-related pensions (Serps) when changes were made by Conservative ministers in the 1980s. The junior social security minister, Lady Hollis, had claimed that government changes to Serps had addressed the problem. On both votes the Department of Social Security said it would respond \"in due course\". The major attack came on CSOs and benefit withdrawal and prompted the former Tory minister and ex-parole board chairman, Lord Windlesham, to protest that \"if indeed there is a rationale for this legislative process, it is rooted not only in deep ignorance of deviant behaviour and the most effective ways of countering it\".

The prime minister's press secretary has instructed officials in every Whitehall department to produce at least two \"substantial news stories\" every week for two months \"highlighting the government's core message\". They will be released during the parliamentary recess in August and September in an attempt to secure favourable media coverage. The leaked memo follows last month's disclosure that Tony Blair had ordered civil servants to come up with \"killer facts\" to beat William Hague at their weekly Commons duel at prime minister's question time. The orchestrated campaign of spin was described as \"unprecedented\" by one civil servant and triggered Tory calls last night for Mr Campbell to be stripped of public duties. A note sent round the Cabinet Office yesterday and obtained by the Guardian underlines how Mr Campbell is running the government's spin operation as head of the Downing Street strategic communications unit. Although taking a lower public profile by appearing infrequently at the twice daily Westminster press briefings, he is playing a full role behind the scenes. The memo, inspired by a longer letter from Mr Campbell to departments, was written by a civil service press officer, Tim Hunt, and sent to key figures in the department, including Michael Pakenham, chairman of the joint intelligence committee which assesses reports from MI5 and MI6, and Moira Wallace, head of the social exclusion unit. The message said: \"Alastair Campbell wishes to draw up a plan to ensure a steady stream of stories highlighting the government's core messages through the summer recess. \"He has asked that each government department provides at least two substantial news stories per week throughout August and September, noting in each case the message which it will convey. \"I should be grateful if heads of management units can identify at least two suitable stories each which we can submit to No 10.

      "body": "<p>William Hague suffered an embarrassing blow to his credibility last night when it emerged that a senior Foreign Office mandarin has branded his European policy \"barmy\".</p> <p>In notes written on an internal Foreign Office memorandum, which has been passed to the Guardian, the head of its EU department launched a withering attack on Mr Hague's plans to apply for British membership of the North America Free Trade Area (Nafta).</p> <p>\"This is a pretty barmy study,\" Simon Featherstone wrote of an investigation into possible British membership of Nafta, which was inspired by Tory frontbenchers.</p> <p>The memorandum outlined the government's response to an investigation by a powerful American senate committee into the possibility of Britain joining the free trade area.

      "bodyText": "William Hague suffered an embarrassing blow to his credibility last night when it emerged that a senior Foreign Office mandarin has branded his European policy \"barmy\". In notes written on an internal Foreign Office memorandum, which has been passed to the Guardian, the head of its EU department launched a withering attack on Mr Hague's plans to apply for British membership of the North America Free Trade Area (Nafta). \"This is a pretty barmy study,\" Simon Featherstone wrote of an investigation into possible British membership of Nafta, which was inspired by Tory frontbenchers. The memorandum outlined the government's response to an investigation by a powerful American senate committee into the possibility of Britain joining the free trade area. The investigation, which was launched by Republicans after a lobbying campaign by Tory frontbench Eurosceptics, is supported by Mr Hague who wants Britain to join Nafta. The memorandum, written by Colin Dick of the Foreign Office's EU department, said British officials would have to meet members of the US international trade commission carrying out the Nafta investigation on behalf of the senate committee. But Mr Dick is dismissive of the entire project, saying that the Republican senator Phil Gramm had launched the investigation after being \"encouraged to do so by the UK Conservative party\". The memo says that the investigation is based on two \"hypothetical models\" which would see Britain either joining Nafta as a member of the EU or abandoning the EU to join the trade area. Mr Dick warns that the investigation could be \"used mischievously by those who would like Britain to leave the EU\".

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs braced themselves for a period of party turbulence last night as Andrew Mackinlay's bid to become the backbenchers' shop steward - with enhanced powers - triggered further criticism of the current leadership. Today's weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) will see Margaret Beckett, leader of the Commons, face criticism from MPs on both wings of the party over government reluctance to modernise procedures - not least to give backbenchers greater powers to hold the executive to account. Robert Sheldon, veteran chairman of the backbench liaison committee - consisting of all 25 committee chairmen - will press Mrs Beckett to endorse the case for such committees to control their own membership, free from the conformist pressure from government whips. Other senior MPs will back him, not least because they want more done to campaign for better terms and pay for their staff at Westminster. It was the decision of Clive Soley, current chairman of the PLP, publicly to back the government in resisting such reforms which helped goad Mr Mackinlay into announcing yesterday yesterday that he will challenge him for the job in November. Mr Soley warned: \"I think it's very unwise to go for what is, in effect, a four-months election campaign.\" He reminded MPs how damaging it had been for Conservatives to see the chairmen of their 1922 committee openly criticise John Major. Mr Mackinlay brushed aside such fears. \"I am not so much standing against the present incumbent as, more importantly, seeking to shape and mould a roll for this important office,\" the MP for Thurrock said. He wants future PLP chairmen to become US-style \"caucus leaders\" with the right to be heard by the prime minister of the day, especially since Britain is \"inexorably moving towards a presidential style of government.\"",

Another 12 Zanu-PF MPs already face court proceedings on various charges, including Chenjerai \"Hitler\" Hunzvi, the leader of the war veterans who have invaded white-owned farms. But the opposition does not want to get bogged down in legal battles. It wants to build experience in a parliament where none of its members has ever sat.",

Unlike many other white farmers, Mr Hart decided to keep supporting the MDC and to evacuate his farm.</p> <p>\"I just didn't see any future for the country under Zanu-PF,\" he said. \"They have bankrupt policies that have taken the country to the brink of collapse economically. They have broken down the rule of law. It amounts to rule by a bunch of gangsters. I felt I had to stand up and support something better for the country.\"</p> <p><b> Politics</b><br> Like many of Zimbabwe's white minority, Mr Hart had not taken an interest in politics since independence. \"Most whites accepted the status quo as long as we were in our comfort zone,\" he said. \"But now I believe if we want to stay here then we must be involved in politics.\"</p> <p>For two years Mr Hart developed his farm as a producer of paprika and marigolds, both for export. \"It is a small property and I have used the land intensively, with irrigation. I think it is the way forward for agriculture in this country. I think we must work with small-scale African farmers to get them to produce these export crops as well.\"</p> <p>Mr Hart's efforts to work with black farmers and to support the MDC were thrown into disarray in May when David Stevens, a white farmer from the nearby Macheke area, was murdered by Zanu-PF supporters. Over the next few weeks four other white farmers were killed. After that, Mr Hart had to take it seriously when his name appeared on a \"hit list\" circulated by top Zanu-PF officials.</p> <p>The president, Robert Mugabe, based his party's electoral campaign on the land issue and concentrated on painting the country's white farmers as demons. He repeatedly said that white Rhodesians stole land from black Africans without paying any compensation and therefore it was time for Africans to take back their land. Mr Mugabe incited his supporters to invade white-owned farms and claim them as their own.</p> <p>But there are many who do not fit Mr Mugabe's definition of white farmer equals white racism. Mr Hart is one of them. He is leasing his 25-hectare farm from a black African woman. He believes he is a good and fair employer and has ambitious plans to help black Africans start up similar small export operations. After the threats, he had to reduce his staff from 15 to 12 employees and could only safely visit his farm for a few hours every two weeks.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Hart returned to the abandoned farmhouse to oversee the preparation of fields for a new crop of marigolds. Now that Zimbabwe's elections are over, Mr Hart wants to move back onto the farm with his family, but he is not certain if he will be safe from the violence of state-sponsored war veterans and Zanu-PF supporters. \"Once they've let the genie out of the bottle that brings violence and intimidation, it will be hard to put it back in. Zanu-PF has made promises they can't keep and that does not augur well for a return to normality.\"</p> <p>The future of Zimbabwe's agriculture is equally uncertain. More than 1,400 farms are occupied by Zanu-PF supporters. On Mr Mugabe's orders, police have refused to protect the mostly white owners. Mr Mugabe has taken steps to seize 804 farms without paying compensation and he vowed repeatedly during the election campaign that poor blacks would be moved onto those farms quickly.</p> <p><b> Jobs at risk</b><br> A great deal is at stake. The commercial farms are Zimbabwe's largest employer with more than 300,000 full-time jobs. It is also the country's largest earner of desperately short foreign exchange. The widespread violence on the commercial farms has contributed to a more general breakdown of law and order.</p> <p>But it is not clear if Mr Mugabe will order his followers off the occupied farms or begin land redistribution programme. Some officials say Mr Mugabe is determined to pursue the course he has begun.</p> <p>\"It is more than just the future of commercial agriculture that is uncertain,\" said David Gollach, director of a firm which processes paprika for export. \"We don't know if Mugabe will change the economic policies that are ruining this country. We don't know if he will pull our troops out of the Congo war. We don't know if he will order the police to restore the rule of law.\"</p> <p>But Mr Gollach is optimistic. \"This is the beginning of the end for Mugabe and the beginning of a viable democracy,\" he said. \"The MDC achieved more than simply winning 57 seats. It attracted support from blacks and whites, Shonas and Ndebeles, urban and rural people. The MDC is a truly national party and that is a great achievement.</p> <p>\"In contrast, Zanu-PF is not nearly so impressive. Mugabe won the election but he destroyed the country and the economy to do it. He will find it very difficult to rule over the shambles he has created.\"</p>",

Unlike many other white farmers, Mr Hart decided to keep supporting the MDC and to evacuate his farm. \"I just didn't see any future for the country under Zanu-PF,\" he said. \"They have bankrupt policies that have taken the country to the brink of collapse economically. They have broken down the rule of law. It amounts to rule by a bunch of gangsters. I felt I had to stand up and support something better for the country.\" Politics Like many of Zimbabwe's white minority, Mr Hart had not taken an interest in politics since independence. \"Most whites accepted the status quo as long as we were in our comfort zone,\" he said. \"But now I believe if we want to stay here then we must be involved in politics.\" For two years Mr Hart developed his farm as a producer of paprika and marigolds, both for export. \"It is a small property and I have used the land intensively, with irrigation. I think it is the way forward for agriculture in this country. I think we must work with small-scale African farmers to get them to produce these export crops as well.\" Mr Hart's efforts to work with black farmers and to support the MDC were thrown into disarray in May when David Stevens, a white farmer from the nearby Macheke area, was murdered by Zanu-PF supporters. Over the next few weeks four other white farmers were killed. After that, Mr Hart had to take it seriously when his name appeared on a \"hit list\" circulated by top Zanu-PF officials. The president, Robert Mugabe, based his party's electoral campaign on the land issue and concentrated on painting the country's white farmers as demons. He repeatedly said that white Rhodesians stole land from black Africans without paying any compensation and therefore it was time for Africans to take back their land. Mr Mugabe incited his supporters to invade white-owned farms and claim them as their own. But there are many who do not fit Mr Mugabe's definition of white farmer equals white racism. Mr Hart is one of them. He is leasing his 25-hectare farm from a black African woman. He believes he is a good and fair employer and has ambitious plans to help black Africans start up similar small export operations. After the threats, he had to reduce his staff from 15 to 12 employees and could only safely visit his farm for a few hours every two weeks. Yesterday Mr Hart returned to the abandoned farmhouse to oversee the preparation of fields for a new crop of marigolds. Now that Zimbabwe's elections are over, Mr Hart wants to move back onto the farm with his family, but he is not certain if he will be safe from the violence of state-sponsored war veterans and Zanu-PF supporters. \"Once they've let the genie out of the bottle that brings violence and intimidation, it will be hard to put it back in. Zanu-PF has made promises they can't keep and that does not augur well for a return to normality.\" The future of Zimbabwe's agriculture is equally uncertain. More than 1,400 farms are occupied by Zanu-PF supporters. On Mr Mugabe's orders, police have refused to protect the mostly white owners. Mr Mugabe has taken steps to seize 804 farms without paying compensation and he vowed repeatedly during the election campaign that poor blacks would be moved onto those farms quickly. Jobs at risk A great deal is at stake. The commercial farms are Zimbabwe's largest employer with more than 300,000 full-time jobs. It is also the country's largest earner of desperately short foreign exchange. The widespread violence on the commercial farms has contributed to a more general breakdown of law and order. But it is not clear if Mr Mugabe will order his followers off the occupied farms or begin land redistribution programme. Some officials say Mr Mugabe is determined to pursue the course he has begun. \"It is more than just the future of commercial agriculture that is uncertain,\" said David Gollach, director of a firm which processes paprika for export. \"We don't know if Mugabe will change the economic policies that are ruining this country. We don't know if he will pull our troops out of the Congo war. We don't know if he will order the police to restore the rule of law.\" But Mr Gollach is optimistic. \"This is the beginning of the end for Mugabe and the beginning of a viable democracy,\" he said. \"The MDC achieved more than simply winning 57 seats. It attracted support from blacks and whites, Shonas and Ndebeles, urban and rural people. The MDC is a truly national party and that is a great achievement. \"In contrast, Zanu-PF is not nearly so impressive. Mugabe won the election but he destroyed the country and the economy to do it. He will find it very difficult to rule over the shambles he has created.\"",

As if comparing the creation of his new job with America's declaration of independence is not grandiose enough, Ken allows himself a fantasy about the capital joining the euro - on its own. \"London could clearly survive as a separate, independent country within Europe,\" he says, noting that the city's economy is overtaking that of Austria and that its population is \"up there in the Belgium league\".</p> <p>So far, big talk like that is pretty well all Livingstone has been able to produce. Instead of that bash he wanted on Monday, he promises \"a big, boring speech\". There will be no magic wand to transform the capital overnight, no instant sense of living in Livingstone's London - for the same reason there could be no splashy party. He just doesn't have the staff. Unlike his counterparts in Edinburgh and Cardiff, Ken had no equivalent of the Scottish or Welsh Office to inherit. He has had to create a machine from scratch. That has forced him to spend the eight weeks since his victory knee-deep in job applications and \"transition meetings\". He predicts it will be Christmas before he can really start making a difference.</p> <p>Which is a smart politician's way of lowering expectations. The truth, Livingstone admits, is that he \"loves\" the job, even before it has started. His every move gets publicity, whether handing posts to former rivals, such as Glenda Jackson and Steve Norris, or asking Bob Geldof to organise yet another big party for New Year's Eve. And, despite the frustrations, he has some real power. He has been horrified to discover that he alone can decide on planning applications. He's realised that a corrupt successor could grow very fat on the bribes of property developers. All of which makes Mayor Livingstone a figure of envy - at least to the 1,500 or so people gathering in Bournemouth today. They are the Local Government Association, foot soldiers in the army of grassroots democracy. And their outlook is not nearly as sunny as Ken's.</p> <p>Not for them the buzz of a glamour mayoralty. They are stuck with the thankless tasks of clearing up rubbish, organising libraries and tending the elderly in villages, towns and cities which don't get Technicolor attention. But that is not their complaint; they are happy with the job they are supposed to do. The problem is a central government which seems hell bent on stopping them doing it.</p> <p>The paradox of New Labour used to be that it decentralised more power than any government had ever done before - via devolution - only to deal with party activists and the press like a power-grabbing control freak.</p> <p>Yet now we have a prime minister who admits his attempt to stop Welsh Labourites picking Rhodri Morgan was a \"mistake\" and who tells the WI he no longer wants to fight over \"every headline\". Meanwhile, in the areas of substance that matter, the government is sending the devolution process into reverse - crushing local authorities by grabbing their powers and keeping them for Whitehall. The paradox has been reversed. Now Labour seems ready to loosen its grip on message - but determined to keep control over power.</p> <p>So Gordon Brown's last budget bypassed local education authorities by sending top-up money for schools directly to head teachers. Now the LEAs fear they will be done away with altogether, with London sending even the core money to schools direct. In health something similar is afoot, with Alan Milburn centralising yet further an already centralised service. Local councils now fear the health secretary is eyeing up one of their biggest jobs: responsibility for the elderly. In every government department there are ministers and bureaucrats handing money to councils on condition that they spend it Whitehall's way - to meet Whitehall's targets on Whitehall's timetable.</p> <p>No wonder people in local government feel as besieged as they were in the dark days of Thatcherism. Not only is turnout in local elections depressingly low but now, as then, they face an ideological enemy in Downing Street. For all his talk of community, Tony Blair has little patience or respect for councillors and their works. In the Blairite view, local democracy is not the route to efficient public services, but an obstacle in the way. If schools need to be turned around, then LEAs are not the ones to do it; only Whitehall can. The government's guiding maxim is the old cliche: \"If a job needs doing, you'd better do it yourself.\"</p> <p>That leaves the folks in Bournemouth with quite a challenge. They have to tackle head-on the notion that democracy and quality are enemies. They could begin by pointing out that central government is hardly a paragon of efficiency itself. Ken Livingstone says no local council could ever match the Home Office's asylum and immigration department for sheer \"incompetent maladministration\". And it is the ultra-centralised NHS which has produced \"postcode rationing\" - failing to bring the equality of provision that is meant to be central government's forte.</p> <p>Next, councillors have to improve their own performance, providing better services and communicating with their constituents more often and more fluently (one of Bournemouth's big themes). They need to disprove their critics in central government, showing they can raise their game.</p> <p>Finally, they have to remake the case for democracy in principle. That means persuading us all that a pin-striped bureaucrat in Whitehall is never going to organise a home-help system for the elderly in South Shields as well as a person who lives among, and was elected by, the people of South Shields. They need to turn back on Labour the very same logic Labour itself deployed to argue for devolution in Scotland, Wales and London: that, in Mayor Livingstone's words, \"You can't run Britain from the centre.\"</p> <p>If the folks gathering in Bournemouth today can remake that case, they will not only arrest Labour's stealth programme of centralisation. They might even even create a virtuous circle. For the better job they do, the more power and money we'll all be prepared to give them - and the more we'll want to vote when their jobs come up for election. Ken has shown that local democracy can be exciting. Now the grassroots army have to show that it can work.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

He predicts it will be Christmas before he can really start making a difference. Which is a smart politician's way of lowering expectations. The truth, Livingstone admits, is that he \"loves\" the job, even before it has started. His every move gets publicity, whether handing posts to former rivals, such as Glenda Jackson and Steve Norris, or asking Bob Geldof to organise yet another big party for New Year's Eve. And, despite the frustrations, he has some real power. He has been horrified to discover that he alone can decide on planning applications. He's realised that a corrupt successor could grow very fat on the bribes of property developers. All of which makes Mayor Livingstone a figure of envy - at least to the 1,500 or so people gathering in Bournemouth today. They are the Local Government Association, foot soldiers in the army of grassroots democracy. And their outlook is not nearly as sunny as Ken's. Not for them the buzz of a glamour mayoralty. They are stuck with the thankless tasks of clearing up rubbish, organising libraries and tending the elderly in villages, towns and cities which don't get Technicolor attention. But that is not their complaint; they are happy with the job they are supposed to do. The problem is a central government which seems hell bent on stopping them doing it. The paradox of New Labour used to be that it decentralised more power than any government had ever done before - via devolution - only to deal with party activists and the press like a power-grabbing control freak. Yet now we have a prime minister who admits his attempt to stop Welsh Labourites picking Rhodri Morgan was a \"mistake\" and who tells the WI he no longer wants to fight over \"every headline\". Meanwhile, in the areas of substance that matter, the government is sending the devolution process into reverse - crushing local authorities by grabbing their powers and keeping them for Whitehall. The paradox has been reversed. Now Labour seems ready to loosen its grip on message - but determined to keep control over power. So Gordon Brown's last budget bypassed local education authorities by sending top-up money for schools directly to head teachers. Now the LEAs fear they will be done away with altogether, with London sending even the core money to schools direct. In health something similar is afoot, with Alan Milburn centralising yet further an already centralised service. Local councils now fear the health secretary is eyeing up one of their biggest jobs: responsibility for the elderly. In every government department there are ministers and bureaucrats handing money to councils on condition that they spend it Whitehall's way - to meet Whitehall's targets on Whitehall's timetable. No wonder people in local government feel as besieged as they were in the dark days of Thatcherism. Not only is turnout in local elections depressingly low but now, as then, they face an ideological enemy in Downing Street. For all his talk of community, Tony Blair has little patience or respect for councillors and their works. In the Blairite view, local democracy is not the route to efficient public services, but an obstacle in the way. If schools need to be turned around, then LEAs are not the ones to do it; only Whitehall can. The government's guiding maxim is the old cliche: \"If a job needs doing, you'd better do it yourself.\" That leaves the folks in Bournemouth with quite a challenge. They have to tackle head-on the notion that democracy and quality are enemies. They could begin by pointing out that central government is hardly a paragon of efficiency itself. Ken Livingstone says no local council could ever match the Home Office's asylum and immigration department for sheer \"incompetent maladministration\". And it is the ultra-centralised NHS which has produced \"postcode rationing\" - failing to bring the equality of provision that is meant to be central government's forte. Next, councillors have to improve their own performance, providing better services and communicating with their constituents more often and more fluently (one of Bournemouth's big themes). They need to disprove their critics in central government, showing they can raise their game. Finally, they have to remake the case for democracy in principle. That means persuading us all that a pin-striped bureaucrat in Whitehall is never going to organise a home-help system for the elderly in South Shields as well as a person who lives among, and was elected by, the people of South Shields. They need to turn back on Labour the very same logic Labour itself deployed to argue for devolution in Scotland, Wales and London: that, in Mayor Livingstone's words, \"You can't run Britain from the centre.\" If the folks gathering in Bournemouth today can remake that case, they will not only arrest Labour's stealth programme of centralisation. They might even even create a virtuous circle. For the better job they do, the more power and money we'll all be prepared to give them - and the more we'll want to vote when their jobs come up for election. Ken has shown that local democracy can be exciting. Now the grassroots army have to show that it can work. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

Twenty-eight million people may use post offices every week but it's mainly the old and the poor who stand in queues. Fond nostalgia for post offices may not translate into frequent use by more lucrative customers.</p> <p>The crisis for the nation's 19,000 post offices comes to a head in 2003, when all benefits will be paid into claimants' bank accounts, and not over the post office counter. These new automatic credit transfers will save the state a fortune - each payment that now costs 49p to administer will cost only 1p. But for post offices it spells disaster, since one third of their income comes from the contract with the benefits agency: without that many of these marginal sub-post offices would close. (Only 600 are crown post offices, the rest are franchised private businesses.) Thousands of sub-post masters marched on Downing Street a couple of months ago, alerting government to their plight. It isn't just village post offices at risk.

But Michael Heseltine drew back, faced with overwhelming opposition from his own tribe, outraged at the sacrilege to the Queen's head on the stamp and the risk to rural post offices in Tory heartland shires. Giro bank was sold off and Mrs Thatcher had to be satisfied with that. When Tony Blair reached the part of his speech to the WI where he mentioned rural post offices, the women broke out in the loudest jeers of all, shouting \"No! No!\" Although he promised to preserve them, they weren't listening or didn't believe it. But he meant it and tomorrow they will see it when the government sets out a multimillion pound rescue and revitalisation plan.</p> <p>First there will be a new bank at the post office, the Universal Bank. It will reach the 3.5m people who have no bank account, the \"unbanked underclass\" who lose out heavily for lack of decent financial services. Pensioners and claimants will have their benefits paid into their Universal Bank account at the post office: if they wish they can collect their money in cash as usual. But the aim is to help them use direct debits for bills, so they too can gain the 10% discounts earned by the middle classes but not by the poor. They too can have cheque books and cards for withdrawing their money when and where they choose. Most important, they will get access to loans for first time and escape the clutches of loan sharking companies, often their only source of credit.</p> <p>The big banks are to have their arms sharply twisted to help found this new bank, rubbing their noses in the shameful way they have abandoned every unprofitable community, rural and urban alike.</p> <p>However the Universal Bank won't on its own generate enough post office business to compensate for the loss of the benefit payments. The government's performance and innovation unit looked long and hard at the post office business. It weighed up profits and losses (8,000 post offices already lose money, before the benefit money is withdrawn). Then they weighed up the social value and found that postmasters and postmen act as advisers, friends and supporters of the old, the poor and the lost. They are trusted as no other arm of government. That trust and affection is too valuable to be thrown away as unprofitable. So tomorrow the government will announce payments of many millions to develop that role for sub-post offices, turning them into \"government general practitioners\". They will be trained to become the semi-professional point of access for every kind of government service. Already 170 different services cross the post office counter, but why not more? Why not information about local adult education classes, local school league tables, volunteering, access to all local government services from pest control to dustbin inquiries? Why not add internet access terminals and offer information from the internet for those who can't use it themselves? The government will pay sub-post offices a fee to do all this in the areas that most need it, both in villages and in urban wastelands. (Urban post offices in well-served areas would have to sink or swim on their own initiative.) The idea is for the post office to become the friendly and useful face of government in an ever more complex world, where people don't know where to turn for help. At the same time, they will offer more professional help for sub-post offices to generate commercial income, sweeping away the fly-blown old image of the worst.</p> <p>All this springs from the government's aim to regenerate places bereft of any sense of community. Some post offices may never be profitable but they could become focal, energising local centres to encourage other enterprises back into desolate places. The bottom line is no longer the most important thing: value to the community matters more. This is precisely the kind of thinking we need more of. Since we are to become so much richer in the next decade (national growth of at least 30%), for the first time there is the finance, the intelligence and the will to spend that money well - not squandered on private excess and extravagance, but well spent on public things people most prize in their communities, from the rich in their model villages to the poor on their housing estates, a perfect lesson in the good value of public spending.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

QCs for 113 relatives and for eight national newspaper groups and the BBC branded as \"irrational\" the decision by Mr Milburn to hold the inquiry behind closed doors. Thirty relatives were in court to hear their QC, Augustus Ullstein, tell Lord Justice Kennedy and Mr Justice Jackson that an inquiry open to the public and the press was vital \"to restore faith and confidence in general practitioners and the NHS\". It was not enough, he said, that the report would be published along with any evidence the inquiry team deemed \"appropriate.\" For the media, Desmond Browne QC said: \"It is not just the confidence of the families who have been bereaved which has been undermined.\" He said Mr Milburn appeared to have ignored the need to restore public confidence generally in the NHS, which was a function of the media, and instead regarded news organisations as intrusive and took the view there was a need to protect the families from their \"malign attentions\". But the families had made it clear they themselves wanted a full and open inquiry. It was the \"vital role of the press as public watchdog\" to report the proceedings and assure the public \"that nothing is being swept under the carpet\", said Mr Browne. Shipman, 54, of Mottram in Longendale, Greater Manchester, was convicted at Preston crown court of murdering 15 patients, but he is suspected of killing nearly 200. Mr Ullstein said the relatives had been led to believe the inquiry would be in public because Mr Milburn had referred to a \"public inquiry\" in statements in the House of Commons. But he had decided the inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming, a former head of the social services inspectorate, should be in private. Mr Ullstein argued that those statements had given the relatives a \"legitimate expectation\" that the inquiry would be public. Had the inquiry been set up under the Tribunals and Inquiries (Evidence) Act 1921, it would have been public, with power for the relatives to have legal representation paid from public funds and to cross-examine witnesses. But because Mr Milburn had established it up under the National Health Service Act 1977, it could be held in private, with no legal representation for relatives, and they would have no right to see statements submitted by witnesses or to cross-examine witnesses. Mr Ullstein said Mr Milburn had no power to use the NHS Act model, because the inquiry's terms of reference covered not only health service matters but also the roles of the coroner and police, death certification and controls on drugs - all matters outside the remit of the act. Backing the relatives' application for judicial review are Associated Newspapers, Express Newspapers, Guardian Media Group, Guardian Newspapers, MGN Ltd, News Group Newspapers, Telegraph Group, Times Newspapers and the BBC.

      "bodyText": "The government is letting the country down by failing to support the institution of marriage, a senior Church of England bishop claimed yesterday. The Right Rev Michael Scott-Joynt, bishop of Winchester, ranked fifth in the church's hierarchy, and chairman of its marriage working party, said ministers' ambivalence amounted to a denial of responsibility for one of the bedrocks of a stable society. The attack, at a conference on marriage in Plymouth, follows reports last year on marriage and whether those who have been divorced should be allowed to remarry in church - an issue of crucial importance given that the Prince of Wales, who will become supreme governor of the Church of England when he succeeds to the throne, is divorced and may marry a divorcee. The bishop told the conference: \"In the first years of the present New Labour government the churches, and especially the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales and the Church of England, were hopeful that the government would prove explicitly supportive of marriage both in fiscal and other supportive provision and more generally in its language and perceived stance. \"[But] there is an explicit denial of any responsibility to support marriage for itself as fundamental to human flourishing, a stance consistently confirmed ... by the government's refusal, as it has dismissively put it, to 'preach about marriage' and to contemplate any discrimination (I use the word advisedly) between marriage on the one hand and stable relationships, whether same sex or heterosexual, on the other.\" The assault comes as both the prime minister and William Hague are courting Christian voters and claiming to be supportive of traditional values. Tony Blair is addressing a conference in Germany organised by the Catholic theologian Hans Kung later this week and in 10 days time will speak to black evangelical church leaders in Brighton. Mr Hague has said that Conservatives are the party most supportive of married couples and families. The bishop claimed that church disillusionment followed publication of the government's Supporting Families green paper in 1998, criticised by the church's board of social responsibility as ambivalent towards marriage.",

Who knows how the People found her, but the photograph used of Michelle is said to resemble the People's staff reporter Lucy Panton. When we ring, Lucy recovers from the shock to issue an engagingly half-hearted denial. \"It's, um, nothing to do with me,\" she says. But have you anything to say off the record? \"Um, errrrr . . . there's another call coming through.\" Click, brrrr. Oh dear. Effete editor Neil Wallis, whose circulatory problems seem to indicate his own amputation, was in charge last week but is now on holiday, while his deputy Alan Edwards is tied up in \"conference\" the entire afternoon (but of course: Tuesdays are frantic for Sunday papers) and fails to return any of our several calls.

Scottish troops, then.</p> <p>\u0095 Can anyone help Carlton television with a mystery? An email sent to all staff recently by one Lorraine Hutchin inquires: \"Do you know McCready and co ltd? The finance department have received a cheque for \u00a321,623.65 from the above company for sound van and equip. As the company are no longer contactable, is there anybody out there that knows what this cheque relates to?\" But isn't that just typical of Carlton . . . they're so busy worrying about making fine programmes that they simply don't have time to concentrate on the money side of the business.</p> <p>\u0095 In relentlessly controversial Saga magazine, Mo Mowlam causes a stir by suggesting the Queen be turfed out of Buckingham Palace. If anyone is baffled why Mo's remarks about shoving the Queen out of Buckingham Palace have surfaced now, when she first made them six years ago, it's very simple. The people at Saga have only just remembered. \"Which one, dear? Oh, the nice one in the green cardie? Yes, it's coming back to me now . . . didn't she say something funny about the Queen?\" Elsewhere in the interview, our most beloved Mo is on cute form when asked about the poisonous briefings against her last year. \"Somebody is not happy with me, I know that,\" she replies. \"I don't think it's Tony Blair.\" I don't think it's Tony Blair - very nicely judged, Mo. Very delicate.</p> <p>\u0095 A cellophane-wrapped chocolate arrives, with \"The British Council\" iced upon it. Good to see a body dedicated to promoting British business prepared to advertise itself. For God's sake, there's nothing to be ashamed of in selling our country and her splendid products to the world - and yes, woolly-minded chatterers, that means us too. On the back of the cellophane, meanwhile, in smaller lettering, are the words \"Made in Belgium\".</p> <p>\u0095 At last, the government finally shaking off its exhausting obsession with presentation, and the Civil Service is the first to benefit.

As the company are no longer contactable, is there anybody out there that knows what this cheque relates to?\" But isn't that just typical of Carlton . . . they're so busy worrying about making fine programmes that they simply don't have time to concentrate on the money side of the business. \u0095 In relentlessly controversial Saga magazine, Mo Mowlam causes a stir by suggesting the Queen be turfed out of Buckingham Palace. If anyone is baffled why Mo's remarks about shoving the Queen out of Buckingham Palace have surfaced now, when she first made them six years ago, it's very simple. The people at Saga have only just remembered. \"Which one, dear? Oh, the nice one in the green cardie? Yes, it's coming back to me now . . . didn't she say something funny about the Queen?\" Elsewhere in the interview, our most beloved Mo is on cute form when asked about the poisonous briefings against her last year. \"Somebody is not happy with me, I know that,\" she replies. \"I don't think it's Tony Blair.\" I don't think it's Tony Blair - very nicely judged, Mo. Very delicate. \u0095 A cellophane-wrapped chocolate arrives, with \"The British Council\" iced upon it. Good to see a body dedicated to promoting British business prepared to advertise itself. For God's sake, there's nothing to be ashamed of in selling our country and her splendid products to the world - and yes, woolly-minded chatterers, that means us too. On the back of the cellophane, meanwhile, in smaller lettering, are the words \"Made in Belgium\". \u0095 At last, the government finally shaking off its exhausting obsession with presentation, and the Civil Service is the first to benefit. A colleague ringing the Department of Health with a factual query is told: \"I'm sorry, I'm a media officer. You need a press officer.\" Of course, of course.",

      "body": "<p>At the main entrance to Bradwell nuclear power station, the first thing you hear is the clinking of flagpoles. There are three of them outside the gates and another inside, very tall and white against the wide Essex skies. In the wind off the sea, and off the flat fields and rivers to all sides, the flagpoles' ropes twitch expectantly. Freshly trimmed lawns and flowerbeds beckon towards the gatehouse. A dummy nuclear waste flask on a plinth awaits inspection. </p> <p>But visiting dignitaries rarely come to Bradwell these days. Just the odd school party or middle-aged couple. And the flagpoles are empty, except the tallest one. It flies the company flag of British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), a small flapping rectangle of the mildest blue. It almost looks like an apology. </p> <p>Bradwell is Britain's oldest commercial nuclear power station still in operation. It was opened 37 years ago by the then Lord Lieutenant of Essex, Sir John Ruggles-Brise. It was, for a brief period, the world's most successful nuclear power station, in terms of total electricity supplied. In its new smooth cubes of concrete and glass, pipes and ducts proudly visible inside, the industry's distant heroic age was played out. Newspapers hailed Bradwell and Britain's programme as \"progressive\" and \"the largest in the world\". </p> <p>Now \"the Monster of the Marshes\" is closing down. Last month, it was confirmed that all the British Magnox reactors, our unique national experiment with magnesium alloy, uranium and optimistic accounting, will be switched off, with Bradwell the first in less than two years' time. A scattering of other nuclear power stations will keep generating for a decade or two, in obscure corners of the British Isles, but the industry's impetus feels long gone. No new reactors are being built. Safety scandals seem unceasing. Germany, Japan and Sweden have stopped importing our radioactive fuel. BNFL, once thought ripe for privatising, is now reportedly ruined as a commercial prospect because of the cost of cleaning up after itself. </p> <p>Last year, 27.6% of our electricity came from nuclear power, down from 28.9% the year before. This figure is expected to drop further as the Magnox plants close and the rest grow old. France and America, the other atomic energy pioneers, have both stopped constructing reactors. The whole nuclear equation, the once confident balancing of public attitudes, technical possibilities and economic benefits, now seems absurdly optimistic. Nuclear power, even from the most modern station, even without including the expenses of decommissioning, is still about twice as costly as conventional electricity production. Public opinion has turned sceptical. Valerie Mainwood, one of the founders of the Stop Bradwell campaign in the mid-80s, gives a small smile: \"I've done the job I set out to do.\" </p> <p>The road to Bradwell struggles up the Dengie peninsula, in emptiest, easternmost Essex. The railway gives out at Southminster, six miles short. After a small eternity of sharp corners - which the nuclear waste trucks, too, have to negotiate - past dusty farms and an abandoned hotel, the station comes suddenly into view. It rises, grey and vast, above wheatfields and a bank of fir trees, like an installation from the former Soviet Union. From a distance, the great reactor cubes and the long turbine hall look streamlined, almost modern. Up closer, the black streaks on the concrete, the dirty scaffolding and old Portakabins tell a different story. Nobody builds power stations out of pebbledash any more. </p> <p>\"There's no more budget to keep it running beyond 2002,\" said the tour guide, as he led the way along a formica corridor. He had grey in his beard, had been at Bradwell two decades, and seemed resigned. \"It's had its time. I'll take the pay-off. There's not many long-term jobs left in the nuclear power industry.\" </p> <p>Next to the turnstiles where employees check their radiation levels, a row of leaflets about retirement and looking for work had been Sellotaped to the wall. Bradwell employs about 350 people, more than anyone else on the peninsula. Most of them are local: middle-aged men in overalls, used to the heat in the glassed-in corridors, taking coffee and cigarette breaks in the shadow of the reactors. The station has been shut for repairs so much recently they have almost run out of maintenance tasks. Fresh paint was drying on the floor of the doomed turbine hall. </p> <p>The goods lift to reactor one felt like the inside of an old battleship: metal panels, rivets, a reluctant creaking motion. The reactor itself, which was not generating, resembled a dug-up tennis court. Thick pieces of its concrete cap had been removed and scattered. The reactor's internal seals, great scuffed yellow rings, lay beached on the floor. A man wearing rubber boots and gloves but no facial protection was calmly, slowly, attending to one of them. Was there any risk involved? \"There's no airborne radiation,\" the guide said. But all around the reactor chamber, on the pipes and ledges and bakelite telephones, there was dust in feathery drifts. </p> <p>Bradwell's safety record is not bad by Sellafield standards. \"They're good, solid engineers,\" Mainwood admits. Yet ageing produces its problems. Between January and September 1999, according to the latest report from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, there were \"recurrent problems\" with Bradwell's electrical system; the \"discovery of debris\" in a fuel channel; \"apparently inadequately filtered liquid waste discharges into the estuary of the River Blackwater\"; and deficiencies identified in the station's \"emergency arrangements\" during an exercise simulating \"multiple casualties\". </p> <p>Such anxieties were unknown when Bradwell was first thought of. It was the early 50s, and the British government was preoccupied by fuel shortages and the cold war. Nuclear power appeared to offer a way both to outflank foreign blockades - or striking miners - and to acquire a vital strategic item: plutonium for bombs, a byproduct of uranium reactions. The electricity generated would be clean and cheap. Bradwell, the site of a second world war emergency airstrip for returning bombers, was safely isolated and close to water for cooling purposes. It was ideal for the next brave national endeavour. </p> <p>Construction began in 1957. For five years, rather longer than anticipated, concrete was poured and locals reassured and the reactors were coaxed towards operation. \"I used to watch those instruments in the control room,\" says Derek Smith, a commissioning engineer then, who had been hired from a traditional power station, \"and think, 'Are they ever going to move?'\" In 1962 Bradwell finally started generating commercially, beaten into second place in Britain, by half an hour, by another prototype station (now closed) at Berkeley in Gloucestershire. \"We did our testing more thoroughly,\" says Smith with a slight pout. </p> <p>The power plant brought apparent benefits to the peninsula. The pay was good. People swam in the warm water that Bradwell pumped into the river. Workers' houses were built in sleepy Southminster. The railway survived Dr Beeching's cuts, gaining a discreet siding for loading the waste flasks. A celebratory brochure was printed about Bradwell, with headings in electric orange. </p> <p>But behind its double ring of fences, the experiment had its rocky moments. On January 26, 1963, in the middle of that bitter winter, there was a power cut and the station's cooling system froze. Another engineer recorded in his diary: \"5am. Station shut down due to grid failure. Diesels didn't work. Essential supplies failure!!! Control room in darkness!\" None of the alarms sounded. The atmosphere inside the compound, for 15 minutes, was \"absolute mayhem\". Official confirmation of the incident didn't come until 1988. </p> <p>Regardless, for Bradwell's first six years, the staff managed to keep it continuously running. The station's long-term future was not much pondered: \"They just didn't realise that these things would need disposing of,\" Smith says. Then the stoppages began. The activity in the reactors, it became apparent, was making parts of the structure brittle. Each time cracks were found, the plant had to be closed - on top of the usual halts for maintenance. Steadily through the 70s and 80s, Bradwell gained a reputation for patch-ups and imperfections. </p> <p>Across the Blackwater in Wiven hoe, a village near Colchester, Mainwood started her campaign. She was a fretful CND veteran, worried about the local winds and radioactive dust and the wandering of polluted silt up the rivers and creeks. And as Bradwell began to struggle, she worried about its fragility: \"They have to warm the old girl up for 24 hours when they restart,\" she says, sounding almost affectionate. Then her open face tightens: \"We have to live through that.\" </p> <p>It was economics, though, as much as Mainwood's countless meetings and stunts by the gates (there was a satirical pantomime, and an attempted abseil), that did for Bradwell. It never produced the cheap electricity anticipated. When nuclear power was privatised in the late 80s, the state could not find buyers for the Magnox stations. With their suspect old technology, shrinking staffs and constant rebranding and changes of management, these stations have had a whiff of Rover about them ever since. </p> <p>But not to Derek Smith. He retired 10 years ago (\"arthritis\"), but he has not gone far: about 50 yards, in fact, to a small lichen-covered bungalow comically close to the looming grey towers. From his garden, Bradwell blocks out half the sky. The station has installed a radiation monitor on his garden shed. His apples have to be tested. </p> <p>Yet he looks over his specially-clipped hedge with pride. \"Even today... I marvel,\" he says, arms folded, a tousled and schoolboyish 65. \"The ideas are stunning. The mechanical soundness of that plant is astounding.\" At night, from his home stuffed with clocks and electrical gadgets and nuclear industry drinks mats, Smith relishes the sight of his hulking neighbour's floodlights. BNFL, for its own undeclared reasons, owns his bunga low and every other property and field for several miles around. The station's infra-red security cameras sweep his lawns. Smith breaks off from blaming \"the bloody Russians\" for the demise of nuclear power: \"I can't buy security like that!\" </p> <p>Bradwell, like the rest of the nuclear industry these days, is very keen on such small public relations coups. A nature trail has been planted around the station perimeter. There is a modern visitor centre, full of sly claims about atomic energy's environmental advantages - no greenhouse gases, it is claimed - over fossil fuel-burning power plants. An exhibit about the decommissioning of Bradwell is already in place. It shows the reactors stripped, smoothed into harmless-looking mounds and, after a century or so, disappearing altogether. </p> <p>Mainwood challenges this picture: \"People are going to be left with a nuclear waste dump.\" Yet she admits her views, formed in sheltered, relatively liberal Wivenhoe, have rarely gained much support out on the raw peninsula itself. There will be jobs in dismantling Bradwell as there have been in operating it. Local sailors use it as a landmark. And the fields around are already littered with old wartime pillboxes and sections of runway; perhaps the plant will crumble benignly into Dengie legend. Smith already refers mistily to \"when she goes down\". </p> <p>He points out the healthy-looking hares nibbling his lawn. The evening light softens the edges of the power station. But the next day, on the telephone, someone from BNFL confesses that there is no absolute guarantee of company money to clean up Bradwell. \"In the end, the government is the guarantor.\" Dignitaries may visit Bradwell again one day, in less optimistic circumstances than before.</p>",

His party's narrow escape from outright defeat in Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections bodes ill for his chances of clinging to power in the 2002 presidential ballot. And if it looks as if the voters plan to dump him, his own party may ditch him first.</p> <p>But just as the government's defeat in the referendum on constitutional reform in February alerted it to the level of voter discontent, so the parliamentary vote gives Mr Mugabe plenty of notice to hammer out a fresh strategy, legal or otherwise, to reverse his declining fortunes.</p> <p>The sweeping parliamentary gains by the Movement for Democratic Change will provide the opposition with a powerful springboard to end more than two decades of Mr Mugabe's increasingly abusive rule. Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC's leader, failed to win a seat but that may be to his advantage, as it frees him to concentrate on being the presumed opposition presidential candidate.</p> <p>If the MDC uses its considerable presence in parliament smartly during the next two years it will not only curtail the government's worst excesses but nail the official lie that there is little alternative to Zanu-PF's rule. The MDC can expose and curb corruption. It can press for real accountability by the police and military. It will also be able to circumvent the government's monopoly of the state media through the live broadcasts of parliamentary debates.</p> <p>Zanu-PF may decide that Mr Mugabe is too much of a liability when it holds its election post-mortem. After the government lost the referendum on constitutional reform earlier this year, which warned it of looming defeat in the parliamentary ballot and raised the stakes in the campaign against white farmers and Britain, some party leaders told Mr Mugabe to step down.</p> <p>He managed to stave off that attempt to unseat him, but the critics will be harder to silence this time. There are those who are keen to find another candidate for the 2002 election and to usher Mr Mugabe into the role of the elder statesman of independence.</p> <p>But there will still be many opportunities for him to make mischief. He may try to tempt the MDC into his government under the guise of national unity, while tainting his opponents with the flaws of his administration.</p> <p>The near defeat will probably encourage Mr Mugabe to press ahead with land reform in the belief that it will bring back some of the voters who defected to the MDC this week. That will keep the race issue alive, and the war veterans at his beck and call. But if he is to make political capital from the redistribution of white-owned farms it will have to be far more transparent and free of corruption than to date.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's unpopular involvement in the Congo war has also cost the ruling party support. The government has already said it will pull its troops out under the shaky peace deal, and Mr Mugabe will probably want to make sure that the whole episode is a distant memory by the time of the presidential election.</p> <p>The shock to Zanu-PF this week may yet save the party, particularly if it can find a suitable presidential candidate and the opposition fails to live up to expectations, or does what so many have done elsewhere in Africa and degenerates into a bickering, divided collection of self-serving politicians. For all Zanu-PF's shortcomings, there remains significant residual emotional support for the party that fought Ian Smith's minority regime.</p> <p>In the end, it may be that Zimbabweans come to look on the gradual erosion of its power as far better than the shock of sudden change. There has been violence and other outrages, but it has not been at a level to tear society apart.</p> <p>Ultimately, the referendum, parliamentary ballot and presidential election may be seen as a relatively smooth and stable transition from effective one-party rule to more representative and accountable government.</p> <p>But there is 2002 to get through first, and Mr Mugabe is not a man to give up easily.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Robert Mugabe is nothing if not forewarned. His party's narrow escape from outright defeat in Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections bodes ill for his chances of clinging to power in the 2002 presidential ballot. And if it looks as if the voters plan to dump him, his own party may ditch him first. But just as the government's defeat in the referendum on constitutional reform in February alerted it to the level of voter discontent, so the parliamentary vote gives Mr Mugabe plenty of notice to hammer out a fresh strategy, legal or otherwise, to reverse his declining fortunes. The sweeping parliamentary gains by the Movement for Democratic Change will provide the opposition with a powerful springboard to end more than two decades of Mr Mugabe's increasingly abusive rule. Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC's leader, failed to win a seat but that may be to his advantage, as it frees him to concentrate on being the presumed opposition presidential candidate. If the MDC uses its considerable presence in parliament smartly during the next two years it will not only curtail the government's worst excesses but nail the official lie that there is little alternative to Zanu-PF's rule. The MDC can expose and curb corruption. It can press for real accountability by the police and military. It will also be able to circumvent the government's monopoly of the state media through the live broadcasts of parliamentary debates. Zanu-PF may decide that Mr Mugabe is too much of a liability when it holds its election post-mortem. After the government lost the referendum on constitutional reform earlier this year, which warned it of looming defeat in the parliamentary ballot and raised the stakes in the campaign against white farmers and Britain, some party leaders told Mr Mugabe to step down. He managed to stave off that attempt to unseat him, but the critics will be harder to silence this time. There are those who are keen to find another candidate for the 2002 election and to usher Mr Mugabe into the role of the elder statesman of independence. But there will still be many opportunities for him to make mischief. He may try to tempt the MDC into his government under the guise of national unity, while tainting his opponents with the flaws of his administration. The near defeat will probably encourage Mr Mugabe to press ahead with land reform in the belief that it will bring back some of the voters who defected to the MDC this week. That will keep the race issue alive, and the war veterans at his beck and call. But if he is to make political capital from the redistribution of white-owned farms it will have to be far more transparent and free of corruption than to date. Zimbabwe's unpopular involvement in the Congo war has also cost the ruling party support. The government has already said it will pull its troops out under the shaky peace deal, and Mr Mugabe will probably want to make sure that the whole episode is a distant memory by the time of the presidential election. The shock to Zanu-PF this week may yet save the party, particularly if it can find a suitable presidential candidate and the opposition fails to live up to expectations, or does what so many have done elsewhere in Africa and degenerates into a bickering, divided collection of self-serving politicians. For all Zanu-PF's shortcomings, there remains significant residual emotional support for the party that fought Ian Smith's minority regime. In the end, it may be that Zimbabweans come to look on the gradual erosion of its power as far better than the shock of sudden change. There has been violence and other outrages, but it has not been at a level to tear society apart. Ultimately, the referendum, parliamentary ballot and presidential election may be seen as a relatively smooth and stable transition from effective one-party rule to more representative and accountable government. But there is 2002 to get through first, and Mr Mugabe is not a man to give up easily.",

The Foreign Office welcomed the achievement of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in going from almost a standing start to near parity with president Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. The hard line taken by Mr Hain in particular and by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, earlier this year saw heated exchanges between the countries. This led to criticism that the Foreign Office had played into Mr Mugabe's hands, allowing the president to present the election as a battle against British colonialism. Mr Hain rejected criticism of British tactics: \"I think the outcome is a complete vindication of the strong position that both I and Robin Cook took. The fact is that we have been dealing with a person since last year who has denounced the British prime minister as a gay gangster, who has brought his country to the point of economic collapse, who personally ordered the attacks on the opposition, who personally backed the land invasions, who did nothing about the violence that followed the campaign of terror which the government unleashed and who authorised the opening of our diplomatic bag in an unprecedented defiance of the Vienna convention. Mr Hain, who was brought up in South Africa and retains a strong interest in African affairs, said: \"If either I or Robin had adopted a weaker stand in the face of that kind of belligerence, we would have been accused of weakness.\" He added that Zimbabweans, at least where they were free from intimidation, had voted on the basis of hunger and jobs rather than the exchange of rhetoric between Britain and Mr Mugabe. During the election campaign, the British government deliberately adopted a low profile, in contrast with previous months. Mr Cook had been in touch with the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, several times during the campaign and he had said he was happy with that approach. Mr Cook called on Mr Mugabe to accept the mood for change and urged Zanu-PF to respond positively to an offer from the opposition to discuss how they can work together for the people of Zimbabwe. A \u00a336m aid package previously offered by Britain to assist land reform was still on the table if this cooperation was forthcoming, he said. But he warned Mr Mugabe that if he failed to work with the opposition on policies to tackle Zimbabwe's deep economic crisis and to restore the rule of law, the cash would be withheld. The Conservative foreign affairs spokesman, Francis Maude, also welcomed the result: \"This election drives a stake through the heart of Mugabe's claim to represent the legitimate will of the Zimbabwe people.\" The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, described it as a \"stunning result\". South Africa's ruling African National Congress described Mr Mugabe's win as evidence that democracy was taking root in the country and Africa. The South African president, Thabo Mbeke, has been left in a difficult position by the Zimbabwe crisis. He did not want to be seen to be critical of a neighbouring country, especially where the issue was land owned by white farmers. The ANC said: \"We congratulate Zanu-PF on their victory as we realise that the election process has underscored the fact that democracy is taking root not only in Zimbabwe but in the sub-region and, indeed, in the whole of Africa.\" The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, said parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe should be respected in spite of reports by observers that they could have been tainted by pre-election violence and threats.",

But his more immediate task is to convince the left to campaign for him.</p> <p>Last week, his campaign received an unexpected endorsement when the Teamsters union leader, James Hoffa, appeared publicly with Mr Nader and said that it was vital that he was on the presidential ballot in November. \"No one speaks stronger on the issues important to American families than Ralph Nader,\" said Mr Hoffa.</p> <p>Mr Hoffa's intervention signalled to the Democrats and their presidential hopeful, Vice-President Al Gore, that if some of their traditional backers fall in behind Mr Nader, they could suffer serious damage in a close race with the Republicans.</p> <p>Equally, the Republicans and their contender, Mr Bush, will be watching to see how the Reform party candidate Pat Buchanan fares as conservatives could drift from Mr Bush to Mr Buchanan if they think he is making any headway; currently he is polling well below Mr Nader.</p> <p>The mantra of Al Gore's supporters is, \"A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\".

      "bodyText": "New opinion polls indicate that Ralph Nader, confirmed this week as the Green party's presidential candidate, could play a crucial part in November's US election. With George W Bush and Al Gore neck and neck, the 7% showing for Mr Nader has provoked a debate on the left about whether supporting him may leach away some Democratic support and help Mr Bush and the Republicans. The American Green party had gathered at the weekend in Denver, Colorado, for a convention which its members hoped would be the prelude to a campaign that would finally put the party on the political map. As the Greens' candidate in the 1996 election, Mr Nader won 700,000 votes - less than 1% of the vote - but the party is hoping for a much more substantial showing this time. \"The two major parties are not only run on the same well worn set of ideas but their campaigns are funded by millions of dollars provided by the same corporate interests,\" Mr Nader said. He called the Gore-Bush contest \"the drab against the dreary\". The Green party now has organisations in 29 states and has 79 political office-holders nationally. In Texas it was confirmed last week that 74,000 people, nearly double the 40,000 required, had endorsed the party to ensure its place on the presidential ballot. The party is strongest in California where there are 31 office-holders. In New Mexico, one of its candidates, Carol Miller, got 17% of the vote in the last congressional election. Four years ago Mr Nader, now 66, was accused of running a lacklustre campaign. This time he plans to seek votes outside the party's obvious constituency and campaign in all 50 states. He earned his title of \"consumer advocate\" 35 years ago when he exposed the failings of the motor industry and there are now plans to film his book, Unsafe At Any Speed, which catalogues his challenge to one of the country's most powerful lobbies. But his more immediate task is to convince the left to campaign for him. Last week, his campaign received an unexpected endorsement when the Teamsters union leader, James Hoffa, appeared publicly with Mr Nader and said that it was vital that he was on the presidential ballot in November. \"No one speaks stronger on the issues important to American families than Ralph Nader,\" said Mr Hoffa. Mr Hoffa's intervention signalled to the Democrats and their presidential hopeful, Vice-President Al Gore, that if some of their traditional backers fall in behind Mr Nader, they could suffer serious damage in a close race with the Republicans. Equally, the Republicans and their contender, Mr Bush, will be watching to see how the Reform party candidate Pat Buchanan fares as conservatives could drift from Mr Bush to Mr Buchanan if they think he is making any headway; currently he is polling well below Mr Nader. The mantra of Al Gore's supporters is, \"A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush\". Yesterday Mr Nader said: \"People ask me if I'm worried about taking votes away from Gore. I'm worried about Gore taking votes away from me.\" His vice-presidential running mate is Winona LaDuke, a Native American activist educated at Harvard. Her speeches have concentrated on poverty, urban decay, civil rights and disparity of income while Mr Nader leads on the issues of globalisation, corporate power, media monopolies, blue-collar jobs, consumer rights and the environment. Although sometimes accused of lacking sufficient charisma to mount a serious challenge to the main parties, Mr Nader has been entertaining gatherings this year with witty and biting speeches, mocking the local media's political coverage and the compromises made by the main candidates to accommodate their backers. Mr Nader's own finances came under scrutiny last week when he opened his accounts and was shown to have assets worth $3.9m (\u00a32.6m). He said he normally gave 80% of his earnings - $512,000 in the previous 16 months from speaking engagements - to civic causes. Mr Nader, who lives in Washington, does not own a car or property. The Green party campaign received a setback last week when the commission on presidential debates confirmed its decision to deny Mr Nader and Pat Buchanan a place in televised prime-time debates during the campaign, on the grounds that they had taken less than 15% of the vote in national opinion polls. Mr Nader has responded by filing a civil law suit arguing that those who stage the debates, which cost around $550,000, are making illegal contributions to the Democrats and Republicans because of the publicity the debates will give them.",

      "body": "<p>While spring-cleaning my study last week, I found a newspaper dated November 4 1999. \"Awesome foursome turn \u00a35m into \u00a3600m overnight,\" a front-page headline announced. The foursome consisted of the Tory MP Archie Norman and three business colleagues. They had achieved their alchemy by buying 247.5m shares at 2p each in Knutsford, a small leather company in Cheshire whose total assets were worth little more than \u00a35m. On the first day of the new regime the share price rose to 232p, giving Norman a paper profit of about \u00a350m on his \u00a3500,000 investment and valuing Knutsford at \u00a3600m - more than Storehouse, the owner of BhS and Mothercare.</p> <p>Ah yes, I remember it well. But, as they say on A Question of Sport, what happened next? The brief history of Knutsford is a most illuminating fable of hype and hogwash, and a useful cautionary tale for those who - like our present government - believe that \"the market\" is the most wise and rational economic mechanism ever devised, rather than a mad carousel driven by greed and fear.</p> <p><b> November 1999: </b> The amazing overnight rise in Knutsford's valuation sets a new stock market record. A company spokeswoman attributes it to investors' expectation that Norman and his three chums will soon buy a high street retailer. \"This is a dream team,\" she says, \"and it is no secret they are going big time with this one.\" Though no target has yet been identified, rumour suggests that they may bid for Marks &amp; Spencer - or indeed Storehouse.</p> <p>The City pages can hardly contain their excitement. The Express hails \"the modern-day buccaneers, the men with the Midas touch, the colossi of the financial world\". In a postscript, it admits that \"so far [Knutsford] has done nothing at all but, as ever with the stock market, much depends on smoke and mirrors\".</p> <p><b> January 2000: </b> There is speculation galore about which retail giant will be taken over: House of Fraser, MFI, Allders, the Co-op, Great Universal Stores, Somerfield, Sainsbury's and Boots are all mentioned. The Knutsford team \"may be close to identifying a target\". On January 18 the foursome announce an all-shares bid for Wassall, an industrial conglomerate. Twelve days later they pull out, blaming the greed of Wassall's shareholders. As a Knutsford spokesman complains: \"Wassall shareholders have been in this stock for a long time and a lot of them want cash.\" So it's back to Plan A: \"We are now going to do what we have always said we would do, which is to acquire an underperforming retail group.\" An announcement is promised by March.</p> <p><b> February 2000: </b> Norman is appointed shadow environment secretary but refuses to relinquish his 10% stake in Knutsford. If he does become the part-owner of a supermarket chain, how will he be able to speak on such subjects as greenfield development without a conflict of interest? Answer comes there none.</p> <p><b> May 2000: </b> Hold the front page! \"Knutsford is in talks to make its first acquisition, it emerged last night.\" The company says it is negotiating with \"a privately owned investor-relations business operating in Europe and North America regarding a possible takeover\".</p> <p><b> June 2000: </b> Last month's carefully worded statement neglected to mention who was taking over whom. Far from making its first acquisition, we now learn, Knutsford has reached its last gasp. It is disappearing into the small American company WILink.com, which is run by property tycoon Nigel Wray, a schoolfriend of one of the awesome foursome. Knutsford's share-price tumbles from 80p to 22p.</p> <p>The awesome foursome, who until recently bestrode the City like a \u00a3690m colossus, have become the winsome losesome. Disgruntled investors who bought into the company at 200p recall what Norman said last November: \"My whole track record is making money for people and I don't want to let them down.\" Having paid just 2p each for his own shares, he is still showing a handsome profit. Quite what he has done to earn it remains a mystery.</p> <p><b>Mo, the Mail and palace poppycock</b><br> Hegel says somewhere that all important events and characters in world history occur twice. He forgot to add that the same is true of silly-season news in the Daily Mail. Hence the screaming front-page headline yesterday, \"MO'S ATTACK ON THE QUEEN\", which bears an uncanny resemblance to a story from August 1994. Then as now, Mo Mowlam didn't attack the Queen at all, suggesting merely that the royal family ought to abandon Buckingham Palace and move into a \"good modern building\".</p> <p>The Mail, which describes Mowlam's interview with Saga magazine as a \"constitutional bombshell\", apparently regards royal residences as sacred relics. As it commented last time around, Buckingham Palace \"is inseparable from our history, our nationhood and, most importantly, our constitution\".</p> <p>What poppycock. Like so much of the \"historic\" pageantry and paraphernalia that surround the royals, the palace is actually quite modern. The first monarch to live there was Queen Victoria - and she moved out again after the death of Prince Albert in 1861, leaving it empty for the next 40 years. (In 1864 a notice was pinned to the railings: \"These commanding premises to be let or sold, in consequence of the late inhabitant's declining business.\") Since then, several hideous additions - notably the Portland stone facade, which replaced John Nash's east front in 1913 - have made it the ugliest building in London. Like most of its occupants, Buckingham Palace is an undignified embarrassment.</p> <p>Mowlam tells Saga magazine that although she's \"not a great fan of the monarchy\" she likes Prince Charles and finds the Queen \"very pleasant\". All this was known six years ago. So why the hysteria now? Allow the Mail to explain: \"Yesterday's interview in Saga magazine indicates her views have not changed.\"</p> <p>A politician who says the same when in government as in opposition, eh? No wonder Mo's cabinet colleagues are reported to be shocked and appalled by her \"bombshell\".</p> <p>\u0095 Now that the first rough map of the human genome has been completed, I hope that a few Nobel-hungry scientists will take on the far more difficult project of mapping William Hague's brain.</p> <p>Here's what we know so far. He has a low opinion of the government in which he served, so much so that his front bench now has only three people (himself included) who sat in the Major cabinet. Does he hark back to the Thatcher years? Not really: he is, for example, scathing about the Blessed Margaret's failure to \"do anything\" about law and order throughout the 1980s. His attitude towards asylum seekers leads one to wonder if he's a Powellite, but he is quick to deny any such allegiance.</p> <p>What, then, do those Hagueite chromosomes add up to? He claims to be a cuddly, modern Conservative who approves of gay marriages; yet he sits respectfully at the feet of a loopy American creationist who regards homosexuality as the devil's own work. He is fervently opposed to the very principle of a European single currency, for all the usual reasons concerning loss of economic sovereignty; yet he leaves open the possibility that a Hague government might join the euro after the next election but one. He seems genuinely proud of his shadow ministers, apparently convinced that they have the same elegance and talent as the Dutch football side; yet a glance at the team-sheet reveals a shadow cabinet stuffed with no-hopers - Angela Browning, Gary Streeter, Theresa May, Andrew Mackay, Archie Norman - who would be lucky to make the Accrington Stanley 3rd XI.</p> <p>To all appearances, the man is a hopelessly confused nitwit.

Earlier this week, referring to the Human Genome Project, a Guardian editorial warned that \"no one knows the language and no one has the dictionary.

It will be many, many years before we have begun to understand...\" The same can be said of the attempt to explain the appeal of William Hague - or, as it will soon be known, the Inhuman Gnome Project.",

The opening moments, with a performing space lit by naked bulbs and a flow of sand falling over a still performer, suggest gravity, but, alas, the need to crack jokes soon takes over.

Later in the proceedings, when she was revealed as her (female) lodger's probable lover, she sported animal-print pyjamas and a huge shaggy mane of hair, the nocturnal wardrobe of femmes fatales the world over. </p> <p>It was when Lawrence was not there to vamp it up that the trouble began. Alan Davies, as accidental adulterer Russel, stumbled well-meaningly through the sex ual minefield, quietly proud of the fact that his mistress Elly (Kate Ashfield) and his wife Susanna (Simone Bendix) had coaxed four orgasms out of him in a day. He was surprised; the rest of us were incredulous. The entire show was predicated on the fact that you find Davies irresistible, and if you don't, Newsnight began to seem strangely appealing. For the first 10 minutes Davies was unable to keep his clothes on, hopping in and out of beds and showers, having sex in all the basic positions and even at one point receiving oral pleasure from his (male) agent in a dream sequence. This kind of behaviour is understandable in any drama starring Robson Green, Clive Owen or Gary Mavers, who really project better without clothes. In the case of Davies, however, each unrobing could only be greeted with hearty cries of \"get 'em on!\" </p> <p>The subject matter was agreeably raunchy for BBC1, and it's always good to hear lines about ejaculation and cottaging, even if they're not terribly funny. And there was the rub: we waited in vain for the laughs to come. But instead of jokes there were remarks like \"that is some scary shit\" and \"I may be married, but at least I've got a cock\". At one point, Elly looked hard at Russel and said \"That isn't funny\", which was a risky move. Occasionally Russel had visions of the Ally McBeal variety, in which he imagined himself smashing his agent over the head with a giant hammer, a device which sat awkwardly with the rest of the fare. </p> <p>Things perked up a bit when Russel went for dinner in a posh restaurant with his gay best friend Luis (Victor McGuire) and became convinced that the waiter thought he was \"the bitch\". Luis, as the gay best friend, should have provided some light relief, but bucked the trend of sitcom homosexuals by being dull and sensible. Russel ended the show lying semi-conscious in a stream of dog piss, and so we can only hope that things improve in the coming weeks. </p> <p>ITV's Real Life strand returned with The Gay Dads, a warts-and-all portrait of Barrie Drewitt and Tony Barlow, the Essex millionaires who made headlines last year by becoming parents of twins through a surrogate mother. Andrew Webb's cameras were with them throughout the pregnancy and birth, and through the ghastly post-natal farce in which the Home Office attempted to prevent the babies from staying in Britain. After putting Drewitt and Barlow through hell and effectively souring the joy of fatherhood, the Home Secretary backed down just three days before the deadline and allowed little Aspen and Saffron to stay put. </p> <p>More interesting than this well-documented political blunder, however, was the insight offered into the Drewitt-Barlow m\u00e9nage. They came across at first as stock types: Barrie in his silly micro-fibre hat looking like a reject from East 17, Tony all inarticulate butchness and button-down collars. As the film wound on, however, they emerged from the fa\u00e7ade as a serious-minded pair, hurt by the misrepresentation of their predicament and righteously angry at the way they were being criminalised. \"People are saying the children will have no female influence in their lives\", laughed Barlow, as he welcomed the extended family for a visit - seldom has such a collection of strong-minded women been seen in one place at the same time. Even the grandparents-to-be waxed lyrical about the love between their sons. </p> <p>Ten years ago, this kind of sympathetic coverage on ITV would have been unthinkable. \"A sign of the times, or a threat to the family as we know it?\" asked the voice-over at the beginning of the film, but there was never any doubt as to the answer.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 1941, with bombs falling on London and nation's survival looking doubtful, George Orwell sat down to write about gardening. His essay The Lion and the Unicorn is an analysis of the British national character - written at a time when Britain and England were considered to be one and the same - that concludes with a plea for socialists to love their country. </p> <p>\"Here are a couple of generalisations about England that would be accepted by just about everybody,\" noted Orwell without fear of contradiction. \"One is that the English are not gifted artistically.\" Instead of great art they have \"a love of flowers... We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp collectors, pigeon fanciers, amateur carpenters, darts players, crossword puzzle fans.\" </p> <p>Orwell's judgment on British art has finally been vindicated by an unlikely authority: Tate Britain. Flower arrangements by members of the Women's Institute are among the exhibits in Intelligence, a survey show of contemporary British art opening there next week that also features art stars such as Douglas Gordon, Tacita Dean and Susan Hiller. The flower arranging has been organised by artists Jeremy Deller and Alan Kane as part of their Folk Archive, a collection of folk art from around Britain that also includes images of a pipe-smoking competition at Egremont Crab Fair, gurning world champion Tommy Mattinson, Morris dancers, Diana tributes, obscene garden decorations and - displayed at the Tate in all its straw-stuffed glory - a scarecrow. </p> <p>Folk Archive is a neat image of what this new museum of national British art feels like. Tate Britain feels like stepping into a folk song, an old ballad, and encountering homely images we thought we had left behind. Green hills and fairies, Stonehenge, the red-coated soldiers who hold the Union Jack aloft in John Singleton Copley's painting The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781 - depicting the patriotic martyrdom of the young officer who liberated Jersey from a French invasion - are what you see in this museum. But do we want to see those things? </p> <p>Some days are better than others, but Tate Britain's curators have had to endure a huge reduction in visitor figures since the opening of Tate Modern, which has already clocked up 1m visitors in only six weeks. When Tate Britain was launched in April it had 162,000 visitors in a month; when Tate Modern opened it sent the next month's figures plummeting to 99,000, and so far, virtually at the end of the month, the June figure is 60,000. When I met the museum's director, Stephen Deuchar, recently he made no secret of his anxieties about the museum's role. </p> <p>Tate Britain has had vicious reviews for its opening displays, which reject chronology in favour of themes like Private and Public and Home and Abroad. It's true that some of the juxtapositions of artists from different periods are amazingly silly - do we really gain anything by seeing Gilbert and George in the same room as LS Lowry because they're both \"urban\"? - but it is not that badly curated. Lots of rooms, such as the one exploring images of war from The Death of Major Peirson to Jacob Epstein's The Rock Drill (1913-14), are fascinating. But this is not why people are not visiting the museum. This is not about individual works of art, but how we see ourselves. </p> <p>It's incredibly hard to read the mood of Britain at the beginning of the 21st century. Tate Modern on the one hand, soccer violence on the other. We have certainly disproved the old stereotype of the British as moderate and dull. The sudden rush of visual images and visual pleasure in Britain, the total abandonment of our old staid \"character\", is full of violent contradictions. When George Orwell analysed the British character in The Lion and the Unicorn he said that, in compensation for our lack of artistic excellence, we had fortitude and loyalty and no real nationalist or racist hatred for others. Today we seem to have the capacity for both. So while it would be nice to say that our lack of interest in Tate Britain is a triumph of modernity over nationhood, things are not so clear. What does it mean that our national art heritage is being stepped around in the road like a dead bulldog? </p> <p>Folk Archive's intervention makes the best argument I have seen so far for this museum. It's not just that getting the stripping, Blair-bashing cohorts of the WI to contribute to an exhibition of contemporary art will bring the beleaguered Tate Britain some press attention. Folk Archive is a reading of this institution, an interpretation of it. The artists hold up Tate Britain as an anthropological phenomenon and invite you to see our national collection of British painting and sculpture in the same way we see flower arranging when it is framed here - not ironically so much as ethnographically. What a strange activity it is to make a scarecrow, or gurn; what a strange activity to collect works of art that embody \"Britishness\". </p> <p>Jeremy Deller, an artist who specialises in anthropological investigations of contemporary British culture, has touched on this stuff before. He once did an artwork collecting \"middle-class hand signals\" by which the middle class of the home counties purportedly know one another. This time he has excelled himself with a comprehensive anthology of everything that is archaic, unruly and plain odd in British culture. Folk Archive is a model for what Tate Britain might be. Artists, unlike the general public, are very interested in this museum precisely because it's a bit hard to get your head around, all this old British art. We're so far removed now from the rural culture that produced Stubbs's paintings of horses or Gainsborough's rustic portraits that they can be rediscovered as images of Britishness strangely at odds with how we now see ourselves. </p> <p>At first sight, the unpopularity of Tate Britain looks like proof that we have become a modern European nation. We want all the cosmopolitan wonders at Tate Modern, and we couldn't give a damn, apparently, about all those old canvases by Hogarth and Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites and the Bloomsbury group. Just as it turned out that the famously pub-loving British were waiting for some nice continental-style bars to open so we could get out of those smelly old pubs, so it turns out we were just waiting for a decent modern art museum to open so we could get away from all those figurative paintings. </p> <p>But it's one thing to reject conservative taste, quite another to forget your history. One of the feeblest attractions at the Dome is the Self-Portrait Zone, which is full of little homilies about how wonderful Britain is, saying things like \"We have a good sense of humour\", but without any sense of history or things British people might actually want to remember, like enduring the blitz, a history that is marked on the landscape beside the Thames yet finds no mention in the Dome. </p> <p>Tate Britain is a necessary corrective to our infatuation with now. It has the makings of a really eccentric museum, and they are the best kind. What it contains is our folk art - our collective depository of myths and images, which we can all feed our imaginations on. Folk Archive is a key to this museum's strange, secret world of British cultural history. Tate Britain is full of images straight out of a folk song. Here is Richard Dadd's painting of the fairy folk, done when he was in Bedlam for murdering his father; here is William Hogarth's painting of the mythic highwayman Macheath, from John Gay's 18th-century play with ballads The Beggar's Opera. Visiting Tate Britain is like listening to folk music - you could start to enjoy it. </p> <p>Folk art is politically ambiguous. British art from the past is fiercely patriotic, from the nobly shed blood of Major Peirson to William Hogarth's painting of starving Frenchies and Jacobites looking with longing at the Roast Beef of Old England. But there's also a savage satire in this art, that is not opposed to its patriotism but a part of it. Hogarth's love of Old England is a love of a plebeian, urban crowd exploited and manipulated by aristocracy and corrupt government: his relish of popular British habits - the boozing, whoring, rioting and fist-fighting that is \"Hogarthian\" - is a rejection of the narrower, politer, more restrained Englishness you get in Reynolds's portraits of the aristocracy. Hogarth's appetite for a robust, subversive popular culture runs through old British art: satirical printmakers like Gillray dredged up scabrous, ambivalent images straight from the national unconscious, again all patriotism as they attack the French Revolution but at the same time full of disgust at Britain's bloated, corrupt rulers. </p> <p>\"The genuinely popular culture of England is something that goes on beneath the surface, unofficially and more or less frowned on by the authorities,\" wrote Orwell in The Lion and the Unicorn, but it has surfaced time and again in British art. You can see it in William Blake's channelling of 18th-century sectarian beliefs into an alternative British cosmology - to be celebrated in a big Blake show at Tate Britain later this year. You can see it in Henry Fuseli's transformation of popular superstitions into his nightmarishly surreal painting of Titania and Bottom from A Midsummer Night's Dream, in which the fairy folk are not cute but sinister. </p> <p>The danger with Britain's love affair with modern art is that we risk repressing all this. Tate Modern is an austerely seductive image of the new. But Tate Britain makes me think of \"rough music\", the aggressive rituals the rural poor used to perform to punish enemies of the people. This could mean an ugly assault on the different, those who disobey the community's rules. But it could also mean rioting against rulers. If a new, modern Britain represses the weirdness that still exists in our popular culture, it will haunt us in ugly and authoritarian ways. And we have no excuse for underestimating the savage strangeness of the British: the evidence is laid out for us to study at the museum of British folk art. </p> <p>\u0095 Intelligence is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), from July 6 to September 24.</p>",

It's true that some of the juxtapositions of artists from different periods are amazingly silly - do we really gain anything by seeing Gilbert and George in the same room as LS Lowry because they're both \"urban\"? - but it is not that badly curated. Lots of rooms, such as the one exploring images of war from The Death of Major Peirson to Jacob Epstein's The Rock Drill (1913-14), are fascinating. But this is not why people are not visiting the museum. This is not about individual works of art, but how we see ourselves. It's incredibly hard to read the mood of Britain at the beginning of the 21st century. Tate Modern on the one hand, soccer violence on the other. We have certainly disproved the old stereotype of the British as moderate and dull. The sudden rush of visual images and visual pleasure in Britain, the total abandonment of our old staid \"character\", is full of violent contradictions. When George Orwell analysed the British character in The Lion and the Unicorn he said that, in compensation for our lack of artistic excellence, we had fortitude and loyalty and no real nationalist or racist hatred for others. Today we seem to have the capacity for both. So while it would be nice to say that our lack of interest in Tate Britain is a triumph of modernity over nationhood, things are not so clear. What does it mean that our national art heritage is being stepped around in the road like a dead bulldog? Folk Archive's intervention makes the best argument I have seen so far for this museum. It's not just that getting the stripping, Blair-bashing cohorts of the WI to contribute to an exhibition of contemporary art will bring the beleaguered Tate Britain some press attention. Folk Archive is a reading of this institution, an interpretation of it. The artists hold up Tate Britain as an anthropological phenomenon and invite you to see our national collection of British painting and sculpture in the same way we see flower arranging when it is framed here - not ironically so much as ethnographically. What a strange activity it is to make a scarecrow, or gurn; what a strange activity to collect works of art that embody \"Britishness\". Jeremy Deller, an artist who specialises in anthropological investigations of contemporary British culture, has touched on this stuff before. He once did an artwork collecting \"middle-class hand signals\" by which the middle class of the home counties purportedly know one another. This time he has excelled himself with a comprehensive anthology of everything that is archaic, unruly and plain odd in British culture. Folk Archive is a model for what Tate Britain might be. Artists, unlike the general public, are very interested in this museum precisely because it's a bit hard to get your head around, all this old British art. We're so far removed now from the rural culture that produced Stubbs's paintings of horses or Gainsborough's rustic portraits that they can be rediscovered as images of Britishness strangely at odds with how we now see ourselves. At first sight, the unpopularity of Tate Britain looks like proof that we have become a modern European nation. We want all the cosmopolitan wonders at Tate Modern, and we couldn't give a damn, apparently, about all those old canvases by Hogarth and Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites and the Bloomsbury group. Just as it turned out that the famously pub-loving British were waiting for some nice continental-style bars to open so we could get out of those smelly old pubs, so it turns out we were just waiting for a decent modern art museum to open so we could get away from all those figurative paintings. But it's one thing to reject conservative taste, quite another to forget your history. One of the feeblest attractions at the Dome is the Self-Portrait Zone, which is full of little homilies about how wonderful Britain is, saying things like \"We have a good sense of humour\", but without any sense of history or things British people might actually want to remember, like enduring the blitz, a history that is marked on the landscape beside the Thames yet finds no mention in the Dome. Tate Britain is a necessary corrective to our infatuation with now. It has the makings of a really eccentric museum, and they are the best kind. What it contains is our folk art - our collective depository of myths and images, which we can all feed our imaginations on. Folk Archive is a key to this museum's strange, secret world of British cultural history. Tate Britain is full of images straight out of a folk song. Here is Richard Dadd's painting of the fairy folk, done when he was in Bedlam for murdering his father; here is William Hogarth's painting of the mythic highwayman Macheath, from John Gay's 18th-century play with ballads The Beggar's Opera. Visiting Tate Britain is like listening to folk music - you could start to enjoy it. Folk art is politically ambiguous. British art from the past is fiercely patriotic, from the nobly shed blood of Major Peirson to William Hogarth's painting of starving Frenchies and Jacobites looking with longing at the Roast Beef of Old England. But there's also a savage satire in this art, that is not opposed to its patriotism but a part of it. Hogarth's love of Old England is a love of a plebeian, urban crowd exploited and manipulated by aristocracy and corrupt government: his relish of popular British habits - the boozing, whoring, rioting and fist-fighting that is \"Hogarthian\" - is a rejection of the narrower, politer, more restrained Englishness you get in Reynolds's portraits of the aristocracy. Hogarth's appetite for a robust, subversive popular culture runs through old British art: satirical printmakers like Gillray dredged up scabrous, ambivalent images straight from the national unconscious, again all patriotism as they attack the French Revolution but at the same time full of disgust at Britain's bloated, corrupt rulers. \"The genuinely popular culture of England is something that goes on beneath the surface, unofficially and more or less frowned on by the authorities,\" wrote Orwell in The Lion and the Unicorn, but it has surfaced time and again in British art. You can see it in William Blake's channelling of 18th-century sectarian beliefs into an alternative British cosmology - to be celebrated in a big Blake show at Tate Britain later this year. You can see it in Henry Fuseli's transformation of popular superstitions into his nightmarishly surreal painting of Titania and Bottom from A Midsummer Night's Dream, in which the fairy folk are not cute but sinister. The danger with Britain's love affair with modern art is that we risk repressing all this. Tate Modern is an austerely seductive image of the new. But Tate Britain makes me think of \"rough music\", the aggressive rituals the rural poor used to perform to punish enemies of the people. This could mean an ugly assault on the different, those who disobey the community's rules. But it could also mean rioting against rulers. If a new, modern Britain represses the weirdness that still exists in our popular culture, it will haunt us in ugly and authoritarian ways. And we have no excuse for underestimating the savage strangeness of the British: the evidence is laid out for us to study at the museum of British folk art. \u0095 Intelligence is at Tate Britain, London SW1 (020-7887 8008), from July 6 to September 24.",

      "body": "<p>Fame is no insulation against pain. Donald Sutherland last week wrote a wounded piece in the Times recording his personal devastation at the reviews for Enigmatic Variations, in which he is playing at the Savoy Theatre. Referring to one particularly cruel jibe, he invoked the grief of a bereaved father and the agony of Ethel Rosenberg in the electric chair before suggesting he had no desire to live. More philosophically, Kelsey Grammer - TV's Frasier - greeted the critical drubbing of his Broadway Macbeth, which closed after 10 days at a loss of $1.5m, by saying, \"I'm not going to moan about it. I'll cram something else down their throats in another couple of years.\" </p> <p>So are critics vindictive Torquemadas delighting in cruelty, as Sutherland would have us believe? Or are they simply plain-speakers who, in the course of their job, inevitably inflict pain? Before answering that, I would say I have some sympathy with the soul-scorched Sutherland. </p> <p>Three years back I had the temerity to direct a couple of plays in Battersea as part of a critics' season. One evening I turned up at the theatre to find an actress, who had loyally followed my instructions, shell-shocked by a lacerating review from the RSC's Adrian Noble. She was - and is - an excellent actress. But it took a lot of persuasion to undo the damage inflicted by a piece of casual abuse. It also brought home to me - this was soon after Stephen Fry had taken flight to Bruges after bad reviews for Simon Gray's Cell Mates - the volatile precariousness of the performer. </p> <p>For all that, I believe Sutherland's argument rests on a shaky premise. \"Surely,\" he writes, \"the responsibility of the theatre reviewer is to the theatre audience. To report how they responded to the play, to reflect the audience's reaction.\" Absolutely not. The critic's prime responsibility is to his or her conscience and vision of the truth. Indeed, I suspect Sutherland is being faux-na\u00eff . He knows, as well as I do, that commercial managements pack first-night houses with backers, friends and claqueurs; to report their partial reaction would be pointless and counter-productive. What Sutherland may not know is that someone else once advocated criticism be replaced by reporting. Rather than be concerned with values, he said, \"it should confine itself to description which would give the public the right to make up its own mind\". His name, unfortunately, was Joseph Goebbels. </p> <p>The critic is not a straw-poll merchant, a tipster or a second-guesser of audience taste, simply an individual paid to record his or her reaction. Throughout history this has been a source of creative tension between artists and critics. What I believe is distorting that relationship at present is the gradual shift towards a PR-led culture. Before any major film, play, musical or book is launched, there is now a barrage of pre-publicity in every available medium. Artists are wooed, cossetted, persuaded to bang the interview drum. Criticism, when it arrives, is consequently regarded as a form of belated impertinence, a spoiler at the publicity feast. I was amused, not long ago, to be introduced at a public forum as \"the critic who didn't like The Lion King\". I was made to feel like the man in a Bateman cartoon notorious for his solitary perversity. </p> <p>Sutherland's notion of the critic as a neutral mediator between artist and public also ignores the economic factor. This surfaced some years back when Simon Gray and I were both on a radio programme after one of his plays had been harshly received. Gray, a civilised man, pointed out that a dramatist feels as protective towards a new play as a mother to her new-born child and is as fiercely resentful of criticism. \"It's as if,\" he said, \"you'd taken your baby out in the pram and people came along and poked their noses inside and asked why you couldn't have made the leg a bit longer or the arm a bit shorter.\" I couldn't help pointing out that mothers rarely charge people \u00a330 a head to view their baby. A play is a public event that it costs money to attend - hence the need for external assessment. </p> <p>But are critics out of touch with popular taste? Is there a growing gulf between opinion-mongers and audiences? Possibly so - especially in the field of musicals. No critic warmed to The Sound of Music; the rest is history. Les Mis\u00e9rables got tepid overnight reviews; the rest is hysteria. And, having trashed Notre-Dame de Paris, I was intrigued to get a letter inviting me to meet its composer and attend another performance where I would find it playing to a packed and ecstatic audience. I politely declined, not because I believe critics are invincibly right but simply because Notre-Dame represents a trend - towards the over-amplified, characterless musical - that I personally dislike. I've said my piece. The public is now free to make up its own mind. </p> <p>Of course, critics can be blinkered, egotistic, smugly protective of their own prejudices; but so too can artists. What we all need is to be more open about our mistakes. Years ago I remember being wheeled out on television the day after the disastrous opening of Jeeves, the initial version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Alan Ayckbourn musical that got appalling reviews. The interviewer turned to Eric Thompson, who had directed it, and asked, \"Did the critics kill the show?\" With impeccable honesty, the saintly Thompson replied, \"No, the show killed the show.\" It's the only time in my life I've ever heard anyone admit that. </p> <p>What we need, if theatre is to survive, is not the kind of neutered-tom, reportorial criticism Sutherland advocates. I don't suppose he'd be any too pleased if one announced that one's own enthusiasm was clearly not shared by a restless, fidgety, bored-out-of-their-skull audience. What one needs is criticism that is lively, informed, impassioned and capable of measuring the theatre we have against a platonic ideal of the one we'd like to have. In the process one may cause pain. But, as Eric Bentley once said, that is the price one pays for the right to practise the profession: \"For the journalist-critic the only alternative to a sharp tongue is a mealy mouth.\" </p> <p>At the moment theatre criticism is not an easy occupation in Britain: it has to contend with the oily workings of the PR machine, an increasingly consumerist society and what Robert Hughes once called \"the psychotic cult of celebrity\". But at least things are infinitely better than in New York. We have a plurality of opinion and a diverse theatre; in New York there is a direct correlation between the awesome power of the New York Times and the bland sterility of Broadway. In New York Kelsey Grammer's Macbeth didn't stand a chance once it had been given the official thumbs-down. In London Donald Sutherland, however much he may despise us rude scribblers, is still in there fighting and proving the power of the critic is provisional rather than absolute. Instead of baring his wounds, perhaps he should count his blessings. </p> <p> <strong> Some of the cruellest remarks about Donald Sutherland's play...</strong> </p> <p><strong> Financial Times:</strong> Everything about Enigmatic Variations is foolish: the ill-advised decision of the film actor Donald Sutherland to use this as the vehicle to bring him to the West End stage, the weak performance of his co-actor John Rubinstein, and - above all - the silly, silly play. It has a plot so stupid that you stretch your eyes in disbelief wondering whether you and it can both be awake in the West End at the same time. Sutherland is an awkward stage animal, with his muzzy consonants and his ill-tuned, foggily projected voice. He does nothing original or interesting with the role apart from varnishing it with an aura of craggy authority. </p> <p><strong> Independent on Sunday:</strong> Enigmatic Variations is built round twists. I wouldn't want to give anything away - least of all tickets. </p> <p><strong> Independent:</strong> Like Sleuth with intellectual pretensions. It is a mystery why a director as talented as Anthony Page has associated himself with such clunking material, weighed down by the hamfisted translation by the star's son, Roeg Sutherland.

Terry Hands's staging suggests what the barnstorming American companies of the 19th century must have been like: potboiler productions emphasising melodrama over psychology, with a lot of stately actors planting themselves like trees at the edge of the stage and declaiming fiercely and nobly. Kelsey Grammer basically has two gears here - amoral, confident Macbeth and tender, contrite Macbeth - and he has pretty much worn them out by the end of his second monologue. </p> <p><strong> Financial Times: </strong> Judged on scene-by-scene comprehensibility, this must be one of the murkiest readings of Macbeth I have witnessed.</p>",

Orangemen, who have held a year-long vigil at Drumcree parish church in protest at last year's ban, have underlined their determination to march this year by filing for two parades on consecutive Sundays. The Drumcree parade - the biggest flashpoint in Northern Ireland's annual loyalist marching season - normally takes place on the last Sunday before the main July 12 Orange commemorations. In the violent loyalist backlash which followed the decision to ban the march in 1998 three young children from one family were killed in a petrol bomb attack on their home. An army spokesman yesterday described the temporary arrival of the troops as \"prudent contingency plans\". Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, insisted that the government was still committed to continuing to \"scale down\" the security presence in Northern Ireland following the IRA decision to open three arms dumps to international inspectors last week. Tension at Drumcree this year is expected to be greater than last year, when the military were not called in. Many unionists feel betrayed by the resumption of the Northern Ireland assembly without the IRA being being forced to hand over arms. Hardline unionists yesterday stepped up the pressure on David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, when they secured the support of 30 members of the Northern Ireland assembly to force a debate to exclude Sinn Fein from the power-sharing executive. But the motion, tabled by Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, will not succeed because votes in Northern Ireland have to attract cross-community support to be passed. However, the DUP hopes to expose divisions within Mr Trimble's party by attracting the support of disgruntled Ulster Unionists. Two UUP members who opposed Mr Trimble's decision to re-establish the executive, Peter Weir and Pauline Armitage, broke ranks yesterday to support the DUP motion, prompting the DUP deputy leader, Peter Robinson, to challenge others to support him. Two DUP ministers are expected to resign if, as is almost certain, their proposal is rejected. Other members of their party will then fill their seats. The renewed threat to Mr Trimble came as the government unveiled an important concession to nationalists in the police bill, which will set up the force to replace the RUC. At a hearing of the committee stage of the bill at Westminster, Adam Ingram, the Northern Ireland security minister, said the government would accept a key demand of the SDLP over the oath sworn by members of the new force. The amendment will mean police recruits will swear to respect all \"traditions and beliefs\", seen by nationalists as recognition of their identity.",

A lot of rubbish was sold at inflated prices last year and stabilisation means this is put to an end.\" </p> <p>Britain's housing boom triggered better than forecast annual results for Berkeley Group. Pre-tax profits for the year to April 30 rose from \u00a3110.2m in 1999 to \u00a3143.2m - an increase of 30%. Analysts had expected \u00a3138m. </p> <p>Turnover was up \u00a3102m to \u00a3799m and the number of units sold went from 2,825 to 2,915, with the average price per property up \u00a320,000 to \u00a3251,000. A final dividend of 9.8p is expected. Combined with February's interim dividend of 3.1p, the total payment to shareholders will be 12.9, up 15.2% year on year. </p> <p>Mr Lewis attributed the profit growth to rising house values, particularly in the south-east which accounts for around 70% of the company's income. The group has advance bookings for the coming year of \u00a3400m and expects the profits from its 1,665-unit development in Chelsea Harbour to come in during 2001-02. </p> <p>UBS Warburg adjusted profit forecasts for 2000-01 yesterday to \u00a3157.5m following the results announcement. </p> <p>Shares closed up 13p yesterday at 623.5p</p>",

      "bodyText": "Property group Berkeley is in the middle of a good run. And the more pessimistic view of the property price boom is not going to upset that. Berkeley Group denies that yesterday's report from the Royal Chartered Institute of Surveyors, which reported a slowdown in house prices, will have a negative effect on the year ahead. Chairman Roger Lewis said: \"The market needs a period of stabilisation and we do better during such times. A lot of rubbish was sold at inflated prices last year and stabilisation means this is put to an end.\" Britain's housing boom triggered better than forecast annual results for Berkeley Group. Pre-tax profits for the year to April 30 rose from \u00a3110.2m in 1999 to \u00a3143.2m - an increase of 30%. Analysts had expected \u00a3138m. Turnover was up \u00a3102m to \u00a3799m and the number of units sold went from 2,825 to 2,915, with the average price per property up \u00a320,000 to \u00a3251,000. A final dividend of 9.8p is expected. Combined with February's interim dividend of 3.1p, the total payment to shareholders will be 12.9, up 15.2% year on year. Mr Lewis attributed the profit growth to rising house values, particularly in the south-east which accounts for around 70% of the company's income. The group has advance bookings for the coming year of \u00a3400m and expects the profits from its 1,665-unit development in Chelsea Harbour to come in during 2001-02. UBS Warburg adjusted profit forecasts for 2000-01 yesterday to \u00a3157.5m following the results announcement. Shares closed up 13p yesterday at 623.5p",

Under the new plans to develop the business, which has been hurt by the advent of the lottery, pools coupons might soon be extended outside the UK and Australian football to major championships such as the World Cup and league matches in Europe. The Liverpool-based business is to be reversed into the much smaller Rodime, essentially a \u00a340m shell company in which Bank of Scotland has a 49% stake. Mr Hemmings, who has stakes in the Blackpool Tower, 800 pubs and racecourses through Arena Leisure, masterminded the deal and was the successful bidder against 12 others. He has promised to keep the 750 jobs in the pools operation. The sale leaves Littlewoods, founded by Sir John Moores in the 1920s, with a retail business which yesterday admitted it was having a \"tough time\" in its home shopping areas. With its customer base in the \"middle market\", Littlewoods' retailing plight is similar to that of C&amp;A, which is pulling the plug on its 109 stores, and rival catalogue firm GUS. The businesses are being squeezed by discount retailers. However, Barry Gibson, chief executive of Littlewoods, said yesterday that he had put in a bid for up to 30 of the C&amp;A stores. Littlewoods, still owned by more than 30 members of the Moores family, tried to demonstrate that its performance on the high street had not been as bad as its home shopping area, where its catalogues had featured over-priced clothes. Two and a half years into a transformation programme initiated by a restructuring of the Moores' family management control, chairman James Ross tried to play down speculation that the next move for the streamlined retail operation would also be a stock market flotation. The Moores family is expected to take a 15% interest in Rodime once the transaction is completed. As a result of the deal and hefty rights issue, Rodime, which started life as the inventor of the 3.5 inch PC disk drive, is expected to be owned about 25% by Mr Hemmings and his family, 25% by Bank of Scotland, 15% by the Moores family with other stakes being held by the 8,000 or so private shareholders in the group. Mr Hemmings is rumoured to have been interested in bidding for the pools business alone, with the backing of Bank of Scotland, but looked for another strategy after concluding that the door should be left open for other investors. Eric Kilby, a director of Hemway Limited, Mr Hemmings' company, said that the group would aim to capitalise on the pools' image not being about gambling. He said the pools still had 1m players a week, linked to the \"national game\" - football - and would look to expand into other areas, such as the premier and European leagues. \"Its heritage is in football.\" The sale also includes Bet247.co.uk, Littlewood's answer to the online betting and gaming industry, as well as Bet Direct, a telephone betting service. The profits figures produced by Littlewoods yesterday showed that sales had fallen by 11% to \u00a3211m while profits were just \u00a320m. While Mr Hemmings will not take a seat on the board of Rodime, he would play a \"role in helping to select the right people to take it forward\", Mr Kilby said. Under the terms of the deal, the Littlewoods name can be used for 10 years. The Moores family is yet to decide whether to take the \u00a3161m as a cash windfall or reinvest it in the retail business. Mr Ross, who was brought in four years ago to turn around the operation, said he would like to able to use the money to reduce debt and invest in new businesses, such as online retailing, financial services through Woolwich and Shop! its shopping channel.",

He then became an apprentice bricklayer in his native Lancashire and within five years had his own business. That was sold to Christian Salvesen for \u00a31.5m in the 1970s. A second building company was sold to Barratts for \u00a35.7m a few years later. </p> <p>By this year, a career built on shrewd deal-making had gained him 54th place in the Sunday Times rich list which estimated his worth at \u00a3450m. He clearly had a good year, climbing from 64th in 1999. </p> <p>At the age of 64, Mr Hemmings remains a virtual recluse as far as the press is concerned. His deals are largely done through private companies which does not expose the entrepreneur to the gaze of either the City at large or the business pages. </p> <p>He does not appear, however, to have lost any of his appetite for deal-making, despite the advancing years. Nor has he lost his grit after taking Vymura for \u00a329m in a hostile bid. His other recent deals included the acquisition of Blackpool Tower and a number of piers from First Leisure for \u00a373m and a string of buys which took his pub estate to some 900. </p> <p>Mr Hemmings made his name in the holiday camp business. In 1987 he led the \u00a357m management buyout of the Pontins group from Bass and later sold it to Scottish &amp; Newcastle for a sizeable profit after turn ing the fortunes of the business round. He became a director at S&amp;N and engineered the acquisition of the more upmarket Center Parcs holiday destinations. </p> <p>The key to his success, he has claimed, is mingling with the people. \"You will not see me in the restaurants at Lingfield [racecourse] or Ayr,\" he once said. \"I queue up at the chippy with the real people. You have to learn about the real people and understand their requirements.\" </p> <p>Mr Hemmings owns around half of Arena Leisure the quoted racecourse owner which, among others, owns Lingfield Park. At Arena, however, the internet has played its part in Mr Hemming's recent gains in wealth. Hopes of online betting profits from Arena Leisure have caused shares in the company to soar.</p>",

His deals are largely done through private companies which does not expose the entrepreneur to the gaze of either the City at large or the business pages. He does not appear, however, to have lost any of his appetite for deal-making, despite the advancing years. Nor has he lost his grit after taking Vymura for \u00a329m in a hostile bid. His other recent deals included the acquisition of Blackpool Tower and a number of piers from First Leisure for \u00a373m and a string of buys which took his pub estate to some 900. Mr Hemmings made his name in the holiday camp business. In 1987 he led the \u00a357m management buyout of the Pontins group from Bass and later sold it to Scottish &amp; Newcastle for a sizeable profit after turn ing the fortunes of the business round. He became a director at S&amp;N and engineered the acquisition of the more upmarket Center Parcs holiday destinations. The key to his success, he has claimed, is mingling with the people. \"You will not see me in the restaurants at Lingfield [racecourse] or Ayr,\" he once said. \"I queue up at the chippy with the real people. You have to learn about the real people and understand their requirements.\" Mr Hemmings owns around half of Arena Leisure the quoted racecourse owner which, among others, owns Lingfield Park. At Arena, however, the internet has played its part in Mr Hemming's recent gains in wealth. Hopes of online betting profits from Arena Leisure have caused shares in the company to soar.",

      "body": "<p>In February 1999, the political party known as the Union D\u00e9mocratique Fran\u00e7aise, usually described as \"centriste\", decided in Bordeaux that, in the forthcoming European elections, they would stand as an independent party. Most people thought the finest speech made on this occasion came from Pierre Pflimlin, who has died aged 93, eloquent and incisive as ever, in spite of his years.</p> <p>He stood then, as he always had, for three great causes: Europe, Alsace and Social Catholicism. But for many listening, the most prominent episode in his long career was his appointment as prime minister in May 1958, which precipitated the demise of the fourth republic, and which, without Pflimlin's skill and honesty, could have led to civil war in France.</p> <p>At that time, internal divisions and the repercussions of the Algerian war had made government in France impossible. When President Coty invited Pflimlin to form a government on May 8, the country had been without a premier for 38 days.</p> <p>In Algeria, the reaction to his appointment was violent. Pflimlin had earlier, in the Strasbourg newspaper, Le Nouvel Alsacien, suggested a ceasefire and negotiations among all parties. The army rejected this. Crowds demonstrated on both sides of the Mediterranean, declaiming that Algeria was French. Pflimlin's summer house, in the south of France, was bombed. On May 13, as he was asking the national assembly for a vote of confidence, insurgents seized power in Algiers.</p> <p>The immediate result was a clear vote of confidence in Pflimlin, since most deputies felt that there had to be a government in power to face up to the crisis. But the situation worsened; Corsica was invaded, and it seemed that the mainland would be attacked, with parachutists landing in Paris.</p> <p>General de Gaulle was the unknown factor.

      "bodyText": "In February 1999, the political party known as the Union D\u00e9mocratique Fran\u00e7aise, usually described as \"centriste\", decided in Bordeaux that, in the forthcoming European elections, they would stand as an independent party. Most people thought the finest speech made on this occasion came from Pierre Pflimlin, who has died aged 93, eloquent and incisive as ever, in spite of his years. He stood then, as he always had, for three great causes: Europe, Alsace and Social Catholicism. But for many listening, the most prominent episode in his long career was his appointment as prime minister in May 1958, which precipitated the demise of the fourth republic, and which, without Pflimlin's skill and honesty, could have led to civil war in France. At that time, internal divisions and the repercussions of the Algerian war had made government in France impossible. When President Coty invited Pflimlin to form a government on May 8, the country had been without a premier for 38 days. In Algeria, the reaction to his appointment was violent. Pflimlin had earlier, in the Strasbourg newspaper, Le Nouvel Alsacien, suggested a ceasefire and negotiations among all parties. The army rejected this. Crowds demonstrated on both sides of the Mediterranean, declaiming that Algeria was French. Pflimlin's summer house, in the south of France, was bombed. On May 13, as he was asking the national assembly for a vote of confidence, insurgents seized power in Algiers. The immediate result was a clear vote of confidence in Pflimlin, since most deputies felt that there had to be a government in power to face up to the crisis. But the situation worsened; Corsica was invaded, and it seemed that the mainland would be attacked, with parachutists landing in Paris. General de Gaulle was the unknown factor. Was he in favour of the insurrection or waiting for the right moment to install himself at the head of a military dictatorship? Pflimlin met de Gaulle secretly during the night of May 26 and asked him to condemn the insurgents, but the general refused.

      "body": "<p>The American composer Alan Hovhaness, who has died aged 89, achieved and refined a striking synthesis between eastern and western musical cultures. Mainstream 20th-century music was of almost no concern to him; nearly every piece was spiritually rooted in ancient, and often remote, mysticism. The result was that his music was not taken seriously by the fashionable avant-garde, but nonetheless had many devotees.</p> <p>The sheer scale of his output - well over 400 numbered works, including 67 symphonies - reflects a huge range of oriental, middle and near-eastern material. The titles of his works - such as Men Are Brothers (Symphony no 11), Compassion (Symphony no 26), Love Songs Of Hafiz, City Of Light (Symphony no 22) - point to a man with an inwardly peaceful spirit, drawing strength from his fellow creatures and their creator, and glorifying them in music.</p> <p>The natural world of mighty rivers, lofty mountains, distant temples, mist-shrouded forests and myriad stars is evoked by his endless tapestries of tintinnabulation, woven with figures, canons and chorales.</p> <p>Hovhaness was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, to a Scottish mother and Armenian father. He took an early interest in the piano and, before commencing lessons at the age of nine with Adelaide Proctor, learned to improvise and compose using a homemade musical notation method. Soon after entering Tufts University in 1929, he won a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music , studying with Frederick Converse, a significant composer and musical figure of his day .</p> <p>Captivated by his Armenian heritage, he began voraciously exploring Armenian liturgical music, as well as that of the composer Komitas Vartabed (1869-1936), who was virtually unknown outside Armenia. Hovhaness's Symphony No 1, Exile (1936) had some Siberian overtones, but it is a strikingly original testimony to the plight of the Armenian nation during the Turkish persecution of the first world war. It was given a BBC performance under Leslie Heward in 1939.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hovhaness's interest in other eastern cultures was expanding and , in 1940, he decided to destroy a whole host of earlier works with which he was dissatisfied. H e began to adapt an increasingly improvisatory, seamless Byzantine musical language, overlaid with neo- baroque fugal structures. At about this time, he also introduced a technique he called \"spirit murmur\", whereby instruments, mainly strings, would improvise freely within defined limits, often using modal or whole-tone scales and glissandi, as in his piano concerto Lousadzak (The Coming Of Light, 1944).</p> <p>By now, Hovhaness was living in Boston, supporting himself by teaching music, and playing the organ at the Armenian church. In 1942, he went on a scholarship to the Tanglewood music centre, but came away disappointed; Lukas Foss and Aaron Copland had criticised his music. From then on, he became his own man musically.</p> <p>A chance attendance at a concert in Boston, given by a visiting group of Indian musicians, gave further impetus to his eastern interests and, by 1950, after a two-year spell on the staff at Boston Conservatory, Hovhaness left to become a fulltime composer. The following year, he moved to New York after the award of his first Guggenheim fellowship.</p> <p>H e conducted the New York Philharmonic in the first performance of his St Vartan symphony, written in memory of the 5th-century Armenian martyr and consisting of a long series of short, embellished tableaux.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, he found a supporter in Leopold Stokowski, who was also based in New York , where he had established his own orchestra. I n 1955, Stokowski was appointed conductor of the Houston Symphony, and asked Hovhaness for a new piece for his opening concert.</p> <p>The result, Mysterious Mountain, has become enduringly popular: Hovhaness always imagined it as what the earliest American music may have sounded like. \"Mountains,\" he said, \"represent symbols, like pyramids, of man's attempt to know God. They are symbolic meeting places between the mundane and spiritual worlds. \" Many other \"mountain\" pieces followed.</p> <p>In 1959, Hovhaness went to India on a Fulbright fellowship, where he directed the premiere of his Arjuna Symphony (No 8) , which features jhalas and other unusual Indian ostinati. He was accorded celebrity status the next year in Japan, where he immersed himself in gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and noh drama, which led to several operas. It was thus inevitable that when he visited Korea, he should be drawn to ah-ak (old Korean court music) and, in 1963, his Symphony No 16 was scored for both western and Korean instruments (a further symphony for this combination followed in 1978). In 1962, he spent a year as composer-in-residence in Hawaii.</p> <p>Travel fascinated Hovhan- ess, and many pieces cast their eye towards journeys both ancient and modern, such as Symphony No 15 (Silver Pilgrimage, 1963), another Stokowski commission, replete with lavish parts for gongs, bells and brass, Odysseus Symphony (1973) and Journey to Vega (1982).</p> <p>In the late 1960s, Hovhaness settled in Lucerne, Switzerland, from where he visited London for concerts and to undertake recordings of his orchestral music for issue on his personal record label. One of his really big tunes can be found in the orchestral portrait Fra Angelico (1968), written in homage to the artist who painted in an oriental style.</p> <p>His own music began to evolve towards a fusion of the many influences he had absorbed, but he lost no enthusiasm for experimentation: the large tone poem, And God Created Great Whales (1970), combines orchestra with the sound of hump-backed whales on tape. By the mid-1970s, he had moved permanently to Seattle, and his prolific work rate stood up until he was well into his 70s: more than 40 symphonies appeared between 1972 and 1992, though there was latterly a drift towards predictabilty.</p> <p>He was a gracious and hospitable host at his idyllic home in the Cascade mountains. A tall, charismatic man, with kindly eyes and sage-like beard, he exuded an aura of timelessness. When asked for his view as to the path modern music was taking, he replied: \"To me, atonality is against nature. In nature, everything has a centre: the planets, the sun, the moon and the earth.\" As to the place of his own music: \"Well, it will all be sorted out in a few hundred years.\"</p> <p>Hovhaness married Elizabeth Whittington in 1959. After their divorce he married, in 1977, the singer Hinako Fujihara, for whom many of his later pieces were written. His huge legacy seems set for a fair wind in the new age of eclecticism and romanticism. <br></p> <p>\u0095Alan Hovhaness (Chakmakjian) , composer, born March 8 1911; died June 21 2000</p>",

Mainstream 20th-century music was of almost no concern to him; nearly every piece was spiritually rooted in ancient, and often remote, mysticism. The result was that his music was not taken seriously by the fashionable avant-garde, but nonetheless had many devotees. The sheer scale of his output - well over 400 numbered works, including 67 symphonies - reflects a huge range of oriental, middle and near-eastern material. The titles of his works - such as Men Are Brothers (Symphony no 11), Compassion (Symphony no 26), Love Songs Of Hafiz, City Of Light (Symphony no 22) - point to a man with an inwardly peaceful spirit, drawing strength from his fellow creatures and their creator, and glorifying them in music. The natural world of mighty rivers, lofty mountains, distant temples, mist-shrouded forests and myriad stars is evoked by his endless tapestries of tintinnabulation, woven with figures, canons and chorales. Hovhaness was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, to a Scottish mother and Armenian father. He took an early interest in the piano and, before commencing lessons at the age of nine with Adelaide Proctor, learned to improvise and compose using a homemade musical notation method. Soon after entering Tufts University in 1929, he won a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music , studying with Frederick Converse, a significant composer and musical figure of his day . Captivated by his Armenian heritage, he began voraciously exploring Armenian liturgical music, as well as that of the composer Komitas Vartabed (1869-1936), who was virtually unknown outside Armenia. Hovhaness's Symphony No 1, Exile (1936) had some Siberian overtones, but it is a strikingly original testimony to the plight of the Armenian nation during the Turkish persecution of the first world war. It was given a BBC performance under Leslie Heward in 1939. Meanwhile, Hovhaness's interest in other eastern cultures was expanding and , in 1940, he decided to destroy a whole host of earlier works with which he was dissatisfied. H e began to adapt an increasingly improvisatory, seamless Byzantine musical language, overlaid with neo- baroque fugal structures. At about this time, he also introduced a technique he called \"spirit murmur\", whereby instruments, mainly strings, would improvise freely within defined limits, often using modal or whole-tone scales and glissandi, as in his piano concerto Lousadzak (The Coming Of Light, 1944). By now, Hovhaness was living in Boston, supporting himself by teaching music, and playing the organ at the Armenian church. In 1942, he went on a scholarship to the Tanglewood music centre, but came away disappointed; Lukas Foss and Aaron Copland had criticised his music. From then on, he became his own man musically. A chance attendance at a concert in Boston, given by a visiting group of Indian musicians, gave further impetus to his eastern interests and, by 1950, after a two-year spell on the staff at Boston Conservatory, Hovhaness left to become a fulltime composer. The following year, he moved to New York after the award of his first Guggenheim fellowship. H e conducted the New York Philharmonic in the first performance of his St Vartan symphony, written in memory of the 5th-century Armenian martyr and consisting of a long series of short, embellished tableaux. Shortly afterwards, he found a supporter in Leopold Stokowski, who was also based in New York , where he had established his own orchestra. I n 1955, Stokowski was appointed conductor of the Houston Symphony, and asked Hovhaness for a new piece for his opening concert. The result, Mysterious Mountain, has become enduringly popular: Hovhaness always imagined it as what the earliest American music may have sounded like. \"Mountains,\" he said, \"represent symbols, like pyramids, of man's attempt to know God. They are symbolic meeting places between the mundane and spiritual worlds. \" Many other \"mountain\" pieces followed. In 1959, Hovhaness went to India on a Fulbright fellowship, where he directed the premiere of his Arjuna Symphony (No 8) , which features jhalas and other unusual Indian ostinati. He was accorded celebrity status the next year in Japan, where he immersed himself in gagaku (ancient Japanese court music) and noh drama, which led to several operas. It was thus inevitable that when he visited Korea, he should be drawn to ah-ak (old Korean court music) and, in 1963, his Symphony No 16 was scored for both western and Korean instruments (a further symphony for this combination followed in 1978). In 1962, he spent a year as composer-in-residence in Hawaii. Travel fascinated Hovhan- ess, and many pieces cast their eye towards journeys both ancient and modern, such as Symphony No 15 (Silver Pilgrimage, 1963), another Stokowski commission, replete with lavish parts for gongs, bells and brass, Odysseus Symphony (1973) and Journey to Vega (1982). In the late 1960s, Hovhaness settled in Lucerne, Switzerland, from where he visited London for concerts and to undertake recordings of his orchestral music for issue on his personal record label. One of his really big tunes can be found in the orchestral portrait Fra Angelico (1968), written in homage to the artist who painted in an oriental style. His own music began to evolve towards a fusion of the many influences he had absorbed, but he lost no enthusiasm for experimentation: the large tone poem, And God Created Great Whales (1970), combines orchestra with the sound of hump-backed whales on tape. By the mid-1970s, he had moved permanently to Seattle, and his prolific work rate stood up until he was well into his 70s: more than 40 symphonies appeared between 1972 and 1992, though there was latterly a drift towards predictabilty. He was a gracious and hospitable host at his idyllic home in the Cascade mountains. A tall, charismatic man, with kindly eyes and sage-like beard, he exuded an aura of timelessness. When asked for his view as to the path modern music was taking, he replied: \"To me, atonality is against nature. In nature, everything has a centre: the planets, the sun, the moon and the earth.\" As to the place of his own music: \"Well, it will all be sorted out in a few hundred years.\" Hovhaness married Elizabeth Whittington in 1959. After their divorce he married, in 1977, the singer Hinako Fujihara, for whom many of his later pieces were written. His huge legacy seems set for a fair wind in the new age of eclecticism and romanticism. \u0095Alan Hovhaness (Chakmakjian) , composer, born March 8 1911; died June 21 2000",

The Foreign Office said the trip by Mr Lee, who is regarded by Beijing as still exerting separatist influence, was a \"private visit by a private citizen\". John Gittings, Hong Kong Dealers vow to act on diamonds Antwerp diamond dealers pledged yesterday to strengthen controls in concert with war-torn countries like Sierra Leone and Angola. Peter Meuss, director-general of the Belgian city's Diamond High Council, said members would cooperate with a strict certification system and expel anyone found flouting it. Britain is leading a drive to help curb African wars sparked by rebel groups in control of diamond areas.

      "bodyText": "Nearly one child in 80 born in Britain today is a test-tube baby, according to figures compiled by Europe's fertility specialists. Just 22 years after British doctors astonished the world with the birth of Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby, more than 200,000 treatment cycles a year are being carried out in Europe. France leads with 45,000, followed by Britain with 34,000 and Germany on more than 28,000. The three leaders account for half of all fertility provision in Europe. The statistics from 18 countries, compiled for the first time by fertility specialists around Europe, were revealed yesterday at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Bologna, Italy. They show that 1.3% of all births in Europe are the result of either the standard test-tube baby technique IVF (in vitro fertilisation) or ICSI - where a single sperm is injected into the egg. In Britain, the proportion is 1.2%. Britain has the second highest number of IVF and ICSI children, at 8,727 in the year 1997-98, just below France at 8,762. Unlike France, however, where the state will pay for four attempts at IVF, the NHS will fund only one or two attempts for most couples and in some areas long waiting lists mean private treatment is virtually the only option. Francoise Shenfield of the reproductive medicine unit of University College London, said: \"The inequality of access in the UK is outrageous.\" Karl Nygren, from the Sofia hospital in Stockholm, presenting the statistics, said Britain and France were doing well in terms of their success in achieving live births. In Britain 27.5% of fertilised eggs returned to the womb resulted in a live birth, while France achieved 25.6%. Those countries with higher figures - such as Spain on 45.5% and the Czech Republic on 38.9% - achieved them only by returning a large number of embryos to the womb each time, which results in high rates of multiple births - twins, triplets, quads and even more. Most fertility specialists agree that multiple births, which risk complications such as cerebral palsy as well as stress, are undesirable. \"That is a very strong message, that they are having a good success rate but running the risk of the dire consequences that are not talked about enough,\" Professor Nygren said. \"The couples who are in grief and depression with children who are mentally handicapped do not want to talk about it. How can you say you regret having a child?\" Scandinavia has the lowest incidence of multiple births from fertility treatment, because of a consensus among clinics that no more than two embryos should be replaced in the womb. There is growing pressure, he said, to return one. The European average for births per treatment cycle is around 20%, which compares with 26% in the United States, where there are high rates of multiple births. Private clinics put back large numbers of embryos to maximise women's chances of becoming pregnant, both to optimise their own success rates and because the couple can often not afford to return for further treatment for future babies.",

      "bodyText": "The use of lasers to drill a hole in a fertilised egg - a technique banned in the US - is safe and successful in helping older women with fertility problems to have babies, according to new research. Yesterday two Hungarian doctors reported that babies born to 96 women in the St John hospital in Budapest using the technique showed no higher rate of birth defects than usual. Increasingly women over the age of 35, when fertility goes into decline, are seeking IVF (test tube baby treatment) because they have left it late to have a family. But although they produce eggs and those eggs can be fertilised outside the womb, often the egg will not implant in the wall of the uterus. The shell of the egg, called the zona pellucida, gets thicker and harder with age and will not burst under pressure from multiplying cells inside, as it should. Katalin Kanyo and Janos Konc are using lasers to help the egg while it is still in the petri dish. \"We look through the microscope and measure the zona pellucida,\" said Dr Kanyo, \"and then, with a surgical laser, we give two tiny bursts of energy.\" The result is not so much a hole as a tunnel at the very edge of the shell with a diameter between 4.5 and 20 millionths of a metre. The egg, primed to hatch, is then placed in the uterus. The Hungarian team focused on the safety of the technique, looking at 134 babies, now aged between six and 18 months, born to 96 women and found the malformation rate was just 2%. In the study group were 32 patients over 35 and 11 over the age of 40. Dr Kanyo said the women had a 22% chance of taking home a baby - compared with just 4% or 5% normally.",

      "body": "<p>Outwardly, the minister is bullish. Hilary Armstrong, after all, has quietly driven through potentially far-reaching changes in the government of England and Wales over the past three years by dragging - as she would put it - some tired old councils kicking and screaming into the 21st century. </p> <p>Yet she still finds it hard to hide her frustration at the slow pace of change and the growing resistance of Labour councillors and backbenchers to reforms which are sweeping aside old committees in favour of town hall \"cabinets\". Many councillors feel they have now been pushed to the sidelines, relegated to scrutiny committees meant to monitor the executive, while an elite, usually about 10, makes key decisions behind closed doors. </p> <p>Looking over her shoulder, Armstrong must know that some key Labour councillors, fed up with what they regard as Whitehall's centralising tendency riding roughshod over local democracy, are close to revolt. What's more, the Local Government Association (LGA), which begins its annual conference in Bournemouth today, has all but accused ministers of treating councils with contempt and, implicitly, undermining local democracy. </p> <p>On the surface, at least, councils are being given more freedoms. Indeed, next year should herald a bright new dawn. Town hall modernisers in the Blairite New Local Government Network, which has strong links with the minister, are planning a \"democracy day\" in May with referendums in big cities (maybe Birmingham and Newcastle) and boroughs (like Watford and Lewisham) to further test the concept of elected executive mayors. Armstrong is pushing the idea, while others have raised the prospect of a government advertising blitz pushing for a \"yes\" vote. </p> <p>\"Despite the debacle in London, there is clear evidence that people out there are interested... and at least want to have a say about it,\" she says. \"And, of course, a mayor in a borough will have very different powers, much stronger, than the mayor of London.\" </p> <p>That's because big councils, unlike the new, slimline Greater London Authority, have unitary status, providing a full range of services, from education to social services, refuse collection, housing, planning and even economic development. Blessed with all these powers, a provincial mayor should be a far bigger-hitter than Ken Livingstone, who will frequently have to defer to 33 London councils. </p> <p>But below the surface, the modernising agenda is murkier. It's one thing to lay the framework for cabinet-style government and elected mayors; quite another to give go-ahead councils the freedom they need, the ability to be more self-sustaining and, crucially, to raise more of their own cash (currently Whitehall provides three-quarters of town hall funding, council tax meets the rest). </p> <p>While the government is prepared to give with one hand, councils fear ministers are preparing to take away with the other - gradually transferring key elements of local government, such as education, social services and housing provision, to central control, new partnerships with health authorities or, in the case of housing, arms-length companies and housing associations with powers to borrow on the open market. </p> <p>\"Frontline-first\" is the much-vaunted agenda of David Blunkett, education secretary, and Alan Milburn, health secretary, to hop over councils and health authorities and direct money straight to schools and hospitals. With education and social services by far the biggest spending departments in local government, the agenda is sending shock waves through towns halls. Power, influence and - the LGA would say - local democracy is at stake. That's why delegates at Bournemouth this week will hear that the Labour-led association is preparing to fight as never before. </p> <p>But if that wasn't bad enough, the government's attitude towards local government generally is far from clear.

      "bodyText": "Outwardly, the minister is bullish. Hilary Armstrong, after all, has quietly driven through potentially far-reaching changes in the government of England and Wales over the past three years by dragging - as she would put it - some tired old councils kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Yet she still finds it hard to hide her frustration at the slow pace of change and the growing resistance of Labour councillors and backbenchers to reforms which are sweeping aside old committees in favour of town hall \"cabinets\". Many councillors feel they have now been pushed to the sidelines, relegated to scrutiny committees meant to monitor the executive, while an elite, usually about 10, makes key decisions behind closed doors. Looking over her shoulder, Armstrong must know that some key Labour councillors, fed up with what they regard as Whitehall's centralising tendency riding roughshod over local democracy, are close to revolt. What's more, the Local Government Association (LGA), which begins its annual conference in Bournemouth today, has all but accused ministers of treating councils with contempt and, implicitly, undermining local democracy. On the surface, at least, councils are being given more freedoms. Indeed, next year should herald a bright new dawn. Town hall modernisers in the Blairite New Local Government Network, which has strong links with the minister, are planning a \"democracy day\" in May with referendums in big cities (maybe Birmingham and Newcastle) and boroughs (like Watford and Lewisham) to further test the concept of elected executive mayors. Armstrong is pushing the idea, while others have raised the prospect of a government advertising blitz pushing for a \"yes\" vote. \"Despite the debacle in London, there is clear evidence that people out there are interested... and at least want to have a say about it,\" she says. \"And, of course, a mayor in a borough will have very different powers, much stronger, than the mayor of London.\" That's because big councils, unlike the new, slimline Greater London Authority, have unitary status, providing a full range of services, from education to social services, refuse collection, housing, planning and even economic development. Blessed with all these powers, a provincial mayor should be a far bigger-hitter than Ken Livingstone, who will frequently have to defer to 33 London councils. But below the surface, the modernising agenda is murkier. It's one thing to lay the framework for cabinet-style government and elected mayors; quite another to give go-ahead councils the freedom they need, the ability to be more self-sustaining and, crucially, to raise more of their own cash (currently Whitehall provides three-quarters of town hall funding, council tax meets the rest). While the government is prepared to give with one hand, councils fear ministers are preparing to take away with the other - gradually transferring key elements of local government, such as education, social services and housing provision, to central control, new partnerships with health authorities or, in the case of housing, arms-length companies and housing associations with powers to borrow on the open market. \"Frontline-first\" is the much-vaunted agenda of David Blunkett, education secretary, and Alan Milburn, health secretary, to hop over councils and health authorities and direct money straight to schools and hospitals. With education and social services by far the biggest spending departments in local government, the agenda is sending shock waves through towns halls. Power, influence and - the LGA would say - local democracy is at stake. That's why delegates at Bournemouth this week will hear that the Labour-led association is preparing to fight as never before. But if that wasn't bad enough, the government's attitude towards local government generally is far from clear. Will town halls, for instance, in future merely become a focus for local partnerships - covering areas from housing to urban regeneration, education and welfare - with less emphasis on direct control if Labour is re-elected for a second term? With all sorts of initiatives being pushed down from Whitehall, from the New Deal for communities to a national strategy for neighbourhood renewal, just where do councils fit in? Different ministers give differing theories. Armstrong says that new legislation giving councils powers to promote social and economic well-being holds the key for ambitious town halls. \"We see them as the key partner,\" she insists. \"We are saying that where they become that key partner, where they demonstrate that level of leadership, then they will get the ability to really get new flexibilities and freedoms, too. If you look at some councils, they are the driving force for regeneration, for economic development, and they have the trust and the support of the business community, the voluntary sector and so on...\" But here's the threat. \"If they're not,\" says the minister, \"we're going to have to make sure that other people are taking the lead.\" She seems to be offering a carrot and wielding a stick. Extolling the virtues of \"strategic partnerships\", embracing business and other stakeholders across authorities, she insists again: \"We're saying they should really be the key to identifying priorities, but that then those priorities need to have their own neighbourhood focus... that has to involve local people in a very strong way.\" She adds: \"The authority really ought to be the organisation leading that, but if they're not up to it, we would want to make sure that somebody [else] actually did it.\" That takes us right back to the mayoral debate. A local government finance white paper, due shortly, will propose giving councils greater powers to borrow money for big capital projects without getting prior approval from Whitehall.

Councils might eventually be allowed to get 5% of that rate, with some who are granted \"beacon\" status getting 10%, but that's all. \"I don't want to over-egg the pudding,\" Armstrong cautions. \"We're not going down the American route of not much national tax and more local tax. But there are some freedoms we're looking at. We always had a much greater principle in this country, one I want to uphold, of redistribution.
