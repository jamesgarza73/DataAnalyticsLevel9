But he is little more than a criminal psychopath, intent on personal power at all costs and enjoying the support of President Gaddafi of Libya and Charles Taylor of Liberia. So long as he is part of the government, or probably even in Sierra Leone, there will not be peace.</p> <p>The politics of Sierra Leone are bitterly sad and infernally complicated. Today the basic problem is this: a civilian government was properly elected in 1996 after years of military and rebel mayhem and despite rebel atrocities. In the countryside in early 1996 I met refugees whose limbs had been cut off by the rebels as punishment for voting in the election.</p> <p>The ordinary people who fared best - who did not lose their limbs - were in those areas of the country where a South African group of mercenaries called Executive Outcomes (EO) were in control.</p> <p>EO had been brought in by the military regime which was attempting at last to make the transition to democracy. They drove the rebels away from Freetown, the capital, and then out of the areas around the diamond fields, which have been both the curse of Sierra Leone and the principal source of its potential wealth. The mercenaries were expensive but the people who lived under EO protection did not have to fear mutilation or death at rebel hands, as did almost everyone else in the country. The mercenaries were very popular.</p> <p>Despite the rebels' attempts to ruin the elections, they went rather well and Ahmed Tejan Kabbah was elected president. He saw that Executive Outcomes was vital to the government and said he would retain them. He began peace talks with Foday Sankoh, who insisted he would not make peace so long as EO remained.</p> <p>Rebel atrocities continued. Eventually, under pressure from both West Africa and the rest of the world to make peace, Kabbah had to ask EO to leave. Sierra Leone began to fall apart again. In 1997 Kabbah was overthrown in a coup backed by Sankoh, and went into exile in Guinea. There he engaged the services of another British mercenary group, Sandline, to try and secure his return. Some members of the British Foreign Office appear to have encouraged this, and I believe they were right given the circumstances. But there was an almighty hypocritical stink in London when it was revealed.</p> <p>In 1998 Kabbah was restored to office by a Nigerian-led force assisted by Sandline. Sankoh had been arrested by the Nigerians and in October 1998 was sentenced to death, but not executed. His rebel movement, the RUF, continued to commit atrocities and by the end of 1998 they invaded Freetown. As Kosovo imploded Sierra Leone dissolved again into bloodshed worse than anything in the Balkans. The rebels abducted about 4,000 children to serve in their army.</p> <p>We went to war for the Kosovan Albanians but there was never any question of doing so for Sierra Leone. The reasons are both sad and obvious and do not require repetition, but they give the lie to the claim that there now exists a \"progressive\" or \"humanitarian\" foreign policy agenda, in London or anywhere else.</p> <p>Nigeria, now a democracy, wanted to leave, and unable to find other military assistance for President Kabbah, the international community insisted that he release Sankoh from jail and bring him into government. Sankoh demanded he be given control of the diamond fields. A blanket amnesty was extended. Under international duress Kabbah signed the peace agreement, accompanied by a little girl with an amputated arm.</p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, visited Sierra Leone in summer 1999 and was appalled by what he saw. The rebels' conduct, he said, \"make all our fine speeches about peace and humanity seem inadequate, even futile\". He said that \"no one can feel happy about a peace agreement obtained on such terms\" - but what was the alternative? Sierra Leone would never get the international support that Kosovo now enjoyed.</p> <p>This deal with the devil never worked. Sankoh and his friends reaped the spoils of office while their soldiers continued to kill and mutilate in the bush. When the first UN peacekeepers arrived last year Sankoh denounced them and said they were living on \"blood money\". The present crisis has been gathering ever since.</p> <p>In the middle of last week when Annan heard of the RUF attack on the peacekeepers, he was nearing the end of an African tour. He immediately tried to get Sankoh's supporters abroad to compel him to release the peacekeepers. Sankoh would not. Annan called for the peacekeepers to be reinforced.</p> <p>Britain has now responded to this challenge, but it is not clear what the paratroopers and marines now being sent to Freetown will do. Are they merely to extricate British nationals? Or are they to support the peacekeepers with appropriate force? Only the latter can really help Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Remember that the war in Bosnia was only ended in 1995 after the British and French sent a heavily-armed rapid reaction force to support the lightly-armed peacekeepers in order to suppress Serbian guns. That is what is needed in Sierra Leone; if the security council will not agree it, there is little hope for peace.</p> <p>The RUF must be shown that it cannot continue forever to enjoy the impunity that it has been given for far too long. And Sankoh himself can no longer be any part of the process. In 1999, rather than being executed, he was given another chance. He did not deserve that chance then and he certainly does not deserve any more accommodations now. He is nothing less than a lunatic murderer.</p> <p>He must be removed not only from government but also from Sierra Leone. Sending him next door into Liberia would be pointless; his bloodstained patron Charles Taylor would allow him to continue the war from there. If he cannot be brought before a properly constituted court to be tried for his crimes, he must be sent into distant exile where perhaps finally his hold over his child soldiers and their thuggish \"officers\" will diminish. Libya seems one possibility. So long as he remains in Sierra Leone, peace is impossible. If the international community, led by Britain, will not remove him, and defeat his forces, the outlook for Sierra Leone is appalling.</p> <p>The rebels can be defeated. They are not vast in numbers, they have no ideology and without Sankoh they would have no real leadership. But the gruesome story of the past four years shows that President Kabbah cannot defeat them without outside assistance.</p> <p>It is perhaps not surprising that traditional peacekeeping troop contributor countries - from both the first and the third world - are more and more reluctant to expose their soldiers to the dangers that peacekeeping involves.</p> <p>This surely means that we should start considering the unthinkable. The recent history of Sierra Leone shows that mercenaries or private security forces, properly supervised and controlled, may be the best answer to this and some other crises.</p> <p>Private security firms could not do all jobs. They could not undertake the immensely difficult peacekeeping mission proposed for the Congo and now threatened by events in Sierra Leone. Nor the expansion of peacekeeping forces n Lebanon. But in some places where governments fear to have their soldiers tread, they could play an important role. Mercenaries do not have to be \"dogs of war\". Executive Outcomes' troops were loved where they were deployed In Sierra Leone. If Kabbah had not been compelled to get rid of them in 1997, Sankoh's RUF might have been contained and the horrors of the last two years avoided. Hundreds of children would still have their arms.</p> <p>William Shawcross's book Deliver Us From Evil - Warlords, Peacekeepers and a World of Endless Conflict, is published by Bloomsbury</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br><a href=\"http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/unamsil/body_unamsil.htm\" target=\"_new\">UNMASIL - UN mission</a><br><a href=\" http://www.sierra-leone.org/\" target=\"_new\">Sierra Leone Web</a></p>",

When the first UN peacekeepers arrived last year Sankoh denounced them and said they were living on \"blood money\". The present crisis has been gathering ever since. In the middle of last week when Annan heard of the RUF attack on the peacekeepers, he was nearing the end of an African tour. He immediately tried to get Sankoh's supporters abroad to compel him to release the peacekeepers. Sankoh would not. Annan called for the peacekeepers to be reinforced. Britain has now responded to this challenge, but it is not clear what the paratroopers and marines now being sent to Freetown will do. Are they merely to extricate British nationals? Or are they to support the peacekeepers with appropriate force? Only the latter can really help Sierra Leone. Remember that the war in Bosnia was only ended in 1995 after the British and French sent a heavily-armed rapid reaction force to support the lightly-armed peacekeepers in order to suppress Serbian guns. That is what is needed in Sierra Leone; if the security council will not agree it, there is little hope for peace. The RUF must be shown that it cannot continue forever to enjoy the impunity that it has been given for far too long. And Sankoh himself can no longer be any part of the process. In 1999, rather than being executed, he was given another chance. He did not deserve that chance then and he certainly does not deserve any more accommodations now. He is nothing less than a lunatic murderer. He must be removed not only from government but also from Sierra Leone. Sending him next door into Liberia would be pointless; his bloodstained patron Charles Taylor would allow him to continue the war from there. If he cannot be brought before a properly constituted court to be tried for his crimes, he must be sent into distant exile where perhaps finally his hold over his child soldiers and their thuggish \"officers\" will diminish. Libya seems one possibility. So long as he remains in Sierra Leone, peace is impossible. If the international community, led by Britain, will not remove him, and defeat his forces, the outlook for Sierra Leone is appalling. The rebels can be defeated. They are not vast in numbers, they have no ideology and without Sankoh they would have no real leadership. But the gruesome story of the past four years shows that President Kabbah cannot defeat them without outside assistance. It is perhaps not surprising that traditional peacekeeping troop contributor countries - from both the first and the third world - are more and more reluctant to expose their soldiers to the dangers that peacekeeping involves. This surely means that we should start considering the unthinkable. The recent history of Sierra Leone shows that mercenaries or private security forces, properly supervised and controlled, may be the best answer to this and some other crises. Private security firms could not do all jobs. They could not undertake the immensely difficult peacekeeping mission proposed for the Congo and now threatened by events in Sierra Leone. Nor the expansion of peacekeeping forces n Lebanon. But in some places where governments fear to have their soldiers tread, they could play an important role. Mercenaries do not have to be \"dogs of war\". Executive Outcomes' troops were loved where they were deployed In Sierra Leone. If Kabbah had not been compelled to get rid of them in 1997, Sankoh's RUF might have been contained and the horrors of the last two years avoided. Hundreds of children would still have their arms.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party last night seemed ready to agree a compromise deal with Ken Livingstone, the newly elected mayor of London, on terms for accepting jobs in his administration after earlier refusing to participate unless Mr Livingstone \"stepped back\" from confrontation with the government over the tube. After days of haggling, the party's Greater London assembly members are now expected to accept Mr Livingstone's offer to appoint Nicky Gavron as his deputy for a year and nominate Lord Harris as chair of the Metropolitan police committee in exchange for an independent investigation of tube funding. The journalist and rail expert Simon Jenkins, who is a critic of the government's part-privatisation plans for the London Underground, was last night in talks with the mayor about becoming chairman of an independent panel of experts to examine both the government's scheme and Mr Livingstone's bond financing plan. Labour's decision will be taken at a meeting of its Greater London assembly members today, but last night Mr Livingstone - who joined David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, at a government skills and training launch - said he was \"absolutely confident\" that Ms Gavron would accept the offer to become deputy mayor of London. The party's Millbank headquarters claimed that Mr Livingstone had \"conceded\" its demands - including for Labour appointees to have the right to pursue their own policy agenda and dissociate themselves from any mayoral political grandstanding - and had \"shifted his position on the tube\". That was denied by Mr Livingstone's spokesman, who insisted: \"Ken hasn't changed his position, but he thinks it's right for the mayor to have an independent panel to look at all the options, particularly in the light of the fact that the government's own assessment is biased in favour of the private sector.\" Labour was also pointing to the fact that Frank Dobson, its unsuccessful mayoral candidate, had committed himself to appointing an independent panel to consider new schemes for tube modernisation - rather than the government's existing plans - and that Mr Livingstone had yesterday agreed to use Mr Dobson's principles for assessing the alternatives. The prospect of a power-sharing agreement came after 24 hours of intense argument within the nine-strong GLA Labour group, London party and Labour hierarchy about whether and how far to cooperate with Mr Livingstone, who yesterday chatted aimiably with the Queen at the opening of London's new millennium bridge over the Thames at Southwark. On Monday night, the London Labour board split down the middle about whether Ms Gavron and Lord Harris should accept the independent mayor's offers and left it to yesterday's group meeting to decide. While Ms Gavron has been keen to take up the post of deputy mayor, Mr Dobson's former running mate Trevor Phillips, who is less likely to get the coveted job of assembly chairman if Labour accepts Mr Livingstone's proposals, is understood to have urged caution. \"We are not going to find ourselves essentially being part of an administration which spends all its time attacking the policies on which we were elected,\" Mr Phillips said yesterday. \"The issue here is not about personalities, it is about policies.\" Mr Livingstone's manifesto committed him to \"fight to retain a unified underground system in the public sector\" and \"argue that we should finance the investment needed to modernise the tube by the cheapest possible method, which the evidence indicates is raising bonds backed by a combination of fares and government grant\". But a Labour spokesman insisted yesterday that the party's 1997 election mandate overrode Mr Livingstone's and added that in any case Londoners had voted for him for a variety of reasons, rather than simply his stand on the tube. The government is currently committed to locking in its part-privatisation scheme before handing over responsibility for London Transport to Mr Livingstone.",

He lives in relation to the prime minister as Baldrick does to Blackadder - he doesn't merely need his support, but without Mr Blair he would not exist.</p> <p>Even he, however, could not praise the prime minister for personally saving Rover. Instead, he paid tribute to the third way, which is the political equivalent of scientology - also a meaningless jumble of gobbledygook - and a crafty means of allotting the credit to our great leader, L Ron Blair.</p> <p>\"The corporate state has been tried and it simply did not work. But neither did a naive reliance on laissez-faire, which led to a crippling obsession with what government should not do,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We cannot rely on heads. Equally, we cannot sit back and hope for tails.</p> <p>\"We will never order chips. On the other hand, we know it is right to reject mash. We cannot approve of Ronnie, but at the same time we say 'no' to Reggie.

Mr Hague must be feeling a bit like the management of BMW: he made a big investment in Mrs Browning, he rescued her from the backbenches, saving her and all her suppliers - researchers, secretaries etc - from destitution, only to see the credibility of his core business draining away. But I don't think a consortium will rescue Mrs Browning from the fate that awaits her. The bankers won't allow it.</p> <p>Mr Byers was able to claim that Rover workers would judge the Tories by their party political response. They looked almost embarrassed at this until the minister blew it: \"While those of us who were getting our sleeves rolled up ...\" he said, and they collapsed in laughter.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Byers has had an awful last few weeks, much of it his own fault. But you would need to be a miserable curmudgeon not to feel a twinge of pleasure on his behalf when he rose yesterday to say that Rover, or at least some of it, had been saved. Perhaps. For the time being. Mr Byers is the ultimate Blairite. He lives in relation to the prime minister as Baldrick does to Blackadder - he doesn't merely need his support, but without Mr Blair he would not exist. Even he, however, could not praise the prime minister for personally saving Rover. Instead, he paid tribute to the third way, which is the political equivalent of scientology - also a meaningless jumble of gobbledygook - and a crafty means of allotting the credit to our great leader, L Ron Blair. \"The corporate state has been tried and it simply did not work. But neither did a naive reliance on laissez-faire, which led to a crippling obsession with what government should not do,\" he said. \"We cannot rely on heads. Equally, we cannot sit back and hope for tails. \"We will never order chips. On the other hand, we know it is right to reject mash. We cannot approve of Ronnie, but at the same time we say 'no' to Reggie. Instead, we shall opt for the third Kray...\" Well, of course he didn't say the last bits, but when ministers launch in on these self-admiring platitudes, you expect similar drivel to issue forth at any moment. Angela Browning, the Tory industry spokeswoman, made a graceless little speech in which she did not even express pleasure at the planned rescue. Mr Hague must be feeling a bit like the management of BMW: he made a big investment in Mrs Browning, he rescued her from the backbenches, saving her and all her suppliers - researchers, secretaries etc - from destitution, only to see the credibility of his core business draining away. But I don't think a consortium will rescue Mrs Browning from the fate that awaits her. The bankers won't allow it. Mr Byers was able to claim that Rover workers would judge the Tories by their party political response. They looked almost embarrassed at this until the minister blew it: \"While those of us who were getting our sleeves rolled up ...\" he said, and they collapsed in laughter. Phoney laughter, to be sure, but it cheered them up after Mrs B. She was not the only Tory woman who suffered for the cause yesterday. For some time this column has had a kindly eye open for Anne McIntosh, MP for the Vale of York, not least because she carpet-bombs our office in the Commons with faxed press releases about every little event which happens in her life. It hasn't yet got to the stage of \"Anne McIntosh takes cue from Nick Soames; flosses teeth regularly,\" but that can't be far off. \"Stop Press!\" reads a recent despatch from the front, \"MP welcomes further inquiry into pylon line.\" Later, \"MP stands up for the countryside. Venue and time change for photo op!\" In March, she thrillingly visited a chocolate factory: \"MP samples sweet success.\" Days earlier, she cheerfully announced that constituents were welcome to meet her while she ate a hamburger. \"Little Mac to meet Big Mac for Millennium Mac.\" But there is something engagingly naive about Miss McIntosh.

      "body": "<p>It was a painful day for London, with the FTSE 100 losing 92.5 points to 6123.8. </p> <p>A few of the leaders, some with \"old economy\" status but with heavy consumer exposure, were in demand, such as drinks group <strong> Diageo </strong> (up 40p at 583.5p) and retailer<strong> Kingfisher</strong> (25p firmer at 542p). Even <strong> Bass</strong> put in a strong rally, ending the session 36p higher at 782p. </p> <p>But heavy fails among the technology heavyweights ruined the atmosphere. The fall in Vodafone, down almost 6% on the day, accounted for 43 points off the Footsie. </p> <p>There was also some heavy selling of <strong> BP Amoco</strong> - blamed on old fashioned profit-taking. The shares closed down 19.5p at 577.5p after a strong set of first quarter figures. </p> <p>The slump in technology stocks gathered pace in the afternoon as thin trading and profit-taking took the shine off decent results from the TMT sector. </p> <p>In the US, the Nasdaq's downward spiral continued ahead of the Fed's decision on interest rates, due next week, adding to the general gloom. </p> <p>Dealers said institutions seemed to be paralysed, waiting for news on borrowing costs and unwilling to take short term market positions, leading to extremely thick trading conditions. </p> <p>At the close, the Techmark 100 had fallen 99.04 points to 3,634.87. </p> <p>Early features lost their lustre as the day wore on, as solid interim figures comfortably ahead of expectations for <strong> Baltimore</strong> and <strong> Sage </strong> failed to save either from the general rout. </p> <p>By the close, Baltimore was down 333p to \u00a366.36, reversing an earlier 381p gain in exceptionally thin volumes. Sage, whose first-half results were also well above consensus estimates, held in positive territory, but ended the day just 4p higher at 671p after a 73p jump in the morning. </p> <p>Elsewhere only a few of the larger TMT stocks managed to make headway. <strong> Fibernet</strong>, recovering after heavy falls last week, closed up 25p to 302.5p, while <strong> Easynet</strong>, coming back from a precipitate drop over the last few months, managed a further rally of 45p to 887.5p. </p> <p>Long-term support from analysts for many telecoms stocks could not stem short-term weakness, with <strong> Telewest</strong> losing 28.5p to 342.5p, <strong> Kingston Communications</strong> dropping 47p to 700p and <strong> Colt Telecom</strong> easing 149p to \u00a326.40. <strong>BT</strong> was also a faller, down 43p to 957p at the close, as was <strong> Redstone Telecom</strong>, slipping 40p to 410p. </p> <p><strong> Motion Media</strong>, despite announcing a surveillance deal with CCTV specialists Norbain, lost 18p to 113p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a painful day for London, with the FTSE 100 losing 92.5 points to 6123.8. A few of the leaders, some with \"old economy\" status but with heavy consumer exposure, were in demand, such as drinks group Diageo (up 40p at 583.5p) and retailer Kingfisher (25p firmer at 542p). Even Bass put in a strong rally, ending the session 36p higher at 782p. But heavy fails among the technology heavyweights ruined the atmosphere. The fall in Vodafone, down almost 6% on the day, accounted for 43 points off the Footsie. There was also some heavy selling of BP Amoco - blamed on old fashioned profit-taking. The shares closed down 19.5p at 577.5p after a strong set of first quarter figures. The slump in technology stocks gathered pace in the afternoon as thin trading and profit-taking took the shine off decent results from the TMT sector. In the US, the Nasdaq's downward spiral continued ahead of the Fed's decision on interest rates, due next week, adding to the general gloom. Dealers said institutions seemed to be paralysed, waiting for news on borrowing costs and unwilling to take short term market positions, leading to extremely thick trading conditions. At the close, the Techmark 100 had fallen 99.04 points to 3,634.87. Early features lost their lustre as the day wore on, as solid interim figures comfortably ahead of expectations for Baltimore and Sage failed to save either from the general rout. By the close, Baltimore was down 333p to \u00a366.36, reversing an earlier 381p gain in exceptionally thin volumes. Sage, whose first-half results were also well above consensus estimates, held in positive territory, but ended the day just 4p higher at 671p after a 73p jump in the morning. Elsewhere only a few of the larger TMT stocks managed to make headway. Fibernet, recovering after heavy falls last week, closed up 25p to 302.5p, while Easynet, coming back from a precipitate drop over the last few months, managed a further rally of 45p to 887.5p. Long-term support from analysts for many telecoms stocks could not stem short-term weakness, with Telewest losing 28.5p to 342.5p, Kingston Communications dropping 47p to 700p and Colt Telecom easing 149p to \u00a326.40. BT was also a faller, down 43p to 957p at the close, as was Redstone Telecom, slipping 40p to 410p. Motion Media, despite announcing a surveillance deal with CCTV specialists Norbain, lost 18p to 113p.",

There was anger among the workers, many of whom believed a gun was being held to their head by management who said they would not sign any contract without the agreement with workers in place. It is understood the yard is close to clinching a \u00a3400m contract to build four ferries for a Norwegian line that was dependent on the workers agreeing to the pay and conditions package. The shipyard management welcomed the vote and said it would \"aggressively pursue new orders.\" A spokesman refused to say whether the Norwegian order was imminent. At a 90-minute meeting, held behind closed doors in central Belfast, the shipyard workers narrowly voted 424 to 389 to accept the deal, which will guarantee skilled workers a minimum of \u00a3310 a week. It is expected the workforce will be cut from 1,300 to 1,000. Bobby Carson, president of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said workers had been angry but if the yard signed the ferry order it would provide three years work and a platform for continued shipbuilding.

His father was a guerrilla fighter in the Baltic region. \"It was hard, but we survived,\" said Pavel Todorchuk, 81, a veteran of the campaigns for Kiev, Warsaw, and Berlin in 1945 \"We didn't respect Yeltsin, but we respect Putin,\" he said. \"We'll see how he does, what his team is like, and then we'll make up our minds about him.\" In what has become the pattern of the five-month Putin presidency - a triumph of form over content - the new leader concentrated on the feelgood factor, waxing nostalgic for the Soviet Union while avoiding even the slightest of policy statements. He addressed the troops as \"comrades\", spoke of the \"great Soviet motherland\" before young veterans of the current Chechen war, in the khaki capes and helmets of the 1940s, marched past his podium to stirring martial music. Despite defeat in Afghanistan, the 1994-96 Chechen war and the cold war, Russia, Mr Putin asserted, was making a habit of the victory secured in 1945. A Putin supporter, Nikita Mikhalkov, the film director, used the anniversary to call for Volgograd, the city where decisive battle was joined, to revert to its Soviet name, Stalingrad.",

Mr Giscard, more downbeat, expressed concern about the continuing decline of the single currency. \"We wanted the euro to be independent,\" he said, \"but we didn't want it to be an orphan.\" On a gloriously sunny day in Brussels, commission staff took Europe Day off while the Foreign Office in London held an open day featuring celebrities including Frank Bruno, Blackadder actor Tony Robinson,and quiz show host William G Stewart. Keith Vaz, minister for Europe, praised the cultural diversity of the continent, illustrated by the Euro-punch which he quaffed with Frank Bruno. Its ingredients, from each of the member countries, included Red Bull (Austria), blackberries (Finland), water melons (Ireland), and strawberries (UK). Francis Maude, shadow foreign secretary, agreed there was \"much to celebrate\" on the Schuman anniversary. But he said stability for the next century \"can still be threatened if European nations make the wrong choices\".",

The Home Office is to reveal the decision, which will be followed by a consultation document in the summer with legislation in the next parliamentary session. The move was foreshadowed yesterday, on the eve of the public inquiry into the Paddington rail crash, by David Calvert-Smith, director of public prosecutions. He called for a new offence of \"corporate killing\", saying the law was \"insufficient to deal with what is culpable conduct\". The news came on the day that the crown prosecution service revealed there was \"insufficient evidence\" to provide a realistic prospect of conviction of an individual or company over the Paddington rail crash last October, in which 31 people died and hundreds were injured. That decision dismayed relatives who accused the CPS of acting too hastily. But the health and safety executive made clear last night it was still carrying out inquiries, and it was still open for it to pursue criminal charges against a company. Mr Calvert-Smith told the Commons home affairs select committee yesterday: \"I am entirely in favour of an offence, properly drafted, of corporate killing, which will enable the criminal courts to bear down on negligent treatment of employees in the workforce.\" Present laws for dealing with such cases had \"reached the buffers\". This was demonstrated during the Southall rail crash trial when the crown prosecution service failed to persuade the courts that the common law offence of manslaughter could be applied to corporations, in this case Great Western Trains. Mr Calvert-Smith added: \"At the moment, the law is, in our view, insufficient to deal with what is culpable conduct.

It said it would conclude its investigations by July and would publish them. A decision to prosecute would not affect the Paddington rail crash inquiry, which is still likely to be sitting by then. The two drivers involved in the crash are dead, and the inquiry chaired by Lord Cullen will be taking evidence from several corporate bodies and companies at the heart of the Paddington crash, among them Railtrack, Thames Trains, First Great Western, and the railway inspectorate. The role of the inspectorate has been called into question by Jenny Bacon, the HSE's director general, in the first published evidence submitted to Cullen. In it, she effectively blamed the HSE for not pressing the railway inspectorate hard enough on reported problems on signal 109, which was at the centre of the crash. She said more could have been done by the HSE to enforce health and safety legislation on the railway, and that consideration of signals passed at danger was based on \"incomplete data\".

Two months after Mr McCain dropped out of a bitter Republican primary contest, he finally agreed to meet Mr Bush in Pittsburgh and, after an 80-minute encounter behind closed doors, offered to campaign \"enthusiastically\" for the Texas governor against Vice-President Al Gore, the Democratic contender. However, the senator from Arizona betrayed little outward enthusiasm at a joint press conference at which body language was scrutinised in forensic detail for signs of healing of the Republican wounds left by the primaries. Mr McCain had the delicate task of reassuring Republicans that he can be a team player while maintaining his identity as a reformer on campaign finance and an independent thinker on taxation, with the aim of leaving open the possibility of a presidential run in 2004 if Mr Bush fails this year. The Vietnam war hero had been withholding a full endorsement, demanding that Mr Bush embrace greater regulation of corporate funding of political candidates and to reduce his proposed $460bn tax cut to leave more funds to bolster the social security system. The Bush camp, however, pointed out that Mr McCain had won the support of only a tenth of the delegates to the Republican convention, and was not in a powerful bargaining position. Reconciliation clearly did not come easily to the senator, who did not mouth the key word \"endorse\" until prompted by the press.

We may believe we are being subtle, but when we dislike someone it seems we cannot help but show it, the study reveals.</p> <p>The evidence of our inability to mask our true feelings was unearthed by Jon Hess, of the University of Missouri-Columbia, when he analysed how we manage to maintain relationships with people we really do not like.</p> <p>After questioning nearly 350 students on how they dealt with tricky, but unavoidable, family or work relationships, he found they used a variety of different ways to distance themselves.</p> <p>At their most extreme, these involved putting people down or failing to acknowledge their presence, and, at their most subtle, avoiding eye contact or jokes and banter.</p> <p>Professor Hess, assistant professor of communication at the university, said that, on average, each person disliked three others at any one time - but used between five and 10 ways of hiding this by distancing themselves.</p> <p>The most common means of doing so were: being reserved by avoiding all intimate topics of conversation; not asking questions, so as to speed up any interaction; treating the other person as a stranger; physically avoiding them; not paying attention to them; and showing excessive politeness.</p> <p>At work, people avoided face-to-face contact, and if possible used the telephone or sent memos and emails.</p> <p>Prof Hess said it was perfectly possible for the person who was disliked to be unaware of provoking such antipathy.</p> <p>People tried to maintain a facade of civility if they were forced into regular contact with those they disliked, but the stress of this led to distancing strategies.</p> <p><b>Telltale signs of hostility</b></p> <p>\u0095They avoid asking questions - to speed up communication</p> <p>\u0095They lie - to avoid intimacy</p> <p>\u0095They humour you, merely tolerating your behaviour</p> <p>\u0095They give you the cold shoulder</p> <p>\u0095Conversations are polite - but meaningless</p> <p>\u0095Conversations are excessively polite - as though you are a stranger</p> <p>\u0095They exclude you from conversations</p> <p>\u0095They avoid joking with you</p> <p>\u0095They speed up business - to get away quickly</p> <p>\u0095They fail to pay you much attention</p> <p>\u0095They avoid eye contact</p> <p>\u0095They leave the room when you arrive</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is a feeling estate agents, lawyers, traffic wardens, and even in-laws experience with regularity: the suspicion that people dislike them - but they cannot quite pinpoint why. Until now, that is. New research has revealed 36 telltale signs which reveal whether someone really hates you. We may believe we are being subtle, but when we dislike someone it seems we cannot help but show it, the study reveals. The evidence of our inability to mask our true feelings was unearthed by Jon Hess, of the University of Missouri-Columbia, when he analysed how we manage to maintain relationships with people we really do not like. After questioning nearly 350 students on how they dealt with tricky, but unavoidable, family or work relationships, he found they used a variety of different ways to distance themselves. At their most extreme, these involved putting people down or failing to acknowledge their presence, and, at their most subtle, avoiding eye contact or jokes and banter. Professor Hess, assistant professor of communication at the university, said that, on average, each person disliked three others at any one time - but used between five and 10 ways of hiding this by distancing themselves. The most common means of doing so were: being reserved by avoiding all intimate topics of conversation; not asking questions, so as to speed up any interaction; treating the other person as a stranger; physically avoiding them; not paying attention to them; and showing excessive politeness. At work, people avoided face-to-face contact, and if possible used the telephone or sent memos and emails. Prof Hess said it was perfectly possible for the person who was disliked to be unaware of provoking such antipathy. People tried to maintain a facade of civility if they were forced into regular contact with those they disliked, but the stress of this led to distancing strategies. Telltale signs of hostility \u0095They avoid asking questions - to speed up communication \u0095They lie - to avoid intimacy \u0095They humour you, merely tolerating your behaviour \u0095They give you the cold shoulder \u0095Conversations are polite - but meaningless \u0095Conversations are excessively polite - as though you are a stranger \u0095They exclude you from conversations \u0095They avoid joking with you \u0095They speed up business - to get away quickly \u0095They fail to pay you much attention \u0095They avoid eye contact \u0095They leave the room when you arrive",

Diego Pineiro-Zillar died in hospital from multiple wounds after he and his half-brother, 15, were attacked in Earlham Street, Covent Garden, on Sunday evening. A knife was found at the scene and a man aged 52 is being questioned by police in connection with the attack. Yesterday Epegmenzio Rodriguez, headteacher of Canada Blanch, the independent Spanish school Diego attended on the Portobello Road in west London, said the school had tightened security after graffiti, written in white correcting fluid and declaring love for Diego, appeared at the school's entrance. Speaking in the chapel of the Spanish-government-funded 400-pupil school, Mr Rodriguez said: \"At the end of October we detected that Diego was having problems outside of school because someone was harassing him. As soon as we were aware of this we called the police and we contacted the family. \"Both the police and the family told us a person was being investigated because something had been going on. \"They told us there were adults or officials to make sure there was always a companion with Diego both to the school and from the school. \"A few weeks later we saw some graffiti at the school's entrance. \"We reported it to the police again because we knew this man had written this graffiti, and the police took some photos and gave us permission to delete it because they had the proof already. \"When this happened the police told us they had arrested a man and they had adopted some measures to prevent this man from coming near the school or near where Diego lived.\" The last contact the school had with the police was at the end of December when more graffiti were found at the entrance. But after that \"nothing strange\" had occurred near school premises. Mr Rodriguez could not say when police measures were stopped. But he said that he was \"disappointed and sad\" that the police had not informed him that the man was no longer under surveillance. Diego's murder had devastated the school. Classmates and friends yesterday gathered in the playground to sign a large Spanish flag with tributes to Diego. One of the largest read: \"From your pals at school. We will all miss you.

      "bodyText": "For weeks after Susan Blatchford and her schoolfriend Gary Hanlon disappeared, a chocolate Easter egg decorated with tiny pink and yellow roses stood on the sideboard in her home awaiting her return. The youngsters had gone missing just two days after Easter in 1970 and Susan's mother Muriel insisted that her daughter would walk in at any moment. But as the weeks turned into months and no sign of the pair was found, the families' hopes began to fade of seeing the children alive again. Even when their bodies were discovered on June 17, after a nationwide search involving hundreds of officers, led by Detective Chief Inspector Leonard \"Nipper\" Read, the celebrated officer who had brought the Kray twins to justice, the waiting was still not over. The badly decomposed bodies could offer no evidence as to how they had died and the coroner, Dr Charles Clark, was forced to record an open verdict. Now, just over 30 years later, the families have finally learned the details of their children's final hours and the identity of the man responsible for their deaths. Ronald Jebson had kept his terrible secret for almost three decades. As a paedophile with a string of offences living in the area where the children disappeared, he had been one of the 15,000 people questioned by police but he was able to give a full account of his movements on March 31. That account, he finally confessed from his prison cell in 1998, had been a pack of lies. On the last day of her short life, Susan - a well-built girl with long brown hair who appeared much older than her 11 years - had been teaching her niece and nephew how to fly a kite in a nearby park. At 4.30pm, she returned to her home in Riley Road in Enfield, north London, before calling at Gary's house in Marrilyne Avenue where he asked his mother if he could join her for a walk. Susan, an outgoing tomboy, often played with her fellow pupil at Albany comprehensive school, in Enfield Highway. Gary, 12, was told to be back for his dinner in an hour's time and the pair were last seen walking down the road laughing hand in hand as Gary clutched his football under his arm. Their parents contacted police at 8pm that night but were told simply to wait at home. The police mounted a full scale search of Epping Forest, with more than 600 officers, including the special patrol group, frogmen, helicopters and sniffer dogs. The bodies were eventually discovered 11 weeks later by Leonard Cook, then 20, whose labrador dog, Tessa, found the bodies huddled together in a den close to the pathway running across a small, densely wooded copse on the outskirts of Epping Forest - just a 30 minute walk from the youngsters' homes. DCI Read broke the news to the families in person and within days the press tagged the deaths the \"Babes in the Wood\" case. A heatwave had hastened decomposition of the bodies which had to be identified by their clothing. Gary's clothes - a brown cardigan, jumper and blue jeans - appeared to be undisturbed, except for his black plimsolls, which were found nearby. But while Susan was still wearing her green raincoat with red stitched pockets, a floral patterned blouse and green corduroy trousers, her bra, knickers, stockings, socks and shoes had all been removed. The discovery of the bodies was embarrassing for the police who had twice searched the copse with sniffer dogs but failed to find the bodies hidden in the deep undergrowth. Jebson, born in August 1938 to an unmarried mother, had been adopted by John and Muriel Jebson when he was only a few months old. Always a loner, he joined the army in 1958 but was discharged on medical grounds. In 1960 he enlisted again, but within months went absent without leave. He claimed to have been rejected by his adoptive parents, and for many years reverted to his birth name of Harper. Although he also claimed to have married and had a daughter now aged in her teens, no marriage or birth certificates have ever been found. An alcoholic who abused amphetamines and other drugs, Jebson spent much of his adult life in an out of prison for a string of crimes, including three sex offences against children, and once told a prison psychologist that he was \"afraid of himself\" and that he had done \"evil\" over the years. In December 1968, he was jailed for two years for indecently assaulting a six-year-old girl while she slept in her bedroom. After his release on March 2, 1970 he went to live with Robert Papper, an old school friend, and his young family in Hatfield. Just 29 days after Jebson's release from prison in 1970, Gary and Susan disappeared. Weeks later, in April, Jebson enticed a young boy from Retford, in Nottinghamshire, into his car, took him into the woods and sexually assaulted him, a crime for which he was jailed for five years in May that year. When Jebson was released from prison in August 1973, he again returned to stay at the Pappers' home but, after being asked to leave the following year, he raped their eight-year-old daughter Rosemary, and strangled her with baling twine.",

Bright students from less affluent areas often do not apply for or take up places at the top universities, even when their A-level grades and academic records warrant it, research shows. Mr Blunkett will announce a drive to encourage poorer pupils to apply for places among the top layer of academic institutions. Teachers and parents also need to be engaged to help persuade students to apply, he believes. Under the plan, backed by the institutions, university tutors will build up \"twinning\" relationships with teachers in inner city schools. Mr Blunkett is expected to offer more money for bursaries for 16- and 17-year olds from poor backgrounds to attend summer schools at leading universities. According to the Higher Education Funding Council, only 3,500 students from low income families get into Oxford, Cambridge, York, Bristol, Warwick, Nottingham, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Durham and, in London, Imperial and University Colleges and the London School of Economics. But by entry qualifications and subject mix, 4,600 should. The Sutton Trust, a charity campaigning to reduce social inequality in education, says that someone from a private school is nearly 30 times more likely to get into a top 13 university than from a disadvantaged background. The trust's summer school scheme is likely to be rewarded in the initiative, to be announced by Mr Blunkett at the Association of University Teachers' council meeting in Eastbourne. \"The access challenge is one that government and universities must face together,\" Mr Blunkett is expected to say. \"The key issue is that we need to address access in radically new ways if we are to improve take-up for those students who are able to benefit across all universities in line with their A-level achievements. \"The future of children should not be determined by where they live or where they went to school or college.\" Tony Blair and Mr Blunkett announced last year that 5,000 16- and 17-year-olds from inner city areas would be offered the chance of a taste of university or college at 70 higher education institutions. Bright students are being nominated by student co-ordinators appointed by local authorities in the \u00a34m scheme. Ministers deny that tuition fees and student loans discourage poorer students from applying to university. But they believe there is a gap in expectation.

His confession brings to an end a 30-year police investigation involving more than 600 officers who interviewed 14,272 people and searched 4,356 houses and 5,000 acres of woodland. Jebson, who is already serving a life sentence for raping and strangling to death an eight-year-old girl in 1974, claimed he did not want to die with the two murders on his conscience. But Detective Chief Inspector Declan Donnelly, who headed the recently reopened murder investigation, described Jebson as a \"highly dangerous, fixated, sadistic paedophile\" who would kill again if released. He said that Jebson may also have been involved in other unsolved crimes. The widowed mothers of both children, Beryl Hanlon, 66, and Muriel Blatchford, 79, wept as they heard about their children's last hours, during which they were plied with alcohol, raped and sexually assualted before being strangled. Despite a nationwide police search for the children, their decomposed bodies were not discovered for 11 weeks in a small copse on the fringes of Epping Forest. The causes of death could not be established and the coroner recorded an open verdict. The case was not reopened until 1996 when Jebson first admitted involvement. He eventually made a full confession in August 1998, leading to the exhumation of Susan's body for a second postmortem examination. Sentencing Jebson, Judge David Stokes told him: \"Thirty years ago you abducted, sexually assaulted and brutally murdered two young children. \"What they went through before they died does not bear thinking about. The only point on your behalf is that you finally owned up to what you did which caused a small degree of comfort to their close relatives who are here to see justice done. \"You are a truly wicked and perverted man.\" Now white-haired with a pony-tail and beard, Jebson showed no emotion as he was led back to the cells, flanked by three guards. The families of the two children described Jebson as a \"monster\" and pleaded with the home secretary, Jack Straw, to leave him to die in prison so no more children would be at risk from him. Jebson, who has 11 previous convictions including three for sexual offences against youngsters, admitted to prison psychologists that he was \"evil\" and was especially dangerous to children, saying: \"If I get a few drinks and poppers, nothing would stop me.\"",

Needless to say, it doesn't take long for Walken to outwit these amateurs, and all hell breaks loose.

Needless to say, it doesn't take long for Walken to outwit these amateurs, and all hell breaks loose. The film doesn't start out promisingly at all but through a series of twists and turns it takes on a character of its own. The Last Supper (Stacy Title, 1995) 10.30pm, FilmFour Sharp little indie comedy about a group of PC housemates who start knocking off objectionable dinner guests and burying them in the garden. Cameron Diaz and Annabeth Gish are among the five who, having debated whether they would have assassinated Hitler in 1919, start the cull, beginning with redneck Bill Paxton, in a memorable cameo. Nora Dunn is the cop who grows suspicious of all the digging out back. Exterminating Angel (Luis Bu\u00f1uel, 1962) 12.10am, FilmFour More mealtime mayhem. The bourgeoisie gather for a dinner party and are having a lovely time, until they realise that some strange force is preventing them going home. That force is, of course, the surrealist Bu\u00f1uel, who having rudely interrupted the party, presides over the collapse of civilisation, as all etiquette flies out the dining room window. Brilliantly black comedy. The Wings Of The Dove (Iain Softley, 1997) 2.10am, Sky Premier Softley and scriptwriter Hossein Amini create a modern romantic drama out of the Henry James novel. Set in Edwardian London and Venice, it has Helena Bonham Carter remaking her Merchant-Ivory image: as well-to-do Kate, she is involved in an affair with lowly Merton (Linus Roache), and is prepared to act disgracefully to keep both him and her position in society. Alison Elliott plays her unfortunate friend; Elizabeth McGovern, Charlotte Rampling and Michael Gambon are high-class support.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the Three Tenors all attend a concert, but only as part of the audience, then you know that something special is going on. And indeed, ever since the word got out that the revered tenor Carlo Bergonzi planned to sing his first and only performance of Verdi's Otello in New York at the age of 75 this month, seats for the Carnegie Hall event have been opera's hottest ticket of the year. </p> <p>It seemed incredible that a singer who quit the operatic stage more than a decade ago and who is at an age where even the most carefully preserved voice is a shadow of its former glory could still have the drive and the resources to undertake one of the most demanding roles in the operatic repertoire for the first time. Yet Bergonzi never did anything lightly. Throughout a career that began nearly 50 years ago, he was always disciplined, preserving an unequalled vocal technique by not straying beyond his range, which was mainly Verdi. If anyone could do a first Otello at 75, then perhaps he could. </p> <p>A few months ago, the word from Milan was that the incredible was happening. Bergonzi was deep in study of the score. He had even gone back to Verdi's villa near Parma to study the composer's own manuscript. Tentative enquiries from New York as to whether the great singer would prefer to sing the role transposed down - as even Placido Domingo now does - were met with a disdainful reply that Bergonzi intended to do the role \"tutto in tona\". </p> <p>Reports from the dress rehearsal increased the expectations. \"Bergonzi is thrilling,\" the conductor Eve Queler reported to the press. \"To think that this man could accomplish this at 75 is indeed a miracle,\" said New York opera buff Ed Rosen. </p> <p>That afternoon, straight after the rehearsal, I spoke to Bergonzi in his hotel overlooking Central Park. He oozed charm, discoursing authoritatively on Verdi and the tenor voice, breaking into song, in that long-remembered voice, to make a point. </p> <p>\"I accepted the challenge voluntarily, with happiness and joy,\" he said of Otello. \"After the rehearsal, many of the orchestra players said to me, 'Today we heard the Otello of Verdi for the first time.' That is all I want. All that I want is to do the best that I can and leave this as a last memory of a great career.\" </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the atmosphere at Carnegie Hall on the night of the concert was electric. Ticketless opera fans milled around on 57th Street hoping for returns. The hall was packed. The great ones were there for the occasion. Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras sat together in a box, drawing all eyes. James Levine arrived just as the doors were closing. </p> <p>As Queler launched her Opera Orchestra of New York into Otello's stormy opening, expectations could not have been higher. The side door opened and, to a smattering of excited applause, the familiar portly figure entered, marched to the front of the stage and delivered the Esultate, perhaps the most famous opening lines in the tenor repertoire. </p> <p>It was immediately apparent that there was something wrong. A grainy tone in the voice inhibited everything. Bergonzi strained audibly in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the high A that caps the triumphant entry phrase. As he walked off the stage again, one wondered what he must be saying under his breath. </p> <p>This underlying tension - so different from the glory days - lasted throughout act one. Bergonzi seemed in permanent danger of singing slightly flat, and would cup his left hand to his ear to help him stabilise any projected or exposed tone. The love duet, even with Kallen Esperian at her best, was strangely subdued. You could feel the audience willing him on, but maybe the expectations had made him too nervous. </p> <p>In retrospect, people said at the evening's end, maybe Bergonzi should have called it a day at that point, should have made his own announcement that he had tried, should have acknowledged that it was not working, and craved the audience's understanding for a situation they would have been only too willing to understand, however great their disappointment. </p> <p>But Bergonzi pressed on. Perhaps he felt that he owed it to himself, perhaps to the public. Perhaps he felt that he could sing his way through his difficulties and reclaim the old authority as the opera developed. </p> <p>If so, it was not to be. There was, though, one truly wonderful moment, where technique and musicianship came together in a passage of great vocal art. In the Ora e per sempre addio (\"now and forever farewell), Otello begins to understand that his glories are behind him. Normally, in defiance of the score, Otellos tend to go stentorian here. Not Bergonzi. As he told me beforehand, this passage is reflective. Verdi wrote it to be sung mostly softly, with a covered tone, rather than the big open sound that most tenors adopt. </p> <p>As the emotional temperature rose through act two, with Alberto Gazale an increasingly imposing Iago, Bergonzi seemed to struggle more and more. He was using his great art to try to conceal his difficulties, not illuminate his insights. Anything exposed was a high-wire act, and too often he slipped from the wire. By the end of act two, he looked an old man. </p> <p>When an official came on to the platform at the start of act three, we all knew what she was about to say. \"Mr Bergonzi is indisposed and will not continue his performance.\" Antonio Barasorda stood in, and did a good job in difficult circumstances. </p> <p>And so Carlo Bergonzi's great operatic career came to a sad, humbled end. The Bergonzi Otello was a grand dream, but it was not to be. The miracle of the ageless tenor did not happen. Only those who were at the dress rehearsal know how he sang Dio mi potevi, or the death scene. But at least, and perhaps appropriately, some of us also have the memory of his singing of Ora e per sempre addio.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Three Tenors all attend a concert, but only as part of the audience, then you know that something special is going on. And indeed, ever since the word got out that the revered tenor Carlo Bergonzi planned to sing his first and only performance of Verdi's Otello in New York at the age of 75 this month, seats for the Carnegie Hall event have been opera's hottest ticket of the year. It seemed incredible that a singer who quit the operatic stage more than a decade ago and who is at an age where even the most carefully preserved voice is a shadow of its former glory could still have the drive and the resources to undertake one of the most demanding roles in the operatic repertoire for the first time. Yet Bergonzi never did anything lightly. Throughout a career that began nearly 50 years ago, he was always disciplined, preserving an unequalled vocal technique by not straying beyond his range, which was mainly Verdi. If anyone could do a first Otello at 75, then perhaps he could. A few months ago, the word from Milan was that the incredible was happening. Bergonzi was deep in study of the score. He had even gone back to Verdi's villa near Parma to study the composer's own manuscript. Tentative enquiries from New York as to whether the great singer would prefer to sing the role transposed down - as even Placido Domingo now does - were met with a disdainful reply that Bergonzi intended to do the role \"tutto in tona\". Reports from the dress rehearsal increased the expectations. \"Bergonzi is thrilling,\" the conductor Eve Queler reported to the press. \"To think that this man could accomplish this at 75 is indeed a miracle,\" said New York opera buff Ed Rosen. That afternoon, straight after the rehearsal, I spoke to Bergonzi in his hotel overlooking Central Park. He oozed charm, discoursing authoritatively on Verdi and the tenor voice, breaking into song, in that long-remembered voice, to make a point. \"I accepted the challenge voluntarily, with happiness and joy,\" he said of Otello. \"After the rehearsal, many of the orchestra players said to me, 'Today we heard the Otello of Verdi for the first time.' That is all I want. All that I want is to do the best that I can and leave this as a last memory of a great career.\" Not surprisingly, the atmosphere at Carnegie Hall on the night of the concert was electric. Ticketless opera fans milled around on 57th Street hoping for returns. The hall was packed. The great ones were there for the occasion. Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras sat together in a box, drawing all eyes. James Levine arrived just as the doors were closing. As Queler launched her Opera Orchestra of New York into Otello's stormy opening, expectations could not have been higher. The side door opened and, to a smattering of excited applause, the familiar portly figure entered, marched to the front of the stage and delivered the Esultate, perhaps the most famous opening lines in the tenor repertoire. It was immediately apparent that there was something wrong. A grainy tone in the voice inhibited everything. Bergonzi strained audibly in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the high A that caps the triumphant entry phrase. As he walked off the stage again, one wondered what he must be saying under his breath. This underlying tension - so different from the glory days - lasted throughout act one. Bergonzi seemed in permanent danger of singing slightly flat, and would cup his left hand to his ear to help him stabilise any projected or exposed tone. The love duet, even with Kallen Esperian at her best, was strangely subdued. You could feel the audience willing him on, but maybe the expectations had made him too nervous. In retrospect, people said at the evening's end, maybe Bergonzi should have called it a day at that point, should have made his own announcement that he had tried, should have acknowledged that it was not working, and craved the audience's understanding for a situation they would have been only too willing to understand, however great their disappointment. But Bergonzi pressed on. Perhaps he felt that he owed it to himself, perhaps to the public. Perhaps he felt that he could sing his way through his difficulties and reclaim the old authority as the opera developed. If so, it was not to be. There was, though, one truly wonderful moment, where technique and musicianship came together in a passage of great vocal art. In the Ora e per sempre addio (\"now and forever farewell), Otello begins to understand that his glories are behind him. Normally, in defiance of the score, Otellos tend to go stentorian here. Not Bergonzi. As he told me beforehand, this passage is reflective. Verdi wrote it to be sung mostly softly, with a covered tone, rather than the big open sound that most tenors adopt. As the emotional temperature rose through act two, with Alberto Gazale an increasingly imposing Iago, Bergonzi seemed to struggle more and more. He was using his great art to try to conceal his difficulties, not illuminate his insights. Anything exposed was a high-wire act, and too often he slipped from the wire. By the end of act two, he looked an old man. When an official came on to the platform at the start of act three, we all knew what she was about to say. \"Mr Bergonzi is indisposed and will not continue his performance.\" Antonio Barasorda stood in, and did a good job in difficult circumstances. And so Carlo Bergonzi's great operatic career came to a sad, humbled end. The Bergonzi Otello was a grand dream, but it was not to be. The miracle of the ageless tenor did not happen. Only those who were at the dress rehearsal know how he sang Dio mi potevi, or the death scene. But at least, and perhaps appropriately, some of us also have the memory of his singing of Ora e per sempre addio.",

He's dreading the photo session. He tells me of the time he saw a photo of a desiccated old man who looked at least 100 on the front of a magazine and thought, who the hell is that? Then he realised it was him. No, he didn't think it was funny. He looks out of the window and points to a distant building hidden by trees. \"That's my flat,\" he says. \"This is the nearest a journalist ever gets to my flat.\" </p> <p>Wilson is best known as the grumpy old git from the long-running BBC comedy One Foot in the Grave. While the marketeers and strategic planners were telling telly executives the public wanted young, firm flesh starring in ever-so-cool projects, the unlikely Victor Meldrew drew bigger and bigger crowds until he was the biggest thing on telly. He hated change, hated getting old, and for some strange reason young people loved him. But there's a lesser-known Wilson: the avant-garde theatre director who only takes on embryonic works and nurtures them into existence. </p> <p>Today he's at the Aslef ballroom in Hampstead to rehearse a new play for the Royal Court. Mr Kolpert, written by David Gieselmann, has never been performed before and reads like a jamming session between Pinter, Beckett and Quentin Tarantino. </p> <p>We wander off through the streets, looking for coffee and bagels. A woman in a shop throws him a wide, knowing smile, which he returns. Must be an old friend. Who is she? \"I don't know. I pass the shop quite a lot. I wave back if people wave to me.\" </p> <p>He talks about the years before he was a professional actor when he worked as a laboratory technician, first in Scotland then in London. \"I used to have to take blood samples so a lot of people thought I was a doctor. I used to explain I wasn't, then it took so much time I didn't bother. Hello! Very well, thank you.\" Another attractive young woman, another familiar smile. He says he's never seen her in his life. </p> <p>When people see celebrities in the street they tend to nudge each other, or stare, or shout after they've passed. With Wilson, they simply say hello. Strangers accept him as an everyday part of life - old miseryguts who sits in the corner of the room with the telly. \"The extraordinary thing about One Foot in the Grave is that it's young people, children, who write to me.\" Do they tell him he's a horrible old man? \"No, they don't. By and large, they think Victor is very funny. I think what they like about him is that he says the things that kids want to say. He speaks out. Helloooo! \" </p> <p>Wilson, 63, has an ambivalent relationship with Meldrew. He detested the fact that he had been asked to play a pensioner when he was in his early 50s. He had never liked his appearance and this was the last straw. On the other hand, he says the writing is wonderful and it has made his fortune. </p> <p>I tell him my mum wants to know if he's as conservative as his voice and manner suggest. He looks at me, appalled, and repeats the word, sucking hard on the syllables then spitting them out. \" Con-ser-va-tive ? I'm really upset that she thinks I'm conservative. I think your mother's been listening to the wrong rumours.\" </p> <p>Politically, Wilson has in fact been a Labour party member for decades, and old Labour at that. He supported Ken Livingstone as mayor of London until he realised it would cost him his party membership. </p> <p>I tell him I've heard that when he escapes Victor he's a right little raver, dancing and drugging the nights away. This seems to cheer him up. \"I'm not going to tell you what kind of raver I am. He-he-he.\" He laughs like a slow-motion sneeze. \"When I get to a party I dance, provided I've got enough alcohol in me. I love dancing, I love music. Tell your mother I like parties. I go to a lot of parties.\" </p> <p>Wilson advocates the legalisation of cannabis, which he says is a great relaxant for rehearsals. But he says alcohol has been the most liberating factor in his life, that as a teenager and a young man he was rigid with Presbyterian inhibitions. \"There's no doubt about it: if it wasn't for alcohol I'd still be a lab tech in Greenock.\" He has three dry days a week. \"I used to drink every day and one day I thought, when did I last not have a drink? I couldn't remember. I used to drink a lot of spirits and I think I damaged my liver.\" </p> <p>Wilson takes acting and directing very seriously. He refers to the great Japanese director Ozu and his film Tokyo Story for inspiration - acting that isn't acting, just being. \"It was such a revelation to see a film talking about the mores of family life that a British film hadn't even smelt, not even got close to. The nuances of family relationships. It rang so true.\" Ozu's films focus on the gentle, irrevocable disillusionments of older age. \"I keep using this word in my directing - strangely enough, seeing I had this awful catchphrase - the word 'believability'. The actors must obey the text but in a real way, and the Japanese do that selflessly. The subtext of that world was so clearly worked out that if someone lifts a bagel it becomes a big moment, never mind a car chase.\" </p> <p>Why does he call Victor Meldrew's \"I don't believe it\" catchphrase awful? He looks embarrassed. \"I suppose you caught me out. I suppose only because I was talking of Ozu. The two seem so apart that it seems dreadful to talk about them in the same terms.\" </p> <p>Wilson is a Manchester United fan. We talk about football and for the first time he forgets this is an interview. He says the \"beautiful game\" is not that different from acting. \"To me good acting is about ensemble. There are no individual actors who interest me. Good acting to me is someone who'll work in a team. When a football team plays ensemble, that freedom of expression is wonderful. I'm very jealous of it.\" </p> <p>Despite his credentials as a raver there is something old-fashioned about Wilson. He has often been described as a \"confirmed bachelor\", a peculiarly archaic expression. \"I don't believe the word bachelor exists,\" he says. \"I realise my lifestyle is very strange to lots of people...\" Why? \"I just said I don't talk about my private life and you've just started talking about it again.\" Suddenly, he's accusing me of ulterior motives. \"You just chose the moment when we were getting very friendly and relaxed, talking about football...I don't find my life strange, but I realise I don't see myself as a 63-year-old Scottish actor \" </p> <p>What does that mean? Is \"confirmed bachelor\" a euphemism for being gay? \"You can make as many conjectures as you like, but I suppose my life is strange inasmuch as I'm a 63-year-old whose friends' age range is huge. I don't mix in older circles, by and large.\" Is that so strange? \"Well, a lot of older people want to be with older people all the time. I'm very happy to be with younger people. That keeps you fresh. It's good to have new ideas coming at you all the time. That's why I only do new writing.\" </p> <p>We're walking back to the ballroom and seem to be friends again. Why is he so protective of his private life? \"Because that is all I've got left. Helloooo. Hi, darling! How are you? All right! Mmmm! \" He plants a smacker on the face of Amanda, an actress from the play, who passes us in the street. \"Private life is what the public don't own.\" </p> <p>Wilson is such a funny mix - so open, so shut. An introverted extrovert or an extroverted introvert? The oldest swinger in town or the prude's prude? Yes, funny mix, fair enough,\" he says. \"I realise there is in some ways an enigma about me.\" </p> <p><strong>Richard Wilson: the life and works</strong></p> <p> Born July 9, 1936 in Greenock.

I tell him I've heard that when he escapes Victor he's a right little raver, dancing and drugging the nights away. This seems to cheer him up. \"I'm not going to tell you what kind of raver I am. He-he-he.\" He laughs like a slow-motion sneeze. \"When I get to a party I dance, provided I've got enough alcohol in me. I love dancing, I love music. Tell your mother I like parties. I go to a lot of parties.\" Wilson advocates the legalisation of cannabis, which he says is a great relaxant for rehearsals. But he says alcohol has been the most liberating factor in his life, that as a teenager and a young man he was rigid with Presbyterian inhibitions. \"There's no doubt about it: if it wasn't for alcohol I'd still be a lab tech in Greenock.\" He has three dry days a week. \"I used to drink every day and one day I thought, when did I last not have a drink? I couldn't remember. I used to drink a lot of spirits and I think I damaged my liver.\" Wilson takes acting and directing very seriously. He refers to the great Japanese director Ozu and his film Tokyo Story for inspiration - acting that isn't acting, just being. \"It was such a revelation to see a film talking about the mores of family life that a British film hadn't even smelt, not even got close to. The nuances of family relationships. It rang so true.\" Ozu's films focus on the gentle, irrevocable disillusionments of older age. \"I keep using this word in my directing - strangely enough, seeing I had this awful catchphrase - the word 'believability'. The actors must obey the text but in a real way, and the Japanese do that selflessly. The subtext of that world was so clearly worked out that if someone lifts a bagel it becomes a big moment, never mind a car chase.\" Why does he call Victor Meldrew's \"I don't believe it\" catchphrase awful? He looks embarrassed. \"I suppose you caught me out. I suppose only because I was talking of Ozu. The two seem so apart that it seems dreadful to talk about them in the same terms.\" Wilson is a Manchester United fan. We talk about football and for the first time he forgets this is an interview. He says the \"beautiful game\" is not that different from acting. \"To me good acting is about ensemble. There are no individual actors who interest me. Good acting to me is someone who'll work in a team. When a football team plays ensemble, that freedom of expression is wonderful. I'm very jealous of it.\" Despite his credentials as a raver there is something old-fashioned about Wilson. He has often been described as a \"confirmed bachelor\", a peculiarly archaic expression. \"I don't believe the word bachelor exists,\" he says. \"I realise my lifestyle is very strange to lots of people...\" Why? \"I just said I don't talk about my private life and you've just started talking about it again.\" Suddenly, he's accusing me of ulterior motives. \"You just chose the moment when we were getting very friendly and relaxed, talking about football...I don't find my life strange, but I realise I don't see myself as a 63-year-old Scottish actor \" What does that mean? Is \"confirmed bachelor\" a euphemism for being gay? \"You can make as many conjectures as you like, but I suppose my life is strange inasmuch as I'm a 63-year-old whose friends' age range is huge. I don't mix in older circles, by and large.\" Is that so strange? \"Well, a lot of older people want to be with older people all the time. I'm very happy to be with younger people. That keeps you fresh. It's good to have new ideas coming at you all the time. That's why I only do new writing.\" We're walking back to the ballroom and seem to be friends again. Why is he so protective of his private life? \"Because that is all I've got left. Helloooo. Hi, darling! How are you? All right! Mmmm! \" He plants a smacker on the face of Amanda, an actress from the play, who passes us in the street. \"Private life is what the public don't own.\" Wilson is such a funny mix - so open, so shut. An introverted extrovert or an extroverted introvert? The oldest swinger in town or the prude's prude? Yes, funny mix, fair enough,\" he says. \"I realise there is in some ways an enigma about me.\" Richard Wilson: the life and works Born July 9, 1936 in Greenock.

Its Department of Energy said it had serious concerns about the management approach taken by BNFL as it pulled out of a deal to turn radioactive waste into glass logs because of an \"outrageously expensive\" estimate to complete the operation. The company said last night it was \"disappointed\" by the announcement but would retender for the vitrification work which it now thought would cost nearly \u00a310bn , more than double the price two years ago. The contract for cleaning up waste kept in underground tanks at the Hanford weapons complex in Washington state was the most lucrative of a package arranged between the US department and BNFL Inc, a subsidiary, involving also plants in Colorado, Idaho, South Carolina and Tennessee. Bill Richardson, the US energy secretary, last week sent inspectors to BNFL's Sellafield complex to examine its safety record in the wake of rows with Japan and Germany and critical reports from Britain's nuclear installations inspec torate which helped provoke sweeping changes in the management of the company.

Payment for the work so far would probably be up to $300mn(\u00a3196m). It was not clear whether the government would have to pay a penalty for termination. BNFL, which blamed increased costs on ways of financing the project, said it was pleased the US authorities had found the design and technical solution for Hanford was sound. It would ensure a smooth transition could take place and hoped to continue to work with the energy department in delivering the important clean-up project.",

Student James Matthews, 25, was also ordered to pay \u00a3250 to compensate for the damage. He pleaded guilty at Horseferry Road magistrates' court in central London to intentionally or recklessly damaging the statue in Parliament Square. Alun Milford, prosecuting, said Matthews was photographed spraying the statue with red paint and his picture appeared in national newspapers. He presented himself at a police station in Cambridge on Sunday. Matthews, who defended himself, read a statement to the court in which he described Churchill as \"a reactionary politician who was imperialist and anti-semitic\". The ex-soldier, who served in Bosnia and Croatia, said he worked part time as a builder to pay for his degree course in English and European literature and philosophy at Anglia Polytechnic University in Cambridge. Asked by the stipendiary magistrate, Roger Davies, what he had hoped to achieve, he said: \"I thought that on a day when people all over the world are gathering to express basic human rights and freedom of expression it was acceptable to challenge an icon of the British establishment.\" Sentencing Matthews, Mr Davies said: \"Your actions caused a great affront to many British people and many people overseas.\" Anglia Polytechnic University said no decision had yet been taken on Matthews's future at the university.

His studies were interrupted by wartime enlistment in the Royal Air Force; by 1942, he was a pilot-instructor, based in Canada, and three years later he was flying bombers in Burma, after which his RAF career concluded with a spell in Transport Command.</p> <p>After the war, Fforde spent five years at Oxford University. He graduated with first-class honours in politics, philosophy and economics from Christ Church, and, at Nuffield College, chose central banking as the subject of his doctoral thesis, focusing on the United States federal reserve system. He joined the prime minister's statistical branch after the 1951 Conservative election victory, but maintained his links with academic economics, becoming a fellow of Nuffield College in 1953.</p> <p>In 1957, the Bank of England faced the task of preparing its submissions to the Radcliffe committee, set up to review the working of the monetary and financial system. Fforde was persuaded to join the bank, working alongside Maurice Allen, until then its only professional economist, but also having a close involvement on the Radcliffe work with Leslie O'Brien, the chief cashier.</p> <p>Among the recommendations of the report, published in 1959, was the proposal that the Bank of England should enhance its capacity for economic research and analysis, and do more to explain publicly its assessment of the state of the economy and the reasons for policy actions. Both tasks were entrusted to Fforde; he was made responsible for building up a small section of professional economists and for launching the bank's quarterly bulletin, of which he became editor-in-chief.</p> <p>Once these ventures were up and running, Fforde became available to play a wider role within the bank. In 1963, he went to the discount office, the bank's eyes and ears in the City, though still observ ing the top-hat rituals of the traditional money market. This move was something of a culture shock to all concerned, but Fforde's equability and dry humour, allied to his quickness of understanding, soon earned him the respect of his new audience.</p> <p>In 1966, O'Brien became governor of the bank, leaving the position of chief cashier open to his chosen successor, Fforde. The job had much wider-ranging responsibilities then than it does today, including all aspects of the implementation of monetary policy. For the next 16 years - from 1970 to 1982 as an executive director of the bank - the practical operation of monetary policy was Fforde's chief concern.</p> <p>To that task, he brought some clear guiding principles, but no ideological attachments. The period in the mid- to late-1960s - of heavy reliance on direct control over bank lending - convinced him that it should have no long-term place in the official armoury; its institutional consequences were too damaging, and its monetary effectiveness increasingly questionable.</p> <p>Fforde strongly supported the collection of good monetary data and its careful assessment and monitoring, but equally strongly opposed any idea that monetary relationships could be relied upon to provide simple rules for the conduct of policy. The erratic behaviour of broad money following the adoption in 1971 of competition and credit control, the reform which embodied the abandoning of lending controls in which he had been the prime mover, confirmed him in that view.</p> <p>Fforde supported the adoption of a target for broad money in the difficult years of the mid-1970s, though he was conscious that direct controls on banking balance sheets, then restored in a somewhat different form from the lending ceilings of the 1960s, could have a distorting effect on the target variable.</p> <p>He was much less happy with the approach of the incoming Conservative government in 1979, which made the delivery of a predetermined path for the growth of broad money the centrepiece of its economic policy. Direct control of banking balance sheets could no longer be effective following the removal of foreign exchange control at the end of 1979.</p> <p>Broad money grew massively and unpredictably, and the bank stood accused of a lack of resolve in pursuing monetary objectives - even though the evidence from the real economy was of unprecedented and undesired tightness. Fforde was probably relieved to be able, in 1982, to exchange operational responsibility for monetary policy for the role of policy adviser.</p> <p>On retiring in 1984, Fforde agreed to write the next volume of the bank's official history, covering its involvement in public policy issues from 1941 to 1958. This was a task for which he was well-equipped, bringing to it the qualities he had displayed during his service in the bank: perceptive analysis, great skill in drafting (albeit at the cost of much arduous labour), meticulousness, courage in reaching conclusions, and cogency of argument in presenting them. The Bank Of England And Public Policy (1941-1958) was published in 1992.</p> <p>In retirement, Fforde held directorships of Alexanders Discount, and its successor companies, and the Halifax Building Society.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Marya, and by their three sons and one daughter.</p> <p><b>John Standish Fforde, economist, born November 16 1921; died April 10 2000</b></p>",

His studies were interrupted by wartime enlistment in the Royal Air Force; by 1942, he was a pilot-instructor, based in Canada, and three years later he was flying bombers in Burma, after which his RAF career concluded with a spell in Transport Command. After the war, Fforde spent five years at Oxford University. He graduated with first-class honours in politics, philosophy and economics from Christ Church, and, at Nuffield College, chose central banking as the subject of his doctoral thesis, focusing on the United States federal reserve system. He joined the prime minister's statistical branch after the 1951 Conservative election victory, but maintained his links with academic economics, becoming a fellow of Nuffield College in 1953. In 1957, the Bank of England faced the task of preparing its submissions to the Radcliffe committee, set up to review the working of the monetary and financial system. Fforde was persuaded to join the bank, working alongside Maurice Allen, until then its only professional economist, but also having a close involvement on the Radcliffe work with Leslie O'Brien, the chief cashier. Among the recommendations of the report, published in 1959, was the proposal that the Bank of England should enhance its capacity for economic research and analysis, and do more to explain publicly its assessment of the state of the economy and the reasons for policy actions. Both tasks were entrusted to Fforde; he was made responsible for building up a small section of professional economists and for launching the bank's quarterly bulletin, of which he became editor-in-chief. Once these ventures were up and running, Fforde became available to play a wider role within the bank. In 1963, he went to the discount office, the bank's eyes and ears in the City, though still observ ing the top-hat rituals of the traditional money market. This move was something of a culture shock to all concerned, but Fforde's equability and dry humour, allied to his quickness of understanding, soon earned him the respect of his new audience. In 1966, O'Brien became governor of the bank, leaving the position of chief cashier open to his chosen successor, Fforde. The job had much wider-ranging responsibilities then than it does today, including all aspects of the implementation of monetary policy. For the next 16 years - from 1970 to 1982 as an executive director of the bank - the practical operation of monetary policy was Fforde's chief concern. To that task, he brought some clear guiding principles, but no ideological attachments. The period in the mid- to late-1960s - of heavy reliance on direct control over bank lending - convinced him that it should have no long-term place in the official armoury; its institutional consequences were too damaging, and its monetary effectiveness increasingly questionable. Fforde strongly supported the collection of good monetary data and its careful assessment and monitoring, but equally strongly opposed any idea that monetary relationships could be relied upon to provide simple rules for the conduct of policy. The erratic behaviour of broad money following the adoption in 1971 of competition and credit control, the reform which embodied the abandoning of lending controls in which he had been the prime mover, confirmed him in that view. Fforde supported the adoption of a target for broad money in the difficult years of the mid-1970s, though he was conscious that direct controls on banking balance sheets, then restored in a somewhat different form from the lending ceilings of the 1960s, could have a distorting effect on the target variable. He was much less happy with the approach of the incoming Conservative government in 1979, which made the delivery of a predetermined path for the growth of broad money the centrepiece of its economic policy. Direct control of banking balance sheets could no longer be effective following the removal of foreign exchange control at the end of 1979. Broad money grew massively and unpredictably, and the bank stood accused of a lack of resolve in pursuing monetary objectives - even though the evidence from the real economy was of unprecedented and undesired tightness. Fforde was probably relieved to be able, in 1982, to exchange operational responsibility for monetary policy for the role of policy adviser. On retiring in 1984, Fforde agreed to write the next volume of the bank's official history, covering its involvement in public policy issues from 1941 to 1958. This was a task for which he was well-equipped, bringing to it the qualities he had displayed during his service in the bank: perceptive analysis, great skill in drafting (albeit at the cost of much arduous labour), meticulousness, courage in reaching conclusions, and cogency of argument in presenting them. The Bank Of England And Public Policy (1941-1958) was published in 1992. In retirement, Fforde held directorships of Alexanders Discount, and its successor companies, and the Halifax Building Society. He is survived by his wife, Marya, and by their three sons and one daughter. John Standish Fforde, economist, born November 16 1921; died April 10 2000",

      "bodyText": "Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages in the Philippines are moving groups of captives around to confuse government forces and complicate efforts to secure their freedom, officials claimed yesterday. But they said hopes were high that a German woman who is ill could soon be freed, perhaps as early as today. Nur Misuari, a former rebel chief chosen by the government to be the chief negotiator, said that on Monday 12 hostages were moved a few miles from the thickly forested area on Jolo island where they have been kept since they were abducted from a Malaysian diving resort on April 23. Candido Casimoro, the police chief on Jolo, said the Abu Sayyaf rebels, who are fighting for a separate Islamic state, later regrouped the hostages. \"It was just a move to confuse the military,\" he said. Mr Misuari, who was due to go to Jolo, 600 miles south of Manila, early today, said he did not know where the other nine hostages were being held. The hostages - nine Malaysians, three Germans, two French, two South Africans, two Finns, two Filipinos and one Lebanese - have been kept in an Abu Sayyaf stronghold in Jolo's hilly interior. The area has been ringed by hundreds of troops and militia loyal to Mr Misuari while authorities make preliminary contact with the captors. As European and Libyan envoys joined Philippine efforts to end the crisis, there were signs that the German woman, Renate Wallert, could soon be freed. \"So far it's good,\" said President Joseph Estrada's envoy, Robert Aventajado, when asked about the prospects for the release of Ms Wallert, who has high blood pressure and has weakened in the jungle heat since being abducted. \"We have a jet on standby.\" Abdusakur Tan, the governor of Sulu province, said the emissaries hoped to send a doctor to retrieve Ms Wallert. \"Not necessarily today, maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after tomorrow,\" he said. \"We are optimistic about the outcome of the negotiations.\" After meeting Mr Estrada in Manila, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said he hoped for a breakthrough in the hostage crisis \"in the coming hours, in the coming days\". Mr Aventajado was joined on Jolo by a Libyan envoy, Rajab Azzarouq, who has experience of negotiating with rebels fighting to carve out a separate Islamic homeland in the southern Philippines. Government troops and local militia have sought to seal off the section of remote jungle where the rebels have been hiding with their captives, occasionally skirmishing with the government's forces. Mr Estrada's executive secretary, Ronaldo Zamora, said the troops did not intend to launch a rescue raid. \"We don't want to risk the lives that are at stake there,\" he said. \"We will not move. If we do that, it is like condemning them to death.\" In a letter to family members obtained by a cameraman who visited the hostages, the two South African hostages said they hoped that their government was pushing for their release. \"We are still OK, not eating healthy and under a lot of emotional stress, but we are praying (and preaching sometimes),\" Carel and Monique Strydom wrote. \"We will be back soon.\" Reuters",

      "bodyText": "Japanese police yesterday swooped on a cult guru accused of a bizarre foot-reading swindle that has netted its practitioners \u00a3500m. Hogen Fukunaga, the self-proclaimed reincarnation of Buddha and Christ, was arrested with 11 acolytes and charged with defrauding five women of 25m yen (\u00a3150,000). His detention marks the climax of a four-year investigation into the Ho-no-Hana Sanpogyo cult, which attracts followers by offering to diagnose their spiritual and mental health through an examination of their soles and toes. The followers paid 100,000 yen (\u00a3600 ) to have their feet stroked and scrutinised by Mr Fukunaga and other senior acolytes who claimed their powers were granted by a voice from heaven. Based on the colour of the skin and marks on the toes, the foot readers predicted that the victims would suffer such fates as dying from Aids or falling into debt, or that their children would commit suicide. A blemish on the big toe was said to indicate that the problem derived from the parents, on the second toe it was the grandparents and this pattern ran down to the little toe, where a mark indicated that today's problems could be traced to the follower's great-great-great grandparents. Almost every diagnosis pin pointed anguish and suffering, which was hardly surprising as the followers had to write down their problems before each consultation with the sole-readers. According to police, the sole-readers also followed a manual instructing them to make apocalyptic predictions that could only be averted by enrolling on three-day lecture sessions costing \u00a315,000 or by purchasing expensive religious scrolls or a pinch of Buddha's ashes for \u00a3120,000. \"I was told that if I did nothing I would die of cancer, but if I followed the voice of heaven, then I would be cured,\" one victim told police. Mr Fukunaga and his acolytes are believed to have taken in more than 22,000 people with the scam, netting themselves about 87bn yen (\u00a3512m) since the group was founded in 1987. The arrest appears to mark the end for the 55-year-old Mr Fukunaga, a former electrical engineer who liked to mix with the rich and famous. Ho-no-Hana's publications show the guru shaking hands with the Pope, Mother Teresa and Margaret Thatcher. Mr Fukunaga denied fraud, saying he was no longer responsible because he had given up his position as head of the cult in January. \"I was just obeying the voices of heaven, but now I cannot remember what they told me,\" he said. However, the arrest should not concern him too much - he has predicted that human beings will disappear from the Earth next January.

The UN peacekeeping mission was a disaster waiting to happen. Not only are the light-armed peacekeepers from east Africa, Jordan, India and Pakistan out of their depth in the unfamiliar terrain, but also there is hardly any real peace for them to keep.</p> <p>On a fact-finding mission to Sierra Leone last month, it was obvious that no weapons had been surrendered by either side.

If we can see the Paras cleaning up their act on sex, where's the good news on race? Why do we go on showing Africa that to be white is to have the money, the guns and the best escape route when Freetown, yet again, lies open to the vengeance and butchery of the RUF? We could undo some of the damage we ourselves perpetuate by being prepared to defend everyone who lives there. But only with fighters who are a lot less black than the rest of us. We seem much more likely to fly in some black chaps from another ex-colony instead. It is high time Robin Cook, not least with some help from Geoff Hoon, scrapped this shamefully ethnical foreign policy. Tom Snow London \u0095 You are right (Leader, May 8), the near total lack of international support for the Nigerian-led Ecomog peace enforcement efforts in Sierra Leone was simply criminal. The UN peacekeeping mission was a disaster waiting to happen. Not only are the light-armed peacekeepers from east Africa, Jordan, India and Pakistan out of their depth in the unfamiliar terrain, but also there is hardly any real peace for them to keep. On a fact-finding mission to Sierra Leone last month, it was obvious that no weapons had been surrendered by either side. While Freetown appeared calm, clashes between combatants of the opposing camps continued in areas close to the capital. Further north, close to the border with Liberia, hardly any ceasefire could be observed. Former combatants waiting to be disarmed in demilitarisation camps have been starved of food rations and other support. Proper risk assessment would have, for instance, led experts to question the level of control of Foday Sankoh and Johnny Koromah of the RUF over \"their\" combatants, particularly as some rebel field commanders are, for all intents and purposes, outside the peace process and under the protection of Charles Taylor in neighbouring Liberia. The abductions could well be the ex-combatants' way of posting statements about their neglect. It could also imply the existence of multiple centres of control over combatants.

There was a rare, possibly sentimental, return for Nigel Winterburn at left-back as Wenger shuffled his defensive pack, resting Tony Adams and inserted Oleg Luzhny in central defence. </p> <p>With Dennis Bergkamp starting on the bench Henry largely foraged alone up front, with Nwankwo Kanu in support. It was the prolific French striker who created an opening for himself after a desultory first half-hour. </p> <p>There was little hint of danger to Wednesday's defence when Henry seized on a loose ball, sized up the opportunity and let fly from 25 yards with a low shot.

      "bodyText": "Sheffield Wednesday were finally relegated to the Nationwide First Division last night but not before an amazing fightback had seen them almost snatch a Premiership lifeline. The noise emanating from Wednesday's travelling brass band belied the seriousness of the task of their team, who surprisingly saw their leading scorer Gilles De Bilde relegated to the bench and Andy Booth and the youngster Alan Quinn entrusted with the striking duties. Arsenal - and their supporters - were in relaxed mood on a sultry evening, tensions eased by the certainty of second place and a Champions League berth. There was a rare, possibly sentimental, return for Nigel Winterburn at left-back as Wenger shuffled his defensive pack, resting Tony Adams and inserted Oleg Luzhny in central defence. With Dennis Bergkamp starting on the bench Henry largely foraged alone up front, with Nwankwo Kanu in support. It was the prolific French striker who created an opening for himself after a desultory first half-hour. There was little hint of danger to Wednesday's defence when Henry seized on a loose ball, sized up the opportunity and let fly from 25 yards with a low shot. Kevin Pressman was utterly beaten, but the ball rebounded from the near post. Wednesday's sole response in the first half was a Booth header that David Seaman caught almost nonchalantly. It was a rare foray by a side whose shortage of goal power has plagued them all season. Pressman was not seriously troubled, either, for most of the first half although he had to be alert to stop another sudden, low shot from the left, this time from Gilles Grimandi. Arsenal's first-half goal, when it did come, arrived from an unlikely source. Henry closed to the left byline, swept in a quick, low cross that eluded two defenders and a stretching Pressman but Dixon managed to retrieve the ball close to the right byline and from a most unpromising position managed to squeeze it into the net. Bergkamp replaced Parlour at half-time and the Dutch international began the second period by curling a free-kick straight at Pressman. Finally the Owls made the necessary change, bringing on Gerald Sibon and Gilles De Bilde on 56 minutes for Haslam and Sonner. It proved to be the most astute substitution of the season - and possibly Shreeves's career - as both players scored within four minutes of coming on. Sibon scored with his first touch, climbing above Vieira to head home Wim Jonk's cross after 58 minutes. And just two minutes later De Bilde stunned Highbury with an amazing second, playing a one-two with Booth, nutmegging Keown in the process, before slotting the ball past Seaman into the far corner. The Wednesday management were up off the bench and De Bilde made his feelings about being dropped clear, gesturing wildly to the bench and punching the air furiously as his team-mates tried to congratulate him. There was still more drama to come as Bergkamp flashed a shot just wide before Sibon wasted a glorious opportunity to make it 3-1. Seaman fumbled Jonk's drive into the path of Sibon who, after trying to chip the prone goalkeeper, got a second chance but, with the net gaping, hit the near post from a matter of yards. Unbelievably the visitors then went 3-1 ahead when Alan Quinn collected De Bilde's through-ball, springing the offside trap, before rounding Seaman and stroking the ball into the empty net. Substitute Silvinho made sure the Wednesday fans were in for an anxious final 12 minutes with his first goal for Arsenal, rifling a superb 25-yard shot into the top corner to make it 3-2. And with just 10 minutes left Wednesday were once again on the brink of relegation as Henry added the latest twist to an extraordinary match. Bergkamp fed Overmars down the left and when the ball was pulled back Henry fired in his 26th goal of the season from just inside the left-hand edge of the area.",

This week, for instance, I was out of the office doing operational readiness checks and I found myself on an exercise on Loch Ness, at 9 o'clock on a Wednesday night with the wind blowing and heavy rain. But my worst experience has been the evacuation of a passenger vessel. This part of the world is the southern terminus for the UK's longest ferry journey, from Aberdeen to Lerwick, so you've got two ferries a night with potentially 600 people on each. We're always within 45 minutes of the operations centre, contactable on a pager and a mobile phone. </p> <p>I'm responsible for the supervision, operation and administration of our district, stretching from Arbroath up the east coast to Helmsdale, near Wick. We have to ensure the operational readiness of teams up and down the coast in preparation for a search and rescue operation. You're looking at 800 incidents a year, ranging from children stuck on cliffs all the way up to oil-related accidents or a Piper Alpha-type situation. </p> <p>I started as a coastguard up in Shetland 14 years ago. Initially I was a deck officer in the merchant navy but that was a single man's post and things change. When I decided to come ashore and start a family, I was looking to continue my career in a post in which my previous experience could be put to good use. Nowadays we have people from all sorts of backgrounds - straight from school or college or university. </p> <p>I find the money extremely tight. I have three children, we take a short holiday each year and I drive an F-reg Sierra - 100,000 miles on the clock. But at the end of the week, I do feel as if it's been worthwhile. I feel I am making a difference as part of a team, sometimes saving lives, and I do get a buzz out of that. </p> <p><strong> Joel Hawkins, nurse: </strong>Age 31, clinical charge nurse at the Royal Maudsley Hospital's eating disorders unit</p> <p>Getting people back into a healthier way of eating is one of the key parts of treatment at the unit, so if I get in at 7am, the first thing we do is have breakfast. Then there are snacks at 10 and dinner at 12. It's a busy day - meals, one-to-one therapy, teaching students - and it can be stressful: we treat people who have been ill for, on average, six years, and the nature of the conditions is that both patients and their relatives become incredibly distressed. Progress is measured in small amounts. </p> <p>I don't come from a family of nurses - my interest probably stems from watching medical documentaries as a child. I thought the idea of someone choosing not to eat was endlessly fascinating - it's such a powerful thing, expressing such a level of distress, and is an area of psychology in which there are still many questions and not enough answers. It's a voyage of discovery, you and the patient learning together. </p> <p>I'm married, with a child due in September, so I'm very conscious of my pay and of being able to provide. For what I do, with 17 patients, staff and relatives if they're on the ward - well, it's a lot of responsibility for 20-odd grand a year. It's never enough, but it's certainly not enough for my level of responsibility. I can't have holidays every year and I have to drive a fairly old car. That's one of the unfortunate things about nursing: you have to make compromises. </p> <p>But I'm very committed to what I'm doing now. I could go and work in the private sector, but I have a very strong attachment to the health service: it's trained me and it's given me the most diverse experiences. And there's the age-old thing with nurses - you have a feeling of duty and that's what keeps you going. </p> <p><strong> Pippa Smith, trainee solicitor: </strong>Age 24, works at Beachcroft Wansbroughs Solicitors</p> <p>I have wanted to be a lawyer for a long, long time, but I didn't always think I would want to be a solicitor. Until my first year in university, I wanted to be a barrister, but even then I could see that it's a very financially insecure occupation. As a solicitor, you are more stable because you're somebody's employee. </p> <p>I work in employment law. I get in at about 9.15 in the morning, but there isn't really a typical pattern after that: I can never plan or structure my day because I work at the whim of the people in the department. But I do enjoy my job: it changes every day and there is a great deal of interaction with the rest of the team - which is another good reason not to be a barrister. When our work involves employees who are subject to disciplinary action because of their conduct, things can get quite high-profile, too. </p> <p>As a trainee, you don't have complete control over specific cases and files. I have lots of responsibility, though - drafting letters, faxes and clauses, and amending contracts. There's a lot of attending meetings, too. As a trainee, you don't contribute all that much at these but you do take word-for-word attendance notes, which can be a bit boring and is a nightmare because you can never get everything down. </p> <p>The money is enough to live on. I'm very lucky, mind you, because I live at home and so I don't have to pay rent. I have one major holiday a year and a few weekends away as well. I enjoy working in London - I think you get high-quality clients and I like the after-work socialising mentality, which I don't think exists everywhere - but I'm pretty sure it would be a struggle to afford to do the things I want to do if I had to pay for my own place here. </p> <p> <strong>Thomas Burmester, web producer: </strong>Age 24, works on web production for BBC Online and lives in London</p> <p>We get commissioned to produce websites for different parts of the BBC - there's a whole team involved, of designers, coders, sub-editors - and if it all goes like clockwork, then these elements are combined to make the site. The last one I did was for BBC Knowledge and it was full of interactive case studies, business theories and business gurus expanding on their particular subjects, from entrepreneurialism to change management to personnel. </p> <p>I don't have any plans to become an internet entrepreneur. I've gone through phases where I thought maybe that would be an option, but right now I'm doing something useful, so I don't have the kind of crises you maybe get in other jobs where you think: \"What have I been doing for the past six months?\" It's in the nature of the job that at the end of each project, there's something there that wasn't there when you started and because they're all educational sites, there is obviously an educational value, too. Working in this particular industry is exciting at the moment - there's no such thing as a typical working day. </p> <p>As for money, I got a raise recently, which has made things a lot easier, but even I'm having difficulty and I have no dependants or anything. I don't run a car and as for bar prices and things like that - well, I grew up in London, so I'm used to them. </p> <p>What really bothers me is the cost of housing. I just rented a property yesterday and it's extortionate, it really is. I do sometimes wonder what would happen if I went and worked abroad, then wanted to return to London because it's my home - would I be able to afford to? If I don't buy a place now, am I ever going to be able to come back?</p>",

The last one I did was for BBC Knowledge and it was full of interactive case studies, business theories and business gurus expanding on their particular subjects, from entrepreneurialism to change management to personnel. I don't have any plans to become an internet entrepreneur. I've gone through phases where I thought maybe that would be an option, but right now I'm doing something useful, so I don't have the kind of crises you maybe get in other jobs where you think: \"What have I been doing for the past six months?\" It's in the nature of the job that at the end of each project, there's something there that wasn't there when you started and because they're all educational sites, there is obviously an educational value, too. Working in this particular industry is exciting at the moment - there's no such thing as a typical working day. As for money, I got a raise recently, which has made things a lot easier, but even I'm having difficulty and I have no dependants or anything. I don't run a car and as for bar prices and things like that - well, I grew up in London, so I'm used to them. What really bothers me is the cost of housing. I just rented a property yesterday and it's extortionate, it really is. I do sometimes wonder what would happen if I went and worked abroad, then wanted to return to London because it's my home - would I be able to afford to? If I don't buy a place now, am I ever going to be able to come back?",

      "body": "<p>The government plans to raise basic state pensions by \u00a34 or \u00a35 a week next spring in an attempt to win back disaffected older voters before the general election. </p> <p>Though ministers are not prepared to restore the link between pensions and earnings, they are increasingly aware that last winter's 75p increase on a single person's pension backfired badly in last week's elections and accept that the \u00a32 to \u00a33 a week increase expected in next winter's inflation-linked increase will not be enough. </p> <p>Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, are adamant that they will not sacrifice Labour's strategic goal of giving most extra cash to those pensioners in greatest need. But Mr Darling's officials are working on plans to increase the basic pension by more than inflation in April 2001. </p> <p>The device now favoured at the Department of Social Security is one which would increase the winter fuel allowance still further above the \u00a3150 payment to all pensioner households which Mr Brown announced in his fourth budget last March. </p> <p>Part of the increased allowance - perhaps to \u00a3200 or more - would then be consolidated into the basic pension. That would produce a \u00a34 to \u00a35 a week increase for single pensioners instead of the \u00a32 to \u00a33 which inflation trends currently indicate. </p> <p>Treasury officials said last night that no final agreement on how best to tackle the pensions issue had yet been reached. </p> <p>Although the pensions minister, Jeff Rooker, made a robust defence of the government's policy of targeting all extra money on the bottom one fifth of poorest pensioners - many of them over 75 - there are signals in Whitehall that the government is making hasty plans to increase the basic pension. </p> <p>This contradicts Mr Brown's declared aim to focus extra funds where they are needed most, via his minimum income guarantee which has provided up to \u00a320 a week extra for a million of the poorest pensioners. </p> <p>\"We are not going to be buffeted by short-term difficulties,\" one Brown adviser said last night. </p> <p>But linking the minimum income guarantee to earnings not prices has caused other problems. It will continue to rise faster over the years, helping the poorest to catch up but that may create resentment among those pensioners with some savings or small occupational pensions. They will feel penalised for thrift without the adjustments - notably the new pension credit - which Mr Darling is devising. </p> <p>The idea is that the government redistributes money between pensioners because their incomes have becomemore unequal than among the rest of the population. Pensioner groups, including Age Concern, have campaigned for the restoration of the link betweeen basic pension and earnings, which was broken 20 years ago by Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>But the chancellor this week said his total spending on increasing pensions has cost the state \u00a3800 more than if the government had re-established the earnings link. </p> <p>Although the basic pension will rise above inflation next April under the Darling plan, the government will be able to claim it has not abandoned its policy. </p> <p>Changes will be announced in November in the annual benefit uprating.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government plans to raise basic state pensions by \u00a34 or \u00a35 a week next spring in an attempt to win back disaffected older voters before the general election. Though ministers are not prepared to restore the link between pensions and earnings, they are increasingly aware that last winter's 75p increase on a single person's pension backfired badly in last week's elections and accept that the \u00a32 to \u00a33 a week increase expected in next winter's inflation-linked increase will not be enough. Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, the social security secretary, are adamant that they will not sacrifice Labour's strategic goal of giving most extra cash to those pensioners in greatest need. But Mr Darling's officials are working on plans to increase the basic pension by more than inflation in April 2001. The device now favoured at the Department of Social Security is one which would increase the winter fuel allowance still further above the \u00a3150 payment to all pensioner households which Mr Brown announced in his fourth budget last March. Part of the increased allowance - perhaps to \u00a3200 or more - would then be consolidated into the basic pension. That would produce a \u00a34 to \u00a35 a week increase for single pensioners instead of the \u00a32 to \u00a33 which inflation trends currently indicate. Treasury officials said last night that no final agreement on how best to tackle the pensions issue had yet been reached. Although the pensions minister, Jeff Rooker, made a robust defence of the government's policy of targeting all extra money on the bottom one fifth of poorest pensioners - many of them over 75 - there are signals in Whitehall that the government is making hasty plans to increase the basic pension. This contradicts Mr Brown's declared aim to focus extra funds where they are needed most, via his minimum income guarantee which has provided up to \u00a320 a week extra for a million of the poorest pensioners. \"We are not going to be buffeted by short-term difficulties,\" one Brown adviser said last night. But linking the minimum income guarantee to earnings not prices has caused other problems. It will continue to rise faster over the years, helping the poorest to catch up but that may create resentment among those pensioners with some savings or small occupational pensions. They will feel penalised for thrift without the adjustments - notably the new pension credit - which Mr Darling is devising. The idea is that the government redistributes money between pensioners because their incomes have becomemore unequal than among the rest of the population. Pensioner groups, including Age Concern, have campaigned for the restoration of the link betweeen basic pension and earnings, which was broken 20 years ago by Margaret Thatcher. But the chancellor this week said his total spending on increasing pensions has cost the state \u00a3800 more than if the government had re-established the earnings link. Although the basic pension will rise above inflation next April under the Darling plan, the government will be able to claim it has not abandoned its policy. Changes will be announced in November in the annual benefit uprating.",

      "body": "<p>Rover's giant Longbridge complex was dramatically rescued yesterday, reprieving thousands of car jobs in the West Midlands and defusing an industrial and political crisis. </p> <p>Jubiliant workers at the Birmingham site celebrated after BMW agreed to sell its factory to the Phoenix consortium for a symbolic \u00a310 and to fund \u00a3575m to cover running costs - though whether the money was a loan or a gift was being disputed last night. </p> <p>But as Tony Blair and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, welcomed the agreement, Ford was preparing to announce tomorrow night that car production is to end at its plant at Dagenham, east London, with the loss of 3,000 jobs. </p> <p>The Ford decision underlines the shaky state of the British motor industry, which is being buffeted by the strong pound and massive international over-capacity. </p> <p>And despite yesterday's relief in the West Midlands some experts remain sceptical about the long-term prospects for the Phoenix plan. </p> <p>The sudden completion of the BMW-Phoenix deal was as dramatic as last month's collapse of talks with the venture capitalists Alchemy and the German company's original announcement two months ago. Closure of Longbridge could have led to the loss of 24,000 jobs in a region that contains a number of Labour constituencies. </p> <p>The Phoenix plan envisages that redundancies at Longbridge would be below 1,000, with up to \u00a325,000 offered to workers who lose their jobs. </p> <p>Mr Towers made clear that Phoenix, which intends to build about 200,000 cars a year, is seeking a partner and confirmed that Honda of Japan has already been approached.

      "bodyText": "Rover's giant Longbridge complex was dramatically rescued yesterday, reprieving thousands of car jobs in the West Midlands and defusing an industrial and political crisis. Jubiliant workers at the Birmingham site celebrated after BMW agreed to sell its factory to the Phoenix consortium for a symbolic \u00a310 and to fund \u00a3575m to cover running costs - though whether the money was a loan or a gift was being disputed last night. But as Tony Blair and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, welcomed the agreement, Ford was preparing to announce tomorrow night that car production is to end at its plant at Dagenham, east London, with the loss of 3,000 jobs. The Ford decision underlines the shaky state of the British motor industry, which is being buffeted by the strong pound and massive international over-capacity. And despite yesterday's relief in the West Midlands some experts remain sceptical about the long-term prospects for the Phoenix plan. The sudden completion of the BMW-Phoenix deal was as dramatic as last month's collapse of talks with the venture capitalists Alchemy and the German company's original announcement two months ago. Closure of Longbridge could have led to the loss of 24,000 jobs in a region that contains a number of Labour constituencies. The Phoenix plan envisages that redundancies at Longbridge would be below 1,000, with up to \u00a325,000 offered to workers who lose their jobs. Mr Towers made clear that Phoenix, which intends to build about 200,000 cars a year, is seeking a partner and confirmed that Honda of Japan has already been approached. He also signalled that state aid is likely in the future to retool Longbridge and design new models. \"What we're looking for from the government is strong support, but not support in terms of massive state aid,\" said Mr Towers. \"That would be folly and is not the way we've put our plan together.\" He said the aim was to make Phoenix profitable in two years. The prime minister congratulated Mr Byers, who had to lobby BMW initially. Up to 60% of the new company is to be owned by the workforce and dealers, with about a quarter of the shares likely to be offered to employees through a Treasury-backed scheme. The workforce at Cowley fear they could pay a high price for Longbridge's survival. The Rover 75 executive model is to be transferred to the West Midlands, leaving the Oxfordshire plant without a car until the new Mini comes on stream next summer. BMW said yesterday there would be no redundancies and any production shortfall would be covered by flexible shift patterns which allow for shorter hours when work is slack and longer hours when demand picks up.

      "bodyText": "Graeme le Saux, out for almost eight months, has been given an even greater incentive to return for Chelsea after Kevin Keegan virtually guaranteed the left-back a place in the England squad for Euro 2000 if he proves his fitness before the end of the season. An ankle injury has sidelined the 31-year-old Le Saux since October but he has an outside chance of featuring in Chelsea's final league game, against Derby on Sunday, six days before the FA Cup final against Aston Villa. Keegan said yesterday: \"I'll be absolutely delighted if he is considered fit enough to play in the Cup final, or in one league game and then the Cup final. If he was fit then, there's no doubt about it, he would be in the squad. \"The door is still open for Graeme. He's a left-sided player and we haven't got an abundance of them. \"I would say if he proves his fitness then I can make a judgment on that, just like I will with Robbie Fowler. \"We must remember England have three games as well before Euro 2000. Anybody only playing one game before the end of the season will actually have four games before the tournament.\" The news will be heartening for Le Saux, who has started only 10 Chelsea matches this season and recently admitted it was \"unlikely\" he would have enough games to prove his fitness before Keegan names his squad on June 1. England's first-choice left-back in France 98 has not played competitively since suffering ankle tendon trouble against Arsenal in October and has had two operations with as many comeback dates unfulfilled. But he recently started running again and his availability would offer Keegan a valuable option in what has been a notorious problem position for England. England have warm-up friendlies against Brazil and Ukraine at Wembley after the FA Cup final before Keegan names the 22-man squad who will travel to Belgium and the Netherlands for Euro 2000, which starts on June 10. Before their first game, against Portugal on June 12, Keegan's men travel to Malta for a final friendly international. Sol Campbell has ended speculation about his future by saying he will stay at Tottenham next season, according to Spurs' director of football David Pleat. The England centre-back has been continually linked with a \u00a315m move to Manchester United but Pleat said the captain plans to see out his contract, which expires after next season, and is in negotiations over a new deal. David Ginola, angry at being dropped at Manchester United on Saturday, will be assured he has a future at Tottenham when he meets the manager George Graham this week. \"David has an important part to play for Tottenham next season,\" Graham said. \"I want him to stay.\" But he will tell the Frenchman that he has to accept that he cannot start all matches. Manchester United yesterday told Massimo Taibi, the goalkeeper bought from Venezia last August for \u00a34.3m but who made only four first-team appearances, that his future lies in Italy. He is currently on loan with Reggina.",

There were many features of this exercise that were unprecedented in British politics, and the terminology used was stolen wholly, without explanation, apology or thought, from the United States.</p> <p>Traditionally, Americans have always run for office, while British politicians have stood . This was, I like to think, a sign of our seemliness and reticence; it is unBritish to rush after power too energetically. For anyone who grew up with the politics in the 1960s the distinction was obvious. When your leading politicians were as languid as Harold Macmillan, as effete as Sir Alec Douglas-Home, as podgy as Harold Wilson and as falling-down drunk as George Brown, the notion of them running for anything was unthinkable. Across the Atlantic, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon were more vibrant. The mayoral contest changed everything. From the start, the question was: would Ken Run?</p> <p>Alongside that came the new and equally unBritish concept of the running-mate - employed on a daily basis to explain the relationship between Trevor Phillips, Labour's candidate for deputy mayor, and Frank Dobson. Now, this is one of those phrases with which I have a peculiar personal problem. In my mind - even in the customary US context - it always conjures up an image of a couple of eight-year-old girls skipping hand-in-hand over the hills with daisy chains in their hair. This is bad enough when applied to, say, Clinton and Gore, but when Frank infiltrates the image, you will understand that it becomes truly terrifying. Admittedly, standing-mate would sound very strange, but even so...</p> <p>Then there was the question of the ticket . Vote the straight Labour ticket, people were enjoined. This usage of straight is itself an Americanism. Ticket certainly is. I think its first regular appearance in Britain was in 1983 when Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley emerged as leader and deputy leader of the Labour party, a combination which (bizarrely enough) was described as the dream ticket .</p> <p>After he had won, the mayor was asked whether he wanted to be called your honour, which gave him a chance to go into people's-Ken mode and say of course not. But our mayors are traditionally known as your worship (which sounds just a little less weird when you twig that the word is a corruption of worth + ship). Given the separation of powers in the new set-up, and the US-style balance that will exist between the mayor and the government, the assembly and the London boroughs, the process is probably not over yet. There will be log-rolling and the pork-barrel before we are done.</p> <p>Now, of course, language must import or die, but the trading does seem to have become rather one-way of late. Even lobbyist is a newish word in Britain, though it goes back to the 1820s in the US, when special pleaders were barred from the New York state legislature, but allowed to hang around the lobby (like our own lobby correspondents). Spin doctor, a phrase which has overtones of baseball, is also American, and only came into common usage here in the mid-1980s, after the dream ticket took over the Labour party.</p> <p>According to Bill Bryson (whose marvellous books on the language, Made in America and Mother Tongue, will be read long after his engagingly meretricious travel stuff has been forgotten), we did give them lame duck , an 18th-century term for a stock-market defaulter. And dark horse came from Disraeli's novel The Young Duke. But he actually meant it originally in a horse-racing context rather than a political one.</p> <p>Now, however, the exports seemed to have dried up while America's ugliest words infest our media. Every burglary is a heist. Every wage increase is a hike, which - as far as I am concerned - is a long walk. Most horrible of all is rookie (a corruption of recruit), which has travelled like some deadly virus from the US military into British sports journalism, carried, I suspect, in the baggage of the golfing writers and now being applied to mean any inexperienced sportsman. These are words that would never ever be spoken in any British conversation, which is what makes their use so ludicrous. I can't stand this kind of thing. Or do I have to say I can't run it?</p> <p>Thanks for all your entries to our Easter Tuesday quiz. I thought it was pretty easy myself, but then I knew all along that Fact No. 9 was the rogue. The Arami tribe of Ghana is a figment, and the stuff about them being poisoned by the potassium in bananas utter nonsense. Plausible nonsense, evidently, because another large entry produced only a small crop of correct answers. The Fetzer Bonterra organic wine goes to June Brown of Eltham.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk\">matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</a></p>",

For anyone who grew up with the politics in the 1960s the distinction was obvious. When your leading politicians were as languid as Harold Macmillan, as effete as Sir Alec Douglas-Home, as podgy as Harold Wilson and as falling-down drunk as George Brown, the notion of them running for anything was unthinkable. Across the Atlantic, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon were more vibrant. The mayoral contest changed everything. From the start, the question was: would Ken Run? Alongside that came the new and equally unBritish concept of the running-mate - employed on a daily basis to explain the relationship between Trevor Phillips, Labour's candidate for deputy mayor, and Frank Dobson. Now, this is one of those phrases with which I have a peculiar personal problem. In my mind - even in the customary US context - it always conjures up an image of a couple of eight-year-old girls skipping hand-in-hand over the hills with daisy chains in their hair. This is bad enough when applied to, say, Clinton and Gore, but when Frank infiltrates the image, you will understand that it becomes truly terrifying. Admittedly, standing-mate would sound very strange, but even so... Then there was the question of the ticket . Vote the straight Labour ticket, people were enjoined. This usage of straight is itself an Americanism. Ticket certainly is. I think its first regular appearance in Britain was in 1983 when Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley emerged as leader and deputy leader of the Labour party, a combination which (bizarrely enough) was described as the dream ticket . After he had won, the mayor was asked whether he wanted to be called your honour, which gave him a chance to go into people's-Ken mode and say of course not. But our mayors are traditionally known as your worship (which sounds just a little less weird when you twig that the word is a corruption of worth + ship). Given the separation of powers in the new set-up, and the US-style balance that will exist between the mayor and the government, the assembly and the London boroughs, the process is probably not over yet. There will be log-rolling and the pork-barrel before we are done. Now, of course, language must import or die, but the trading does seem to have become rather one-way of late. Even lobbyist is a newish word in Britain, though it goes back to the 1820s in the US, when special pleaders were barred from the New York state legislature, but allowed to hang around the lobby (like our own lobby correspondents). Spin doctor, a phrase which has overtones of baseball, is also American, and only came into common usage here in the mid-1980s, after the dream ticket took over the Labour party. According to Bill Bryson (whose marvellous books on the language, Made in America and Mother Tongue, will be read long after his engagingly meretricious travel stuff has been forgotten), we did give them lame duck , an 18th-century term for a stock-market defaulter. And dark horse came from Disraeli's novel The Young Duke. But he actually meant it originally in a horse-racing context rather than a political one. Now, however, the exports seemed to have dried up while America's ugliest words infest our media. Every burglary is a heist. Every wage increase is a hike, which - as far as I am concerned - is a long walk. Most horrible of all is rookie (a corruption of recruit), which has travelled like some deadly virus from the US military into British sports journalism, carried, I suspect, in the baggage of the golfing writers and now being applied to mean any inexperienced sportsman. These are words that would never ever be spoken in any British conversation, which is what makes their use so ludicrous. I can't stand this kind of thing. Or do I have to say I can't run it? Thanks for all your entries to our Easter Tuesday quiz. I thought it was pretty easy myself, but then I knew all along that Fact No. 9 was the rogue. The Arami tribe of Ghana is a figment, and the stuff about them being poisoned by the potassium in bananas utter nonsense. Plausible nonsense, evidently, because another large entry produced only a small crop of correct answers. The Fetzer Bonterra organic wine goes to June Brown of Eltham. matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk",

Now there could be big changes ahead for the capital. </p> <p> <strong> Why does London need a mayor?</strong> </p> <p> A city as large as London, with a population of over 7 million people, needs someone with an overview of how things are organised - most other capital cities do. Many London services such as education will go on being run by the borough councils, but there are over 32 of these. The mayor will need to ensure the councils work together and to battle for extra money for them from the government.

People may have to start paying a special congestion charge if they want to enter central London in a car. </p> <p>A big effort will go into making buses and tubes more efficient. More conductors may appear on buses, and fares may be frozen or cut. The network of bicycle lanes will probably be increased. Other changes will include Trafalgar and Parliament Squares being made car-free and a giant glass building in the shape of an egg near London Bridge. This will be the mayor's headquarters and will house the London Assembly, also elected last week. </p> <p> <strong> What will the mayor be able to do for the environment?</strong> </p> <p>The mayor is expected to draw up a special biodiversity plan for London to be used to safeguard and encourage its animal and plantlife. Over 115 kinds of fish live in the Thames which may gain special protection. Proposals to develop marshland to the east of the city may be shelved and the mayor may push for the creation of some 10,000 environmental jobs by 2005 - the date of the election for the next London mayor. </p> <p>On average each London household produces about a tonne of rubbish a year - an issue to be taken up by the mayor to boost our current recycling rate of 6 per cent. In some cities, such as Barcelona, over a quarter of household waste is recycled. </p> <p> <strong> Homelessness is bad in London - will the mayor tackle this?</strong> </p> <p> The mayor can ask the government to hand over more money to help build what is called \"social housing\" - flats and houses available at a reasonable rent. There may be as many as 100,000 empty homes in London which the mayor might help bring back into use. </p> <p> <strong> What amount of money will the mayor have to spend?</strong> </p> <p> The mayor has no powers to raise cash through taxes. Some people fear many promises of what will be done after the election rely on extra money from central government which may not be available. However, the mayor will be a powerful force to advance London's cause when money is being divided up. </p> <p>He will have \u00a33.6bn a year to hand out to several new groups such as the London Development Agency, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority and the Metropolitan Police Authority. But this is not \"new\" money since it has been diverted to the mayor from local councils that used to distribute it. If enough assembly members dislike the mayor's budget, they can change it. </p> <p>But despite these controls, the mayor really does have the \"biggest job in London\". The capital is a complex place. Its huge population needs housing, jobs, education and entertainment. It must provide efficient transport and clean air, effective police forces and good hospitals. It must cope with rush hours and tourist seasons, demonstrations and celebrations.

      "body": "<p><strong>WHERE IN THE WORLD IS FAUSTINO ASPRILLA?</strong></p> <p>Colombia's Radionet radio has never heard anything like it. Carlos Valderrama and his crazy, crazy breakfast crew were chatting to the hilarious Senor Sniff-Sniff this morning, when who should appear on the phone but Luis Garcia - coach of the Colombian national team! Luis was in a chatty mood and before long conversation turned, as it often does, to Faustino Asprilla's career plans. \"He is close to being transferred again to an English club,\" Luis said. \"I believe this team is very interested in him.\" As you can imagine, the phone lines went a bit crazy after that.</p> <p>Luis may not have actually spoken to Valderrama (his breakfast show finishes at 8am), but he's dead serious about former Newcastle star Tino. So the Fiver performed a quick survey of Premiership clubs to see if we could unearth the mystery buyer. The results were not overwhelmingly positive: five \"we don't know\"s, more than a few \"we don't comment on transfer speculation\"s, and one \"if there's anything to say we give a press release to the Press Association\" (thank you Chelsea's of Chelsea). At least Bradford told the Fiver they were \"damn certain it's not us\".</p> <p>In fact, if Tino is to go anywhere, a return to the North-east seems the most likely option. Newcastle wisely decided not to pick up the phone when we rang. Middlesbrough seemed a trifle uncertain, their spokesman suggesting, \"I've never heard Bryan Robson say he's a target.\" (But what about the secret targets he keeps to himself?) And then there's Newcastle's deadliest rivals Sunderland. \"We haven't been given any information on that,\" the Fiver was told. So you're not interested in taking him on then? \"That isn't what I said.\" Oh really.</p> <p>\u0093 Are you a Mackem? Has Tino been standing in front of you in the queue at Do It All? Has a mysterious person with a Spanish accent tried to buy your home? Let the Fiver know at <a href=\"the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a> and we'll share it with the world.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>IT STARTS ON THE FIFTH OF JUNE, SO SIGN UP - IT'S COMING SOON!</strong></p> <p>The Euro, the Fiver's beautiful bouncing Euro 2000 baby, wants you to give it a cuddle.

Freestyle!</p> <p>\"I had to sacrifice him because England is more important than Fulham,\" Mo says patriotically of Kelvin Koogan, as the sounds of God Save the Queen stir heroically in the background. \"If he was still here we would be in the Premiership, but it was my decision. It was possible I would not let him go, but you can't just have somebody. There is a matter of patriotism, England and glory.\" Mr Straw, are you listening?</p> <p>Mo also took time out from dealing with Libya's state-owned oil company and talking about his little pinkie (and we don't mean his finger) to outline his vision for Fulham's future. \"Harrods is the best department store in the world, it took me 15 years to bring it to its glory. The Paris Ritz is the number one hotel in the world. Fulham will also be the best, I hope. I am bringing back a great institution which has created so many heroes and I think we are there.\" </p> <p>Well not quite, Mr Al-Fayed. But even if Fulham don't make it all the way, Mo will continue his pitch for that British passport. \"The number one priority for me is British players. This is a British team and we must have British players first, that is very important.\" And there were we thinking he was Egyptian.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha\" - Viking Stavanger manager Benny Lennartsson when asked if he'd be interested in loaning Paul Gascoigne for the summer.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE FIVER'S WORST PLAYER OF THE SEASON 1999-2000</strong></p> <p>Who will take over John Hartson's fat mantle?

Unable to compete with other top London tourist attractions like Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the gentleman's toilets just behind Kings Cross, it's being forced to close. Apparently, the ridiculously-optimistic 750,000 idiot (sorry, visitor) target for the first year wasn't met, and some probably-not-very-surprised staff at the museum are being laid off as the Fiver writes.</p> <p>How could it all go so horribly, horribly wrong? How could a project which saw Jonathan Pearce and Gabby Yorath decide which footballers were worthy of the epithet \"famer\" go so awry? How could an establishment which tells you that Les Ferdinand \"has always scored goals\" fail to deliver? And why didn't more people flock to stare at a gormless wax Ian Rush?</p> <p>The Fiver doesn't know, and is sorry to see the Hall of Fame close. We didn't actually go to it, of course, although we were sent a promotional CD-ROM which didn't run but made a useful coaster. Desperate not to miss out, the Fiver rang Gary Trowsdale, director of football at the Hall of Fame, to put in an offer for the wax Sir Les. But apparently Fifa want all the models for their own \"internationally-themed football attraction\" and Les was \"absolutely not for sale\". Not even for the \u00a310 in ready cash we offered.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Leeds are closing in on \u00a37m Olivier Dacourt, with a deal for the midfielder set to be finalised within a couple of weeks. Busy Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said: \"Our interest in Olivier is well documented and we'll be doing everything we can to capture his signature. We will be announcing our new arrivals in the next week or two and they will all be major players.\"</p> <p>According to the Yorkshire Evening Post, Middlesbrough and Tottenham are fighting it out for the signature of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink after his Atletico Madrid side were relegated from the Primera Liga.</p> <p>Didier Deschamps has been linked with a move to French first-division side Lyon to become their player-coach.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux has admitted he would be \"very surprised\" if he was fit for Euro 2000.</p> <p>Manchester City will donate \u00a325,000 to charity instead of holding a parade to celebrate their return to the Premiership. The club has decided against an open top tour of the city because it was too difficult to organise and that the achievement was \"not of a scale to merit a parade.\" A spokesman for the club said the chosen charities would be named over the next few days.</p> <p>Harry Kewell must wait until June at the earliest to discover whether he will miss the start of Leeds' next European campaign. A Uefa U-turn means Kewell could face suspension after all following his sending-off for stamping during Leeds' Euro-Vase semi-final with Galatasaray at Elland Road. Meanwhile, Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale is hoping to \"tie up\" the appointment of Brian Kidd as the club's youth development supervisor by the end of the week.</p> <p>Derby manager Jim Smith has been charged with misconduct for comments made to referee Neale Barry during the Rams' draw with Tottenham last month. </p> <p>The Welsh squad to play Brazil at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, on May 23 and Portugal at Chaves, near Oporto on June 3 is: Crossley, Ward, Freestone, Delaney, Barnard, Giggs, Blake, Page, Coleman, Pembridge, Melville, Saunders, Speed, J Robinson, C Robinson, Bellamy, Jones, Symons, Savage, Hartson, I.Roberts, Johnson, G Roberts, Oster.

      "bodyText": "WHERE IN THE WORLD IS FAUSTINO ASPRILLA? Colombia's Radionet radio has never heard anything like it. Carlos Valderrama and his crazy, crazy breakfast crew were chatting to the hilarious Senor Sniff-Sniff this morning, when who should appear on the phone but Luis Garcia - coach of the Colombian national team! Luis was in a chatty mood and before long conversation turned, as it often does, to Faustino Asprilla's career plans. \"He is close to being transferred again to an English club,\" Luis said. \"I believe this team is very interested in him.\" As you can imagine, the phone lines went a bit crazy after that. Luis may not have actually spoken to Valderrama (his breakfast show finishes at 8am), but he's dead serious about former Newcastle star Tino. So the Fiver performed a quick survey of Premiership clubs to see if we could unearth the mystery buyer. The results were not overwhelmingly positive: five \"we don't know\"s, more than a few \"we don't comment on transfer speculation\"s, and one \"if there's anything to say we give a press release to the Press Association\" (thank you Chelsea's of Chelsea). At least Bradford told the Fiver they were \"damn certain it's not us\". In fact, if Tino is to go anywhere, a return to the North-east seems the most likely option. Newcastle wisely decided not to pick up the phone when we rang. Middlesbrough seemed a trifle uncertain, their spokesman suggesting, \"I've never heard Bryan Robson say he's a target.\" (But what about the secret targets he keeps to himself?) And then there's Newcastle's deadliest rivals Sunderland. \"We haven't been given any information on that,\" the Fiver was told. So you're not interested in taking him on then? \"That isn't what I said.\" Oh really. \u0093 Are you a Mackem? Has Tino been standing in front of you in the queue at Do It All? Has a mysterious person with a Spanish accent tried to buy your home? Let the Fiver know at the.boss@theguardian.com and we'll share it with the world. * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT STARTS ON THE FIFTH OF JUNE, SO SIGN UP - IT'S COMING SOON! The Euro, the Fiver's beautiful bouncing Euro 2000 baby, wants you to give it a cuddle. It's brought to you in association with breathe, and will arrive in your inbox each morning, keeping you up to date with everything that goes on in the lowlands this summer.

Freestyle! \"I had to sacrifice him because England is more important than Fulham,\" Mo says patriotically of Kelvin Koogan, as the sounds of God Save the Queen stir heroically in the background. \"If he was still here we would be in the Premiership, but it was my decision. It was possible I would not let him go, but you can't just have somebody. There is a matter of patriotism, England and glory.\" Mr Straw, are you listening? Mo also took time out from dealing with Libya's state-owned oil company and talking about his little pinkie (and we don't mean his finger) to outline his vision for Fulham's future. \"Harrods is the best department store in the world, it took me 15 years to bring it to its glory. The Paris Ritz is the number one hotel in the world. Fulham will also be the best, I hope. I am bringing back a great institution which has created so many heroes and I think we are there.\" Well not quite, Mr Al-Fayed. But even if Fulham don't make it all the way, Mo will continue his pitch for that British passport. \"The number one priority for me is British players. This is a British team and we must have British players first, that is very important.\" And there were we thinking he was Egyptian. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha\" - Viking Stavanger manager Benny Lennartsson when asked if he'd be interested in loaning Paul Gascoigne for the summer. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE FIVER'S WORST PLAYER OF THE SEASON 1999-2000 Who will take over John Hartson's fat mantle?

If you're bored, why not send in several to distort the result? * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT'S HALL OVER NOW It's the end of the road for the FA Premier League Hall of Fame. Unable to compete with other top London tourist attractions like Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the gentleman's toilets just behind Kings Cross, it's being forced to close. Apparently, the ridiculously-optimistic 750,000 idiot (sorry, visitor) target for the first year wasn't met, and some probably-not-very-surprised staff at the museum are being laid off as the Fiver writes. How could it all go so horribly, horribly wrong? How could a project which saw Jonathan Pearce and Gabby Yorath decide which footballers were worthy of the epithet \"famer\" go so awry? How could an establishment which tells you that Les Ferdinand \"has always scored goals\" fail to deliver? And why didn't more people flock to stare at a gormless wax Ian Rush? The Fiver doesn't know, and is sorry to see the Hall of Fame close. We didn't actually go to it, of course, although we were sent a promotional CD-ROM which didn't run but made a useful coaster. Desperate not to miss out, the Fiver rang Gary Trowsdale, director of football at the Hall of Fame, to put in an offer for the wax Sir Les. But apparently Fifa want all the models for their own \"internationally-themed football attraction\" and Les was \"absolutely not for sale\". Not even for the \u00a310 in ready cash we offered. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Leeds are closing in on \u00a37m Olivier Dacourt, with a deal for the midfielder set to be finalised within a couple of weeks. Busy Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said: \"Our interest in Olivier is well documented and we'll be doing everything we can to capture his signature. We will be announcing our new arrivals in the next week or two and they will all be major players.\" According to the Yorkshire Evening Post, Middlesbrough and Tottenham are fighting it out for the signature of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink after his Atletico Madrid side were relegated from the Primera Liga. Didier Deschamps has been linked with a move to French first-division side Lyon to become their player-coach. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux has admitted he would be \"very surprised\" if he was fit for Euro 2000. Manchester City will donate \u00a325,000 to charity instead of holding a parade to celebrate their return to the Premiership. The club has decided against an open top tour of the city because it was too difficult to organise and that the achievement was \"not of a scale to merit a parade.\" A spokesman for the club said the chosen charities would be named over the next few days. Harry Kewell must wait until June at the earliest to discover whether he will miss the start of Leeds' next European campaign. A Uefa U-turn means Kewell could face suspension after all following his sending-off for stamping during Leeds' Euro-Vase semi-final with Galatasaray at Elland Road. Meanwhile, Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale is hoping to \"tie up\" the appointment of Brian Kidd as the club's youth development supervisor by the end of the week. Derby manager Jim Smith has been charged with misconduct for comments made to referee Neale Barry during the Rams' draw with Tottenham last month. The Welsh squad to play Brazil at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, on May 23 and Portugal at Chaves, near Oporto on June 3 is: Crossley, Ward, Freestone, Delaney, Barnard, Giggs, Blake, Page, Coleman, Pembridge, Melville, Saunders, Speed, J Robinson, C Robinson, Bellamy, Jones, Symons, Savage, Hartson, I.Roberts, Johnson, G Roberts, Oster. Stand-by players: N Roberts, Jenkins, Haworth, Coates, Ready. Former Scotland international Steve Archibald heads one of three consortiums who have offered to save under-threat Airdrie. Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper has undergone surgery on a knee injury. Manchester United will play Manchester City on Wednesday August 16 in a testimonial for Denis Irwin. The nine yellow cards and three reds shown by Andy D'Urso in last night's 1-1 draw between Leeds and Everton at Elland Road set a new Premiership record. The tally beat the nine bookings and one dismissal dished out by Oxford referee Rob Harris in last October's game between Aston Villa and Liverpool at Villa Park. Rangers officials have arrived in Sydney to finalise the purchase of Australian club Northern Spirit. David Murray announced his hopes to take a controlling interest in the Australian side 11 days ago. Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis has been appointed to Fifa's marketing and television advisory board. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match (11.30pm) Bayern Munich v Real Madrid.

Anil Bhoyrul, one half of the sacked City Slickers team which tipped shares for the Mirror, claimed in a signed affidavit that Mr Morgan had been fully aware of the story that was to run in the newspaper. Mr Morgan has maintained since his share buying came to light that his purchase was coincidental to the tip. Mr Bhoyrul's statement, made to the Daily Express, comes as the the press complaints commission prepares to issue its verdict on the frenzy of claim and counter- claim behind the Mirror share-dealing episode. In his statement he claimed: \"Piers Morgan has lied throughout and I initially went along with it. The truth is that he purchased the stock with the knowledge that our story would raise the share price.\" The episode began when Mr Morgan admitted to buying \u00a320,000 worth of shares in Viglen Technology, run by Sir Alan Sugar, the day before the Slickers column ran a very positive article about the company. The editor was subsequently cleared in an inquiry held by the newspaper's parent group, Trinity Mirror, but has been the subject of further allegations about his stock portfolio. As a result of the revelations of its journalists' stock market dealings, Trinity Mirror issued new rules on share owning. The PCC will meet tomorrow to finalise its ruling as to whether Mr Morgan's actions were in breach of its code of conduct.

      "body": "<p>The first time I knew something was wrong was three years ago, when I almost got run over by a car. I was 15. I'd got off the bus from school. My mum was waiting for me down the lane and I walked across the road, straight in front of a car. It was like I wasn't there; I felt numb. The car screeched to a halt, and I carried on. It wasn't until my mum asked me what I was doing that I realised I could have died. </p> <p>When we got home, I remember crying and shaking and screaming uncontrollably because I didn't know what was happening to my body. I was exhausted, my stomach hurt, I had a terrible headache. Which just wasn't like me. Before, I'd been really active and outgoing. I'd been into long-distance running. I was the typical teenager - going out, babysitting, doing all the teenage things. </p> <p>Looking back, I'd say the illness had started a couple of weeks before that. I'd gone to hospital with bad tummy pains, which the doctors had initially thought was appendicitis. It wasn't, and I was discharged from hospital. To begin with, I seemed to get better; but when I went to school for the start of the summer term, I lasted about a week. </p> <p>My sleep was really badly affected. It got to the point where I wouldn't be able to sleep until about 4am, and then I'd be unable to get up the next day. The mornings were such a physical effort - even to get dressed and washed felt almost impossible. I'd be able to rest a bit on the bus to school, and at school I'd struggle on and try and do the work with my muscles hurting so badly. </p> <p>At the beginning, I managed to go into school a bit, but I was having to force myself. I'd put on a face and try to smile. My friends would be talking about boys and so on, but I couldn't care less what they were saying to me; I was in too much pain to be interested. I'd pretend, but I never let them know how I felt because I didn't want to upset them. I didn't want them to treat me as different. I worried that if I moaned too much about my illness, they wouldn't phone me. </p> <p>Before too long, I wasn't strong enough to go to school. The teachers were sympathetic and, because they knew what I'd been like before, didn't think I was putting it on. It was different with the school counsellor, though. She just made everything worse. She talked about my family. She asked if I was enjoying school. She was trying to dig into other reasons, and this really hurt. I knew that it wasn't anything to do with my childhood. They were suggesting things and I had to fight to keep hold of my own beliefs. But it was tempting to want to believe what they were saying, simply because I wanted to be better. </p> <p>Throughout this time I kept going to my GP. She took blood tests to see if I'd had glandular fever. She was sympathetic, and gave me painkillers, but these didn't do any good. At one point I was on six a day, and all they did was numb the pain a little. </p> <p>My family have been great, though. I remember when my dad realised for the first time that I was in a bad way. I'd been on at him for weeks to make me a picture frame and one day we finally went down to the wood yard to do it. We were getting the tools out and I just broke down. I felt exhausted. I couldn't cope with doing even this simple task. </p> <p>In December 1997, I was sent to a paediatrician. I described all my symptoms, and he said they didn't add up. The next day he called my mum at home. My dad and I were listening on the other phone and heard him say that there was nothing wrong with me - I should just get on with my life. Being treated this way left me with such a lot of anger, and I did a picture of how I felt. Since there seemed to be no way of describing to people how it felt to have rods of iron down my spine, I began drawing and painting how I felt instead. The pictures are not nice to look at - because the feelings weren't very nice either. Painting has really helped to let that anger out and show people a bit more what I feel. People can now look at them and see what I've been through. </p> <p>I'm now doing my art full-time. I started at Hereford college of art and design last September and, although I've only been in for a total of one and a half days, they've been supportive. There's a tutor who lives in Hay who drops in to check on my work. It's given me something to aim towards. Plus it's something that I love doing. The upcoming exhibition is my first. </p> <p>After the episode with the paediatrician, the school doctor came to see me at home. He was the first person who admitted that it might be ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome. That was a huge relief - I finally had a name for my illness. I knew that people might now believe me and not think that I was just making it up. </p> <p>Then we got in touch with the ME Association and my mum read all their books. I didn't. I worried that if I read the books then I'd be accused even more of making up my symptoms. But reading the material helped my mother. She was able to understand why this once smiley, laughing daughter wasn't getting up in the morning, and was spending all her time in a chair, unable to walk, in constant pain, with insufficient concentration even to read a book. </p> <p>It's only in the last year that it's started to get a bit better. I've been able to walk across a couple of fields without having awful after-effects. I'm still in pain, my muscles hurt pretty much constantly, my face feels like it's being eaten away by maggots. But it's made me a stronger person. I appreciate life more. My advice to anyone suffering from it would be: remember that you are going to get better; that it's the illness that's making you ill, not you. Rest as much as you can and don't overdo it because you'll pay for it in the end. Keep smiling and hope that you're going to get better. Who knows, one day there may be a magic pill.</p>",

Stoking a debate that has raged since the 70s, a small but growing band of dentists blame widespread mercury poisoning for a terrifying range of conditions, ranging from gum disease, migraine, headaches, depression, chronic fatigue, eczema and asthma to rheumatism, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, kidney disease and multiple sclerosis. Either they have exposed a cost-saving conspiracy between the dental establishment and the NHS that is costing people their good health and, in some cases, their lives - or they are lending credibility to a classic case of medical scaremongering that helps line the pockets of greedy dentists. </p> <p>Their argument is intuitively convincing. Mercury is the second most toxic metal on the planet after plutonium, and all dentists now agree that it is not, as previously believed, safely \"locked in\" when mixed with other metals in amalgam. Instead, it constantly releases toxic vapours, particularly during chewing, and has been banned for use in dentistry in Sweden. The Department of Health's committee on toxicity, while ruling the dangers unproved, warns that pregnant women should avoid the placement or removal of mercury fillings. Says Newbury: \"Everybody knows mercury is toxic, and if they brought it out now for use in fillings they'd be laughed out of the country.\" </p> <p>Jack Levenson, founder of the British Society for Mercury-Free Dentistry and author of a book on the subject, says any other problem on the same scale would have been labelled an epidemic long ago. \"The British Dental Association's figures say 3% of the population are particularly sensitive to mercury, and when you have an outbreak of flu, 0.4% counts as an epidemic,\" he argues. \"There is nothing in medicine that compares to the health benefits of having mercury fillings removed.\" </p> <p>In extreme cases, patients have spoken of serious symptoms vanishing within days of having their fillings removed. Levenson says the same thing happened to him when sweaty palms brought a halt to a potential professional career in tennis: having his fillings out appeared to eliminate the problem. </p> <p>One leading antiamalgamist, who prefers not to be named, smells a conspiracy. \"The new materials would increase the NHS dental bill sixfold. Then there's all the litigation from patients, and the pressure on health insurance companies. There's strong pressure to keep the lid on it.\" </p> <p>Mercury amalgam has been used by dentists for 150 years, though the effects of mercury poisoning were well-known before that: the use of mercury chloride in the preparation of felt hats - apart from providing the inspiration for a character from Alice in Wonderland - was blamed for the widespread incidence of St Vitus's Dance among hatmakers. For those campaigning to end its use, amalgam's long history explains why it was able to avoid the safety tests it would face if introduced today. \"We've been smoking for 300 years,\" says Anthony Newbury, by way of comparison, \"but only recently have we been told of the dangers, and cigarettes still haven't been banned.\" </p> <p>For more sceptical dentists, though, mercury's longevity makes exactly the opposite point. It has been used in billions of fillings - currently 15m a year - and the only evidence of harm is to be found in patients' anecdotal evidence or scientific studies whose methods have since been thrown into question. </p> <p>\"It's utter nonsense,\" says Professor Barry Eley of King's College, London. \"These fillings release small quantities of mercury, but well below the levels associated with toxicity. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that mercury released from amalgam is associated with the dan gers claimed.\" The health department's warning to pregnant women is, he reckons, a case of \"taking the maximum safety posture. Undoubtedly an awful lot of money is being made by dentists saying that you need all your mercury fillings replaced. Obviously, that can't be done on the health service, because there is no clinical justification.\" </p> <p>Other evidence makes the antiamalgamists' case look even less solid. Mercury was banned in Sweden - according to public pronouncements, at least - for environmental reasons; the BDA's former claim that 3% of the population are sensitive to mercury refers to reactions to all mercury in the environment and does not imply that 3% of people will necessarily react badly to amalgam fillings. Many of the tests for mercury levels used in studies, which frequently date back to the 70s, have since been accused of skewing results, while doubts have been raised over the \"electrodiagnostic\" tests used by some dentists today to measure levels of mercury in patients' mouths. Recent research by scientists at the University of Heidelberg found that many who complain of side-effects from mercury fillings may be unwittingly using them as a scapegoat for other disorders. </p> <p>The worst excesses of the anti- amalgam movement are exemplified by one Hal Huggins, an American dentist who published some of the earliest claims of the perils of amalgam. Huggins operated a lucrative consultation by mail and recommended a range of special dietary supplements - not unlike the charcoal tablets and vitamins recommended by antiamalgamists in Britain today - until his licence was revoked for malpractice in 1996. The presiding judge ruled that Huggins had diagnosed mercury toxicity in every patient who had visited him, including several who didn't even have mercury fillings. </p> <p> The number of complaints made against British dentists for unscrupulously recommending amalgam replacement is, sadly, unknown: complaints made to the General Dental Council are confidential until they reach the level of the council's professional conduct committee. A spokesman could not recall any ever having done so. \"The GDC are doing a very poor job of protecting the public on this matter,\" says one experienced dentist. \"They catch the very severe cheats, but they don't bother with the day-to-day things.\" </p> <p>Despite the entrenched nature of the debate, there is a surprising amount of agreement over whether you should automatically have all your mercury fillings replaced, and the answer is: don't. Antiamalgamists, though they would argue that unexplained health problems may well be due to mercury in your mouth, agree that removal of fillings exposes the body to an intense dose of toxins, even when properly carried out using specialised suction equipment and dental dams. Besides being more expensive, the composite material used instead has its own dangers too, since it releases peroxides and free radicals into the body. The decision remains a personal and financial one - but if your dentist doesn't at least inform of the existence of powerful evidence suggesting that the risk from mercury amalgam may be much smaller than some claim, find another dentist. </p> <p><strong>Sick to the back teeth</strong><br> Like most other paid-up members of the 21st century, I suffer from a variety of niggling, non-life-threatening health problems, which I have always ascribed to stress, pesticides, traffic fumes, sick building syndrome, hangovers or too much junk food. One thing I never gave a second thought to was my 12 amalgam fillings, which I started to accumulate as a chocolate-loving 10-year-old, writes Claire Wallerstein.</p> <p>An appointment with holistic dentist Dr Jack Levenson, however, has left me with the suspicion that there is a mini-toxic waste dump inside my head; that I, along with millions of others, could be suffering from long-term, low-level mercury poisoning. </p> <p>Dr Levenson, president of the British Society for Mercury-Free Dentistry, has removed the fillings of more than 6,000 patients over the past 20 years, and claims that nearly all found their health improved. \"I believe that many conditions fashionably attributed to viruses could in fact be caused by mercury toxicity,\" he says. </p> <p>On my visit to his surgery, my first task is to fill in a questionnaire. I tick away at symptom after symptom, but even I, a professional hypochondriac, can see that many are fairly minor - nightmares, shyness, bad breath, bedwetting, dandruff - and could have many potential causes. </p> <p>One point that interests Levenson is my allergy to costume jewellery - often made with other substances found in amalgam fillings, such as nickel. \"If you're allergic to it on your skin, what's it going to be like inside your head?\" he asks. </p> <p>This had never occurred to me before. Nor had I ever realised the numbness and tingling I often feel in my limbs could be a classic symptom of mercury poisoning. </p> <p>Next, Levenson measures the electric current in each of my fillings. The highest - in the one that makes me cringe most whenever I bite a Kit-Kat wrapper - reads 3.3 microamps. \"A few microamps may not sound a lot, but remember that the electrical current of the brain is measured in nanoamps - thousandths of a micro-amp,\" he says. \"The roof of the mouth is effectively the floor of the brain, and electrical interference may be implicated in problems such as migraine, epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease. In many patients there is a measurable change in brain waves after the removal of fillings.\" </p> <p>Next, I am hooked up to a \"vega meter\" which measures the energy flowing through an acupressure point on my thumb when I am exposed to different materials. My energy levels plunge in reaction to the amalgam, but not white plastic. </p> <p>By now I feel sure that having a head full of mercury probably isn't a good idea. But what horrifies me more is the cost - around \u00a31,500 - of having my fillings removed. The problem is that you can't just get the fillings ripped out, as mercury vapour is released when they are ground up for removal. </p> <p>Dr Levenson says extraction should be done in a well-ventilated surgery, and that the patient should have a rubber dam and extraction pump in their mouth to avoid inhalation of particles. They should also wear clothes covering as much of the skin as possible, and breathe air from a nasal tube. </p> <p>During the operation, Levenson sometimes uses intravenous vitamin C as a detoxifying agent. He also prescribes a whole range of vitamins, homeopathic remedies, massages and saunas afterwards to help remove the reservoir of mercury that has built up in the body over the years. </p> <p>So what can be done for people like me with a mouth lined with mercury, but not enough money to have it removed? Apparently the best thing is to limit your exposure by avoiding unnecessary chewing (which increases the production of mercury vapour), which means cutting out snacks between meals, and avoiding salty, sour and hot foods. Refined carbohydrates and sugars are also a no-no, as they help oral bacteria to produce lactic acid, which corrodes fillings. </p> <p>It's also sensible to cut down on mercury intake from other sources, such as contact lens solutions, and to try to avoid your fillings when brushing your teeth. Supplements of vitamin C, sulphur, selenium, seaweed and charcoal may help to remove mercury from the body.</p> <p>\u0095 The Brompton Dental Surgery, 221 Old Brompton Rd, London W1.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Alternative to HRT</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I am only 42 but my doctor has told me I am entering the menopause. She has provided me with lots of information about the pros and cons of HRT. It seems to have risks and benefits. What do you think about it? Are there any natural alternatives? </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> Firstly, 42 is young to be menopausal - the average age in the UK is 50. A blood test for the hormone FSH can confirm if you're in any doubt. HRT is great for hot flushes, sweats, vaginal dryness and is the best way of preventing bone thinning (osteoporosis). You can't take HRT if you've had a thrombosis and taking HRT slightly increases your risk of getting a thrombosis from one woman in 10,000 per year to three women in 10,000 per year. Among 50-year-old non-HRT users, 45 women in every 1,000 will get breast cancer by the time they get to 70 years old. If you use HRT for over five years, there will be an extra two cases of breast cancer in every 1,000 women. You can boost your oestrogen levels by eating phytoestrogens-plant derived oestrogens in soy and linseed. 1,000mgs per day of calcium, not smoking and regular exercise help keep bones strong and a bone density scan every year can check for osteoporosis. Natural progesterone skin cream (eg Progest) remains unproven but some women swear by it. </p> <p><strong> Sore mouth</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I am 72 years old and am plagued by splits at the sides of my mouth which become so sore that I have to take my dentures out. It is stoppping me from enjoying my food. Any advice? </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> This problem, known as angular cheilitis, is likely to be caused by your dentures. If you don't regularly wear both top and bottom sets, your upper lip may be over-riding your lower lip, causing deep grooves at the angles of the mouth. Saliva and sweat collect in the grooves causing infection. You may want to get your dentures checked, wear both sets all the time, and scrub them daily with soap and water. Vaseline and Canesten cream help. </p> <p><strong> Phlegmy throat</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I have recently been to see my doctor over a throat problem that just won't go away. It feels like I have a lot of mucus I am constantly swallowing. It is making me feel very sick. My doctor gave me some mouthwash but this is not working. I am at a stage in life that is very tiring as I have an eight-year-old Down's syndrome child with insulin-dependant diabetes and this feeling is making me feel like I can't cope. </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> You might be suffering from acid reflux. With all the worries you must have about your child, it wouldn't be suprising if your stomach is producing excess acid. If a good swig of an antacid such as gaviscon (10mls, three times day) gets rid of the sensation, you have your answer. If not, you may want to ask your GP to refer you to a gastroenterologist. If the Gaviscon works, you can try to prevent a recurrence by cutting out acid, spicy foods and alcohol, eating small, frequent meals, losing excess weight and sleeping with an extra pillow. Managing your stress levels must be a challenge and I wonder whether you are able to put some time aside for yourself to help you cope. </p> <p><strong> Pregnancy pain</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I'm six months pregnant and am in more pain than I could ever imagine. I get a shooting pain through the pubic bone, round my whole pelvis, in my inner thighs and an ache in my lower back. My GP and midwife have suggested paracetamol and hot baths. Can you help? </p> <p><strong> A </strong> Your condition has a name - diastasis symphysis pubis (DSP). There is no known cure, though it does improve once you've had the baby. It's common and frightening. A lady called Angie Lambert had such a bad time with this condition in her pregnancies that she helped set up a self-help group with an expert advisory team. Contact the British Symphysis Pubic Dysfunction (SPD) Support Group (01843 587 356 or at http://dsp.future.easyspace.com) </p> <p><strong> Wet nights</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> My eight year old son still wets the bed. He's got a school trip next year and we really want to crack the problem. What do you suggest? </p> <p><strong> A: </strong> A star chart can work wonders. Award a star for a dry night, and a special star for a full week. If that doesn't work, ask your GP for referral to a clinic that can provide you with a bed-wetting alarm. It goes off when in contact with liquid. This wakes your child who then needs to change the sheets. There's useful advice from Eric (Enuresis Resource and Information Centre) on 0117 960 3060. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

I get a shooting pain through the pubic bone, round my whole pelvis, in my inner thighs and an ache in my lower back. My GP and midwife have suggested paracetamol and hot baths. Can you help? A Your condition has a name - diastasis symphysis pubis (DSP). There is no known cure, though it does improve once you've had the baby. It's common and frightening. A lady called Angie Lambert had such a bad time with this condition in her pregnancies that she helped set up a self-help group with an expert advisory team. Contact the British Symphysis Pubic Dysfunction (SPD) Support Group (01843 587 356 or at http://dsp.future.easyspace.com) Wet nights Q: My eight year old son still wets the bed. He's got a school trip next year and we really want to crack the problem. What do you suggest? A: A star chart can work wonders. Award a star for a dry night, and a special star for a full week. If that doesn't work, ask your GP for referral to a clinic that can provide you with a bed-wetting alarm. It goes off when in contact with liquid. This wakes your child who then needs to change the sheets. There's useful advice from Eric (Enuresis Resource and Information Centre) on 0117 960 3060. \u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email drann@dircon.co.uk or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

      "bodyText": "Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers yesterday became the first minister to break New Labour's political quarantine around Ken Livingstone when he met the newly-elected mayor to discuss the closure threat hanging over Ford's Dagenham car factory. The two men agreed to work together to intensify pressure on the US-owned multinational to maintain manufacturing production at the Essex site - Ford is expected to announce the closure of the Fiesta assembly plant on Friday - and maximise investment in the area to offset the expected loss of more than 2,000 jobs. Mr Livingstone, who was sworn in as mayor at the temporary Greater London assembly headquarters at Westminster yesterday, is also seeking an emergency meeting with senior Ford managers. He will argue that Ford's reputation in Britain as a good \"corporate citizen\" will be seriously damaged if it goes ahead with plans to phase out car production in a country which now accounts for 28% of its European market. Mr Livingstone has already met union and business leaders to discuss what can be done to save the plant, though responsibility for economic regeneration will remain with the trade and industry department until July. Both Mr Byers and Mr Livingstone described their meeting as constructive. The mayor also held talks yesterday with London assembly members he was hoping to draw into his coalition administration, amid signs of disagreement in the GLA Labour group and between Downing Street and Labour's Millbank headquarters about how far to co-operate. The discussions were described by one member of Mr Livingstone's team as \"extremely sensitive\" and last night only one assembly member had accepted a job in his cabinet: Darren Johnson, the Green party's former mayoral candidate, who has taken the environment portfolio. Mr Johnson immediately threw the mayoral administration's weight behind the campaign to stop the building of a controversial leisure complex in Crystal Palace park, south London. But Liberal Democrat Lord Tope yesterday turned down an offer to become chairman of the fire and emergency planning authority, saying the job did not \"accord with our priorities\", which were equalities and social justice. Labour GLA member Lord Harris, who Mr Livingstone wanted to chair the new Metropolitan police committee, complained that he first heard about the proposal through the media, and Tory Bob Neill said the offer of a \"non-portfolio role\" smacked of tokenism. The Labour group was meeting last night to consider how far to co-operate with Mr Livingstone, who has offered the post of deputy to Labour's Nicky Gavron.",

Walking though it some weeks ago, I wondered how artists invited to show in this 155 metre long, 35 metre high space could survive the attempt. Lars Nittve, Tate Modern's director, has talked of it as \"the street\". But streets have convivial corners, breaks, a sense of human scale. I feel like an ant in here, and the bridge that cuts across the space about halfway along is a hard climb to reach. Once up there, I feel horribly aware of emptiness above and below. A giant, pregnant spider's up here with me. And it's worse down at ground level again, because then there is the prospect of climbing all three of Louise Bourgeois's rickety-looking towers, where, once aloft, one is truly suspended in the void. </p> <p>Bourgeois herself, at 89, has never seen her towers except as maquettes. She once did a series of prints called He Disappeared into Complete Silence, which is exactly how you feel as you climb the wavering, rusted spiral stairs. The towers, called I Do, I Undo and I Redo, did and undid me. They nearly did for me, but it is worth it. Atop two of the towers are what look like arrangements of giant dental mirrors, and sturdy old wooden chairs. Sit down, and you find yourself distortedly reflected from every angle, your image looming over the void. </p> <p>The towers, as all towers should, contain secrets. Carved marble hands sparkling out of the chipped stone. Forearms with a hand at either end - babies' and mothers' hands, palm up, palm down. There are other things to find as you climb through the dark, clanking interiors. A mother and child under a bell jar, like junk-shop voodoo, the baby floating on the umbilical cord that snakes from navel to navel. Other mothers and babies in bell jars, one in each tower, good mothers and bad mothers and mothers who aren't quite good enough. The bad mother spurts her milk on the ground. A fat, homely mother sewn from old pink corduroy nursing her fat pink babe. There's more, including big bubbles of red glass floating up through one tower's red-lit interior, which one views through a magnifying mirror, while sitting inside the tower's base. I realise that the chairs Bourgeois has provided make you sit like a child, a diminished, watched being with your knees together in a world that's too big. </p> <p>The Turbine Hall is going to be daunting for any artist invited to work there. The choices, as far as I can see, are either to work, as it were, at street level, or to engage architecturally, as Bourgeois has. The success of her project is partly due to the way she has worked with the very big (the towers, the spider) and the very small (the mantlepiece curio in the bell jar, the life-size hand). And once inside the towers, of course, you are shut off, and could be anywhere. </p> <p>Louise Bourgeois is extremely old, and excessively, calculatedly, at odds with the everyday world about her. This would be terrible, if it weren't also her strength. This isn't her greatest work, even if it is her largest, although it is incredibly successful in this most difficult of spaces, a space that could make an artist disappear into complete, irrevocable silence. Which, I guess, is also what much of the Tate's audience might feel on their first visit here.</p>",

There are other things to find as you climb through the dark, clanking interiors. A mother and child under a bell jar, like junk-shop voodoo, the baby floating on the umbilical cord that snakes from navel to navel. Other mothers and babies in bell jars, one in each tower, good mothers and bad mothers and mothers who aren't quite good enough. The bad mother spurts her milk on the ground. A fat, homely mother sewn from old pink corduroy nursing her fat pink babe. There's more, including big bubbles of red glass floating up through one tower's red-lit interior, which one views through a magnifying mirror, while sitting inside the tower's base. I realise that the chairs Bourgeois has provided make you sit like a child, a diminished, watched being with your knees together in a world that's too big. The Turbine Hall is going to be daunting for any artist invited to work there. The choices, as far as I can see, are either to work, as it were, at street level, or to engage architecturally, as Bourgeois has. The success of her project is partly due to the way she has worked with the very big (the towers, the spider) and the very small (the mantlepiece curio in the bell jar, the life-size hand). And once inside the towers, of course, you are shut off, and could be anywhere. Louise Bourgeois is extremely old, and excessively, calculatedly, at odds with the everyday world about her. This would be terrible, if it weren't also her strength. This isn't her greatest work, even if it is her largest, although it is incredibly successful in this most difficult of spaces, a space that could make an artist disappear into complete, irrevocable silence. Which, I guess, is also what much of the Tate's audience might feel on their first visit here.",

This exhibition includes 22 artists, each of whom has been given a gallery, and highlights a major strength of Tate Modern: one is, by and large, able to see individual or small groups of works in almost ideal conditions. The exhibition has an air of clarity and distinction - where, that is, the artists are capable of it. Many repay close individual attention, and I'll be returning to them. </p> <p>There is no catalogue to this paying exhibition, which comprises both Tate-owned works and temporary loans. It would be easy, too, to see this floor as an extension of the suites above and below, so porous are the themes of the collection's display. In fact, certain works here fulfil the rubrics exactly. Ilya Kabakov's installation, Labyrinth: My Mother's Album, for example, might even be called History/Memory/Society, as he takes us down the narrow, gloomy corridors of a Moscow apartment. We brush the walls as we turn and turn again, ever inwards towards a distant room, where a man is singing to himself. The walls are decorated with the typed and handwritten memories of a fictitious tenant, who has lived through the deprivations of Russian life, while other texts promise the burgeoning utopia of the Soviet system. The corridor takes us to a vacant, abandoned room, a core of melancholy, futility and wasted human potential. </p> <p>This melancholy, this weighty sense of yearning is continued in Rachel Whiteread's Ghost, her cast of a Victorian living room, and in Miroslaw Balka's Dawn, an installation of human-sized cylinders and small objects related to the body. It is a kind of symbolic, theatrical space for unknown actions, bounded by a horizon line of metal pipe, as though we were inside the diagram for a ritual. </p> <p>The artists in Between Cinema and a Hard Place, we are told in a short introduction by Tate Modern curator Frances Morris, \"have sought to include, as part of the work, the actual space in which it is installed\". This means that we are included too, inside the metaphorical as well as physical space of the work. The cinema of the title can stand for the use of imagery and allusion in the work, even when there isn't a projector in sight. The \"hard place\", Morris writes, brings us back to the material world itself, either in the artists' deployment of actual materials, or in the world as it appears in cinema or video. A nice analogy, even though it is a sort of sleight of hand, and could apply to almost anything. </p> <p>We cannot avoid narrating our way through exhibitions, even when the stories the artists themselves tell - like Matthew Barney's - are so opaque as to be entirely inscrutable to anyone else. In this context, the group of figures on tiered benches, by Juan Munoz, who laugh at whatever it is that they can see in the blank, empty space between themselves and the wall, invites us to speculate on what is withheld, and what we ourselves bring to the work. </p> <p>Between Cinema and a Hard Place also includes Bill Viola's Nantes Triptych, a video installation depicting real birth, real death and a man plunging and resurfacing in water, as well as video works by Gary Hill, Douglas Gordon and Stan Douglas, and annoying rooms by Rebecca Horn and Mona Hatoum - both of whom are being over-promoted by the Tate. There is a room full of Horn's performance accoutrements upstairs and Hatoum, as well as showing in the permanent collection, also has a current exhibition over at Tate Britain. But this exhibition tells us that we no longer need to travel abroad all the time to catch up on many of these artists, and that their work isn't necessarily compromised in group shows.</p>",

The United manager apparently watched Panucci in Internazionale's 4-0 home defeat by Fiorentina at the weekend and will spend \u00a36m on the adaptable defender.</p> <p>One player United won't be signing is Fiorentina goalkeeper <strong>Francesco Toldo</strong>. The Italian international has patched up the differences with his club Fiorentina. \"I have spoken with President Cecchi Gori and together we've decided that I'm staying at Fiorentina,\" Toldo revealed. He is now expected to sign a new five year deal with the club.</p> <p>England under-21 goalkeeper <strong>Richard Wright</strong> will leave <strong>Ipswich Town</strong> this summer if they are not promoted. The Sun report him as saying: \"I will sit down with the club after the play-offs and discuss my future. I want Premiership football.\"</p> <p><strong>Newcastle</strong> are the latest club to develop an interest in \u00a36m <strong>Trevor Sinclair</strong>.

The 21-year-old Icelandic striker has been a long time target for <strong>Newcastle</strong> and <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> amongst others, and Bolton are resigned to losing him if they fail to gain Premiership status this summer.</p> <p><strong>Middlesbrough</strong> are set to make a \u00a33m move for <strong>Chris Morgan</strong> according to the Daily Mail. The 22-year-old defender is the Tyke's player of the year.</p> <p>Brentford midfielder <strong>Martin Rowlands</strong> is wanted by both <strong>Coventry</strong> and <strong>Charlton</strong>. Teamtalk suggest that the 21-year-old is likely to move for \u00a33m this summer.</p> <p>The Mirror reports that <strong>Leeds</strong> look like completing the \u00a37m signing of former Everton midfielder <strong>Olivier Dacourt</strong> from Lens.</p> <p>An unnamed English club is on the verge of signing <strong>Faustino Asprilla</strong>.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United want Parma's Lilian Thuram. The Mirror reports that Old Trafford insiders have abandoned their attempts to sign Sol Campbell because the England man looks set to stay at Spurs. The versatile Thuram meanwhile could leave Parma this summer and United are expected to make a bid of \u00a311m for his services. The Daily Mail meanwhile suggests that Sir Alex Ferguson's eye is on another Serie A star, Italian international Christian Panucci. The United manager apparently watched Panucci in Internazionale's 4-0 home defeat by Fiorentina at the weekend and will spend \u00a36m on the adaptable defender. One player United won't be signing is Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo. The Italian international has patched up the differences with his club Fiorentina. \"I have spoken with President Cecchi Gori and together we've decided that I'm staying at Fiorentina,\" Toldo revealed. He is now expected to sign a new five year deal with the club. England under-21 goalkeeper Richard Wright will leave Ipswich Town this summer if they are not promoted. The Sun report him as saying: \"I will sit down with the club after the play-offs and discuss my future. I want Premiership football.\" Newcastle are the latest club to develop an interest in \u00a36m Trevor Sinclair. The Sun claims that the Hammers midfielder is admired by Bobby Robson, and that Harry Redknapp may have to sell the England international if he wants to complete Frederic Kanoute's move to Upton Park. The Express believes that Chelsea are leading the race to sign \u00a35m Eidur Gudjohnsen from Bolton. The 21-year-old Icelandic striker has been a long time target for Newcastle and Middlesbrough amongst others, and Bolton are resigned to losing him if they fail to gain Premiership status this summer. Middlesbrough are set to make a \u00a33m move for Chris Morgan according to the Daily Mail. The 22-year-old defender is the Tyke's player of the year. Brentford midfielder Martin Rowlands is wanted by both Coventry and Charlton. Teamtalk suggest that the 21-year-old is likely to move for \u00a33m this summer. The Mirror reports that Leeds look like completing the \u00a37m signing of former Everton midfielder Olivier Dacourt from Lens. An unnamed English club is on the verge of signing Faustino Asprilla. Asprilla, currently playing for Palmeiras in Brazil, \"is close to being transferred again to an English club\", according to Colombian national coach Luis Garcia. \"This team is very interested in him.\"",

On polling day itself, knowing the importance of throwing the first punch, Blair already seemed to be making an extra effort, looking sleeker than usual in a dark blue single-breasted suit, and a pale biscuity tie with a light-blue shirt. (You don't have to be a colour expert to see that blue suits Blair better than red or even white. This is something the spinners will have to work on.) </p> <p>Blair has always been a hard man to pin down, sartorially speaking. Not for him a hallmark, \u00e0 la Michael Foot's duffel coat: eschewing look-at-me antics such as Ken's famous-scruffy-bloke overcoats and Margaret Thatcher's bossy handbags, he has taken the low road. His most noticeable feature, fashion-wise, has been his enthusiasm for the dress-down trend, generally expressed through the wearing of short-sleeved shirts. </p> <p>This is significant, as attitudes to short-sleeved shirts are a litmus test of a man's ability to move with the times. Style experts over a certain age can be relied upon to get terrifically worked up about the wearing of short-sleeved shirts for activities other than gardening, declaring it vulgarity on a par with shell suits - thus, embracing short-sleeved shirts is Modern. But lest this be deemed rash, Blair compensates when dressing formally in a suit and proper shirt by always wearing double cuffs and cufflinks: a clever touch which is not only a nod to traditionalism but also says: \"Leave it to me. I am so in control that I can even find my cufflinks before rushing off to attend to an international crisis.\" </p> <p>It is the casual look that has sometimes backfired on Blair. The tomato-red polo shirt he sported at a Kosovan refugee camp in Albania in May last year showed clearly why the PM rarely wears red - it makes him look aggressive, the sort of man who might brazenly nab the last hedge-strimmer from under your nose in Homebase on a Saturday morning. </p> <p>On European visits, he has shown a penchant for safe but stylish beige summer suits, but has slipped up badly in teaming a slightly-too-fitted shirt and chinos with sport sandals. But Blair is hardly alone in a certain clumsiness when it comes to mixing smart and casual garments. All over the country, you see outfits which look like the result of complex negotiations in front of the wardrobe: jeans and a T-shirt looks too scruffy so you try shirt and trousers but that looks too smart, so you end up wearing jeans with a shirt tucked in and belted. This often simply doesn't work, but men seem less able than women to grasp the idea that clothes have to work as outfits, that the favourite shoes don't necessarily go with the favourite jeans. </p> <p>Blair's best look, as sported yesterday, owes as much to the US and its eastern seaboard Wasp resorts as to his favourite European holiday destinations - the hanging-loose-in-top-quality-linen look is extremely Hamptons-esque, and best accessorised with a boat and a large friendly dog. But, of course, it also works in Tuscany, and Islington, and Downing Street. And that is why it works on Blair: he looks at home in it. </p> <p>Whether the Shirt is the beginning of a new sartorial era for Blair, it is too early to say. But with the ultimate fashion accessory on the way, in the form of a fourth child - Nicholas Coleridge of Cond\u00e9 Nast, the magazine publisher, declared last year that, among the smart set, four was the only number of children to have - Blair could soon be home and dry.

Today, the Revolutionary United Front is a force of between 5,000 and 10,000, infamous for its terror tactics, which is now threatening the capital, Freetown. The RUF, one of several rebel groups, said it was fighting to destroy a corrupt system under which the government and foreigners monopolised the diamond trade. The group created panic in Freetown early in its campaign by using mutilation; its trademark is the double mutilation - hacking off both hands. The RUF is led by Foday Sankoh, a former professional photographer who never rose above the rank of corporal when serving in the military. A western diplomat said yesterday: \"Lots of people have questioned [Sankoh's] sanity. Some ask if he is in touch with his people in the field; others if he is in touch with reality.\" \"He's crazy,\" Alimamy Koroma, the general secretary of the Council of Churches in Sierra Leone, said in an interview last year. \"It hurts all of us that someone of the low calibre of a Foday Sankoh could destabilise the entire Sierra Leone.\" The Foreign Office questioned yesterday how much control Mr Sankoh had over his own commanders in the field: he claimed he had told his commanders to release the hostages.

      "bodyText": "The escalating crisis in Sierra Leone seemed a classic case for intervention by British mobile rapid reaction forces. At first sight, it appeared to give practical weight to the government's commitment to the UN last year to earmark troops for flashpoints across the world - and even to Tony Blair's call for a new \"doctrine of international community\". Overnight, a battalion of paratroopers - 700 in all - had landed at Lungi airport, close to the capital, Freetown. Four RAF Chinook helicopters were preparing to airlift evacuees from outlying regions. A Royal Navy taskforce consisting of the new helicopter carrier, HMS Ocean, HMS Chatham, a Type 23 destroyer, two landing ships and a supply ship, HMS Fort Austin, was preparing to sail for the west African country. HMS Ocean was already in the Mediterranean, as were 600 marines from 42 Commando, who were carrying out exercises in southern France. The aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious was diverted from Nato exercises off Portugal. Questioned about the strength of the fighting force sent to Sierra Leone, defence sources said last night: \"It is inadvisable to have only one card to play.\" Offshore-based helicopters would provide an alternative escape route if Lungi were attacked by rebels. Despite the scale of the mission, ministers insisted yesterday that the role of British troops was strictly limited to evacuating civilians. They insisted that they will not be part of any \"blue beret\" force, although officials were careful not to rule out the possibility that they might help to keep Lungi airport safe for UN reinforcements. The show of British force highlighted the UN's continuing failure to mount an effective multinational peacekeeping operation. The problem, mentioned yesterday by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, was identified by him a year ago when he said: \"One of the problems with peacekeeping has been the speed of deployment. With each delay the problems get worse.\" Yesterday independent analysts said they had already got worse. \"There is an obvious need for a UN rapid reaction capability, a golden opportunity has gone begging,\" one said yesterday. Nigel Vinson of the Royal United Services Institute said it would be a tall order for British troops to help evacuate UN forces from Sierra Leone in addition to civilians as the taskforce did not have the firepower or tactical mobility to get involved in fighting the rebel Revolutionary United Front. Tim Spicer, director of Sand-line, the private military company at the centre of the arms-to-Africa affair two years ago, told the Guardian that the problem with the UN was that it had no standing military structure and its peacekeeping forces had no common training standards, equipment or communications systems. He said the UN could sponsor private military firms that could put the RUF \"right back into its box\". Mr Spicer also criticised the international community for allowing the RUF to join the Sierra Leone government and keep its weapons after the Lome peace accord. Defence sources pointed out yesterday that the UN's mandate was merely to \"stabilise\" the situation. They admitted that the Lome peace accord had left a power vacuum in Sierra Leone. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said the reason so many British troops had been deployed was to ensure that they could operate effectively in such a chaotic situation. \"It is obviously important in such a confused and volatile situation that our own forces don't come under threat.\" The British action in Sierra Leone is impressive.

      "body": "<p>The Guardian has long been more committed than any other national newspaper, not only to covering education, but to providing practical support to teachers, parents and students. </p> <p>Last week that commitment entered a new phase: the educational values which are already deeply embedded in the newspaper are being massively expanded online. </p> <p>We launched, last Wednesday, a new website called learn.co.uk. It aims to provide the most comprehensive, high-quality learning content anywhere on the web. Having looked at the future of the internet, it's clear to us (as it's no doubt clear to most parents and teachers, let alone their children) that one of the fields in which the web is most quickly going to transform our lives is education. </p> <p>The net provides the opportunity to offer highly interactive learning materials to anyone who wants to access them, whenever they like. It could be in a classroom, it might be at home - it doesn't matter. The same materials will be open to all. And all our core content will be provided free. </p> <p>Parents who use computers at home with their children (often in the form of \"edutainment\") know that interactivity can turn dry textbook learning into fun. Material that a child might yawn over on a page becomes a lively experience on screen. </p> <p>On our site you can turn to a biology lesson, click on a diagram, and watch a plant being fertilised. In physics, you can call up a diagram of a planet going around a sun and, by altering its density, see how you can change the planet's orbit by changing gravitational pull. Or, instead of messing with a circuit board, you can connect to a lesson on Ohm's Law and alter resistances on the page, immediately seeing the effect of your actions. </p> <p>And when a lesson is read, or an online experiment completed, you can ask the site to set a test to find out if you've taken in what you need to know. Unlike most other sites, though, you won't get the same test every time you come back: questions will be randomly generated, so the test will be subtly different every time. Within lessons, you will be asked to answer quite sophisticated questions. In English, for example, questions are not just multiple choice - sometimes a range of answers can be correct, and the site makes it clear what your options are. </p> <p>For now, with exams just around the corner, the site has launched with the big four subjects at GCSE: English literature, English language, mathematics and double science. French (the next most popular GCSE subject after the \"big four\") will be uploaded to the site soon. We want to help students revise for those exams - but not in the conventional online way of simply offering up titbit Q and A exchanges. On learn.co.uk, students can recap whole topics online. </p> <p>At this stage, each subject is covered for higher-tier candidates - for next year's exams we will cover every level, foundation, intermediate and higher, and start differentiating within lessons for a variety of ability levels. </p> <p>Ultimately, we will cover every dot and comma of the national curriculum, from the age of five to 16, and all the main subjects at A level, too. We will upload more and more new subjects on to the site over the coming months. But again, unlike most other sites, we will never put up a subject until our coverage is comprehensive and complete. Everything in the curriculum for that subject, for that age group, will be on learn.co.uk. When you come to the site and see that we have, say, science for key stage 2, you will be able to find every component of the national curriculum covered for that age group. </p> <p>The other basis for parents and teachers to feel confident about the site's educational content is that everything has been evaluated by classroom teachers at state comprehensive schools. In fact, we are looking for more partner schools to take part in that process, and are keen to hear from headteachers who want to play a part in developing what we believe will rapidly become one of the most powerful learning resources anywhere in the world. </p> <p>In September, we will add the core subjects at key stages 2 and 3 and expand our coverage at key stage 4. Between now and then we will also be adding resources for teachers from the Guardian's vast archive, including all those up-to-date language materials and current affairs graphics that appear each week in this section. </p> <p>For teachers we will be adding a job search section soon. For parents, there will be features offering information and advice on schools, as well as how to help your child learn on the web. For students we will be providing everything from online learning support to talk boards. </p> <p>In researching what teachers, parents and students want from the web, we have discovered that they are most baffled by how and where to find the information they need. It seems like there's so much information out there, but it's a nightmare to find it. You can go to search engines, or you can take a tip from a friend - but then you find yourself spending what seems like hours trawling through page after web page, not quite arriving at the item you need. </p> <p>One of the advantages we have as a newspaper is that we can build a relationship between printed words and pictures, and active online learning. In this recently redesigned section, we now have an area called Learning, with a regular web guide. Our web guides, in the paper and online, will make it vastly easier to find online learning resources. And each time we add a new feature or a new subject to the site, we will be able to keep you informed through the pages of this section. </p> <p>The sample pages and images on these pages give you an idea what the site looks and feels like; they give you some impression of the seriousness and depth, but also the attractiveness of the material on offer. But the only way you can really judge is to go online and take a look for yourself. When you have, tell us what you think - either by emailing learn.co.uk, or by writing to the Education section. On the constantly evolving web, you might find your suggestion can be acted on more quickly than you believed possible.</p>",

      "body": "<p>How should a woman live her life? Survive to the age of 70, fearfully, being as everyone else instructs her to be? Or play the heroine, passionately, in the knowledge that trying and failing need not equal defeat? </p> <p>This is the timeless conundrum Tolstoy's vivid heroine, Anna Karenina, took on, long before it became fashionable to discuss the conflict of desire and expectation in women's lives. She was an original of her era, but what are the resonances of Anna's story for the modern woman? </p> <p>Born into the wealthy, decadent upper class of 19th-century St Petersburg, Anna confronts the hypocrisy of the day when she breaks free of an empty marriage after falling in love with army officer Vronsky. She scandalises her contemporaries when she chooses to live with him as his mistress, after her husband refuses her a divorce. But her passion for her lover is tempered by the pain of leaving her son and the disapproval heaped on her by the Russian aristocracy. Spiralling into depression and opium addiction, she starts to doubt Vronsky. A bout of morbid jealousy tips her over the edge and she throws herself under a train. </p> <p>When viewers first see Anna, they are aware of the elements of her existence - she is a society hostess, an obedient wife, a good mother - but they don't know who she is. Nor does anyone in the story because they don't bother to ask. But loneliness isn't dependent on the century: there are many women today who feel isolated. They don't feel they express themselves in the way they want to, they don't look the way they want to, they are not doing the job they should be doing. Anna is a woman who feels all those things and decides her passion to be loved is greater than her fear of being alone and afraid all her life. </p> <p>Of course there is a great romanticism to her plight, but she is no feckless ingenue. She leaves her husband and son because it is her only chance of survival. For the first time in her life, Anna is pursued by a man who tells her that she is lovable, that she is beautiful, intelligent and sexual. Everyone understands that need to be loved. Tolstoy wrote that throughout life we experience such revelations and the skill of being alive is to acknowledge them and allow them to change you. Anna can never go back. </p> <p>In the society in which she lived, it was the norm to be inspired by something higher than yourself: for a man to die for his tsar, his country or his God was considered noble. Women could live out their passions only within the constraints of the home, as Anna did during her nine-year marriage. But when she met Vronsky, her tremendous capacity to love was ignited. It is this passion that both excited Tolstoy and makes her such a compelling heroine. Her ability to live in the moment and her great honesty make her hugely satisfying to play. When she follows her heart, she feels those passions we all want to feel. </p> <p>Today, passion is narrowly defined in a sexual way. And this in turn is externalised into the formulaic, cold, aesthetic beauty that is admired in our sex. Style has become a dress size, not an attitude, and passion is about a pair of kitten-heeled mules. </p> <p> This is underlined by reactions to my being cast as Anna. Many people have compared me unfavourably with Greta Garbo, who played the part in 1935. But why shouldn't an actress be cast because of her passion for the role rather than because of her looks? When Tolstoy wrote the novel, he didn't describe Anna as beautiful - he gave her a low forehead and large features - but no reviewer then complained that he had failed to make her a goddess. </p> <p>Anna's appeal lies in the visceral rather than the physical. It is worth remembering that in Tolstoy's Russia, the idea of beauty was far more personal, more localised. There was no media aesthetic and no sense of what people in other countries looked like. Today, women are constantly made aware of the physical impression they create; sexuality is defined by the male view of it and women's sexual role is seen as passive and usable. The images of women's bodies that appear in advertising and in the media signal vulnerability, needing to be saved and being sexually available at all times. At least Anna and her contemporaries escaped this. </p> <p>Indeed, at that time, gender defined the roles ascribed to men and women, not the individuals' temperaments. Roles were created not to allow them to express individuality but, more pragmatically, to run a country. Nor was sexuality important in marriage: whether a woman was fulfilled didn't matter as long as she bred. Now we find ourselves at the other extreme. The pill has revolutionised women's lives - but the freedom it has brought can still be used against us. </p> <p>In one sense, the Russian aristocracy were very honest about sex and love. Marriage was about blood and property, and affairs were acceptable. Anna's great betrayal is not of her husband but of society. She blows the roof off it when she falls in love and its hypocrisy and cruelty eventually destroy her. Today, the stigma of affairs is more personal but women are still contrained by social mores: Anna could now apply for visiting rights - but she may still be penalised for being a single mother. </p> <p>Back then, emotional fulfilment was as likely to be discovered through one's relationship with God as with a lover. It is a very recent phenomenon to expect such totality from a partner. People then didn't marry thinking they were getting the complete package: best friend, lover, careers adviser. In a more realistic era, there was no sense of the holy grail of perfect union. </p> <p>Just before she kills herself, Anna says to her lover: \"I don't know who I am, Vronsky, I only know my appetites.\" She ultimately sacrifices herself for those appetites, but she has truly lived since Vronsky awakened her and I admire her so for that. </p> <p>How should a woman live her life? By the end of the story, Anna's choice is to return to her husband, disgraced, and live a lie, or to say: \"I did it, I've lived and that's enough.\" She jumps, not from something but to something. There is no defeat. It's wonderful to see a woman playing the heroine.</p>",

Angel Maturino Resendiz is so far charged with only one of the murders, but is suspected of killing six people in Texas, two in Illinois and one in Kentucky between 1997 and 1999 as he criss-crossed the US, hitching lifts in open freight wagons, leaving a trail of blood behind him and focusing attention on an itinerant sub-culture living on America's railway system. Mr Resendiz's lawyers entered a plea of insanity yesterday after overcoming their client's objections, but a prosecutor in the Houston courtroom demanded the death penalty for what he said was \"one of the most horrible events you will ever have the misfortune of hearing\". The FBI identified Mr Resendiz as a suspect after officers realised the killings all took place near railway tracks and began interviewing other drifters. He surrendered three weeks after being placed on the FBI's \"ten most wanted\" list last year. The trial, which opened in Texas yesterday, focuses on the robbery, rape and murder of a doctor, Claudia Benton. The prosecution said that fingerprints and DNA samples taken from the Ms Benton's home linked Mr Resendiz to the crime. The defendant's wife later handed in jewellery she suspected he had stolen from Benton. \"There is good, hard physical evidence that will be difficult to refute,\" a spokesman for the Texas police, said. If Mr Resendiz is convicted of the Benton murder, prosecutors say they may bring up the other eight killings for consideration before sentencing. \"I don't want to overwhelm the jury with all these capital murders, but I still want to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Devon Anderson, one of the prosecutors, told journalists. Speaking for the defence, Mr Resendiz's lawyer, Allen Tanner said: \"The defendant has no remorse for any of his crimes. The defendant in his mind thinks these people were evil and deserved to die.\" Mr Tanner read letters written by Mr Resendiz in which he talked about micro-organisms infecting the human body, travel on light-waves to other galaxies and being an angel of God \"feared by all\".

It is painful to see a hippy masquerading as an enemy of the state. This wasn't their brief, one feels, nor was it within their remit to merge anti-capitalism with ecology. The desecration of the planet is just one of many consequences of the global economy. Another is the cost to humanity of living within a system which commodifies everything. It may well be some time before the seeds of the latter anxiety produces a more competent cadre than a bunch of mud-wrestling knobheads, but one thing, at least, is certain. The movement which emerges will be the result of a huge humanitarian outburst, not a spin-off from the fight for cheaper fares.</p> <p>\u0095 I knew there was something wrong with Ken Livingstone's victory party the minute I walked in the door. The Blackfriars venue was predictable enough, as were the heaving masses trying to get a drink at the bar. I looked around for people I knew and drew a blank. Some of them looked vaguely familiar but where were all the men in suits? Where were all the women in discreet Nicole Farhi separates?</p> <p>\"There's something going on here\", I said to the friend I arrived with. \"These people - it looks like a...\" \"Party?\" she suggested, and I realised that was it. I've never been to any political/media gathering that looked so much like a genuine event. There were young people, old people, activists, eccentrics, Camden babes, Islington queens and a representative from just about every class and social grouping in the Greater London area. If you don't think this indicates anything about the man who brought them together, try to picture Dobbo's party and estimate how long you'd have stayed.</p>",

This wasn't their brief, one feels, nor was it within their remit to merge anti-capitalism with ecology. The desecration of the planet is just one of many consequences of the global economy. Another is the cost to humanity of living within a system which commodifies everything. It may well be some time before the seeds of the latter anxiety produces a more competent cadre than a bunch of mud-wrestling knobheads, but one thing, at least, is certain. The movement which emerges will be the result of a huge humanitarian outburst, not a spin-off from the fight for cheaper fares. \u0095 I knew there was something wrong with Ken Livingstone's victory party the minute I walked in the door. The Blackfriars venue was predictable enough, as were the heaving masses trying to get a drink at the bar. I looked around for people I knew and drew a blank. Some of them looked vaguely familiar but where were all the men in suits? Where were all the women in discreet Nicole Farhi separates? \"There's something going on here\", I said to the friend I arrived with. \"These people - it looks like a...\" \"Party?\" she suggested, and I realised that was it. I've never been to any political/media gathering that looked so much like a genuine event. There were young people, old people, activists, eccentrics, Camden babes, Islington queens and a representative from just about every class and social grouping in the Greater London area. If you don't think this indicates anything about the man who brought them together, try to picture Dobbo's party and estimate how long you'd have stayed.",

      "body": "<p>The state of clinical trials in the UK, which allows researchers to treat adult volunteers and their children as human guinea pigs, was exposed yesterday in a damning report from an NHS panel investigating the work of consultant paediatrician David Southall and his colleagues in North Staffordshire. </p> <p>Professor Rod Griffiths of the West Midlands regional NHS executive found that experiments had taken place in North Staffordshire without safeguards to ensure that the parents of babies who took part in random trials knew what was happening and agreed to it. At the centre of the inquiry were trials of an experimental ventilator, the CNEP (continuous negative extrathoracic pressure), which expanded babies' lungs to help them breathe without the need for a tube. But some parents believe the machine, which requires a tight seal around the baby's neck, caused long-term brain damage. </p> <p>Professor Southall, the controversial paediatrician who has been attacked for his use of covert video surveillance of mothers alleged to have harmed their babies, is partly responsible for the inadequacies of the trial, says the report, which calls him \"an enthusiastic and assertive lead researcher\" who did not take enough care in the management of his trials. </p> <p>Parliamentary under secretary of state, Lord Hunt, said last night: \"There needs to be a culture change in the NHS - a shift in the balance of power towards the patient. It has to be wrong that patients can be the last to know what it going on with their treatment.\" A number of the recommendations, including producing guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials, had already been put into place, he added. </p> <p>Professor Griffiths said people taking part must have confidence in the way clinical trials are carried out. \"It is very important for the public to feel that they are not being used as guinea pigs.\" </p> <p><strong> Inadequate</strong><br> </p> <p> But Professor Griffiths' fire is chiefly directed at the inadequate and variable guidelines meant to ensure that patients are safeguarded and treated with dignity and respect. He recommends that the Department of Health produces guidelines to clarify procedures for consent. </p> <p>Professor Griffiths' brief - to look at issues of consent in the CNEP trials - was gradually widened to encompass other research activities of Professor Southall and his team. North Staffordshire hospital has been at the centre of a storm since the paediatrician was first revealed to be using covert video surveillance to try to catch mothers harming their babies. </p> <p>Professor Southall believed that some children rushed to hospital in a critical condition were the victims of Munchausen's by Proxy - that they had mothers who half-smothered them, fed them salt or broke their limbs in order to get attention for themselves. Professor Southall felt that the ends justified the means to protect those children. To get evidence that would stand up in court, he called mothers in to hospital on spurious grounds, left them alone with their babies and filmed what happened. The evidence he garnered from the mid-1980s was enough to have children placed in care. </p> <p>Mothers whose babies had been taken away began to fight back.

      "bodyText": "The state of clinical trials in the UK, which allows researchers to treat adult volunteers and their children as human guinea pigs, was exposed yesterday in a damning report from an NHS panel investigating the work of consultant paediatrician David Southall and his colleagues in North Staffordshire. Professor Rod Griffiths of the West Midlands regional NHS executive found that experiments had taken place in North Staffordshire without safeguards to ensure that the parents of babies who took part in random trials knew what was happening and agreed to it. At the centre of the inquiry were trials of an experimental ventilator, the CNEP (continuous negative extrathoracic pressure), which expanded babies' lungs to help them breathe without the need for a tube. But some parents believe the machine, which requires a tight seal around the baby's neck, caused long-term brain damage. Professor Southall, the controversial paediatrician who has been attacked for his use of covert video surveillance of mothers alleged to have harmed their babies, is partly responsible for the inadequacies of the trial, says the report, which calls him \"an enthusiastic and assertive lead researcher\" who did not take enough care in the management of his trials. Parliamentary under secretary of state, Lord Hunt, said last night: \"There needs to be a culture change in the NHS - a shift in the balance of power towards the patient. It has to be wrong that patients can be the last to know what it going on with their treatment.\" A number of the recommendations, including producing guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials, had already been put into place, he added. Professor Griffiths said people taking part must have confidence in the way clinical trials are carried out. \"It is very important for the public to feel that they are not being used as guinea pigs.\" Inadequate But Professor Griffiths' fire is chiefly directed at the inadequate and variable guidelines meant to ensure that patients are safeguarded and treated with dignity and respect. He recommends that the Department of Health produces guidelines to clarify procedures for consent. Professor Griffiths' brief - to look at issues of consent in the CNEP trials - was gradually widened to encompass other research activities of Professor Southall and his team. North Staffordshire hospital has been at the centre of a storm since the paediatrician was first revealed to be using covert video surveillance to try to catch mothers harming their babies. Professor Southall believed that some children rushed to hospital in a critical condition were the victims of Munchausen's by Proxy - that they had mothers who half-smothered them, fed them salt or broke their limbs in order to get attention for themselves. Professor Southall felt that the ends justified the means to protect those children. To get evidence that would stand up in court, he called mothers in to hospital on spurious grounds, left them alone with their babies and filmed what happened. The evidence he garnered from the mid-1980s was enough to have children placed in care. Mothers whose babies had been taken away began to fight back. The backlash led eventually to a series of inquiries by the North Staffordshire NHS Trust, as well as the inquiry by Professor Griffiths. Professor Southall and his colleague Martin Samuels were suspended last De cember when the trust announced it was investigating personal allegations about their conduct and integrity. They have that inquiry and the General Medical Council, which has also received complaints, still to face.

      "body": "<p>British Telecom looked like the monopolistic clot it has so often been when, three months ago, it threatened to delay the entire auction of third generation mobile phone licences with legal action - in the process risking Britain's lead in a crucial area of technology. </p> <p>It thought it unfair that Vodafone, in the wake of the takeover of Mannesmann, might own two licences at once, even though BT knew very well that Vodafone would have to sell Orange. </p> <p>But after that unsightly tantrum, there is evidence now that, together with mobile rival One2One, the old monolith has something to shriek about. </p> <p>The DTI sensibly bent the rules to allow Vodafone and Orange to bid for separate licences while both were owned - albeit temporarily - by the same company. </p> <p>But there is no reason why they should be given extra time to pay the \u00a310bn they bid for the two licences. </p> <p>The official argument is that they can only pay for and receive their licences once Vodafone has fulfilled its promise to sell Orange. This will take time, so they must be given extra time to pay. </p> <p>But this does not stand up. The rules have already been bent once in their favour. They should be made to pay now, and receive their licences when they have completed their divorce. </p> <p>It is not as if the two operators are working closely together. They are, and will remain, bitter rivals. </p> <p>If they cannot pay, they should lose their licences. If they can pay, they should do so at the same time as everyone else. </p> <p><strong> P&amp;D bears all </strong><br> </p> <p> Dogged determination or bloody mindedness - either way Phillips &amp; Drew is sticking to with its four-year-old bearish stance on the stock market which has hurt its performance, damaged its customer base and cost its investment chief, Tony Dye, his job. </p> <p>In the fund manager's much watched pension fund indicators report, published yesterday, the Swiss-owned fund management company admits that the \"long bull run has been painful for our clients and we are indebted to them to their loyalty\". </p> <p>But the group remains adamant that its views and that loyalty from many of the country's biggest pension funds, will win the day. \"We believe that this loyalty stems from our fundamental approach and our willingness to take a view. Neither of these aspects of our approach is changing and we believe that our clients' forbearance will be repaid as market exuberance fades,\" the report says. </p> <p>In what it admits has been a \"fallow period\" P&amp;D has been rejuvenating its research while speculators have been having more \"fun and profit\" by punting on technology favourites. </p> <p>Yet, by P&amp;D's arithmetic, all this dot.commery, now that it has infected the investment industry's professionals, is wiping at least \u00a3800m a year off the performance of pension funds in Britain. It reaches this conclusion on the basis that pension funds are spending heavy money rejigging their portfolios. This is not only to chase the new economy bandwagon, but also due to structural changes in the market, taking annual turnover levels to around 40% in UK equities - more than double the levels of the mid 1980s. </p> <p>True to form, P&amp;D hopes that this churning of portfolios will start to decline soon, or at least result in the worst offenders being penalised, with clients removing money from them and investing it - presumably in funds run by P&amp;D which will not be subjected to the whims of the market, however attractive the short-term benefits. </p> <p><strong> Dot.better </strong><br> </p> <p> When the Financial Times was relaunched into cyberspace in February and immediately ran into technical problems, there was much upset inside Europe's premier business newspaper when the venture was described in these columns as FT.Completelyuseless. In fact, this was said to be grossly unfair and inaccurate at the time. </p> <p>So it is only fair to point out now -three months on - that the site has been revamped and is beginning to look halfway FT.Competent. </p> <p>News is more accessible and the site layout is much clearer, while the determination to disseminate three-day-old information and computer error screens seems to have been largely overcome. </p> <p>What is more - apparently at the personal instruction of Pearson chief executive Marjorie Scardino - the irritating \"Navigation Bar,\" which in the past slowly imposed itself over a third of the screen, blocking items a user might be reading, has been relegated to an optional function. </p> <p>Peter Martin, the editor of FT.com, clearly knows the importance of listening to customers, even if they also happen to work for competing publications.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British Telecom looked like the monopolistic clot it has so often been when, three months ago, it threatened to delay the entire auction of third generation mobile phone licences with legal action - in the process risking Britain's lead in a crucial area of technology. It thought it unfair that Vodafone, in the wake of the takeover of Mannesmann, might own two licences at once, even though BT knew very well that Vodafone would have to sell Orange. But after that unsightly tantrum, there is evidence now that, together with mobile rival One2One, the old monolith has something to shriek about. The DTI sensibly bent the rules to allow Vodafone and Orange to bid for separate licences while both were owned - albeit temporarily - by the same company. But there is no reason why they should be given extra time to pay the \u00a310bn they bid for the two licences. The official argument is that they can only pay for and receive their licences once Vodafone has fulfilled its promise to sell Orange. This will take time, so they must be given extra time to pay. But this does not stand up. The rules have already been bent once in their favour. They should be made to pay now, and receive their licences when they have completed their divorce. It is not as if the two operators are working closely together. They are, and will remain, bitter rivals. If they cannot pay, they should lose their licences. If they can pay, they should do so at the same time as everyone else. P&amp;D bears all Dogged determination or bloody mindedness - either way Phillips &amp; Drew is sticking to with its four-year-old bearish stance on the stock market which has hurt its performance, damaged its customer base and cost its investment chief, Tony Dye, his job. In the fund manager's much watched pension fund indicators report, published yesterday, the Swiss-owned fund management company admits that the \"long bull run has been painful for our clients and we are indebted to them to their loyalty\". But the group remains adamant that its views and that loyalty from many of the country's biggest pension funds, will win the day. \"We believe that this loyalty stems from our fundamental approach and our willingness to take a view. Neither of these aspects of our approach is changing and we believe that our clients' forbearance will be repaid as market exuberance fades,\" the report says. In what it admits has been a \"fallow period\" P&amp;D has been rejuvenating its research while speculators have been having more \"fun and profit\" by punting on technology favourites. Yet, by P&amp;D's arithmetic, all this dot.commery, now that it has infected the investment industry's professionals, is wiping at least \u00a3800m a year off the performance of pension funds in Britain. It reaches this conclusion on the basis that pension funds are spending heavy money rejigging their portfolios. This is not only to chase the new economy bandwagon, but also due to structural changes in the market, taking annual turnover levels to around 40% in UK equities - more than double the levels of the mid 1980s. True to form, P&amp;D hopes that this churning of portfolios will start to decline soon, or at least result in the worst offenders being penalised, with clients removing money from them and investing it - presumably in funds run by P&amp;D which will not be subjected to the whims of the market, however attractive the short-term benefits. Dot.better When the Financial Times was relaunched into cyberspace in February and immediately ran into technical problems, there was much upset inside Europe's premier business newspaper when the venture was described in these columns as FT.Completelyuseless. In fact, this was said to be grossly unfair and inaccurate at the time. So it is only fair to point out now -three months on - that the site has been revamped and is beginning to look halfway FT.Competent. News is more accessible and the site layout is much clearer, while the determination to disseminate three-day-old information and computer error screens seems to have been largely overcome. What is more - apparently at the personal instruction of Pearson chief executive Marjorie Scardino - the irritating \"Navigation Bar,\" which in the past slowly imposed itself over a third of the screen, blocking items a user might be reading, has been relegated to an optional function. Peter Martin, the editor of FT.com, clearly knows the importance of listening to customers, even if they also happen to work for competing publications.",

      "body": "<p> I have a fantasy of walking into Tate Modern, going up in a lift, then taking a left, a right, a left again, making a long walk to find one thing, one solitary artwork, looking at it, then leaving. Right now that is impossible. The Queen will open Tate Modern at Bankside on Thursday morning. She will hardly, perhaps, realise the importance of the building she is opening. Most of what Tate Modern contains will be a blank to her. There are many things here she would doubtless be alarmed at, dumbfounded, shocked and confused by. There is much here to unsettle us all. </p> <p>The opening of Tate Modern is a watershed in the cultural life of this country. It signals the importance of the art of our times, and its centrality in our culture. Unlike most of the major cities and capitals of the western world, London has never had a museum dedicated to the permanent display of international modern art, and there has never been a museum anywhere on quite this scale. Tate Modern isn't just an extension of an existing museum; it is as important a venture as the Museum of Modern Art in New York or the Pompidou Centre in Paris. Tate Modern is bigger than either. Does that make it better? </p> <p>It is huge. It is the largest modern art museum in the world. Half of it is a vast, echoing space. High up behind the tiers and clerestories are more than 50 galleries, half-galleries, double-height galleries, smaller rooms and ante-chambers comprising six suites of showing spaces on three levels. The galleries are practical, flexible and often extremely beautiful. </p> <p>Nothing prepares you for this. One moment you are plunged into a blacked-out video installation, the next you find yourself in a river-lit pause between galleries, the Thames and the Millennium Bridge below, St Paul's rising across the river. You go from killer set-pieces - a room devoted to the severities of minimalism, say, to small and elegant chambers with few works. Turn again, and a view into the Turbine Hall plunges the eye into a space that feels all the bigger for its containment. </p> <p>After this, Tate Britain at Millbank feels cramped, parsimonious and a bit shabby. Its inadequacies for the job it has had to do are suddenly all too apparent. Standing in Tate Modern, Millbank might as well be as far upstream as Berkshire. And what of the art, those parts of the Tate's collection that the Tate has decided, for reasons undoubtedly as political as they are aesthetic, are Modern rather than British? </p> <p>In common with most modern art museums, the Tate has in the past grouped its collection in terms of movements, isms and historical determinism. You know where you are with an ism. Impressionism begat post-impressionism begat cubism, which sired futurism, expressionism and all manner of errant abstractions. This model, which was never altogether clear and was attended by all manner of bolt-on caveats and contradictions, has been under attack for at least three decades. Artists have always been suspicious of it, when they weren't using it to prove that they themselves were at the sharp end of an inevitable drive towards perfection. Art historians, who once plodded their way up and down the evolutionary slope of artistic development, unsure which way was forward, now view their subject in the light of social history, philosophy, psychoanalysis, linguistics, feminist theory and post-colonial politics. </p> <p>Tate Modern's curators have taken on board the need to present art in a different way, even if paintings still hang on walls, and some sculptures insist on the quaintness of plinths. Taking the 17th-century genres of landscape, the figure (including portraiture and the nude), history painting and allegory, and still life as its categories, the Tate has made four different stabs at presenting its collection. Landscape becomes Landscape/Matter/Environment, the figure is now Nude/Action/Body, and still life is Still Life/Object/Real Life. History/Memory/Society stands, I guess, for everything else. Each of these sections realigns parts of the Tate's collection, as well as a significant number of loans, to tell the story of modern art in four distinct ways on two levels of Tate Modern. </p> <p>We are left with differences, alliances, concordances and gaps. The different thematic groupings at Tate Modern are interchangeable, impermanent and contingent. I am quite happy with this as an idea, as it seems to be the only direction worth pursuing. But really it is a substitute for one's own map. It is also obvious, walking into a room filled with the Tate's surrealist collection, that calling this collection Inner Worlds and locating it in the landscape section is about as arbitrary as you can get. </p> <p>The activity of looking at art demands that, as spectators, we make our own connections. Some of the conjunctions and alignments here - probably too many - are so awful that one hopes they are very temporary indeed. The most glaringly awful moment, perhaps, is the room containing the large, tremblingly beautiful Monet waterlily painting, which for many years hung in the National Gallery, opposite a wall-filling black and white splattery drawing by Richard Long. What do these two artists share, apart from an interest in nature? The perceptual field of the Monet and the all-over effect of the Long wall-drawing have nothing useful to say to or about one another. What does Long's red slate circle, down on the floor like a miniature mountain range, have to say for itself? Suddenly, it is a stone water lily. This is crass. </p> <p>But you get used to the jolts. In a room called The Intelligent Object, Michael Craig-Martin's glass of water that thinks it is an oak tree finds itself with a Georges Braque painting of a glass on a table, a drawing of Duchamp's coffee grinder (the bachelor grinds his own coffee, ho ho), a computer designed by Richard Hamilton and a little Giorgio Morandi 1946 still life. Craig-Martin finds himself again, with one of his simplified line-drawn and coloured-in paintings, alongside Patrick Caulfield, Roy Lichtenstein and some furniture sculptures by Richard Artschwager. Standing here, I feel like I'm turning into Tintin. If I look down I'll find myself surrounded by an outline. </p> <p>Putting the watercolour female figures of Marlene Dumas opposite Matisse's series of relief Backs is quite joyous: the lightness of Dumas's wash figures and the chocolatey heaviness of the Matisse relief bronzes play off one another to mutual advantage. The big, double-height gallery containing classic works of minimal art - Robert Morris's mirrored cubes, a lowering and dangerous Richard Serra, a beautiful </p> <p>Eva Hesse, Don Judd and Carl Andre - is breathtaking. This work is in the Body suite, and it makes sense only in that these quasi-industrial and geometric forms make us aware what gawky, lumpy, strange, compound beings we are. </p> <p>Returning to the History/ Memory/Society section, one moves from a room devoted to Picasso's Weeping Woman and the Spanish Civil War, to a smallish room called The Grid. There, Carl Andre's infamous bricks, a Sol LeWitt wall drawing, a quiet linear painting by Agnes Martin and a stunningly beautiful Jasper Johns white-on-white numbers painting from 1959 (a new loan from the Davros Foundation), are all roped off to one side, so one can't actually see the Johns or the Martin head-on. This is worse than frustrating. The Andre bricks lay half over one of the industrial-looking (but fake) grilles in the floor, part of the gallery's climate control system. This entire room is a replay of Rosalind Krauss's 1978 essay on the grid, recontextualised to highlight the grid's metaphoric relation to social order. Whether it is always what the artists had in mind is another matter. </p> <p>On we go, walking through a room of Frank Auerbach paintings straight into Joseph Beuys. What do these two artists share? A belief in unseen forces, perhaps, which in Auerbach's paintings are evidenced by angular vectors in the sky. The Beuys room is one of the most beautiful galleries in Tate Modern. This tall space, illuminated by daylight streaming in through Giles Gilbert Scott's original bank of narrow windows, is gorgeous but much too crowded. Beuys's overwhelming Lightning with Stag in its Glare, with its huge suspended lump and smaller, delicate elements arranged on the floor about it, is somehow diminished and confused by the plugged stones of his equally monumental End of the Twentieth Century, and all the other bits of Beuysabilia, the vitrines and blackboards that share the room. </p> <p>But you can see why the Tate might want to display as much as possible, and be suspicious of presenting art as spectacle. Especially - the uncharitable thought creeps into my head - when so many lenders of works and donators of collections are in town. The benefactors want to see what they've handed over. </p> <p>I'm carping. I don't really mind all these problematic moments. This, surely, is all part of the unending job of making sense of the past and the present. Never before has so much of the Tate's holdings been on show. Some of the rooms devoted to individuals - Tony Cragg, Andy Warhol and Bruce Nauman - are great. The conjunction of Giacometti's sculptures with two Barnett Newman paintings is splendid. I'm so happy to see Absalon here, with one of his singular white habitations - even if you can't go inside it - and it is good to see the resuscitation of 40s and 50s French art, especially Fautrier's Hostage heads, his grim, effaced echoes of Medardo Rosso. Sarah Lucas finally meets Hans Bellmer in a deliciously nasty room of uncomfortable objects, which also collides a macabre Chapman brothers machine with Dali's lobster telephone. A Robert Gober leg pokes out of the wall, down at ground level in a corner. Sometimes small moments have the greatest effect. </p> <p>The collection might be weirdly arranged, but overall the past 100 years or so of art make a kind of broad sense here. Make your own minds up about the layout and look at the art. These exhibition suites are not zones, and Tate Modern isn't a dome. There might be a tendency to make too many spurious connections, but it doesn't matter. We are free to go wherever we choose, to look and to ignore. Our sense of history and of the present is in perpetual crisis, and attended by an endless doubt that no amount of curatorial spin, or trying-to-be-helpful information panels written by the curators, will dispel. Remember, they are as confounded by art, and history, as the rest of us. </p> <p>The display, flawed and problematic as it is, reminds us that modern art is still an experiment, rather than a linear progression of indisputable masterpieces. There's a moral here somewhere. Whatever feels transient and deficient, or modish and awkward about the displays in Tate Modern, I am unashamed of my enthusiasm for so much of the work here I can forgive almost anything. This is great.</p>",

The activity of looking at art demands that, as spectators, we make our own connections. Some of the conjunctions and alignments here - probably too many - are so awful that one hopes they are very temporary indeed. The most glaringly awful moment, perhaps, is the room containing the large, tremblingly beautiful Monet waterlily painting, which for many years hung in the National Gallery, opposite a wall-filling black and white splattery drawing by Richard Long. What do these two artists share, apart from an interest in nature? The perceptual field of the Monet and the all-over effect of the Long wall-drawing have nothing useful to say to or about one another. What does Long's red slate circle, down on the floor like a miniature mountain range, have to say for itself? Suddenly, it is a stone water lily. This is crass. But you get used to the jolts. In a room called The Intelligent Object, Michael Craig-Martin's glass of water that thinks it is an oak tree finds itself with a Georges Braque painting of a glass on a table, a drawing of Duchamp's coffee grinder (the bachelor grinds his own coffee, ho ho), a computer designed by Richard Hamilton and a little Giorgio Morandi 1946 still life. Craig-Martin finds himself again, with one of his simplified line-drawn and coloured-in paintings, alongside Patrick Caulfield, Roy Lichtenstein and some furniture sculptures by Richard Artschwager. Standing here, I feel like I'm turning into Tintin. If I look down I'll find myself surrounded by an outline. Putting the watercolour female figures of Marlene Dumas opposite Matisse's series of relief Backs is quite joyous: the lightness of Dumas's wash figures and the chocolatey heaviness of the Matisse relief bronzes play off one another to mutual advantage. The big, double-height gallery containing classic works of minimal art - Robert Morris's mirrored cubes, a lowering and dangerous Richard Serra, a beautiful Eva Hesse, Don Judd and Carl Andre - is breathtaking. This work is in the Body suite, and it makes sense only in that these quasi-industrial and geometric forms make us aware what gawky, lumpy, strange, compound beings we are. Returning to the History/ Memory/Society section, one moves from a room devoted to Picasso's Weeping Woman and the Spanish Civil War, to a smallish room called The Grid. There, Carl Andre's infamous bricks, a Sol LeWitt wall drawing, a quiet linear painting by Agnes Martin and a stunningly beautiful Jasper Johns white-on-white numbers painting from 1959 (a new loan from the Davros Foundation), are all roped off to one side, so one can't actually see the Johns or the Martin head-on. This is worse than frustrating. The Andre bricks lay half over one of the industrial-looking (but fake) grilles in the floor, part of the gallery's climate control system. This entire room is a replay of Rosalind Krauss's 1978 essay on the grid, recontextualised to highlight the grid's metaphoric relation to social order. Whether it is always what the artists had in mind is another matter. On we go, walking through a room of Frank Auerbach paintings straight into Joseph Beuys. What do these two artists share? A belief in unseen forces, perhaps, which in Auerbach's paintings are evidenced by angular vectors in the sky. The Beuys room is one of the most beautiful galleries in Tate Modern. This tall space, illuminated by daylight streaming in through Giles Gilbert Scott's original bank of narrow windows, is gorgeous but much too crowded. Beuys's overwhelming Lightning with Stag in its Glare, with its huge suspended lump and smaller, delicate elements arranged on the floor about it, is somehow diminished and confused by the plugged stones of his equally monumental End of the Twentieth Century, and all the other bits of Beuysabilia, the vitrines and blackboards that share the room. But you can see why the Tate might want to display as much as possible, and be suspicious of presenting art as spectacle. Especially - the uncharitable thought creeps into my head - when so many lenders of works and donators of collections are in town. The benefactors want to see what they've handed over. I'm carping. I don't really mind all these problematic moments. This, surely, is all part of the unending job of making sense of the past and the present. Never before has so much of the Tate's holdings been on show. Some of the rooms devoted to individuals - Tony Cragg, Andy Warhol and Bruce Nauman - are great. The conjunction of Giacometti's sculptures with two Barnett Newman paintings is splendid. I'm so happy to see Absalon here, with one of his singular white habitations - even if you can't go inside it - and it is good to see the resuscitation of 40s and 50s French art, especially Fautrier's Hostage heads, his grim, effaced echoes of Medardo Rosso. Sarah Lucas finally meets Hans Bellmer in a deliciously nasty room of uncomfortable objects, which also collides a macabre Chapman brothers machine with Dali's lobster telephone. A Robert Gober leg pokes out of the wall, down at ground level in a corner. Sometimes small moments have the greatest effect. The collection might be weirdly arranged, but overall the past 100 years or so of art make a kind of broad sense here. Make your own minds up about the layout and look at the art. These exhibition suites are not zones, and Tate Modern isn't a dome. There might be a tendency to make too many spurious connections, but it doesn't matter. We are free to go wherever we choose, to look and to ignore. Our sense of history and of the present is in perpetual crisis, and attended by an endless doubt that no amount of curatorial spin, or trying-to-be-helpful information panels written by the curators, will dispel. Remember, they are as confounded by art, and history, as the rest of us. The display, flawed and problematic as it is, reminds us that modern art is still an experiment, rather than a linear progression of indisputable masterpieces. There's a moral here somewhere. Whatever feels transient and deficient, or modish and awkward about the displays in Tate Modern, I am unashamed of my enthusiasm for so much of the work here I can forgive almost anything. This is great.",

      "body": "<p>Having spent the weekend annihilating ant colonies with a boiling kettle, I felt more than a little predisposed to watch a documentary about military tactics. Happily, Churchill v Hitler: The Duel (C4) satisfied on many fronts. Firstly, with its stupendously moronic title: the sort of thing Mel Brooks would have rejected as being too crass in favour of Springtime For Hitler. Secondly, as a surprising love story. </p> <p>The hero of our tale is John Colville, Churchill's private secretary, who began the war viewing the world from the top of a horse. \"As I dismounted, my secretary told me Holland and Belgium had been invaded\" (how damned inconvenient). </p> <p>The arrival of Churchill was greeted with all the snobby anticipation of a scholarship oik arriving at Harrow. \"I bought a cheap and sensational suit,\" wrote Colville in his diary, \"befitting of the new administration.\" </p> <p>The Wodehousian \"Chips\" Channon called it \"the darkest day in England's history\". Did he mean the war or Churchill? The old-school appeasers were so worried about their upper-class cartel being broken up by \"that ghastly man\", they'd forgotten who the real enemy was. </p> <p>The film, a kind of homo-erotic English Patient, was a slow burner. You knew that a broken heart would lie at the end of it all, but whose and by whom? Occasionally, the over-literal sound-effects broke the reverie. \"Hitler boarded a train\" (tssch tssch), \"then took a car\" (peep peep) and \"eventually, was reunited with his dogs\" (woof). </p> <p>Hitler and Churchill were both passionate men. Churchill loved pigs and toothpicks, while Hitler was frequently moved to tears by ten thousand Nazi salutes. The main difference between them was that Churchill was open, while Hitler was secretive: in love and war, which may explain why Churchill won on two fronts. Both admired each other from a distance, the way you did in the 40s. </p> <p>At Berchtesgaden, individual passions intensified. Hitler's secretary noted that \"none of us were ever allowed to see him in his underpants.

      "bodyText": "Having spent the weekend annihilating ant colonies with a boiling kettle, I felt more than a little predisposed to watch a documentary about military tactics. Happily, Churchill v Hitler: The Duel (C4) satisfied on many fronts. Firstly, with its stupendously moronic title: the sort of thing Mel Brooks would have rejected as being too crass in favour of Springtime For Hitler. Secondly, as a surprising love story. The hero of our tale is John Colville, Churchill's private secretary, who began the war viewing the world from the top of a horse. \"As I dismounted, my secretary told me Holland and Belgium had been invaded\" (how damned inconvenient). The arrival of Churchill was greeted with all the snobby anticipation of a scholarship oik arriving at Harrow. \"I bought a cheap and sensational suit,\" wrote Colville in his diary, \"befitting of the new administration.\" The Wodehousian \"Chips\" Channon called it \"the darkest day in England's history\". Did he mean the war or Churchill? The old-school appeasers were so worried about their upper-class cartel being broken up by \"that ghastly man\", they'd forgotten who the real enemy was. The film, a kind of homo-erotic English Patient, was a slow burner. You knew that a broken heart would lie at the end of it all, but whose and by whom? Occasionally, the over-literal sound-effects broke the reverie. \"Hitler boarded a train\" (tssch tssch), \"then took a car\" (peep peep) and \"eventually, was reunited with his dogs\" (woof). Hitler and Churchill were both passionate men. Churchill loved pigs and toothpicks, while Hitler was frequently moved to tears by ten thousand Nazi salutes. The main difference between them was that Churchill was open, while Hitler was secretive: in love and war, which may explain why Churchill won on two fronts. Both admired each other from a distance, the way you did in the 40s. At Berchtesgaden, individual passions intensified. Hitler's secretary noted that \"none of us were ever allowed to see him in his underpants. This fear of laying himself open to ridicule also lay behind his refusal to wear his much-loved leather shorts.\" Hitler's suppressed fetishism contrasted with Churchill's solitary nights: loosely tied dressing gown, whisky in one hand, depression in the other. Colville noted dryly: \"There is always the inescapable suspicion that he loves war.\" Hitler, too, had only one passion: \"My lover is Germany.\" In the end, it was not to be between Churchill and Hitler. Adolf went up in Wagnerian flames with Eva, but not before telling his secretary: \"I never wanted children, because the ascendants (descendants?) of a genius always have a hard time in the world... besides, they usually turn out to be idiots.\" Trading Blows: Hot Dog Wars (C5) covered similar territory: Lebensraum and scorched earth.

      "body": "<p>Worrying news from a Gallup survey, released yesterday to mark the beginning of RSPCA week. Women are turning to pets for comfort instead of partners. And to what pets are they turning? Dogs. According to the survey, dogs are no longer man's best friend but are now woman's best friend.</p> <p>They think this is news? It isn't news at all. Women have known it for decades but perhaps they haven't dared mention it. The things a woman might do with a dog are, after all, seen as rather suspect: striding about the park, rolling around on the floor, playing ball games, being pack leader. This is robust boys' stuff. The woman must be lesbian. Or she's inadequate. Form an emotional bond with your dog, cry when it has an operation, miss it when you go away, kiss it when you get back, and the dog is your substitute baby/partner/lover/friend, because you can't manage human relationships. This is the best you can do - a dog. And a dog isn't much to be proud of. It's a term of abuse, an ugly woman or a rotten man.</p> <p>No wonder many women affect to prefer cats. Cats are allowed. They are pretty, fluffy and independent. You don't have to be embarrassed about being emotionally attached to a cat. How can you be? You let it out at night, you haven't a clue what it's up to and you don't mind. You are separate beings - like a proper adult with a well-adjusted chld. And when your cat's around, you can sit down prettily on a chair and stroke it calmly. It doesn't come running in from the garden spattering mud and slobber and hump your leg in front of visitors. It vomits and farts rather more discreetly than a dog.</p> <p>Of course there are dinky little dogs that will sit in your lap. I hear Geri Halliwell has a weeny shih-tzu, Madonna has a chihuahua, Liz Taylor has a Maltese terrier, and that's more acceptable. Or is it? Geri might get away with it but who admires an old lady with a lap dog? No one. She's probably slightly dotty and lonely, and no one loves her.</p> <p>But now women are getting bolder. We don't mind admitting we love the dog and there are official reasons why we should. A dog is good for the heart, it gets you up in the morning, makes you exercise, shapes your day, gives you purpose. In our house, the dog is vital. It protects my mother from burglars while I'm out (at least she thinks it will) and diffuses rows - outbursts of temper upset it so much that we all try to control ourselves. And of course it loves me unconditionally.</p> <p>It also empathises more than a cat and is beautiful to look at, endlessly entertaining and amusing. With all those qualities, it is no surprise that if one is looking for pleasure, a dog is more reliable than a partner. A partner may argue, deceive, sulk and watch football. I mention football because of course I suspect that male partners are more likely to be jealous of a dog and found wanting in a partnership. No wonder there has been a general effort to rubbish women's relationships with dogs, if they threaten to put men in the shade.</p> <p>No one wants women frittering their affection, emotion, time and energy on dogs. Or any animals, come to that. Which is perhaps why stereotypes and myths are legion in the area, and not just about dogs. Have a cat and you're a lonely old spinster or a witch. Have a horse and you've got all the dog problems plus general sneering about why girls want to sit on them. Have more than one dog, cat or whatever and the criticism increases. Open an animal sanctuary and you're a serious weirdo - think Carla Lane, Celia Hammond, Bridget Bardot and those elderly ladies who look after chimps and donkeys.</p> <p>It isn't much of an excuse, but we were brought up on Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie (looked after by boys), Trigger and Champion the Wonder Horse (ridden by blokes). But maybe attitudes are about to improve. Gallup's survey was carried out for the makers of an endectocide, which will hopefully protect pets from both internal and external parasites. Marvellous. No fleas, roundworms or anything nasty can be caught from the dog. The product aims to \"bring people and their pets closer together\". This must mean that I am at last being encouraged to kiss the dog. I call that progress.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Euronext, the three way alliance of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels bourses, is understood to have had informal talks with the New York stock exchange, raising the prospect of a transatlantic battle of the bourses. The move comes in response to last week's link-up between London, Frankfurt and Nasdaq, which formed the new global iX exchange. Though the deal, which will give Nasdaq access to trading on Frankfurt's Neuer Markt and London's Techmark, has been overshadowed to an extent by the parallel plan for a full merger between the two European exchanges, some observers believe the transatlantic tie-up could be the more important. Nasdaq's link with London and Frankfurt, which replaces its original plan to start its own pan-European share trading system, is said to have given the New York stock exchange and other European bourses pause for thought. \"They have seen what has happened between London, Frankfurt and Nasdaq. Obviously they are concerned,\" according to one European source. \"The months to come could be very interesting.\" A possible link-up between Euronext and the New York stock exchange would further complicate the increasingly tangled and competitive relationships between stock markets as initial pan-European ambitions are widened to encompass global links. The Nasdaq connection would give the merged London/Frankfurt exchange - iX - the potential for links into Asia as well as the US. The other European bourses would clearly be reluctant to allow themselves to fall behind the two big European exchanges or to become isolated. When Euronext was launched - in London - earlier this year its architects made it clear that they were keen to see others, particularly the London Stock Exchange, join their system. iX is also open to further members. Madrid and Milan, for example, have already signed memoranda of understanding about discussions with a view to joining iX. Demand for pan-European share dealing is being driven by the big financial institutions which want to see a single trading platform - complete with integrated clearing and settlement. A combination of advances in technology and the intro duction of the single European currency has made the idea of pan-European trading feasible while demands from the institutions for lower costs have made it imperative. The traditional bourses are already facing a challenge from newer exchanges like Tradepoint, Jiway and Easdaq which are keen to carve out places for themselves in the pan-European market. But most of the big financial institutions are more global than the exchanges and would be keen to see links between markets in different time zones. Paris and the NYSE both declined to comment.",

He defended the proposal to advertise escort agencies and private investigators. \"We shouldn't presume such agencies are perpetrating illegal acts, and, if they're not doing so, it's not clear that leads to a case for banning them, although the rules governing scheduling might need to be extended to buttress it.\" The proposals were greeted with disquiet by Jocelyn Hay, chair of The Voice of the Listener and Viewer, who said she was \"very concerned\" about the endorsement of medical products by celebrities. \"There seem to be very good reasons for not allowing any of these types of adverts, and we need to look very much more closely at this before radically changing regulation.\" But the Advertising Association, the industry's umbrella body, and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, which represents 200 advertising agencies, said they welcomed the consultation. \"We don't want a total deregulation but we would like to see the ITC take a more generalist approach and allow anything that's legal, honest and truthful,\" said Simon Gallang, the IPA's legal affairs consultant. \"To have a blanket ban on something as innocuous as a private investigations agency doesn't make good sense, while escort agencies could be advertised on a subscription channel with a pin number.\" He added that he thought every advertisement should be looked at on its own merits. Products and services which could be advertised under the new proposals \u0095 Commercial services offering advice on personal or consumer problems \u0095 Private investigation agencies \u0095 Escort agencies \u0095 Schemes in which people are employed at home, such as addressing envelopes or making toys or garments \u0095 Instructional courses \u0095 Products to treat alcoholism \u0095 Clinics for the treatment of hair loss \u0095 Pregnancy testing services \u0095 Hypnosis, psychology, psychoanalysis, psychiatry, and hypnotherapy",

He played down suggestions that he would mastermind either his wife's senate campaign or Al Gore's presidential bid. \"If they ask my advice, I give it to them,\" he said. \"But it's way over-rated.\" For analysts of the embattled Clinton marriage, the surprise announcement offers mixed signals. If Mrs Clinton wins the New York senate seat, the couple will clearly live apart, but the president still feels sufficiently part of the Rodham family to live with Dorothy. Or perhaps it simply means the world's most famous unfaithful husband is now less frightened of his mother-in-law than of his wife.",

      "bodyText": "A police officer raised serious concerns about the way evidence was handled in the early stages of the investigation of the Lockerbie bombing, a court heard yesterday at the trial of two Libyans accused of murdering 270 people. On day four of the trial retired police officer Douglas Roxburgh, 63, said he had told the chief inspector of Dumfries and Galloway police that he was anxious about the way certain agencies were removing evidence in the aftermath of the 1988 bombing without logging it first with police. Under cross-examination by defence counsel, Richard Keen QC, Mr Roxburgh told the Scottish court, sitting in the Netherlands, he was concerned that air accident investigation branch officials or British military explosives experts had removed a piece of aircraft wreckage. Mr Roxburgh's concerns emerged shortly after he told the court of the painstaking operation to record and store the large amounts of debris which rained down on Lockerbie after Pan Am flight 103 was blown from the night sky. Aircraft debris was transferred to a Ministry of Defence base, where investigators attempted to piece back together the Boeing 747. But suitcases and bags were sifted through by police officers, who would decide what was needed for the inquiry and what could be returned to relatives. Abdelbaset Ali Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah face charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and breaches of the aviation security act at the hearing at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. The Libyans are alleged by the crown to have been working for the Libyan intelligence services when they planted a bomb concealed in a Toshiba radio cassette recorder and triggered by a Swiss-made timer inside a suitcase which was eventually loaded on to Pan Am flight 103. The lord advocate, Colin Boyd QC, will try to prove that one of 20 bomb timers bought by Libyan secret services from the Swiss firm MEBO was used to blow up the jumbo jet. The accused Libyans plead not guilty to all three charges. They have lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming two Palestinian terrorist organisations and a crown witness - thought to be an Iranian - for the bombing. The trial, before Lord Sutherland, continues today.",

The total fell because of the introduction of the home detention curfew which saw short term prisoners released early with electronic tags.</p> <p>The number of people prosecuted in the courts remained relatively stable at 1.47m but there has been a switch in offences from the crown court to the magistrates' court.

      "bodyText": "The rise in recorded crime is beginning to gather pace amid fears among ministers that the \"crusade against crime\" by the home secretary, Jack Straw, will not prevent the crime rate going up between now and the general election. Home Office figures published yesterday show that police recorded crime rose by 3% to 5.25m offences in 1999, confirming that last year the crime figures rose for the first time in six years. The figures are bound to provide ammunition for the Conservative leader, William Hague, when he tries to build on the momentum of last week's local elections by attacking the government's record on crime at the annual conference of the Police Federation next week. At the same time, new official figures show that a tougher approach is being taken throughout the criminal justice system, with the police less frequently letting people off with a caution and the courts sending more people to prison and using community penalties such as probation less frequently. Although the number of people the courts are sending to prison \"remains high\", the prison population at the end of 1999 was 2,000 down, at 62,100, from a year before. The total fell because of the introduction of the home detention curfew which saw short term prisoners released early with electronic tags. The number of people prosecuted in the courts remained relatively stable at 1.47m but there has been a switch in offences from the crown court to the magistrates' court. This is the result of the introduction in October 1997 of the need for defendants to enter a plea before they are allowed to opt for a crown or magistrates' court hearing. The publication of the quarterly headline crime figures for the first time was accompa nied by the results of new Home Office research on attitudes to crime which show that politicians may have less to worry about than they think when it comes to rising crime figures. Although recorded crime fell by 10% between 1995 and 1997, and had been falling since 1993, the British Crime Survey found that 59% of the public believes it was going up over this period and half believe it had \"increased a lot\". The survey also found that the public has an exaggerated view of how much crime is violent. It found that nearly 80% of people think that a third or more of all recorded crime is violent. But only 8% of crime is recorded as violent, including the more serious woundings and assaults. The public also believes courts are far softer than they are - half the public, for example, thinks that more than 40% of adult rapists are not jailed when the actual figure is less than 1%. Some 80% of people still think that judges are out of touch.",

As many as 40 Labour backbenchers are expected to add to Labour's worries by rebelling over the issue in the Commons tonight. Before the vote Tony Blair will insist that the part-privatisation is exactly the \"tough and unpopular decision\" his government will continue to take. The chancellor also moved yesterday for the first time to try to talk sterling down by saying the present \"sterling-euro exchange rate cannot be justified by any view of the long-term fundamentals\". Mr Brown said he understood \"the great difficulties that the current fall in the euro is causing for British industry, particularly in manufacturing.\" Nevertheless, he ruled out any short fix move to bring sterling down. Some union leaders have been pressing him to use the \u00a320bn revenue from the mobile phone auction to buy euros and so raise its level. Mr Brown tried to woo elderly voters by reminding them he was planning for the next parliament a means-tested pensioners' tax credit targeted at thrifty pensioners with modest savings. The chancellor defended his strategy, saying the first priority was to tackle penioner poverty. The next stage was to ensure that pensioners were not penalised for their thrift, and therefore to do more for penioners with modest occupational pensions and small savings. Details of the credit will be published in the autumn by the social security secretary, Alistair Darling. Labour canvassers have reported deep anger over the basic pension, but Mr Darling rejected restoring the earnings link. Downing Street acknowledged a presentational problem over the basic pension, but said the government would continue to target its resources on the poorest. Mr Brown's chief target yesterday was the institutional investors in the City who control 45% of quoted city equity investments. He has already asked Paul Myners, who is chairing a review group into investment by City institutions, to report back to him in time for the next budget on the \"herd instinct\" amongst City investors. Mr Blair, speaking today at the Periodical Publishers Association, will try to project an unruffled government committed to the long-term by saying he will continue to govern from the radical centre. In his first speech since Labour lost nearly 600 council seats, he will claim: \"Britain is already a different and better country, but there's a huge amount to do.. He will acknowledge poverty in Britain, insisting that a steady economic policy is the best means of protecting those \"without the breaks of birth and wealth, those that cannot survive the violent shifts of boom and bust, and those that rely on increases in living standards not for luxuries, but to make ends meet\". He will contrast the radical centre both with \"the old left which will not face up to the tough decisions\" and with the the Tories \"who will always govern for the many not the few\".",

Before his arrest at the weekend, he told the press that the police were preparing to lock him up as a \"nutcase\" to pre-empt a final assault on a plan which threatens the habitat of the last colony of French bears. As the leader of a group called The Drop of Water, Mr P\u00e9t\u00e9tin has been fined about 30 times since 1988 and jailed eight times for protests along the rural Aspe valley, where a highway is also being built. A judge at Pau, Thierry Pons, opened the way to confinement a fortnight ago when he ordered the eco-warrior, who is famous for the vulture's feather he wears in his hair, to undergo hospital tests after he was fined for destroying equipment used to build the EU-financed Somport tunnel between France and Spain. Mr P\u00e9t\u00e9tin, whose protest has attracted support from thousands of European ecologists, said his occasional \"irrational behaviour\" was due to \"smoking too much pot, or a bad night's sleep\", not insanity. But police said his arrest was provoked by a revolt more dangerous than irrational behaviour, and that he had been confined to a psychiatric hospital because he was mentally unfit to follow normal judicial procedures. According to a gendarmerie report from Pau, a woman motorist said she was forced to hand over her car to Mr P\u00e9t\u00e9tin in the village of Oloron-Sainte-Marie on Sunday. \"Police cars pursued the stolen vehicle through the streets after P\u00e9t\u00e9tin had been seen jumping on the roof shouting there were too many vehicles in the world and they should be eliminated,\" the report said. \"His escape attempt caused several collisions.\" A central government official signed the confinement order, but Mr P\u00e9t\u00e9tin's lawyers are expected to claim that it is an attempt to silence the former scientific researcher, who has been at the centre of environmental protests since 1968.

Diego Pineiro died from multiple stab wounds within an hour of the attack on Sunday evening in the the area known as Seven Dials. His brother was taken to a south London hospital but his injuries were said yesterday not to be life threatening. A 52-year-old man, described by police as an acquaintance of the boys, was arrested at the scene after being disarmed and restrained by two waiters from a local restaurant. Local residents and eyewitnesses said the man, known as Alex, was often seen talking to Diego and hanging around a playground in the courtyard of St Giles's church near the scene of the murder. The attack took place shortly after 8pm at the busy junction as thousands of people enjoyed a balmy evening. Sheikh Salim, 26, a waiter at the Sartaj balti house on Earlham Street, described how he intervened after hearing a scream outside the restaurant. \"I heard this shriek and looked out and saw two boys running and a man chasing them,\" he said. \"One of the boys tripped, clutching his legs, and the man grabbed the other one and started giving him what looked like small rabbit punches - it was only later I realised he was stabbing the boy \"I tried to grab him from behind but he was so tense I couldn't - then I wrestled him to the ground and he elbowed me in the ribs and I fell.

I am too upset to go into it today. Perhaps tomorrow. </p><p>\u0095While awaiting the official opening of the Stephen Glover Spring Festival, we dip into Paper Dreams, Steve's account of the Independent's early days. What quickly strikes the reader is the utter lack of pettiness. When Andreas Whittam Smith makes Sarah Hogg assistant editor, he writes: \"Andreas looked rather guilty because this was officially my exclusive title. I laughed it off as a triviality, though I felt in my heart that he should not have done it.\" I should say not. At the launch party, meanwhile, \"Andreas makes a short speech, thanking everyone for their hard work,\" but fails to name-check Stephen \"as I thought he might.\" What a big man. What a titan. </p><p>\u0095The loyalist Times devotes its splash yesterday (\"Blair: the fightback starts now\") and two inside pages to bolstering Mr Tony, and I am intrigued by a pictorial edition change. In the first edition, a picture of Mr T bringing mugs of coffee (soooo natural) to interviewers Phil Webster and Peter Riddell includes the head of his mother-in-law Gail Booth - the one who's going to look after the Christ child - poking around a door. However, for reasons we can barely guess at, this photo was replaced with three shots of Mr Tony pulling various simian faces. Why anyone objected to the original is odd, but it can hardly be a privacy thing... unless, of course, the Blairs have decided against releasing a single snap of the new baby. </p><p>\u0095As any remaining regular readers will know (see below for the latest defection) this column is a stickler for good manners, so we are not pleased that Labour GLA member and possible deputy mayor Nicky Gavron (former wife of Lord Bobby Gavron, our own erstwhile chairman) was not on time for yesterday's swearing-in of Ken and his merry team. Poorest of shows. Quango queen Nicky may be known at Haringey council as \"the late Councillor Gavron\", but that won't do now. Buck up. </p><p>\u0095The following has arrived in the post, written in blue biro on computer paper. \"Dear Mr Norman, you are obviously under the impression that you are the epitome of wit,\" writes Ex-Reader of Essex. \"Take that Tony Blair! Have some of this Dobbo! Let me assure you, you are not witty in the slightest. You are a pompous wanker. Now f*** off.\" Another one gone to the Indy.</p></b>",

But it's hard to believe that the man best known, you will recall, for handing his tiny baby in to the hat check girl at the Groucho Club did it entirely on his own. \u0095A most shocking thing has happened, and BMW is responsible. I am too upset to go into it today. Perhaps tomorrow. \u0095While awaiting the official opening of the Stephen Glover Spring Festival, we dip into Paper Dreams, Steve's account of the Independent's early days. What quickly strikes the reader is the utter lack of pettiness. When Andreas Whittam Smith makes Sarah Hogg assistant editor, he writes: \"Andreas looked rather guilty because this was officially my exclusive title. I laughed it off as a triviality, though I felt in my heart that he should not have done it.\" I should say not. At the launch party, meanwhile, \"Andreas makes a short speech, thanking everyone for their hard work,\" but fails to name-check Stephen \"as I thought he might.\" What a big man. What a titan. \u0095The loyalist Times devotes its splash yesterday (\"Blair: the fightback starts now\") and two inside pages to bolstering Mr Tony, and I am intrigued by a pictorial edition change. In the first edition, a picture of Mr T bringing mugs of coffee (soooo natural) to interviewers Phil Webster and Peter Riddell includes the head of his mother-in-law Gail Booth - the one who's going to look after the Christ child - poking around a door. However, for reasons we can barely guess at, this photo was replaced with three shots of Mr Tony pulling various simian faces. Why anyone objected to the original is odd, but it can hardly be a privacy thing... unless, of course, the Blairs have decided against releasing a single snap of the new baby. \u0095As any remaining regular readers will know (see below for the latest defection) this column is a stickler for good manners, so we are not pleased that Labour GLA member and possible deputy mayor Nicky Gavron (former wife of Lord Bobby Gavron, our own erstwhile chairman) was not on time for yesterday's swearing-in of Ken and his merry team. Poorest of shows. Quango queen Nicky may be known at Haringey council as \"the late Councillor Gavron\", but that won't do now. Buck up. \u0095The following has arrived in the post, written in blue biro on computer paper. \"Dear Mr Norman, you are obviously under the impression that you are the epitome of wit,\" writes Ex-Reader of Essex. \"Take that Tony Blair! Have some of this Dobbo! Let me assure you, you are not witty in the slightest. You are a pompous wanker. Now f*** off.\" Another one gone to the Indy.",

      "body": "<p>The observers' verdict on the Zimbabwe election was tough. There was intimidation of voters and obstruction of candidates. The publicly owned media were biased. In parts of the country elements of the security forces operated as a \"political army\", and the government ought to have confined them to camps instead of allowing them to terrorise citizens.</p> <p>Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe? No, this was the view of the 11-nation Commonwealth team which observed how the British government and its proconsul Lord Soames ran the elections of 1980 which finally brought Southern Rhodesia, as it then was, to independence. In the thousand of words written about the current clash between Britain and the president of Zimbabwe, almost nothing has been said about Britain's murky performance in the country's historic transition from being a white-run colony to a one-person-one-vote democracy.</p> <p>You did not have to be Mr Mugabe to suspect that Britain hoped he would lose that first majority-rule election. It was clear to every reporter who covered the campaign. More than that, the governor and his staff did as much as they legally could to turn their hopes into action. They tried every conceivable trick to prevent him winning.</p> <p>There was talk of banning Mr Mugabe's party Zanu-PF from campaigning in parts of the country. Lord Soames announced he might not recognise the result in some constituencies if he felt there had been irregularities. His staff warned of possible coups by the white Rhodesian forces if the wrong people, ie Mugabe, seemed to be ahead. The governor toyed with all manner of potential coalitions in order to prevent Mr Mugabe taking power, even if he won the majority of parliamentary seats.</p> <p>The biggest scandal was the way Lord Soames and his officials, in collusion with the Rhodesian army, turned a blind eye to gangs of black thugs, known as \"auxiliaries\", who were loyal to the puppet black prime minister, Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who had been rushed into office to replace the racist Ian Smith. The 35,000 \"auxiliaries\" mainly operated in the Shona villages where the bulk of Mr Mugabe's supporters lived. Because they were part of the official white-led security forces, who were laughably deemed to be \"neutral\", Lord Soames never reined them in.</p> <p>Twenty years later Mr Mugabe is still making political capital by berating Britain. Many of his reasons are opportunistic and unjustified. But his bitterness with Britain for almost stealing his election victory in those majority-rule elections of 1980 undoubtedly still rankles. It must be a factor in his anger and suspicion today, and British politicians ought not to forget it. Aggressive hectoring about the values of democracy does not sit well when it is measured against Britain's own record in Rhodesia.</p> <p>Fortunately, the vote total which Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF amassed in February 1980 was so overwhelming, in spite of Britain's efforts at manipulation, that his victory could not be tweaked away without precipitating a return to guerrilla war. Fortunately, too, the Soames team were so confident before the poll in thinking they had sidelined Mr Mugabe that they had no fall-back position. They were stunned and shocked when his votes piled up but at least they had the realism to accept the result.</p> <p>Zanu-PF acted cleverly to escape the intimidation by the \"auxiliaries\" and deceive the Soames people. I remember covering a Zanu-PF rally two days before the poll in Chinai, a remote area of Mashonaland. Hundreds of people were about to set off on a 48-hour march to the nearest polling station (a shortage of polling stations was one of the government's many techniques). \"If you meet any auxiliaries on the way, and they ask you how you're going to vote,\" a party organiser told the rally, \"tell them 'Muzorewa' so they don't assault you. Your vote is secret so you can still vote for Zanu-PF.\" It worked and the Zanu-PF total was much higher than Lord Soames or the Thatcher government in London expected.</p> <p>This is not to say that Mr Mugabe's people did not also use intimidation on occasion. A number of organisers for the rival guerrilla party, the Patriotic Front, were beaten up. Some were killed. But the final report of the Commonwealth observers concluded that \"intimidation by the guerrillas was by no means as widespread or brutal as official spokesmen claimed\".

      "bodyText": "The observers' verdict on the Zimbabwe election was tough. There was intimidation of voters and obstruction of candidates. The publicly owned media were biased. In parts of the country elements of the security forces operated as a \"political army\", and the government ought to have confined them to camps instead of allowing them to terrorise citizens. Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe? No, this was the view of the 11-nation Commonwealth team which observed how the British government and its proconsul Lord Soames ran the elections of 1980 which finally brought Southern Rhodesia, as it then was, to independence. In the thousand of words written about the current clash between Britain and the president of Zimbabwe, almost nothing has been said about Britain's murky performance in the country's historic transition from being a white-run colony to a one-person-one-vote democracy. You did not have to be Mr Mugabe to suspect that Britain hoped he would lose that first majority-rule election. It was clear to every reporter who covered the campaign. More than that, the governor and his staff did as much as they legally could to turn their hopes into action. They tried every conceivable trick to prevent him winning. There was talk of banning Mr Mugabe's party Zanu-PF from campaigning in parts of the country. Lord Soames announced he might not recognise the result in some constituencies if he felt there had been irregularities. His staff warned of possible coups by the white Rhodesian forces if the wrong people, ie Mugabe, seemed to be ahead. The governor toyed with all manner of potential coalitions in order to prevent Mr Mugabe taking power, even if he won the majority of parliamentary seats. The biggest scandal was the way Lord Soames and his officials, in collusion with the Rhodesian army, turned a blind eye to gangs of black thugs, known as \"auxiliaries\", who were loyal to the puppet black prime minister, Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who had been rushed into office to replace the racist Ian Smith. The 35,000 \"auxiliaries\" mainly operated in the Shona villages where the bulk of Mr Mugabe's supporters lived. Because they were part of the official white-led security forces, who were laughably deemed to be \"neutral\", Lord Soames never reined them in. Twenty years later Mr Mugabe is still making political capital by berating Britain. Many of his reasons are opportunistic and unjustified. But his bitterness with Britain for almost stealing his election victory in those majority-rule elections of 1980 undoubtedly still rankles. It must be a factor in his anger and suspicion today, and British politicians ought not to forget it. Aggressive hectoring about the values of democracy does not sit well when it is measured against Britain's own record in Rhodesia. Fortunately, the vote total which Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF amassed in February 1980 was so overwhelming, in spite of Britain's efforts at manipulation, that his victory could not be tweaked away without precipitating a return to guerrilla war. Fortunately, too, the Soames team were so confident before the poll in thinking they had sidelined Mr Mugabe that they had no fall-back position. They were stunned and shocked when his votes piled up but at least they had the realism to accept the result. Zanu-PF acted cleverly to escape the intimidation by the \"auxiliaries\" and deceive the Soames people. I remember covering a Zanu-PF rally two days before the poll in Chinai, a remote area of Mashonaland. Hundreds of people were about to set off on a 48-hour march to the nearest polling station (a shortage of polling stations was one of the government's many techniques). \"If you meet any auxiliaries on the way, and they ask you how you're going to vote,\" a party organiser told the rally, \"tell them 'Muzorewa' so they don't assault you. Your vote is secret so you can still vote for Zanu-PF.\" It worked and the Zanu-PF total was much higher than Lord Soames or the Thatcher government in London expected. This is not to say that Mr Mugabe's people did not also use intimidation on occasion. A number of organisers for the rival guerrilla party, the Patriotic Front, were beaten up. Some were killed. But the final report of the Commonwealth observers concluded that \"intimidation by the guerrillas was by no means as widespread or brutal as official spokesmen claimed\". It said Lord Soames' failure to confine the auxiliaries to camps \"was a major factor in the ensuing intimidation\", since their activities \"were very much worse than government spokesmen were ever prepared to admit\". Its interim report had slammed Lord Soames and his team for \"a lack of a sufficient degree of impartiality in dealing with the interests of the different parties\". It is no surprise if Mr Mugabe has not forgotten all this, though it is odd that Peter Hain, Britain's \"minister for Africa\" seems to have. He was a stern critic of British colonial policy and the Soames operation at the time, and Robin Cook also took a similar position in those days. The past gives no one a blank cheque, and there is plenty of cause for concern over Mr Mugabe's activities now. He appears to be playing fast and loose with the democratic process, and allowing his activists to use intimidation on a broad scale. He only ratcheted up the latest crisis over the unequal distribution of land after he lost the referendum on the constitution earlier this year. But it is a technique he has used at every election before. This year it just happens to be worse because the opposition to Zanu-PF is stronger, more credible, and better organised than ever. The right response for outsiders is to ensure enough observers go to Zimbabwe to scrutinise the process. Their presence may help to convince voters that the ballot is secret, just as - ironically - Mr Mugabe's organisers did at those village rallies in 1980. But the first priority is to make sure that Mr Mugabe indeed calls the election. South Africa and other Commonwealth friends have been working quietly to press him into taking the plunge. Britain, however, is the last country which should seek to take the lead. It lost its credentials through 15 years of tolerating Ian Smith and then with its role in the 1980 election.

Rather, it is the continued denigration of the public sector, as parasitical, inflexible, wasteful and resistant to change which offends.</p> <p>Even where extra funding has been forthcoming, it has been given with the tone of a concession to terrorists (\"here's the cash, give us the modernisation\") rather than of a government fulfilling the public service needs of its citizens. At the same time, the public sector continues to be bombarded with ill thought-out change programmes, target-setting, league tables and inspections - mostly of dubious value - Until Labour abandons its hostility to the public sector, it is unlikely to receive electoral support from its employees.<br><b>Dr Christopher Grey</b><br> Shepreth, Herts<br>\u0095 I too failed to hold what was considered a safe Labour seat. It is too easy to say, as Sir Jeremy Beecham does (Armchair rebellion alarms Labour, May 6) that Labour supporters stayed at home. In my ward the turnout was the same as last year - indeed marginally up. Last year's Labour majority of 503 was turned this year into a Tory victory of 181 so the stay-at-home theory presupposes that the Tories found nearly 700 new people to vote for them. No, I believe that our core voters (mainly the pensioners who always vote) switched straight across. I doubt that they wanted us to lose the seat; they were simply registering their dissatisfaction with their Labour government.<br><b>Margaret Gooch</b><br>Portsmouth<br><br>\u0095 I have rarely read such rubbish as that from your correspondents blaming the government for Labour losses in the local elections (Letters, May 6). In Exeter we did not lose a single seat. The reasons were simple: a good Labour council working with a popular government to deliver for the city, and a strong, united and extremely well-organised local Labour party that works hard to retain the people's trust.<br><b>Ben Bradshaw MP</b><br> Exeter<br><br>\u0095 I hope Labour asks one question: \"Do we really have to be so boring?\" Do we have to resist every attempt to make the Freedom of Information Act something like we've fought for for years? Couldn't Gordon Brown drop his scolding nanny attitude and say, for example: \"Hey, we've got \u00a322bn I didn't know we would have, let's celebrate and give every hospital in the country a hundred grand to buy a piece of equipment they really want.\" Please, some imagination, some fun. To this 68-year-old, this government looks like a collection of boring old farts. God knows what they look like to their contemporaries.<br><b>Brian Clark</b><br>Brighton, E Sussex<br><br>\u0095 The greatest crime of this government is not any specific act, but the way it has managed to turn almost the entire electorate off politics. They look exactly like the last lot and say all the same things. Where are the new ideas for a network age? We are all part of a vast and intricate web of relationships, and everything that makes our lives worthwhile comes from being connected to others. We depend on others and their work for our sustenance, our opportunities to contribute and be creative. Where is the understanding of that?</p> <p>We are still trying to run our society with ideas developed in the 18th century. We don't live in a small scale, low-tech society.

      "bodyText": "The inquest into Labour's local election results has presumed that the party's heartlands consist of the northern industrial working class and party activists (Heartland blues, May 8). Yet a major part of Labour's core vote comes from public sector employees who had high expectations of new Labour. These have not been met, and only partly because of underfunding. Rather, it is the continued denigration of the public sector, as parasitical, inflexible, wasteful and resistant to change which offends. Even where extra funding has been forthcoming, it has been given with the tone of a concession to terrorists (\"here's the cash, give us the modernisation\") rather than of a government fulfilling the public service needs of its citizens. At the same time, the public sector continues to be bombarded with ill thought-out change programmes, target-setting, league tables and inspections - mostly of dubious value - Until Labour abandons its hostility to the public sector, it is unlikely to receive electoral support from its employees. Dr Christopher Grey Shepreth, Herts \u0095 I too failed to hold what was considered a safe Labour seat. It is too easy to say, as Sir Jeremy Beecham does (Armchair rebellion alarms Labour, May 6) that Labour supporters stayed at home. In my ward the turnout was the same as last year - indeed marginally up. Last year's Labour majority of 503 was turned this year into a Tory victory of 181 so the stay-at-home theory presupposes that the Tories found nearly 700 new people to vote for them. No, I believe that our core voters (mainly the pensioners who always vote) switched straight across. I doubt that they wanted us to lose the seat; they were simply registering their dissatisfaction with their Labour government. Margaret Gooch Portsmouth \u0095 I have rarely read such rubbish as that from your correspondents blaming the government for Labour losses in the local elections (Letters, May 6). In Exeter we did not lose a single seat. The reasons were simple: a good Labour council working with a popular government to deliver for the city, and a strong, united and extremely well-organised local Labour party that works hard to retain the people's trust. Ben Bradshaw MP Exeter \u0095 I hope Labour asks one question: \"Do we really have to be so boring?\" Do we have to resist every attempt to make the Freedom of Information Act something like we've fought for for years? Couldn't Gordon Brown drop his scolding nanny attitude and say, for example: \"Hey, we've got \u00a322bn I didn't know we would have, let's celebrate and give every hospital in the country a hundred grand to buy a piece of equipment they really want.\" Please, some imagination, some fun. To this 68-year-old, this government looks like a collection of boring old farts. God knows what they look like to their contemporaries. Brian Clark Brighton, E Sussex \u0095 The greatest crime of this government is not any specific act, but the way it has managed to turn almost the entire electorate off politics. They look exactly like the last lot and say all the same things. Where are the new ideas for a network age? We are all part of a vast and intricate web of relationships, and everything that makes our lives worthwhile comes from being connected to others. We depend on others and their work for our sustenance, our opportunities to contribute and be creative. Where is the understanding of that? We are still trying to run our society with ideas developed in the 18th century. We don't live in a small scale, low-tech society. It is hardly surprising that it doesn't work.

EU finance ministers meeting in Brussels approved the aid after months of disagreement and heavy pressure from foreign ministers worried about the outbreak of a new Balkans crisis. The money will be paid before next month's local elections, when candidates backed by the Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, are expected to challenge pro-independence Montenegrins. \"This is very good news,\" declared Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, who had been issuing stark warnings that the government of President Milo Djukanovic could be toppled if new aid did not arrive soon. Military pressure and trade sanctions imposed by Belgrade, furious at Podgorica's pro-Nato line during last year's Kosovo crisis, have brought the tiny country of 650,000 to the brink of ruin. Speculation has been rife that the western alliance would have to intervene militarily to support Mr Djukanovic if Belgrade destabilised his government further. After tough talk from Mr Solana and the external relations commissioner, Chris Patten, EU heads of government meeting at the Lisbon summit in March issued a call to support Montenegro.

Serious concerns have also been expressed about the country's culture of \"crony capitalism\", with widespread smuggling - especially of cigarettes and cars - and worries that sending aid would be throwing good money after bad. Last year the Montenegrin foreign minister, Branko Perovic, was forced to resign after an Italian court summoned him and 26 others, including suspected members of the Mafia, to answer allegations of smuggling. EU officials in Montenegro are now expected to be able to monitor how the cash is spent. Having secured his first goal, Mr Solana announced that the EU was also pushing ahead with plans to secure loans worth a further \u00a329.2m to support infrastructure projects in Montenegro.

      "bodyText": "Udham Singh, who symbolised the hockey ethos of India and was three times an Olympic gold medalist, has died aged 71. An inside-forward, he was known for his finesse and fluency of his play during the golden age of Indian hockey. He played in four Olympics - Helsinki in 1952, Melbourne in 1956, Rome 1960 and Tokyo in 1964 - and was unfortunate not to have been in five; only a finger injury stopped him playing at the 1948 games in London. Born in Sansarpur, in the Punjab, considered to be the cradle of Indian hockey, Udham first played for his state at 17. He toured Poland with the Indian national team in 1953, played in the Warsaw International in 1955, and led his country's squad for the 1959 tour of East Africa. Outside of competitive hockey, he became a coach for the Punjab police squads and played a leading role in shaping a host of star Indian players. A stickler for details and a strict disciplinarian, Udham always urged his wards to strive for more. Ignoring the advice of his doctor to recuperate after a heart attack, he was teaching children hockey in his home village when he died. He married for a second time four years ago and leaves his wife and young child. Udham Singh, hockey player, born August 4 1928; died March 23 2000",

      "bodyText": "The controversial art critic Robert Hughes appeared in Broome magistrates' court, Western Australia, yesterday charged with dangerous driving in a case involving extortion and some painful prose. The 61-year-old author of the ground-breaking book Shock of the New was involved in a head-on collision on a quiet stretch of outback road in May last year. He says he has no recollection of the accident. The trial went ahead even though police have charged their two key witnesses, who were in the other car, with conspiring to concoct false evidence. The police allege a plot by the two men to change their evidence in return for \u00a320,000 from Mr Hughes. Mr Hughes's lawyer, Mark Trowell QC, told the court of the extortion attempt late last week and revealed that the men had criminal records. The New York-based Australian-born author was making a BBC documentary, at the time of the accident. He was trapped in the wreckage for hours, lay in a coma for five weeks and received multiple injuries. The prosecution alleges that Mr Hughes, who was driving a rented car, was on the wrong side of the road and speeding, and made no attempt to slow down or swerve when he ploughed into the oncoming vehicle. The speculation is that Mr Hughes, who could face 18 months in jail and a \u00a31,200 fine if convicted, might have forgotten that Australians drive on the left hand side of the road. \"Bones may not just break, they can explode, like a cookie hit by a hammer, and that's what happened to several of mine,\" the Time magazine art critic wrote in the magazine last year. \"Several ribs snapped, their sharp ends driven into the lungs. Collar bone and sternum busted.\" Mr Hughes said recently that he did not see the accident as bad luck because he was lucky to have survived. \"If it had been a couple of inches to the left or right, I could have ended up as a blind, paraplegic eunuch.

      "body": "<p><strong>Howard Goodall</strong></p> <p>Composer and broadcaster. Age 41. TV and film theme scores include Blackadder; Mr Bean; The Vicar of Dibley; Red Dwarf. Compositions include The Hired Man (which won the Ivor Novello Award for best musical); Marlborough Canticles; We are the Burning Fire. Recently presented Howard Goodall's Big Bangs on Channel 4.</p> <p>Like most other new students at university, Howard Goodall went along to Freshers' Fair, where the university clubs and societies try to sign up new members. His only clear notion was that he would like to write music for student revues. And there, in front of him, was a stall with a sign saying Revue.</p> <p>\"I said: 'I've done these musicals', and the bloke behind the stall said: 'OK, my friend will come and see you this evening'.\" Sure enough a young man did call on him. He was called Richard Curtis and he would later write and co-write a string of hit TV scripts, including Blackadder, and the film Four Weddings and a Funeral.</p> <p>The bloke sitting behind the stall was Rowan Atkinson, later to gain fame as Mr Bean. Three weeks later they were putting on a revue called Tongue-Tied, with music by the 18-year-old Goodall.</p> <p>\"Not many people have meetings as fortuitous as that,\" he laughs. \"The show was overshadowed by the obvious fact that Rowan was a comic genius of world order.\"</p> <p>In Tongue-Tied, Goodall recalls doing something never seen in an Oxford revue before: using a synthesiser.\"Up till then, the revues had been accompanied by a jazz ensemble - clever people's music.\" One of the numbers was for a mime character which Atkinson did - the prototype for Mr Bean.</p> <p>\"I had this synthesiser which looked like a telephone exchange and could only play one note at a time.\" </p> <p>Goodall enjoyed the classical English musical education which so many composers have had. At eight, he went to be a choirboy at New College, Oxford. \"The total immersion in music technique at choir schools is a very good starting point.\" He was starting to write little bits and pieces, but nothing which was performed. \"I just liked the look of it on the page and liked the idea of being a composer.\"</p> <p>A stretch at Stowe, the well-known public school, followed. Then a switch to Lord Williams' School, Thame, a \"big jolly comprehensive where the music was fantastic\".</p> <p>At 15, all he wanted to do, he says, was write songs at the piano for his band Halfbrother. It made an album, but you sense he doesn't want to dwell on that too long now.</p> <p>By the sixth form at the comprehensive, he was writing musicals for the youngest children in the school to perform. One was based on John Masefield's The Midnight Folk, another on CS Lewis's The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.</p> <p>He read music at university. The Oxford music course was rigorously academic and on the dry side, with a heavy emphasis on \"techniques of composition\" - rewriting the great composers' works from the 15th to the 20th century, with just the top line or bass to give you clues. It did no harm - far from it.</p> <p>He continued writing for student shows. One of the university drama societies took his musical The Loved One, based on the Evelyn Waugh novel, up to the Edinburgh Festival.</p> <p>\"By then I knew I wanted to write music for a living but I was pretty realistic that most people who want to do it can't.\" It was going to take another eight years after leaving university before he was making his living solely by composing.</p> <p>\"There's no composer in the world who didn\"t have a lean period.\"</p> <p>After Oxford he shared a flat in West London with Rowan Atkinson, who was taking part in a new TV comedy series: Not The Nine O'Clock News. \"Does anybody know somebody who can help play instruments?\" the cast was asked one day. Atkinson mentioned his flatmate. \"I just went in and helped them a bit as a musical director.\"</p> <p>Then it was suggested the show needed an original song in a different style each week, sometimes pastiching well-known singers. The pressure of doing this to order at the last minute was an invaluable experience.</p> <p>\"The big thing I learned was that I was working for other people and that their views mattered a great deal. \"You may write what you think is a gorgeous tune but they say it's not funny or it's not right. The first thing I say to students now is: don't be passionate about the stuff you write. Accept that if you are writing for TV or film you are writing in a visual medium and you are number two. You can't be luvvyish about it.\"</p> <p>His advice to any young composer is to write as much as possible and in as many voices as possible. \"The great composers of the past had usually written a hell of a lot before producing their big stuff. Today people can be slightly lazy and get attached to their own music, hawking around the same piece again and again.</p> <p>\"The best thing to do is just write another piece. Write. Write. Write.\"</p> <p>He has another pet theory, that all concert composers should be made to spend five years writing for film and TV. \"They would learn how to edit their music. If somebody had told Wagner when to stop, he would have produced work you could sit through.\"</p> <p>The collaboration with Atkinson and Curtis continued. He wrote the theme for the phenomenally successful Blackadder series and was paid \u00a3172, which now looks measly if you forget to include the fee he gets every time it's played.</p> <p>Some more struggling composers might envy his luck in hitching up so early with such stars. He says: \"Everybody will find people to work with of their generation. The chances are that you already know people who will be your equivalent in other fields. That's why universities and colleges are so vital.\"</p> <p><strong>Errolyn Wallen</strong></p> <p>Composer and performer in both classical music and jazz. Age 41. Her works include Horseplay, commissioned by the Royal Ballet, two operas, and Are You Worried About the Rising Cost of Funerals - Five Simple Songs. Her first orchestral work, a Percussion Concerto (1994), was commissioned for the BBC's Young Musician of the Year competition. She has written film, TV and radio scores, and worked with such artists as Courtney Pine, Eternal and Des'ree. With her band Ensemble X she is releasing her first album later this year: Meet Me At Harold Moores - a title which refers to the famous London music shop.</p> <p>What finer sentiment from a bunch of musicans than this: \"We don't break down barriers in music... we don't see any.\" They are Ensemble X, the band formed by Errolyn Wallen, and that, according to the blurb for her album Meet Me At Harold Moores, is their motto. If not barriers, there are of course boundaries, otherwise they would not be able to speak of barrier absence.</p> <p>Part of the thrill of listening to the music is the clash and mesh of styles, and the knowledge that you are in the safe hands of someone who is familiar with them, who understands how music works and has grown up with a solid grounding. She can suddenly drop a tone mid track in The Lighthouse, a bewitching slow recitative over some Britten-like folksong progressions, into the theme from Bach's Goldberg Variations, and it is as shocking as the flick in a movie between, say, misty graveside and elegant drawing room. </p> <p>Wallen was born in Belize in Central America and came to London when she was two. She grew up in Tottenham and came to classical music early because her real mbition as a little girl was to be a dancer. Her first compositions were songs for her younger sisters to sing on the way to school. One went: \"It's quarter to nine, We've got plenty of time\".</p> <p>At nine, she started the piano. She was also learning the violin. \"I was terrible at violin. But the piano - I can't remember not being able to read music or finding it hard to play.\" </p> <p>She was always looking for new music. \"I didn't have much guidance. I remember getting out Hansel and Gretel and playing it through.\" Opus 1 was perhaps Frogs and Toads, written when she was nine and which she and her class performed at school.</p> <p>When Wallen was 13 the money became available to send her to boarding school on the Sussex coast. \"There was a really good music teacher who straightened me out. I was introduced to Benjamin Britten and madrigals. My piano playing got better.\" </p> <p>She went to Goldsmiths College, London to study dance and music, and then dropped the dance. \"I was always composing and playing to friends but I didn't have a picture of myself as a composer.\" She set TS Eliot and Dylan Thomas, and her own poetry, to music.</p> <p>She did an M Mus at King's College, London. \"It was a very practical course. Everything we wrote got played.\" At King's she got into \"weird and wonderful\" systems, or minimalist music. She left with the sense of wanting to work with musicians \"but no idea how to go about it\".</p> <p>Somehow she got into playing a lot on the comedy club circuit. She played keyboards with pop bands and with Courtney Pine and his band. All the time she was writing \"other stuff\": string quartets, a Psalm 150 setting. \"Odd pieces would pop out.\"</p> <p>Then, with another musician, she set up a studio and wrote music for film and corporate video. Some concerts mixing her classical stuff with her popular songs went down a wow. And then she founded Ensemble X, her band. \"Don't be frightened to do your own thing. Stick to your guns,\" she advises fledgling composers. \"And try to get as much silence as you can. In order to compose, you sometimes need to be with your own thoughts.\"</p> <p><strong>Nitin Sawhney</strong></p> <p>Composer, performer, comedian, actor, scriptwriter. Age 35. Writes TV and film soundtracks, and commercials. He's a much-in-demand songwriter, producer and remixer. His fourth album Beyond Skin is highly acclaimed.</p> <p>It would be easier to jot down what this man can't do, than what he can. He co-created a comedy double act, The Secret Asians, for instance. It was taken by BBC radio and eventually grew into the award-winning TV sketch show Goodness Gracious Me.</p> <p>For a short time in his mid 20s he was a promising financial controller with a certain hotel group. The crunch came when head office told him he had to sack an employee who had been working with the group for 14 years. \"I thought: 'I don't really want to be this person' and walked out of the job next day.\"</p> <p>He got work playing the piano for a Barry Keefe play Not Fade Away at the Theatre Royal, Stratford, East London and progressed to musical director. It's his four albums since then that he is most proud of, he says. Beyond Skin, for instance, mixes classical Indian qawwali singing, bols - the spoken form of the tablas - and Urdu verse. It also looks for the Indian origin of flamenco.</p> <p>\"I've always been writing music since I was five. I started playing the piano at that age and found myself, particularly with Bach two-part inventions, improvising quite a bit.\"</p> <p>So why, then, was he drifting off text at an age when child pianists have to do their utmost to stay on it?</p> <p>\"Part of the reason was that I was listening to quite a lot of improvisation, mainly at home.\" Fortunately, his father had very wide and varied musical tastes which ranged from \"from Ravi Shankar to flamenco\" with a lot of jazz somewhere in between. At the age of eight, Sawhney bought his first Miles Davis album.</p> <p>He progressed quickly on the piano, whipping through all the grades. \"I was never really focused on the classical side of just playing what was in front of me.I was much more interested in oral forms, that is to say those that are not written down.\"</p> <p>Music, he says, is about gradually exposing what's in the air around the musician. \"That's why I'm very sensitive of what's around me when I'm writing and playing music.\"</p> <p>He still retains vivid memories of his grammar school in Rochester, Kent, where he was the only Asian pupil out of 700 children. Every school day between the ages of 11 and 13 he would be attacked when he walked through the gates in the morning. At the time - the late 1970s - the National Front was active in Rochester, he says. </p> <p>A music teacher would ban him from the piano practice room, where he liked to improvise, on the spurious grounds that he had \"no sheet music\" with him. If he heard the man's footsteps approaching, Sawhney would slip from what he was playing into some convincing-sounding music such as Mozart or Bach, and the steps would move away.</p> <p>But his music was an escape from the daily racism. He would get home and play, three hours on the guitar and three on the piano. Playing as an end in itself, though, wasn't so important to him. \"I guess that's what made me a composer in the end. For me music was much more about escapism. Music is an incredible catharsis if you are lonely.\"</p>",

At eight, he went to be a choirboy at New College, Oxford. \"The total immersion in music technique at choir schools is a very good starting point.\" He was starting to write little bits and pieces, but nothing which was performed. \"I just liked the look of it on the page and liked the idea of being a composer.\" A stretch at Stowe, the well-known public school, followed. Then a switch to Lord Williams' School, Thame, a \"big jolly comprehensive where the music was fantastic\". At 15, all he wanted to do, he says, was write songs at the piano for his band Halfbrother. It made an album, but you sense he doesn't want to dwell on that too long now. By the sixth form at the comprehensive, he was writing musicals for the youngest children in the school to perform. One was based on John Masefield's The Midnight Folk, another on CS Lewis's The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. He read music at university. The Oxford music course was rigorously academic and on the dry side, with a heavy emphasis on \"techniques of composition\" - rewriting the great composers' works from the 15th to the 20th century, with just the top line or bass to give you clues. It did no harm - far from it. He continued writing for student shows. One of the university drama societies took his musical The Loved One, based on the Evelyn Waugh novel, up to the Edinburgh Festival. \"By then I knew I wanted to write music for a living but I was pretty realistic that most people who want to do it can't.\" It was going to take another eight years after leaving university before he was making his living solely by composing. \"There's no composer in the world who didn\"t have a lean period.\" After Oxford he shared a flat in West London with Rowan Atkinson, who was taking part in a new TV comedy series: Not The Nine O'Clock News. \"Does anybody know somebody who can help play instruments?\" the cast was asked one day. Atkinson mentioned his flatmate. \"I just went in and helped them a bit as a musical director.\" Then it was suggested the show needed an original song in a different style each week, sometimes pastiching well-known singers. The pressure of doing this to order at the last minute was an invaluable experience. \"The big thing I learned was that I was working for other people and that their views mattered a great deal. \"You may write what you think is a gorgeous tune but they say it's not funny or it's not right. The first thing I say to students now is: don't be passionate about the stuff you write. Accept that if you are writing for TV or film you are writing in a visual medium and you are number two. You can't be luvvyish about it.\" His advice to any young composer is to write as much as possible and in as many voices as possible. \"The great composers of the past had usually written a hell of a lot before producing their big stuff. Today people can be slightly lazy and get attached to their own music, hawking around the same piece again and again. \"The best thing to do is just write another piece. Write. Write. Write.\" He has another pet theory, that all concert composers should be made to spend five years writing for film and TV. \"They would learn how to edit their music. If somebody had told Wagner when to stop, he would have produced work you could sit through.\" The collaboration with Atkinson and Curtis continued. He wrote the theme for the phenomenally successful Blackadder series and was paid \u00a3172, which now looks measly if you forget to include the fee he gets every time it's played. Some more struggling composers might envy his luck in hitching up so early with such stars. He says: \"Everybody will find people to work with of their generation. The chances are that you already know people who will be your equivalent in other fields. That's why universities and colleges are so vital.\" Errolyn Wallen Composer and performer in both classical music and jazz. Age 41. Her works include Horseplay, commissioned by the Royal Ballet, two operas, and Are You Worried About the Rising Cost of Funerals - Five Simple Songs. Her first orchestral work, a Percussion Concerto (1994), was commissioned for the BBC's Young Musician of the Year competition. She has written film, TV and radio scores, and worked with such artists as Courtney Pine, Eternal and Des'ree. With her band Ensemble X she is releasing her first album later this year: Meet Me At Harold Moores - a title which refers to the famous London music shop. What finer sentiment from a bunch of musicans than this: \"We don't break down barriers in music... we don't see any.\" They are Ensemble X, the band formed by Errolyn Wallen, and that, according to the blurb for her album Meet Me At Harold Moores, is their motto. If not barriers, there are of course boundaries, otherwise they would not be able to speak of barrier absence. Part of the thrill of listening to the music is the clash and mesh of styles, and the knowledge that you are in the safe hands of someone who is familiar with them, who understands how music works and has grown up with a solid grounding. She can suddenly drop a tone mid track in The Lighthouse, a bewitching slow recitative over some Britten-like folksong progressions, into the theme from Bach's Goldberg Variations, and it is as shocking as the flick in a movie between, say, misty graveside and elegant drawing room. Wallen was born in Belize in Central America and came to London when she was two. She grew up in Tottenham and came to classical music early because her real mbition as a little girl was to be a dancer. Her first compositions were songs for her younger sisters to sing on the way to school. One went: \"It's quarter to nine, We've got plenty of time\". At nine, she started the piano. She was also learning the violin. \"I was terrible at violin. But the piano - I can't remember not being able to read music or finding it hard to play.\" She was always looking for new music. \"I didn't have much guidance. I remember getting out Hansel and Gretel and playing it through.\" Opus 1 was perhaps Frogs and Toads, written when she was nine and which she and her class performed at school. When Wallen was 13 the money became available to send her to boarding school on the Sussex coast. \"There was a really good music teacher who straightened me out. I was introduced to Benjamin Britten and madrigals. My piano playing got better.\" She went to Goldsmiths College, London to study dance and music, and then dropped the dance. \"I was always composing and playing to friends but I didn't have a picture of myself as a composer.\" She set TS Eliot and Dylan Thomas, and her own poetry, to music. She did an M Mus at King's College, London. \"It was a very practical course. Everything we wrote got played.\" At King's she got into \"weird and wonderful\" systems, or minimalist music. She left with the sense of wanting to work with musicians \"but no idea how to go about it\". Somehow she got into playing a lot on the comedy club circuit. She played keyboards with pop bands and with Courtney Pine and his band. All the time she was writing \"other stuff\": string quartets, a Psalm 150 setting. \"Odd pieces would pop out.\" Then, with another musician, she set up a studio and wrote music for film and corporate video. Some concerts mixing her classical stuff with her popular songs went down a wow. And then she founded Ensemble X, her band. \"Don't be frightened to do your own thing. Stick to your guns,\" she advises fledgling composers. \"And try to get as much silence as you can. In order to compose, you sometimes need to be with your own thoughts.\" Nitin Sawhney Composer, performer, comedian, actor, scriptwriter. Age 35. Writes TV and film soundtracks, and commercials. He's a much-in-demand songwriter, producer and remixer. His fourth album Beyond Skin is highly acclaimed. It would be easier to jot down what this man can't do, than what he can. He co-created a comedy double act, The Secret Asians, for instance. It was taken by BBC radio and eventually grew into the award-winning TV sketch show Goodness Gracious Me. For a short time in his mid 20s he was a promising financial controller with a certain hotel group. The crunch came when head office told him he had to sack an employee who had been working with the group for 14 years. \"I thought: 'I don't really want to be this person' and walked out of the job next day.\" He got work playing the piano for a Barry Keefe play Not Fade Away at the Theatre Royal, Stratford, East London and progressed to musical director. It's his four albums since then that he is most proud of, he says. Beyond Skin, for instance, mixes classical Indian qawwali singing, bols - the spoken form of the tablas - and Urdu verse. It also looks for the Indian origin of flamenco. \"I've always been writing music since I was five. I started playing the piano at that age and found myself, particularly with Bach two-part inventions, improvising quite a bit.\" So why, then, was he drifting off text at an age when child pianists have to do their utmost to stay on it? \"Part of the reason was that I was listening to quite a lot of improvisation, mainly at home.\" Fortunately, his father had very wide and varied musical tastes which ranged from \"from Ravi Shankar to flamenco\" with a lot of jazz somewhere in between. At the age of eight, Sawhney bought his first Miles Davis album. He progressed quickly on the piano, whipping through all the grades. \"I was never really focused on the classical side of just playing what was in front of me.I was much more interested in oral forms, that is to say those that are not written down.\" Music, he says, is about gradually exposing what's in the air around the musician. \"That's why I'm very sensitive of what's around me when I'm writing and playing music.\" He still retains vivid memories of his grammar school in Rochester, Kent, where he was the only Asian pupil out of 700 children. Every school day between the ages of 11 and 13 he would be attacked when he walked through the gates in the morning. At the time - the late 1970s - the National Front was active in Rochester, he says. A music teacher would ban him from the piano practice room, where he liked to improvise, on the spurious grounds that he had \"no sheet music\" with him. If he heard the man's footsteps approaching, Sawhney would slip from what he was playing into some convincing-sounding music such as Mozart or Bach, and the steps would move away. But his music was an escape from the daily racism. He would get home and play, three hours on the guitar and three on the piano. Playing as an end in itself, though, wasn't so important to him. \"I guess that's what made me a composer in the end. For me music was much more about escapism. Music is an incredible catharsis if you are lonely.\"",

      "bodyText": "Once again the shortlist for the Carnegie Medal closely follows books picked out in the Guardian's Young Fiction Award, including our winner Jacqueline Wilson. A feature of the Carnegie is the \"shadowing\" of the national judging by thousands of children. If your school would like to take part, see the Library Association's website for more details. Kit's Wilderness David Almond (11+, Hodder Children's Books, \u00a34.99). Almond draws the reader into a dark, multi-layered novel through the character of Kit, who becomes involved with the troubled John Askew and a strange game down a deserted coal pit. Set in the north-east's mining country in winter, the book explores the darkest corners of the mind, and deals with big themes - death, exclusion, the supernatural. A very moving tale. Little Soldier Bernard Ashley (12+, Orchard Books, \u00a34.99) Kaninda is a refugee from an African war in which he joined the rebel army. Brought by aid workers to England, he finds a different kind of warfare on London's streets. Through wonderful, subtle characterisation, Ashley shows aspects of British culture through the eyes of an outsider, and it's not a pretty sight. Postcards from No Man's Land Aidan Chambers (14+, Bodley Head, \u00a310.99, offer price \u00a38.99 + 99p p+p) Rich and complex, this novel weaves together the story of a second world war soldier with that of his grandson and namesake, Jacob, who is visiting Amsterdam for the commemoration of the Battle of Arnhem 50 years later. Every word is well chosen with perfect timing and pace in a sophisticated book for older teenagers. King of Shadows Susan Cooper (10+, Bodley Head, \u00a310.99, offer price \u00a38.99 + 99p p+p) A powerful, time slip story which cleverly parallels the lives of two young actors in the 20th and 16th centuries. Nat comes to terms with his father's death only when he is transported to the past and befriended by William Shakespeare himself. Tightrope Gillian Cross (12+, OUP, \u00a35.99) A thriller about an inner-city ganglord and a quiet, independent girl who dares to challenge him. A tense read with excellent characterisation and intriguing commentary by different characters at the end of each chapter. The Rinaldi Ring Jenny Nimmo (11+, Mammoth, \u00a34.99). A beautiful story about a boy coming to terms with his mother's death and how the past impinges on the present. Nimmo creates a subtle mix of family relationships and fantasy as Eliot encounters a ghost in his room whose fiancee dies as a result of the first world war. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban J K Rowling (8+, Bloomsbury, \u00a35.99) A potent, magical mix of adventures, strong characters, sparkling dialogue and witty one-liners. Universal themes and social issues are set in a make-believe world firmly rooted in reality, and we follow Harry as he continues his journey of self-discovery. The Illustrated Mum Jacqueline Wilson (10+, Doubleday, \u00a33.99). An emotional and compassionate novel about two sisters coping with a manic depressive mother. Wilson strikes a remarkable balance between darkness and humour; characterisation is strong, dialogue sharp and structure masterful. Written, often very movingly, from the child's point of viewpoint.",

Richard Humphreys, a Quaker philanthropist, had opened the first black college in 1837 - 26 years before the end of slavery - to train free black teachers. </p> <p>It was this effort that inspired her, other individuals, both black and white, and state governors to start establishing such schools in the mid-1860s, shortly after emancipation. </p> <p>By 1902, there were 85 black colleges and universities, and until 1954, when the US supreme court ended \"separate and equal\" schools, they were the most likely option for black college hopefuls. </p> <p>Among the graduates are Martin Luther King, the civil rights leader, Toni Morrison, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for literature, 50% of all black lawyers, 50% of black engineers and 85% of black physicians. </p> <p>Unlike their ancestors, today's black students can attend any US university if they meet the entry requirements. So why, then, are black colleges and universities still around, attracting almost 20% of African American university students? Haven't they served their purpose? </p> <p>Dr Claude Perkins, dean of the school of education at Albany State University in Georgia, a black college with about 3,400 students, says it is because \"there are false barriers that still limit access for black people and other minorities to a quality education\". This is especially prevalent in the more prestigious schools such as Harvard and Yale. </p> <p>So black colleges need to prepare for a long haul. The face of America might have changed, but underneath there are race-related problems in education that have yet to be tackled. Even successful black colleges are still having to make their case for separate state funding - a few years ago, state of Georgia officials considered eliminating some of its black colleges by merging them with integrated schools. </p> <p>This would have meant the end for Albany State, but the black community, anxious to avoid job losses and demotions - the fate of many black educators when integration in schools was rolled out in the 1960s - successfully protested against the merger. </p> <p>The colleges argue that, if they did not exist, many black students would be denied a place in school due to their standardised test scores. Research done by FairTest, the National Centre for Fair and Open Testing, shows that the scholastic aptitude test used for entry into most US institutions is racially and culturally biased. The results often suggest that minority students are inferior learners. </p> <p>Monty Neill, director of FairTest, challenges this notion. He advocates dropping standardised tests because they draw on knowledge of cultural activities, which is rare in urban, rural and ethnic communities. Rural and inner-city students are unfamiliar with many of the terms. For example, when asked to define the term \"regatta\" for the SAT, only 22% of the black students answered correctly against 53% of their white peers. </p> <p>While most black colleges require the SAT, they sometimes accept lower marks if students excel in internal exams. Also, excellent high-school grades weigh heavily. The schools have been criticised for this, with some people suggesting the colleges are nursing poor students and issuing fraudulent degrees. </p> <p>Perkins disagrees. \"It is impossible to adequately determine the abilities of a person through a standardised test,\" he says. \"You must look at their potential and willingness to accomplish objectives.\" </p> <p>Another reason black colleges are critical is that they continue to reiterate black pride. Not only do they promote the achievements of black authors, historians, and leaders through their core curriculum, but they also celebrate black culture through sports, the arts and humanities. </p> <p>More significantly, black colleges provide a non-threatening learning environment for students, offering opportunities that some might have missed, such as the chance to be editor of the newspaper, captain of the debate team or president of the student body. </p> <p>Many black college graduates who attended predominantly white high schools attribute their first opportunity to compete in a non-racist environment to their university experience. </p> <p>Even so, not everyone thinks black colleges should continue. Some believe they have run their course, and that they perpetuate black extremism. Perkins, however, believes these schools are still a major force in educating black students. Although they constitute only 3% of the country's institutions of higher learning, 28% of all blacks who receive bachelors degrees get them there. \"If you look at the record of higher education in this country, you will see that an extremely high percentage of students going on to integrated graduate school are from black colleges and universities too.\" </p> <p>As for black extremism, Perkins dismisses this. He says these schools neither practise discrimination nor have they ever barred the entrance of non-black students or taught hate. Consequently, more and more whites are attending black schools. Albany State's enrolment is 14.6% white. \"Students who attend black colleges are doing more than getting a degree,\" said Perkins. \"Through nurturing relationships, they are preparing to deal with life and become great citizens.\" </p> <p>Although some of these black colleges have funding and other problems, they should be accepted as part of US society and judged as individual entities like other US universities. Some, such as Spelman and Morehouse Colleges and Howard University, remain as much a force as the well-known schools, at least in the black community. </p> <p>Such institutions might not be the answer to race-related problems in higher education in England, but Perkins warns that any nation wanting to excel \"must have goals to improve people's life chances. And the best way is through access to quality education.\" </p> <p><strong>The facts</strong></p> <p>Black colleges and universities exist in 14 southern states, six northern states, three midwestern states, one western state, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. They are two- and four-year institutions, including graduate and professional schools. Over 50 are private and the rest are state schools. They enrol more than 370,000 students - more than 13% of them are white, 1.5% are Hispanic, 3.5% are non-resident aliens, and a small percentage are Asian, American Indian and Alaskan.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nafeo.org/inst/binst.htm\">National Institution for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.uncf.org/\">United Negro College Fund</a></p>",

And the best way is through access to quality education.\" The facts Black colleges and universities exist in 14 southern states, six northern states, three midwestern states, one western state, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands. They are two- and four-year institutions, including graduate and professional schools. Over 50 are private and the rest are state schools. They enrol more than 370,000 students - more than 13% of them are white, 1.5% are Hispanic, 3.5% are non-resident aliens, and a small percentage are Asian, American Indian and Alaskan.

The Federation clearly resembles the Japanese, suggesting a stereotypically uniform management system.\" </p> <p>Hollywood's contribution to the debate is worth a PhD or two with films like Bladerunner, Alien, Robocop, Brazil and Total Recall. But TV, too, with Dr Who and Star Trek, has also helped define human relationships with new technologies and ideas. But sci-fi doesn't just have a reflective role, it is also predictive.

A range of summer courses offers intensive study of Greek and Latin at all levels, and supplements this with lectures on most aspects of ancient civilisation.</p> <p>The Joint Association of Classical Teachers organises four predominantly residential courses. One, at Kingswood School in Bath, specialises in Latin. Another, at Bryanston School in Dorset, teaches Greek. A third, at Durham School, offers both languages, and a fourth, at Repton in Derbyshire, devotes itself to classical civilisation. </p> <p>Teachers and lecturers are drawn from schools, universities and museums. Most students are between 15 and 25. Many are studying one or both of the ancient languages and relish the opportunity to meet other classicists and immerse themselves in unfamiliar authors and texts. Many are preparing for intensive programmes at university, and gain their first experience of often complex languages under the guidance of expert tutors. </p> <p>A highlight of the Latin course is a lecture on the city's complex of Roman baths, followed by an evening tour of the site. Students at Bryanston rehearse a tragedy, learn their parts in the original language and put on a performance in the school's own Greek theatre. </p> <p>A residential course at Lampeter teaches Latin and Greek to a rather different group of people. The influx of mature students into the university system has had a particularly marked impact on classics departments. The Lampeter summer school is not just for older students, but it might just be the place for anyone who wants to concentrate on the subject in hand rather than being sidetracked into campus social life. </p> <p>For those living in London or Birmingham, non-residential study is a possibility. The Rowley Regis Summer School is a special programme for students in the Sandwell area. Local state schools send along their most enthusiastic linguists to gain a first taste of Latin and Greek, and those who are hooked receive tuition in before- and after-school classes throughout the following year. </p> <p>Without the dedication of one tireless classics teacher, Myles Walker, and the loyalty of a team of former pupils who come back to teach, it would be impossible. </p> <p>The London Summer School in classics, which this year celebrates its 25th anniversary, offers four hours of language classes and a lecture every day. Students are drawn from schools across London, and the course is hosted by University College's department of classics.

Students at Bryanston rehearse a tragedy, learn their parts in the original language and put on a performance in the school's own Greek theatre. A residential course at Lampeter teaches Latin and Greek to a rather different group of people. The influx of mature students into the university system has had a particularly marked impact on classics departments. The Lampeter summer school is not just for older students, but it might just be the place for anyone who wants to concentrate on the subject in hand rather than being sidetracked into campus social life. For those living in London or Birmingham, non-residential study is a possibility. The Rowley Regis Summer School is a special programme for students in the Sandwell area. Local state schools send along their most enthusiastic linguists to gain a first taste of Latin and Greek, and those who are hooked receive tuition in before- and after-school classes throughout the following year. Without the dedication of one tireless classics teacher, Myles Walker, and the loyalty of a team of former pupils who come back to teach, it would be impossible. The London Summer School in classics, which this year celebrates its 25th anniversary, offers four hours of language classes and a lecture every day. Students are drawn from schools across London, and the course is hosted by University College's department of classics. A special festive programme is promised this year. So are you frustrated by the lack of classics in your area? Or just desperate for more? Come to summer school! \u0095 JACT Latin Summer School, Kingswood School, Bath, July 31-August 10.

Blunkett has threatened to resign if 80% of 11-year-olds fail to reach the expected standard in literacy for their age by 2002, and 75% achieve the same level in numeracy.</p> <p>The tests, originally devised and introduced under the Tories by the then education secretary Kenneth Baker, have been embraced and continued with unbridled enthusiasm by the Labour government. This month marks the sixth consecutive year that all 7-, 11- and 14-year-olds will take the national curriculum tests. In the massive exercise overseen by the government's Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, around 600,000 pupils will take the tests at each key stage. In total, around 1.8m pupils are involved, with around 7.2m scripts marked across key stages 2 and 3. </p> <p><strong> Age 4 and 5: Baseline Assessment</strong></p> <p> <strong> What is it?</strong> </p> <p> The government's view is that baseline assessment is not a test, but rather an essential evaluation to test a child's basic skills when he or she first sets foot in the classroom, to help teachers plan effectively for individual learning needs. The assessment also helps schools to measure and monitor children's progress from the time they start school. This lets them check whether children are achieving as well as they should as they move through school. </p> <p> <strong> What does it cover?</strong> </p> <p> Schools can choose from different schemes approved by the QCA. But all include language and literacy, mathematics and personal and social development. </p> <p> <strong> When does it take place?</strong> </p> <p> Usually when children join reception class at the age of four or five, and within seven weeks of starting school. </p> <p> <strong> How are children assessed?</strong> </p> <p> Schools will normally make the assessment seem like part of an everyday classroom activity (such as looking at a book with a child). So children may not even be aware that they are being assessed. </p> <p> <strong> What will school tell parents?</strong> </p> <p> Schools will arrange to discuss children's progress with parents during their first term. The assessment helps teachers decide if your child has a particular learning need and, if so, more detailed discussion will take place. </p> <p> <strong> How can parents help?</strong> </p> <p> Don't be tempted to \"coach\" your children as this will only provide a snapshot of what has been learned most recently. The following steps should help to ensure your child has a good start at school: </p> <p>Talk with them and discuss their questions; encourage them to concentrate on activities for more than a few moments; read and talk about books, and encourage them to look at books by themselves; introduce them to as many new words as possible; help them count and use numbers in everyday situations. </p> <p><strong> Age 7, 11 and 14: National curriculum tests</strong></p> <p> These tests are designed to provide a snapshot of attainment at the end of each key stage (ie, 7-year-olds at key stage 1, 11-year-olds at key stage 2 and 14-year-olds at key stage 3). Each child's results will be reported to parents alongside on-going assessment made by teachers as a measure of their progress. The tests are related directly to the content of the national curriculum, so no \"trick questions\" are included. Tests are designed to show how well your child is doing in different areas of a subject on a particular day. Teacher assessment, by contrast, judges your child's performance in the whole subject over time. </p> <p> <strong> When do they take place?</strong> </p> <p> Key stage 1 tests can take place any time in May, while key stage 2 tests must be taken between this Friday (14 May) and next Thursday (18 May). Key stage 3 tests take place from yesterday (8 May) to 15 May. </p> <p> <strong> What is included in the tests?</strong> </p> <p> For 7-year-olds: children are tested in English (reading, spelling and writing including handwriting) and maths. In reading, most children are tested both on their ability to read aloud and on their understanding of what they have read. The tests are short. Children will probably spend less than three hours on them, spread over several days to fit in with other schoolwork. </p> <p>For 11-year-olds: children are tested on English (reading, writing, spelling and handwiring), maths (with and without a calculator and mental arithmetic) and science. The tests are more like short exams, sat on a certain day, lasting about five hours over one week. </p> <p>For 14-year-olds: children are tested on English (reading, writing including spelling and handwriting and a scene from a Shakespeare play), maths (with and without a calculator and mental arithmetic) and science. Most 14-year-olds will spend between seven and eight hours on the tests. </p> <p> <strong> Who marks the tests?</strong> </p> <p> Class teachers mark the key stage 1 tests, but the other two stages are marked by externally-recruited examiners approved by the QCA. </p> <p> <strong> How do parents get children's results?</strong> </p> <p> The results of the tests and teacher assessment are in the form of a level on the national curriculum scale. They are reported to parents by the end of the summer term. But the timing of key stage 2 tests makes it impossible for them to be used for secondary school selection, which is largely complete before the tests are taken. Some of the tests for 7- and 11-year-olds will also give scores related to age, which schools may pass on to parents. These tell you how your child is doing compared with other children born in the same month. </p> <p> <strong> Can the results be challenged?</strong> </p> <p> If a school is unhappy with the external marking and believes it has been done incorrectly, it can request a review which may lead to changes. If as a parent you are unhappy about the level awarded to your child, you can also request a review. This could lead to the mark and the level being changed. </p> <p> <strong> How can I help my child prepare for the tests?</strong> </p> <p> Assuming you have made sure your child has kept up with his or her homework and any school preparation for the tests, you can help your child by ensuring he or she gets a good night's sleep beforehand, has a good breakfast and is not up at the crack of dawn doing a paper round! </p> <p><strong> In the pipeline Age 9 and 13 </strong></p> <p> The government is to introduce so-called \"world-class tests\" late next year, after being piloted in around 50 selected schools. The tests are designed to select gifted and talented children and will be strictly optional. Pupils aged nine and 13 will tackle questions in maths and problems-solving which are pitched at the level of the brightest 15% of children in the world. Teachers and parents will be encouraged to put suitably bright youngsters forward for the tests, which will be taken on computers. </p> <p><strong> Age 12 and 13: </strong></p> <p> Ministers have recently underlined their concern about the \"dip\" between years seven and eight when pupils are adjusting to the transition between primary and secondary school and often have a tendency to go \"backwards\". Schools will be given the chance to offer optional tests to 12- and 13-year-olds as a useful staging post on the way to key stage 3. The tests are likely to be introduced for year seven pupils in the summer term next year and the following year for pupils in year eight.</p> <p><strong>Further information</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk\">Department of Education and Employment</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.nc.uk.net\">National curriculum</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.qca.org.uk\">QCA</a></p>",

In reading, most children are tested both on their ability to read aloud and on their understanding of what they have read. The tests are short. Children will probably spend less than three hours on them, spread over several days to fit in with other schoolwork. For 11-year-olds: children are tested on English (reading, writing, spelling and handwiring), maths (with and without a calculator and mental arithmetic) and science. The tests are more like short exams, sat on a certain day, lasting about five hours over one week. For 14-year-olds: children are tested on English (reading, writing including spelling and handwriting and a scene from a Shakespeare play), maths (with and without a calculator and mental arithmetic) and science. Most 14-year-olds will spend between seven and eight hours on the tests. Who marks the tests? Class teachers mark the key stage 1 tests, but the other two stages are marked by externally-recruited examiners approved by the QCA. How do parents get children's results? The results of the tests and teacher assessment are in the form of a level on the national curriculum scale. They are reported to parents by the end of the summer term. But the timing of key stage 2 tests makes it impossible for them to be used for secondary school selection, which is largely complete before the tests are taken. Some of the tests for 7- and 11-year-olds will also give scores related to age, which schools may pass on to parents. These tell you how your child is doing compared with other children born in the same month. Can the results be challenged? If a school is unhappy with the external marking and believes it has been done incorrectly, it can request a review which may lead to changes. If as a parent you are unhappy about the level awarded to your child, you can also request a review. This could lead to the mark and the level being changed. How can I help my child prepare for the tests? Assuming you have made sure your child has kept up with his or her homework and any school preparation for the tests, you can help your child by ensuring he or she gets a good night's sleep beforehand, has a good breakfast and is not up at the crack of dawn doing a paper round! In the pipeline Age 9 and 13 The government is to introduce so-called \"world-class tests\" late next year, after being piloted in around 50 selected schools. The tests are designed to select gifted and talented children and will be strictly optional. Pupils aged nine and 13 will tackle questions in maths and problems-solving which are pitched at the level of the brightest 15% of children in the world. Teachers and parents will be encouraged to put suitably bright youngsters forward for the tests, which will be taken on computers. Age 12 and 13: Ministers have recently underlined their concern about the \"dip\" between years seven and eight when pupils are adjusting to the transition between primary and secondary school and often have a tendency to go \"backwards\". Schools will be given the chance to offer optional tests to 12- and 13-year-olds as a useful staging post on the way to key stage 3. The tests are likely to be introduced for year seven pupils in the summer term next year and the following year for pupils in year eight.
