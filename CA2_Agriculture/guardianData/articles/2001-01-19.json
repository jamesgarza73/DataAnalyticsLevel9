Although there is some confusion about the legal basis of Flintshire's intervention it is known that they used the Children Act 1989.

All other interested parties, including Richard and Vickie Allen - the US couple who also \"bought\" the twins - and the birth mother Tranda Wecker, can be represented at this hearing. The minimum duration of the care order is 28 days, after which the council has to re-apply to the courts. The UK government: At prime minister's question time yesterday, Tony Blair disclosed that the government planned to press ahead with new adoption laws in the current parliamentary session. Legislation has been in place since 1999 that could prevent a repeat of the Kilshaw affair, but the prime minister admitted that regulations enforcing this law will not come into force until \"later this year\". But the list of Commons business for the coming two weeks unveiled yesterday makes no mention of any adoption legislation. The Arkansas authorities: The Kilshaws could face a legal battle in the state whose liberal adoption laws they used to adopt internet twins Belinda and Kimberly. An Arkansas judge says legal action is likely, and that it could invalidate the Kilshaws' claim to the children. Judge Ellen Brantley said: \"From what I have read about this case, it makes me uncomfortable on a number of different levels, professionally as well as personally.\" Tranda Wecker: The twins' birth mother says she wants her children back, but could face prosecution for perjury if she seeks to do so through the Arkansas courts.

I'm astonished that they took them.\" Mrs Kilshaw's 18-year-old daughter Cayley, from a previous relationship, was seen running through the hotel in tears. Before the babies' removal from the Kilshaws, their birth mother had told ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald programme: \"I feel that the Kilshaws need to come back to the United States to settle this adoption. She added: \"If the social services put them in foster care, then everybody loses.\" Asked whether she wanted the twins back, Ms Wecker replied: \"Financially, I cannot give them the world but I love my girls.\" A US family lawyer yesterday said the babies must be returned to America so their future could be decided in the courts.",

      "bodyText": "The story of the \"internet twins\" is an extreme example of the risks of unregulated adoption. It provides quite a salutary lesson to those MPs, and even some government ministers, who bemoan the rigour with which prospective adopters are assessed in the UK and compare it unfavourably with adoption in other countries, particularly the US. Indeed, Matthew Engel in the Guardian last year was highly critical of the home study processes applied to his own application to adopt from overseas and described the civilised process in the US as a \"brief discussion over carrot cake and coffee\". It is of course true that there are 52 states in the US, each with its own adoption laws and procedures. Some states have procedures very similar to those in the UK, but there are others where adoption would appear to be merely a formality with very background information about the applicants, sometimes not verified (faxed criminal record checks can be acceptable for example) and few restrictions on the \"expenses\" paid to the parties involved in the adoption (these can be incurred by the birth mother, the agency or \"broker\" and the lawyer). The internet sites which encourage applications to such \"brokers\" are little more than shopping malls where you can trawl through a stream of seductive pictures of small children and fill in boxes to state your preferences - including the age, ethnicity and gender of the child and also asking to exclude all problems you do not want to cope with - for example \"attachment problems\", which are of course an issue to a greater or lesser extent for most children who have no secure families of their own. Costs on such sites are often explicit and guaranteed, differing according to the ethnicity and complexity of the child. It is hardly a surprise that such sites and potential lack of \"intrusive\" home study inquiries will attract some unsuitable adopters as well as people with paedophile tendencies - as child protection procedures improve and access to working with children becomes more highly regulated, such opportunities will inevitably be fully exploited. It is precisely the reason that parliament passed last year the Adoption (International Aspects) Act which will allow Britain to ratify the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption - although it is yet to be implemented, it is to be hoped the delay in achieving this will now be addressed as a result of this current example which has caused such serious concern. The US, however, have not yet ratified the Hague Convention, which is hardly surprising as adoption in participating countries has to be carried out by a not-for-profit accredited body - this clearly was not the position in the case of the internet twins. The convention also requires the country in which adopters are \"habitually resident\" to \"prepare a report including information about their identity, eligibility and suitability to adopt, background, family and medical history, social environment, reasons for adoption, ability to undertake an inter-country adoption as well as the characteristics of the children for whom they will be qualified to care\". Again the Welsh adopters in the twins' case admit they had no such official report and were not required to do so by the US. The inevitable question which must now be asked is why Britain continues to have reciprocal agreements with the US, given the enormous variety in the standards of procedures between different States, many of which would not be acceptable in the UK. Central to all our concerns must be the welfare of vulnerable children who find themselves caught up in any unregulated system of family finding and placement. The potential for unscrupulous, damaging or dangerous practice is all too real. Considerable efforts have been made both in the UK and in the international community in establishing a watertight framework that prevents the exploitation of children needing new families. It is of concern in the current case that significant loopholes have been exposed in the international adoption of children from the US. It is incumbent on the UK authorities to close these loopholes with the enactment of the Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1999 and regulations. It also important that urgent discussions take place with US authorities to ensure that their procedures do not expose vulnerable children to the tragedy and trauma that as been clearly evident this week.",

After Labour landed its three \u00a32m cheques from equally wholesome donors, he sought an interview and told Mr Hague right away: \"I'd like to give \u00a35m.\" By now he has perfected the line: \"I want nothing for myself, nothing for the company, I would reject a peerage.\" All he wants is a prime minister who will \"not be interested in spin, the latest focus group or what the opinion polls say\".</p> <p>A simmering dislike of Labour surfaces here. He dislikes Tony Blair's smile (\"not his fault\") and his political correctness. But he recoils from any suggestion that Gordon Brown's or Jack Straw's gambling review might take revenge by taxing spread betting winnings. \"That would be deplorable, but I don't think they'd do it.\" Labour might put spread betting under a single gambling regulator, but he would not lose any sleep over it.</p> <p>He may still be worth \u00a385m, but he does not live in grand style and IG's headquarters is in \u00a312 per sq ft Southwark, not just across the Thames in the City. \"Yes, I'm an Old Etonian, but I'm also a self-made man.\"</p>",

I said I'd contribute if I floated my company.\" Up to that point he had never given more than \u00a350 to his party. Last year he gave \u00a330,000, plus \u00a31,000 to the Vauxhall Tories. After Labour landed its three \u00a32m cheques from equally wholesome donors, he sought an interview and told Mr Hague right away: \"I'd like to give \u00a35m.\" By now he has perfected the line: \"I want nothing for myself, nothing for the company, I would reject a peerage.\" All he wants is a prime minister who will \"not be interested in spin, the latest focus group or what the opinion polls say\". A simmering dislike of Labour surfaces here. He dislikes Tony Blair's smile (\"not his fault\") and his political correctness. But he recoils from any suggestion that Gordon Brown's or Jack Straw's gambling review might take revenge by taxing spread betting winnings. \"That would be deplorable, but I don't think they'd do it.\" Labour might put spread betting under a single gambling regulator, but he would not lose any sleep over it. He may still be worth \u00a385m, but he does not live in grand style and IG's headquarters is in \u00a312 per sq ft Southwark, not just across the Thames in the City. \"Yes, I'm an Old Etonian, but I'm also a self-made man.\"",

      "bodyText": "The former chancellor Kenneth Clarke last night criticised William Hague's bandwagon-jumping tendency as he warned that the Tories would have to sharpen domestic policies to have a chance of winning the next election. He insisted in a speech to the centre-left Tory Reform Group that the party would win over an \"undecided and disillusioned\" public only if it \"really engaged\" them on the key issues of the economy, health and education - not just on negative campaigning. \"We must say what compassionate conservatism means and say what we stand for as forcefully as we say what we are against,\" Mr Clarke told the meeting in London. As he criticised Mr Hague - who defeated him in his bid to be party leader in 1997 - the Tory leader signaled that he would fight the coming election closer to the centre ground. Mr Hague yesterday promoted Michael Portillo and Francis Maude, his two most \"inclusive\" shadow colleagues, to key positions at the campaign's heart. He sidelined their more divisive rivals, Ann Widdecombe and defence spokesman Iain Duncan Smith, to \"barnstorming\" roles touring the country. Tory officials were at pains yesterday to stress the importance Mr Hague attached to regional campaigning. He plans to do plenty outside the \"M25 beltway\" himself. But when he is absent from party HQ the Portillo-Maude axis will field media questions on policy matters. Mr Clarke, now a back-bencher, will have no central role, though many Tory MPs still believe that a Hague election catastrophe could catapult him into the leadership. The former chancellor stressed the Tories must not offer tax cuts at the expense of public services. \"Conservatives always aim for lower taxation,\" he said. \"But we must promise only to cut taxes if and when economic growth has been achieved and the key public services have been properly financed.\" That is coded criticism of Mr Hague who has been trying to promise both tax cuts, spending cuts and better services. But, while he insisted the NHS required extra resoures, he argued higher spending was not in itself enough - and the Tories should advocate reform of hospital bureaucracy. On education, Mr Clarke - a former education secretary - praised his party's \"free school\" policy designed to devolve power to headteachers He argued his party had \"the makings of policies which could give the slogan of compassionate conservatism some meaning and substance\", and insisted this \"positive approach\" could \"win more votes than the cleverest day to day criticism of whatever Labour mistakes happen to hit the newspapers\".",

      "body": "<p>An intricate and ambitious portrait of Britain at the end of a second-term Labour government has been drawn up by ministers and civil servants over the past six months. It covers every aspect of government, ranging from asylum policy and the extent to which inequality will be reduced, to the birthweight of newborn babies.</p> <p>In what will be seen as Labour's hidden manifesto for the general election, the government has set out more than 200 targets, backed in the last few weeks by a growing number of comprehensive agreements on how the targets are to be defined and delivered.</p> <p>Critics claim the preciseness of the targets will prove to be a big hostage to fortune. The furore over Labour's failure so far to meet two of its five election pledges underlines the political pitfalls of making measurable promises. Most of the targets are due to be met by 2004 or 2005, the likely date Labour will go to the polls seeking a third term.</p> <p><b> Health </b><br></p> <p><b> Heart disease:</b> Cut deaths from 69,000 in 1997 to 51,500 by 2005.</p> <p><b> Cancer:</b> Reduce deaths by 69,000 to 61,000 in 2005.</p> <p><b> Suicides:</b> Cut from 4,500 in 1997 to 4,000 in 2005.</p> <p><b> Outpatients: </b> By 2005, all appointments will be prebooked.</p> <p><b> Waiting lists:</b> By the end of 2005, maximum waiting time for outpatient appointments down to three months and for inpatient treatment to six months. Figures for third quarter of last year show 25% of patients are still waiting more than three months for an outpatient appointment and more than six months for inpatients.</p> <p><b> Community care:</b> As many as 130,000 elderly people people to be helped in the community, rather than hospital.</p> <p><b> Crime </b><br></p> <p><b> Vehicle crime: </b> Reduction of 30% by 2004 from the baseline of 1998-9. Will need cut from 1,071,000 to around 700,000.</p> <p><b> Burglary:</b> Cut of 28% by 2005 from baseline of 464,000. Latest figures show burglaries at 417,400.</p> <p><b> Robbery:</b> By 2005 robbery of personal and business property in London to be cut by 15% from 1999-2000 figures. Cut of 34.1% by 2004 in West Midlands; by 20% by 2005 in Greater Manchester; 15% by 2004 in Merseyside; 21.4% by 2004 in West Yorkshire. Robbery in England's big cities would fall by 14%.</p> <p><b> Fear of crime:</b> By 2004, should be lower than levels to be recorded in the British Crime Survey in 2001.</p> <p><b> Cost of crime:</b> A target, yet to be agreed, will be issued. The figure is currently estimated at \u00a360bn.</p> <p><b> Charges:</b> By 2002, the number of recorded crimes brought to justice would be increased from the 1998-9 figure of 1,202,037 crimes cleared up out of 5,109,110.</p> <p><b> Reoffending:</b> Cut of 5% against the predicted rate by 2004; 30,000 offenders to complete accredited programmes and the number of prisoners getting jobs to double.</p> <p><b> Asylum </b><br></p> <p>By March 2004, 75% of asylum applicants will be decided within 61 days. The number of removals will rise from 7,850 in 1999-2000 to 37,000 in 2003-4.</p> <p><b> Education </b><br></p> <p><b> Key stage 2:</b> By 2002, 80% of children taking English to achieve level 4; 75% taking maths to achieve level 4. David Blunkett, the education secretary, has already promised to resign if these targets are not met. September 2000 figures showed 75% had reached level 4 in English, up 4% on the previous year, and 72% had reached maths level 4 - up 3%. Figures in 1996 were 52% English, 54% maths. New targets will be set for 2004. No local education authority should have an, as yet unfixed, percentage of pupils failing to reach the new target.</p> <p><b> Key stage 3:</b> By 2004, 80% should achieve level 5 or above in maths; 75% in English and IT; and 70% in science. Figures in September 2000 showed 65% reaching the level in maths (up 3%), 63% in English (down 1%) and 59% in science (up 4%). At least 65% of pupils in each education authority to reach this target in English and maths.</p> <p><b> GCSE:</b> By 2004, 92% of pupils to obtain five or more GCSEs at grades A to G. In the 500 worst performing schools, 75% should obtain five or more GCSEs at A to C. The current figure in these schools is 18%.</p> <p><b> Truancy:</b> A reduction of 10% by an unfixed date on the level achieved in 2002.</p> <p><b> Adult literacy:</b> By 2004, the number of adults who have literacy or numeracy problems should be cut by 750,000.</p> <p><b> Childcare:</b> A million extra places by March 2004.</p> <p><b> Ofsted:</b> Half of schools should have been inspected between April 2001 and March 2004; 500 schools to be monitored because they are lower attaining or in an education action zone. Thirty local education authorities to be inspected every year. Ten special reports, including secondary schools and the usefulness of targets for 14-year-olds.</p> <p><b> Children and poverty </b><br></p> <p><b> Child protection:</b> By 2004, proportion of children aged 0-3 in 500 sure start areas who are re-registered on the child protection register within 12 months should fall by 20%. The measure is designed to see if emotional and social support is improving. No baseline has been established.</p> <p><b> Smoking:</b> The number of mothers who smoke during pregnancy in sure start areas to fall by 10%. Baseline to be established in December 2002.</p> <p><b> Speech therapy:</b> By 2004 number of children aged 0-3 with speech and language problems requiring specialist intervention will have fallen by 5 points. Baseline to be ready by December 2002.

      "bodyText": "An intricate and ambitious portrait of Britain at the end of a second-term Labour government has been drawn up by ministers and civil servants over the past six months. It covers every aspect of government, ranging from asylum policy and the extent to which inequality will be reduced, to the birthweight of newborn babies. In what will be seen as Labour's hidden manifesto for the general election, the government has set out more than 200 targets, backed in the last few weeks by a growing number of comprehensive agreements on how the targets are to be defined and delivered. Critics claim the preciseness of the targets will prove to be a big hostage to fortune. The furore over Labour's failure so far to meet two of its five election pledges underlines the political pitfalls of making measurable promises. Most of the targets are due to be met by 2004 or 2005, the likely date Labour will go to the polls seeking a third term. Health Heart disease: Cut deaths from 69,000 in 1997 to 51,500 by 2005. Cancer: Reduce deaths by 69,000 to 61,000 in 2005. Suicides: Cut from 4,500 in 1997 to 4,000 in 2005. Outpatients: By 2005, all appointments will be prebooked. Waiting lists: By the end of 2005, maximum waiting time for outpatient appointments down to three months and for inpatient treatment to six months. Figures for third quarter of last year show 25% of patients are still waiting more than three months for an outpatient appointment and more than six months for inpatients. Community care: As many as 130,000 elderly people people to be helped in the community, rather than hospital. Crime Vehicle crime: Reduction of 30% by 2004 from the baseline of 1998-9. Will need cut from 1,071,000 to around 700,000. Burglary: Cut of 28% by 2005 from baseline of 464,000. Latest figures show burglaries at 417,400. Robbery: By 2005 robbery of personal and business property in London to be cut by 15% from 1999-2000 figures. Cut of 34.1% by 2004 in West Midlands; by 20% by 2005 in Greater Manchester; 15% by 2004 in Merseyside; 21.4% by 2004 in West Yorkshire. Robbery in England's big cities would fall by 14%. Fear of crime: By 2004, should be lower than levels to be recorded in the British Crime Survey in 2001. Cost of crime: A target, yet to be agreed, will be issued. The figure is currently estimated at \u00a360bn. Charges: By 2002, the number of recorded crimes brought to justice would be increased from the 1998-9 figure of 1,202,037 crimes cleared up out of 5,109,110. Reoffending: Cut of 5% against the predicted rate by 2004; 30,000 offenders to complete accredited programmes and the number of prisoners getting jobs to double. Asylum By March 2004, 75% of asylum applicants will be decided within 61 days. The number of removals will rise from 7,850 in 1999-2000 to 37,000 in 2003-4. Education Key stage 2: By 2002, 80% of children taking English to achieve level 4; 75% taking maths to achieve level 4. David Blunkett, the education secretary, has already promised to resign if these targets are not met. September 2000 figures showed 75% had reached level 4 in English, up 4% on the previous year, and 72% had reached maths level 4 - up 3%. Figures in 1996 were 52% English, 54% maths. New targets will be set for 2004. No local education authority should have an, as yet unfixed, percentage of pupils failing to reach the new target. Key stage 3: By 2004, 80% should achieve level 5 or above in maths; 75% in English and IT; and 70% in science. Figures in September 2000 showed 65% reaching the level in maths (up 3%), 63% in English (down 1%) and 59% in science (up 4%). At least 65% of pupils in each education authority to reach this target in English and maths. GCSE: By 2004, 92% of pupils to obtain five or more GCSEs at grades A to G. In the 500 worst performing schools, 75% should obtain five or more GCSEs at A to C. The current figure in these schools is 18%. Truancy: A reduction of 10% by an unfixed date on the level achieved in 2002. Adult literacy: By 2004, the number of adults who have literacy or numeracy problems should be cut by 750,000. Childcare: A million extra places by March 2004. Ofsted: Half of schools should have been inspected between April 2001 and March 2004; 500 schools to be monitored because they are lower attaining or in an education action zone. Thirty local education authorities to be inspected every year. Ten special reports, including secondary schools and the usefulness of targets for 14-year-olds. Children and poverty Child protection: By 2004, proportion of children aged 0-3 in 500 sure start areas who are re-registered on the child protection register within 12 months should fall by 20%. The measure is designed to see if emotional and social support is improving. No baseline has been established. Smoking: The number of mothers who smoke during pregnancy in sure start areas to fall by 10%. Baseline to be established in December 2002. Speech therapy: By 2004 number of children aged 0-3 with speech and language problems requiring specialist intervention will have fallen by 5 points. Baseline to be ready by December 2002. Target also to be prepared for the use of libraries by parents in sure start areas. Unemployment: By 2004, fewer children aged 0-3 in sure start areas will live in households where no one is working. Childminders: By 2002 a national register should be established and in the following year daycare providers to be inspected annually. Welfare Children: Number of children in low- income households to be reduced by a quarter by 2004. Households with incomes 60% or below the median to be covered. Baseline is 4.2m children in low-income households after housing costs and 3.1m before housing costs.Reform child support scheme for new cases by April 2002 so by the next year the accuracy rate for assessments and reviews is not less than 90%, with payment arrangements established on average within six weeks. The level of compliance should be at least 75%. Pensions: Reform second tier by 2004 so stakeholder pensions give more people access to good value funded second pensions. Access will be measured by surveys. Two million carers and 2m disabled people with broken work records have for the first time started to build up a second-tier pension. Fourteen million low and moderate earners have started to build up a better second-tier pension than would be possible under the old state earnings-related pension. Low and moderate earners are defined as anyone earning between \u00a33,432 and \u00a321,600. Benefits: By 2005 85% of claimants should have their benefits paid into bank accounts. The figure in October 2000 was 33%. Fraud and error in income support and jobseekers allowance should be reduced by 25% by March 2004. The baseline is \u00a31.38bn fraud and error in September 1998. Care: By March 2004, anyone leaving care should be 75% as well off in terms of jobs and skills as other 19-year-olds in local authority areas. Adoption: By 2004-5 the number of looked-after children adopted will be increased by 40% from the 2,700 in 1999-2000. Acute care: By the end of 2004, the cost of acute care commissioned will have fallen to the level of the currently cheapest and best-performing trusts. Jobs and the economy Employment: Over the cycle, increase employment, defined as seasonally adjusted International Labour Organisation employment figure. A baseline will be set in spring 2001. The cycle is judged to have started in mid-1999. The number of children in households with no one in work to be reduced. A baseline will be set in spring 2001 and progress monitored every six months Over the three years the relative employment rates of disadvantaged areas and groups should be increased taking account of the economic cycle. The pledge is aimed at people with disabilities, lone parents, ethnic minorities and the over-50s, as well the 30 local authority districts with the poorest initial labour market position. The baseline is spring 2001. The 30 districts are Hackney, Islington, Newham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets in London; City of Glasgow, Dundee, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire in Scotland; Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath, Pembrokeshire and Rhondda in Wales; Easington, Halton, Hartlepool, Hull, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, Salford, South Tyneside, Sunderland. Environment and transport Air quality: Improvement should be made against seven indicators between 2003 and 2008 with a baseline of 1998. By 2010 reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% from 1990 levels and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2010. Emissions in 2000 were already 13.5% below 1990 levels. With existing policies, UK emissions will be 15% below 1990 levels in 2010 and emissions of CO2 8.5% lower. Household waste: By 2004, 17% to be recycled or composted. Energy efficiency: Improvement in energy efficiency by 2004 in 600,000 homes so no more than 10% of household income is spent on fuel. Social housing: Between 2001 and 2004 the number of households living in social housing that does not meet decency standards should be cut by a third. Current estimate is that 29% of housing is not is in a decent state, with 43% in the 841 most deprived wards. Establish a new target for bringing abandoned houses back into use. By April 2002 reduce the number of people sleeping rough by two-thirds compared with June 1998 when 1,850 slept rough. Roads and rail: The government has still not established targets or a system of measurement for the reduction of traffic congestion in cities and trunk roads. Rail use should be increased by half by 2010, measured in passenger kilometres, at the same time as improvements in punctuality and reliability. The first milestone will be to increase mileage by 15% by 2001-2 compared with the 1999-2000 figure of 38.3bn passenger kms. The latest quarter showed mileage rose by 38.4 passenger kms. Buses: Bus use should rise by 10% from the 1999 level of 3.736 million passenger journeys. London Underground : Journey times should be cut, but no targets set. Countryside: By 2005 open up public access. By 2010 bring into favourable condition 95% of nationally important wildlife sites compared with the current 60% of sites.

By 2004 brownfield land will be reclaimed at a rate of over 1,100 hectares a year, with the result that 17% of brownfield land will be reclaimed by 2010. Last May ministers estimated that 57.710 hectares of British land was undeveloped. Local government: All local councils to have a new constitution by June 2002. Fire and traffic deaths: Cut number of people killed or seriously injured in accidents by 40% compared with the average for 1994-8, when 47,656 were killed or injured. By 2004-5 reduce by 15% the days lost from work-related ill-health or injury per 100,000 workers. As a result 3.5m fewer working days will be lost because of work-related ill-health or injury. By March 2004 reduce by 10% the number of building fires from a base line of 1998-9. By March 2004 annual accidental fire- related deaths will fall to 303 from the current 379.

Offending: By 2005, reduce the level of offending twice or more a month among crack- or heroin-using offenders aged over 17 by 25% by 2005 and by 50% by 2008. No baseline exists, but estimates suggest the target will apply to 15% of all people arrested. Treatment: Increase the participation of problem drug users in drug treatment programmes by 55% by 2004, by 66% by 2005, and by 100% by 2008. No baseline exists. Reduce the availability of class A drugs by 25% by 2005 and by 50% by 2008. Criminal justice Criminal courts: By 2004 reduce the time from charge to disposal of all defendants, first by dealing with 80% of youth court cases within their time targets.

      "body": "<p>I have done so much this week that it's going to be difficult to fit it all in, but I'll try. </p> <p> Saturday was my last day in Singapore and I crammed in as much as possible. First it was off to Sentosa Island. Theme parks aren't really my scene, but I wanted to go on the cable car ride from Mount Faber to the Island which gave an aerial view over Singapore. I walked the neat nature trail halfway round the island, then took the monorail - with the inevitable synchonised commentary - round the rest. This was enough and I caught the ferry back. Off then to Jurong bird park which was enjoyable, with flocks of pink flamingos and aviaries of brightly coloured forest birds, although I didn't relish seeing huge eagles and a condor in cages, however big. I had my first taste of magueritas out of jam jars with Dan that evening - powerful stuff. </p> <p> On Sunday I flew to Kuching in Sarawak to be met by Steven, my son's girlfriend's uncle. Steven, Jennifer (his wife) and their four children have been the most wonderful hosts, helping to plan trips for me, ferrying me about, and giving me a real taste of Malay life and food. Noodles with meat and soup for breakfast took a bit of getting used to but I managed it as well as many of the local Chinese dishes with unfamiliar ingredients. Playing Monopoly with the streets of Kuala Lumpur on the board was also interesting. </p> <p> Kuching is a lovely city with a delightful riverwalk adorned with coloured fountains and flower beds. We took a 'tambang' - a little ferry - across and down the river. Across the road is a line of shops stuffed with Borneo artifacts. The city is full of Chinese and Malay food markets with fruit and vegetables I have never seen before. I visited some of the excellent museums although unfortunately the unique Cat Museum was shut on the day I was wandering about. </p> <p> On Tuesday it was off for an overnight stay at the Bako National Park. A real adventure. Accessible only by boat, I was somewhat taken aback to be given a life jacket. There followed a 20 minute ride crashing through high waves with sea horses on them, and being drenched by spray. Exciting stuff! The park was beautiful, with stunning empty beaches, the forest at times meeting the sea. This is what I had come for. I chose a trail of five kilometres or so that looked manageable and set off. Within minutes I was deep in the rainforest, drenched with sweat, completely alone (except for Bruce, of course) splashing through streams and clambering over tree roots. The only sound was the continuous hum and whine of insect life. I was lost in wonder, feeling like Dr Livingstone, Margaret Mead and Harrison Ford all in one. OK, the trails were marked and there were wooden planks across swampy bits, but it still felt totally real and raw. When I reached high points the views took my breath away. The only problem was that I had drunk half my water by the time I was only a quarter of the way and had to begin rationing it. In the deepest part of the forest it was so dense that it became dark. Water dripped everywhere and the rocks and trees were covered in thick moss. Here even the insects stopped their noise. I have never experienced such complete silence, felt so close to ancient nature at its richest, or so far from civilisation. I will never forget that feeling. Late afternoon I was rewarded by the sight of proboscis monkeys swinging high in the trees. Magic. Dirty, drenched to the skin, tired and a little dehydrated, I arrived back at the lodge after six of the best hours of my life. </p> <p> That evening there was a terrific thunderstorm with torrential rain. I sheltered in the canteen spending a pleasant evening talking to a couple from Cairns in Australia. I returned to the lodge to find my bag of rolls empty, despite meshed windows and a locked door, I can only guess that a very tiny macaque monkey had squeezed through the narrow slats above the windows, neatly untied the plastic bag and enjoyed my breakfast. The next morning for the first time, I met an English couple who had actually seen the Netjetters website back in England. It felt exciting and strange, especially as there were only about half a dozen tourists in total at the park! After a short walk in the morning, spotting more monkeys, and another hair-raising boat ride, it was back to Kuching. </p> <p> The following day I was off again - this time to the heritage park where they have rebuilt examples of the different tribal longhouses, which are fast disappearing from East Malaysia. People from the different tribes were cooking or weaving or making musical instruments in the traditional ways. Although it was manufactured, the combination of the setting and the enthusiasm with which the people demonstrated what they were doing made the experience fascinating and informative. I had a go with a blowpipe but missed the target. With a tennis racquet it would have been different. Later there was a show of the different tribal music and dancing, which was excellent. </p> <p> Steven had promised me 'an experience ' that evening and we went off to a Chinese 'trance' session. Certain people are chosen to house the spirits in trance and their homes are turned into small Chinese temples. I was shown all the statues of the many gods in alcoves around the temple and we waited an hour while people gradually gathered, lighting hundreds of eye-watering incense sticks as they came, and preparing offerings of fruit for the gods. It was the elephant god that was to enter the young man in a trance that night, so offerings of bananas and milk were made. Then there was a session of smashing coconuts on the ground while you made a wish for your luck to change, and finally the man entered the trance. He began shaking and then making elephant noises which the band of followers crowded round him tried to interpret. He then slowly forced a large steel hook right through his cheek and out of his mouth, which he left there for about 20 minutes. When the spirit finally left he collapsed, and they had to try to revive him and find out which god had now entered him. On finding out, they dressed him in the appropriate robes and he sat on a chair of sharp nails with his feet resting on blades. He now blessed amulets and people asked him for help with problems. We then left. I really don't know what to make of it all. I saw the hook go in and come out without a mark. Steven had also made me feel the nails through the chair seat before it started. I will just leave it there for you as a description of an experience. </p> <p> So this is my last day in Kuching. Tomorrow I am off to Sibu and on to Miri and the Gunung Mulu National Park and then across to Kuala Lumpur and the peninsular. I do not know how to thank the Phua family, Steven, Jennifer and the lovely children Ceasar, Cheryl, Ben and Daryl, (who now all call me Aunty Sue) for making my stay here so wonderful. I can only hope that one day they will come to stay in England so I can return their hospitality. My schedule next week is very tight - journeys were difficult to book because of the Chinese new year when everyone travels to visit their families. I will endeavour to find myself in an internet caf\u00e9 next Friday but it may be difficult in the remoter regions of north Sarawak so there is a chance it may be late. All my weeks have been varied and exciting but this one maybe most of all. If this keeps up I'll be in experience overload. I can only hope that I am managing to convey a taste of my wonderful time to you.</p>",

I will endeavour to find myself in an internet caf\u00e9 next Friday but it may be difficult in the remoter regions of north Sarawak so there is a chance it may be late. All my weeks have been varied and exciting but this one maybe most of all. If this keeps up I'll be in experience overload. I can only hope that I am managing to convey a taste of my wonderful time to you.",

That is intended as a compliment. I sat through this recording of Poul Ruders's adaptation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale in something like shock, a screw turning in the pit of my stomach. That alone is testament to the work's terrorising impact. It's also, I think, what we are meant to feel when we hear the opera, or read the book. The inevitable question is why? What is it about The Handmaid's Tale that makes it such a uniquely distressing experience? </p> <p>Atwood's 1985 novel is a grimly dystopian prophecy that envisions a totalitarian society based on fundamentalist religious principals. Christian revolutionaries have taken over the US, renaming it the Republic of Gilead, overriding its democracy and enforcing codified biblical laws on sexual conduct. All fertile women who have expressed what is perceived as trangressive desire are brainwashed into becoming Handmaids - surrogate mothers to elite childless couples, their babies conceived during ritual Ceremonies in which husbands (called Commanders) have sex with the Handmaids in the presence of their wives. </p> <p>What pushes the book into territory way beyond polemic and really hits raw nerves, however, is Atwood's emphasis on the collusion of some women in the oppression of others, and on the dire similarities between the languages of right-wing reaction and radical sexual politics. During the Ceremony, the Handmaid is held down by the wife. So-called Aunts emotionally batter women into submission and preside over the communal execution of offenders. The Handmaids are \"only containers, walking wombs\", who may not arouse desire. \"To be seen is to be penetrated,\" shrieks the fanatical Aunt Lydia, steering perilously close to the radical feminist perspective that equates male desire with rape.</p> <p> The novel charts the thoughts of one Handmaid, Offred (named after the Commander whose property she is), as she begins both to find her voice and identity in opposition to the regime, and gradually to recall the murder of her husband and her separation from her daughter during the revolution. Atwood's cliff-hanging finale offers little way out of the nightmare beyond the eventual collapse of Gilead over time, and it's not surprising that when Hollywood filmed the novel in 1989, a redemptive ending was tacked on. Ruders and his librettist, Paul Bentley, offer us no such hope. </p> <p>The opera's genius lies in Ruders's ability to find a sound world that mirrors the novel's oppressive tone. The strictures of tonality and minimalism are broadly equated with totalitiarian suppression, while atonality is aligned with individuality - but emotional dissonance is rarely absent for long, and the cumulative impression is of an impending eruption that never happens. </p> <p>The effects are crushing, forcing us to share Offred's experience. Pulverising percussion pins the listener down. Obsessively repeated phrases sting like the cattle prods the Aunts use to persecute their victims. Amazing Grace threads its way through the score like some wonky Bach chorale, combining with ejaculatory glockenspiel trickles to form an obscene accompaniment to the Ceremonies. The whole is relentless. Only once, at the work's climax, does Ruders let the pace slacken. He uses not one, but two singers for the principal character, representing Offred the Handmaid and the woman she was in \"the Time Before\". As memories obliterate the Aunts' conditioning, the two women join in a duet of Monteverdian simplicity as they mourn the loss of Offred's child. Horror suddenly finds release in grief, and the effect is devastating. </p> <p>The casting of both roles is telling. Marianne Rorholm, very much a singing actress, is the Handmaid, her voice clotting throughout with exhaustion and anguish. Hanne Fischer, voluptuous in tone, is the sensual, emotionally fulfilled woman she once was. Her lovers are two contrasting tenors. Poul Elming, virile and athletic, is the husband who exists in her memory, while Gert Henning-Jensen, elegant and lyrical, plays Nick, the Guard she comes to desire in the present. The late, much-missed Aage Haugland is a slimy, hypocritical Commander, with Susanne Resmark as his possessive, Gospel-singing wife. Anne Margarethe Dahl voices Aunt Lydia's stratospheric vituperation with sickening vividness. In the pit Michael Schonwandt astounds, as always. </p> <p>The recording was made during the premiere run in Ruders's native Denmark last March, and there is a considerable amount of stage clatter, though you can live with it. Curiously, however, a bit of the piece is missing. Taking his cue from Atwood, Bentley frames the opera with a narration, delivered after the fall of Gilead by a lecturer presenting the tapes on which the Handmaid tells her tale. The spoken sections have been cut, which is a pity, since the sound of a woman's voice stuttering into song after male speech must have been overwhelming in the theatre. You need to hear this, if you think your nerves can take it - but you must prepare to be disturbed and very, very afraid if you do.</p>",

      "body": "<p>An intricate and ambitious portrait of Britain at the end of a second-term Labour government has been drawn up by ministers and civil servants over the past six months. It covers every aspect of government, ranging from asylum policy and the extent to which inequality will be reduced, to the birthweight of newborn babies.</p> <p>In what will be seen as Labour's hidden manifesto for the general election, the government has set out more than 200 targets, backed in the last few weeks by a growing number of comprehensive agreements on how the targets are to be defined and delivered.</p> <p>Critics claim the preciseness of the targets will prove to be a big hostage to fortune. The furore over Labour's failure so far to meet two of its five election pledges underlines the political pitfalls of making measurable promises.

The level of compliance should be at least 75%.</p> <p><b> Pensions:</b> Reform second tier by 2004 so stakeholder pensions give more people access to good value funded second pensions. Access will be measured by surveys.</p> <p>Two million carers and 2m disabled people with broken work records have for the first time started to build up a second-tier pension. Fourteen million low and moderate earners have started to build up a better second-tier pension than would be possible under the old state earnings-related pension. Low and moderate earners are defined as anyone earning between \u00a33,432 and \u00a321,600.</p> <p><b> Benefits:</b> By 2005 85% of claimants should have their benefits paid into bank accounts.

It covers every aspect of government, ranging from asylum policy and the extent to which inequality will be reduced, to the birthweight of newborn babies. In what will be seen as Labour's hidden manifesto for the general election, the government has set out more than 200 targets, backed in the last few weeks by a growing number of comprehensive agreements on how the targets are to be defined and delivered. Critics claim the preciseness of the targets will prove to be a big hostage to fortune. The furore over Labour's failure so far to meet two of its five election pledges underlines the political pitfalls of making measurable promises. Most of the targets are due to be met by 2004 or 2005, the likely date Labour will go to the polls seeking a third term. Health Heart disease: Cut deaths from 69,000 in 1997 to 51,500 by 2005. Cancer: Reduce deaths by 69,000 to 61,000 in 2005. Suicides: Cut from 4,500 in 1997 to 4,000 in 2005. Outpatients: By 2005, all appointments will be prebooked. Waiting lists: By the end of 2005, maximum waiting time for outpatient appointments down to three months and for inpatient treatment to six months. Figures for third quarter of last year show 25% of patients are still waiting more than three months for an outpatient appointment and more than six months for inpatients. Community care: As many as 130,000 elderly people people to be helped in the community, rather than hospital. Crime Vehicle crime: Reduction of 30% by 2004 from the baseline of 1998-9. Will need cut from 1,071,000 to around 700,000. Burglary: Cut of 28% by 2005 from baseline of 464,000. Latest figures show burglaries at 417,400. Robbery: By 2005 robbery of personal and business property in London to be cut by 15% from 1999-2000 figures. Cut of 34.1% by 2004 in West Midlands; by 20% by 2005 in Greater Manchester; 15% by 2004 in Merseyside; 21.4% by 2004 in West Yorkshire. Robbery in England's big cities would fall by 14%. Fear of crime: By 2004, should be lower than levels to be recorded in the British Crime Survey in 2001. Cost of crime: A target, yet to be agreed, will be issued. The figure is currently estimated at \u00a360bn. Charges: By 2002, the number of recorded crimes brought to justice would be increased from the 1998-9 figure of 1,202,037 crimes cleared up out of 5,109,110. Reoffending: Cut of 5% against the predicted rate by 2004; 30,000 offenders to complete accredited programmes and the number of prisoners getting jobs to double. Asylum By March 2004, 75% of asylum applicants will be decided within 61 days. The number of removals will rise from 7,850 in 1999-2000 to 37,000 in 2003-4. Education Key stage 2: By 2002, 80% of children taking English to achieve level 4; 75% taking maths to achieve level 4. David Blunkett, the education secretary, has already promised to resign if these targets are not met. September 2000 figures showed 75% had reached level 4 in English, up 4% on the previous year, and 72% had reached maths level 4 - up 3%. Figures in 1996 were 52% English, 54% maths. New targets will be set for 2004. No local education authority should have an, as yet unfixed, percentage of pupils failing to reach the new target. Key stage 3: By 2004, 80% should achieve level 5 or above in maths; 75% in English and IT; and 70% in science. Figures in September 2000 showed 65% reaching the level in maths (up 3%), 63% in English (down 1%) and 59% in science (up 4%). At least 65% of pupils in each education authority to reach this target in English and maths. GCSE: By 2004, 92% of pupils to obtain five or more GCSEs at grades A to G. In the 500 worst performing schools, 75% should obtain five or more GCSEs at A to C. The current figure in these schools is 18%. Truancy: A reduction of 10% by an unfixed date on the level achieved in 2002. Adult literacy: By 2004, the number of adults who have literacy or numeracy problems should be cut by 750,000. Childcare: A million extra places by March 2004. Ofsted: Half of schools should have been inspected between April 2001 and March 2004; 500 schools to be monitored because they are lower attaining or in an education action zone. Thirty local education authorities to be inspected every year. Ten special reports, including secondary schools and the usefulness of targets for 14-year-olds. Children and poverty Child protection: By 2004, proportion of children aged 0-3 in 500 sure start areas who are re-registered on the child protection register within 12 months should fall by 20%. The measure is designed to see if emotional and social support is improving. No baseline has been established. Smoking: The number of mothers who smoke during pregnancy in sure start areas to fall by 10%. Baseline to be established in December 2002. Speech therapy: By 2004 number of children aged 0-3 with speech and language problems requiring specialist intervention will have fallen by 5 points. Baseline to be ready by December 2002. Target also to be prepared for the use of libraries by parents in sure start areas. Unemployment: By 2004, fewer children aged 0-3 in sure start areas will live in households where no one is working. Childminders: By 2002 a national register should be established and in the following year daycare providers to be inspected annually. Welfare Children: Number of children in low- income households to be reduced by a quarter by 2004. Households with incomes 60% or below the median to be covered. Baseline is 4.2m children in low-income households after housing costs and 3.1m before housing costs.Reform child support scheme for new cases by April 2002 so by the next year the accuracy rate for assessments and reviews is not less than 90%, with payment arrangements established on average within six weeks. The level of compliance should be at least 75%. Pensions: Reform second tier by 2004 so stakeholder pensions give more people access to good value funded second pensions. Access will be measured by surveys. Two million carers and 2m disabled people with broken work records have for the first time started to build up a second-tier pension. Fourteen million low and moderate earners have started to build up a better second-tier pension than would be possible under the old state earnings-related pension. Low and moderate earners are defined as anyone earning between \u00a33,432 and \u00a321,600. Benefits: By 2005 85% of claimants should have their benefits paid into bank accounts. The figure in October 2000 was 33%. Fraud and error in income support and jobseekers allowance should be reduced by 25% by March 2004. The baseline is \u00a31.38bn fraud and error in September 1998. Care: By March 2004, anyone leaving care should be 75% as well off in terms of jobs and skills as other 19-year-olds in local authority areas. Adoption: By 2004-5 the number of looked-after children adopted will be increased by 40% from the 2,700 in 1999-2000. Acute care: By the end of 2004, the cost of acute care commissioned will have fallen to the level of the currently cheapest and best-performing trusts. Jobs and the economy Employment: Over the cycle, increase employment, defined as seasonally adjusted International Labour Organisation employment figure. A baseline will be set in spring 2001. The cycle is judged to have started in mid-1999. The number of children in households with no one in work to be reduced. A baseline will be set in spring 2001 and progress monitored every six months Over the three years the relative employment rates of disadvantaged areas and groups should be increased taking account of the economic cycle. The pledge is aimed at people with disabilities, lone parents, ethnic minorities and the over-50s, as well the 30 local authority districts with the poorest initial labour market position. The baseline is spring 2001. The 30 districts are Hackney, Islington, Newham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets in London; City of Glasgow, Dundee, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire in Scotland; Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath, Pembrokeshire and Rhondda in Wales; Easington, Halton, Hartlepool, Hull, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, Salford, South Tyneside, Sunderland. Environment and transport Air quality: Improvement should be made against seven indicators between 2003 and 2008 with a baseline of 1998. By 2010 reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% from 1990 levels and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2010. Emissions in 2000 were already 13.5% below 1990 levels. With existing policies, UK emissions will be 15% below 1990 levels in 2010 and emissions of CO2 8.5% lower. Household waste: By 2004, 17% to be recycled or composted. Energy efficiency: Improvement in energy efficiency by 2004 in 600,000 homes so no more than 10% of household income is spent on fuel. Social housing: Between 2001 and 2004 the number of households living in social housing that does not meet decency standards should be cut by a third. Current estimate is that 29% of housing is not is in a decent state, with 43% in the 841 most deprived wards. Establish a new target for bringing abandoned houses back into use.

By 2003 obtain 5% of UK electricity from renewable sources. Drugs Usage: Reduce the proportion of people aged 16-24 reporting the use of class A drugs in the last month by 25% by 2005, suggesting drug use will fall in the age group from 8.3% to 6.2%. Offending: By 2005, reduce the level of offending twice or more a month among crack- or heroin-using offenders aged over 17 by 25% by 2005 and by 50% by 2008. No baseline exists, but estimates suggest the target will apply to 15% of all people arrested. Treatment: Increase the participation of problem drug users in drug treatment programmes by 55% by 2004, by 66% by 2005, and by 100% by 2008. No baseline exists. Reduce the availability of class A drugs by 25% by 2005 and by 50% by 2008.

      "bodyText": "One of Britain's most senior ethnic minority officers was suspended from duty yesterday over a host of allegations, including that he had attempted to pervert the course of justice. Ali Dizaei, a superintendent with the Metropolitan police, was one of the force's most vocal internal critics and legal adviser to the National Black Police Association. Last night a black member of an independent advisory group told the Guardian that he had refused a request from the Met last year to review the investigation because the allegations he was told of were trivial. Scotland Yard said Mr Dizaei had been suspended pending an inquiry into \"a significant number of counts of misconduct\". In a statement the force said: \"This follows information received relating to a range of alleged disciplinary and criminal issues that cover matters of dishonesty, attempting to pervert the course of justice, personal misconduct and integrity.\" It refused to give more details but the investigation surrounding Mr Dizaei had run for more than six months under tight secrecy and involved intrusive surveillance. Only four people in the Met had known of the complex operation: the Met's commissioner Sir John Stevens, his deputy Ian Blair, assistant commissioner Mike Todd and the officer heading the investigation. Mr Dizaei, who is based at Kensington and Chelsea station, was summoned yesterday morning to Cannon Row station. There Mr Todd handed him a 163 disciplinary notice detailing the allegations and ordered him to hand over his warrant card. A Scotland Yard source said: \"We are fully aware of Ali Dizaei's position and profile. We would not have taken the action we did today without reasonable grounds.\" The investigation will be supervised by the police complaints authority. Mr Dizaei, 37, whose father and grandfather were senior police chiefs in Iran, had been fast-tracked for promotion since joining the Met two years ago from the Thames Valley force. He was due to take a strategic command course in April which could have led to his reaching the rank of assistant chief constable or above. Today Mr Dizaei was to have stood for the chairmanship of the National Black Police Association, who yesterday stressed their full support for their suspended member. A senior Met source said: \"This is the biggest challenge the force has faced in the post-Macpherson era.\" Scotland Yard is still reeling from the Stephen Lawrence scandal, where institutional racism was found to have ham pered the investigation into the black teenager's murder. Mindful of continued serious questions over its record on race, the force asked selected members of the Metropolitan police authority and its independent advisory group to review the investigation of Mr Dizaei to try to neutralise any claim that he had been victimised. But Ben Bowling, a member of the independent advisory group and a law lecturer, said: \"I was approached over six months ago to become involved in the investigation and declined. \"The officer mentioned some of the allegations to me and asked: 'Is this something to do with the culture, how people from his background behave, or something we need to look into more deeply?' \"The officer said there was concern that Mr Dizaei had been seen at a social gathering in a restaurant off duty in his police uniform, and this seemed unusual for a senior police officer. \"The kinds of allegations that were raised at that time by the police officer who approached me did not appear to me to be substantial enough to justify a covert investigation, including intrusive surveillance, of the nature that was being proposed.\" Among black and Asian police officers, there was disbelief at the suspension. Ravi Chand, chairman of the National Black Police Association, said: \"He was very high profile in a number of areas and had always been seen as a person of integrity. If the Met gets this wrong, it will be disastrous. It will be a serious dent in their relations with the black community and black staff.\" For the Met, the suspension of Mr Dizaei opens a potentially dangerous chapter, following the case of Gurpal Virdi. He was an Asian officer sacked for sending racist hatemail, to whom the Met had to pay \u00a3150,000 after it was found by an employment tribunal to have treated him in an unfair and discriminatory manner. Last night Mr Virdi told the Guardian: \"The tendency in the Met, if you speak out, is that you either get suspended or you get accused of some sort of crime. \"The Met can't investigate allegations against black or Asian officers properly. I have no faith in them.\" Mr Dizaei was one of eight Asian and black officers of superintendent rank or above out of a total of 1,407 in England and Wales. He was a controversial figure who last year accused the police service of the \"ethnic cleansing\" of black and Asian candidates for promotion through \"culturally biased\" testing procedures. The Iranian-born law gradu ate recently criticised the home secretary, Jack Straw, for reinstating a PC who called a teenager a \"black bastard\". Police were also investigating attacks on Mr Dizaei's car. A senior officer who was a former colleague of Mr Dizaei's at the Thames Valley force said: \"I liked him, but he made enemies because of his direct style. \"If he thought you were talking rubbish, he would tell you. \"He thinks differently to other police officers and is challenging to have around. He's bright but managerially he had a mixed reputation.\"",

The week's delay could give Letsbuyit some badly needed breathing space. Letsbuyit was given protection from creditors at the end of December and the court appointed legal firm Van Doom as trustees. But this week the trustees, opposed by Letsbuyit's management, filed for bankruptcy.",

And only recently have their outfits been liberated from the Benny Hill fantasy of white vests and pleated knicker-flashing skirts, allowing them to play with colours, styles and shapes to become less overtly sexual and more assertively individual.

Anna Kournikova, radiating neon yellow, could have come from Luella's 80s pop club, and the asymmetry of Hingis's lopsided sleeves has the messed-up air of Jean Paul Gaultier's much praised tough-chic look.

On American Vogue, sprinter Marion Jones is the covergirl, also shrouding her muscles in Calvin Klein. Both magazines seem to signal that, with the current lapse in big-name stars, athletes may become the fashion world's next talent pool to tap. </p> <p>As the outfits increasingly steal the limelight, sportswear labels attempt to out-shock each other. \"I think tennis clothing companies are trying to get more bold in what they are getting the girls to wear,\" says defending Australian Open champion Lindsay Davenport, who is wearing the same Nike print as Pierce, but on her skirt rather than as a top. \"Some maybe go extreme to get some recognition for the company.\" Indeed, Melbourne is acting as a handy catwalk substitute for the label's spring/ summer ranges, providing massive worldwide publicity for clothing that will go on sale over the coming month. </p> <p>But some of those playing, like Davenport, are keeping a certain distance from the fashion circus.

Two days later, they were put back up again - but this time in the office's inner courtyard.</p> <p>Just after Christmas, as the deadline for registraton loomed, the asylum issue received an unusual burst of publicity, when 19 statues of the baby Jesus were removed from mangers across the country after a spectacular mass \"kidnapping\" designed to dramatise the plight of latter-day refugees.</p> <p>\"How would Jesus, fleeing persecution in his homeland, have been received in Belgium in the year 2000?\" asked the activists behind the stunt in a message posted on their website.</p> <p>\"These peaceful 'kidnappings' are the work of citizens \u0085 who want to alert public opinion to the reception in Belgium of refugees from around the world.\"</p> <p>The statues were later returned, unharmed, to their mangers.</p> <p>Belgium officials repeatedly complain that the number of illegal aliens entering the country has become unmanageable and say they want EU-wide policies to share the burden.</p> <p>Not suprisingly, this will be a high priority for prime minister Guy Verhofstadt when he takes over the EU's rotating presidency in July.</p> <p>In recent years, there have been a series of widely reported incidents, including the forced deportation of Slovak gypsies and the death of a Nigerian woman, while being restrained by police during deportation back to Africa.</p> <p>\"Sans-papiers\" - scores of thousands of foreigners without ID papers - are part of the landscape. Begging is rife.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, extremist groups like the Flanders-based Vlaams Blok have turned immigration into a hot political issue - just as it has become in Austria, Italy and France.</p> <p>Across the EU, nearly 250,000 people applied for asylum last year, though many countries have taken steps to stem the influx.</p> <p>Most are eventually rejected because governments say the refugees are looking for better economic conditions, not fleeing genuine political persecution.</p> <p>Critics of Belgian policies complained this week that the federal ministries of the interior and social affairs had abandoned responsibility to voluntary organisations, while refugee reception centres failed to coordinate the despatch of asylum seekers to government offices, thus leaving them - literally - out in the cold.</p> <p>\"Foreign TV stations were on hand to show the world how Belgium receives - or rather mistreats - asylum seekers,\" observed Le Soir commentator Martine Vandemeulbroucke.</p> <p>\"But seeing so much chaos and incompetence, one has the painful impression that that is exactly what was intended.\"</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eu\">European integration</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/EMU/\">Economic and monetary union</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eurocommission/\">European commission</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/europarl/\">European parliament</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28ian+black%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=ian+black&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Ian Black</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.europa.eu.int/index-en.htm\" target=\"_new\">EUROPA (European government home page)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.lesoir.be/\" target=\"_new\">Le Soir</a><br><a href=\"http://spjelkavik.priv.no/henning/ifi/schengen/\" target=\"_new\">Schengen convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.elis.rug.ac.be/ELISgroups/speech/msr/\" target=\"_new\">MSR: Belgian news</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dhnet.be/\" target=\"_new\">DH Net</a><br><a href=\"http://belgium.fgov.be/\" target=\"_new\">Belgian government</a></p>",

The result is that asylum claims have tripled from the usual number for this time of year despite the temporary re-introduction of border controls - normally removed under the EU's Schengen lesgislation. Outside Belgium, this story has attracted little attention. But it is another vivid illustration of a massive, Europe-wide phenomenon of people from poor or oppressive societies across the globe seeking a better life in the heart of a wealthy and democratic continent. Belgium, with a population of around 10m, received over 40,000 asylum applications in the last year alone, the highest number per capita of any of the EU's 15 countries. Europe-wide, numbers will certainly get bigger - probably much bigger - when the union starts taking in new members in a few years time and the frontier between Poland and Russia, and between Poland and Ukraine, form its external border. Existing problems such as people-trafficking, drug smuggling and other forms of organised crime are also expected to become even more difficult. Last year's horrific incident, when 58 Chinese suffocated to death in a Dover-bound lorry that crossed the channel from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge, tragically illustrated the hazards that open borders and lax controls can bring. The queues on the Boulevard Simon Bolivar are because of the government's decision to end cash benefits for asylumseekers waiting for their cases to be decided. Aid for a single adult of 20,000 Belgian francs (\u00a3320) a month will be replaced by assistance in the form of food, housing and other social services. Volunteers from Medecins Sans Frontieres and the Red Cross have been on hand at the Aliens Office dispensing welcome cups of hot soup and coffee to keep off the winter chill. But an unseemly row broke out when the Brussels city council ordered the tents removed. Two days later, they were put back up again - but this time in the office's inner courtyard. Just after Christmas, as the deadline for registraton loomed, the asylum issue received an unusual burst of publicity, when 19 statues of the baby Jesus were removed from mangers across the country after a spectacular mass \"kidnapping\" designed to dramatise the plight of latter-day refugees. \"How would Jesus, fleeing persecution in his homeland, have been received in Belgium in the year 2000?\" asked the activists behind the stunt in a message posted on their website. \"These peaceful 'kidnappings' are the work of citizens \u0085 who want to alert public opinion to the reception in Belgium of refugees from around the world.\" The statues were later returned, unharmed, to their mangers. Belgium officials repeatedly complain that the number of illegal aliens entering the country has become unmanageable and say they want EU-wide policies to share the burden. Not suprisingly, this will be a high priority for prime minister Guy Verhofstadt when he takes over the EU's rotating presidency in July. In recent years, there have been a series of widely reported incidents, including the forced deportation of Slovak gypsies and the death of a Nigerian woman, while being restrained by police during deportation back to Africa. \"Sans-papiers\" - scores of thousands of foreigners without ID papers - are part of the landscape. Begging is rife. Unsurprisingly, extremist groups like the Flanders-based Vlaams Blok have turned immigration into a hot political issue - just as it has become in Austria, Italy and France. Across the EU, nearly 250,000 people applied for asylum last year, though many countries have taken steps to stem the influx. Most are eventually rejected because governments say the refugees are looking for better economic conditions, not fleeing genuine political persecution. Critics of Belgian policies complained this week that the federal ministries of the interior and social affairs had abandoned responsibility to voluntary organisations, while refugee reception centres failed to coordinate the despatch of asylum seekers to government offices, thus leaving them - literally - out in the cold. \"Foreign TV stations were on hand to show the world how Belgium receives - or rather mistreats - asylum seekers,\" observed Le Soir commentator Martine Vandemeulbroucke. \"But seeing so much chaos and incompetence, one has the painful impression that that is exactly what was intended.\" Email ian.black@theguardian.com Related special reports European integration Economic and monetary union European commission European parliament Other articles More articles by Ian Black Useful links EUROPA (European government home page) Le Soir Schengen convention MSR: Belgian news DH Net Belgian government",

In a statement, Mr McGreevy said: \"The twins are safe and well in the council's care.\"</p> <p>He called last night's action a \"careful, considered and proportionate response\" to the situation and said that the council had obtained the protection order from a magistrate of the Flintshire Family Proceedings Court.

This has ripped my family apart,\" she said.</p> <p>Her solicitor husband Alan added: \"We don't feel too good this morning, but, having said that, we feel determined to fight on with this case. I think, at the end of the day, right will prevail.\"</p> <p>\"I think the social services had a bloody cheek,\" Ms Kilshaw added. \"They came in with no clothes and no dummies for them.\"</p> <p>Ms Kilshaw said that she was \"personally hurt\" by the comments of friends and neighbours, and told how she had grown close to the twins since she and her husband had brought them to Britain on a visitors' visa.</p> <p>\"I couldn't have given them more if I'd given birth to them myself. I am public enemy number one and Alan public enemy number two, but people haven't seen us together as a family.</p> <p>\"They are trying to say we are not right people.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Californian couple Richard and Vickie Allen, who claim they were duped into handing back the twins after caring for them for two months and paying an adoption broker a reported \u00a34,000, repeated their offer of \"a good home\" for the twins.</p> <p>Ms Allen said, from California, that she sympathised with the Kilshaws after last night's events, adding: \"My heart goes out to them and it does make me upset.</p> <p>\"I've got nothing against them and I can understand the pain they must be feeling having the children taken away from them.\"</p> <p>The twins' natural mother, Tranda Wecker, 28, said yesterday that she wanted the children back.</p> <p>In another move, a senior Arkansas adoption judge told BBC Radio 5 Live that there was likely to be legal action in the state courts over the case, which could render the twins' adoption invalid.</p> <p>Judge Ellen Brantley, who is believed to have been in contact with social workers in Wales to provide them with details of the case, also denounced the selling of babies as \"disgusting\", and described many of those involved in the current case as \"villains\".</p> <p>\"The big issue is that the children, if they are to be adopted, are adopted by parents who can give them a loving and stable home,\" she said. \"That ought to be regardless of the monetary amounts that anybody is able to provide,\" she said.</p> <p>Many Americans choose to adopt under the Arkansas legal system, because of its relaxed rules, which allow adoption within just 10 days.</p> <p>But parents who give children up for adoption must live in Arkansas for at least 30 days, and there have been suggestions that the twins' biological mother might not have fulfilled the residence qualification, invalidating the adoption.</p> <p>The Californian baby broker at the heart of the scandal, Tina Johnson, meanwhile insisted that her Caring Heart agency was a legitimate \"adoption facilitation\" business.</p> <p>Her spokeswoman, Jennifer Coburn, told a news conference: \"Caring Heart does not sell, trade or engage in the trafficking of babies. This is illegal and is not what is happening in this case.\"</p> <p>The agency specialised in African-American and mixed-race children, and charged a non-refundable fee for Ms Johnson's expenses and time, she said. She did not disclose the amount.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,424815,00.html\">18.01.2001: Social services take internet twins into care</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/internetnews/story/0,7369,423875,00.html\">18.01.2001: Blair demands law on internet baby trade</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423308,00.html\">17.01.2001: The route to adoption</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423306,00.html\">17.01.2001: Difficulties parents face</a></p> <p><b>Online debate</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e12e\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.abcadoptions.com/index.html\" target=\"_NEW\">ABC Adoptions: online adoption resources</a><br><a href=\"http://www.adoption-net.co.uk/faq/faqindex.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Adoption-Net.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://www.baaf.org.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/adoption/intercountry/index.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Intercountry adoption: Department of Health</a></p>",

In a statement, Mr McGreevy said: \"The twins are safe and well in the council's care.\" He called last night's action a \"careful, considered and proportionate response\" to the situation and said that the council had obtained the protection order from a magistrate of the Flintshire Family Proceedings Court. Mr McGreevy added: \"Further legal steps are now in hand which will place all of the issues, including the complex legal, practical and international dimensions, before the High Court prior to the expiry of the emergency protection order on January 26.\" The council refused to comment further on the case. Ms Kilshaw, 47, whose screams could be heard as the children were taken away, said that she had no chance to say goodbye to the babies as the authorities \"crept in, in the dead of the night, and snatched them. This has ripped my family apart,\" she said. Her solicitor husband Alan added: \"We don't feel too good this morning, but, having said that, we feel determined to fight on with this case. I think, at the end of the day, right will prevail.\" \"I think the social services had a bloody cheek,\" Ms Kilshaw added. \"They came in with no clothes and no dummies for them.\" Ms Kilshaw said that she was \"personally hurt\" by the comments of friends and neighbours, and told how she had grown close to the twins since she and her husband had brought them to Britain on a visitors' visa. \"I couldn't have given them more if I'd given birth to them myself. I am public enemy number one and Alan public enemy number two, but people haven't seen us together as a family. \"They are trying to say we are not right people.\" Meanwhile, Californian couple Richard and Vickie Allen, who claim they were duped into handing back the twins after caring for them for two months and paying an adoption broker a reported \u00a34,000, repeated their offer of \"a good home\" for the twins. Ms Allen said, from California, that she sympathised with the Kilshaws after last night's events, adding: \"My heart goes out to them and it does make me upset. \"I've got nothing against them and I can understand the pain they must be feeling having the children taken away from them.\" The twins' natural mother, Tranda Wecker, 28, said yesterday that she wanted the children back. In another move, a senior Arkansas adoption judge told BBC Radio 5 Live that there was likely to be legal action in the state courts over the case, which could render the twins' adoption invalid. Judge Ellen Brantley, who is believed to have been in contact with social workers in Wales to provide them with details of the case, also denounced the selling of babies as \"disgusting\", and described many of those involved in the current case as \"villains\". \"The big issue is that the children, if they are to be adopted, are adopted by parents who can give them a loving and stable home,\" she said. \"That ought to be regardless of the monetary amounts that anybody is able to provide,\" she said. Many Americans choose to adopt under the Arkansas legal system, because of its relaxed rules, which allow adoption within just 10 days. But parents who give children up for adoption must live in Arkansas for at least 30 days, and there have been suggestions that the twins' biological mother might not have fulfilled the residence qualification, invalidating the adoption. The Californian baby broker at the heart of the scandal, Tina Johnson, meanwhile insisted that her Caring Heart agency was a legitimate \"adoption facilitation\" business. Her spokeswoman, Jennifer Coburn, told a news conference: \"Caring Heart does not sell, trade or engage in the trafficking of babies. This is illegal and is not what is happening in this case.\" The agency specialised in African-American and mixed-race children, and charged a non-refundable fee for Ms Johnson's expenses and time, she said. She did not disclose the amount.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>How were the babies 'bought'?</b> <br>Alan and Judith Kilshaw, from Buckley in north Wales, wanted to complete their family by adopting a baby daughter. They found what they wanted through the internet: babies Belinda and Kimberley were being offered for adoption by Tina Johnson of the Caring Hearts [sic] agency in California. They paid \u00a38200 in fees and whisked the little girls off to Arkansas for a 'quickie' adoption. <p><b>What went wrong?</b><br>The babies had already been 'bought' for some \u00a34000 by California couple Vickie and Richard Allen, who say they were tricked into parting with them by their natural mother, Trenda Wecker, who then handed them over to the Kilshaws. </p> <p><b>Any further complications?</b><br>Ms Trecker now says she wants her babies back. And a third couple, Amy and Eddie White, has emerged to say that they too were offered the twins, for \u00a35800. </p> <p><b>Why are the little girls in care?</b><br>Flintshire social services waded through the herd of reporters and photographers covering the story, to pluck the babies from the Mold hotel, where the Kilshaws were staying. They say they are making \"further assessments of the well-being of the children\". </p> <p><b>What reaction has there been to the unsavoury saga?</b><br>Revulsion. Fury. Disgust. And that's just the government. The prime minister and home secretary have promised to step up the pace of adoption law reform, and tighten the rules for couples adopting abroad. There have also been predictable calls for more regulation of the internet, as if that had anything to do with it. </p> <p><b>Hold on, wasn't it the internet that made the whole thing possible?</b><br>No, it was simply the medium through which the Kilshaws contacted the adoption agency. They might have done so in any number of other ways. </p> <p><b>How difficult is it to adopt a child in this country?</b><br>Prospective parents have to be exhaustively vetted for suitability. The process can take six months, and involves detailed social services assessment, police and medical references. </p> <p><b>What are the rules for adopting a foreign child?</b><br>The government would prefer all such adoptions to be from 'designated' countries with laws compatible with the UK's.

      "bodyText": "How were the babies 'bought'? Alan and Judith Kilshaw, from Buckley in north Wales, wanted to complete their family by adopting a baby daughter. They found what they wanted through the internet: babies Belinda and Kimberley were being offered for adoption by Tina Johnson of the Caring Hearts [sic] agency in California. They paid \u00a38200 in fees and whisked the little girls off to Arkansas for a 'quickie' adoption. What went wrong? The babies had already been 'bought' for some \u00a34000 by California couple Vickie and Richard Allen, who say they were tricked into parting with them by their natural mother, Trenda Wecker, who then handed them over to the Kilshaws. Any further complications? Ms Trecker now says she wants her babies back. And a third couple, Amy and Eddie White, has emerged to say that they too were offered the twins, for \u00a35800. Why are the little girls in care? Flintshire social services waded through the herd of reporters and photographers covering the story, to pluck the babies from the Mold hotel, where the Kilshaws were staying. They say they are making \"further assessments of the well-being of the children\". What reaction has there been to the unsavoury saga? Revulsion. Fury. Disgust. And that's just the government. The prime minister and home secretary have promised to step up the pace of adoption law reform, and tighten the rules for couples adopting abroad. There have also been predictable calls for more regulation of the internet, as if that had anything to do with it. Hold on, wasn't it the internet that made the whole thing possible? No, it was simply the medium through which the Kilshaws contacted the adoption agency. They might have done so in any number of other ways. How difficult is it to adopt a child in this country? Prospective parents have to be exhaustively vetted for suitability. The process can take six months, and involves detailed social services assessment, police and medical references. What are the rules for adopting a foreign child? The government would prefer all such adoptions to be from 'designated' countries with laws compatible with the UK's. But there are lots of grey areas, and no defined law against 'private' (ie paid-for) adoptions. Is adoption high on the government's list of priorities? Judging from the Department of Health's adoption web pages, it's the tops. Tony Blair is particularly keen on reform. He commissioned a review of adoption in February last year. A report was published in July. Now the prime minister is committed to new adoption legislation, a white paper, a task force, a national adoption register, and national adoption standards.

And he retaliated - often. Auberon Waugh's death has been eulogised at phenomenal length, not least in two pages in this organ, (five pieces in the Telegraph.) He was a \"genius\" who \"will surely be seen as the Dean Swift of our day,\" writes his old friend AN Wilson. Someone else cites Dr Johnson, forsooth. \"The greatest journalist of my generation,\" writes Lord Gowrie cringingly of the man who hounded him mercilessly for years. \"All prigs and puritans will sleep easier in their beds tonight,\" opines the Telegraph leader. </p> <p>In the Guardian obituary Geoffrey Wheatcroft says Waugh's foes were \"baffled by the boyish camaraderie of old Fleet Street, not to say its tradition of ecumenical friendship\". And baffled we remain. I remember it well - the old world of El Vino's wine bar in Fleet Street where leftwing lambs and rightwing lions downed their differences in bottles of champagne - (no women allowed at the bar). It was all just a game, old boy, at the end of the day once the copy had been filed. What did it matter what you wrote or who you wrote it for so long as it was witty, clever and preferably wicked? Everyone in Grub Street had their saleable trade mark, right or left, but was anything really serious? </p> <p>The world of Auberon Waugh is a coterie of reactionary fogeys centred on the Spectator and the Telegraph who affect an imaginary style of 1930's gent - Evelyn was the icon. Battered brown trilby, chalk-stripes, sit-up-and-beg bike with a basket full of books from the London Library are the accoutrements. The mind-set is all Evelyn Waugh too - the smells and bells of aristocracy and old Catholicism (recusant priest-holers only - God forbid any happy clappy stuff). Effete, drunken, snobbish, sneering, racist and sexist, they spit poison at anyone vulgar enough to want to improve anything at all. Liberalism is the archenemy - Shirley Williams was Waugh's bete noire . While do-nothing conservatism is their mode, they enjoy extremism of any complexion and excoriate the dreary toil of incremental improvement - bor-ring, sin-cere and social workerish. The worst thing is \"doing good\". Their snobbery is of a vulgarity beyond belief - yahoos capering in genteel suits. </p> <p>Their language is as self-consciously class-identifying as their voices - Waugh sounded like something out of the BBC sound archives. Their words cling to the prep school and nursery of the 1940s and 50s - hence that bizarre conservative epithet \"nanny\" or \"nanny state\" applied to the Labour women they especially loathe, as if every voter had a starched Norland nurse lurking in their mental attic. Many of the obits refer to Waugh's boast that he was \"a practitioner of the vituperative arts\", but the limited vocabulary of this little tribe of scribes is reduced to those blas\u00e9 upper-class generalities - ghastly, boring, silly, disgusting, odious, repulsive, bogus, hideous or goody-goody - house style passim in most of the Spectator and Telegraph, lazy in-words of an exclusive clique. </p> <p>We might let Auberon Waugh rest in peace were it not for the mighty damage his clan has done to British political life, journalism and discourse in the postwar years. They have perpetuated the myth of the superior cultured English gent as an archetype. Although Waugh's loathing of American culture made him uniquely amongst this bunch a pro-European, (he loved to be a \"maverick\"), this coterie has lead the spirit of anti-Europeanism that pervades Tory party and country. Christopher Booker, Richard Ingrams and the rest posit a brave little England of crusty country-living upper-class eccentrics versus the dread (another of their words) bureaucracy of Brussels. It's the old world charm of Whisky Galore mischief-making and John Buchan plucky patriots against the humourless foreign swine. They have contributed to a nation afraid of change or modernity, peddling false, sentimental tradition and an upper-class yesterday unavailable to virtually everyone else. While pretending to debunk cant, they demolish every attempt at reform. \"Political correctness\" is the tired, lazy little label attached to all change for the better. Oh, how naughty of Waugh to compare a wine to \"a bunch of dead chrysanthemums on the grave of a still-born West Indian baby\". Swiftian? Knickers. </p> <p>As a style of journalism, theirs is empty and destructive. All that matters is a joke or two. Swift was serious, used humour as a deadly weapon of conviction and risked jail for his opinions. Knee-jerk abuse of any politician was Waugh's stock in trade when he was a political commentator. It was not, as he pretended, a badge of some kind of honesty but quite the contrary, an idle unwillingness to engage with any politician's attempt to make life better for anyone else - least of all \"the workers\" he used to mock in order to shock. The pens of these lofty jeerers drip with universal indiscriminate malice over good and bad people alike, with as much interest in the difference as Jonathan Aitken's \"sword of truth\". </p> <p>Don't imagine that the breed is dying out. Boris Johnson, editor of the Spectator, is only 36, a writer of just this humourous stamp, with mannerisms to match. The fact that the obits proclaim Waugh \"the most courteous and loveable of friends\", or that Boris Johnson is also a charming and affable fellow is neither here nor there: by their printed words we shall judge them (and be judged). Johnson and I are currently arguing weekly on television.* After our first encounter he pressed me to write a piece for the Spectator about why the right is so nasty and why liberals are on the whole nicer - his idea and something he disarmingly thought true: good medicine for his complacent readership, he said. I doubt he wanted them converted, just aroused. </p> <p>It was tempting but I refused. He grew indignant. Why not? I explained it concerned exactly that \"ecumenical tradition\" in old Fleet Street which Wheatcroft so extolled yesterday. Why would I want to write in a rightwing magazine graced by Bruce Anderson as political commentator, the unspeakable Taki and a fusillade of writers of the ilk described above? Politics in the Spectator, I said, is just an Eton Wall Game between left/right tribes. Joining in the mud-slinging fun only adds to the general idea that the Spectator is right - it's all a jolly jape and none of it really matters. Consider William Hague - tax cuts for the rich, public service cuts for the rest, pulling out of Europe, stuffing yet more into prison, installing Bush's missile system. Where's the joke? I never understood why Michael Foot and AJP Taylor wrote for Beaverbrook as his trophy lefties, satisfying the right's perennial wish to think that in the end there is no real difference between civilised Oxbridge-educated people sitting cosily around the same dinner table. </p> <p> *Head to Head, Sundays BBC News 24, 9.30pm. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "byline": "Emma Brockes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sir John Mills is asleep when we arrive at his house in Denham, Buckinghamshire, a village unmolested by progress since he moved there in 1942 to be near Denham film studios. In those days his neighbours were David Niven and the glamorous Oliviers; it is ghostly now, a reminder to Sir John that he is one of the last actors of his generation, a man held in awe as a survivor of a more graceful age. </p> <p>The 92-year-old is tired because the previous day he and his 89-year -old wife, Mary, renewed their marriage vows in a blaze of press attention which, his assistant lets on, the actor \"just loved\". In the post that morning was a card from the Queen and the house is thick with the smell of lilies, crammed into every available receptacle and bearing messages from the great and the good of British theatre. </p> <p>Surveying Sir John's living room is like waiting for your eyes to adjust to a sudden change of light. In outline, it looks like the aggregate of any elderly couple's life together, a jumble of discordant chairs, paintings and trinkets amassed from every decade since 1910. After a few minutes, however, the room focuses into the weirdest conflation of the banal and the extraordinary that I have ever seen. On the grand piano in the corner are arranged a set of typical family photos: John and Mary when they married in London during the war; their three children, Juliet, Jonathan and Hayley, instantly recognisable from her child-acting roles in such films as Whistle Down the Wind and the Parent Trap. Tucked behind these is a shot of the Mills' late, great friend, Vivien Leigh, in her Gone with the Wind era, and behind that, obscured by clutter, a photo of Noel Coward bearing a scribbled inscription. A 90th birthday card from the Queen Mother hangs on the wall and every cigar box, every trinket, bears some kind of engraved tribute: from the British Film Industry World Sporting Club, the Greater London Fund for the Blind, the St James Gentleman's Club. By the time you start leafing through a book called John Mills, A Life In Pictures, the echoes from bygone Hollywood make his continued existence almost impossible to countenance. </p> <p>He is, none the less, very much alive and very much in love with Mary, who has Alzheimer's disease, and who he refers to instantly in terms of how beautiful she looked at the wedding. \"She did, didn't she?\" he says, his distillate blue eyes showing no sign that he is almost totally blind. \"It was a marvellous day. Mary was very, very with it. She usually uses a chair, but she insisted on walking down the aisle and the congregation just went mad. The rector cleverly arranged it so that I could say 'we' during the vows and speak for both of us. I took her a carnation in with breakfast this morning and she was smiling away. She'll never forget it.\" </p> <p>An unabashed romantic, Sir John chose their diamond wedding anniversary to restage the ceremony they had to hurry the first time round so he could return to the war. (There is something of the old soldier still in him, he loves precision - the walk from his house to the station is exactly eight minutes, he says; on a good day, the drive from Denham to his club in London's St James is 24 minutes.) He felt he had \"done her out\" of a white wedding and should make amends in Denham's beautiful St Mary's church, with the media platoon cooing outside. </p> <p>\"The first time round, I was on 48-hour leave. It was a rush job. We went for our honeymoon in Dukes Hotel, Jermyn Street, which a month later was flattened by the blitz, so it was rather lucky we weren't killed. We used to stay there before we were married and one night we were standing under the lamp-post having a cuddle, and the manager, who was a great friend of ours, looked at us and said, 'You know, it's lovely to see you two together, when are you getting married?'\" </p> <p>Doing the decent thing, of course, is how we have come to characterise Sir John Mills, whose roles in all those dashing war films - In Which we Serve, We Dive at Dawn, Ice Cold in Alex - established him as an actor of almost mythical English qualities, before such things were agonised over for jingoism. (His daughter Hayley, he says, is \"determinedly English\", which he is pleased about). </p> <p>\"I just love the country. I turned down very big, lucrative film contracts, because it meant leaving England and I just didn't want to. I've worked in LA for six months at a time, but I've never signed for two or three years, which I'm glad about. When I was 20, I was offered a huge deal with Twentieth Century Fox and Noel Coward took me off to dinner and spent three hours persuading me it wasn't a wise thing. He said, 'You're a very good actor, but you will become a sort of Johnny Garfield or a Jimmy Cagney - a personality. You'll never play anything else. I think you should learn your trade here and then start making movies.' I am delighted that I did that, because that life wouldn't have suited me or Mary. I think my favourite part of all was playing William Mossop in Hobson's Choice. Now, you see, you wouldn't have done that in Hollywood.\" </p> <p>It wasn't an easy decision to make, however. He was in a film called Royal Cavalcade, earning \u00a315 a week which would have leapt up to \u00a3150 a week if he had gone to Fox. \"But you see, the counties here are all different, the accents are all different. You can go to Cornwall, and it could be another country. You are near all the other capitals too, Rome and so forth.\" </p> <p>\"America,\" says Sir John, with divine sniffiness, \"is rather stuck out from things.\" </p> <p>In the 30s, Denham, in spite of its size, was most definitely not stuck out from things. Some of the most successful British films were made in the studios there: Brief Encounter, the 49th Parallel, Goodbye Mr Chips. \"David Lean lived right in the village,\" says Sir John. \"The Oliviers lived a couple of miles up the road. David Niven was here. It was fun. It was like a little Beverly Hills of England.\" </p> <p>That is all long gone now, he says sadly. Even his great friend \"Dickie, Sir Richard Attenborough\", must scramble for funding, a fact Sir John finds distasteful in the extreme. He is generous to his acting successors, however, and is not nostalgic for some glory period of British acting. \"Darling, I think good actors are good actors. I can think of two: one is Tony Hopkins, who is exactly like any other big actor I've known. Kenneth Branagh is the same.

      "bodyText": "Sir John Mills is asleep when we arrive at his house in Denham, Buckinghamshire, a village unmolested by progress since he moved there in 1942 to be near Denham film studios. In those days his neighbours were David Niven and the glamorous Oliviers; it is ghostly now, a reminder to Sir John that he is one of the last actors of his generation, a man held in awe as a survivor of a more graceful age. The 92-year-old is tired because the previous day he and his 89-year -old wife, Mary, renewed their marriage vows in a blaze of press attention which, his assistant lets on, the actor \"just loved\". In the post that morning was a card from the Queen and the house is thick with the smell of lilies, crammed into every available receptacle and bearing messages from the great and the good of British theatre. Surveying Sir John's living room is like waiting for your eyes to adjust to a sudden change of light. In outline, it looks like the aggregate of any elderly couple's life together, a jumble of discordant chairs, paintings and trinkets amassed from every decade since 1910. After a few minutes, however, the room focuses into the weirdest conflation of the banal and the extraordinary that I have ever seen. On the grand piano in the corner are arranged a set of typical family photos: John and Mary when they married in London during the war; their three children, Juliet, Jonathan and Hayley, instantly recognisable from her child-acting roles in such films as Whistle Down the Wind and the Parent Trap. Tucked behind these is a shot of the Mills' late, great friend, Vivien Leigh, in her Gone with the Wind era, and behind that, obscured by clutter, a photo of Noel Coward bearing a scribbled inscription. A 90th birthday card from the Queen Mother hangs on the wall and every cigar box, every trinket, bears some kind of engraved tribute: from the British Film Industry World Sporting Club, the Greater London Fund for the Blind, the St James Gentleman's Club. By the time you start leafing through a book called John Mills, A Life In Pictures, the echoes from bygone Hollywood make his continued existence almost impossible to countenance. He is, none the less, very much alive and very much in love with Mary, who has Alzheimer's disease, and who he refers to instantly in terms of how beautiful she looked at the wedding. \"She did, didn't she?\" he says, his distillate blue eyes showing no sign that he is almost totally blind. \"It was a marvellous day. Mary was very, very with it. She usually uses a chair, but she insisted on walking down the aisle and the congregation just went mad. The rector cleverly arranged it so that I could say 'we' during the vows and speak for both of us. I took her a carnation in with breakfast this morning and she was smiling away. She'll never forget it.\" An unabashed romantic, Sir John chose their diamond wedding anniversary to restage the ceremony they had to hurry the first time round so he could return to the war. (There is something of the old soldier still in him, he loves precision - the walk from his house to the station is exactly eight minutes, he says; on a good day, the drive from Denham to his club in London's St James is 24 minutes.) He felt he had \"done her out\" of a white wedding and should make amends in Denham's beautiful St Mary's church, with the media platoon cooing outside. \"The first time round, I was on 48-hour leave. It was a rush job. We went for our honeymoon in Dukes Hotel, Jermyn Street, which a month later was flattened by the blitz, so it was rather lucky we weren't killed. We used to stay there before we were married and one night we were standing under the lamp-post having a cuddle, and the manager, who was a great friend of ours, looked at us and said, 'You know, it's lovely to see you two together, when are you getting married?'\" Doing the decent thing, of course, is how we have come to characterise Sir John Mills, whose roles in all those dashing war films - In Which we Serve, We Dive at Dawn, Ice Cold in Alex - established him as an actor of almost mythical English qualities, before such things were agonised over for jingoism. (His daughter Hayley, he says, is \"determinedly English\", which he is pleased about). \"I just love the country. I turned down very big, lucrative film contracts, because it meant leaving England and I just didn't want to. I've worked in LA for six months at a time, but I've never signed for two or three years, which I'm glad about. When I was 20, I was offered a huge deal with Twentieth Century Fox and Noel Coward took me off to dinner and spent three hours persuading me it wasn't a wise thing. He said, 'You're a very good actor, but you will become a sort of Johnny Garfield or a Jimmy Cagney - a personality. You'll never play anything else. I think you should learn your trade here and then start making movies.' I am delighted that I did that, because that life wouldn't have suited me or Mary. I think my favourite part of all was playing William Mossop in Hobson's Choice. Now, you see, you wouldn't have done that in Hollywood.\" It wasn't an easy decision to make, however. He was in a film called Royal Cavalcade, earning \u00a315 a week which would have leapt up to \u00a3150 a week if he had gone to Fox. \"But you see, the counties here are all different, the accents are all different. You can go to Cornwall, and it could be another country. You are near all the other capitals too, Rome and so forth.\" \"America,\" says Sir John, with divine sniffiness, \"is rather stuck out from things.\" In the 30s, Denham, in spite of its size, was most definitely not stuck out from things. Some of the most successful British films were made in the studios there: Brief Encounter, the 49th Parallel, Goodbye Mr Chips. \"David Lean lived right in the village,\" says Sir John. \"The Oliviers lived a couple of miles up the road. David Niven was here. It was fun. It was like a little Beverly Hills of England.\" That is all long gone now, he says sadly. Even his great friend \"Dickie, Sir Richard Attenborough\", must scramble for funding, a fact Sir John finds distasteful in the extreme. He is generous to his acting successors, however, and is not nostalgic for some glory period of British acting. \"Darling, I think good actors are good actors. I can think of two: one is Tony Hopkins, who is exactly like any other big actor I've known. Kenneth Branagh is the same. You can't really change good acting.\" I ask if he is fully retired now. \"Oh God, no!\" he says, indignantly. \"I've got a script here, which I've got to give an answer to in three days time. It's a series with Nigel Havers. I still enjoy it, touch wood. Learning's not so easy - I have to do it by tape - but I am an optimist and firmly believe in MOM - mind over matter.\" He is certainly still feisty. Last summer, a friend of my mother's was strolling through Denham and started taking photos of the wisteria growing on the outside of Sir John's house. He charged out, waving his cane and telling her in no uncertain terms to piss off. To explain his continuing verve, Sir John relates the story of a late friend of his \"a marvellous actor called AE Matthews, who at the age of 80 took on a new role in the theatre. He was running for the tube in his plus-fours one day and a young reporter was trying to keep up with him. 'Mr Matthews,' he said, 'you're quite extraordinary, doing eight shows a week and here you are running for the tube. How do you explain it?' Matthews turned around and said, 'Quite simply dear fellow, I take the Times.' 'What do you mean, Mr Matthews?' asked the reporter. \"Matthews said, 'I open it up, I read the obituaries. If I'm not in it, I get up.' \" \"That's a good idea, isn't it?\" says Sir John. \"You keep getting up.\"",

The BSkyB-owned channel's decision to use the controversial US reality show as a spoiler on E4's launch night paid dividends. The show, in which couples are left on a tropical island and tempted into indiscretions with a single people, pulled in 557,000 viewers and a 7% share, according to unofficial overnights. Temptation Island, screened at 10pm, beat the second half of ER's season premiere, which pulled in 280,000 viewers between 9.30pm and 10.30pm. Channel 4's new Japanese-style game show, Banzai, which was up against the second half-hour of Temptation Island, got an audience of just 120,000 viewers. Channel 4 bosses were today glossing over the damage wraught by Temptation Island, declaring the station had \"launched with a bang\". The first episode in a Friends double bill pulled in 498,000 viewers, easily seeing off a Sky One repeat of the Simpsons, which was watched by 250,000. Up to 600,000 viewers tuned in to the second instalment of the US sitcom. The average audience for the show was 563,000, giving it a comfortable lead over Sky One's As Extreme as it Gets, which was seen by 410,000 between 9pm and 10pm. However, Sky One did better overall, posting an average share of viewing of 5.1% in multi-channel homes last night. E4 notched up a 3.3% share despite a marketing blitz over recent days. Nevertheless, Channel 4 declared the launch a huge success - E4 was the third most-watched pay-TV channel after Sky One and UK Gold. And between 8pm and 12.45am, it was second only to Sky One. \"We are flattered that Sky is taking a new channel so seriously, especially when it is only available in two-thirds of Sky One homes,\" said a Channel 4 spokesman. E4 is only available in 60% of multi-channel homes, while Sky One is distributed to around 90%. \"This was a stunning performance for a new channel,\" said Gerry Bastable, Channel 4's managing director of pay-TV.",

      "bodyText": "Last night's dramatic seizure of the internet twins by police and social workers at a north Wales hotel came amid growing political furore about the cynical trade in babies and increasing concern over the suitability of Alan and Judith Kilshaw as adoptive parents. Social workers were also worried about the publicity surrounding the twins, and appeared dissatisfied with assurances from the Kilshaws that the children would be readily available for inspection to ensure their well-being. With fresh doubts about the couple's characters emerging, the twins' natural mother demanded their return and a third couple came forward to say they had been offered the children. Mr Kilshaw, a solicitor, drew criticism for suggesting that the story of how the couple obtained the girls could be sold to Hollywood. In the US the girls' natural mother claimed she did not feel they were fit parents. This raised suggestions that the twins are likely to become part of a protracted legal tussle involving Britain and America. Tranda Wecker, a 28-year- old receptionist, told CBS Television: \"I really want my girls back. I really do. I feel like I was betrayed - I feel that they need to come back to the States to settle this adoption.\" She told ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald Show that she wanted her daughters to have \"the best possible parents\", adding: \"Financially I cannot give them the world, but I love my girls.\" Whatever happens now, it seems clear that the twins are likely to become part of a bitter legal tussle. Asked whether she would continue to fight for custody, Mrs Kilshaw replied firmly: \"Yes.\" Speaking on the same programme as Ms Wecker, Mrs Kilshaw asked: \"Why did she give them up in the first place?

The Kilshaws' actions - paying \u00a38,200 for the twins, who had already been handed to another couple who had paid half that amount - have caused huge controversy in Britain. Tony Blair has promised early legislation to halt what he called the \"deplorable\" practice of trading children for adoption.

They are part of our family now. It is all legal.\" Speaking from the hotel where the Kilshaws were spending the day, Caley Kilshaw repudiated accusations that the family home was an unfit place for children because it was dirty. Perhaps the most embarrassing revelation yesterday was that the Kilshaws called in paranormal investigators after they and their children thought they saw, heard or felt unexplained phenomena in their north Wales farmhouse. Mr Kilshaw claimed that Hollywood film makers had already been in touch. He said he had told them: \"Let's get it on.\" This has fuelled criticism that the couple are publicity hungry. Across the Atlantic, Amy and Eddie White, from New York state, claimed they had agreed to pay an adoption agency \u00a35,800 but the deal had collapsed when they failed to pay quickly enough.

The debate over bringing \"broadband\" telecommunications links into the home goes back at least 15 years - but it still hasn't arrived. In the mid 1980s the government decided to leave it to market forces rather than authorise BT to go ahead with a massive investment in fibre optic cables in exchange for being allowed to deliver \"entertainment\" (mainly video) down the line. The trouble was that BT was left with a virtual monopoly of the profitable \"local loop\", the last mile or so of wire that connects the home to the local exchange. Understandably, from its own point of view, it wants to hang on to these monopoly profits as long as possible - so it hasn't exactly been busting keen to open up the local loop to competitors who have been complaining bitterly about BT dragging its feet. Competition in the local loop would almost certainly have accelerated the introduction of broadband. BT has been under pressure from the government and the regulator for some time to allow competitors to deliver a broadband (high capacity) telephone line into homes so it isn't just the preserve of businesses. The government is concerned that slow access doesn't become an issue in the general election campaign. BT's response was to start opening the loop in less densely populated areas which obviously are not as attractive to competitors as the built-up areas. Yesterday Oftel announced an agreement to accelerate the existing timetable for unbundling the loop which ought to bring access quicker to densely populated areas. The widespread availability of broadband access to the internet is vital if Britain is to be at the leading edge of delivering films, video, conference vision and other digital products to the world's exploding internet population. Those countries that are early adopters of new technologies are in a good position to enable their own businesses to piggyback on their success by selling their expertise abroad. Although BT has been dragging its feet, Britain is still doing reasonably well on adoption of broadband options like ADSL compared with most countries on the Continent. BT claims that Britain will be out among the leaders when the local loop is finally opened up. However, the concentration on densely populated areas, while attractive to the companies involved, raises the danger of opening a \"digital divide\" between richer and poorer parts of the country. BT claims that there isn't much point in providing broadband access, at enormous expense, to outlying areas that won't use it much and which could obtain access to the internet through their television screens or mobile phones. Britain's approach - relying on market forces goaded by the regulator - is in marked contrast to the policy adopted in Singapore where the government decided to build fibre optic connections to most homes, a task that has largely been accomplished.

The government in Kinshasa officially informed other African states that Mr Kabila had been murdered by one of his own military officers but gave no explanation as to why it had lied for two days about the president's fate. Diplomats believe that the authorities wanted to ensure that the assassinated ruler's son, Joseph Kabila, was firmly installed as Congo's new leader before confirming the killing. Officials had continued to deny his death even though foreign governments said they were certain of it and Zimbabwe's defence minister, Moven Mahachi, announced that the corpse was lying in a Harare morgue. Mr Mahachi said the assassinated president died on a flight to Zimbabwe after doctors were unable to save him in Kinshasa. Joseph Kabila, 31, who is head of land forces in the war against Rwandan and Ugandan-backed rebels, was expected to broadcast a message last night to the Congolese people, who are the last to be told officially of the demise of their president. The message was also likely to be an appeal for support. The new leader commands little support among the Congolese people who generally did not like his father and are suspicious of the son's relative youth and the manner of his coming to power. Neither is he particularly respected in the military he commands, as a result of both his lack of experience and his notorious brutality. But Joseph Kabila presumably succeeded his father with the blessing of Zimbabwe and Angola, Congo's two principal backers in the war. Rebels yesterday called on the new president to seize the opportunity presented by his father's death to end the civil war. The main rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, pledged that it would not take military advantage of Laurent Kabila's assassination but said it would keep fighting if the country's new leader did not begin to implement the Lusaka peace accords his father had blocked. \"It is a pity to see Kabila's son the head of state.

Laurent Kabila's body is expected to be flown back to Congo at the weekend amid conflicting reports about plans for his burial.

But he is the first African ruler to succeed his father, other than in the smattering of monarchies on the continent. And the large numbers of other members of the Kabila family in positions of power suggests a quasi dynasty in the making.</p> <p>Laurent Kabila made one cousin his home affairs minister and another the minister of justice. A third was his chief military aide and a brother-in-law was inspector general of police. Nephews were given high military posts, and other relatives permeate a system whose only purpose was to keep Kabila as president of Congo.</p> <p>Now it falls to his son to keep the family in control. And it is not only his youth that counts against him. He spent so much of his life outside the country's borders, mostly in Tanzania, that he hardly speaks French, Congo's official language, or Lingala, the most widely spoken language in Kinshasa.</p> <p>To add to the suspicion, Joseph has a Tutsi mother.

      "bodyText": "Joseph Kabila Mulubakat, 31, is not the youngest military ruler to come to power in Africa. But he is the first African ruler to succeed his father, other than in the smattering of monarchies on the continent. And the large numbers of other members of the Kabila family in positions of power suggests a quasi dynasty in the making. Laurent Kabila made one cousin his home affairs minister and another the minister of justice. A third was his chief military aide and a brother-in-law was inspector general of police. Nephews were given high military posts, and other relatives permeate a system whose only purpose was to keep Kabila as president of Congo. Now it falls to his son to keep the family in control. And it is not only his youth that counts against him. He spent so much of his life outside the country's borders, mostly in Tanzania, that he hardly speaks French, Congo's official language, or Lingala, the most widely spoken language in Kinshasa. To add to the suspicion, Joseph has a Tutsi mother. To many Congolese that makes him a foreigner. Laurent Kabila was not noted for his intellect or leadership qualities, but he is said to have shone brightly beside his son, who has come to believe he is a great military commander, despite an experience limited to three months of training with the Beijing military academy. Joseph has even been publicly derided by some of the soldiers he supposedly commanded. A day or two after the Rwandans and Ugandans marched into the southern Congolese city of Lubumbashi four years ago, on their way to overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko, the younger Kabila turned up to claim credit for the victory. He was, ostensibly, his father's military chief and so technically in charge of the rebel forces on the ground. It was a nonsense made clear by a Ugandan officer who publicly derided him as the \"little chief\". But that did not stop his father making him commander of land forces in the present war, to the disgust of the few real soldiers. But whatever Joseph's limitations, he has inherited his father's acumen for deals. He has made a lot of money in business with one of the relatives of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.

      "bodyText": "China's unmanned Shenzhou II spacecraft has landed in the country's northern grasslands, returning its passengers which included a monkey, a dog, a rabbit and snails. The spacecraft orbited the earth 108 times, state television has reported, as Beijing prepares for a manned flight in the next five years. State media have said only that \"various life forms\" including animals, plants, aquatic creatures, microbes and cells made the journey, but gave no other details. An official from the Jiuquan launch centre in northwest China laughed when asked to confirm the news, saying it was a state secret. Officials from the Beijing Space Control Centre, which operates under the military, could not be reached for comment. China Central Television said the Shenzhou space capsule successfully carried out a battery of instrument tests and scientific experiments in communications and science, without providing details. \"The second space test was a complete success,\" CCTV said in its brief report. Western experts believe the flight of the Shenzhou II puts China a step closer to becoming only the third nation, after the United States and the former Soviet Union, to launch a person into outer space. China has extolled its space ambitions as a sign of its rising might and influence, although so far it has provided scant details on the flights or its secretive space program, code-named Project 921. CCTV reported the capsule landed in the central part of barren Inner Mongolia, apparently the same area where the first Shenzhou flight landed in November 1999 after orbiting Earth for 21 hours. Previous reports by the official Xinhua News Agency said the Shenzhou was conducting experiments in physics, voice transmission, astronomy and the environment of space. Newspaper reports on last Wednesday's launch said the space capsule also carried cell and tissue samples of 87 animals, plants and micro-organisms.

But the president did not bow out without a parting shot for the next administration.</p> <p>He called on president-elect Bush to continue the Clinton administration's work to pay off the national debt, to continue to intervene overseas to advance American interests and to tackle racism across the country.</p> <p>He said: \"America must maintain our record of fiscal responsibility. Through our last four budgets, we've turned record deficits to record surpluses and we've been able to pay down $600bn of our national debt, on track to be debt-free by the end of the decade for the first time since 1835.\"</p> <p>Obviously fearing that Mr Bush will put foreign policy on the back burner, Mr Clinton made a plea for continued involvement overseas.</p> <p>He told the nation, \"Global poverty is a powder keg that could be ignited by our indifference. In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson warned of entangling alliances. But in our times, America cannot and must not disentangle itself from the world. If we want the world to embody our shared values, then we must assume a shared responsibility.\"</p> <p>Mr Clinton's future career has been the subject of much speculation, especially as he will continue to live in Washington.

      "bodyText": "As his successor, George W Bush, celebrated with a rally at the Lincoln memorial in Washington DC, President Clinton last night delivered his farewell speech from the Oval office, calling the last eight years a time of \"dramatic upheaval\" and an \"era of great American renewal.\" Mr Clinton - who has one of the highest popularity ratings of any outgoing president - recalled the accomplishments of his administration during the televised address and highlighted the same issue that saw him elected in 1992: the economy. \"Our economy is breaking records with more than 22m new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the highest home ownership ever, the longest expansion in history,\" he said. The speech carefully avoided any reference to the humiliating sex scandal or the bitter impeachment battle that overshadowed his second term in office. But the president did not bow out without a parting shot for the next administration. He called on president-elect Bush to continue the Clinton administration's work to pay off the national debt, to continue to intervene overseas to advance American interests and to tackle racism across the country. He said: \"America must maintain our record of fiscal responsibility. Through our last four budgets, we've turned record deficits to record surpluses and we've been able to pay down $600bn of our national debt, on track to be debt-free by the end of the decade for the first time since 1835.\" Obviously fearing that Mr Bush will put foreign policy on the back burner, Mr Clinton made a plea for continued involvement overseas. He told the nation, \"Global poverty is a powder keg that could be ignited by our indifference. In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson warned of entangling alliances. But in our times, America cannot and must not disentangle itself from the world. If we want the world to embody our shared values, then we must assume a shared responsibility.\" Mr Clinton's future career has been the subject of much speculation, especially as he will continue to live in Washington. He made no announcements about his future in the speech, saying only that he would \"never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of president.\" Outside the White House, Pennsylvania Avenue was lined with thousands of bleachers and a gleaming white presidential reviewing stand for the inaugural parade. Mr Bush was in residence at the Blair House, the presidential guesthouse. Mr Clinton has issued a blizzard of executive orders and environmental actions in recent days, and presidential pardons are due to be issued today. Also anticipated is removal of economic and trade sanctions against Yugoslavia and the release of remaining money - about $100m (\u00a370m) - in a $1.3bn Colombian anti-drug aid package.

      "byline": "By Rachel Gordon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Soaring rents in UK hotspots such as London, the Thames Valley and parts of the west country, are fuelling the buy to let mortgage market.</p> <p>But, while first rate returns and capital growth can be achieved, those wanting a piece of the action the need to do their homework. If not, the novice landlord can be left with an unwanted and unprofitable property that could create huge financial problems.</p> <p>Owning a second home that is let out to good tenants can be a fantastic investment. </p> <p>According to Bradford &amp; Bingley letting agencies, average returns on rented properties are 8%. It says nationally average yields range from 6% for a detached four-bedroom house to 8% for a two-bedroom flat.</p> <p>It is predicted that demand for rented property will grow because of the high divorce rate, job mobility and the fact that many people can't afford to buy a home.</p> <p>But buying to let is far from risk free. At the same time, many people who have opted for the supposedly safer route of investments and pensions and been disappointed by the returns, may be looking for an alternative. </p> <p>The disastrous situation at Equitable Life, which has closed to new business and could leave hundreds of investors out of pocket, has cast a shadow over the whole pensions industry and a rented property can return a higher and regular income.</p> <p>Yet, while renting may continue to bring in an income, landlords also have to be prepared for pitfalls. These could be that rent is withheld or that tenants cause damage. </p> <p>A property could also be left vacant if there is too much rented property on the market meaning the landlord could potentially have to pay for two mortgages. A property slump could also affect the property's value and make it hard to resell. </p> <p>Then there are costs. Heavy repair bills are a possibility and a property is also likely to need decorating and furnishing. Insurance is also required.</p> <p>Then there is the cost of a letting and managing agency.

      "bodyText": "Soaring rents in UK hotspots such as London, the Thames Valley and parts of the west country, are fuelling the buy to let mortgage market. But, while first rate returns and capital growth can be achieved, those wanting a piece of the action the need to do their homework. If not, the novice landlord can be left with an unwanted and unprofitable property that could create huge financial problems. Owning a second home that is let out to good tenants can be a fantastic investment. According to Bradford &amp; Bingley letting agencies, average returns on rented properties are 8%. It says nationally average yields range from 6% for a detached four-bedroom house to 8% for a two-bedroom flat. It is predicted that demand for rented property will grow because of the high divorce rate, job mobility and the fact that many people can't afford to buy a home. But buying to let is far from risk free. At the same time, many people who have opted for the supposedly safer route of investments and pensions and been disappointed by the returns, may be looking for an alternative. The disastrous situation at Equitable Life, which has closed to new business and could leave hundreds of investors out of pocket, has cast a shadow over the whole pensions industry and a rented property can return a higher and regular income. Yet, while renting may continue to bring in an income, landlords also have to be prepared for pitfalls. These could be that rent is withheld or that tenants cause damage. A property could also be left vacant if there is too much rented property on the market meaning the landlord could potentially have to pay for two mortgages. A property slump could also affect the property's value and make it hard to resell. Then there are costs. Heavy repair bills are a possibility and a property is also likely to need decorating and furnishing. Insurance is also required. Then there is the cost of a letting and managing agency. A reputable agency can help with finding quality tenants, dealing with any problems and ensuring there are no voids. Any landlord who also has a full time job or does not live locally may find using an agency essential. Any agency used should always be registered with ARLA (the association of residential letting agents). Agents tend to charge around 10 to 12% of the gross annual rent for finding tenants and 6% for managing the property. All these costs add up and landlords could lose up to 30% of their projected income through these. Buy to let mortgages also cost more than those aimed at buyers who simply want to own and live in their home. But, there are now far better deals on the market. Bristol &amp; West has recently improved its terms and is offering rates at below 9% - something unheard of several years ago. Lenders have different criteria when it comes to weighing up the potential of a buy to let property. Among the factors likely to be taken into consideration are the borrower's income and what the property is likely to bring in compared to the mortgage outgoings. Bristol &amp; West requires the expected rent to be 125% of the rate being paid. If you are considering investing in property, you need to provide the lender with a sizeable deposit - most will require at least 25% as a down payment, although a few will accept 15%. There is also far more choice of lenders with over 50 buy to let mortgage providers on the market. For inexperienced landlords it is worth taking advice from either an independent financial adviser or a mortgage introducer who follows the Mortgage Code. Pink Home Loans, for example, allows borrowers to take payment holidays and reduce the term.

There might be an annual ruckus around its publication, but one can no more phone Michelin and question one of its inspectors than waltz into MI6 and ask to speak to one of its best spies. </p> <p>It's true that while the MI6 building sits amid a cloud of radio-interference just one mile from Westminster, the HQ of the Michelin Red Guide lies in rather less grand surroundings, a few doors down from the office of the Inland Revenue in Watford. But it is said that Michelin inspectors' identities are as carefully guarded as state secrets. </p> <p>The status of these near-mythical creatures is such that restaurants will always keep half an eye out for one. Those in the know say that the best way for the rest of us to ensure tip-top service in a restaurant that aspires to excellence is to: (a) dine alone (Michelin inspectors eat two full-scale meals a day for three weeks out of every four - the guide could not possibly afford to pay for dining companions as well); (b) order the specialities of the house (to be avoided at all costs are little-effort-required kitchen staples such as smoked salmon - inspectors always choose the most testing dishes, homemade terrines, for example); (c) be a man (it is generally believed that Michelin inspectors are men). </p> <p>So what is known of these inspectors who can make or break a chef's career? Well, they number 10 (eight men, two women), are in their 30s and 40s, and are all British. That is all. </p> <p>And despite what you might think, theirs is not an easy life. Unlike a spy, a Michelin inspector is permitted to reveal his (or her) occupation to his friends and family, but his visits to restaurants, aside from one \"announced visit\" every year, must be done incognito. His time is spent, for the most part, on the road, sent off for two or three weeks to a specific area of Britain or Ireland, his working day starting at 8am, visiting six hotels and eating at two restaurants before he goes to bed at around 11pm. </p> <p>It is up to the inspector to ensure that no stone in his allocated area is left unturned. Every establishment that has won a place in the current guide receives a visit. Beyond that, the best way for an inspector to ferret out good places is by asking locals, but the Yellow Pages, newspaper, tourist offices, other guidebooks and readers' opinions are also canvassed. </p> <p>Nothing is written down inside the place being inspected. \"Having a notepad beside you would give things away straight away,\" says the current editor, who, wishing to remain nameless, shall be referred to as M. \"That's why you need very good concentration and a good memory.\" Instead, the Michelin inspector will slip to the toilet with his notebook or scribble down the details of his meal as soon as he gets back to his car. </p> <p>A Michelin inspector must be highly accomplished. \"We look for people with an appreciation for the finer things in life,\" says M. \"A knowledge of architecture, or furnishings, for instance, is very useful. If they're going to say somewhere is antique furnished, they need to know that it is.\" </p> <p>An inspector must also be a good decision-maker, and a good observer. \"You need to be able to walk round a hotel, say, appearing fully absorbed in the conversation you're having with them, while taking in every detail.\" </p> <p>What is not necessary is to be able to dissect the contents of a restaurant dish. A Michelin inspector need not be able to identify, say, that a tomato has been grown in France and ripened on the vine. \"The question is: does it taste good? You can get too tied up with asking if the bread was homemade on the premises or not. If it's delicious, but made somewhere else, does it matter? Not really.\" </p> <p>M ought to know. A former inspector, he now shoulders the burden of maintaining a consistent standard of inspection. In 20 years of professional eating in restaurants, he has had food poisoning six times, once had to sleep in his hotel bath because of bats in his room, and has found himself marooned on remote Scottish islands on several occasions. </p> <p>One of the strangest episodes in his seven-year inspecting career occurred in a Thai restaurant in South Wales. \"Dinner proceeded normally up to the main course, when the staff suddenly vanished and reappeared dressed in normal clothes, sitting at a table in the restaurant. There was an immigration raid. The waiters didn't have work permits and so they transformed into customers while the real customers waited hungrily at their tables until the raid was over.\" </p> <p>So how are Michelin inspectors recruited? The guide places an ad in the trade press asking for an inspector. A few basic qualifications are necessary: an HND in hotel and catering is a must, plus substantial experience at managerial level in hotels, and as a chef in a reputable restaurant. Ideally, an applicant would be aged 28-35. </p> <p> The final three candidates are taken out for a meal and told to write a report in the Michelin style. Once selected, a trainee will shadow an experienced Michelin man for four to six months before being sent out alone. </p> <p>But what restaurateurs want to know is how to win a coveted star. Not by overt showing off. \"I think the most difficult thing in cooking is to create a very elaborate dish but to present it to make it look quite simple,\" says M. \"Most of the dishes at Troisgros, in France, which has three Michelin stars, fit the bill. Their salmon with sorrel appears very simple, but they've raised it to such a height that it becomes a masterpiece. The great chefs refine and refine and refine, taking out any unnecessary flavours.\" </p> <p>In the 2000 guide, there were 98 starred restaurants. This year there are 103. Every year there are two dozen or so in the running for a first star. Each will receive a visit from M. All restaurants being examined for a star will be eaten in about six times, by different inspectors choosing different menus at different times. </p> <p>The Michelin guide has moved on in the past few years. It may surprise some to hear that it boasts more Italian and Indian restaurants than French. It also focuses on value for money, with the \"bib gourmand\", an award to places where one can eat very well for less than \u00a325 a head. </p> <p>But the level of secrecy and objectivity remains undiminished, aside from one small (no doubt accidental) confession from the great M himself, who admits he's \"not a great fan of olives or anchovies\". Not, of course, that he would allow his personal tastes to shape his judgment.</p>",

The row over his appointment to the Climbi\u00e9 inquiry is the second time in the past two months he has found himself at the centre of controversy. In December last year he stepped down as head of the Harold Shipman inquiry after relatives of the victims of the murderous Greater Manchester GP won a judicial review forcing the inquiry to be held in public. Health secretary Alan Milburn widened the scope of the inquiry and replaced Lord Laming with senior high court judge Dame Janet Smith. The Climbi\u00e9 inquiry will examine the conduct of professionals in the NHS, social services, housing departments and police across four London boroughs. In January last year Lord Laming headed a Home Office inquiry into raising standards at underperforming prisons. He was born in Newcastle and trained as a probation officer in Nottingham until moving to Hertfordshire county council in 1971. He was appointed director of social services in Hertfordshire in 1975. He left in 1991 to become chief inspector of social services, retiring in 1998. He was knighted in 1996 and made a life peer in 1998.

      "body": "<p>OK, I admit it. I don't like the 70s. I hate the music, I hate the TV shows, I hate the flares. I even hate Bohemian Rhapsody. Or I thought I did until last month, during the party season, when I realised that the previously dreaded decade was actually the backbone of my wardrobe. Shiny satin panelling, gold trims, glittery mules - all of my party outfits, shockingly, undeniably, could have belonged to Marc Bolan's (slightly less outr\u00e9) younger sister. </p> <p>This winter the glam influence has been particularly prominent, providing us with sartorial Prozac in the grey cold. After all, who cares about the weather when you're a vision of sparkles? Stand-out items include Clements Ribeiro's glittery striped top, Senzo's gold stiletto ankle boots and the plethora of dangly diamant\u00e9 earrings. All show the influence of 70s glam applied to more contemporary trends (stripes and ankle boots are very in, don't you know), stopping you looking like a walking anachronism or an extra from the Abba musical. </p> <p>The forthcoming release of the much hyped Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous, which is set in the 70s rock world, will perpetuate the look. This movie succeeds where many others have failed: it makes the 70s look good. It demonstrates, on the now ubiquitous Kate Hudson, that you can look sexily sparkly without resembling a wannabe five-year-old with a Claire's Accessories habit. </p> <p>Learn from the past masters on how to carry off glam with aplomb. Have a good rummage through Mum's old wardrobe for selected items. In the currently vintage-crazed fashion world, wearing the genuine article instead of a derivative copy is pretty much the style Holy Grail. </p> <p>Equally, glam clothes re-interpreted by today's young designers, such as PPQ and Preen, have a pleasingly cutting-edge bite to them. A fitted denim trench or boots in fake snakeskin, for example, show yesterday's timeless classics brushed with today's touch. Just as Kate Hudson looks like an updated, funkier Goldie Hawn, retro-influenced clothes need a similar touch. Remember, it's the best of glam we're after, not the 70s themselves. </p> <p>So dig out your mum's long satin dresses and tailored blouses, but leave her flares and platforms. Stardust without the Ziggy, if you will. To paraphrase Kim Basinger in LA Confidential, all girls need a little glamour in their lives. Glam - it's how I learnt to stop worrying and love the 70s.</p>",

      "bodyText": "OK, I admit it. I don't like the 70s. I hate the music, I hate the TV shows, I hate the flares. I even hate Bohemian Rhapsody. Or I thought I did until last month, during the party season, when I realised that the previously dreaded decade was actually the backbone of my wardrobe. Shiny satin panelling, gold trims, glittery mules - all of my party outfits, shockingly, undeniably, could have belonged to Marc Bolan's (slightly less outr\u00e9) younger sister. This winter the glam influence has been particularly prominent, providing us with sartorial Prozac in the grey cold. After all, who cares about the weather when you're a vision of sparkles? Stand-out items include Clements Ribeiro's glittery striped top, Senzo's gold stiletto ankle boots and the plethora of dangly diamant\u00e9 earrings. All show the influence of 70s glam applied to more contemporary trends (stripes and ankle boots are very in, don't you know), stopping you looking like a walking anachronism or an extra from the Abba musical. The forthcoming release of the much hyped Cameron Crowe film Almost Famous, which is set in the 70s rock world, will perpetuate the look. This movie succeeds where many others have failed: it makes the 70s look good. It demonstrates, on the now ubiquitous Kate Hudson, that you can look sexily sparkly without resembling a wannabe five-year-old with a Claire's Accessories habit. Learn from the past masters on how to carry off glam with aplomb. Have a good rummage through Mum's old wardrobe for selected items. In the currently vintage-crazed fashion world, wearing the genuine article instead of a derivative copy is pretty much the style Holy Grail. Equally, glam clothes re-interpreted by today's young designers, such as PPQ and Preen, have a pleasingly cutting-edge bite to them. A fitted denim trench or boots in fake snakeskin, for example, show yesterday's timeless classics brushed with today's touch. Just as Kate Hudson looks like an updated, funkier Goldie Hawn, retro-influenced clothes need a similar touch. Remember, it's the best of glam we're after, not the 70s themselves. So dig out your mum's long satin dresses and tailored blouses, but leave her flares and platforms. Stardust without the Ziggy, if you will. To paraphrase Kim Basinger in LA Confidential, all girls need a little glamour in their lives. Glam - it's how I learnt to stop worrying and love the 70s.",

In a heated exchange with Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, the son of Rupert Murdoch and NewsCorp board member savaged the licence fee as \"fundamentally wrong\". \"Expanding into commercial broadcasting is fundamentally the wrong thing to do with a licence fee. It is the wrong use of tax-payers money. Last year Mr Murdoch branded the licence fee as \"evil and draconian\". Mr Paxman asked Mr Murdoch if his comments were too strong, and under a barrage of questions the Star TV chief executive scaled down his criticism to \"not very good\". The BBC yesterday outlined its blueprint for the digital TV era with plans for five new TV services free for viewers. However, the corporation is also involved with commercial ventures such as UK Gold, which show repeats of its top shows such as EastEnders. The Murdoch family has a history of discord with the BBC, which began in earnest in 1989 when Rupert Murdoch attacked the corporation for its obsession with snooker and dramas marked by \"strangulated English accents\" designed to perpetuate rigid class structures. Mr Murdoch senior went on to say that there would never be a Watergate in Britain because BBC and ITV bosses and journalists were too scared of the \"thought police\". Last night Mr Paxman accused James Murdoch of chasing profits and not public interest broadcasting, with Murdoch agreeing that \"responsibilty to our shareholders\" was the main priority. When asked if broadcasting at News Corporation was about making profit, he said: \"Absolutely\". The head-to-head clash came to an end with Mr Murdoch repeatedly denying any interest in taking over from his father. \"It is not something that I concern myself with. We have a very strong senior management team and the board will make its decision.\" An incredulous Mr Paxman could not accept Mr Murdoch's sole priority was Star TV and not the line of succession to the NewsCorp throne, leading Mr Murdoch to state that he \"seriously\" did not think about taking over the family firm.",

      "body": "<p>An intricate and ambitious portrait of Britain at the end of a second-term Labour government has been drawn up by ministers and civil servants over the past six months. It covers every aspect of government, ranging from asylum policy and the extent to which inequality will be reduced, to the birthweight of newborn babies. </p> <p>In what will be seen as Labour's hidden manifesto for the general election, the government has set out more than 200 targets, backed in the last few weeks by a growing number of comprehensive agreements on how the targets are to be defined and delivered. </p> <p>Critics claim the preciseness of the targets will prove to be a big hostage to fortune. The furore over Labour's failure so far to meet two of its five election pledges underlines the political pitfalls of making measurable promises. Most of the targets are due to be met by 2004 or 2005, the likely date Labour will go to the polls seeking a third term. </p> <p><strong> Health </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Heart disease:</strong> Cut deaths from 69,000 in 1997 to 51,500 by 2005. </p> <p><strong> Cancer:</strong> Reduce deaths by 69,000 to 61,000 in 2005. </p> <p><strong> Suicides:</strong> Cut from 4,500 in 1997 to 4,000 in 2005. </p> <p><strong> Outpatients: </strong> By 2005, all appointments will be prebooked. </p> <p><strong> Waiting lists:</strong> By the end of 2005, maximum waiting time for outpatient appointments down to three months and for inpatient treatment to six months.

The level of compliance should be at least 75%. </p> <p><strong> Pensions:</strong> Reform second tier by 2004 so stakeholder pensions give more people access to good value funded second pensions. Access will be measured by surveys. </p> <p>Two million carers and 2m disabled people with broken work records have for the first time started to build up a second-tier pension. Fourteen million low and moderate earners have started to build up a better second-tier pension than would be possible under the old state earnings-related pension.

A baseline will be set in spring 2001. The cycle is judged to have started in mid-1999. </p> <p>The number of children in households with no one in work to be reduced. A baseline will be set in spring 2001 and progress monitored every six months </p> <p>Over the three years the relative employment rates of disadvantaged areas and groups should be increased taking account of the economic cycle. The pledge is aimed at people with disabilities, lone parents, ethnic minorities and the over-50s, as well the 30 local authority districts with the poorest initial labour market position. The baseline is spring 2001. </p> <p>The 30 districts are Hackney, Islington, Newham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets in London; City of Glasgow, Dundee, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire in Scotland; Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath, Pembrokeshire and Rhondda in Wales; Easington, Halton, Hartlepool, Hull, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, Salford, South Tyneside, Sunderland. </p> <p><strong> Environment and transport </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Air quality:</strong> Improvement should be made against seven indicators between 2003 and 2008 with a baseline of 1998.

It covers every aspect of government, ranging from asylum policy and the extent to which inequality will be reduced, to the birthweight of newborn babies. In what will be seen as Labour's hidden manifesto for the general election, the government has set out more than 200 targets, backed in the last few weeks by a growing number of comprehensive agreements on how the targets are to be defined and delivered. Critics claim the preciseness of the targets will prove to be a big hostage to fortune. The furore over Labour's failure so far to meet two of its five election pledges underlines the political pitfalls of making measurable promises. Most of the targets are due to be met by 2004 or 2005, the likely date Labour will go to the polls seeking a third term. Health Heart disease: Cut deaths from 69,000 in 1997 to 51,500 by 2005. Cancer: Reduce deaths by 69,000 to 61,000 in 2005. Suicides: Cut from 4,500 in 1997 to 4,000 in 2005. Outpatients: By 2005, all appointments will be prebooked. Waiting lists: By the end of 2005, maximum waiting time for outpatient appointments down to three months and for inpatient treatment to six months. Figures for third quarter of last year show 25% of patients are still waiting more than three months for an outpatient appointment and more than six months for inpatients. Community care: As many as 130,000 elderly people people to be helped in the community, rather than hospital. Crime Vehicle crime: Reduction of 30% by 2004 from the baseline of 1998-9.

Cut of 34.1% by 2004 in West Midlands; by 20% by 2005 in Greater Manchester; 15% by 2004 in Merseyside; 21.4% by 2004 in West Yorkshire. Robbery in England's big cities would fall by 14%. Fear of crime: By 2004, should be lower than levels to be recorded in the British Crime Survey in 2001. Cost of crime: A target, yet to be agreed, will be issued. The figure is currently estimated at \u00a360bn. Charges: By 2002, the number of recorded crimes brought to justice would be increased from the 1998-9 figure of 1,202,037 crimes cleared up out of 5,109,110.

September 2000 figures showed 75% had reached level 4 in English, up 4% on the previous year, and 72% had reached maths level 4 - up 3%. Figures in 1996 were 52% English, 54% maths. New targets will be set for 2004. No local education authority should have an, as yet unfixed, percentage of pupils failing to reach the new target. Key stage 3: By 2004, 80% should achieve level 5 or above in maths; 75% in English and IT; and 70% in science. Figures in September 2000 showed 65% reaching the level in maths (up 3%), 63% in English (down 1%) and 59% in science (up 4%). At least 65% of pupils in each education authority to reach this target in English and maths. GCSE: By 2004, 92% of pupils to obtain five or more GCSEs at grades A to G.

Children and poverty Child protection: By 2004, proportion of children aged 0-3 in 500 sure start areas who are re-registered on the child protection register within 12 months should fall by 20%. The measure is designed to see if emotional and social support is improving. No baseline has been established. Smoking: The number of mothers who smoke during pregnancy in sure start areas to fall by 10%. Baseline to be established in December 2002. Speech therapy: By 2004 number of children aged 0-3 with speech and language problems requiring specialist intervention will have fallen by 5 points. Baseline to be ready by December 2002. Target also to be prepared for the use of libraries by parents in sure start areas. Unemployment: By 2004, fewer children aged 0-3 in sure start areas will live in households where no one is working. Childminders: By 2002 a national register should be established and in the following year daycare providers to be inspected annually. Welfare Children: Number of children in low- income households to be reduced by a quarter by 2004. Households with incomes 60% or below the median to be covered. Baseline is 4.2m children in low-income households after housing costs and 3.1m before housing costs.Reform child support scheme for new cases by April 2002 so by the next year the accuracy rate for assessments and reviews is not less than 90%, with payment arrangements established on average within six weeks. The level of compliance should be at least 75%. Pensions: Reform second tier by 2004 so stakeholder pensions give more people access to good value funded second pensions. Access will be measured by surveys. Two million carers and 2m disabled people with broken work records have for the first time started to build up a second-tier pension. Fourteen million low and moderate earners have started to build up a better second-tier pension than would be possible under the old state earnings-related pension. Low and moderate earners are defined as anyone earning between \u00a33,432 and \u00a321,600. Benefits: By 2005 85% of claimants should have their benefits paid into bank accounts. The figure in October 2000 was 33%. Fraud and error in income support and jobseekers allowance should be reduced by 25% by March 2004. The baseline is \u00a31.38bn fraud and error in September 1998.

Acute care: By the end of 2004, the cost of acute care commissioned will have fallen to the level of the currently cheapest and best-performing trusts. Jobs and the economy Employment: Over the cycle, increase employment, defined as seasonally adjusted International Labour Organisation employment figure. A baseline will be set in spring 2001. The cycle is judged to have started in mid-1999. The number of children in households with no one in work to be reduced. A baseline will be set in spring 2001 and progress monitored every six months Over the three years the relative employment rates of disadvantaged areas and groups should be increased taking account of the economic cycle. The pledge is aimed at people with disabilities, lone parents, ethnic minorities and the over-50s, as well the 30 local authority districts with the poorest initial labour market position. The baseline is spring 2001. The 30 districts are Hackney, Islington, Newham, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets in London; City of Glasgow, Dundee, East Ayrshire, North Lanarkshire, and West Dunbartonshire in Scotland; Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath, Pembrokeshire and Rhondda in Wales; Easington, Halton, Hartlepool, Hull, Knowsley, Liverpool, Manchester, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Redcar and Cleveland, Salford, South Tyneside, Sunderland. Environment and transport Air quality: Improvement should be made against seven indicators between 2003 and 2008 with a baseline of 1998. By 2010 reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% from 1990 levels and move towards a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2010. Emissions in 2000 were already 13.5% below 1990 levels. With existing policies, UK emissions will be 15% below 1990 levels in 2010 and emissions of CO2 8.5% lower. Household waste: By 2004, 17% to be recycled or composted. Energy efficiency: Improvement in energy efficiency by 2004 in 600,000 homes so no more than 10% of household income is spent on fuel. Social housing: Between 2001 and 2004 the number of households living in social housing that does not meet decency standards should be cut by a third. Current estimate is that 29% of housing is not is in a decent state, with 43% in the 841 most deprived wards. Establish a new target for bringing abandoned houses back into use. By April 2002 reduce the number of people sleeping rough by two-thirds compared with June 1998 when 1,850 slept rough. Roads and rail: The government has still not established targets or a system of measurement for the reduction of traffic congestion in cities and trunk roads. Rail use should be increased by half by 2010, measured in passenger kilometres, at the same time as improvements in punctuality and reliability. The first milestone will be to increase mileage by 15% by 2001-2 compared with the 1999-2000 figure of 38.3bn passenger kms. The latest quarter showed mileage rose by 38.4 passenger kms. Buses: Bus use should rise by 10% from the 1999 level of 3.736 million passenger journeys. London Underground : Journey times should be cut, but no targets set. Countryside: By 2005 open up public access. By 2010 bring into favourable condition 95% of nationally important wildlife sites compared with the current 60% of sites. Housing: By 2008, 60% of new housing will be built on previously developed land or through conversion of existing buildings, up from 57% in 1998. By 2004 brownfield land will be reclaimed at a rate of over 1,100 hectares a year, with the result that 17% of brownfield land will be reclaimed by 2010. Last May ministers estimated that 57.710 hectares of British land was undeveloped. Local government: All local councils to have a new constitution by June 2002. Fire and traffic deaths: Cut number of people killed or seriously injured in accidents by 40% compared with the average for 1994-8, when 47,656 were killed or injured. By 2004-5 reduce by 15% the days lost from work-related ill-health or injury per 100,000 workers. As a result 3.5m fewer working days will be lost because of work-related ill-health or injury. By March 2004 reduce by 10% the number of building fires from a base line of 1998-9. By March 2004 annual accidental fire- related deaths will fall to 303 from the current 379. Culture By March 2004, introduce at least 12 creative partnerships targeted on deprived areas. Museums and galleries: By 2004 increase by a third the number of visits by children - a rise from 4.59m in 1999-2000 to 6m by 2003-4.

By 2002 ensure lowest cost access to the internet in Europe. Regions: By 2005 improve the economic performance of all regions measured by the trend in growth of each region's per capita GDP. Core indicator will be the regional variations on GDP. Energy: By 2004 ensure that gas and electricity prices are in the lower half of the EU average. By 2003 obtain 5% of UK electricity from renewable sources. Drugs Usage: Reduce the proportion of people aged 16-24 reporting the use of class A drugs in the last month by 25% by 2005, suggesting drug use will fall in the age group from 8.3% to 6.2%. Offending: By 2005, reduce the level of offending twice or more a month among crack- or heroin-using offenders aged over 17 by 25% by 2005 and by 50% by 2008. No baseline exists, but estimates suggest the target will apply to 15% of all people arrested. Treatment: Increase the participation of problem drug users in drug treatment programmes by 55% by 2004, by 66% by 2005, and by 100% by 2008. No baseline exists. Reduce the availability of class A drugs by 25% by 2005 and by 50% by 2008. Criminal justice Criminal courts: By 2004 reduce the time from charge to disposal of all defendants, first by dealing with 80% of youth court cases within their time targets. Guilty pleas to be dealt with in 70 days; not guilty pleas to be dealt with in 150 days; committals to be dealt with in 125 days. In addition, halve the time taken from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders from 142 days - the average for 1996 - to 71 days. This is one of the government's five key manifesto targets. Civil courts: Between 2001-4 increase the enforceability of civil judgments through a 10% increase in the amount recovered per pound under execu ed warrants in the county courts. Implement a new annual survey of satisfaction of users of the justice system. Food Health: Reduce food-borne illness by 20%. Salmonella in UK-produced farm chickens should be halved by the end of 2004-5. BSE should be reduced from 4,312 cases in 1997 to 650 by 2004, on track to 30 cases by 2006. Europe: Deal on common agricultural policy to be complete by March 2004. Fishing: Reduce fishing capacity by the end of 2001 by 20% from 1997 levels. BSE: By 2004, identify the latest offspring of suspect BSE cases and exclude them within two days of the case being reported.

Ministry of Defence Meet full manning requirements in March 2004 with RAF in 2001, navy in 2003 and army in 2005. Set new tour-of-duty limits and increase airlift capacity, as well as establish joint rapid reaction force. By 2005, ensure a minimum of 90% of rapidly available miliatry units at required state of readiness. Foreign Office Nuclear weapons: By March 2004, ensure 90% of the 38 remaining parties sign the comprehensive test ban treaty.

      "bodyText": "More than four years ago, Bill Clinton had a remarkable conversation with his rogue adviser Dick Morris. Their subject, as recorded in Morris's book, Behind the Oval Office, was one of Clinton's favourites - where he will rank in the history books when he leaves office. Morris took the initiative in the discussion. Eighteen of Clinton's predecessors deserved to be ranked in the top three categories, Morris suggested. The first rank of presidents was reserved for those who did great things in great times: Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. The second was for those who did great things but in less compelling eras: Jackson, Polk, Reagan (in Morris's view but not Clinton's), Theodore Roosevelt and Truman. In the third tier, reserved to presidents who did some great things but whose claim to higher rank is contestable for some important reason, Morris placed Madison, the two Johnsons, Arthur, Cleveland, Kennedy, Nixon and Bush. \"Good list,\" Clinton responded. \"Where do I fit in?\" \"Right now, to be honest, I think you are borderline third tier. It's too early to rank you yet, but you are right on the cusp of making third tier,\" Morris responded. \"I think that's about right,\" Clinton agreed. The president then asked Morris what he would need to do over the next four years in order to achieve second tier rank. Morris suggested three big things and four medium things. The big things were to make welfare reform work, to implement the balanced federal budget and to smash international terrorism. The medium things were to begin to eliminate cigarette smoking, to establish national standards in school education, to make further progress towards universal health care insurance, and to use the power of the presidency more emphatically on \"noneconomic lifestyle issues\". \"Good list,\" Clinton said, for the second time in the conversation. \"I've got it down. I'll think about it a lot.\" Four years on from that conversation, perhaps the most unexpected thing about it is how realistic it still seems, in spite of all that has happened in between. Clinton has, in fact, carried out much - though far from all - of Morris's agenda, and has notched up some other positive achievements too. Welfare reform has been far less painful in the years of plenty than most of its opponents claimed in 1996, although the truest test will come in times of hardship. The federal budget has been conclusively balanced, again on the back of taxes on prosperity and full employment, which have turned the years of deficit into years of surplus. Only the international terrorist agenda remains largely where it was four years ago. On the medium level agenda, the progress has been less obvious. The battle against big tobacco waxed and then waned, leaving Clinton unable to convert major interim victories into a conclusive ending. US education standards have risen in many respects, as several recent official and unofficial reports have indicated, but the overall picture still remains patchy. Health insurance reform remains a major area of failure, a challenge that the Bush administration will have to address even though it does not greatly want to. And Clinton's ability to use the presidential bully pulpit has of course been massively compromised by events since 1996. Most people would instinctively say that Clinton's second term has consisted of four years blighted by the Monica Lewinsky affair. Its shadow has lain heavy across the administration for the final year and a half that Clinton has remained in office. No president since Nixon leaves office so synonymous with a major scandal. And yet Clinton is also leaving office with precedent-defying job ratings. Even now, 65 per cent of Americans approve of the job he is doing (only just short of the peak of approval he reached in the month that the Starr Report was published). After eight years, his ratings exceed those of Reagan, a point that many Republicans cannot even bring themselves to think about. What is more, as he himself observed in a recent Rolling Stone interview, there is little doubt that Clinton would have stood for a third term, had the law allowed it, and equally little doubt that he would have easily been re-elected. In his final year as president, Bill Clinton achieved remarkably little to live in the memory or to bequeath to the history books. And yet Clinton remains in some strange but important way the absolutely defining figure of modern America.

      "bodyText": "Chris Evans' infamous on-air tirades against his BBC bosses and celebrities when he was hosting the Radio 1 breakfast show have been wiped from the archives for ever. It means that the BBC have no record of what turned out to be the most controversial breakfast show of the station's history. The absence of audio tapes of the show from the archives emerged this week after a BBC2 doucmentary about former Radio 1 boss Matthew Bannister. Although it centred on the shake-up at Radio 1, the departure of veteran DJs such as Dave Lee Travis and the arrival of Chris Evans, there were no audio clips on the show. Blood on the Carpet series producer Nick Mirsky said he was simply told none existed. A spokesman for Radio 1 said: \"Chris Evans' show was an independently produced show and we only have a selection of shows in the archive. But no, we don't have all those famous Evans tantrums in the archive.\" Not all radio shows are held in the BBC library and Radio 1 pop shows don't usually lend themselves to archiving. However, the BBC documentary about Mr Bannister and his head of music Trevor Dann did feature a clip of Dave Lee Travis resigning, just before Evans' arrival in 1995. \"It is amazing that we can find DLT but we don't have Evans on tape. I guess some of Chris' outbursts are best forgotten,\" said a BBC source. By the end of his 19 months at the station, Evans had developed a huge ego and was virtually out of control. But his outbursts are destined for radio oblivion. Among those that will never be aired again are his hurtful attacks on celebrities. He branded Anthea Turner's TV show All You Need is Love \"a pile of poo\"; said Jimmy Hill was \"a poof\" and described children's TV host Emma Forbes \"a nightmare\". Evans continually referred to then Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister as the \"fat controller\" and kept his listeners informed of all the ins and outs of their rows and contract negotiations. In October 1996, after another reprimand from Mr Bannister over a broadcast deemed to have breached bounds of taste, Mr Evans branded him \"ungrateful\", adding \"we saved his job because, frankly, before we joined [Radio 1] he was slipping down the banister\". Other inflammatory on-air comments included telling breakfast show listeners he \"loathed\" Radio 1 production head Trevor Dann for making his job \"difficult\". None of these on-air tirades was included in Walking with Disc Jockeys, according to Mr Mirsky, because both the BBC and the Virgin Media Group - which now owns Ginger, the company that produced Mr Evans' Radio 1 breakfast show - said the recordings no longer existed. \"We contacted Virgin and they said they didn't have anything,\" he added. \"The BBC has a selection of recordings from that time, but not what we were looking for.\" Commercial radio stations are obliged to keep all their broadcast output for 60 days under Radio Authority rules. A Virgin spokesman said recordings from that period were kept on analogue audio tapes that took up considerable storage space and radio stations tended not to keep them. He added: \"I very, very much doubt whether these audio tapes still exist.\" \"Maybe some producer has them stacked up in his garage somewhere and you can find him,\" the spokesman added.",

      "body": "<p>With his macho-man moustache, his derisive grin and his wobbling knees, Bruce Grobbelaar went through the 1980s as the pantomime villain of big-time football. While he and his Liverpool team mates were mopping up six league championships in nine years, the Zimbabwean became the green-shirted destroyer of other men's dreams, a goalkeeper whose antics concealed a tradecraft and a courage that provided the foundation for a decade of almost unbroken success. </p> <p>Grobbelaar's name came up a few days ago, when Liverpool were drawn to meet Roma in the next round of this year's Uefa Cup. Commentators instantly evoked memories of the night, 17 years ago, when the two clubs met in Rome's Olympic stadium in the final of the European Cup, Liverpool leaving as champions after winning an agonising penalty shoot-out. Grobbelaar was at his best on such occasions, his earlier service as a scout in the Rhodesian army, tracking the movements and dodging the bullets of Robert Mugabe's guerrilla fighters, being popularly supposed to have enabled him put mere penalty kicks with plastic-coated footballs into proper perspective. </p> <p>Yet if Grobbelaar was vital to the triumphs of Liverpool's greatest era, so he was also present on its most tragic occasions: the night in the Heysel stadium when 40 Italian fans were crushed to death before the start of the 1985 European Cup final, just as the team were preparing to defend the title they had won for the fourth time the previous year; and the spring afternoon at Hillsborough in Sheffield four years later when 94 of the Anfield club's supporters suffered a similar fate before an FA Cup semi-final. </p> <p>Like his team mates, the usually flamboyant Grobbelaar conducted himself through those dark days with notable sensitivity and decorum. But his conduct was not always so admirable. His body check on the hobbling Gordon McQueen of Manchester United in the last minute of normal time in the 1983 League Cup final, the sort of thing known in the game as a \"professional foul\", was thought to be the worst of its kind since Toni Schumacher of West Germany crashed into Patrick Battiston of France in the 1982 World Cup semi-final - but it kept Liverpool in the game. Instead of being sent off, as he deserved, Grobbelaar was still on the pitch to see his team win 2-1 after extra time. It was an ungallant victory and unworthy of the club's distinguished manager, Bob Paisley, who was taking them to a Wembley final for the last time. </p> <p>In Rome the following year his decision to disturb the concentration of Francesco Graziani during the penalty shoot-out probably won Liverpool the European Cup for the fourth time. By wobbling his knees on the goal line in a parody of stark terror as the veteran striker prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar seemed to provoke the Italian into a wild miss. Alan Kennedy, the Liverpool full back, needed only to succeed with the next kick to secure the trophy for the English champions. But Grobbelaar's action, although effective and to some extent amusing, undeniably contravened any definition of sporting etiquette. </p> <p>When Grobbelaar's powers eventually declined, so did Liverpool's. At 34, after 12 years with the club, his departure from Anfield coincided with the rise of Manchester United, who usurped Liverpool's pre-eminence and established their own hegemonic control of the top level of English football. His relationships with his team mates may not have been uniformly cordial; several years later, at least one refused to appear as a character witness at his trial. </p> <p>Barely a year after removing his kit from the Liverpool boot room for the last time, Grobbelaar became the central figure in a scandal concerning allegations of match fixing. Soon there were \"love rat\" revelations in the News of the World, made by a Zimbabwean barmaid and a \"leggy Liverpool fan\", both of whom dressed up in replica goalkeeping kit for the photographs accompanying the story. But the match-rigging affair, involving Far East betting rings and Grobbelaar's business partner, looked as though it might shake the game to its foundations. Now, following the appeal court's reversal of the verdict in Grobbelaar's libel action against the Sun, it threatens to do so again - particularly in a climate in which, after the Hanse Cronje story, the public no longer clings to a naive belief in the natural probity of sports stars. </p> <p>Ironically enough, while Grobbelaar's lawyers have been doing battle with Rupert Murdoch's representatives, the former goalkeeper has been earning his living in South Africa, coaching a league team called Supersport United. The club, formerly known as Pretoria City, rechristened itself after it was purchased by MNET, a cable TV network whose Supersports channel carries Rupert Murdoch's Sky Sports programmes in South Africa. His time there has represented something of a return to his roots. Although he is a Zimbabwean, his grandfather was born in Cape Castle at Cape Town, a British stronghold during the Boer war, during which his great-grandfather was a fusilier in the British army. Grobbelaar himself was born in Durban in 1957. </p> <p>After his service with the Rhodesian African Rifles in the war of liberation he made his way to Canada, where he played for Vancouver Whitecaps in the old North American Soccer League. He had ambitions to play in England, however, and after a brief loan period with Crewe Alexandra (for whom, curiously, he scored his only league goal) in 1979-80 he was bought by Paisley for Liverpool for a fee of \u00a3250,000. He was 22 when he arrived on Merseyside and his chance was not long in coming. At the start of the 1981-82 season he made what was to be the first of 627 first-team appearances for the club. For his first five seasons, in fact, he missed not a single league match as a member of a team graced by such great players as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen, Mark Lawrenson, Graham Souness and John Barnes. Eventually he was earning around \u00a34,000 a week - a top wage for the era - and living with his wife, Debbie, a former air stewardess, and their daughters, Tahli and Olivia, in a \u00a3250,000 house on the Wirral. </p> <p>His spell at Anfield, where he also won three FA Cup winner's medals, represented Grobbelaar's only extended sojourn at any football club. After his departure in 1993, following his refusal of a one-year contract which he described as \"an insult\" and \"like a slap in the face\", his curriculum vitae over the remaining six years of his playing career reads like an extended plunge into the nether regions of English football. A loan period at Stoke City was followed by spells at Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Oldham Athletic, Oxford United (where he lasted less than a week), Sheffield Wednesday (another loan period, shortly after he was found not guilty of all charges in the retrial of the match-rigging case), Oldham Athletic, Chesham United (for whom he turned out in a 7-1 victory over Brackley in the Ryman League in August 1998, in front of a crowd of 100), Bury, Lincoln City (who released him two days before Christmas 1998), and, finally, Northwich Victoria, another non-league side, where he was signed in October 1999 as a non-contract player to provide temporary cover for their suspended regular goalkeeper. </p> <p>So far behind football's front line had Grobbelaar fallen that in 1998 he had been offering his services to Northern Spirit, an Australian league team. Spirit's manager, however, rejected the 40-year-old former European champion, preferring instead to buy Zeljko Kalac, the No 2 goalkeeper for Australia. </p> <p>While his libel action took its course, Grobbelaar returned to South Africa. His first port of call was Cape Town, where he took on the management of Seven Stars, a club then shortly to be amalgamated with their local rivals, Spurs, to form a new outfit called Ajax Cape Town, with a majority shareholding in the hands of Ajax Amsterdam for whom the club would act as a nursery for talented young players. </p> <p>Grobbelaar's reign did not survive the merger, however, and instead he moved north, to take over Supersports United, formerly managed by Terry Paine, the ex-Southampton winger. The team currently lie eighth in South Africa's premiership, having won seven, drawn nine and lost five of their matches so far this season. They are not an easy touch: in 21 games they have scored 23 goals and conceded only 18. </p> <p> 'When Grobbelaar arrived, the team were doing very badly,\" says Julia Beffon, sports editor of the Johannesburg Mail and Guardian. \"He turned them around, and got them out of the relegation zone at the end of last season. In that sense he was certainly a success. But since then he doesn't seem to have been able to take them forward. He's quite well thought of, but he certainly isn't one of the top coaches here.\" </p> <p>His main problem has its origins in South Africa's history. Supersports United was formed from an amalgamation of two of the city's white clubs, Pretoria City and Arcadia Shepherds. Nowadays the playing staff is almost totally black, but the club suffer by comparison with their local rivals, Mamelodi Sundowns, who have their roots in the townships. Less than an hour down the highway, the Sowetan giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates - the Liverpool and Manchester United of South African football - also exert a greater appeal to talented young players. \"They've been trying hard to get into the schools to attract young players,\" says Beffon, \"but they're not one of the glamour clubs. There's too much competition.\" Thanks to MNET, money is not a problem - although Grobbelaar is believed to earn no more than about 20,000 rand (\u00a32,000) a month. </p> <p>Tomorrow night in the Caledonian Stadium, the former home of Arcadia Shepherds, the former hero of Anfield's Spion Kop will watch as his team, the team named after a cable TV channel, take on Santos, a team from Cape Town named after the Brazilian club that nurtured Pele, the international symbol of all that is pure and admirable about football - the man, indeed, who called it \"the beautiful game\". </p> <p>\"My ambition,\" Grobbelaar told Simon Kuper of the Observer almost two years ago, \"is to manage Liverpool.\" Until yesterday, he might even have believed it possible. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

He had ambitions to play in England, however, and after a brief loan period with Crewe Alexandra (for whom, curiously, he scored his only league goal) in 1979-80 he was bought by Paisley for Liverpool for a fee of \u00a3250,000. He was 22 when he arrived on Merseyside and his chance was not long in coming. At the start of the 1981-82 season he made what was to be the first of 627 first-team appearances for the club. For his first five seasons, in fact, he missed not a single league match as a member of a team graced by such great players as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen, Mark Lawrenson, Graham Souness and John Barnes. Eventually he was earning around \u00a34,000 a week - a top wage for the era - and living with his wife, Debbie, a former air stewardess, and their daughters, Tahli and Olivia, in a \u00a3250,000 house on the Wirral. His spell at Anfield, where he also won three FA Cup winner's medals, represented Grobbelaar's only extended sojourn at any football club. After his departure in 1993, following his refusal of a one-year contract which he described as \"an insult\" and \"like a slap in the face\", his curriculum vitae over the remaining six years of his playing career reads like an extended plunge into the nether regions of English football. A loan period at Stoke City was followed by spells at Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Oldham Athletic, Oxford United (where he lasted less than a week), Sheffield Wednesday (another loan period, shortly after he was found not guilty of all charges in the retrial of the match-rigging case), Oldham Athletic, Chesham United (for whom he turned out in a 7-1 victory over Brackley in the Ryman League in August 1998, in front of a crowd of 100), Bury, Lincoln City (who released him two days before Christmas 1998), and, finally, Northwich Victoria, another non-league side, where he was signed in October 1999 as a non-contract player to provide temporary cover for their suspended regular goalkeeper. So far behind football's front line had Grobbelaar fallen that in 1998 he had been offering his services to Northern Spirit, an Australian league team. Spirit's manager, however, rejected the 40-year-old former European champion, preferring instead to buy Zeljko Kalac, the No 2 goalkeeper for Australia. While his libel action took its course, Grobbelaar returned to South Africa. His first port of call was Cape Town, where he took on the management of Seven Stars, a club then shortly to be amalgamated with their local rivals, Spurs, to form a new outfit called Ajax Cape Town, with a majority shareholding in the hands of Ajax Amsterdam for whom the club would act as a nursery for talented young players. Grobbelaar's reign did not survive the merger, however, and instead he moved north, to take over Supersports United, formerly managed by Terry Paine, the ex-Southampton winger. The team currently lie eighth in South Africa's premiership, having won seven, drawn nine and lost five of their matches so far this season. They are not an easy touch: in 21 games they have scored 23 goals and conceded only 18. 'When Grobbelaar arrived, the team were doing very badly,\" says Julia Beffon, sports editor of the Johannesburg Mail and Guardian. \"He turned them around, and got them out of the relegation zone at the end of last season. In that sense he was certainly a success. But since then he doesn't seem to have been able to take them forward. He's quite well thought of, but he certainly isn't one of the top coaches here.\" His main problem has its origins in South Africa's history. Supersports United was formed from an amalgamation of two of the city's white clubs, Pretoria City and Arcadia Shepherds. Nowadays the playing staff is almost totally black, but the club suffer by comparison with their local rivals, Mamelodi Sundowns, who have their roots in the townships. Less than an hour down the highway, the Sowetan giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates - the Liverpool and Manchester United of South African football - also exert a greater appeal to talented young players. \"They've been trying hard to get into the schools to attract young players,\" says Beffon, \"but they're not one of the glamour clubs. There's too much competition.\" Thanks to MNET, money is not a problem - although Grobbelaar is believed to earn no more than about 20,000 rand (\u00a32,000) a month. Tomorrow night in the Caledonian Stadium, the former home of Arcadia Shepherds, the former hero of Anfield's Spion Kop will watch as his team, the team named after a cable TV channel, take on Santos, a team from Cape Town named after the Brazilian club that nurtured Pele, the international symbol of all that is pure and admirable about football - the man, indeed, who called it \"the beautiful game\". \"My ambition,\" Grobbelaar told Simon Kuper of the Observer almost two years ago, \"is to manage Liverpool.\" Until yesterday, he might even have believed it possible. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>When Bruce Grobbelaar strolled into a Southampton hotel room, warmly embraced his friend Chris Vincent and slouched in an armchair with a cigarette in his hand, the talk was of bedding women, their days in the Zimbabwean army and throwing football matches. </p> <p>Unknown to Grobbelaar, who made his name at Liverpool and earned the nickname \"the crown prince of goalkeepers\" for his zany antics, the Sun newspaper had installed secret recording equipment in the hotel room after a tip-off from Vincent that Grobbelaar was involved in accepting bribes for throwing matches. </p> <p>For those who saw the video tapes during the two criminal trials involving Grobbelaar and his initial libel trial against the Sun in 1999, the evidence was compelling and threatened to tarnish the entire reputation of English football. Accused alongside Grobbelaar, who was playing for Southampton when he was secretly recorded in October 1994, were Wimbledon players John Fashanu and Hans Segers. </p> <p>During the recordings, Grobbelaar talked about throwing at least three games and trying to throw others. For one, between Liverpool and Newcastle United in 1993, the Liverpool player told Vincent that he received \u00a340,000 from a betting syndicate. He joked that he missed out on making substantial money in another match, against Manchester City because he accidentally saved the ball. </p> <p>In a match against Coventry City in September 1994, which Southampton, Grobbelaar's team at the time, won 3-1, Grobbelaar told Vincent he had stood to make a small fortune if his team had lost 1-0 and that he deliberately pushed the ball into the back of the net to concede the first goal. </p> <p>Following another accidental save against Manchester United, also in 1994, Grobbelaar told Vincent: \"I dived the wrong way and it fucking hit my hand. </p> <p>\"In the Man Utd game do you know how much I lost? A hundred and twenty-five fucking thousand pounds in cash.\" </p> <p>Vincent and Grobbelaar were former business partners who were involved in a failed safari tours business in their native Zimbabwe. The two were distant acquaintances but their friendship blossomed in 1989 when Vincent arrived in England because of their shared Zimbabwean background, love of nightlife and chasing women. </p> <p>Vincent had a string of failed businesses to his name and was declared bankrupt in the early 1990s with debts of \u00a390,000. Grobbelaar openly spoke to his friend about match fixing and for Vincent, selling the story to the Sun offered the chance to solve his financial problems. It later emerged that Vincent received \u00a333,000 for his story and stood to make even more if Grobbelaar had been convicted during the two criminal trials at Winchester crown court in 1997. </p> <p>During the secretly taped conversations in the Southampton hotel room, which were compiled over a period of weeks, Vincent asked Grobbelaar if he would be interested in throwing football matches in return for money. </p> <p>Grobbelaar is filmed by the Sun accepting \u00a32,000 as part of a down payment. He is also recorded outlining plans to throw the Southampton v Liverpool match to be played at the end of the 1994-95 football season in return for \u00a3134,000. </p> <p>Vincent was recorded telling Grobbelaar that he would receive \u00a32,000 every fortnight until the end of the football season, and \u00a3100,000 after any match he managed to fix. </p> <p>The Sun's expos\u00e9 of Grobbelaar's alleged involvement in match fixing appeared in November 1994. From the moment the goalkeeper was approached by Sun journalists at Gatwick airport as he made his way to Zimbabwe for an international match, he has protested his innocence. </p> <p>Yesterday marked the first time in the protracted legal saga, which has so far involved two criminal cases, a 16-day libel trial and an appeal against the libel trial verdict, that a judge has cast doubt on Grobbelaar's innocence. </p> <p>The Sun handed its evidence to the police and, implicated alongside Grobbelaar, was Fashanu, Segers and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim, who it was alleged acted as the middleman between the footballers and a far eastern betting ring. </p> <p>Within weeks of the police receiving the Sun's evidence, charges were laid against the footballers and Lim. Football's trial of the century began in January 1997. </p> <p>Two months later - and with all those charged protesting their innocence - the jury found itself unable to reach a verdict. A re-trial was ordered and all were cleared by the end of the year. </p> <p>After the criminal trials, Vincent returned to Zimbabwe and has not been heard of since. If Grobbelaar had been found guilty, Vincent planned to publish a book on the affair and had already agreed a \u00a3100,000 deal with publishers. </p> <p>While Segers and Fashanu opted not to pursue the match-fixing allegations any further, Grobbelaar decided to sue the Sun for libel. In July 1999, following a 16-day hearing at the high court, and much to the amazement of those present, Grobbelaar was awarded \u00a385,000 and walked out of court with his reputation intact; for the time being at least. </p> <p>Grobbelaar's victories in the libel trial and the two criminal trials were as audacious as any of his performances in a Liverpool shirt. Three times he had managed to convince a jury that despite being caught on camera talking about match fixing, accepting \u00a32,000 and plotting to throw other matches, he was in fact the innocent party and was instead trying to entrap Vincent. </p> <p>Grobbelaar has alleged throughout the past six years that he always intended to return the \u00a32,000 he was caught on camera accepting and that he intended to report match fixing to the authorities. He claimed that the match against Manchester United, when he talks about accidentally making a save, and other references he made to throwing matches were a tissue of lies, designed to entrap Vincent so that he could obtain more information and then go to the police. </p> <p>Two juries believed him, one could not make up its mind. Yesterday, three judges at the court of appeal decided Grobbelaar was a corrupt, not innocent, man. </p> <p><strong>The Matches</strong></p> <p><strong> November 1993 Newcastle United 3 Liverpool 0</strong> Andy Cole scored a hat trick in the match within the opening half-hour. Grobbelaar was accused of taking \u00a340,000 to throw the match. Video replays of the goals he conceded were shown in court but experts , including former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson, claimed there was little Grobbelaar could have done to stop the goals. For one goal, the ball slipped through Grobbelaar's legs </p> <p><strong> September 1994 Southampton 3 Coventry 1 </strong> Grobbelaar is recorded as saying that he would have \"cleared up\" if Southampton had lost 1-0. He also says on tape that he pushed the ball into the back of the net after just two minutes to ensure Southampton would concede an early goal. Once again, expert witnesses claimed that there was nothing suspicious </p> <p><strong> November 1994 Manchester City 3 Southampton 3 </strong> Grobbelaar declares on tape that he was promised \u00a350,000 if he helped Southampton lose by one goal. His team were 1-0 up but experts again said little could have been done to prevent Grobbelaar conceding the goals by Manchester City. Former Southampton manager Alan Ball, giving evidence on behalf of Grobbelaar during the Sun libel trial, said he thought it would be impossible for a goalkeeper to throw a match </p> <p><strong>The Players</strong></p> <p><strong> John Fashanu</strong> Fashanu, 37, was raised in a Barnado's home and has enjoyed a successful career in politics, business and entertainment since retiring from football. His aggressive style earned him the nickname Fash the Bash. </p> <p>He won the FA Cup as captain of Wimbledon and at one stage was worth \u00a36m. He joined Aston Villa but retired from football in 1996 with a knee injury. </p> <p>Fashanu has amassed a fortune working in Africa where he has acted as a middleman in business deals. He has also been helping African footballers to find clubs in Europe and was closely involved in South Africa's failed bid to secure the 2006 world cup. </p> <p>His Nigerian origins have made him popular with politicians in the country and in 1997 he was one of seven sports ambassadors named by Nigeria. In 1995 he married Melissa, the daughter of an African politician. </p> <p>Fashanu is the brother of former Norwich City and Nottingham Forest striker Justin Fashanu, who committed suicide after he revealed that he was a homosexual. </p> <p><strong> Hans Segers</strong> A Dutch-born goalkeeper, Segers was signed to Nottingham Forest by Brian Clough in 1984. He joined Wimbledon in 1988, becoming a member of the Crazy Gang - as the team was known because of its antics on and off the pitch. </p> <p>Segers made Britain his home and is involved in a number of business ventures financed by money he has made from football. Following the end of the second criminal trial in 1997, he rejoined Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he was reserve team goalkeeper. </p> <p>He is currently goalkeeping coach at Tottenham Hotspur and is still registered with the Football Association as a player. </p> <p>He could be on the substitutes' bench tomorrow for Tottenham's home match against Southampton. </p> <p>Segers, 39, was accused of being involved in match fixing and specifically charged with accepting \u00a319,000 from John Fashanu. </p> <p>Segers was cleared of match fixing at the second Winchester crown court trial in August 1997. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Grobbelaar openly spoke to his friend about match fixing and for Vincent, selling the story to the Sun offered the chance to solve his financial problems. It later emerged that Vincent received \u00a333,000 for his story and stood to make even more if Grobbelaar had been convicted during the two criminal trials at Winchester crown court in 1997. During the secretly taped conversations in the Southampton hotel room, which were compiled over a period of weeks, Vincent asked Grobbelaar if he would be interested in throwing football matches in return for money. Grobbelaar is filmed by the Sun accepting \u00a32,000 as part of a down payment. He is also recorded outlining plans to throw the Southampton v Liverpool match to be played at the end of the 1994-95 football season in return for \u00a3134,000. Vincent was recorded telling Grobbelaar that he would receive \u00a32,000 every fortnight until the end of the football season, and \u00a3100,000 after any match he managed to fix. The Sun's expos\u00e9 of Grobbelaar's alleged involvement in match fixing appeared in November 1994. From the moment the goalkeeper was approached by Sun journalists at Gatwick airport as he made his way to Zimbabwe for an international match, he has protested his innocence. Yesterday marked the first time in the protracted legal saga, which has so far involved two criminal cases, a 16-day libel trial and an appeal against the libel trial verdict, that a judge has cast doubt on Grobbelaar's innocence. The Sun handed its evidence to the police and, implicated alongside Grobbelaar, was Fashanu, Segers and Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim, who it was alleged acted as the middleman between the footballers and a far eastern betting ring. Within weeks of the police receiving the Sun's evidence, charges were laid against the footballers and Lim. Football's trial of the century began in January 1997. Two months later - and with all those charged protesting their innocence - the jury found itself unable to reach a verdict. A re-trial was ordered and all were cleared by the end of the year. After the criminal trials, Vincent returned to Zimbabwe and has not been heard of since. If Grobbelaar had been found guilty, Vincent planned to publish a book on the affair and had already agreed a \u00a3100,000 deal with publishers. While Segers and Fashanu opted not to pursue the match-fixing allegations any further, Grobbelaar decided to sue the Sun for libel. In July 1999, following a 16-day hearing at the high court, and much to the amazement of those present, Grobbelaar was awarded \u00a385,000 and walked out of court with his reputation intact; for the time being at least. Grobbelaar's victories in the libel trial and the two criminal trials were as audacious as any of his performances in a Liverpool shirt. Three times he had managed to convince a jury that despite being caught on camera talking about match fixing, accepting \u00a32,000 and plotting to throw other matches, he was in fact the innocent party and was instead trying to entrap Vincent. Grobbelaar has alleged throughout the past six years that he always intended to return the \u00a32,000 he was caught on camera accepting and that he intended to report match fixing to the authorities. He claimed that the match against Manchester United, when he talks about accidentally making a save, and other references he made to throwing matches were a tissue of lies, designed to entrap Vincent so that he could obtain more information and then go to the police. Two juries believed him, one could not make up its mind. Yesterday, three judges at the court of appeal decided Grobbelaar was a corrupt, not innocent, man. The Matches November 1993 Newcastle United 3 Liverpool 0 Andy Cole scored a hat trick in the match within the opening half-hour. Grobbelaar was accused of taking \u00a340,000 to throw the match. Video replays of the goals he conceded were shown in court but experts , including former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson, claimed there was little Grobbelaar could have done to stop the goals. For one goal, the ball slipped through Grobbelaar's legs September 1994 Southampton 3 Coventry 1 Grobbelaar is recorded as saying that he would have \"cleared up\" if Southampton had lost 1-0. He also says on tape that he pushed the ball into the back of the net after just two minutes to ensure Southampton would concede an early goal. Once again, expert witnesses claimed that there was nothing suspicious November 1994 Manchester City 3 Southampton 3 Grobbelaar declares on tape that he was promised \u00a350,000 if he helped Southampton lose by one goal. His team were 1-0 up but experts again said little could have been done to prevent Grobbelaar conceding the goals by Manchester City. Former Southampton manager Alan Ball, giving evidence on behalf of Grobbelaar during the Sun libel trial, said he thought it would be impossible for a goalkeeper to throw a match The Players John Fashanu Fashanu, 37, was raised in a Barnado's home and has enjoyed a successful career in politics, business and entertainment since retiring from football. His aggressive style earned him the nickname Fash the Bash. He won the FA Cup as captain of Wimbledon and at one stage was worth \u00a36m. He joined Aston Villa but retired from football in 1996 with a knee injury. Fashanu has amassed a fortune working in Africa where he has acted as a middleman in business deals. He has also been helping African footballers to find clubs in Europe and was closely involved in South Africa's failed bid to secure the 2006 world cup. His Nigerian origins have made him popular with politicians in the country and in 1997 he was one of seven sports ambassadors named by Nigeria. In 1995 he married Melissa, the daughter of an African politician. Fashanu is the brother of former Norwich City and Nottingham Forest striker Justin Fashanu, who committed suicide after he revealed that he was a homosexual. Hans Segers A Dutch-born goalkeeper, Segers was signed to Nottingham Forest by Brian Clough in 1984. He joined Wimbledon in 1988, becoming a member of the Crazy Gang - as the team was known because of its antics on and off the pitch. Segers made Britain his home and is involved in a number of business ventures financed by money he has made from football. Following the end of the second criminal trial in 1997, he rejoined Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he was reserve team goalkeeper. He is currently goalkeeping coach at Tottenham Hotspur and is still registered with the Football Association as a player. He could be on the substitutes' bench tomorrow for Tottenham's home match against Southampton. Segers, 39, was accused of being involved in match fixing and specifically charged with accepting \u00a319,000 from John Fashanu. Segers was cleared of match fixing at the second Winchester crown court trial in August 1997. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

However, while the Business Objects deal is undoubtedly welcome news, even house broker Deutsche Bank admitted it was \"not yet in the class of the likes of Seibel, SAP or Oracle\". </p> <p>More pessimistic still was yesterday's inaugural note on Autonomy from Merrill Lynch. \"Despite the 30% fall in the share price from its highs in November, we find the stock fairly valued at current levels,\" it said. </p> <p>Merrill believes the company is relying on signing up partners in a market which is rapidly attracting competitors offering similar technology.

      "bodyText": "Mike Lynch, the founder and chief executive of software developer Autonomy, has stepped up his efforts to persuade investors that his Cambridge-based firm will avoid the slowdown in trade facing technology businesses. Announcing a licencing deal with Franco-American software firm Business Objects yesterday, he said Autonomy would continue to rely on an increasing number of alliances to place its core technology - data sorting software - across the world. The statement was designed to answer growing City concerns that Autonomy had not been securing the hoped-for number of heavyweight partners. Yesterday, the market seemed more than willing to swallow Mr Lynch's upbeat statement, sending Autonomy shares up 170p to \u00a321.85 at the close. However, while the Business Objects deal is undoubtedly welcome news, even house broker Deutsche Bank admitted it was \"not yet in the class of the likes of Seibel, SAP or Oracle\". More pessimistic still was yesterday's inaugural note on Autonomy from Merrill Lynch. \"Despite the 30% fall in the share price from its highs in November, we find the stock fairly valued at current levels,\" it said. Merrill believes the company is relying on signing up partners in a market which is rapidly attracting competitors offering similar technology. It is already fighting hard over some partnership deals with its rival, Verity. As well as increased competition, Autonomy must also weather a slowdown in IT spending that is beginning to hurt many software firms. But Mr Lynch insists that companies needing to trim costs are likely to spend more on Autonomy software, which automates otherwise labour intensive tasks. It is an argument the analysts are signing up to. In the meantime, Autonomy remains one of the great hopes of the British software industry, but its rise to the status of global giant is far from guaranteed.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is trying to restrict the terms of a constitutional debate about the future of the European Union and head off Tory attacks in the run-up to the general election. Diplomats say the government is resisting calls by the European commission and member states for an early launch of substantive talks on the items agreed at last month's Nice summit. Tony Blair wants Sweden, where the prime minister, Goran Persson, also faces popular Euroscepticism, to set the all-important tone for the talks during its EU presidency, rather than leave that to the integrationist Belgians when they take over in July. \"It'll be a disaster if the Belgians get their hands on it,\" one well-placed source warned. Belgium's prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, was an angry critic of the Nice treaty, accusing big countries of selfishly pursuing their own interests in bitter and undemocratic haggling over national vetoes and voting weights. Mr Verhofstadt, who speaks openly of the need for an EU constitution, wants far wider popular consultation now to prevent that horse-trading. Robin Cook and other foreign ministers will discuss this sensitive issue in Brussels on Monday, when their Swedish colleague, Anna Lindh, will outline her approach. Romano Prodi, the president of the commission, told the European parliament on Wednesday that he wanted a more ambitious \"fundamental review\" to go far beyond what was agreed by Mr Blair and other leaders at the summit. Nice called for a \"deeper and wider debate about \"future [EU] development\" and a new intergovernmental conference (IGC) to negotiate changes in 2004, by which time countries such as Poland and Slovenia may be ready to join. Britain, anxious to give a high priority to the enlargement process, wants the next two years spent on public consultation and opposes moving prematurely to talks on issues that are bound to inflame Eurosceptic opinion. But Mr Blair is strongly against the use of a convention, the 62-member body of MPs, MEPs and government representatives created to draw up the EU's charter of fundamental rights.\"It has to be something that has more impact on public opinion,\" said one British official. Britain insisted that the charter - seen by some supporters as an embryonic EU constitution - must not contain any new social and economic rights and must not be legally binding, although several members want it incorporated into a new treaty. Finland and the Benelux countries want the Nice agenda discussed by another convention. But Sweden, crucially, backs the British position that this is too narrow a forum to fully reflect public opinion and too broad to reflect government concerns. Only governments decide the agenda for IGCs and negotiate treaty changes. Mr Blair's agreement to a new IGC was crucial to the alliance he forged with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der at Nice. Under the Nice plan, Sweden is to report on progress at the Gothenburg summit in June. In December, Belgium is to issue a declaration on how to carry on. Nice said discussions should include \"a more precise delimitation of competencies between the EU and member states\"; the status of the charter of rights; simplification of EU treaties to make them better understood without changing their meaning; and \"the role of national parliaments in the European architecture\". Mr Prodi, deeply disappointed by the summit's outcome, said, however, that focusing on these four points alone would be \"obviously the worst way of going about it\".",

Mr Falcone, a senior adviser and middleman for Sofremi, the controversial \"security equipment\" export company run by the French interior ministry, was arrested last month on suspicion of organising the illegal sale of more than \u00a3300m-worth of weapons to Angola in the early 1990s.

Cameroon was engaged in a border dispute with Nigeria at the time - in which Paris was officially neutral, and which was being debated by the United Nations security council, then chaired by France, even as the exchange of letters got under way.

In all this Naumann is a true Nato soldier, his eye as much on the divisions that constantly threaten to render military capacity useless as on any potential enemy. Certainly, in its 50 years of confrontation with the Soviet Union, Nato had no battles with the Russians but plenty within its own ranks.

But there must be some doubt about the endless pursuit of ever more advanced military technology, in which America may now set a stiffer pace. For one thing, arms sales tend to transfer some of such technology to potential enemies, necessitating further technical leaps in the advanced countries. For another, the requirement that western forces have overwhelming technical superiority reinforces the casualty sensitivity that is their greatest weakness.</p> <p>More broadly, in both America and Europe, the military is too often seen as the right response to problems better tackled in different ways.

      "body": "<p>The key to John Rosselli, journalist with the Manchester Guardian, historian and musicologist, who has died aged 73, was his remarkable family background on his Italian father's side. This was mainly Florentine of the Risorgimento, based on wealth from the ownership of mercury mines in southern Tuscany, but sustaining a strong intellectual family tradition.</p> <p>The political thinker Giuseppe Mazzini passed his last days in the home of one relative; another was a member of the government of the short-lived Venetian republic of 1849. John's grandmother, Amelia, was a cousin of Alberto Moravia and herself a prominent writer.</p> <p>John's father, Carlo, an academic economist and social democrat, became the founder, funder and driving force of Giustizia e Libert\u00e0 (both an action movement and a weekly paper), which constituted virtually the only effective opposition to Mussolini in the 1930s. Imprisoned in 1927 for helping anti-fascists flee from Italy, he himself escaped in July 1929 from internment on the island of Lipari and, first organising resistance to the fascists from Paris, raised the Italian contingent to the International Brigade in the Spanish civil war.</p> <p>For his pains, Carlo and his brother Nello were murdered in France in May 1937. The assassins were French fascists operating on behalf of Mussolini. The funeral in Paris was one of the largest leftwing demonstrations of the Popular Front period. Many Italian towns, especially in the red belt of Tuscany and Emilia, have a boulevard named after the Fratelli Rosselli.</p> <p>John (in reality Giovanni) Rosselli was deeply marked by these rich and painful antecedents. His father first met him (aged three months) in prison in Savona. His English mother, Marion, a Sussex village postmaster's daughter, joined Carlo on Lipari. On his father's escape, John grew up in Paris among the political exiles and intellectual grand bourgeois , already fluent in Italian, English and French. He was only 10 when his father was killed.</p> <p>Years later, in 1960, John published a curious article in The Twentieth Century, which tended to show him as cut off from the turbid feelings of the murder. Friends from childhood thought it a kind of exorcism. One remembered that though he was not allowed to attend the funeral, he had nonetheless read all the papers and knew every available detail. Significantly, he wrote that his first thought when his mother burst in with the frightful news was, \"We've been ruined.\"</p> <p>From that moment on, as the eldest son and a boy of exceptional intelligence, with a mother suffering from heart disease, John bore himself as the family's heir apparent; his sense of responsibility became a dominant feature of his character. All this created tensions at the time with his younger brother, Andrea, and sister, Amelia, the future poet, who committed suicide in 1986.</p> <p>In Paris, the Rossellis were close to the families of Elie Hal\u00e9vy, the great historian of Victorian England, and Louis Joxe, who later became one of de Gaulle's ministers. They spent the winter of 1939-40 with the Joxes in Nantes. As France fell, Marion announced: \"I am not going to hand my children over to the enemy,\" (her husband's family were Jewish as well as anti-fascist) and left overnight for England and, after a few months, the United States.</p> <p>In 1942, John went to Swarthmore College, near Philadelphia, where he took a BA in humanities, was assistant editor of the college newspaper, acted in plays reviewed by WH Auden (then a Swarthmore teacher), met a Baltimore Quaker, Nicky Farrar, whom he was to marry a decade later after her divorce from her first husband, and, in 1946, graduated summa cum laude .</p> <p>At this point he opted to live in England to be with his mother, now seriously ill. He served in the British army - as a sergeant monitoring traffic through the port of Trieste - and, after demobilisation, buckled down to a PhD at Peterhouse, Cambridge, supervised by Herbert Butterfield, his much admired tutor and mentor. His thesis, Lord William Bentinck And The British Occupation Of Sicily, 1811-1814, won the Thirlwall prize and was published in 1956.</p> <p>By this time, John was already a seasoned journalist. On Butterfield's suggestion to AP Wadsworth, then editor of the Manchester Guardian, he joined the newspaper in 1951, and soon settled in as a prompt, subtle and well-informed leader-writer. His astonishing memory and multilingual range of political, literary and musical interests - more Risorgimento son than product of the interwar age of anxiety - made him, inevitably, literary editor as well (1953-56).</p> <p>Though his manner was casual enough, John had read all the books, seen all the plays, heard all the operas, kept abreast of all the developments, as if by osmosis. Colleagues with a reverence for culture admired him as an aristocrat of the mind; others, as Geoffrey Taylor admitted in his vivid Changing Faces: A History Of The Guardian 1956-1988, found him dauntingly intellectual. Either way, his voice was heard in the small circle round the editor. This was confirmed when Wadsworth (whom John loved and about whom he wrote a penetrating obituary) died in 1956 and was succeeded by Alastair Hetherington.</p> <p>In the following years, a new generation took over, including strong-minded characters such as John Cole, John Maddox, David Marquand, Leonard Beaton and John himself. New commercial forces were also changing the milieu. The great issue became the transfer of the paper's headquarters from Manchester to London, to compete as a national.</p> <p>John's marriage in 1956 took him south as deputy London editor under Gerry Fay, mainly because Nicky had made it a condition that they should live in London - and also have central heating, not quintessentially English at the time. In 1962, he became features editor in London, succeeding Brian Redhead in Manchester.</p> <p>There was a nasty incident when Redhead organised a round robin signed by his staff to keep Rosselli out of the job. But John soon won his colleagues round, and changed the balance of features - which could have been what Redhead feared. He muted their north country accents and broadened them to a metropolitan, even cosmopolitan, range and diversity of subject matter.</p> <p>But the split in staff and printing between Manchester and London, and John's own conscientiousness, began to exhaust him. He was also out of sympathy with the way he felt the paper was moving - in imitation of the Daily Telegraph, as he put it - under the commercial and cultural pressures of the 1960s. Against the current, he argued for a Guardian in the style of Le Monde, catering for high intellectual expectations, at a time when the broadsheets were trying to widen their appeal, listening less to writers and more to the marketing department.</p> <p>This, and the call of the academic life, led John in the autumn of 1964 to the new University of Sussex, whose interdisciplinary approach to teaching (at least in theory) suited his breadth of outlook. He taught political and cultural history, though teaching was only one of his multifarious duties, and his acute sense of responsibility led him to accept a relentless succession of administrative jobs.</p> <p>As early as 1965-67, he was chairman of the BA preliminary examination board. This was followed by the chair of the senate discipline committee, the chair of the history subject group, the chair of the working party on the future of the school of European studies, the presidency of the lecturers' union in the university, and the deanship of English and American studies (1983-85). He became a reader, but was never appointed to a chair, an omission which surprised a number of colleagues.</p> <p>Gradually, and at gathering pace, Rosselli built up a body of original work of considerable quality and scope. At first, he concentrated on Lord Bentinck and (with the Einaudi publishing house in Italy) on editing his father's voluminous papers, the first tome of which appeared in 1976. Before that, in 1974, Chatto published Lord William Bentinck: The Making Of A Liberal Imperialist 1774-1839, a biography which moved on from Sicily to the great phase in Bentinck's career, as governor of Bengal in the 1820s, when he introduced policies which influenced the later waves of reform in Britain.</p> <p>This led Rosselli to an interest in Bengal itself. At least one Bengali colleague considers that he learned (very rapidly) to speak and write exceptionally good Bengali, a feat at the age of 50, and that his work on late 19th-century Bengali culture was original and important. Sitting slim on his bicycle under an umbrella in Calcutta, Rosselli himself joked that he resembled a pandit.</p> <p>But with research money ebbing away, and limited interest in Bengal in English academic circles, his work in this field gradually dried up and he entered his third and final phase, building on his interest in music to become a historian of opera. He had never stopped writing opera reviews for the Guardian.</p> <p>From the early 1980s onwards, Rosselli produced a series of studies written ahead of schedule, yet with academic standards of research. Two books, The Opera Industry In Italy From Cimarosa To Verdi: The Role Of The Impresario (1984), and Singers Of Italian Opera: The History Of A Profession (1992), opened up a neglected field, the economic history of opera. He also wrote a number of articles for the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which led on to four other works. The first was Music And Musicians In 19th-century Italy (1991).</p> <p>Then came three biographies in the Cambridge University Press series of musical lives, Bellini (1996), Mozart (1998) and Verdi (2000). All were notable for the depth conferred by John's knowledge of the social and cultural background, especially in Italy, and one at least, Bellini, for substantial new findings. His writing in his early years was sometimes a little wooden, but most of this later work is conversational, rapid and relaxed, and sometimes a delight to read.</p> <p>Within four months of his wife's sudden death in February 1989, John took early retirement, sold his house in Brighton (a town he never liked), moved to Cambridge and, though secular by family tradition, entered the Anglican communion. It transpired that he had been considering this for at least 20 years, but had not done so because his wife felt she could not follow him. In 1995, he moved to a village south of Siena, and latterly to Florence, with a distant cousin, Lisa Sarfatti, a widow of great charm.</p> <p>With all his activities and interests, John was a very private man with great self- control, who was able to wear, at the age of 70, the evening clothes made for him when he was 18. He was an assiduous friend and devoted family man, with an assumption of closeness perhaps more Italian than British.</p> <p>He was a liberal of deep moral and intellectual strength, with spiritual leanings he did not wear on his sleeve, a papabile in his spheres, who might have edited a national paper and, some thought, should have held a chair; but he did neither and was too disciplined, and had too many interests, for really keen regrets.</p> <p>He died in Cambridge and is survived by Lisa and two sons.</p> <p>Giovanni 'John' Rosselli, historian, musicologist, author and journalist, born June 8 1927; died January 16 2001</p>",

Then came three biographies in the Cambridge University Press series of musical lives, Bellini (1996), Mozart (1998) and Verdi (2000). All were notable for the depth conferred by John's knowledge of the social and cultural background, especially in Italy, and one at least, Bellini, for substantial new findings. His writing in his early years was sometimes a little wooden, but most of this later work is conversational, rapid and relaxed, and sometimes a delight to read. Within four months of his wife's sudden death in February 1989, John took early retirement, sold his house in Brighton (a town he never liked), moved to Cambridge and, though secular by family tradition, entered the Anglican communion. It transpired that he had been considering this for at least 20 years, but had not done so because his wife felt she could not follow him. In 1995, he moved to a village south of Siena, and latterly to Florence, with a distant cousin, Lisa Sarfatti, a widow of great charm. With all his activities and interests, John was a very private man with great self- control, who was able to wear, at the age of 70, the evening clothes made for him when he was 18. He was an assiduous friend and devoted family man, with an assumption of closeness perhaps more Italian than British. He was a liberal of deep moral and intellectual strength, with spiritual leanings he did not wear on his sleeve, a papabile in his spheres, who might have edited a national paper and, some thought, should have held a chair; but he did neither and was too disciplined, and had too many interests, for really keen regrets. He died in Cambridge and is survived by Lisa and two sons. Giovanni 'John' Rosselli, historian, musicologist, author and journalist, born June 8 1927; died January 16 2001",

He then promptly fell out with his Uganda and Rwandan backers, who assisted a new Congolese rebellion in August 1998.</p> <p>Ugandan-backed rebels again advanced from the north-eastern borders and threatened Kinshasa. Kabila invoked his friendship with Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia's erstwhile leftist governments, and their troops fought off the rebellion.</p> <p>But the war continued and had an inevitable impact on his style of government. Deeply influenced by Congo's tragic history of foreign intervention, Kabila resurrected nostrums from his 1960s leftist past. He established a one-party state, promised - but never delivered - elections, and alienated foreign investors by refusing to make payments on the gigantic foreign debt of $14bn incurred by his profligate predecessor. He also ignored UN demands for an inquiry into the massacre of Rwandan refugees in eastern Congo in 1997.</p> <p>Well-meaning brokers like Nelson Mandela sought to mediate an end to the war, but Kabila refused to take any notice. His mercurial temperament, and his ability to change sides, left him with few friends either at home or abroad. In the end, his early promise was dissipated in his futile attempt to retain Congo as his personal fiefdom, much as Mob-utu had done before him.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, and his son Joseph.</p> <p>\u0095 Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, politician, born November 27 1939; died January 17 2001</p>",

Kabila did not reappear on the international stage until May 1997, when his forces captured Kinshasa after a 10-day campaign. He was greeted as a liberator as his rebels moved south, supported by the eastern Congo's Tutsis and Rwandan and Ugandan army units. Mobutu fled before the fall of Kinshasa, and the new President Kabila renamed the country - Mobutu's Zaire - as the Democratic Republic of Congo, and indicated that he would follow in the footsteps of Museveni, who had created a liberal and competent Ugandan government. He then promptly fell out with his Uganda and Rwandan backers, who assisted a new Congolese rebellion in August 1998. Ugandan-backed rebels again advanced from the north-eastern borders and threatened Kinshasa. Kabila invoked his friendship with Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia's erstwhile leftist governments, and their troops fought off the rebellion. But the war continued and had an inevitable impact on his style of government. Deeply influenced by Congo's tragic history of foreign intervention, Kabila resurrected nostrums from his 1960s leftist past. He established a one-party state, promised - but never delivered - elections, and alienated foreign investors by refusing to make payments on the gigantic foreign debt of $14bn incurred by his profligate predecessor. He also ignored UN demands for an inquiry into the massacre of Rwandan refugees in eastern Congo in 1997. Well-meaning brokers like Nelson Mandela sought to mediate an end to the war, but Kabila refused to take any notice. His mercurial temperament, and his ability to change sides, left him with few friends either at home or abroad. In the end, his early promise was dissipated in his futile attempt to retain Congo as his personal fiefdom, much as Mob-utu had done before him. He is survived by his wife, and his son Joseph. \u0095 Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila, politician, born November 27 1939; died January 17 2001",

They argued politicians could not be trusted with Britain's nuclear arsenal, so civilians had to act to stop disaster.</p> <p>The Manchester jury's verdict, which follows a string of acquittals in cases of sabotage against military equipment was welcomed last night by anti-nuclear campaigners, who described it as highly significant.</p> <p>\"The jury has given the clearest possible decision legally, factually and morally, on the continued possession by Britain of weapons of mass destruction and where governments fail us, of the necessity of direct action\", Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Sylvia Boyes.</p> <p>David Mackenize of Trident Ploughshares said it was the first time the prosecution had brought a conspiracy charge, a notoriously broad indictment, against members of the group. \"It will be a superb encouragement for activists\", he said.</p> <p>At Manchester crown court, the judge, Rhys Davies, had earlier told jurors that the two protesters could be seen as \"thoroughly decent and ideal istic people\" doing what thought was right. But however genuine the activists' beliefs, ideals formed no defence against a criminal damage charge.</p> <p>Ms Boyes, a former lollypop lady, and River, an Open University lecturer with a master's degree in high energy nuclear physics, were found dressed in wetsuits near the submarine on November 23. They were carrying hammers, an axe and six cans of aerosol varnish.</p> <p>The protesters, members of the direct action group, Trident Ploughshares, said they aimed to disarm HMS Vengeance which was equipped to carry one quarter of Britain's nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Trident Ploughshares added: \"At last a precedent has been set for English people to follow their conscience and declare Trident illegal.</p> <p>\"This will pave the way for further legal direct action to disarm submarines.\"</p> <p>The case is not the first example of direct action protesters walking free from court. At Manchester crown court last year, a jury acquitted two women of spray painting a nuclear submarine at Barrow with anti-war slogans and were unable to reach a verdict on a second charge of criminal damage. The prosecution asked for a retrial.</p> <p>In 1999, a sheriff in Greenock, Strathclyde, handed down not guilty verdicts against three women charged with causing \u00a380,000 damage to Trident submarine computer equipment at a naval establishment on Loch Goil.</p> <p>In 1996, a jury at Liverpool crown court acquitted two women charged with causing \u00a31.5m damage to a Hawk fighter jet at a British Aerospace factory.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two anti-nuclear protesters who entered a dockyard planning to disarm one of Britain's Trident submarines with an axe were yesterday cleared of conspiracy to cause criminal damage. Sylvia Boyes, 57, from Keighley, West Yorkshire, and River - formerly Keith Wright - 45, from Manchester, admitted that they plotted to damage HMS Vengeance while it was docked at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in November 1999. But they denied criminal damage, claiming their actions were justifed because nuclear weapons were immoral and illegal under international law. They argued politicians could not be trusted with Britain's nuclear arsenal, so civilians had to act to stop disaster. The Manchester jury's verdict, which follows a string of acquittals in cases of sabotage against military equipment was welcomed last night by anti-nuclear campaigners, who described it as highly significant. \"The jury has given the clearest possible decision legally, factually and morally, on the continued possession by Britain of weapons of mass destruction and where governments fail us, of the necessity of direct action\", Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Sylvia Boyes. David Mackenize of Trident Ploughshares said it was the first time the prosecution had brought a conspiracy charge, a notoriously broad indictment, against members of the group. \"It will be a superb encouragement for activists\", he said. At Manchester crown court, the judge, Rhys Davies, had earlier told jurors that the two protesters could be seen as \"thoroughly decent and ideal istic people\" doing what thought was right. But however genuine the activists' beliefs, ideals formed no defence against a criminal damage charge. Ms Boyes, a former lollypop lady, and River, an Open University lecturer with a master's degree in high energy nuclear physics, were found dressed in wetsuits near the submarine on November 23. They were carrying hammers, an axe and six cans of aerosol varnish. The protesters, members of the direct action group, Trident Ploughshares, said they aimed to disarm HMS Vengeance which was equipped to carry one quarter of Britain's nuclear arsenal. A spokeswoman for Trident Ploughshares added: \"At last a precedent has been set for English people to follow their conscience and declare Trident illegal. \"This will pave the way for further legal direct action to disarm submarines.\" The case is not the first example of direct action protesters walking free from court. At Manchester crown court last year, a jury acquitted two women of spray painting a nuclear submarine at Barrow with anti-war slogans and were unable to reach a verdict on a second charge of criminal damage. The prosecution asked for a retrial. In 1999, a sheriff in Greenock, Strathclyde, handed down not guilty verdicts against three women charged with causing \u00a380,000 damage to Trident submarine computer equipment at a naval establishment on Loch Goil. In 1996, a jury at Liverpool crown court acquitted two women charged with causing \u00a31.5m damage to a Hawk fighter jet at a British Aerospace factory.",

There is evidence that one of the main reasons embryos fail to implant, or pregnancies end in miscarriage, is that the embryo's cells have one too many or one too few chromosomes. This problem, known as aneuploidy, is more severe with women over 35. Limited screening of IVF embryos for chromosomal abnormalities already takes place, because an extra 21st chromosome is already known to cause Down's syndrome. But it is now possible to screen as many as eight chromosomes, greatly increasing the chances of identifying an embryo unlikely to result in successful pregnancy.

Why in the world would any woman with self-respect stay with a husband that did to her what he did unless there were a larger goal? </p> <p><b>Camille Paglia</b><br> </p> <p><b>Writer and academic</b> </p> <p>As a Democrat who voted for Bill Clinton twice and gradually became bitterly disillusioned, I can only say that the Clinton legacy is wormwood and ashes. </p> <p>Clinton took office in a blaze of idealism as the first president of my post-war baby boom generation. But he governed like a schizophrenic hack, turning diplomacy into photo opportunities. </p> <p>He divided this nation, abused the military, lived by lies, and pandered to the poor while sucking up to the rich and famous. He coasted on a prosperity he did not create, and he cheapened the office he held. After Clinton, public service has become just another cynical branch of show business. </p> <p><b>Hugh Price </b><br> </p> <p><b>President, National Urban League</b> </p> <p>Clinton's legacy for the African American community is a complicated picture. The extraordinary economic growth has certainly reached into our community, where poverty has begun declining and unemployment is finally on the way down. But as far as the criminal justice system is concerned, he was very late in doing anything about the issues of racial profiling, police abuse, and the differential treatment of black and whites in implementing drug policy. </p> <p>As a \"New Democrat\" it would have been easy for him to walk away from the principles of affirmative action. Yet he stuck by that. </p> <p><b>Robert Reich</b><br> </p> <p><b>Former US secretary of labour</b> </p> <p>I think historians looking at the Clinton presidency will sum it up in three ways. The first paragraph will be a wonderful economy. The second paragraph will be skilled politician; kept the Republicans at bay when they ran Congress. And the third paragraph will be scandals, particularly Monica Lewinsky. </p> <p>In 1992-93 he was in the process of reinventing progressive politics. Rather than Thatcherite social Darwinism, he saw that the goal must be to move forward into the new economy and bring as many people along as possible. But by the time 1996 rolled around his campaign was about nothing. It was about Dick Morris's ideas about school uniforms and V-chips - no real substance. He certainly repositioned the Democrats but it's unclear whether he did it or the Republicans did. I don't know that there's anything progressive about what Clintonism has become. </p> <p><b>Studs Terkel</b><br> </p> <p><b>Historian, critic and broadcaster</b> </p> <p>Forget about all the Monica bullshit. That's not important. What's important is that Clinton had a great chance to be progressive. The country was ready but the word didn't come. He listened to that pimp Dick Morris. He moved the party sharply to the right, and now we have to recover from it. A terrible, terrible missed chance. </p> <p>The country has never been more ready for universal health insurance. Every family in the country is worried stiff about it. It doesn't matter how rightwing they are, they're all worried. </p> <p><b>Arianna Huffington</b><br> </p> <p><b>Author</b> </p> <p>Over two terms, he let the good times roll, tailoring his priorities to the polls and hoarding his political capital as if he thinks it's redeemable for something when he leaves office. Now, in the sobering light of the morning after, he's taking stock. </p> <p>It's as if while packing up the Oval Office he discovered a trove of his idealistic campaign speeches. Unfortunately, there seems to be a massive disconnect between the crises he bemoans and his role in allowing or even promoting them. He's much better at sounding like a great president than being one. </p> <p><b>Jody Williams</b><br> </p> <p><b>1997 Nobel Peace Prize winner</b> </p> <p>He could have done so much more. He could have signed the international landmine ban treaty. He has repeatedly said it was one of the bitterest disappointments of his presidency that he couldn't. I'm not sure why he bought the military argument. </p> <p>I think he was a brilliant man but Shakespeareanly flawed. When I won the peace prize, I said the same things I have always said: that the US could have and should have signed the treaty, that the commander-in-chief should be a commander-in-chief. </p> <p><b>Steve Forbes </b><br> </p> <p><b>Magazine publisher. Republican presidential contender</b> </p> <p>For all the theatre, Clinton's was a failed presidency. He failed to reform our horrific tax code, Medicare, social security and our troubled schools. He degraded the justice department as no president has done before him. He failed to provide a coherent direction for our post-cold war foreign policy. </p> <p>Opportunistic photo ops, not principle, was his diplomatic guide stone. Ironically the 1994 Republican surge saved his presidency, curbing spending, cutting taxes and forcing Clinton to sign an historic welfare reform bill. Wisely, he left GOP-appointed Greenspan in place and alone. The economy boomed. </p> <p><b>Dick Morris</b><br> </p> <p><b>Ran Clinton's 1996 election campaign</b> </p> <p>By day, he solved every problem America faced when he took office. By night, he enmeshed himself in such scandal as to drown it all out. </p> <p>By day, he transformed a huge budget deficit into a surplus that will pay off our entire national debt in a decade. By night, he hired detectives to dig up dirt on women, troopers who had guarded him, and political opponents. </p> <p>By day, he reduced poverty in the US by almost 20%. By night, he lowered even further faith in government integrity. </p> <p>By day, he cut smoking, controlled guns, cut crime, catalysed the peace initiative in Ireland, stopped Milosevic in Kosovo and the Balkans, restored democracy in Haiti and brought North Korea in from the cold. </p> <p>By night, he broke the heart of the nation by proving himself to be a flawed man in a job for which he lacked the maturity.</p>",

He certainly repositioned the Democrats but it's unclear whether he did it or the Republicans did. I don't know that there's anything progressive about what Clintonism has become. Studs Terkel Historian, critic and broadcaster Forget about all the Monica bullshit. That's not important. What's important is that Clinton had a great chance to be progressive. The country was ready but the word didn't come. He listened to that pimp Dick Morris. He moved the party sharply to the right, and now we have to recover from it. A terrible, terrible missed chance. The country has never been more ready for universal health insurance. Every family in the country is worried stiff about it. It doesn't matter how rightwing they are, they're all worried. Arianna Huffington Author Over two terms, he let the good times roll, tailoring his priorities to the polls and hoarding his political capital as if he thinks it's redeemable for something when he leaves office. Now, in the sobering light of the morning after, he's taking stock. It's as if while packing up the Oval Office he discovered a trove of his idealistic campaign speeches. Unfortunately, there seems to be a massive disconnect between the crises he bemoans and his role in allowing or even promoting them. He's much better at sounding like a great president than being one. Jody Williams 1997 Nobel Peace Prize winner He could have done so much more. He could have signed the international landmine ban treaty. He has repeatedly said it was one of the bitterest disappointments of his presidency that he couldn't. I'm not sure why he bought the military argument. I think he was a brilliant man but Shakespeareanly flawed. When I won the peace prize, I said the same things I have always said: that the US could have and should have signed the treaty, that the commander-in-chief should be a commander-in-chief. Steve Forbes Magazine publisher. Republican presidential contender For all the theatre, Clinton's was a failed presidency. He failed to reform our horrific tax code, Medicare, social security and our troubled schools. He degraded the justice department as no president has done before him. He failed to provide a coherent direction for our post-cold war foreign policy. Opportunistic photo ops, not principle, was his diplomatic guide stone. Ironically the 1994 Republican surge saved his presidency, curbing spending, cutting taxes and forcing Clinton to sign an historic welfare reform bill. Wisely, he left GOP-appointed Greenspan in place and alone. The economy boomed. Dick Morris Ran Clinton's 1996 election campaign By day, he solved every problem America faced when he took office. By night, he enmeshed himself in such scandal as to drown it all out. By day, he transformed a huge budget deficit into a surplus that will pay off our entire national debt in a decade. By night, he hired detectives to dig up dirt on women, troopers who had guarded him, and political opponents. By day, he reduced poverty in the US by almost 20%. By night, he lowered even further faith in government integrity. By day, he cut smoking, controlled guns, cut crime, catalysed the peace initiative in Ireland, stopped Milosevic in Kosovo and the Balkans, restored democracy in Haiti and brought North Korea in from the cold. By night, he broke the heart of the nation by proving himself to be a flawed man in a job for which he lacked the maturity.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Well done, Charles Wilson, newly installed executive director of stores group Arcadia. He is obviously an extraordinarily insightful stock-picker. </p> <p>Mr Wilson was wooed away from supermarket group Iceland by his former boss, Stuart Rose, when Mr Rose was installed as chief executive of Arcadia. </p> <p>To ease his passage to the ailing fashion retailer he was awarded a handsome golden hello of some \u00a3220,000 to make up for gains he would have made on Iceland options - had he decided to stay with the Deesside grocers. He then nobly splurged the lot on Arcadia shares, presumably as a token of his commitment to the task of turning around the underperforming outfitter. </p> <p>He then raided his own personal piggybank for \u00a3100,000 to buy another 105,000 or so shares. Obviously, he still did not think that was enough to demonstrate that he was deadly serious about aligning his interests with those of other shareholders, and a couple of days later wrote out another cheque - this time for north of \u00a385,000 - for another 92,000 Arcadia shares. </p> <p>His total commitment? A chunky \u00a3407,000. Obviously Mr Wilson had no special insight into Arcadia's recent trading figures, released yesterday, but as it turns out he has picked a winner. </p> <p>Arcadia's shares have been motoring in the last week as rumours spread that the firm might be about to break with recent tradition and actually report some good news - and yesterday they did. The 4.3% improvement in like-for-like sales added a little more spice to the shares, and they closed up 7p at 125p. </p> <p>The net result so far for the canny Mr Wilson is a profit of more than \u00a3120,000 - in a week. The company says no rules were breached, it was not a closed period and that the trading was approved by Mr Rose. But Mr Rose should also beware. On present form, his righthand man must surely be considering giving up his day job to concentrate on share dealing. </p> <p><strong> Name game </strong><br> </p> <p> One has to marvel at Powergen's sense of timing. The day after it confirmed that it could be swallowed up by Germany's second largest utilities group, it announced a new corporate advertising campaign. It then revealed that it was having its brand name valued for the first time. This decision, somewhat late in the day, was taken to help decide how to use the name to best effect. </p> <p>At the beginning of 1999, electricity generation accounted for 90% of Powergen's business. Now it accounts for only 10%. In the intervening years, the group has sold off generating capacity and plunged into retailing electricity, gas, fixed and mobile telephony and financial services. All of these except financial services are now being marketed under the Powergen name - with customers having the option of receiving only one bill for all the services. </p> <p>The group believes that it has created a national utilities brand name - not least through its sponsorship of television weather forecasts. But the group's new front means that the catchy \"Powergen - power, whatever the weather\" slogan which accompanied the forecasts has now been replaced by the leaden \"Powergen - gas, electricity and telephone\" </p> <p>The launch yesterday of Powergen's new branding has been overshadowed by Tuesday's announcement that Germany's E.ON was considering a bid for the group. By the time Interbrand completes its valuation of the Powergen name, it could all be over bar the shouting. The issue, by then, may be the value of the name E.ON. </p> <p><strong> Bald facts </strong><br> </p> <p> On one of his increasingly rare visits to the planet earth, Phytopharm's chief executive Richard Dixey yesterday conceded defeat in his battle to cure baldness with an exotic concoction of Mediterranean herbs. </p> <p>Few will be surprised that the effort was a flop.

      "bodyText": "Well done, Charles Wilson, newly installed executive director of stores group Arcadia. He is obviously an extraordinarily insightful stock-picker. Mr Wilson was wooed away from supermarket group Iceland by his former boss, Stuart Rose, when Mr Rose was installed as chief executive of Arcadia. To ease his passage to the ailing fashion retailer he was awarded a handsome golden hello of some \u00a3220,000 to make up for gains he would have made on Iceland options - had he decided to stay with the Deesside grocers. He then nobly splurged the lot on Arcadia shares, presumably as a token of his commitment to the task of turning around the underperforming outfitter. He then raided his own personal piggybank for \u00a3100,000 to buy another 105,000 or so shares. Obviously, he still did not think that was enough to demonstrate that he was deadly serious about aligning his interests with those of other shareholders, and a couple of days later wrote out another cheque - this time for north of \u00a385,000 - for another 92,000 Arcadia shares. His total commitment? A chunky \u00a3407,000. Obviously Mr Wilson had no special insight into Arcadia's recent trading figures, released yesterday, but as it turns out he has picked a winner. Arcadia's shares have been motoring in the last week as rumours spread that the firm might be about to break with recent tradition and actually report some good news - and yesterday they did. The 4.3% improvement in like-for-like sales added a little more spice to the shares, and they closed up 7p at 125p. The net result so far for the canny Mr Wilson is a profit of more than \u00a3120,000 - in a week. The company says no rules were breached, it was not a closed period and that the trading was approved by Mr Rose. But Mr Rose should also beware. On present form, his righthand man must surely be considering giving up his day job to concentrate on share dealing. Name game One has to marvel at Powergen's sense of timing. The day after it confirmed that it could be swallowed up by Germany's second largest utilities group, it announced a new corporate advertising campaign. It then revealed that it was having its brand name valued for the first time. This decision, somewhat late in the day, was taken to help decide how to use the name to best effect. At the beginning of 1999, electricity generation accounted for 90% of Powergen's business. Now it accounts for only 10%. In the intervening years, the group has sold off generating capacity and plunged into retailing electricity, gas, fixed and mobile telephony and financial services. All of these except financial services are now being marketed under the Powergen name - with customers having the option of receiving only one bill for all the services. The group believes that it has created a national utilities brand name - not least through its sponsorship of television weather forecasts. But the group's new front means that the catchy \"Powergen - power, whatever the weather\" slogan which accompanied the forecasts has now been replaced by the leaden \"Powergen - gas, electricity and telephone\" The launch yesterday of Powergen's new branding has been overshadowed by Tuesday's announcement that Germany's E.ON was considering a bid for the group. By the time Interbrand completes its valuation of the Powergen name, it could all be over bar the shouting. The issue, by then, may be the value of the name E.ON. Bald facts On one of his increasingly rare visits to the planet earth, Phytopharm's chief executive Richard Dixey yesterday conceded defeat in his battle to cure baldness with an exotic concoction of Mediterranean herbs. Few will be surprised that the effort was a flop. But in keeping with Phytopharm's quirky tradition, its figures contained an apparent gem: a daily dab of cold cream, or some other moisturiser, restored hair growth in 38% of its balding stockbrokers. This is either an astounding medical breakthrough or the result of a distinctly dubious clinical trial. The clue lies in the small print, which reveals that only 24 out of 75 patients turned up to have their heads photographed at the end of the trial. It seems that Phytopharm doled out four months' supply of cream to each patient, giving them no particular incentive to turn up for appraisals. Presumably only those pleased with the results bothered to go back. Phytopharm's decision to test baldness drugs on City analysts was, in itself, odd - given their influence over the firm's share price. The company's trial designers will have to do better than this if Phytopharm wants to be taken seriously.",

      "body": "<p>Steve Thoburn, the market trader in Sunderland magistrates court this week for selling fruit in pounds and ounces alone rather than along with metric measures, was not prosecuted under the law as it is usually understood - a statute passed after deliberation by MPs and peers. He was done under \"delegated legislation\". The case was brought under the Units of Measurement Regulations 1994 - which came into effect in 2000.</p> <p>Parliament passed 3,412 similar regulations last year. MPs have only been back at work a few days after the Christmas break and already they have passed 60 of them. While parliament gets to \"see\" them, all but a handful go through on the nod. Few have even the remotest chance of being debated, let alone defeated.</p> <p>There is nothing new about governments' use of statutory instruments or SIs - even if, as the chart shows, the annual average has been rising in recent years. (Annual records began in 1895.) The Tories were committed to lightening the regulatory load but Thatcher and Major presided over a very big increase.</p> <p>Such orders can only be made under a pre-existing act of parliament. Sometimes statutes can give very broad licence, such as the 1972 European Communities Act under which the metric regulation was issued.</p> <p>These are laws made by civil servants. A minister, usually not the secretary of state, does see and approve them but the crucial decisions about what should be in regulations, their timing and indeed whether they should be made at all, are taken within Whitehall, not usually by the senior civil service but many grades below.</p> <p>As citizens and taxpayers we would probably object to our MPs spending too much time immersing themselves in the detail of the Thames Estuary Cockle Fishery Order 1994 or the Baking and Sausage Making (Christmas and New Year) Regulations 1985 and the thousands like them passed each year. But they are not all a matter of routine. The issues behind some other regulations make frontpage headlines such as the supply of arms to Sierra Leone (the Sierra Leone [UN sanctions] Order 1997) and whether butchers should be allowed to sell beef on the bone (the Beef Bones Regulations 1997).

      "bodyText": "Steve Thoburn, the market trader in Sunderland magistrates court this week for selling fruit in pounds and ounces alone rather than along with metric measures, was not prosecuted under the law as it is usually understood - a statute passed after deliberation by MPs and peers. He was done under \"delegated legislation\". The case was brought under the Units of Measurement Regulations 1994 - which came into effect in 2000. Parliament passed 3,412 similar regulations last year. MPs have only been back at work a few days after the Christmas break and already they have passed 60 of them. While parliament gets to \"see\" them, all but a handful go through on the nod. Few have even the remotest chance of being debated, let alone defeated. There is nothing new about governments' use of statutory instruments or SIs - even if, as the chart shows, the annual average has been rising in recent years. (Annual records began in 1895.) The Tories were committed to lightening the regulatory load but Thatcher and Major presided over a very big increase. Such orders can only be made under a pre-existing act of parliament. Sometimes statutes can give very broad licence, such as the 1972 European Communities Act under which the metric regulation was issued. These are laws made by civil servants. A minister, usually not the secretary of state, does see and approve them but the crucial decisions about what should be in regulations, their timing and indeed whether they should be made at all, are taken within Whitehall, not usually by the senior civil service but many grades below. As citizens and taxpayers we would probably object to our MPs spending too much time immersing themselves in the detail of the Thames Estuary Cockle Fishery Order 1994 or the Baking and Sausage Making (Christmas and New Year) Regulations 1985 and the thousands like them passed each year. But they are not all a matter of routine. The issues behind some other regulations make frontpage headlines such as the supply of arms to Sierra Leone (the Sierra Leone [UN sanctions] Order 1997) and whether butchers should be allowed to sell beef on the bone (the Beef Bones Regulations 1997). And there are very many more big issues (such as sentencing criminal offenders or eligibility for social security benefits) that do not make the frontpages. Of course, just because bureaucrats write them, this does not mean that they should not be on the statute books. In general, civil servants are a conscientious bunch who do not ban things just for fun. In the case of Mr Thoburn and his apples and oranges, they were \"only obeying orders\" in the form of EU council directives (80/181 and 89/617). If they did not pass the law, the government might be sued in the European court while the directives would not go away. At other times, civil servants react to public pressure.

While nasty folks on the religious right make veiled anti-Semitic remarks to Jewish members of the White House staff, President Josiah Bartlet (a hammy Martin Sheen) and friends demonstrate again and again that they're on the side of the angels.

It verges on the corny at points - especially when Sheen's Bartlet is spinning some folksy story with a Moral - and its theme tune is awfully turgid, but The West Wing succeeds by focusing less on Bartlet and more on those around him.

Tel: 01274 726513 </p> <p>Every now and then we all yearn for a primal blast of energy and flavour. That's the Kashmir for you. Forget lightweight, perfumed curries, relaxed, slow eating, and cutlery. This loud and brazen basement is for folk looking for a full-blown onslaught on the tastebuds. A landmark on the city's curry scene, the crowded kitchen serves up seriously sauced platefuls of chicken, lamb and veg with smoky, chewy chapatis included in the price (\u00a32.80 - \u00a34.80). Toothsome kebabs and bhajis for starters (50p - \u00a32.20), Kashmiri specials, kofta, lamb trotters, quail for main courses. A five-sense experience, they don't come any better, hotter, cheaper or quicker than this.</p> <p><b>Food on the net</b></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.cobrabeer.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cobrabeer.com</a> </p> <p>Cobra Beer's selling point is that it makes the perfect accompaniment to curry. The website is basically an extension of the Team Saatchi ad campaign, featuring Curry Dave. Here we are given a guided tour of Dave's new \"Naansion\", which has a sort of Cluedo-style layout but sadly no lead piping or candelabra. You'll find links left, right and centre, telling you all about the beer, the company and its entrepreneurial founder. And some nice snapshots of Curry Dave with his lovely lady, Amanda. </p> <p><b> Here comes the science bit:</b> Because Cobra Beer is less fizzy than most European beers, it allows you to eat more curry - instead of filling up on gas, you can guzzle more peshwari. Eureka! </p> <p><b>Just out</b></p> <p> Merchant gourmet organic sun-dried tomatoes </p> <p><b>Form:</b><br> Reddish-brown shrivelled ears. </p> <p><b> Flavour:</b><br> Meaty; salty; sort of ultra-condensed tomato. </p> <p><b> Verdict: </b> According to the bumph, these are grown on a Sicilian farm, dried for three to five days in the sun with the help of some sea salt, and then certified organic according to QC&amp;I International, the European certification body, whatever that might be. I'm not sure that the organic business adds anything to the flavour, which is at the aggressive end of the spectrum. Probably one to add to soups and stews rather than salads and sandwiches. In other words, the effect needs to be tempered. </p> <p><b>On the menu</b><br> Coco beans </p> <p><b>Oh come on, a bean is a bean is a bean.

So what's with this coco bean? </b><br> It's small, white, and like a small version of an haricot bean or an even smaller version of a cannellini bean, only rounder. </p> <p><b> Taste? </b><br> Quite like a haricot bean or a cannellini bean, to be honest. </p> <p><b> What's so special about them?</b> <br> They're a bit more delicate, and a bit creamier, and they go very nicely with confit of duck or roast cod. </p> <p><b> That's it? </b><br> 'Fraid so.</p>",

Tel: 01274 726513 Every now and then we all yearn for a primal blast of energy and flavour. That's the Kashmir for you. Forget lightweight, perfumed curries, relaxed, slow eating, and cutlery. This loud and brazen basement is for folk looking for a full-blown onslaught on the tastebuds. A landmark on the city's curry scene, the crowded kitchen serves up seriously sauced platefuls of chicken, lamb and veg with smoky, chewy chapatis included in the price (\u00a32.80 - \u00a34.80). Toothsome kebabs and bhajis for starters (50p - \u00a32.20), Kashmiri specials, kofta, lamb trotters, quail for main courses. A five-sense experience, they don't come any better, hotter, cheaper or quicker than this. Food on the net www.cobrabeer.com Cobra Beer's selling point is that it makes the perfect accompaniment to curry. The website is basically an extension of the Team Saatchi ad campaign, featuring Curry Dave. Here we are given a guided tour of Dave's new \"Naansion\", which has a sort of Cluedo-style layout but sadly no lead piping or candelabra. You'll find links left, right and centre, telling you all about the beer, the company and its entrepreneurial founder. And some nice snapshots of Curry Dave with his lovely lady, Amanda. Here comes the science bit: Because Cobra Beer is less fizzy than most European beers, it allows you to eat more curry - instead of filling up on gas, you can guzzle more peshwari. Eureka! Just out Merchant gourmet organic sun-dried tomatoes Form: Reddish-brown shrivelled ears. Flavour: Meaty; salty; sort of ultra-condensed tomato. Verdict: According to the bumph, these are grown on a Sicilian farm, dried for three to five days in the sun with the help of some sea salt, and then certified organic according to QC&amp;I International, the European certification body, whatever that might be. I'm not sure that the organic business adds anything to the flavour, which is at the aggressive end of the spectrum. Probably one to add to soups and stews rather than salads and sandwiches. In other words, the effect needs to be tempered. On the menu Coco beans Oh come on, a bean is a bean is a bean. Isn't it, old bean? Not when you have moth beans, runner beans, azuki beans, mung beans, soya beans, butter beans, haricot beans, kidney beans to name but a few, all of which are used for different dishes. OK. So what's with this coco bean? It's small, white, and like a small version of an haricot bean or an even smaller version of a cannellini bean, only rounder. Taste? Quite like a haricot bean or a cannellini bean, to be honest. What's so special about them? They're a bit more delicate, and a bit creamier, and they go very nicely with confit of duck or roast cod. That's it? 'Fraid so.",

First, how can a dreary, predictable chamber piece like this be so bad, despite a superlative performance by roughneck aristocrat Sean Connery? And second, what happened to Gus Van Sant anyway? </p> <p>To put it simply, success happened to Gus Van Sant; Hollywood happened to Gus Van Sant. Ten years ago he made one of the first and most enduring masterpieces of the 1990s, Drugstore Cowboy, whose brittle tenderness and romantic pessimism remain undiluted a decade later. Then he blew it with two chaotic flops, My Own Private Idaho, which was judged more as an important film made by a gay man (and in that respect it was a landmark) than as a controlled work of cinema (which it was not), and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, which felt like more of the same, or more precisely, less of the same. To Die For, a smug satire on the media by Buck Henry, brought Van Sant closer to the centre, and set him up for his present role in the system. </p> <p>Next came Good Will Hunting - to which, I note with muted horror, I awarded four stars on its release. Let me now take three of them back and say that Van Sant's first box-office smash was a bimbo of a movie, one that looked awful pretty if it caught you in a forgiving mood. It made stars of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck - two of the least charismatic actors of our time. Then came Van Sant's Psycho remake, of which I will say nothing at all, if only to keep my blood pressure in check. </p> <p>And now we have Finding Forrester, which is little more than a ghetto version of Good Will Hunting. It's about a 16-year-old black kid named Jamal who has an amazing talent for writing. He's taken under the wing of William Forrester, a reclusive writer who wrote one novel in the early 1950s which has since achieved the status of \"Great American Novel\" - even though its author is Scottish. </p> <p>That would be Sean, of course, his performance riffing on JD Salinger, the great absent presence of the American teenage novel, and other secretive scribes past and present. (Which reminds me of the lady who approached the publicity-shy Don DeLillo at a party and said, \"I know you! I've read all your books! You're William Gaddis!\" To which DeLillo replied, \"No, I'm Thomas Pynchon.\") Forrester lives on his royalties and never leaves his apartment in a rundown Brooklyn neighbourhood, preferring the solace provided by a bottle of J&amp;B. </p> <p>Connery fills Forrester with rage and sadness, sensitivity and gruffness and, by doing so, makes his own scenes very compelling. Jamal, played by gifted non-pro Rob Brown, is Will Hunting Redux. Despite his impoverished background, he's got it all: he's brainy, he's a great writer (albeit one who can't speak in sentences and paragraphs), he's a knockout on the basketball court, the chicks are all over him and, in the end, he gets every reward, wins every prize and saves the errant Forrester from himself. Van Sant, the ex-poet of Drugstore Cowboy, here surrenders himself wholesale to the Hollywood machine and its dread gospel of remakes and retreads. </p> <p>Still, that leaves us with another fine Connery performance to add to his bulging portfolio. The man really does endure - he was named Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine when he was pushing 70 - so he must be doing something right. These days, if you need someone to play God, don't think twice, give Connery a call. Something deep in his Caledonian soul pours out through those animal eyes and persuades you that this is a man of gravitas and ironclad self-assurance, someone you seriously shouldn't mess with. </p> <p>Allied to this sense of threat is his panther-like grace, still evident in his eighth decade, and that hinterland of guaranteed manliness and sexual authority that underpinned his stint as 007. He moaned about the superspy connection for years after relinquishing the role to Roger Moore, but our folk memory of the gentleman/thug Bond - wigs notwithstanding - is a shorthand for elegant machismo and feral grace. There are stories that back this up, such as the time on the set of Another Time, Another Place when he laid out Lana Turner's vicious boyfriend Johnny Stompanato with a single punch. </p> <p> When I look back over his career it's not Bond that stays in my mind, or his Oscar-winning Irish cop in The Untouchables. It's tiny details such as the young Sean dancing like a dervish in Cy Endfield's 1957 Hell Drivers, his tamed rapist Mark Rutland in Marnie, the slap he gives Candice Bergen in The Wind and the Lion (\"My name is Ali-Ben Raisuli. Do not laugh at me\"), or his brutalised sergeant in Sidney Lumet's The Hill, my own favourite Connery turn. </p> <p>He also gave masterclasses in how to age gracefully a long time before Clint Eastwood. In Dick Lester's elegiac Robin and Marian he plays an ageing Robin Hood, grunting and panting through his swordfights with an equally geriatric Robert Shaw. </p> <p>Finding Forrester sees him using all that stored-up power, and a face that, in close-up, is one of cinema's great shifting human landscapes.

      "body": "<p><strong> September 2000 </strong><br> </p> <p> I am sent a script of Tempted, an improvised film, to be shot in New Orleans. It is for the role of Lily LeBlanc, wife of Charlie - Burt Reynolds - a nouveau riche property developer. In fact, it is a non-script; it is a 60-page treatment of a contemporary thriller, with no dialogue on the page, hence the improv. Each scene is simply a description of what, emotionally, takes place. </p> <p>Charlie LeBlanc is a man eaten up with jealousy, obsessed with the idea that, given half a chance, his wife may cheat on him. A young character called Jimmy is paid to attempt to seduce Lily. Charlie promises more money if he's successful than if he's not. Over the course of five or six days, the trio's lives fall apart. They are all morally ambiguous and deception goes deep. </p> <p>Tempted's writer-director Bill Bennett made Kiss or Kill, an Aussie road movie, in this improvised fashion. I call Bill in New Orleans where he's prepping, and he tells me that Kiss or Kill was shot completely out of sequence, and entirely looped. The whole thing. This horrifies me. In orthodox film-making, you never shoot sequentially - but with improv, obviously every move you make has a knock-on effect; it is a cumulative process. I have improvised, on the non-scripted Timecode. It can become entirely indulgent: actors smashing crockery and competing verbally. Nothing wrong with that, but it's probably exhausting. </p> <p>Turns out Bill's background is in photography and documentary. He's keen for me to meet him &amp; his wife and discuss concerns. We agree to have lunch in LA in a week's time. </p> <p><strong> Saturday September 23. An Italian restaurant on Melrose</strong><br> </p> <p> I meet husband &amp; wife team, Bill and Jennifer. She produces; she's also clearly Bill's mate, dramaturge, his everything. I feel shy, but it's OK. The Bennetts are clever and non-hysterical. We talk for several hours and I express some worries: will Burt and I be a coherent couple on screen? </p> <p><strong> Sunday September 24. Cocktails with money men </strong><br> </p> <p> I am to meet the financiers in a very dark bar in the Beverly Wilshire hotel. Drinks and light chatter. Except, there are 12 of them and one of me, so my manager comes too. Bill's very softly spoken, and the French aren't quite catching his introductions. We sit, peering at each other, in the low light. Bill kicks things off by saying: \"Well, we had lunch with Saffron yesterday, and she pointed out that the script is rather erotic.\" From a three-hour lunch, this is what he focuses on. And then Jennifer, to my left, chimes in: \"Yes, I thought that was rather a strange thing to say!\" </p> <p>Excuse me, but have I invented the five love scenes, one shower scene plus a blowjob involving four different characters? As the writer/producers of this drama, I got the impression they were going for a vaguely sensual psychological thriller. I give up, and speak French to the French, asking them about their families. After 90 minutes, we're all conversing, and eventually we bid farewell with slaps on backs, saying: \"We see you in New Orleans.\" Jennifer clasps me to her and says: \"I don't know how you do it, how you do it.\" I wonder what? \"Talking to them like that, fabulous.\" </p> <p>I drive away feeling bemused. </p> <p>Now I have to decide whether this is an interesting challenge, or merely suicide. Decide to give it a go. </p> <p><strong> Monday October 9. More drinks </strong><br> </p> <p> Tonight I am to meet Peter Facinelli, who is to play Jimmy. So watch The Big Kahuna, a three-hander with Facinelli, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito. Peter's very good in it; disingenuous and devoutly religious, nice, alongside their cynicism. </p> <p>We meet in yet another bar. He happens to be stunning, elements of Cruise and Paul Newman in his face. I am keen to meet Burt, too, but he's in Florida, so I guess I've taken the plunge, sight unseen. I hope we get on. I expect him to be macho, right-wing, and have little time for us. Bill assures me that Burt is unpretentious, clever, complex, and looking forward to improvising. His stories do precede him, though. I am a little fearful. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday October 24. New Orleans</strong><br> </p> <p> We're rehearsing in the house of Francis Ford Coppola. The entire Aussie directing department is living there. The kitchen's impressive, bottles of his wine all over the place. Coppola has this place as an occasional home, and specifically wants film-makers to make use of it. It is a tall, dark, stone house, hidden behind shutters. </p> <p>There's a courtyard where we base ourselves. Peter, Bill and I sit around a garden table. It is quiet and a little stiff at first. Peter does not speak much, lots of smoking and flashing eyes. So I think of the heart of the story: Charlie's devastatingly destructive jealousy. </p> <p>I mention Leontes. I don't go quite so far as to pluck extracts, for I can see this is not going down well. My voice withers and tails off. I assure them that I'm not well-versed in the classics. Sure they're thinking: \"Bloody Europeans.\" </p> <p>Peter eventually opens up and we start to work our way through the script, just in broad strokes. All goes well until a car park sequence. Peter suggests the choreography of a shot, as well as the dialogue: \"Well, Lily's walking back to her car and I'm filling my trunk and maybe the audience spot me before she does and the camera's over her shoulder, her POV of me in fact...\" </p> <p>Bill just stares, and is terribly quiet. Us actors exchange looks. Eventually he says: \"I am the director, you are an actor, you never, ever discuss Camera. Cameras are nothing to do with you, do you understand?\" There is a silence. I feel we have established something. </p> <p><strong> Monday October 30. Burt's in town</strong><br> </p> <p> Today we rehearse, as a complete cast, at Coppola's. Burt walks in, stylish in black, and grasps my hand firmly: \"I've been having a little festival of your movies in my room, and you just keep getting better 'n' better.\" He has more charm in his little finger than most of us encounter in a lifetime. I feel immensely shy, and full of angst at the thought of what he might have seen. We all have our skeletons. </p> <p>George DiCenzo, a razor-sharp, east coast Italian, plays Burt's private eye. George is America's foremost drama teacher, and dramaturge. When he can't take class, De Niro steps in for him. I imagine that he would be every non-neurotic director's dream. George exudes a formidable intelligence, and a discerning eye. He mentions Leontes, and I love him. </p> <p>Mike Starr, a large Irish New Yorker, plays Burt's warm but lethal right-hand man. He is a puppy around George and Burt. I enjoy the lack of machismo in the air. There is a sense of competing, but on a level of verbal wit which is amusing to observe. </p> <p>My first impressions of Burt are of a schism existing between the gentle and the fiery. His eyes are troubled, but incredibly warm. Most apparent is his eloquence, his love of literature, and of the south. He gives me a James Lee Burke special edition, given to him by Burke. And a southern booklist. </p> <p>The improvisation worries us all. Bill assures us that by the end of the week, when we get to work, we will all find a voice. He says he's seen it happen with actors time and again, working in this way. And once we stop, he's sure that we won't want to work in any way but this. </p> <p>I'm not surprised that Burt is anxious; he has, perhaps, the most to lose. </p> <p><strong> Thursday November 2. Raw Hide </strong><br> </p> <p> Today we sit on sofas and an actor playing the attorney pops in to meet us. Burt's got his don't-fuck-with-me black cashmere on. We discuss detail: intimate elements of Charlie, Jimmy, Lily, the LeBlanc marriage, and the like. Then things escalate in a certain way: Jimmy's vocal, Charlie's vocal, voices are raised and, suddenly, detail becomes contentious. Bill suggests to \"Charlie\" that they step outside. Rather a brave idea I think. </p> <p>\"Oh, you're asking the wrong person to step outside,\" he responds, hitching his sleeves, plus a hoik of the trousers, and they're off, into the courtyard. Me, Peter and the attorney who just walked in sit in stunned silence. </p> <p>For 45 minutes. </p> <p>We hear a thud at one point, but realise it's just a fist hitting a wall. We then witness, through the French windows, the two men embracing, and in they come, saying roll on Sunday, first day of filming. We all then embrace, of course, cashmere on cashmere, and off we go to spend several days in a state of lonely anxiety. </p> <p><strong> Friday November 3</strong><br> </p> <p> Burt has invited me to dinner. We go to a French place, and, as we enter, the diners sing Keep Those Wagons Rolling. He has great tales from his days as a young New York theatre naif. Tennessee wanted to sleep with him, and he unwittingly declined Garbo. And like LL Cool J, he has met every president. Many Reagan/Clinton/Carter stories later, he invites me to a boxing match in Biloxi. Another thing that Lily loves, of course. </p> <p><strong> Monday November 5. First day </strong><br> </p> <p> Have obviously peaked by the time I reach the make-up trailer. They began yesterday without me, so feel shy around the crew; a newcomer. Watch \"Charlie\" kick the shit out of \"Jimmy\" in rather a well-choreographed punch-up. The atmosphere is good and calm. We are shooting in the French Quarter's magnificent marble courthouse, where JFK was made. Six hours later it becomes clear that the tropical storms have flummoxed us and shooting cannot continue. I get out Deliverance and go home to watch it. Feel I have some catching up to do as I've only seen Burt in The Mean Machine. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday November 6. Back to the courthouse</strong><br> </p> <p> Lunch with Burt and Big Mike Starr. Do you know, they have drive-through daiquiri bars here. At around 4pm it becomes clear that trouble is afoot. The make-up trailer is a hotbed of gossip. I've yet to shoot and word is that production has ground to a halt. We speculate on the hold-up when word comes through on the walkie that another punch-up has occurred. Blimey. It's only day three. </p> <p>Transpires that the male leads, both of whom I'm rather fond of at this point, have had crew members confused, blurring the edges between rehearsal and reality. The stills woman has got great shots apparently, but the negative may have to be destroyed. The director also bore the brunt a little, and again I marvel at his fortitude. Hours of discussion in trailers ensue, and I go and talk to a fellow actor about anger management. </p> <p>Finally, in near-dusk, I do a shot of my foot stepping out of a car and crossing a construction site. </p> <p><strong> Thursday November 9. Shrapnel damage</strong><br> </p> <p> We're on to nights - and in Lafayette cemetery. Because of the city's geological make-up, bodies are never laid to rest below ground. Beautiful tombs abound. </p> <p>There are firearms involved tonight. An attacker shoots Burt, I shoot the attacker. I have a fabricated cleavage, and wear very little, Savannah-style. There is a character in Savannah, the TV series, who has a great sashay, and says \"Pish-posh\" a lot. She is my motivation. Pity no one here's seen the show. </p> <p>A discussion is held, in the dark, over whether to use full loads [of explosive] in the guns. Burt shows us a trick he does, loved by his 11-year-old. Holding his nose, he blocks one ear, and the sound of a wet, snotty coastline can be heard, whistling through his passages - he had one ear drum blown out in Italy, the other in Mexico, and most of an eyeball in Spain. He urges the director not to use a full load. We all listen, the stunt guys take note, and I am deeply impressed. As union reps go, you could not find a better one. </p> <p>So, we shoot in the cemetery with quarter loads. The balaclava-clad man fires, Burt falls, and I aim at the attacker's heart. However, Burt's squib explodes, and I think that half my face has fallen off. I look around for sympathy/assurance/blah-de-blah. The nurse pulls me to her bosom, and puts out the smouldering embers. The camera op's nose is burnt, and my cheek is radiating heat. Poor Bill, who's not used guns before, is appalled. They wrap me in a duvet, and layer on more foundation over the burn. </p> <p>On to the next shot. The camera op gets to wear a plastic visor for the ensuing set-ups. He and I are veterans and have bonded. I, by now, am so scared of the squibs that I turn away each time Burt's chest explodes, anticipating, and turning before he's shot. </p> <p><strong> Monday November 13. Chez LeBlanc</strong><br> </p> <p> I am in the LeBlanc house today, with Burt. We're here all week and it's a good, grand environment. Very like the sets in Savannah, which still no one has seen. There is a creaky start, but by the evening the scenes are becoming something. I'm not sure what, but I have a vocabulary that is not my own. </p> <p>It is slightly trance-like, working in this way. Burt is formidable; very much alive. He thinks this is the most exciting way of working; like flying when it's good, inviting suicide when bad. </p> <p>I had thought, back in rehearsal, I would be up all night writing very clever monologues and then attempting to casually slip them in. But no, maybe I'm too lazy, or maybe I've decided to trust Bill. </p> <p><strong> Thursday November 16</strong><br> </p> <p> I have the first of several \"love\" scenes today, and more next week with two other men. </p> <p><strong> Friday November 17. Boxing in Biloxi</strong><br> </p> <p> Burt has hired a 14-seater, sparkly white limo/people carrier, stocked with oysters, Golden Goose rum and Po-boy sandwiches. We drive to Biloxi in a storm with a driver who gets lost. We almost reach Florida, and do a U-turn. Anxious phonecalls come through from the fight promoter saying they can't start until we get there. Blimey, no pressure. </p> <p>Finally we hear the prelims have begun, which is a shame because I'm dying to see George Foreman's daughter: she's due to fight Ali's offspring soon. We miss her. And then we miss a bloke called Potato-head or Pickle or something. My boyfriend is here, a Newcastle man, and he's decided, from the poster, that the guy must be a Geordie. And then we hear that former world heavyweight Larry Holmes is in the ring. This is getting desperate. He's the one who invited Burt. I'm thinking this is like an exotic school trip, with sandwiches and everything. We've crossed into Mississippi, when sirens approach and we're given a police escort right into the arena. Burt tells us he will now become a complete redneck, and apologises for it in advance. </p> <p>As we take our ringside seats, they announce Mr Reynolds' arrival over the tannoy. He is a god in Biloxi. The crowd erupts. Holmes is on round eight, the sweat's flying and I'm loving the buzz of it. Holmes glances over at Burt, and knocks the guy out. We've been in our seats for 30 seconds and it's all over. There are girls in fur bikinis all over us to get a Burt thigh to perch on for a photograph. We've driven through a storm, across a state, and the fight's over. And the girls keep coming. </p> <p>They wear little white towels around their thongs, presumably for warmth, and then whip them off when they reach Burt. He's a little embarrassed, having told me about the campaigning he did for Gloria Steinem in the 1970s. </p> <p>We go to the shabby backstage rooms and Holmes embraces Burt, saying: \"Where were you man? I couldn't hold that bum up for much longer.\" </p> <p><strong> Sunday November 19. The Artist Formerly Known As</strong><br> </p> <p> We have drinks with Burt &amp; friends, then dinner, then more drinks. At a late point, a young woman sashays up and says to Reynolds: \"Oh you are one sexy motherfucker...\" Grins all round. She continues: \"There's a guy outside that I wanna screw and I was wond'rin' if I could have your autograph for his mama.\" She then steps outside, with the signature, leans against the glass window, and gyrates against this guy. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday November 21</strong><br> </p> <p> It is now clear Burt is a socialist at heart; not merely the Steinem involvement, but also the American Indian Movement, and more. Little did I know back in September. </p> <p><strong> Thursday November 30. Bouffant blues</strong><br> </p> <p> Burt has wrapped now, so it's me and Jimmy here on in. We are at the Saturn bar, one of many roach-infested haunts we spend our days shooting in, with me just loving it all, the whole vibe; each place full of stinky musician history. </p> <p>In this scene, Jimmy and Lily are on a platonic first date. I notice that Jimmy's hair resembles David Ginola's in the L'Or\u00e9al ads. Remarkably clean and soft and zzhussy. I then see him grab the mirror before each take and zzhussh it some more. By now it's got great volume, in fact it's added inches. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday December 6. Scenes from a mall</strong><br> </p> <p> We are at the car park; the scene which was much discussed the ominous day one of rehearsal. I have not dared refer to \"Camera\" from that day on. Occasionally I ask the director of photography about lens size. </p> <p>We're on a tight two-shot. The image is: over my shoulder on to Jimmy's face, I am in my Lexus, leaning out, he's resting his chin on the wing mirror, so the camera holds my reflected image in frame, just below Jimmy's. As they set up, I see him swinging the wing mirror in and out, turning the reflection away from camera, and then back again. By now I do not find him disingenuous. We go for a take and, lo and behold, halfway through he swings the mirror in, and the rest plays as a tight single. When we cut, I thank him for obscuring my image for half the scene. Oh, he says, sorry, I didn't mean to do that. I then watch him for a while. See the cogs going, and catching me clocking him, he comes over to fess up, saying: \"You know what, I did mean to do it; I thought it would be a neat shot.\" </p> <p><strong> Sunday December 10 </strong><br> </p> <p> I have a day off and Facinelli comes to see me when he's wrapped. I like him in these quiet moments when he doesn't have a cinematic agenda. He is a fine actor, and will be wonderful as Jimmy. Agitated, and concerned about the music chosen for our Cajun dancing, he's had an altercation with one of the producers. She's basically told him where to go, and to let her produce. He comes to my room a little shaken, saying: \"And I thought Burt was frightening.\" I think of making the producer a badge: \"Scarier than Burt.\" Think she'd like that. Better wait until the last day though. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday December 19. It's a wrap </strong><br> </p> <p> Tonight is the coldest Louisana's had for 10 years. What happened to the steamy, sultry south? We set up for another shoot, this time in the swamp.

Am immensely relieved. </p> <p>We then have a shot of Big Mike Starr firing a pump action at me. I'm wearing a skirt and T-shirt. The crew are wrapped in blankets with visors across foreheads. I look around, as I dive for the door, note the self-protective efforts of the crew, and then feel a cannonball force blow the wall to pieces. We are in a wooden hut that now has to be rebuilt. The crew, post-shot, are covered in great chunks of wood and plaster. I'm a bit scared. They always save these shots for the last night. </p> <p>We work until 11 on Wednesday morning, and sing carols on the barge, all the way back to unit base.

      "bodyText": "September 2000 I am sent a script of Tempted, an improvised film, to be shot in New Orleans. It is for the role of Lily LeBlanc, wife of Charlie - Burt Reynolds - a nouveau riche property developer. In fact, it is a non-script; it is a 60-page treatment of a contemporary thriller, with no dialogue on the page, hence the improv. Each scene is simply a description of what, emotionally, takes place. Charlie LeBlanc is a man eaten up with jealousy, obsessed with the idea that, given half a chance, his wife may cheat on him. A young character called Jimmy is paid to attempt to seduce Lily. Charlie promises more money if he's successful than if he's not. Over the course of five or six days, the trio's lives fall apart. They are all morally ambiguous and deception goes deep. Tempted's writer-director Bill Bennett made Kiss or Kill, an Aussie road movie, in this improvised fashion. I call Bill in New Orleans where he's prepping, and he tells me that Kiss or Kill was shot completely out of sequence, and entirely looped. The whole thing. This horrifies me. In orthodox film-making, you never shoot sequentially - but with improv, obviously every move you make has a knock-on effect; it is a cumulative process. I have improvised, on the non-scripted Timecode. It can become entirely indulgent: actors smashing crockery and competing verbally. Nothing wrong with that, but it's probably exhausting. Turns out Bill's background is in photography and documentary. He's keen for me to meet him &amp; his wife and discuss concerns. We agree to have lunch in LA in a week's time. Saturday September 23. An Italian restaurant on Melrose I meet husband &amp; wife team, Bill and Jennifer. She produces; she's also clearly Bill's mate, dramaturge, his everything. I feel shy, but it's OK. The Bennetts are clever and non-hysterical. We talk for several hours and I express some worries: will Burt and I be a coherent couple on screen? Sunday September 24. Cocktails with money men I am to meet the financiers in a very dark bar in the Beverly Wilshire hotel. Drinks and light chatter. Except, there are 12 of them and one of me, so my manager comes too. Bill's very softly spoken, and the French aren't quite catching his introductions. We sit, peering at each other, in the low light. Bill kicks things off by saying: \"Well, we had lunch with Saffron yesterday, and she pointed out that the script is rather erotic.\" From a three-hour lunch, this is what he focuses on. And then Jennifer, to my left, chimes in: \"Yes, I thought that was rather a strange thing to say!\" Excuse me, but have I invented the five love scenes, one shower scene plus a blowjob involving four different characters? As the writer/producers of this drama, I got the impression they were going for a vaguely sensual psychological thriller. I give up, and speak French to the French, asking them about their families. After 90 minutes, we're all conversing, and eventually we bid farewell with slaps on backs, saying: \"We see you in New Orleans.\" Jennifer clasps me to her and says: \"I don't know how you do it, how you do it.\" I wonder what? \"Talking to them like that, fabulous.\" I drive away feeling bemused. Now I have to decide whether this is an interesting challenge, or merely suicide. Decide to give it a go. Monday October 9. More drinks Tonight I am to meet Peter Facinelli, who is to play Jimmy. So watch The Big Kahuna, a three-hander with Facinelli, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito. Peter's very good in it; disingenuous and devoutly religious, nice, alongside their cynicism. We meet in yet another bar. He happens to be stunning, elements of Cruise and Paul Newman in his face. I am keen to meet Burt, too, but he's in Florida, so I guess I've taken the plunge, sight unseen. I hope we get on. I expect him to be macho, right-wing, and have little time for us. Bill assures me that Burt is unpretentious, clever, complex, and looking forward to improvising. His stories do precede him, though. I am a little fearful. Tuesday October 24. New Orleans We're rehearsing in the house of Francis Ford Coppola. The entire Aussie directing department is living there. The kitchen's impressive, bottles of his wine all over the place. Coppola has this place as an occasional home, and specifically wants film-makers to make use of it. It is a tall, dark, stone house, hidden behind shutters. There's a courtyard where we base ourselves. Peter, Bill and I sit around a garden table. It is quiet and a little stiff at first. Peter does not speak much, lots of smoking and flashing eyes. So I think of the heart of the story: Charlie's devastatingly destructive jealousy. I mention Leontes. I don't go quite so far as to pluck extracts, for I can see this is not going down well. My voice withers and tails off. I assure them that I'm not well-versed in the classics. Sure they're thinking: \"Bloody Europeans.\" Peter eventually opens up and we start to work our way through the script, just in broad strokes. All goes well until a car park sequence. Peter suggests the choreography of a shot, as well as the dialogue: \"Well, Lily's walking back to her car and I'm filling my trunk and maybe the audience spot me before she does and the camera's over her shoulder, her POV of me in fact...\" Bill just stares, and is terribly quiet. Us actors exchange looks. Eventually he says: \"I am the director, you are an actor, you never, ever discuss Camera. Cameras are nothing to do with you, do you understand?\" There is a silence. I feel we have established something. Monday October 30. Burt's in town Today we rehearse, as a complete cast, at Coppola's. Burt walks in, stylish in black, and grasps my hand firmly: \"I've been having a little festival of your movies in my room, and you just keep getting better 'n' better.\" He has more charm in his little finger than most of us encounter in a lifetime. I feel immensely shy, and full of angst at the thought of what he might have seen. We all have our skeletons. George DiCenzo, a razor-sharp, east coast Italian, plays Burt's private eye. George is America's foremost drama teacher, and dramaturge. When he can't take class, De Niro steps in for him. I imagine that he would be every non-neurotic director's dream. George exudes a formidable intelligence, and a discerning eye. He mentions Leontes, and I love him. Mike Starr, a large Irish New Yorker, plays Burt's warm but lethal right-hand man. He is a puppy around George and Burt. I enjoy the lack of machismo in the air. There is a sense of competing, but on a level of verbal wit which is amusing to observe. My first impressions of Burt are of a schism existing between the gentle and the fiery. His eyes are troubled, but incredibly warm. Most apparent is his eloquence, his love of literature, and of the south. He gives me a James Lee Burke special edition, given to him by Burke. And a southern booklist. The improvisation worries us all. Bill assures us that by the end of the week, when we get to work, we will all find a voice. He says he's seen it happen with actors time and again, working in this way. And once we stop, he's sure that we won't want to work in any way but this. I'm not surprised that Burt is anxious; he has, perhaps, the most to lose. Thursday November 2. Raw Hide Today we sit on sofas and an actor playing the attorney pops in to meet us. Burt's got his don't-fuck-with-me black cashmere on. We discuss detail: intimate elements of Charlie, Jimmy, Lily, the LeBlanc marriage, and the like. Then things escalate in a certain way: Jimmy's vocal, Charlie's vocal, voices are raised and, suddenly, detail becomes contentious. Bill suggests to \"Charlie\" that they step outside. Rather a brave idea I think. \"Oh, you're asking the wrong person to step outside,\" he responds, hitching his sleeves, plus a hoik of the trousers, and they're off, into the courtyard. Me, Peter and the attorney who just walked in sit in stunned silence. For 45 minutes. We hear a thud at one point, but realise it's just a fist hitting a wall. We then witness, through the French windows, the two men embracing, and in they come, saying roll on Sunday, first day of filming. We all then embrace, of course, cashmere on cashmere, and off we go to spend several days in a state of lonely anxiety. Friday November 3 Burt has invited me to dinner. We go to a French place, and, as we enter, the diners sing Keep Those Wagons Rolling. He has great tales from his days as a young New York theatre naif. Tennessee wanted to sleep with him, and he unwittingly declined Garbo. And like LL Cool J, he has met every president. Many Reagan/Clinton/Carter stories later, he invites me to a boxing match in Biloxi. Another thing that Lily loves, of course. Monday November 5. First day Have obviously peaked by the time I reach the make-up trailer. They began yesterday without me, so feel shy around the crew; a newcomer. Watch \"Charlie\" kick the shit out of \"Jimmy\" in rather a well-choreographed punch-up. The atmosphere is good and calm. We are shooting in the French Quarter's magnificent marble courthouse, where JFK was made. Six hours later it becomes clear that the tropical storms have flummoxed us and shooting cannot continue. I get out Deliverance and go home to watch it. Feel I have some catching up to do as I've only seen Burt in The Mean Machine. Tuesday November 6. Back to the courthouse Lunch with Burt and Big Mike Starr. Do you know, they have drive-through daiquiri bars here. At around 4pm it becomes clear that trouble is afoot. The make-up trailer is a hotbed of gossip. I've yet to shoot and word is that production has ground to a halt. We speculate on the hold-up when word comes through on the walkie that another punch-up has occurred. Blimey. It's only day three. Transpires that the male leads, both of whom I'm rather fond of at this point, have had crew members confused, blurring the edges between rehearsal and reality. The stills woman has got great shots apparently, but the negative may have to be destroyed. The director also bore the brunt a little, and again I marvel at his fortitude. Hours of discussion in trailers ensue, and I go and talk to a fellow actor about anger management. Finally, in near-dusk, I do a shot of my foot stepping out of a car and crossing a construction site. Thursday November 9. Shrapnel damage We're on to nights - and in Lafayette cemetery. Because of the city's geological make-up, bodies are never laid to rest below ground. Beautiful tombs abound. There are firearms involved tonight. An attacker shoots Burt, I shoot the attacker. I have a fabricated cleavage, and wear very little, Savannah-style. There is a character in Savannah, the TV series, who has a great sashay, and says \"Pish-posh\" a lot. She is my motivation. Pity no one here's seen the show. A discussion is held, in the dark, over whether to use full loads [of explosive] in the guns. Burt shows us a trick he does, loved by his 11-year-old. Holding his nose, he blocks one ear, and the sound of a wet, snotty coastline can be heard, whistling through his passages - he had one ear drum blown out in Italy, the other in Mexico, and most of an eyeball in Spain. He urges the director not to use a full load. We all listen, the stunt guys take note, and I am deeply impressed. As union reps go, you could not find a better one. So, we shoot in the cemetery with quarter loads. The balaclava-clad man fires, Burt falls, and I aim at the attacker's heart. However, Burt's squib explodes, and I think that half my face has fallen off. I look around for sympathy/assurance/blah-de-blah. The nurse pulls me to her bosom, and puts out the smouldering embers. The camera op's nose is burnt, and my cheek is radiating heat. Poor Bill, who's not used guns before, is appalled. They wrap me in a duvet, and layer on more foundation over the burn. On to the next shot. The camera op gets to wear a plastic visor for the ensuing set-ups. He and I are veterans and have bonded. I, by now, am so scared of the squibs that I turn away each time Burt's chest explodes, anticipating, and turning before he's shot. Monday November 13. Chez LeBlanc I am in the LeBlanc house today, with Burt. We're here all week and it's a good, grand environment. Very like the sets in Savannah, which still no one has seen. There is a creaky start, but by the evening the scenes are becoming something. I'm not sure what, but I have a vocabulary that is not my own. It is slightly trance-like, working in this way. Burt is formidable; very much alive. He thinks this is the most exciting way of working; like flying when it's good, inviting suicide when bad. I had thought, back in rehearsal, I would be up all night writing very clever monologues and then attempting to casually slip them in. But no, maybe I'm too lazy, or maybe I've decided to trust Bill. Thursday November 16 I have the first of several \"love\" scenes today, and more next week with two other men. Friday November 17. Boxing in Biloxi Burt has hired a 14-seater, sparkly white limo/people carrier, stocked with oysters, Golden Goose rum and Po-boy sandwiches. We drive to Biloxi in a storm with a driver who gets lost. We almost reach Florida, and do a U-turn. Anxious phonecalls come through from the fight promoter saying they can't start until we get there. Blimey, no pressure. Finally we hear the prelims have begun, which is a shame because I'm dying to see George Foreman's daughter: she's due to fight Ali's offspring soon. We miss her. And then we miss a bloke called Potato-head or Pickle or something. My boyfriend is here, a Newcastle man, and he's decided, from the poster, that the guy must be a Geordie.

She continues: \"There's a guy outside that I wanna screw and I was wond'rin' if I could have your autograph for his mama.\" She then steps outside, with the signature, leans against the glass window, and gyrates against this guy. Tuesday November 21 It is now clear Burt is a socialist at heart; not merely the Steinem involvement, but also the American Indian Movement, and more. Little did I know back in September. Thursday November 30. Bouffant blues Burt has wrapped now, so it's me and Jimmy here on in.

      "body": "<p>Two Labour key policies - ending the blight of drugs and cutting traffic congestion - were in disarray last night after Whitehall was forced to admit it had no way of judging whether it was meeting its targets.</p> <p>The admission comes in a series of papers released by government departments on the details of broad public service targets published in the summer, and how they will be met. Together the targets, most of them set to be met in 2004-05, amount to an early release of Labour's second-term manifesto.</p> <p>But Labour will be embarrassed by the revelation that four years after pledging a crusade against excess car use, the Department of Environment is still working both on how to measure changes in traffic congestion and what targets should be set.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office also conceded that the drugs tsar, Keith Hellawell, had no way yet of gauging whether he was making progress in meeting his key targets in the fight against drugs.</p> <p>The four main targets, including cutting drug use among young people by a quarter by 2005 were set two years ago. Even if this target were to be met, more than 6% of 18- to 25-year-olds will take class A drugs in 2005.</p> <p>The other drugs targets centre on cutting reoffending by drug users, reducing the availability of drugs and increasing participation by young people.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office said civil servants were still working on how to measure progress. The lack of any reliable statistical base raised the question of how the drugs tsar set the targets in the first place and how the government can know if its policies are working.</p> <p>The pledge to cut traffic congestion was also in doubt. Early in the parliament, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, asked to be judged on whether he reduced the number of car journeys.</p> <p>Ministers have now changed tack and promised by 2010 to reduce traffic congestion on the inter-urban trunk network and in large urban areas. The Department of Environment admits \"the methodology for collection\" of such figures is still to be finalised.</p> <p>The targets also reveal the extent to which ministers recognise the scale of the struggle ahead in raising stan dards in schools. By 2004, 75% of schoolchildren in England's 500 worst performing schools will still not achieve 5 GCSE at grades A to C.</p> <p>In all, ministers have set more than 200 measurable targets, many of which may come back to haunt the government if they are not met by the target date. The government has already suffered criticism for not yet meeting two of its five key election pledges.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two Labour key policies - ending the blight of drugs and cutting traffic congestion - were in disarray last night after Whitehall was forced to admit it had no way of judging whether it was meeting its targets. The admission comes in a series of papers released by government departments on the details of broad public service targets published in the summer, and how they will be met. Together the targets, most of them set to be met in 2004-05, amount to an early release of Labour's second-term manifesto. But Labour will be embarrassed by the revelation that four years after pledging a crusade against excess car use, the Department of Environment is still working both on how to measure changes in traffic congestion and what targets should be set. The Cabinet Office also conceded that the drugs tsar, Keith Hellawell, had no way yet of gauging whether he was making progress in meeting his key targets in the fight against drugs. The four main targets, including cutting drug use among young people by a quarter by 2005 were set two years ago. Even if this target were to be met, more than 6% of 18- to 25-year-olds will take class A drugs in 2005. The other drugs targets centre on cutting reoffending by drug users, reducing the availability of drugs and increasing participation by young people. The Cabinet Office said civil servants were still working on how to measure progress. The lack of any reliable statistical base raised the question of how the drugs tsar set the targets in the first place and how the government can know if its policies are working. The pledge to cut traffic congestion was also in doubt. Early in the parliament, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, asked to be judged on whether he reduced the number of car journeys. Ministers have now changed tack and promised by 2010 to reduce traffic congestion on the inter-urban trunk network and in large urban areas. The Department of Environment admits \"the methodology for collection\" of such figures is still to be finalised. The targets also reveal the extent to which ministers recognise the scale of the struggle ahead in raising stan dards in schools. By 2004, 75% of schoolchildren in England's 500 worst performing schools will still not achieve 5 GCSE at grades A to C. In all, ministers have set more than 200 measurable targets, many of which may come back to haunt the government if they are not met by the target date. The government has already suffered criticism for not yet meeting two of its five key election pledges.",

After three tense days of negotiation on the tarmac, during which four of the flight crew escaped by climbing down a rope from the cockpit window, the hijackers gave themselves up and the remaining hostages were freed. Opening the case for the prosecution, Bruce Houlder QC said the majority of the men claimed to belong to a group called the Young Intellectuals of Afghanistan, who were committed to freeing their country of the ruling Taliban regime, restoring democracy and improving the lot of Afghan women. Mr Houlder told the jury that during the trial they would hear harrowing accounts of the brutality of life in Afghanistan, but warned the seven women and five men to \"keep their feet on the ground\". He said: \"Those who chose to oppose the Taliban or plot against them are dicing with death, with their lives and the lives of their families. \"Remember what they are - a group of people who follow a particularly extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism. \"Fundamentalism takes a perverted form in some men and some in the Taliban are capable of the most extreme cruelty and barbarity.\" But he added: \"It would take a cold heart to remain unmoved by the plight of these defendants. The fact that their lives have become a misery in their country and they have suffered deprivation - stories of how their homes and businesses were either bombed or burgled - does not provide justification for the crime committed. \"Sympathy is something all of us will no doubt experience - for the passengers and the accused. But keep it in its proper place.\" He said that by taking over the plane by force using firearms and hand grenades the accused had put the lives of every person on board at risk. He added that the 12 men, many of whom had family on board, were no ordinary asylum seekers who surrendered themselves to the authorities on reaching British shores. Instead they had kept more than 150 people hostage in the most extreme conditions for more than three days. The prosecution said the jury would hear evidence from a number of those on board the aircraft during the hijack, including a passenger who would describe how the hijackers had threatened to shoot them unless they stayed in their seats and kept their heads down. Mr Houlder said that various acts of violence had been committed by the hijackers, the most serious of which occurred after they discovered the flight crew had escaped. Describing how \"bedlam had ensued\", Mr Houlder said the remaining crew were rounded up, trussed and beaten as they lay on the aircraft floor. The hijackers threatened to kill them, and all of the passengers on board, unless the escapees returned. The remaining stewards \"begged\" negotiators to \"do something to help\". One steward, who suffered a head wound in the alleged attack, was later shoved out of the plane with his hands still tied behind his back. While at Stansted airport the \"hysterical\" hijackers frequently threatened to throw the bodies of their hostages from the plane if their demands were not met. At one point, the gang's spokesman allegedly gave negotiators a one minute ultimatum to remove armed police from around the plane or they would kill some of the hostages.

David Fillingham, chief executive of North Staffordshire hospital, said the bodies had been placed in the makeshift morgue between Boxing Day and New Year's Eve. It had been set up a year earlier in case of major incidents during the millennium celebrations. But he said he had no idea that it was still being used. He added that no more than seven bodies, wrapped in shrouds and resting on rows of tables, had been stored at any one time. Mr Fillingham said: \"While the facility was adequate for the difficult position we could have faced at the millennium, I do not believe it is appropriate for normal circumstances.

It was hard to tell if he was boasting or desperate.</p> <p>But now the money is running out and the lights are going out as the power industry drama which has dogged the state for weeks becomes an emergency.</p> <p>At the heart of the saga of power, politics and a deregulation programme gone badly wrong are two privately owned utility companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity, which supply much of the state's power.</p> <p>When California's energy market was deregulated under legislation that came into effect in 1998, the two companies were forced to sell off most of their generating capacity - much of it to out-of-state groups.</p> <p>Under the new regime they had to buy in the bulk of their electricity supply and then sell it on to consumers. The snag was that while the price at which the utilities can sell electricity is tightly controlled, the wholesale market through which they purchase electricity has no such capping mechanism.</p> <p>Arguably, such a system was always an accident waiting to happen. Last month it did. Prices in the wholesale market rocketed to 10 times their level the previous December. The utilities were forced to sell electricity at levels well below what they were having to pay. They did eventually get permission to raise prices but by nothing like the amount they wanted.</p> <p>The utilities accuse the generators of exploiting a breakdown in the market system. The generators argue that they are part of the solution, not the problem, and that they, too, have bills to pay.</p> <p>While the arguments raged, the utilities ran up uncovered costs - the gap between what they were paying and receiving - put at more than $12bn. Efforts to find a solution by California's governor, Gray Davis, the Clinton administration's energy team, the utilities, the generators and the regulators have been going on for weeks.</p> <p>This week, the inevitable happened. On Tuesday SCE said that to conserve cash it would not meet almost $600m of debt and interest payment that had fallen due. The default meant the credit rating agencies slashed the rating on SCE and Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity to junk status. On Wednesday Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity also defaulted on part of its debt. It warned that it had debt payments totalling well over $2bn falling due in the next few weeks but had only $700m in its reserves.</p> <p>Chal Barnwell at the energy risk management systems company KWI said: \"It's lack of infrastructure - there hasn't been any significant plant built in California in 10 years - and an uncertain regulatory structure that has put them where they are.\"</p> <p>The week's events have pushed the two companies close to bankruptcy. It has made suppliers concerned about whether they will get paid for electricity they sell to the utilities. Coming on top of power shortages, blackouts were inevitable. The situation has also aroused concerns about the consequences forbanks that have lent heavily to the utility sector.</p> <p>The governor has authorised $400m to be spent buying electricity. Fortunately for California, the Canadian province of British Columbia has power to spare.</p> <p>Critics say short-term expedients will not solve the problem. That requires agreement over long-term supply contracts and who will foot the final bill - the generators, the utilities or the California taxpayer. So far no one is volunteering.</p> <p><b>America's richest state</b><br></p> <p>\u0095 The state's economy is equivalent in size to that of the world's 10th largest country. The average income is $20,500 (\u00a313,700); unemployment stands at 6.3%. The average house is worth $221,000</p> <p>\u0095 California has a Democratic governor and two Democratic senators. In the 2000 presidential election it voted for Al Gore. It has produced two former presidents, both Republican: Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon</p> <p>\u0095 At the cutting edge of new technology (Silicon Valley), and the heart of the entertainment industry (Hollywood), California was also the starting point of the radical and black power movements of the 60s. The writer Scott Bradfield described California as \"America squared\"</p> <p>\u0095 The first use of the name California was by the Spanish explorer Juan Cabrillo in 1542. By 1850 it had become the 31st US state</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"We are borrowing $1m an hour to keep the lights on,\" an official at a Californian utility observed last week. It was hard to tell if he was boasting or desperate. But now the money is running out and the lights are going out as the power industry drama which has dogged the state for weeks becomes an emergency. At the heart of the saga of power, politics and a deregulation programme gone badly wrong are two privately owned utility companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity, which supply much of the state's power. When California's energy market was deregulated under legislation that came into effect in 1998, the two companies were forced to sell off most of their generating capacity - much of it to out-of-state groups. Under the new regime they had to buy in the bulk of their electricity supply and then sell it on to consumers. The snag was that while the price at which the utilities can sell electricity is tightly controlled, the wholesale market through which they purchase electricity has no such capping mechanism. Arguably, such a system was always an accident waiting to happen. Last month it did. Prices in the wholesale market rocketed to 10 times their level the previous December. The utilities were forced to sell electricity at levels well below what they were having to pay. They did eventually get permission to raise prices but by nothing like the amount they wanted. The utilities accuse the generators of exploiting a breakdown in the market system. The generators argue that they are part of the solution, not the problem, and that they, too, have bills to pay. While the arguments raged, the utilities ran up uncovered costs - the gap between what they were paying and receiving - put at more than $12bn. Efforts to find a solution by California's governor, Gray Davis, the Clinton administration's energy team, the utilities, the generators and the regulators have been going on for weeks. This week, the inevitable happened. On Tuesday SCE said that to conserve cash it would not meet almost $600m of debt and interest payment that had fallen due. The default meant the credit rating agencies slashed the rating on SCE and Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity to junk status. On Wednesday Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity also defaulted on part of its debt. It warned that it had debt payments totalling well over $2bn falling due in the next few weeks but had only $700m in its reserves. Chal Barnwell at the energy risk management systems company KWI said: \"It's lack of infrastructure - there hasn't been any significant plant built in California in 10 years - and an uncertain regulatory structure that has put them where they are.\" The week's events have pushed the two companies close to bankruptcy. It has made suppliers concerned about whether they will get paid for electricity they sell to the utilities. Coming on top of power shortages, blackouts were inevitable. The situation has also aroused concerns about the consequences forbanks that have lent heavily to the utility sector. The governor has authorised $400m to be spent buying electricity. Fortunately for California, the Canadian province of British Columbia has power to spare. Critics say short-term expedients will not solve the problem. That requires agreement over long-term supply contracts and who will foot the final bill - the generators, the utilities or the California taxpayer. So far no one is volunteering. America's richest state \u0095 The state's economy is equivalent in size to that of the world's 10th largest country. The average income is $20,500 (\u00a313,700); unemployment stands at 6.3%. The average house is worth $221,000 \u0095 California has a Democratic governor and two Democratic senators. In the 2000 presidential election it voted for Al Gore. It has produced two former presidents, both Republican: Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon \u0095 At the cutting edge of new technology (Silicon Valley), and the heart of the entertainment industry (Hollywood), California was also the starting point of the radical and black power movements of the 60s. The writer Scott Bradfield described California as \"America squared\" \u0095 The first use of the name California was by the Spanish explorer Juan Cabrillo in 1542. By 1850 it had become the 31st US state",

That is not because the need for TV encounters is irrefutable or universally agreed. Our columnist Isabel Hilton made a spirited case against them on Wednesday. She feared they would dumb down elections. Good politics and good television, she argued, were not the same thing. TV debates were all about image, not issues. Unlike the United States, where the choice before voters was Gore or Bush, Britain was picking a parliament, not a president - so the parallels usually quoted did not apply. Labour's defence of Mr Blair's refusal echoes that. The debates would detract, it was said, from Labour's policy message, from the issues which really matter to people. Legal difficulties might arise if the nationalist parties were not included. And Britain, the prime minister's spokesman Lance Price irrefutably added, was not the US.</p> <p>But it wasn't the US on November 16 either - the day when the PM's chief press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, spoke of TV debates as \" a perfectly good thing in principle\". Neither was it the US on January 7, when Mr Blair told Sir David Frost that he was \"committed in principle\". Nor is the potential distraction factor any greater today than it was then. These objections to the principle of TV debates come much too late in the day to carry conviction. The most likely explanation is this: that Mr Blair has been hauled back by advisers who reminded him of the old political rule -never give your opponents a platform. The Conservatives took the same line when they were on top. Politicians may talk about principle, but in the end it always comes down to what suits their own political convenience.</p> <p>Elections should be run for the people, not for the politicians. And one part of that ought to be the voters' right to see those who aspire to lead them taking each other on. They may not be running for president, but in practice once in office they act more and more presidentially. The principle of primus inter pares no longer applies as it did. In a leaked memo last July, Mr Blair insisted not just that there needed to be initiatives on crime, defence and asylum but that he must be \"personally associated\" with them. There is always the risk that debates might descend into the sort of raucuous vacuity which characterises prime minister's questions. There is little hope that they'd prove as enlightening as those radio debates where the politicians take on the voters direct, like the one in 1983 when Mrs Diana Gould put Margaret Thatcher on the spot over the sinking of the Belgrano. Yet the fact that TV debates may fail to match that is no justification for saying they should not happen. If you ruled out every election device which politicians might try to misuse, there might not be very much left.</p> <p>As things stand, we can confidently expect that the same charade will take place in the general election of 2005, or whenever. Again, a great wall of irrevelancies will be erected against TV debates by those who fear they might lose from them, with all sorts of bogus technical issues raised about the formats. By then, though, Mr Straw's new electoral commission will be in business, and ideally equipped to frame a neutral and fair set of rules for such occasions. It may never be possible to force recalcitrant politicians to accept obligations which they fear might disadvantage them. But the chance of shaming those who duck out have never been better.</p>",

Elections should be run for the people, not for the politicians. And one part of that ought to be the voters' right to see those who aspire to lead them taking each other on. They may not be running for president, but in practice once in office they act more and more presidentially. The principle of primus inter pares no longer applies as it did. In a leaked memo last July, Mr Blair insisted not just that there needed to be initiatives on crime, defence and asylum but that he must be \"personally associated\" with them. There is always the risk that debates might descend into the sort of raucuous vacuity which characterises prime minister's questions. There is little hope that they'd prove as enlightening as those radio debates where the politicians take on the voters direct, like the one in 1983 when Mrs Diana Gould put Margaret Thatcher on the spot over the sinking of the Belgrano. Yet the fact that TV debates may fail to match that is no justification for saying they should not happen. If you ruled out every election device which politicians might try to misuse, there might not be very much left. As things stand, we can confidently expect that the same charade will take place in the general election of 2005, or whenever. Again, a great wall of irrevelancies will be erected against TV debates by those who fear they might lose from them, with all sorts of bogus technical issues raised about the formats. By then, though, Mr Straw's new electoral commission will be in business, and ideally equipped to frame a neutral and fair set of rules for such occasions. It may never be possible to force recalcitrant politicians to accept obligations which they fear might disadvantage them. But the chance of shaming those who duck out have never been better.",

In this she failed to mention hanging, thought that some criminals should be let out early, and honestly admitted that she had not yet worked out a policy on policing rural areas. Yesterday we got it. Her problem is that her party insists on having oodles more police, but on keeping taxes down. The answer? \"Police should spend time doing necessary paperwork in local villages, instead of whizzing through and going back to the station.\" So that's it! Clearly this masterplan is an extension of her \"cops in shops\" wheeze, which would have policemen sitting in Woolworth's on the off chance that someone would like to report a crime. Except that they'll be in rural settings. Cops in tea-shops! The Old Bill in barns! Pigs in pigsheds! Bobbies on bar-stools, the Filth in tilth! Something for nothing! Miss Widdecombe would have been a dazzling war-time improviser, sewing clothing made out of egg-boxes and making nutritious stews from acorns and mud.",

Marietta Bosch's lawyers argue that the Botswana appeal court judges - who come from England, Scotland, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa - should overturn the conviction because the state wrongly gave immunity from prosecution to a leading suspect in the killing in return for him agreeing to testify against Bosch. But the prosecution, which characterised the case as embracing the \"four Ls of murder - love, loot, lust and loathing\", says the evidence against Bosch is overwhelming. If she is executed, she will be the first woman hanged in Botswana in three decades. Bosch was sentenced to death a year ago after being convicted of murdering Maria Wolmarans in June 1996. The prosecution alleges that Bosch began an affair with Wolmarans' husband, Tienie, after the death of her own spouse. When Mr Wolmarans failed to deliver on a promise to divorce his wife, Bosch borrowed a gun from a friend in South Africa and shot her victim. The police investigation made no progress for several months until Bosch made two mistakes. She ordered a wedding dress after Mr Wolmarans secretly agreed to marry her, and she gave the murder weapon to her brother-in-law whose wife was said in court to loathe Bosch. When the woman found out about the gun and the dress she drew her own conclusion and took the weapon to the police. At her trial, Bosch said that she had brought the gun into the country on behalf of Hennie Coetzee, the general manager of a firm where Maria Wolmarans was financial manager. The defence claimed that Mr Coetzee shot Wolmarans on the eve of a company audit because she was about to disclose financial irregularities for which he was responsible. After Bosch's arrest, Mr Coetzee moved to Ghana. He returned to Botswana only after he was granted immunity from prosecution in return for testifying against her. But the defence was not told about the agreement before the trial. Yesterday, Bosch's British barrister, Desmond de Silva QC, who has won a reprieve from the hangman for more than 35 people around the globe, said that the prosecution's failure to disclose the deal was detrimental to a fair trial. \"The defence should have been served with a copy of the immunity.

      "body": "<p>'I'd like to thank Tom Hanks for voicing me, John Lasseter and the guys at Pixar for creating me, my agent, Buzz, Jessie, Mr Potato Head and the rest of the team - it was great working with you guys.\" That won't happen this year but we could be hearing Oscar acceptance speeches like this, perhaps complemented by computer-animated tears, in years to come. </p> <p>For the first time in 20 years, a new Academy award has been created: best animated feature. It will probably come into effect in 2002, for films of more than 70 minutes' length that are \"primarily animated\". Up until now, only animated short films - of which Creature Comforts and The Wrong Trousers are outstanding examples - could expect Academy recognition. But the new award means next year's crop of full-length animations are, for the first time, true Oscar contenders. </p> <p>Animators have been campaigning for years for Oscar recognition, but also harbour reservations about the award. \"It's a double-edged sword,\" says Dave Sproxton, managing director and co-founder of Britain's Aardman Animations, producers of last year's Chicken Run. \"It's a sign that animation is back on the agenda, and should mean we see more players in the field. But it could also relegate animated films to their own little ghetto, so they stand against each other and don't interfere with the 'real' pictures.\" </p> <p>In critical and box-office terms, animation is already giving \"real\" pictures a run for their money. Toy Story 2 was one of the top-grossing films worldwide last year, as well as a critical triumph; while Chicken Run and Dinosaur both took more than $100m in the US. But despite matching live-action films in the marketplace, animation has never come close at the Oscars. Animators often spend years crafting their product, only to see Phil Collins or Tim Rice walk off with an Oscar for best song. Only one animated feature has ever received a best picture nomination: Disney's Beauty and the Beast in 1991. It, too, won only in the music categories. </p> <p>Since about 1960, Disney has been the only studio regularly producing feature-length animation so, until recently, any Oscar would have been a one-horse race. Disney is the only studio to have received real Academy recognition for its features. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs received an honorary award in 1939 for having \"pioneered a great new entertainment field\", and, three years later, Fantasia received another. </p> <p>Disney's dominance once destroyed competition in the past, but its recent renaissance has had the opposite effect. Once the Mouse House bounced back with hits such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and particularly The Lion King - which took more than $760m worldwide - Disney's colossal revenues prompted other Hollywood studios to take another stab at the genre. </p> <p>Most have mimicked Disney's family-musical formula but few have consistently made it click. Fox put its weight behind Disney defector Don Bluth, whose Phoenix studio found sporadic success with Anastasia and An American Tail. However, last year's sci-fi epic Titan AE failed to recoup much of its $80m budget, sending Fox Animation into untimely closure. Warner Bros, still productive in TV animation, has experienced similar difficulty when apeing the Disney formula (Quest for Camelot, The King and I), but found critical success with original work (The Iron Giant). DreamWorks has fared better with The Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado and Antz, while TV tie-ins such as Rugrats, Pok\u00e9mon and South Park have also performed well at feature length. </p> <p>\"We've spent three or four years debating this award, but we had to wait until the industry was big enough to make it worthwhile,\" says John Pavlik of the Academy. \"That time is judged to have come, though the rules have been carefully calibrated to ensure competition.\" The best animation feature Oscar will only be given if eight or more eligible films are released in a year, and it will require a minimum of 16 releases to secure five nominees. The average number of US-produced animated features over the past decade, including the year 2000, has been seven. </p> <p>What the Oscar will hopefully encourage is variety, giving a financial boost to riskier projects and small or foreign players, as it has with live-action features. Japan, for example, has a fully fledged animation industry, producing everything from apocalyptic sci-fi adventures such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell to contemporary character dramas such as Perfect Blue and offbeat fantasies such as the widely acclaimed Princess Mononoke (the highest-grossing picture in Japan apart from Titanic). Many of these have gone on to find a niche in Western video markets (Mononoke even had a limited US theatrical release), but their technical sophistication and mature themes could have made them strong contenders for Oscar success. </p> <p>With a $240m Hollywood deal to their name, Aardman Animations is living proof of the difference an Oscar can make to a smaller player. \"We can't deny that the three Oscars Nick [Park] won from the Wallace and Gromit films helped pave the way to our deal with DreamWorks,\" says Dave Sproxton. Its forthcoming reworking of the tortoise and the hare fable could be a contender for the first award in 2002. </p> <p>Whatever the effects on the industry, there could be more problematic repercussions from the new Oscar stemming from the tricky term \"primarily animated\". With computer-generated images (CGI) increasingly blended into live-action films, the dividing line between the genres is likely to become more and more indeterminate. Take a movie such as Star Wars - The Phantom Menace. Real characters and virtual ones populate a combination of CGI and live sets. What percentage of the film is animated? How would such a percentage be determined? By drawing a firm line between the two, the Academy might be laying the ground for future legal disputes and bitter statistical warfare on a par with the US presidential elections. </p> <p>Producer Dennis Edwards, at Warner Animation, has already faced this problem. His latest project, Osmosis Jones (directed by the Farrelly brothers), about the struggle against the cold virus inside a human body, mixes animation with live action and is set for release this summer. \"I think our film meets the requirements and it doesn't really matter to me if it doesn't, but I'm sure it's going to get more difficult now that CGI is so widely used. To me, the film-making world is already a multimedia event. You take the best of all these worlds, live action, CGI, traditional hand-drawn animation, and combine them to make a new art form. I believe that's the future.\" </p> <p>\"That's definitely one of the wickets that's still sticky,\" says the Academy's John Pavlik. \"The original proposal has detailed guidelines about the way the competition will work, but the rules about what constitutes 'primarily animated' haven't been written yet.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "'I'd like to thank Tom Hanks for voicing me, John Lasseter and the guys at Pixar for creating me, my agent, Buzz, Jessie, Mr Potato Head and the rest of the team - it was great working with you guys.\" That won't happen this year but we could be hearing Oscar acceptance speeches like this, perhaps complemented by computer-animated tears, in years to come. For the first time in 20 years, a new Academy award has been created: best animated feature. It will probably come into effect in 2002, for films of more than 70 minutes' length that are \"primarily animated\". Up until now, only animated short films - of which Creature Comforts and The Wrong Trousers are outstanding examples - could expect Academy recognition. But the new award means next year's crop of full-length animations are, for the first time, true Oscar contenders. Animators have been campaigning for years for Oscar recognition, but also harbour reservations about the award. \"It's a double-edged sword,\" says Dave Sproxton, managing director and co-founder of Britain's Aardman Animations, producers of last year's Chicken Run. \"It's a sign that animation is back on the agenda, and should mean we see more players in the field. But it could also relegate animated films to their own little ghetto, so they stand against each other and don't interfere with the 'real' pictures.\" In critical and box-office terms, animation is already giving \"real\" pictures a run for their money. Toy Story 2 was one of the top-grossing films worldwide last year, as well as a critical triumph; while Chicken Run and Dinosaur both took more than $100m in the US. But despite matching live-action films in the marketplace, animation has never come close at the Oscars. Animators often spend years crafting their product, only to see Phil Collins or Tim Rice walk off with an Oscar for best song. Only one animated feature has ever received a best picture nomination: Disney's Beauty and the Beast in 1991. It, too, won only in the music categories. Since about 1960, Disney has been the only studio regularly producing feature-length animation so, until recently, any Oscar would have been a one-horse race. Disney is the only studio to have received real Academy recognition for its features. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs received an honorary award in 1939 for having \"pioneered a great new entertainment field\", and, three years later, Fantasia received another. Disney's dominance once destroyed competition in the past, but its recent renaissance has had the opposite effect. Once the Mouse House bounced back with hits such as Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and particularly The Lion King - which took more than $760m worldwide - Disney's colossal revenues prompted other Hollywood studios to take another stab at the genre. Most have mimicked Disney's family-musical formula but few have consistently made it click. Fox put its weight behind Disney defector Don Bluth, whose Phoenix studio found sporadic success with Anastasia and An American Tail. However, last year's sci-fi epic Titan AE failed to recoup much of its $80m budget, sending Fox Animation into untimely closure. Warner Bros, still productive in TV animation, has experienced similar difficulty when apeing the Disney formula (Quest for Camelot, The King and I), but found critical success with original work (The Iron Giant). DreamWorks has fared better with The Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado and Antz, while TV tie-ins such as Rugrats, Pok\u00e9mon and South Park have also performed well at feature length. \"We've spent three or four years debating this award, but we had to wait until the industry was big enough to make it worthwhile,\" says John Pavlik of the Academy. \"That time is judged to have come, though the rules have been carefully calibrated to ensure competition.\" The best animation feature Oscar will only be given if eight or more eligible films are released in a year, and it will require a minimum of 16 releases to secure five nominees. The average number of US-produced animated features over the past decade, including the year 2000, has been seven. What the Oscar will hopefully encourage is variety, giving a financial boost to riskier projects and small or foreign players, as it has with live-action features. Japan, for example, has a fully fledged animation industry, producing everything from apocalyptic sci-fi adventures such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell to contemporary character dramas such as Perfect Blue and offbeat fantasies such as the widely acclaimed Princess Mononoke (the highest-grossing picture in Japan apart from Titanic). Many of these have gone on to find a niche in Western video markets (Mononoke even had a limited US theatrical release), but their technical sophistication and mature themes could have made them strong contenders for Oscar success. With a $240m Hollywood deal to their name, Aardman Animations is living proof of the difference an Oscar can make to a smaller player. \"We can't deny that the three Oscars Nick [Park] won from the Wallace and Gromit films helped pave the way to our deal with DreamWorks,\" says Dave Sproxton. Its forthcoming reworking of the tortoise and the hare fable could be a contender for the first award in 2002. Whatever the effects on the industry, there could be more problematic repercussions from the new Oscar stemming from the tricky term \"primarily animated\". With computer-generated images (CGI) increasingly blended into live-action films, the dividing line between the genres is likely to become more and more indeterminate. Take a movie such as Star Wars - The Phantom Menace. Real characters and virtual ones populate a combination of CGI and live sets. What percentage of the film is animated? How would such a percentage be determined? By drawing a firm line between the two, the Academy might be laying the ground for future legal disputes and bitter statistical warfare on a par with the US presidential elections. Producer Dennis Edwards, at Warner Animation, has already faced this problem. His latest project, Osmosis Jones (directed by the Farrelly brothers), about the struggle against the cold virus inside a human body, mixes animation with live action and is set for release this summer. \"I think our film meets the requirements and it doesn't really matter to me if it doesn't, but I'm sure it's going to get more difficult now that CGI is so widely used. To me, the film-making world is already a multimedia event. You take the best of all these worlds, live action, CGI, traditional hand-drawn animation, and combine them to make a new art form. I believe that's the future.\" \"That's definitely one of the wickets that's still sticky,\" says the Academy's John Pavlik. \"The original proposal has detailed guidelines about the way the competition will work, but the rules about what constitutes 'primarily animated' haven't been written yet.\"",

The energy, consistency and utter mastery of technique that Darren Aronofsky shows in his adaptation of Requiem for a Dream reminded me of that legendary confidence. His agonising and unflinchingly grim portrait of drug abuse, taken from a novel by Hubert Selby Jr (with whom Aronofsky co-wrote the screenplay), is a formally pleasing piece of work - if pleasing can possibly be the right word; it shows an engaging young man's descent into heroin addiction at the same time as his elderly mother becomes hooked on diet pills in the grotesquely forlorn hope of regaining her youthful figure in order to appear on a TV game show. </p> <p>It's a repulsive and yet somehow elegantly considered symmetry of ironies, pre-figured by Aronofsky's split-screen argument through a locked door between Harry (Jared Leto) and his mom Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), who is refusing to let Harry hock the TV to buy drugs. Gradually, inexorably, Harry and Sara's lives unravel, as do those of Harry's buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his lover Marion (Jennifer Connelly). Their excursion into the progressive circles of hell is recorded by Aronofsky with such precision that the whole film is unsettlingly like a gruesome yet compelling vivisectional experiment. </p> <p>Burstyn gives a superb performance as Sara, a sweet old lady deeply concerned for her boy: similar in many ways to her appearance in James Gray's The Yards. Living a life of genteel poverty in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, she lives for nothing more than an appalling gameshow-cum-QVC-infomercial hosted by the oily Tappy Tibbons (Christopher McDonald, who since Quiz Show has cornered the market in this sort of role). Sara gets madly over-excited when informed that she has been \"pre-approved\" for contestantship and starts manically dieting to fit into her decent red dress. As in Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, the TV game show is a vivid exemplar of a certain type of cultural squalor, and also a ghastly parody of \"family\". </p> <p>At the same time, Harry and Tyrone have big dreams of cutting some sweet deals, making it big, getting rich quick, getting out of the drug business and taking up their new residence on Easy Street. With quickly chopped sequences, Aronofsky shows the drill of getting high: the snorting, the shooting, the eye-dilation, and with extended, almost Koyaanisqatsi-type time-lapse photography he shows Sara's frenetic excitement about her upcoming TV stardom. </p> <p>Some early successes in the drug trade mean that Harry can underwrite Marion's attempts to become a fashion designer. But it all ends horribly: Harry's arm gets horrifically infected injecting his own wares and Marion ends up putting out at sex parties to feed her habit, all thoughts of designing dispersed to the four winds. In the slipstream of their headlong rush to the abyss, Mrs Goldfarb goes ga-ga with her speedy diet pills, and ends up as a bag lady in hospital getting ECT while fully conscious. (A little excessive, this: ECT is given to patients only under heavy anaesthetic.) </p> <p>So where did it all go wrong? Was this calamity inevitable or not? And what exactly is the \"dream\" for which this is a requiem, and what is the implied parable of disillusion? Here the film is enigmatic, and it is difficult to locate the morality and meaning to which Requiem for a Dream appears to be gesturing. </p> <p>It could be that Selby's 1978 novel comes from a time which pre-dates modern cinema's more complex view of drugs: a straightforward message to the effect that drugs are always wicked and always lead to hell was easier to carry off. To that extent, Requiem for a Dream is, arguably, serviceable Just Say No propaganda suitable for showing in schools. </p> <p>But how does that explain Sara Goldfarb's terrible decline? She has not dabbled in the evil drug trade; she doesn't deserve it, surely? Sara is just a lonely, vulnerable person, a decent person who only wanted to go on a TV show. And yet Aronofsky, with relentless, almost aesthetic cruelty, shows her fate as exactly equivalent to her son's. </p> <p>Evil and horror are not explained; they are just placed before us with sphinx-like calm. Somehow, a spore or germ of evil has entered their universe, and fatally infected everything and everyone, like the needle in Harry's arm. Finally, the one moment of ordinary, wholesome human compassion comes when Sara's neighbour Ada (Louise Lasser) comes to visit her in hospital and sobs outside afterwards, helplessly, with another neighbour. Everything else is ennui and torpor. </p> <p>With spareness and unremitting cruelty, Aronofsky shows his characters' accelerated slide to destruction. It's an almost unbearably bleak view and its lack of any obvious redemptive moral message will revolt some. </p> <p>But without it, Aronofsky's film is chilling, and diamond-hard.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Beleaguered Philippine president Joseph Estrada has been given until 10pm GMT tonight (6am Saturday, Philippine time) to stand down by his political opponents. Senator Raul Roco, speaking on behalf on the opposition, made the announcement. If Estrada refuses, protesters conducting an overnight vigil in the Manila streets would march on the Malacanang presidential palace, he said. Estrada's earlier offer of a May presidential election, in which he would not run, was rejected by vice-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who is constitutionally in line to succeed Estrada. The president then demanded five days' hiatus and a full pardon before he would relent, according to opposition spokesman Roberto Pagdanganan. Military commanders and cabinet ministers withdrew their support from the president this morning and joined the tens of thousands of anti-Estrada protesters. Military chief General Angelo Reyes and defence secretary Orlando Mercado joined the 150,000 massing at a Manila monument to the 1986 revolt against dictator Ferninand Marcos, to call for an end to the political turmoil caused by Estrada's impeachment on corruption charges. Reyes told demonstrators that Estrada and his family should be allowed to \"exit with dignity\". \"Let us not be vindictive, let us not be persecutive in mood,\" he said. Mercado also appeared at the gathering and hours earlier, had urged Philippine soldiers to stay out of the fray. \"Let's begin the healing process, because our country has been so deeply divided,\" said vice-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, in line to succeed Estrada. Estrada was furthered rocked by other government defections, including those of his finance secretary and the national treasurer. Education minister Andrew Gonzales, another dissenter, told reporters: \"It's over... the continuation of the present administration is no longer viable.\" National police chief and formerly staunch ally General Panfilo Lacson also withdrew his support. \"I told him I am very sorry but I have talked with senior officers and we arrived at a unanimous decision,\" he said. The president's foremost ally in the senate, Francico Tatad, agreed it was time for the leader to \"do the honourable thing\" and end the nation's \"crisis of epic proportions\". Earlier in the day, Estrada aides frantically denied that the former movie star had already fled the country. A US embassy spokesman also claimed he was unaware of any talks between Washington and Manila about possible asylum for the president in the event of his exile. Private Manila radio station dzMM had earlier reported planes were waiting to fly the Estrada family out to Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia, en route to the United States The address was broadcast just before news of the defections. Estrada maintained, \"My conscience is clear\" and urged lawmakers restart his impeachment, saying he was willing to let prosecutors open bank records that had been previously blocked. The president has been accused of profiting from an illegal numbers game and skimming provincial tobacco taxes. The scandal also drew attention to mansions he allegedly bought for some of his acknowledged mistresses. Feeling in the Philippine military is predominately against Estrada. 60 members of the Philippine Military Academy class of 1962 urged his departure in a newspaper advertisement, saying that the country's soldiers \"know what to do during the critical days ahead as they have done in the past for the good of their country and their people.\" But Estrada retains considerable support among impoverished Filipinos, whose cause he has championed.

      "body": "<p>The Spanish soloist La Ribot has presented most of her shows on conventional stages but for her current project, Still Distinguished, she has transferred to gallery spaces. The move brings with it a different way of looking, a different relationship with her audience, and it makes much better sense of her material. In the theatre, I saw the witty but narcissistic contrivances of a dancer who was very good at taking off her clothes. What I saw in the South London Gallery was an artist using her naked body to project a range of deft visual conceits, and to pack a concentrated lesson in how we look at bodies, at women and at other people. </p> <p>Not that La Ribot is denying her dance background. Few women without serious training could be so pragmatic about stripping naked so close to a bunch of strangers. And the curiously ageless La Ribot, with her slightly worn face and girlish slenderness, has the kind of body that doesn't blush under the most fascistic or voyeuristic gaze. </p> <p>The first piece, Pa amb tomaquet, is a video depicting a bizarre rite of preparation. La Ribot crumbles up a garlic clove and scrubs it vigorously over her body. She then smears on ripe tomatoes, and finally gives herself a thorough drizzling of olive oil. It's a fusion of cookery, ablution and erotic foreplay which becomes a joke about women getting ready for consumption, but it also primes us for the see-sawing relationship we develop with La Ribot during her live show, a relationship both intimate and neutral. </p> <p>When she takes off her clothes during the next piece, she lays them out on the floor, along with several assorted objects, in precise order of size. The mix of striptease and task is perfectly judged - La Ribot allows us to stare at her breasts, genitals and skin, but her efficient activity flatly defuses any sexual charge. </p> <p>Frequently, she allows herself to look vulnerable, even grotesque. In Outsized Baggage she ties herself tightly with cord - a female parcel packed for air freight - and the rope makes her flesh redden and bulge. Later she binds her joints with wooden splints to become a stiff parody of a ballerina. Yet her fine concentration allows her to retain magisterial control of her effects, and of us. </p> <p>We follow her obediently around the gallery and respond with almost childlike promptness to her cues - grinning as she smiles at us, feeling collective emotions of shock, scepticism, interest.In her final piece, having drunk a litre of water, La Ribot wraps herself in foil and lies on the floor. We all, simultaneously, wonder if she's going to pee. By the time we realise she isn't, we're all thinking that it wouldn't be such a big deal if she did. </p> <p>La Ribot's use of herself as prime material and the potentially confrontational nature of her approach suggest easy comparisms with Tracey Emin. Actually, the discipline she brings to her performance and the meticulousness with which she thinks through her ideas leave Emin floundering. </p> <p>Until Sunday. Box office: 0870 840 1961.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Spanish soloist La Ribot has presented most of her shows on conventional stages but for her current project, Still Distinguished, she has transferred to gallery spaces. The move brings with it a different way of looking, a different relationship with her audience, and it makes much better sense of her material. In the theatre, I saw the witty but narcissistic contrivances of a dancer who was very good at taking off her clothes. What I saw in the South London Gallery was an artist using her naked body to project a range of deft visual conceits, and to pack a concentrated lesson in how we look at bodies, at women and at other people. Not that La Ribot is denying her dance background. Few women without serious training could be so pragmatic about stripping naked so close to a bunch of strangers. And the curiously ageless La Ribot, with her slightly worn face and girlish slenderness, has the kind of body that doesn't blush under the most fascistic or voyeuristic gaze. The first piece, Pa amb tomaquet, is a video depicting a bizarre rite of preparation. La Ribot crumbles up a garlic clove and scrubs it vigorously over her body. She then smears on ripe tomatoes, and finally gives herself a thorough drizzling of olive oil. It's a fusion of cookery, ablution and erotic foreplay which becomes a joke about women getting ready for consumption, but it also primes us for the see-sawing relationship we develop with La Ribot during her live show, a relationship both intimate and neutral. When she takes off her clothes during the next piece, she lays them out on the floor, along with several assorted objects, in precise order of size. The mix of striptease and task is perfectly judged - La Ribot allows us to stare at her breasts, genitals and skin, but her efficient activity flatly defuses any sexual charge. Frequently, she allows herself to look vulnerable, even grotesque. In Outsized Baggage she ties herself tightly with cord - a female parcel packed for air freight - and the rope makes her flesh redden and bulge. Later she binds her joints with wooden splints to become a stiff parody of a ballerina. Yet her fine concentration allows her to retain magisterial control of her effects, and of us. We follow her obediently around the gallery and respond with almost childlike promptness to her cues - grinning as she smiles at us, feeling collective emotions of shock, scepticism, interest.In her final piece, having drunk a litre of water, La Ribot wraps herself in foil and lies on the floor. We all, simultaneously, wonder if she's going to pee. By the time we realise she isn't, we're all thinking that it wouldn't be such a big deal if she did. La Ribot's use of herself as prime material and the potentially confrontational nature of her approach suggest easy comparisms with Tracey Emin. Actually, the discipline she brings to her performance and the meticulousness with which she thinks through her ideas leave Emin floundering. Until Sunday. Box office: 0870 840 1961.",

After three quarters of a century, perhaps its general absence tells us there is something irreducibly problematic about it. The admirable performances being given at the New York Metropolitan Opera under Philippe Auguin, the first in the company's long history, fail to provide a definitive answer. In Peter Mussbach's production, Doktor Faust emerges as an intellectually impressive and often fascinating work, which mounts towards a kind of grim greatness. Yet it is also a long and elusive evening, in which Busoni's dogged adherence to his own rigorous, aesthetic principles outlasts his sense of theatre. Throughout the 10 years he worked on his opera - it was still unfinished when he died in 1924 - Busoni was determined to strip away the sentimentalities of the Faust legend and create an alternative to the mysticism invested in it by European artists, from Goethe to Mahler. Busoni's Faust returns to the unromanticised German puppet-show character of the pre-Goethe era. It is closer to Marlowe than Mahler. Crucially, there is no place for Gretchen/Marguerite, or for the metaphysics of eternal womanhood that resolve Goethe's final version. The result is an opera that is deliberately episodic. It has a beginning, of sorts, and it certainly has an end (two, in fact), but what comes in between is discontinuous and far from conventionally depicted. Musically, Busoni is determined to avoid mere entertainment. He resists many of the temptations of tonal progression and operatic tradition, though his writing is never other than harmonically grounded. It is also extremely colourful, though his palette is more Sibelius than Ravel. And it is inescapably dark-toned, since Faust is sung by a baritone and there is no major female role in the opera. The problem with Busoni's opera could almost be called Faustian. Intellectually and aesthetically, it is hugely stimulating. It demands and provides a degree of serious engagement that few other operas can rival. On the other hand, theatrically and structurally, it is almost deliberately unsatisfying as a result of Busoni's refusal to compromise his principles. The production takes him on his own terms, which has inevitable consequences. The characters are striking but cryptic, and often detached, like human puppets. The chorus is masked, ghostly and ominous, dressed like a harlequinade. The lighting, by Konrad Lindenberg, is especially fine. Only Faust, unstintingly and imposingly sung by Thomas Hampson, is required to relate to the audience. The audience's involvement therefore reciprocates. It seemed somewhat distant, primarily intellectual rather than emotional. A lot of people left at the interval. In the end, the judgment on Doktor Faust is as paradoxical as the work. It will never establish itself in the core repertoire, yet will never be forgotten. It stands as a triumphant failure, compelling and yet alienating, neither an end of an old era nor the start of a new one.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Italian Bruno Canino is best known as an interpreter of contemporary music, particularly in duet with his fellow pianist Antonio Ballista. In a pair of concerts at the Wigmore Hall this week Canino and some of his close colleagues, including Ballista, are providing a potted history of Italian music since the turn of the 20th century, from Busoni right up to a brand new work by a composer still in his 20s. It's a useful reminder of those figures who were active between the two world wars, after Puccini and before the avant-garde generation of Berio and Nono. The names may be familiar, but not much of their music. </p> <p>The trouble is that it is hard to warm to much of this music, sometimes for extra-musical reasons (Alfred Casella, for instance, was an unabashed fascist) but more often because the style - parched neoclassicism or strangulated romanticism - is congenitally uninteresting. For all Canino's energy, Casella's two-piano Ricercari on the name of Bach from 1932 never seemed to get to the point, while the combined musicianship of Ballista, the violinist Gabriele Pieranunzi and cellist Giovanni Sollima couldn't make Giorgio Ghedini's Seven Ricercari for piano trio (1943) anything but terminally dull. </p> <p>A pair of vocal works, with the excellent soprano Alda Caiello, were more engaging. Dallapiccola's 1948 songs on poems by Antonio Machado are a bejewelled set of miniatures, without a wasted note, while Malipiero's Dialogo No 3, for soprano and two pianos from 1956 was a real discovery - settings of a pair of medieval devotional poems that are uncomplicatedly direct in their lyricism and full of harmonic subtlety and delicate colours. </p> <p>Then it was back to 1922, for Busoni's massive Fantasia Contrappuntistica, which was designed as a two-piano completion of Bach's Art of Fugue.

      "bodyText": "The Italian Bruno Canino is best known as an interpreter of contemporary music, particularly in duet with his fellow pianist Antonio Ballista. In a pair of concerts at the Wigmore Hall this week Canino and some of his close colleagues, including Ballista, are providing a potted history of Italian music since the turn of the 20th century, from Busoni right up to a brand new work by a composer still in his 20s. It's a useful reminder of those figures who were active between the two world wars, after Puccini and before the avant-garde generation of Berio and Nono. The names may be familiar, but not much of their music. The trouble is that it is hard to warm to much of this music, sometimes for extra-musical reasons (Alfred Casella, for instance, was an unabashed fascist) but more often because the style - parched neoclassicism or strangulated romanticism - is congenitally uninteresting. For all Canino's energy, Casella's two-piano Ricercari on the name of Bach from 1932 never seemed to get to the point, while the combined musicianship of Ballista, the violinist Gabriele Pieranunzi and cellist Giovanni Sollima couldn't make Giorgio Ghedini's Seven Ricercari for piano trio (1943) anything but terminally dull. A pair of vocal works, with the excellent soprano Alda Caiello, were more engaging. Dallapiccola's 1948 songs on poems by Antonio Machado are a bejewelled set of miniatures, without a wasted note, while Malipiero's Dialogo No 3, for soprano and two pianos from 1956 was a real discovery - settings of a pair of medieval devotional poems that are uncomplicatedly direct in their lyricism and full of harmonic subtlety and delicate colours. Then it was back to 1922, for Busoni's massive Fantasia Contrappuntistica, which was designed as a two-piano completion of Bach's Art of Fugue. Canino and Ballista showed that they have lost none of their almost telepathic understanding, or any of the verve that has always typified their performances, but trying to weld this rambling, 40-minute monster into a coherent and lucid musical argument proved beyond even their powers of persuasion. Further concert in the Wigmore Hall tonight. Box office: 020-7935 2141.",

He said it the same way, in the same place, and after the same song last year. Donaldson, a good-humoured 75-year-old alto saxophonist from Carolina, stopped trying to reinvent himself around 1967, when he had his biggest hit with the soul-jazz anthem Alligator Boogaloo. It hardly matters. The show still works. </p> <p>As last year, Donaldson is accompanied by his Dr Lonnie Smith, a Methuselah-bearded, turban-topped Hammond organ player, and it's still Smith's stagey juggling with the dynamics and shrewd pacing of the organ's firepower that dominates. On Wednesday Donaldson restricted himself to perfunctory summaries of the catchy, stripped-down riffs of his hit tunes, and occasional bursts of the sharp-toned double-time bop runs that tip a hat to Charlie Parker. But, as a group performance, it was a much more varied and animated affair than a year ago. Even Donaldson's, seen- it-all physiognomy registered satisfaction with his young audience's obvious affection. </p> <p>Grant Green-like guitarists are essential to the 1960s organ/sax band sound and, in Randy Johnston, Donaldson had an excellent one, succinct and percussive on the chord-playing and fleet and light on the solos. Meanwhile, Donaldson sang as much as he played, sounding like Jools Holland with laryngitis. </p> <p>Smith displayed some sly stagecraft on the ensemble's staple fare, the mid-tempo funk groove. He likes a murmuring, bass-heavy tone while building up a solo, as well as much repetition of a few churchy sounds. Recycling figures and trills emphase that all-important jazz-funk landmark, the big, don't-miss-it chord-change. These overtures make even a noisy audience crane to listen, and when Smith finally bursts out of the shadows into the scorching daylight of a flat-out Hammond blast, theimpact of the pyrotechnics is redoubled. </p> <p>He demonstrated considerable uptempo virtuosity as the set progressed, and confirmed his walking-bass prowess on the pedals in a special request for the gospelly Reverend Moses. An increasingly effervescent Donaldson threw When the Saints Go Marching In into that, and Flight of the Bumble Bee (a favourite Donaldson quote) into Turtle Walk. That, by the way, is a new release, and it's a piece of... well, I'll be damned... mid-tempo jazz-funk. Hallelujah.</p>",
