Type the word \"jobs\" into a search engine and you'll be rewarded with a world wide web worth of sites, each claiming to have details of the job you really really want. The statistics on jobs online are certainly more enticing than those offered in a few pages of grubby newsprint: 6,427 jobs on <a href=\"http://www.cityjobs.com\">cityjobs.com</a>, rising to 22,292 on <a href=\"http://www.totaljobs.com\">totaljobs.com</a> and an impressive 74,898 advertised on <a href=\"http://www.gisajob.com\">gisajob.com</a>. The position of your dreams must be in there somewhere. </p> <p>If only it were that easy. Looking on \"the internet\" means, in effect, searching through countless sites, all with different criteria for listing vacancies, and with varying quality of information. For a start, you are only looking for one job, but have to find it among many thousands that you would never consider. With such an enormous volume of data, it makes sense to assume that many positions posted on these sites are duplicated elsewhere online, so the thousands of possible new opportunities might in the end come down to a handful. </p> <p>Even if you have managed to narrow your search to a few positions that interest you, there can still be problems. Katie Portwin is the co-editor of <a href=\"http://www.jobberwacky.co.uk\">Jobberwacky.co.uk</a>, a new independent online guide to job hunting on the internet. She has found that different sites expect varying levels of commitment from the applicant. \"Some request your CV as a Word document, which is easy enough,\" she says. \"But others want you to fill in exhausting forms with so many mandatory fields that you give up before you get through them. You have to be very sure of what you're looking for.\" </p> <p>Victoria Lubbock, managing director of online recruitment consultancy <a href=\"http://www.recruitmedia.co.uk\">recruitmedia.co.uk</a>, agrees. \"Job hunters need to define exactly what information they want and what information they are prepared to leave about themselves.\" It is wise to seek reassurance about how widely your details will be circulated - post your CV on a site that doesn't require you to approve all the companies that it's sent out to, and your details could end up on the laptop of your current employer. With estimates suggesting that more than 100m CVs will be circulating on the internet in the next 10 years, keeping track of who has your personal details could become impossible. </p> <p>IT positions are still the most likely to be advertised online, but the boom in job sites has sparked a scramble to attract jobseekers in all fields. As recently as last year, the number of visitors to UK job sites was too low for web auditors MMXI Europe to register. By January 2000, enough people were using the sites for it to be officially labelled \"a trend\", with more than 1% of the internet population clicking on to the much-trailed site monster.com. Within a month, the figures doubled. <a href=\"http://www.stepstone.co.uk\">Stepstone.co.uk</a> came top, with 265,000 unique visitors (site users are counted only once, no matter how many times they visit - Stepstone claims 1.9m hits per month). As the number of users increases, sites need more jobs to keep them coming. </p> <p>And secretaries and support staff have become prime targets. Most secretaries now have internet access in the office and are frequent readers of online job ads. But recruitment agencies claim that they can find good candidates without advertising beyond the agency's own website, leaving other online employment services with few jobs to splash on their own sites. As a result, these agency jobs can often pop up unauthorised on unofficial sites to beef up their secretarial sections. </p> <p>It may seem a confusing process, but there are a few simple pointers to guide you through the soup of job data online. Established recruitment agencies are the obvious place to start: most now have an online arm that allows job hunters to pluck details of positions that meet their criteria. Some may require candidates to register for job searches, and most will have an element of face-to-face (or phone-to-phone) conversation. Recruitmedia post extensive client information online so that applicants can start the process knowing something about their potential bosses; the agency also interviews all candidates before recommending them to employers. \"There's no piece of software that can determine culture, style and personality fit,\" says Lubbock. </p> <p>But not all online job sites exercise such controls, as established agencies hasten to point out. Jane Littlefield, manager of the secretarial division at recruitment consultancy Joslin Rowe, is concerned at the proliferation of websites that promise to pair CVs to job ads. She argues that these sites are often under pressure from advertisers to generate as much internet traffic through the site as possible - and that means having as many jobs as possible, from whatever source. Jobs advertised on official sites can be copied on to less scrupulous web addresses. \"The more well-known sites are displaying jobs that they are authorised to display,\" she says. \"But many of the others can't fill their sites without taking jobs from elsewhere. And they're not committed to monitoring or policing those ads in the way we do.\" </p> <p>It may annoy agencies, but isn't it providing a service for users? Littlefield concedes that job searchers might find it useful, but warns that these sites are often slow to update their information. \"The internet is now the best database in the world,\" she says, \"but when candidates ring us about positions they have seen advertised elsewhere, and the job became inactive months ago, it reflects badly on us. They want to know why we are still advertising it, and we have to admit that we didn't know anything about it.\" </p> <p>\"The billboard lists of jobs don't have consultants behind them,\" agrees Lubbock. \"There's too much choice. If you want to be represented, you need to go to a recruitment agency, and a reputable one at that.\" </p> <p>Agencies have been on the defensive since a stinging DTI report last year branded many of them cowboys. Much has been done since to clean up the industry, but some fear that the explosion in online job sites could see them forced once again to defend their reputation. Tim Richardson, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Federation, the professional standards body for the industry, welcomes the newcomers, but thinks guidelines will be needed. \"The government does need to keep an eye on this, and it will require co-ordination between the different companies to find out what the codes of practice should be. The online sites are changing our industry, and some people are concerned by the fact that it's still a new thing. But it's the good sites that will survive.\" </p> <p>Some believe that regulation is the only answer, although, as always, the problem of policing the internet is the major hurdle. \"Sites should have to contact companies to ask if they can use their job ads online,\" says Littlefield. \"At the moment, anyone can set up a job site, and while they can, they will.\" But Victoria Lubbock has doubts. \"There are sharks out there, as with all industries. But this happens everywhere. You can't control what appears online.\"</p>",

You have to be very sure of what you're looking for.\" Victoria Lubbock, managing director of online recruitment consultancy recruitmedia.co.uk, agrees. \"Job hunters need to define exactly what information they want and what information they are prepared to leave about themselves.\" It is wise to seek reassurance about how widely your details will be circulated - post your CV on a site that doesn't require you to approve all the companies that it's sent out to, and your details could end up on the laptop of your current employer. With estimates suggesting that more than 100m CVs will be circulating on the internet in the next 10 years, keeping track of who has your personal details could become impossible. IT positions are still the most likely to be advertised online, but the boom in job sites has sparked a scramble to attract jobseekers in all fields. As recently as last year, the number of visitors to UK job sites was too low for web auditors MMXI Europe to register. By January 2000, enough people were using the sites for it to be officially labelled \"a trend\", with more than 1% of the internet population clicking on to the much-trailed site monster.com. Within a month, the figures doubled. Stepstone.co.uk came top, with 265,000 unique visitors (site users are counted only once, no matter how many times they visit - Stepstone claims 1.9m hits per month). As the number of users increases, sites need more jobs to keep them coming. And secretaries and support staff have become prime targets. Most secretaries now have internet access in the office and are frequent readers of online job ads. But recruitment agencies claim that they can find good candidates without advertising beyond the agency's own website, leaving other online employment services with few jobs to splash on their own sites. As a result, these agency jobs can often pop up unauthorised on unofficial sites to beef up their secretarial sections. It may seem a confusing process, but there are a few simple pointers to guide you through the soup of job data online. Established recruitment agencies are the obvious place to start: most now have an online arm that allows job hunters to pluck details of positions that meet their criteria. Some may require candidates to register for job searches, and most will have an element of face-to-face (or phone-to-phone) conversation. Recruitmedia post extensive client information online so that applicants can start the process knowing something about their potential bosses; the agency also interviews all candidates before recommending them to employers. \"There's no piece of software that can determine culture, style and personality fit,\" says Lubbock. But not all online job sites exercise such controls, as established agencies hasten to point out. Jane Littlefield, manager of the secretarial division at recruitment consultancy Joslin Rowe, is concerned at the proliferation of websites that promise to pair CVs to job ads. She argues that these sites are often under pressure from advertisers to generate as much internet traffic through the site as possible - and that means having as many jobs as possible, from whatever source. Jobs advertised on official sites can be copied on to less scrupulous web addresses. \"The more well-known sites are displaying jobs that they are authorised to display,\" she says. \"But many of the others can't fill their sites without taking jobs from elsewhere. And they're not committed to monitoring or policing those ads in the way we do.\" It may annoy agencies, but isn't it providing a service for users? Littlefield concedes that job searchers might find it useful, but warns that these sites are often slow to update their information. \"The internet is now the best database in the world,\" she says, \"but when candidates ring us about positions they have seen advertised elsewhere, and the job became inactive months ago, it reflects badly on us. They want to know why we are still advertising it, and we have to admit that we didn't know anything about it.\" \"The billboard lists of jobs don't have consultants behind them,\" agrees Lubbock. \"There's too much choice. If you want to be represented, you need to go to a recruitment agency, and a reputable one at that.\" Agencies have been on the defensive since a stinging DTI report last year branded many of them cowboys. Much has been done since to clean up the industry, but some fear that the explosion in online job sites could see them forced once again to defend their reputation. Tim Richardson, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Federation, the professional standards body for the industry, welcomes the newcomers, but thinks guidelines will be needed. \"The government does need to keep an eye on this, and it will require co-ordination between the different companies to find out what the codes of practice should be. The online sites are changing our industry, and some people are concerned by the fact that it's still a new thing. But it's the good sites that will survive.\" Some believe that regulation is the only answer, although, as always, the problem of policing the internet is the major hurdle. \"Sites should have to contact companies to ask if they can use their job ads online,\" says Littlefield. \"At the moment, anyone can set up a job site, and while they can, they will.\" But Victoria Lubbock has doubts. \"There are sharks out there, as with all industries. But this happens everywhere. You can't control what appears online.\"",

Sam Hammam, the flamboyant owner who recently relinquished control, still tells me I am one of 'the family' because I negotiated the purchase of the freehold of their Plough Lane ground for \u00a3100,000 many years ago. </p> <p>But the whole Crazy Gang thing goes back before then, before Vinnie Jones or the rest were there. </p> <p>The original guy who started it was Allen Batsford, who took them into the Football League in 1977. He'd been a very successful manager in non-league football, first with Walton and Hersham and then Wimbledon. He brought in top non-League players such as Roger Connell, Dickie Guy and Dave Bassett as captain. </p> <p>Bassett has mellowed now, but he had one of the worst disciplinary records in non-League football and was a real hard man. So was Batsford, who could be terrifying. I remember one occasion, when as a young coach, he asked me to take the first team one day when he had flu. </p> <p>I had just passed my coaching exams and was full of great ideas, and I showed the players some old cine films of Pele and Brazil playing the beautiful game. Unfortunately we lost the next day, our first defeat in 14 games, and Batsford was furious. He stormed into the dressing room, flung the films away, with celluloid everywhere, and let me know in no uncertain terms that I had fouled up. </p> <p>I had such a panic after the incident that I inadvertently left the ground with his keys. I only realised this when I got home, but didn't have the nerve to own up to it so I buried them in the garden. </p> <p>It was only about 15 years later, when Crystal Palace got to the FA Cup final and he came to Wembley as my guest, that I felt able to admit what I had done. </p> <p>But that is how tough he was - you expected to have your legs cut off if you fouled up. He even got angry with Mike Batt from the Wombles pop group because Batsford thought it was disrespectful for the club to be linked with Uncle Bulgaria and the rest! </p> <p>But that is where the true spirit of Wimbledon came from and Bassett took it on when he took over as manager, following a short spell from Dario Gradi. Dario was a very good coach and successful manager but was not perceived to have the right personality by Ron Noades, who was chairman at the time. </p> <p>Even then, Noades had a way of alienating many of the players but I always felt that helped to build team spirit, which has been based on a them-and-us situation. I had left to manage Dulwich Hamlet but I went back to Wimbledon for a year under Bassett, and I have to say it was the most remarkable year of my life. </p> <p>There was a unique spirit about the place, with people like Wally Downes who invented the Crazy Gang nickname, and some of the antics were incredible - certainly not the sort of thing you could relate in a respectable newspaper. </p> <p>By this time Sam Hammam had bought out Noades, who took over at Palace and offered me a job as youth team manager. Bassett took it as a personal slight and didn't really speak to me for the next five years, which shows how bitter he could be if anyone left his 'gang'. </p> <p>Incidentally, we get on fine now, and he has mellowed considerably from those days. Bassett was a real grafter and worked very hard. With Dave you couldn't get away with anything. That is what kept the hardness and hunger about the team, and continued when people like Don Howe, Ray Harford and Joe Kinnear were in charge. </p> <p>Kinnear was the ideal man for Wimbledon because he had that great attitude where he really didn't care what anyone thought - he was his own man. He was made for that job and is still underestimated for what he did at Wimbledon. </p> <p>When he had his heart attack last March, the wheels started to come off. From being a top six side on the verge of Wembley, Wimbledon hardly won a game for the rest of the season. </p> <p>The idea of bringing in someone from abroad as manager was never going to work. I've met Egil Olsen several times, and used to go out to Norway to see him when he was national manager. </p> <p>I like him as a person and respect his record at international level. He was also a very good player, probably one of the best in the history of Norwegian football, but I don't think he can grasp the mentality at Wimbledon Football Club with his background. </p> <p>A lot of people in the game think he is simply the wrong man for the job. He said recently that he could not understand the emphasis here on team spirit and commitment. That shows how much he has failed to grasp what makes Wimbledon tick. </p> <p>In any team, if that bond between manager and the players is taken away it will never work. It's becoming clear now that some of the current group of players want to move on. The most important players in Wimbledon's past - Dave Beasant, Wally Downes, Vinny Jones and Dickie Guy - all believed that being part of the Crazy Gang was something special. The same goes for people like Noades and Hammam, Batsford, Bassett and Kinnear. It's not just about tactics. You need a special bond. </p> <p>At least bringing Terry Burton as coach last week should have put back some of the old spirit. Terry and Mick Harford understand what the club is all about. </p> <p>But I fear it may be too late to save Wimbledon from finally falling off the tightrope and dropping into the First Division. </p>",

      "byline": "Oliver Kay",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For the first time in eight years of playing top-flight football, John Dreyer was given the celebrity treatment this week. Much to his surprise, he was heavily in demand at Bradford City's weekly press conference, an affair usually dominated by 'names' such as Dean Saunders and Lee Sharpe. What a difference a goal makes. </p> <p>With his 37th birthday just six weeks away, the defender is finally enjoying his Warholian quarter of an hour. He has become something of a local hero since his goal at Sunderland on Monday, his first for four years, kept alive his club's hopes of avoiding relegation ahead of today's vital match against Wimbledon. </p> <p>Dreyer's well-timed arrival at the far post at the Stadium of Light caught more than just Sunderland by surprise; never a household name, he has even raised a few eyebrows among his fellow professionals by enjoying an Indian summer in the Bradford defence this season. </p> <p>'We played against Leicester earlier in the season,' Dreyer explained. 'Beforehand I bumped into Steve Guppy, who I know from when I was at Stoke, and he was at Port Vale. He just said: \"My God. Are you still here? I thought you had retired.\" I think he was being serious. You do get forgotten very quickly if you're not playing.' </p> <p>Never mind forgotten, Dreyer has even had to contend with being treated as an unknown this week. He was intrigued to read in a newspaper that his appearance at Sunderland was 'only his third game in the top flight' when in fact he spent every year between 1985 and 1992 playing against the best forwards in the land and, more often than not, fighting against relegation. </p> <p>'I have actually played most of my career in the top division but people probably aren't aware of that fact,' he said. 'I can only assume it's because I've been at less fashionable clubs, like Oxford United and Luton Town, and also because of the timing. </p> <p>'They didn't have Match of the Day then because it was banned and there wasn't anything like as much media attention. </p> <p>'We got relegated with Luton the year the Premier League started and that's when the game really took off, with Sky and so on. Basically, because there's more public interest now than ever before, players have been elevated to greater heights.' </p> <p>The defender has more grounds than most to talk of his peers in the third person, having done time in the 'real world' and waited until the grand old age of 21 before turning professional. While his current room-mate Neville Southall - 'he's from my era' - was winning the FA Cup with Everton, Dreyer was playing for Wallingford Town in the Hellenic Division. </p> <p>Football was a mere distraction as he began a traineeship as a technical illustrator with Rover. His subsequent relocations as a footballer mean he does not know how Rover's uncertain future will affect his former colleagues, but he is not without empathy for them. </p> <p>'When you put things into that kind of perspective, we shouldn't be talking about it being tragic if a football club gets relegated,' he said. 'Put it into context and it's not the end of the world, not when you realise what other people have to deal with.' </p> <p>Dreyer, in common with all at Valley Parade, is confident that Bradford can avert the threat of relegation against Wimbledon. He has mixed memories of similarly pivotal encounters from his days with Oxford and Luton but, with the voice of experience, warned that such matches are not for the faint of heart. </p> <p>'I've been in this position on a number of occasions,' he said. 'Three times we had to win the last game of the season to stay up and did it. But there was also a game with Luton where we lost at Notts County and went down. I just hope we don't freeze on the day.' </p> <p>Having finally acquired a taste for the high life this week, Dreyer is not about to surrender it without a fight. </p>",

With his 37th birthday just six weeks away, the defender is finally enjoying his Warholian quarter of an hour. He has become something of a local hero since his goal at Sunderland on Monday, his first for four years, kept alive his club's hopes of avoiding relegation ahead of today's vital match against Wimbledon. Dreyer's well-timed arrival at the far post at the Stadium of Light caught more than just Sunderland by surprise; never a household name, he has even raised a few eyebrows among his fellow professionals by enjoying an Indian summer in the Bradford defence this season. 'We played against Leicester earlier in the season,' Dreyer explained. 'Beforehand I bumped into Steve Guppy, who I know from when I was at Stoke, and he was at Port Vale. He just said: \"My God. Are you still here? I thought you had retired.\" I think he was being serious. You do get forgotten very quickly if you're not playing.' Never mind forgotten, Dreyer has even had to contend with being treated as an unknown this week. He was intrigued to read in a newspaper that his appearance at Sunderland was 'only his third game in the top flight' when in fact he spent every year between 1985 and 1992 playing against the best forwards in the land and, more often than not, fighting against relegation. 'I have actually played most of my career in the top division but people probably aren't aware of that fact,' he said. 'I can only assume it's because I've been at less fashionable clubs, like Oxford United and Luton Town, and also because of the timing. 'They didn't have Match of the Day then because it was banned and there wasn't anything like as much media attention. 'We got relegated with Luton the year the Premier League started and that's when the game really took off, with Sky and so on. Basically, because there's more public interest now than ever before, players have been elevated to greater heights.' The defender has more grounds than most to talk of his peers in the third person, having done time in the 'real world' and waited until the grand old age of 21 before turning professional. While his current room-mate Neville Southall - 'he's from my era' - was winning the FA Cup with Everton, Dreyer was playing for Wallingford Town in the Hellenic Division. Football was a mere distraction as he began a traineeship as a technical illustrator with Rover. His subsequent relocations as a footballer mean he does not know how Rover's uncertain future will affect his former colleagues, but he is not without empathy for them. 'When you put things into that kind of perspective, we shouldn't be talking about it being tragic if a football club gets relegated,' he said. 'Put it into context and it's not the end of the world, not when you realise what other people have to deal with.' Dreyer, in common with all at Valley Parade, is confident that Bradford can avert the threat of relegation against Wimbledon. He has mixed memories of similarly pivotal encounters from his days with Oxford and Luton but, with the voice of experience, warned that such matches are not for the faint of heart. 'I've been in this position on a number of occasions,' he said. 'Three times we had to win the last game of the season to stay up and did it. But there was also a game with Luton where we lost at Notts County and went down. I just hope we don't freeze on the day.' Having finally acquired a taste for the high life this week, Dreyer is not about to surrender it without a fight.",

      "bodyText": "Charlton's opera singer, Bjorn Arvidsson, could not inspire his beloved club to celebrate lifting the First Division trophy in style as Ipswich kept alive their chances of automatic promotion. Arvidsson was flown from Germany to make it a day to remember for the local faithful, but it was not enough as Ipswich inflicted a third consecutive home defeat upon Charlton. The manager, Alan Curbishley, expressed disappointment at his side's failure, and revealed he was scared into making changes as he thought a number of people would accuse him of fielding a weakened side. Curbishley said: 'We certainly know how to spoil a party. We are very disappointed not to have won our last three home games and haven't been able to enjoy what we have done. 'The players have collected their medals, but there were no real celebrations. We didn't even have any cham pagne in the dressing room. It was a damp squib in the end and a little bit sobering. 'I wanted to make more changes to the side, but if I made too many, people would say I was fielding an under-strength side and the game didn't mean anything to us. 'I wish now I would have made a few more, because a lot of the players were on their last legs.' Ipswich's manager, George Burley, was delighted with the result but still feels Manchester City are the favourites to clinch second place. Burley said: 'Two years on the trot we have had to wait for the last game to achieve promotion. 'We will try and win our own game against Walsall and then see how City get on. If they do pick up a point, then we are still in the play-offs and there is everything still to play for. 'I think City are the favourites because they only need a point, but Blackburn is a very difficult fixture for them. 'It is all set up nicely for next weekend and we will take it from there.' Ipswich midfielder Jim Magilton was the inspiration behind his side's victory, netting the first goal from a free-kick on 24 minutes. And he then played the perfect through-ball for David Johnson to grab the second on 59 minutes. Substitute Martijn Reuser scored the third on 70 minutes, before Andy Hunt pulled a consolation goal back for Charlton on 86 minutes.",

      "byline": "Vic Marks",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>DERBYSHIRE - Michael Di Venuto (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Di Venuto, 27, an occasional one-day international, is preferred to Michael Slater, a model overseas player (good in dressing room and committee room). Di Venuto, a left-hander from Tasmania, impressed at Hove last summer. Runs at Derby could be harder to come by. </p> <p><strong>DURHAM - Simon Katich (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>They have replaced an old Aussie (David Boon) with a young one. The Riverside is a long way from the Waca - the bounce is steeper and more predictable in Perth than Chester-le-Street and it's a few degrees warmer. Katich, 24, is a dashing left-hander, highly rated at home, and an occasional left-arm spinner. </p> <p><strong>ESSEX - Stuart Law (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Another Aussie who can't make their Test side. Just one Test innings back in 1996, scored 54 not out against Sri Lanka and hasn't played again. Last season he scored 1,833 runs at 73. Now 31, so another Test cap is unlikely. </p> <p><strong>GLAMORGAN - Matthew Elliott (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Elliott excelled on the 1997 tour of England, but he's stuck on 20 Tests (average 35). Like Bill Lawry - Victorian, left-handed opener, big nose. Likes to hook and pull, which can be a bit tricky at Cardiff since the ball rarely bounces above knee height. </p> <p><strong>GLOUCESTERSHIRE - Ian Harvey (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Perhaps the least eye-catching Aussie of the lot. Modest figures at Gloucester last year, but they won both one-day finals so have stuck with him. He also bowls clever medium pace and biffs away happily. </p> <p><strong>HAMPSHIRE - Shane Warne (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Another Aussie. You may have heard of him. Bowls leg spinners and a decade ago he played club cricket in Bristol for free. Hampshire cough up more now. But the county has done us a service by enticing him. He'll be cheered - and jeered - everywhere. </p> <p><strong>KENT - Rahul Dravid (India)</strong> </p> <p>Canterbury was entranced by Aravinda de Silva, so they'll appreciated Dravid, 27, who averages 48 from 35 Tests and was the 'Cricketer of the World Cup' in 1999. Stylish and correct on-field, polite and articulate off it, Dravid may be the first Indian batsman to take the county game by storm. </p> <p><strong>LANCASHIRE - Saurav Ganguly (India)</strong> </p> <p>Ganguly, the new Indian captain, was enlisted when Muttiah Muralitharan's international commitments became too heavy. Ganguly is very talented, but Lancashire's opponents will prefer to come across him than the mighty Murali. </p> <p><strong>LEICESTERSHIRE - Anil Kumble (India)</strong> </p> <p>Only Kapil Dev has taken more Test wickets for India. We know that Kumble's brand of pacy leg-breaks will be effective in England. He played for Northants in 1995, acted as Allan Lamb's chauffeur (he doesn't drink), took 105 wickets and almost won the Championship for them. </p> <p><strong>MIDDLESEX - Justin Langer (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Middlesex apparently played better under Langer's captaincy last year than when Mark Ramprakash was not on Test duty and in charge. Langer, a left-hander, now established as Test regular after a hugely productive last 12 months, is their new captain charged with obtaining instant elevation from the second division. </p> <p><strong>NORTHAMPTONSHIRE - Matthew Hayden (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>One of seven Aussie southpaws unable to secure a regular Test place there, but much sought after here. Has so far played two seasons in county cricket - for Hampshire in 1997 and for Northamptonshire last year. In both summers he averaged over 50. </p> <p><strong>NOTTINGHAMSHIRE - Shoiab Akhtar (Pakistan)</strong> </p> <p>After Warne, the most likely to put bums on seats. At his best, a magnificent sight unless you happen to be stuck 22 yards away. Worries about his action (now deemed OK) and his fitness (still dodgy) clouded his arrival. </p> <p><strong>SOMERSET - Jamie Cox (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>He would walk into the England Test side, but at 30 it's probably too late for Australia. Orthodox opener and a calm, authoritative captain. Skippers Tasmania during our winter. </p> <p><strong>SURREY - Saqlain Mushtaq (Pakistan)</strong> </p> <p>Doesn't arrive until June - a good judge - but that may be early enough to enable Surrey to retain the Championship. Last summer took 58 wickets in seven matches , all won by Surrey. No one can decipher the mystery ball - looks like an off-break, acts like a leg-break. </p> <p><strong>SUSSEX - Michael Bevan (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Back after a one-year sabbatical. Already notched two scores over 150 in limited overs games this April. The only blot in a dazzling career is a modest Test record and the indignity of being 'found out' against the short ball by - of all teams - England. This is far less likely to occur on the county circuit. </p> <p><strong>WARWICKSHIRE - Allan Donald (South Africa)</strong> </p> <p>Picked a good time to absent himself from those one-day games in India. The senior import at 33 and devoted to Birmingham. A great club man and a great bowler. But will his body still permit him to deliver. </p> <p><strong>WORCESTERSHIRE - Glenn McGrath (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>If he avoids injury, McGrath could catapult Worcestershire into the first division. He should be ideally suited to English conditions. Cranky on the pitch, charming off it, he will fit in well. McGrath, however, will only stay for a year; the Aussies would not contemplate their strike bowler being absent for any longer. </p> <p><strong>YORKSHIRE - Darren Lehmann (Australia)</strong> </p> <p>Returns after a stunning season in Australian domestic cricket - 995 runs in nine matches for South Australia. Greg Blewett, a Test regular unlike Lehmann, could only average 31 last year for Yorkshire. The wicket in Adelaide is more trustworthy than Headingley, but still expect this resourceful left-hander to cope better than his South Australian colleague. </p>",

DURHAM - Simon Katich (Australia) They have replaced an old Aussie (David Boon) with a young one. The Riverside is a long way from the Waca - the bounce is steeper and more predictable in Perth than Chester-le-Street and it's a few degrees warmer. Katich, 24, is a dashing left-hander, highly rated at home, and an occasional left-arm spinner. ESSEX - Stuart Law (Australia) Another Aussie who can't make their Test side. Just one Test innings back in 1996, scored 54 not out against Sri Lanka and hasn't played again. Last season he scored 1,833 runs at 73. Now 31, so another Test cap is unlikely. GLAMORGAN - Matthew Elliott (Australia) Elliott excelled on the 1997 tour of England, but he's stuck on 20 Tests (average 35). Like Bill Lawry - Victorian, left-handed opener, big nose. Likes to hook and pull, which can be a bit tricky at Cardiff since the ball rarely bounces above knee height. GLOUCESTERSHIRE - Ian Harvey (Australia) Perhaps the least eye-catching Aussie of the lot. Modest figures at Gloucester last year, but they won both one-day finals so have stuck with him. He also bowls clever medium pace and biffs away happily. HAMPSHIRE - Shane Warne (Australia) Another Aussie. You may have heard of him. Bowls leg spinners and a decade ago he played club cricket in Bristol for free. Hampshire cough up more now. But the county has done us a service by enticing him. He'll be cheered - and jeered - everywhere. KENT - Rahul Dravid (India) Canterbury was entranced by Aravinda de Silva, so they'll appreciated Dravid, 27, who averages 48 from 35 Tests and was the 'Cricketer of the World Cup' in 1999. Stylish and correct on-field, polite and articulate off it, Dravid may be the first Indian batsman to take the county game by storm. LANCASHIRE - Saurav Ganguly (India) Ganguly, the new Indian captain, was enlisted when Muttiah Muralitharan's international commitments became too heavy. Ganguly is very talented, but Lancashire's opponents will prefer to come across him than the mighty Murali. LEICESTERSHIRE - Anil Kumble (India) Only Kapil Dev has taken more Test wickets for India. We know that Kumble's brand of pacy leg-breaks will be effective in England. He played for Northants in 1995, acted as Allan Lamb's chauffeur (he doesn't drink), took 105 wickets and almost won the Championship for them. MIDDLESEX - Justin Langer (Australia) Middlesex apparently played better under Langer's captaincy last year than when Mark Ramprakash was not on Test duty and in charge. Langer, a left-hander, now established as Test regular after a hugely productive last 12 months, is their new captain charged with obtaining instant elevation from the second division. NORTHAMPTONSHIRE - Matthew Hayden (Australia) One of seven Aussie southpaws unable to secure a regular Test place there, but much sought after here. Has so far played two seasons in county cricket - for Hampshire in 1997 and for Northamptonshire last year. In both summers he averaged over 50. NOTTINGHAMSHIRE - Shoiab Akhtar (Pakistan) After Warne, the most likely to put bums on seats. At his best, a magnificent sight unless you happen to be stuck 22 yards away. Worries about his action (now deemed OK) and his fitness (still dodgy) clouded his arrival. SOMERSET - Jamie Cox (Australia) He would walk into the England Test side, but at 30 it's probably too late for Australia. Orthodox opener and a calm, authoritative captain. Skippers Tasmania during our winter. SURREY - Saqlain Mushtaq (Pakistan) Doesn't arrive until June - a good judge - but that may be early enough to enable Surrey to retain the Championship. Last summer took 58 wickets in seven matches , all won by Surrey. No one can decipher the mystery ball - looks like an off-break, acts like a leg-break. SUSSEX - Michael Bevan (Australia) Back after a one-year sabbatical. Already notched two scores over 150 in limited overs games this April. The only blot in a dazzling career is a modest Test record and the indignity of being 'found out' against the short ball by - of all teams - England. This is far less likely to occur on the county circuit. WARWICKSHIRE - Allan Donald (South Africa) Picked a good time to absent himself from those one-day games in India. The senior import at 33 and devoted to Birmingham. A great club man and a great bowler. But will his body still permit him to deliver. WORCESTERSHIRE - Glenn McGrath (Australia) If he avoids injury, McGrath could catapult Worcestershire into the first division. He should be ideally suited to English conditions. Cranky on the pitch, charming off it, he will fit in well. McGrath, however, will only stay for a year; the Aussies would not contemplate their strike bowler being absent for any longer. YORKSHIRE - Darren Lehmann (Australia) Returns after a stunning season in Australian domestic cricket - 995 runs in nine matches for South Australia. Greg Blewett, a Test regular unlike Lehmann, could only average 31 last year for Yorkshire. The wicket in Adelaide is more trustworthy than Headingley, but still expect this resourceful left-hander to cope better than his South Australian colleague.",

Mirza had been earmarked to play an important part in Worcestershire's future following his emergence, alongside Paul Thomas, in bolstering an ageing attack. But Mirza's death, by natural causes at his Birmingham home, left a void that will be hard to fill.

English cricket wrapped up in a sentence or two, where it is best understood, the game's old yellow-bound bible. </p> <p>There are others who knew Parvez. </p> <p>'He was a good friend,' said Raja Khan. 'He'd had a hole in the heart when he was young, although there was nothing very untoward after that until one day he just choked, and collapsed on the floor. The ambulance couldn't get there in time and he passed away. It was right in the middle of his career at Worcester.' </p> <p>Raja decided to do something in memory of his friend. A lot of people thought he was mad. </p> <p>'I went to Worcestershire and suggested that they might be interested in taking on young inner-city players on summer contracts, paid for by the Asian business community. I said to them, \"We'll bring you some of these young cricketers and, if you think any of them are good enough, you choose and we pay.\" They were taken aback a little but they said, \"Well, we can't lose.\" So they went for it.' </p> <p>The first recipient was Abdul Hafeez. Two years ago Worcester took him on and, on his debut at New Road, he opened the batting against a useful bowler for Gloucestershire. Picking Courtney Walsh's bouncers off his nose, with the slips baying for blood, he hit two fours and a six in his first over as a professional cricketer. </p> <p>'All of a sudden,' Raja recalled last week, 'people were taking notice of someone they'd never heard of, someone who'd hit 14 off Courtney Walsh in his first over for the county.' </p> <p>It didn't quite work out for Hafeez after that. He was released after a moderate season - but the precedent had been set. This was an idea that had something about it. </p> <p>A couple of Tuesdays ago, I went with Raja to Grace Road where he had lined up another nine recruits. Leicestershire's coach, Jack Birkenshaw, not an easy man to please, was clearly impressed, not only by the talent on show but the canny business to be done. 'I can't see how we can lose,' he said. </p> <p>His assistant, Phil Robinson, ex-Yorkshire, wasn't so forthcoming. None the less, he looked pleased enough when he watched the cool elegance of a young left-hand opening bat, Imran Ahmed, at the second time of asking in the nets. </p> <p>Imran is desperate to be a county cricketer, maybe an England one too. He plays for Ilford in Essex, and Surrey have tracked his progress as well. What they see in him is the most graceful batting against pace you could ask of a player so young and untried. He has the tools. He also now has a place at Leicestershire, after the county took up Raja's offer to pay for Imran. </p> <p>Others have been placed around the counties. More will follow. Raja took his caravan to Sussex last week and county chairmen only have to pick up the phone if they want to have a look at potential players who will cost them nothing. </p> <p>After Hafeez, Worcestershire took on Kabir Ali and his cousin, Kadir Ali. Kabir took four wickets in his opening match this season. Kadir has a summer contract. </p> <p>If you're wondering what the catch is, there isn't one. What there is, though, and what is the key to the unusual scheme's success, is the name of Wasim Akram. Raja is his manager and, when he mentions the name of the Pakistani star, doors open. Some of them don't slam shut, either. </p> <p>Last season, after a World Cup he would want to forget, Wasim was persuaded to finish the season playing club cricket with Smethwick. It didn't go as well as Raja had hoped. 'I got a bit altruistic, I suppose,' he said. </p> <p>'I wanted my old club, Smethwick, to play five teams, which would have given places to a whole lot of people who hadn't access to club facilities before, but some of the old guard were wary. There's a Channel 4 documentary coming out soon about the whole politics and shenanigans of it, bringing Wasim Akram in, sponsors pulling out... I was really disillusioned. </p> <p>'It got to the stage where the club, to all intents and purposes, kicked me out. They were saying, \"Raja's trying to make it an Asian club.\" But all I ever wanted was for Asians to be able to stand on their own two feet. I never wanted an all-Asian club. Everything I stand for is Britain as a multiracial society.' </p> <p>Even Raja's Cambridge-educated suaveness cannot always melt the stubbornness and suspicion of the county game. This year, though, he will keep the players together at a new club, the Wasim Akram Academy team, playing in the Birmingham League. Wasim arrives to play with these hopefuls next month. Maybe a few will make it. </p> <p>It will make Raja very happy - Parvez, too, if he's looking down from somewhere.</p>",

They were scrummaging in Southampton to grab a sentence or a snap when he arrived. Shane has hit town, even if he's not gracing the Zimbabweans with his presence this weekend. And we should all welcome him. We could do with some cheering up and, for sure, Warne will bring a smile to our faces.</p> <p>He is already earning his keep. Membership is on the rise at Southampton and in 12 deliveries during a 10-over game against Surrey at The Oval he took 2-6 and Hampshire - or 'Hampshheeer' as Warne calls his new team - were suddenly in the quarter finals of the Benson and Hedges competition. Whether he succeeds or fails this summer, he'll always captivate. He is the biggest star to be attracted to county cricket since Gary Sobers first appeared for Nottinghamshire 32 years ago. And, as the biggest Australian star, he has good company from down under. </p> <p>Antipodeans are everywhere, it seems. Twelve Aussies altogether, including Warne, plying their trade in the newly split county championship. </p> <p>There have been some brilliant cricketers from overseas in the years since Sobers' talent lit up Tent Bridge but many of them arrived in the UK as relative unknowns. Barry and Viv Richards, Mike Procter, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall, Courtney Walsh, Joel Garner and Allan Donald were just starting illustrious careers when they made their debuts in county cricket. Warne is somewhere near the peak of his fame (whether he's still at his peak as a cricketer remains - deliciously - to be seen). The hullabaloo is justified just as it would be if Rivaldo agreed terms with Glenn Hoddle at The Dell. </p> <p>His baptism should be easier than Sobers' in 1968. That was the year overseas players were first allowed into the English game without serving a period of qualification. Sobers was the prime draw, but incomers also included Barry Richards, Procter, Faroukh Engineer, Asif Iqbal, Majid Khan and a 19-year-old Greg Chappell. They reinvigorated an ailing English game. </p> <p>At Trent Bridge Sobers joined a side that had failed to win one of their 28 Championship matches in 1967, though they drew 22 (whoever believes our current Championship is dead and dull should examine the staleness of much of the cricket in the Sixties). In 1968, with Sobers as captain, topping the batting averages as well as taking 83 wickets, Nottinghamshire won seven matches and surged up to fourth from the previous year's 16th. When they travelled for a Championship match to Derbyshire, Sobers' presence prompted record receipts of \u00a31,686 (how often do they get that much now?) </p> <p>By comparison Warne's task is much easier. Hampshire bubbled along under the cheerful leadership of Robin Smith last year. They have the odd handy wealthy backer in the background and with Warne and Alan Mullally added to their squad they should be able to bowl sides out. Whatever happens they'll attract the crowds since Warne possesses not only a big leg-break but also that indefinable something sufficient to make you toss the umbrella and hip flask into the car and head for Southampton. </p> <p>So Warne is one of a dozen Australians here this summer, all of whom are careful not to take the standard Aussie (and Atherton) line on English county cricket - that it's garbage. Such a line would undermine their presence in England.Why are they here? 1) There's a gap in the Australian international calendar. 2) This is the only place where it's possible to earn decent money - anything from \u00a350,000 to \u00a3150,000 - playing non-international cricket. 3) They like playing cricket. 4) The counties like them. </p> <p>The Australians produce and they fit in well. Despite all the blather about the antipathy between Poms and Aussies, they sit happily in the same dressing-room. I discovered this 15 years ago in West Australia; meanwhile countless Aussies have since played English county cricket and I can't recall a bad word said about any of them. A few have struggled to perform, like Michael Slater at Derby, but they liked him and his attitude nonetheless. </p> <p>There are some who quibble that the 'second grade' Aussies (those who can't make their Test side regularly - such as Di Venuto, Law, Elliott, Harvey, Katich, Cox, Hayden and Lehmann - do not enhance the English game. Look at the averages and the impact that many of these men have already had on their counties; not just their runs, but their example. When we can find a batch of Englishmen who can match their output, then their presence may not be justified - or required. </p> <p>In some ways the non-Aussie overseas players are more intriguing, partly because (with the exception of Allan Donald) they are not so familiar. We glimpsed the silky skills of Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly in the World Cup, but we'd like to see more. Saqlain's leg-break, though quite familiar, still mystifies and is it possible to play the brisk Anil Kumble as an in-swing bowler? I doubt it. </p> <p>But Warne apart it will be Shoaib Akhtar at Nottingham that excites the greatest interest of the spectator and the odd opening batsman. Here the parallel with the arrival of Sobers is closer. Nottinghamshire were dreadful last year, languishing near the foot of the table (17th) and their opening efforts in the Benson and Hedges Cup this 'summer' were woeful as well. Sobers managed a revival, but surely it's too much to expect the inexperienced Shoaib to do the same. So much depends on whether the new, though hardly fresh, recruits like Darren Bicknell and John Morris can cobble together enough runs. Now there's a topic for debate. What harms the English game more? The influx of overseas players, who are so often convenient scapegoats, or the recycling of doughty old pros who have passed their sell-by-date?</p>",

Such a line would undermine their presence in England.Why are they here? 1) There's a gap in the Australian international calendar. 2) This is the only place where it's possible to earn decent money - anything from \u00a350,000 to \u00a3150,000 - playing non-international cricket. 3) They like playing cricket. 4) The counties like them. The Australians produce and they fit in well. Despite all the blather about the antipathy between Poms and Aussies, they sit happily in the same dressing-room. I discovered this 15 years ago in West Australia; meanwhile countless Aussies have since played English county cricket and I can't recall a bad word said about any of them. A few have struggled to perform, like Michael Slater at Derby, but they liked him and his attitude nonetheless. There are some who quibble that the 'second grade' Aussies (those who can't make their Test side regularly - such as Di Venuto, Law, Elliott, Harvey, Katich, Cox, Hayden and Lehmann - do not enhance the English game. Look at the averages and the impact that many of these men have already had on their counties; not just their runs, but their example. When we can find a batch of Englishmen who can match their output, then their presence may not be justified - or required. In some ways the non-Aussie overseas players are more intriguing, partly because (with the exception of Allan Donald) they are not so familiar. We glimpsed the silky skills of Rahul Dravid and Saurav Ganguly in the World Cup, but we'd like to see more. Saqlain's leg-break, though quite familiar, still mystifies and is it possible to play the brisk Anil Kumble as an in-swing bowler? I doubt it. But Warne apart it will be Shoaib Akhtar at Nottingham that excites the greatest interest of the spectator and the odd opening batsman. Here the parallel with the arrival of Sobers is closer. Nottinghamshire were dreadful last year, languishing near the foot of the table (17th) and their opening efforts in the Benson and Hedges Cup this 'summer' were woeful as well. Sobers managed a revival, but surely it's too much to expect the inexperienced Shoaib to do the same. So much depends on whether the new, though hardly fresh, recruits like Darren Bicknell and John Morris can cobble together enough runs. Now there's a topic for debate. What harms the English game more? The influx of overseas players, who are so often convenient scapegoats, or the recycling of doughty old pros who have passed their sell-by-date?",

Over the last few weeks a lot of column inches have been written about the game but they have all tended to deal with matters off the pitch and that is not a good thing. Cricket is about what happens out in the middle and that is where I'm happiest to be. </p> <p>The winter seemed to go very quickly but that is because I packed so much in. </p> <p>When last season ended I had a holiday in Brazil and then I checked myself into Lilleshall in an effort to get as fit as I have ever been. I spent a total of 13 weeks there either side of Christmas and I loved it. </p> <p>You're very secluded up in the north Shropshire countryside, even out of mobile phone range, and that means it is easy to concentrate on the job in hand. </p> <p>John Brewer, who runs the National Sports Centre, and Matt Asquith worked out a regime for me that would improve my basic level of fitness and have me start the season in the best shape possible. I've always prided myself on the fact that I kept rumbling along and not breaking down - rather like an old Ford Escort - but it was time to up the ante. </p> <p>I don't think there is a cricketer in the country who could hold his hand up and say, 'I couldn't be any fitter', and even after the work I've put I could still get fitter still but that isn't the way to go. </p> <p>The cricket season is a marathon not a sprint. We will be playing 100 days of cricket over a 140 day stretch and so you don't want to run the risk of doing yourself any damage. It's not good for the team and doesn't do you any favours. </p> <p>When I was at Sussex I played in the same side as Paul Parker, one of the best cover fielders ever. Paul was the fittest guy I've ever seen - he had the perfect six pack - but he was very injury prone. In the course of two years when our careers over-lapped we only played in the same side about twice due to Paul being out of commission. There's no point in having a Ferrari if it spends its life in the workshop. </p> <p>I'm now as fit and strong as I've ever been and ready for the season to really get going. </p> <p>I took some time off in December to sell Christmas trees with Nadeem Shahid, the Surrey batsman, and then we headed for Australia. Seeing in the new Millennium in Sydney was quite thrill but we made a pact to get back to work by 3 January. There are worse places to work out than on the thirty-first floor of Sydney's Continental Hotel but Down Under is full of temptations. 50 lengths of the pool or 18 holes of golf is no contest so I headed back to England and checked back into Lilleshall. </p> <p>People might think that was a strange decision but I loved the routine and put in some serious graft. Hopefully the results will be borne this summer. </p> <p>Cricketers who don't play cricket in the winter do get up to some curious things. My Warwickshire team-mate Dougie Brown seems to have found himself some gainful employment in the clothing business. He's now sporting a complete new wardrobe of designer gear - all at knockdown prices. In the past, before he was a regular in the England side, Andy Caddick spent his winters being a handyman at Somerset's ground in Taunton and, stranger still, the Wells brothers, Colin and Alan have worked at Newhaven docks. Thinking of them doesn't make Lilleshall seem like such hard work. </p> <p>Pre-season training was again spent in the delights of Bloemfontein. Our new coach Bob Woolmer, or Lord Bob as he is know in South Africa, has really picked the squad up after a difficult 1999. Although for much of the time we were out there it rained, and rained unbelievably hard, Bob's influence is really starting to rub off. He is a great help to the batsmen in particular since he concentrates so hard on the mental side of the game. Batters respond to that kind of thing. </p> <p>The weather back here has insured that the new season has only dribbled into life. The rain completely ruined the group stages of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and Warwickshire are already out of that competition. I don't know why we play the early stages of a prestigious competition (it does end in a Lord's final) so early in the season when its more likely to be wet. The public love one-day cricket but they aren't going to pay to watch when they are more likely to be soaked than see any cricket. </p> <p>There is an upside to the downpours. Warwickshire are sitting out the first round of County Championship games and since there's been very little cricket played at all it is more than likely that most fixtures will end in draws. That gives us a chance to steal a march on the others if we get off to a winning start this week. </p> <p>The main aim for this season is to get out of the Second Division in both the Championship and the one-day league. With three teams being promoted in the County Championship we are good enough to go up but we are aiming to go up as champions. </p> <p>It will interesting to see how the two division system works this summer. It's certainly going to provide a lot more meaningful matches and that will mean better cricket. There's a host of top quality overseas stars playing here and there are England places up for grabs. It's going to quite a season. </p> <p>I couldn't have prepared better for the summer ahead and I intend to take every opportunity to show what I can do.</p>",

When last season ended I had a holiday in Brazil and then I checked myself into Lilleshall in an effort to get as fit as I have ever been. I spent a total of 13 weeks there either side of Christmas and I loved it. You're very secluded up in the north Shropshire countryside, even out of mobile phone range, and that means it is easy to concentrate on the job in hand. John Brewer, who runs the National Sports Centre, and Matt Asquith worked out a regime for me that would improve my basic level of fitness and have me start the season in the best shape possible. I've always prided myself on the fact that I kept rumbling along and not breaking down - rather like an old Ford Escort - but it was time to up the ante. I don't think there is a cricketer in the country who could hold his hand up and say, 'I couldn't be any fitter', and even after the work I've put I could still get fitter still but that isn't the way to go. The cricket season is a marathon not a sprint. We will be playing 100 days of cricket over a 140 day stretch and so you don't want to run the risk of doing yourself any damage. It's not good for the team and doesn't do you any favours. When I was at Sussex I played in the same side as Paul Parker, one of the best cover fielders ever. Paul was the fittest guy I've ever seen - he had the perfect six pack - but he was very injury prone. In the course of two years when our careers over-lapped we only played in the same side about twice due to Paul being out of commission. There's no point in having a Ferrari if it spends its life in the workshop. I'm now as fit and strong as I've ever been and ready for the season to really get going. I took some time off in December to sell Christmas trees with Nadeem Shahid, the Surrey batsman, and then we headed for Australia. Seeing in the new Millennium in Sydney was quite thrill but we made a pact to get back to work by 3 January. There are worse places to work out than on the thirty-first floor of Sydney's Continental Hotel but Down Under is full of temptations. 50 lengths of the pool or 18 holes of golf is no contest so I headed back to England and checked back into Lilleshall. People might think that was a strange decision but I loved the routine and put in some serious graft. Hopefully the results will be borne this summer. Cricketers who don't play cricket in the winter do get up to some curious things. My Warwickshire team-mate Dougie Brown seems to have found himself some gainful employment in the clothing business. He's now sporting a complete new wardrobe of designer gear - all at knockdown prices. In the past, before he was a regular in the England side, Andy Caddick spent his winters being a handyman at Somerset's ground in Taunton and, stranger still, the Wells brothers, Colin and Alan have worked at Newhaven docks. Thinking of them doesn't make Lilleshall seem like such hard work. Pre-season training was again spent in the delights of Bloemfontein. Our new coach Bob Woolmer, or Lord Bob as he is know in South Africa, has really picked the squad up after a difficult 1999. Although for much of the time we were out there it rained, and rained unbelievably hard, Bob's influence is really starting to rub off. He is a great help to the batsmen in particular since he concentrates so hard on the mental side of the game. Batters respond to that kind of thing. The weather back here has insured that the new season has only dribbled into life. The rain completely ruined the group stages of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and Warwickshire are already out of that competition. I don't know why we play the early stages of a prestigious competition (it does end in a Lord's final) so early in the season when its more likely to be wet. The public love one-day cricket but they aren't going to pay to watch when they are more likely to be soaked than see any cricket. There is an upside to the downpours. Warwickshire are sitting out the first round of County Championship games and since there's been very little cricket played at all it is more than likely that most fixtures will end in draws. That gives us a chance to steal a march on the others if we get off to a winning start this week. The main aim for this season is to get out of the Second Division in both the Championship and the one-day league. With three teams being promoted in the County Championship we are good enough to go up but we are aiming to go up as champions. It will interesting to see how the two division system works this summer. It's certainly going to provide a lot more meaningful matches and that will mean better cricket. There's a host of top quality overseas stars playing here and there are England places up for grabs. It's going to quite a season. I couldn't have prepared better for the summer ahead and I intend to take every opportunity to show what I can do.",

Mark Burchill, who only came into the side minutes before the kick-off after an injury Johann Mjallby in the warm-up, capitalised on a mistake by goalkeeper Stephen Woods to put Celtic ahead after 16 minutes. Celtic, inspired by Burchill, then created a number of good chances. They certainly should have gone further ahead when Mark Viduka went crashing to the ground, somewhat theatrically, under the challenge of Benito Kemble and the referee gave them a penalty, But Woods saved Viduka's kick, and even kept out a follow-up effort from the Australian. </p> <p>Celtic suffered more injury problems when Jackie McNamara was carried off in the 40th minute after an innocuous looking challenge on Don Goodman; and on the stroke of half-time, they were forced to rue their missed chances when Ged Brannan scored Motherwell's equaliser from a free-kick. </p> <p>Celtic had their chances in the second half, too. One of the worst misses came from defender Vidar Riseth, who played a neat one-two with Viduka, took the ball around Woods, but blasted it high over the bar. Then it was Viduka's turn - again - to show that players are not infallible. He was played through by Burchill, but shot wide with only Woods to beat. </p> <p>Hibernian marked their last home match before the redevelopment of their ground with a 1-0 win over Aberdeen. The scorer was Keith Miller, who - ironically - found the net when his team had the advantage of playing down that famous Easter Road slope. Hibs manager Alex McLeish said: 'I felt we passed the ball about very well today. We told them to go out and enjoy the game. Grant Brebner was excellent. He has struggled to find a performance this season but this match will do him the world of good as he tries to find consistency for next season.' </p> <p>Aberdeen boss Ebbe Skovdahl felt his side were unlucky but agreed that they they looked jaded. 'They only had us under real pressure for 10 minutes of the second half but in the second half we did not create enough chances.' </p> <p>St Johnstone, also 1-0 winners, at Dundee United, owed their success to a Darren Dods header - his first goal of the season. Unusually for a Premier League match, this one flowed from end to end. But the visitors were the more impressive side. Their breakthrough came in the 67th minute when Dods came in to blast a header in from eight yards after Maurice Malpas had deflected a cross into the defender's path. </p> <p>St Mirren clinched the First Division championship with three goals in eight minutes against Raith. </p> <p>George Burley's Ipswich may have kept up the pressure for the second automatic promotion spot in the Nationwide First Division, but Burley admitted that Manchester City remain favourites to finish runners-up.

The first half was almost as good as we played against Barcelona here,' said the Chelsea manager, Gianluca Vialli, who had given his side an earful after their own surrender to a half-paced Manchester United last Monday but did not cite it as a reason for his team's improvement. </p> <p>'They were upset with themselves,' he added. 'This result was more because we had time to prepare. The quality is there and when we are rested, focussed, we are difficult to beat.' It is remarkable what a threat to a player's FA Cup final place, or the promise of one, can do, though, and what new energy it can put into ageing legs, of which they are a few pairs in this Chelsea side. </p> <p>Vialli's team selection initially looked curious; no surprise that a reportedly annoyed Didier Deschamps and Dan Petrescu were left out amid last week's debate about players' commitment to the cause, but Tore Andre Flo? With the second top scorer, Gustavo Poyet, beginning the game on the bench after returning from a match for Uruguay only on Friday, where would the goals come from, since Gianfranco Zola and Weah had only managed five in the league between them? </p> <p>This was a team with pride stung, however. Mario Melchiot struck the tone immediately by winning the ball in midfield with a forceful tackle and found Roberto Di Matteo. His through ball caught Sami Hyppia uncharacteristically out of position and Weah in space, the Liberian steering it home expertly. Just 124 seconds had elapsed. </p> <p>Soon it was two. Liverpool were again stretched, Zola pulling wide and his ball infield to Weah was ferried on to a revitalised Di Matteo who was left unmarked to side-foot home. This was more the Liverpool defence of previous seasons, porous early on and the side left chasing the game. </p> <p>They never looked likely to catch up, with Chelsea's fluency fuelled by the mobile Dennis Wise and Jody Morris in the centre of midfield, where Steven Gerrard and Dietmar Hamann were unusually submissive. It helped when Jamie Redknapp, feeling his way back to fitness, came on to replace Gerrard, victim of a groin strain, with his range of passing finally getting Michael Owen and Emile Heskey moving- but still there was little doing for them, Marcel Desailly dominant. </p> <p>Mostly there were restricted to long shots, Hamann wide several times, and unconvincing penalty appeals, notably when Ed de Goey brought down Patrik Berger, the referee, Graham Barber, ruling that the Czech had fouled the goalkeeper earlier, however. It was late in the game, Houllier by then having thrown on Robbie Fowler to form a four up front, before they even went close, De Goey touching away Heskey's shot from Jon Harley's weak header back. </p> <p>Chelsea created little more after their early surge, save for Di Matteo's cross-shot tipped over by Sander Westerveld and another that he drove wide, but then they had little need to, so ineffectual were Liverpool.

Houllier cited Chelsea's experience as a factor in their superiority over his young team; Vialli pointed to his team's 61 games compared with Liverpool's 43 as a reason for his team's recent run and the opponents' surge.

Attracted by the magnet of enormous wealth coupled with the clearance to let imaginations run wild, architects worldwide have been drawn like bees to the honeypot.

This high-tech flow of glass, concrete and steel throughout Dubai, serves to mirror the moneyed international mix of largely non-national residents here to make their fortunes and tourists eager to spend theirs. </p> <p> Pickings for culture vultures may not be plentiful in a city so firmly focused on the future but first-time visitors should not bypass the Dubai Museum. Housed in the restored Al-Fahidi Fort dating back to 1799, on the Bur Dubai side of the Creek, the mix of hands-on exhibits, static displays and hologram films presents an easily digested insight into the history, customs and life in the desert. Not far from the museum is the Bastakia quarter containing the few remaining examples of houses that were the residences of wealthy Iranian merchants with their unique windtowers - a pre-electric method of air-conditioning. </p> <p>Board an abra, one of the water taxis that crisscross the creek, to get your bearings or just walk along the dhow wharfage to get a flavour of the cargo being unloaded from India, South Africa and South East Asia. </p> <p>The second largest of the seven Emirates has historically traded lucratively on its location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa, bringing exotic woods and spices from India and silks from China. </p> <p>But Dubai's development suffered a hiccup in the 1930s when its pearl industry plunged into decline with the development of the cultured variety by the Japanese. Gold quickly replaced pearls as the precious commodity for trade when the enterprising Sheikh Rashid (Dubai's ruler at the time) sought other resources. Stroll along Deira's Sikkat Al Khail Street, the main artery of its renowned Gold Souk and be dazzled by window display upon window display of the metal in every shade and description, from intricate works of art to plain ingots. Here all that glitters with the lustre of gold will be genuine - stringent laws operate to vouchsafe authenticity. </p> <p>If you're not content with just window-shopping be prepared to play the game of bartering as part of the shopping experience and don't be surprised when scales are produced - gold is normally sold according to weight - design is usually immaterial. </p> <p>For light retail relief away from the malls, head for cooler climes of Hatta village, a favourite retreat in the Hajar Mountains with the urban crowd. Tours offer plenty of scope to go dune riding in a 4WD, explore the wadis (dried riverbeds) and rockpool oases and even try sandskiing. </p> <p>Having shopped until you drop during your stay and checked in more luggage than you recall bringing with you, Dubai airport's duty free shops will still beckon. </p> <p> Marjorie Yue travelled with BA Holidays 0870 24 24 245; <a href=\"http://www.baholidays.co.uk\">www.baholidays.co.uk</a> which features five nights b&amp;b at the Royal Mirage starting at \u00a3745 including return scheduled flights from Heathrow (free flight connection to Heathrow available from selected regional airports) and transfers.</p>",

Pickings for culture vultures may not be plentiful in a city so firmly focused on the future but first-time visitors should not bypass the Dubai Museum. Housed in the restored Al-Fahidi Fort dating back to 1799, on the Bur Dubai side of the Creek, the mix of hands-on exhibits, static displays and hologram films presents an easily digested insight into the history, customs and life in the desert. Not far from the museum is the Bastakia quarter containing the few remaining examples of houses that were the residences of wealthy Iranian merchants with their unique windtowers - a pre-electric method of air-conditioning. Board an abra, one of the water taxis that crisscross the creek, to get your bearings or just walk along the dhow wharfage to get a flavour of the cargo being unloaded from India, South Africa and South East Asia. The second largest of the seven Emirates has historically traded lucratively on its location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa, bringing exotic woods and spices from India and silks from China. But Dubai's development suffered a hiccup in the 1930s when its pearl industry plunged into decline with the development of the cultured variety by the Japanese. Gold quickly replaced pearls as the precious commodity for trade when the enterprising Sheikh Rashid (Dubai's ruler at the time) sought other resources. Stroll along Deira's Sikkat Al Khail Street, the main artery of its renowned Gold Souk and be dazzled by window display upon window display of the metal in every shade and description, from intricate works of art to plain ingots. Here all that glitters with the lustre of gold will be genuine - stringent laws operate to vouchsafe authenticity. If you're not content with just window-shopping be prepared to play the game of bartering as part of the shopping experience and don't be surprised when scales are produced - gold is normally sold according to weight - design is usually immaterial. For light retail relief away from the malls, head for cooler climes of Hatta village, a favourite retreat in the Hajar Mountains with the urban crowd. Tours offer plenty of scope to go dune riding in a 4WD, explore the wadis (dried riverbeds) and rockpool oases and even try sandskiing. Having shopped until you drop during your stay and checked in more luggage than you recall bringing with you, Dubai airport's duty free shops will still beckon.

      "body": "<p> You get a lot of thinking done on a three-hour walk along a beach, especially if it happens to be empty and absurdly beautiful and soft as talcum and every cloud in the sky is off annoying the idiots who choose to live up in mainland Australia. Random thoughts: some big, some small. </p> <p>Thoughts such as: isn't this wonderful. Or: I wonder if this wave's going to reach my shorts. Or: maybe this one, then. Or: whee, yes! Or: I wonder if countries get the beaches they deserve (answer: probably. Think Austria, or Rwanda). And: how many oysters I can eat tonight - 30? 40? And: if only the buggers could see me now, the grim work buggers, who would seethe at my happiness. And: Tasmania is the most perfect country on God's earth. And, finally, the big one: why don't I just move here? It's been a week of unalloyed joy - why not keep it going? </p> <p>I won't, of course. They were beach thoughts, wet-foot thoughts. But there was nothing I could come up with, that day or since, which was not completely in Tassie's favour as a retreat. One, I suppose: it takes a long time to get there: another hour or two's flying after Melbourne. And, believe me, you don't want to come back. Sitting on the last night on the dockside in Hobart - prawns, sunset, boats, clinking bottles of the marvellous Pipers Brook Chardonnay - I was contemplating the trip home with the same grim horror which 1830s convicts must have felt on leaving England . </p> <p>In fact, I had already caught myself thinking naughtily, days before, as we blinked in the high hot sun over the gauzy and grandiose sweep of the bay at Stanley, which was the major northern port during the years of transportation - well, look, can it really have been that bad? I mean, your convicts would have come off the ship, grumbling queasily about the lack of proper entertainment or the annoying number of their relatives who had died nastily at sea or whatever, and seen this. Majesty. Sunshine. Green, green fields; mountains and forests; luscious sands, stretching impossibly. Wouldn't that have beaten whatever dank grey stinking northern dump they'd just been deported from? </p> <p>A stupid thought, of course. Obviously the land was a living hell. Read just half a chapter of Robert Hughes's magnificent The Fatal Shore , and you will be in no doubt about perhaps the most shaming period in Britain's not noticeably shame-free history. Not only did we use the experiment of an island jail to deport and beat and kill and enslave many thousands of our own; we wiped out the locals too. Every single native aborigine in Tasmania died. They were hunted down for sport. Today, a team of scientists from Hobart is spending its time in the interior trying to work out which roots and berries are poisonous or medicinal: thousand upon thousand of years' knowledge which whitey could have had for free had we bothered to let one native stay alive. You get hot flushes of retrospective anger and mortification. </p> <p>So, a stupid thought, but one that didn't go unthunk. Because Tassie is, today, close to paradise. It's the size of the Irish Republic but with the population of Croydon, which means it's deserted; but because of its situation, off the south coast of Oz, it's a bit more interesting than Ireland (though not, obviously, than Croydon; perish the thought). It's as if someone had taken Australia and crammed all the best bits into a bite-sized chunk; so you get rainforests, mountains, beaches and bars, impenetrable jungle waterways and lush, vivid meadows, all cosying up to each other and nothing over a couple of days' four-wheeled drive away. </p> <p>First stop, high in the hills, was Cradle Mountain and Dove Lake, around which we dragged our jet-lagged bodies with a reluctance soon dissipated by the magnificent surroundings. I had thought I would never eat again, having had about 17 airline meals in the past 12 hours, but we did, heartily, at both the Cradle Mountain and that night's retreat, the isolated Lemonthyme Lodge, learning swiftly that Tassie food and wine is, frankly, too good to leave to the Tasmanians. Pausing only to watch the the nightly feeding at the back porch, where possums, wallabies and wombats gather to be thrown scraps, we lumbered off to lovely beds the size of aircraft hangars and slept the sleep of the absolutely zonked. But in the morning all jet lag had fled, the sun was high and magnificent, a gargantuan breakfast was beckoning, and there then began seven of the best days of my life. </p> <p>The mountains had seemed impressive from below; skimming their tops from 5,000 feet in a little Cessna, they were awesome. The space, the emptiness, are almost scary; gazing down on some remote waterfall or forest, you think back on this island's history and you just know that man has never set foot on that spot, and possibly never will. </p> <p>Back on the ground, having skirted the rich farming country around Stanley and the old, old forests, where logging - the careful, sustainable stuff, for the whole eco thing is huge down here - provides the only roads, we filled up with yet another fine steak and fish barbie and several gallons of the wonderful Spring Vale wine (not available, tragically, in Britain, unless I decide to make my fortune by starting to import it), we turned a corner, bumped over dunes, and were confronted with one of the most glorious (and gloriously named) coastal panoramas on the planet. </p> <p>This little settlement, its white beaches pounded by grandiose seas which have run wild and unceasing from South America, is called The Edge of The World. Big seas, big space, big thoughts - this was where I first began entertaining bad thoughts about, basically, running away and coming here to live. Peace, freedom, beaches, sun, manic seas, a pub just up the road - and I mean, it's an address to die for. By now I was falling in love with this wild country. </p> <p>And the whole of that western coast is similar in scale and raw power, as the Pacific - Tasmania is bounded by no fewer than four oceans, each with its distinct character - keeps on keeping on, forever. Way up on the very north-west tip, where the Pacific meets the Bass Strait, lies Cape Grim, one of the most inspiring pieces of plungy-cliff architecture in the world, which reminded me strongly of Scotland's Cape Wrath and is equally swept with wind and history. </p> <p> Here, at the cape, sits the weather monitoring station that proves Tasmania does, literally, have the cleanest air in the world. (Tasmanians, normally so laid back as to make mainland Aussies look like screaming uptight anal retentives, will tell you of this fact slightly too often, along with the related one that they have the cleanest water in the world. It should irk, but, frankly, as long as they keep the good clean oysters coming they can be reading out lists of plankton counts in Welsh). </p> <p>The squat little station, perched by the very edge of the cliffs, has arrays of insanely sensitive monitors, designed to pick up one part of pollen in a million or whatever as the wind hits them fresh from Antarctica or the Americas. It is apparently a marvellous feat of engineering, a fact which I stupidly celebrated by lighting a cigarette about 20 feet away. I like to think of half a dozen technicians, fathoms below, suddenly ripping off their headphones with cries of fear as the monitors went loco, as if someone had begun pumping anthrax down the tubes, or someone in Tierra del Fuego had startedto play something by Andrew Lloyd-Webber. </p> <p>My only problem with the cape lies in the fact that it is 'owned' - how can someone 'own' a wild place like this? - by the Van Diemens Land Company, the conglomerate which farms the area and, basically, charges you to come in and stay at its ranch house and take its Land-Rover up to the cliffs. Very nice accommodation it was, too, but I couldn't help feeling this stuff should be free. Stephanie, the pleasant PR for the area, didn't seem to understand my increasingly guttural Marxist ranting, loyally repeating the words of the corporate mantra. The argument was truly going nowhere. So I waited until no one was looking, then pushed her off the cliff. </p> <p>Later that night, things got seriously good again, as we saw our first Tasmanian devils. The two-hour silent wait in the hide was well worth it, when finally, shockingly, alerted by the wet snuffles, our guide flicked on a low light to reveal two of the beasts ripping the bejesus out of a dead wallaby. The devils are truly horrible animals. They look like a cross between a pig and a dog. Nearly blind, they come out only to scavenge, and they will eat every bit of anything - each other, human babies - including bone and fur, crunching down with jaws which, pound for pound, have the same force as those of the Great White. Then they will let out the most terrible, guttural, blood-turning, buttock-clenching screams, the genesis of their name. </p> <p>On we went, through the warm and lazy vineyards around Launceston (where we had been shocked to see - yes - a traffic light) to the most memorable two nights of the trip. </p> <p>The Bay of Fires Lodge, reached after a long and bumpy four-wheel ride, sits above the Tasman Sea, high on the north-east corner. I almost don't want to give away any more; it's so remote, and so beautiful, that I don't want anyone else to know the precise location. Here, anyway, for the next two days, we swam, and walked, and walked, and swam, and body-surfed, and walked some more, retreating each evening to the magnificent new timbered eco-lodge, where the guides - all young, all apparently supermodels, all intensely knowledgable about the wildlife and history but, crucially, fun with it - would prepare groaning galleys of seafood and ply us with ludicrous amounts of Spring Vale until we passed out, replete, high above the midnight surf. </p> <p>The eco stuff is big here, but it's not in-your-face. So there are composting toilets, and you pump through your own water for the showers, but apart from that you don't notice; you simply seem to learn more about it all, through osmosis. By the end of our stay I had even begun picking up my cigarette butts. But by then I was a changed man; I was Mountain Boy. Surf Boy. Nature Boy. Bronzed and happy, and I had walked bloody miles the previous day, and felt better than for years. And I'd had the Big Thoughts. </p> <p> We practically had to be dragged away from the Bay of Fires. The memories swim back instantly, many weeks later; it's like finding summer sand in your shoes at Christmas. But we had another appointment, down at the world-famous Wineglass Bay, which sounded good, featuring as it did the words 'bay' and 'wine'. And 'glass'. </p> <p>There should be a word - there must be a word - for that awful moment when, having spent two baking hours lugging your body and half a dozen bottles of chilled beer up and over a huge hill to one of the most secluded, beautiful beaches in the world, sweating throughout like a politician on Judgment Day, and then, having slumped dugong-like on the beach's sublime emptiness in the knowledge that you not only want and need the beer but for once actually deserve it, you find you've forgotten a bottle-opener. </p> <p>Fortunately this didn't happen as I'd bought one earlier, this seeming easier at the time than making up a new word. So we slaked and swam and lolled about, facing inland, for the beach was the wrong way round that day, which is to say both the sun and wind were coming from behind, which was odd but interesting, like having the taps at your back. This is the most famous beach in Tasmania, one of the most famous beaches in Australasia, and there were only the four of us on it. Count us: four. The Freycinet Lodge looked tempting, in a comfortable four-star way, and it did provide us with a fine lunch and an excellent bottle-opener, but we were too close to nature now to go back, so that night was spent at the Bluestone Bay camp - more fine guides, bush showers all round, wine and food and kookaburras, and a good long hike the next day to the Friendly Beaches Lodge, Bluestone's parent camp, lying at the end of, yes, yet another long and beautiful beach (yawn), and another evening of fine food and conversation and gentle surf (snore). </p> <p>Also, in a way, you don't really want five-star accommodation when you're here. It was good, on the last night, to stay, in Hobart, in suites at the Oakford on Elizabeth Pier, to wash clothes and shave and preen and dress up for the last evening; but I would have forgone it all just to know that it wasn't our last night. We had run out of time, just as I have, infuriatingly, run out of space. I didn't even mention the dolphins - swimming with the dolphins in the last of our four seas, the Great Southern Ocean, after a marvellous roar of a day exploring at sea with Robert Pennicott's charter-boat Albatross. I seem to have left out half a dozen fine bays, and a range of mountains or two, perhaps even an ocean. There's too much to say, too much to write, too much to do. Go. Simply go. And look me up if you make it to the Edge of the World. </p> <p><strong> Tasmania facts</strong><br> </p> <p> Euan Ferguson flew to Tasmania via Melbourne with Singapore Airlines and Ansett Australia.

      "bodyText": "You get a lot of thinking done on a three-hour walk along a beach, especially if it happens to be empty and absurdly beautiful and soft as talcum and every cloud in the sky is off annoying the idiots who choose to live up in mainland Australia. Random thoughts: some big, some small. Thoughts such as: isn't this wonderful. Or: I wonder if this wave's going to reach my shorts. Or: maybe this one, then. Or: whee, yes! Or: I wonder if countries get the beaches they deserve (answer: probably. Think Austria, or Rwanda). And: how many oysters I can eat tonight - 30? 40? And: if only the buggers could see me now, the grim work buggers, who would seethe at my happiness. And: Tasmania is the most perfect country on God's earth. And, finally, the big one: why don't I just move here? It's been a week of unalloyed joy - why not keep it going? I won't, of course. They were beach thoughts, wet-foot thoughts. But there was nothing I could come up with, that day or since, which was not completely in Tassie's favour as a retreat. One, I suppose: it takes a long time to get there: another hour or two's flying after Melbourne. And, believe me, you don't want to come back. Sitting on the last night on the dockside in Hobart - prawns, sunset, boats, clinking bottles of the marvellous Pipers Brook Chardonnay - I was contemplating the trip home with the same grim horror which 1830s convicts must have felt on leaving England . In fact, I had already caught myself thinking naughtily, days before, as we blinked in the high hot sun over the gauzy and grandiose sweep of the bay at Stanley, which was the major northern port during the years of transportation - well, look, can it really have been that bad? I mean, your convicts would have come off the ship, grumbling queasily about the lack of proper entertainment or the annoying number of their relatives who had died nastily at sea or whatever, and seen this. Majesty. Sunshine. Green, green fields; mountains and forests; luscious sands, stretching impossibly. Wouldn't that have beaten whatever dank grey stinking northern dump they'd just been deported from? A stupid thought, of course. Obviously the land was a living hell. Read just half a chapter of Robert Hughes's magnificent The Fatal Shore , and you will be in no doubt about perhaps the most shaming period in Britain's not noticeably shame-free history. Not only did we use the experiment of an island jail to deport and beat and kill and enslave many thousands of our own; we wiped out the locals too. Every single native aborigine in Tasmania died. They were hunted down for sport. Today, a team of scientists from Hobart is spending its time in the interior trying to work out which roots and berries are poisonous or medicinal: thousand upon thousand of years' knowledge which whitey could have had for free had we bothered to let one native stay alive. You get hot flushes of retrospective anger and mortification. So, a stupid thought, but one that didn't go unthunk. Because Tassie is, today, close to paradise. It's the size of the Irish Republic but with the population of Croydon, which means it's deserted; but because of its situation, off the south coast of Oz, it's a bit more interesting than Ireland (though not, obviously, than Croydon; perish the thought). It's as if someone had taken Australia and crammed all the best bits into a bite-sized chunk; so you get rainforests, mountains, beaches and bars, impenetrable jungle waterways and lush, vivid meadows, all cosying up to each other and nothing over a couple of days' four-wheeled drive away. First stop, high in the hills, was Cradle Mountain and Dove Lake, around which we dragged our jet-lagged bodies with a reluctance soon dissipated by the magnificent surroundings. I had thought I would never eat again, having had about 17 airline meals in the past 12 hours, but we did, heartily, at both the Cradle Mountain and that night's retreat, the isolated Lemonthyme Lodge, learning swiftly that Tassie food and wine is, frankly, too good to leave to the Tasmanians. Pausing only to watch the the nightly feeding at the back porch, where possums, wallabies and wombats gather to be thrown scraps, we lumbered off to lovely beds the size of aircraft hangars and slept the sleep of the absolutely zonked. But in the morning all jet lag had fled, the sun was high and magnificent, a gargantuan breakfast was beckoning, and there then began seven of the best days of my life. The mountains had seemed impressive from below; skimming their tops from 5,000 feet in a little Cessna, they were awesome. The space, the emptiness, are almost scary; gazing down on some remote waterfall or forest, you think back on this island's history and you just know that man has never set foot on that spot, and possibly never will. Back on the ground, having skirted the rich farming country around Stanley and the old, old forests, where logging - the careful, sustainable stuff, for the whole eco thing is huge down here - provides the only roads, we filled up with yet another fine steak and fish barbie and several gallons of the wonderful Spring Vale wine (not available, tragically, in Britain, unless I decide to make my fortune by starting to import it), we turned a corner, bumped over dunes, and were confronted with one of the most glorious (and gloriously named) coastal panoramas on the planet. This little settlement, its white beaches pounded by grandiose seas which have run wild and unceasing from South America, is called The Edge of The World. Big seas, big space, big thoughts - this was where I first began entertaining bad thoughts about, basically, running away and coming here to live. Peace, freedom, beaches, sun, manic seas, a pub just up the road - and I mean, it's an address to die for. By now I was falling in love with this wild country. And the whole of that western coast is similar in scale and raw power, as the Pacific - Tasmania is bounded by no fewer than four oceans, each with its distinct character - keeps on keeping on, forever. Way up on the very north-west tip, where the Pacific meets the Bass Strait, lies Cape Grim, one of the most inspiring pieces of plungy-cliff architecture in the world, which reminded me strongly of Scotland's Cape Wrath and is equally swept with wind and history. Here, at the cape, sits the weather monitoring station that proves Tasmania does, literally, have the cleanest air in the world. (Tasmanians, normally so laid back as to make mainland Aussies look like screaming uptight anal retentives, will tell you of this fact slightly too often, along with the related one that they have the cleanest water in the world. It should irk, but, frankly, as long as they keep the good clean oysters coming they can be reading out lists of plankton counts in Welsh). The squat little station, perched by the very edge of the cliffs, has arrays of insanely sensitive monitors, designed to pick up one part of pollen in a million or whatever as the wind hits them fresh from Antarctica or the Americas. It is apparently a marvellous feat of engineering, a fact which I stupidly celebrated by lighting a cigarette about 20 feet away. I like to think of half a dozen technicians, fathoms below, suddenly ripping off their headphones with cries of fear as the monitors went loco, as if someone had begun pumping anthrax down the tubes, or someone in Tierra del Fuego had startedto play something by Andrew Lloyd-Webber. My only problem with the cape lies in the fact that it is 'owned' - how can someone 'own' a wild place like this? - by the Van Diemens Land Company, the conglomerate which farms the area and, basically, charges you to come in and stay at its ranch house and take its Land-Rover up to the cliffs. Very nice accommodation it was, too, but I couldn't help feeling this stuff should be free. Stephanie, the pleasant PR for the area, didn't seem to understand my increasingly guttural Marxist ranting, loyally repeating the words of the corporate mantra. The argument was truly going nowhere. So I waited until no one was looking, then pushed her off the cliff. Later that night, things got seriously good again, as we saw our first Tasmanian devils. The two-hour silent wait in the hide was well worth it, when finally, shockingly, alerted by the wet snuffles, our guide flicked on a low light to reveal two of the beasts ripping the bejesus out of a dead wallaby. The devils are truly horrible animals. They look like a cross between a pig and a dog. Nearly blind, they come out only to scavenge, and they will eat every bit of anything - each other, human babies - including bone and fur, crunching down with jaws which, pound for pound, have the same force as those of the Great White. Then they will let out the most terrible, guttural, blood-turning, buttock-clenching screams, the genesis of their name. On we went, through the warm and lazy vineyards around Launceston (where we had been shocked to see - yes - a traffic light) to the most memorable two nights of the trip. The Bay of Fires Lodge, reached after a long and bumpy four-wheel ride, sits above the Tasman Sea, high on the north-east corner. I almost don't want to give away any more; it's so remote, and so beautiful, that I don't want anyone else to know the precise location. Here, anyway, for the next two days, we swam, and walked, and walked, and swam, and body-surfed, and walked some more, retreating each evening to the magnificent new timbered eco-lodge, where the guides - all young, all apparently supermodels, all intensely knowledgable about the wildlife and history but, crucially, fun with it - would prepare groaning galleys of seafood and ply us with ludicrous amounts of Spring Vale until we passed out, replete, high above the midnight surf. The eco stuff is big here, but it's not in-your-face. So there are composting toilets, and you pump through your own water for the showers, but apart from that you don't notice; you simply seem to learn more about it all, through osmosis. By the end of our stay I had even begun picking up my cigarette butts. But by then I was a changed man; I was Mountain Boy. Surf Boy. Nature Boy. Bronzed and happy, and I had walked bloody miles the previous day, and felt better than for years. And I'd had the Big Thoughts. We practically had to be dragged away from the Bay of Fires. The memories swim back instantly, many weeks later; it's like finding summer sand in your shoes at Christmas. But we had another appointment, down at the world-famous Wineglass Bay, which sounded good, featuring as it did the words 'bay' and 'wine'. And 'glass'. There should be a word - there must be a word - for that awful moment when, having spent two baking hours lugging your body and half a dozen bottles of chilled beer up and over a huge hill to one of the most secluded, beautiful beaches in the world, sweating throughout like a politician on Judgment Day, and then, having slumped dugong-like on the beach's sublime emptiness in the knowledge that you not only want and need the beer but for once actually deserve it, you find you've forgotten a bottle-opener. Fortunately this didn't happen as I'd bought one earlier, this seeming easier at the time than making up a new word. So we slaked and swam and lolled about, facing inland, for the beach was the wrong way round that day, which is to say both the sun and wind were coming from behind, which was odd but interesting, like having the taps at your back. This is the most famous beach in Tasmania, one of the most famous beaches in Australasia, and there were only the four of us on it. Count us: four. The Freycinet Lodge looked tempting, in a comfortable four-star way, and it did provide us with a fine lunch and an excellent bottle-opener, but we were too close to nature now to go back, so that night was spent at the Bluestone Bay camp - more fine guides, bush showers all round, wine and food and kookaburras, and a good long hike the next day to the Friendly Beaches Lodge, Bluestone's parent camp, lying at the end of, yes, yet another long and beautiful beach (yawn), and another evening of fine food and conversation and gentle surf (snore). Also, in a way, you don't really want five-star accommodation when you're here. It was good, on the last night, to stay, in Hobart, in suites at the Oakford on Elizabeth Pier, to wash clothes and shave and preen and dress up for the last evening; but I would have forgone it all just to know that it wasn't our last night. We had run out of time, just as I have, infuriatingly, run out of space. I didn't even mention the dolphins - swimming with the dolphins in the last of our four seas, the Great Southern Ocean, after a marvellous roar of a day exploring at sea with Robert Pennicott's charter-boat Albatross. I seem to have left out half a dozen fine bays, and a range of mountains or two, perhaps even an ocean. There's too much to say, too much to write, too much to do. Go. Simply go. And look me up if you make it to the Edge of the World. Tasmania facts Euan Ferguson flew to Tasmania via Melbourne with Singapore Airlines and Ansett Australia.

      "body": "<p>Prostitute, hooker, whore, call-girl, harlot, streetwalker, woman of the night, concubine, trollop, tart - Don Simpson liked a whole range of different women. But the doomed larger-than-life producer's predilection for paid sex was endemic of Hollywood's age-old obsession with the oldest profession: the movie whore has always been with us (and I'm not talking about film critics). </p> <p>Few were surprised when Simpson was revealed to be a serial employer of prostitutes in 1995's You'll Never Make Love In This Town Again by hooker Tiffany ('The dominatrix forced the girl to lean over the toilet - etc.'). You see, the busy boys that run Hollywood do not always have the time to develop meaningful relationships with women, poor things. In the Eighties, it all got out of hand, of course, and call-girls became as common at Hollywood parties as trays of nibbles (in the Simpson biography, High Concept, producer Steve Roth says: 'We were so hot and so rich and there was nothing but cocaine and hookers and millions of laughs.') </p> <p>Prostitution went very much legit in 1990 with that kerbside Pygmalion, Pretty Woman . Julia Roberts, Oscar-nominated for her Sunset streetwalker Vivian Ward, was a landmark in the portrayal of the profession on screen: she was a Disney prostitute - the clearest sign yet that under Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg the studio was finally moving out of the 1930s. </p> <p>The idea of a white knight (Richard Gere) 'rescuing' a fallen woman may not have been new, but the film's slick, smart, pop-soundtracked presentation was. It was very good box office but not everyone approved. That year, Meryl Streep delivered an inflammatory keynote speech at the Screen Actors Guild's first-ever women's conference. The success of Pretty Woman, she said, seemed to indicate that 'the chief occupation of women on earth was hooking. And I don't mean rugs'. </p> <p>There's little of the Disney prostitute about Katrin Cartlidge, the lead in Claire Dolan , the assured new film from young American director Lodge Kerrigan. Dolan's business is tracked by Kerrigan with a steely gaze, and a deal of wit, and the woman herself has no choice but to be her own white knight </p> <p>Back in the Thirties, when prostitution was unmentionable by name, the movies were full of ladies of ill-repute, from the literary - Joan Crawford as Somerset Maugham's Sadie Thompson in Rain; Greta Garbo as the eponymous ex-whore on a barge in Anna Christie and Clara Bow as the half-breed Indian in Call Her Savage . In 1932, Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express made Marlene Dietrich a legend, playing Shanghai Lily, 'the White Flower of the Chinese Coast', a woman who, in Alexander Walker's book Sex In The Movies, is described as having a 'soiled soul' (even critics resort to euphemisms). </p> <p>Screen prostitutes quickly fell into two types: those who were trying to get out of the game (cue: helping hand from benevolent Richard Gere figure), or those who were forced into it by circumstance, such as Vivien Leigh's respectable Myra Lester in the 1940 World War II romance Waterloo Bridge . A ballet dancer fired for taking time off to say goodbye to her conscripted lover, Leigh turns to prostitution to make ends meet - the story was filmed again in 1956 as Gaby with Leslie Caron, and the blueprint later served Paris, Texas, with its moving climax in which Harry Dean Stanton pays to see his estranged wife Nastassja Kinski. </p> <p> It took an arthouse comedy from Greece to really turn the screen prostitute stereotype on its head. In 1960, Never On Sunday proved an unlikely hit in America; Melina Mercouri plays Ilya, the whore who's proud of her work and who keeps Sundays free for going to the theatre (This sense of empowerment was echoed in Belle De Jour by Catherine Deneuve, who only worked afternoons). European cinema was, naturally, way ahead of Hollywood. Sophia Loren couldn't stop playing prostitutes, whether in Lady L , Marriage Italian Style , Boccaccio 70 , Man Of La Mancha or Yesterday, Today And Tomorrow (Vittorio de Sica's trilogy, of which the third segment concerns a Roman prostitute with whom a priest has fallen in love). Mind you, Shirley MacLaine was also prolific in this area, playing a floozy in Some Came Running in 1958 and a Paris streetwalker (pictured) in Irma La Douce (with Jack Lemmon as her saviour). </p> <p>At the beginning of the Sixties, MGM were still worried that Elizabeth Taylor's loose woman Gloria Wandrous in Butterfield 8 was showing too much cleavage (director Daniel Mann sent back a memo saying, 'She's a hooker, for Christ's sake, not a Mother Superior'), but by the end of the decade, things loosened up, and in 1969, the male prostitute arrived, in the form of Midnight Cowboy and John Voigt's Texan stud Joe Buck. The lingering censoriousness of the swinging decade can be seen in the tagline for 1962's Walk On The Wild Side, about a New Orleans brothel: 'A side of life you never expected to see on the screen!' </p> <p>In the Seventies and Eighties, prostitutes became icons, such as Jodie Foster's Iris in Taxi Driver, Jane Fonda's Bree Daniels in Klute and Teresa Russell's China Blue in Crimes Of Passion. Taxi Driver paved the way for further teen prostitutes, such as George C. Scott's daughter in Paul Schrader's Hardcore, and Kate Hardie in Mona Lisa, with Brooke Shields's decorous 12-year-old Violet in Pretty Baby another can of worms altogether. </p> <p>In the Nineties, post- Pretty Woman , prostitutes could even be offbeat heroines, such as Quentin Tarantino's fantasy female Alabama (Patricia Arquette) in True Romance, who, after just three days on the job, brazenly aspires to become a high-class call-girl ('They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know like Nancy Allen in Dressed To Kill '). </p> <p>In Leaving Las Vegas , Sera, played by Elizabeth Shue, is Nicolas Cage's angel, thus confirming that the 'tart with a heart' stereotype is an enduring one. This month's American Psycho also proves that the prostitute as serial-killer fodder is alive and well, if not for long, and the latest Saturday Night Live spin-off Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo at least reminds us that there is humour to be had in this area, albeit limited to Jamie Lee Curtis's wig in Trading Places, Michael Palin's fallen women in The Missionary, and Joan Sims's travelling brothel, 'Les Oiseaux des Paradis' in Carry On Dick . </p> <p>And what of Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton in The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas ? Well, Don Simpson probably found it 'a million laughs'.</p>",

In the Eighties, it all got out of hand, of course, and call-girls became as common at Hollywood parties as trays of nibbles (in the Simpson biography, High Concept, producer Steve Roth says: 'We were so hot and so rich and there was nothing but cocaine and hookers and millions of laughs.') Prostitution went very much legit in 1990 with that kerbside Pygmalion, Pretty Woman . Julia Roberts, Oscar-nominated for her Sunset streetwalker Vivian Ward, was a landmark in the portrayal of the profession on screen: she was a Disney prostitute - the clearest sign yet that under Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg the studio was finally moving out of the 1930s. The idea of a white knight (Richard Gere) 'rescuing' a fallen woman may not have been new, but the film's slick, smart, pop-soundtracked presentation was. It was very good box office but not everyone approved. That year, Meryl Streep delivered an inflammatory keynote speech at the Screen Actors Guild's first-ever women's conference. The success of Pretty Woman, she said, seemed to indicate that 'the chief occupation of women on earth was hooking. And I don't mean rugs'. There's little of the Disney prostitute about Katrin Cartlidge, the lead in Claire Dolan , the assured new film from young American director Lodge Kerrigan. Dolan's business is tracked by Kerrigan with a steely gaze, and a deal of wit, and the woman herself has no choice but to be her own white knight Back in the Thirties, when prostitution was unmentionable by name, the movies were full of ladies of ill-repute, from the literary - Joan Crawford as Somerset Maugham's Sadie Thompson in Rain; Greta Garbo as the eponymous ex-whore on a barge in Anna Christie and Clara Bow as the half-breed Indian in Call Her Savage . In 1932, Josef von Sternberg's Shanghai Express made Marlene Dietrich a legend, playing Shanghai Lily, 'the White Flower of the Chinese Coast', a woman who, in Alexander Walker's book Sex In The Movies, is described as having a 'soiled soul' (even critics resort to euphemisms). Screen prostitutes quickly fell into two types: those who were trying to get out of the game (cue: helping hand from benevolent Richard Gere figure), or those who were forced into it by circumstance, such as Vivien Leigh's respectable Myra Lester in the 1940 World War II romance Waterloo Bridge . A ballet dancer fired for taking time off to say goodbye to her conscripted lover, Leigh turns to prostitution to make ends meet - the story was filmed again in 1956 as Gaby with Leslie Caron, and the blueprint later served Paris, Texas, with its moving climax in which Harry Dean Stanton pays to see his estranged wife Nastassja Kinski. It took an arthouse comedy from Greece to really turn the screen prostitute stereotype on its head. In 1960, Never On Sunday proved an unlikely hit in America; Melina Mercouri plays Ilya, the whore who's proud of her work and who keeps Sundays free for going to the theatre (This sense of empowerment was echoed in Belle De Jour by Catherine Deneuve, who only worked afternoons). European cinema was, naturally, way ahead of Hollywood. Sophia Loren couldn't stop playing prostitutes, whether in Lady L , Marriage Italian Style , Boccaccio 70 , Man Of La Mancha or Yesterday, Today And Tomorrow (Vittorio de Sica's trilogy, of which the third segment concerns a Roman prostitute with whom a priest has fallen in love). Mind you, Shirley MacLaine was also prolific in this area, playing a floozy in Some Came Running in 1958 and a Paris streetwalker (pictured) in Irma La Douce (with Jack Lemmon as her saviour). At the beginning of the Sixties, MGM were still worried that Elizabeth Taylor's loose woman Gloria Wandrous in Butterfield 8 was showing too much cleavage (director Daniel Mann sent back a memo saying, 'She's a hooker, for Christ's sake, not a Mother Superior'), but by the end of the decade, things loosened up, and in 1969, the male prostitute arrived, in the form of Midnight Cowboy and John Voigt's Texan stud Joe Buck. The lingering censoriousness of the swinging decade can be seen in the tagline for 1962's Walk On The Wild Side, about a New Orleans brothel: 'A side of life you never expected to see on the screen!' In the Seventies and Eighties, prostitutes became icons, such as Jodie Foster's Iris in Taxi Driver, Jane Fonda's Bree Daniels in Klute and Teresa Russell's China Blue in Crimes Of Passion. Taxi Driver paved the way for further teen prostitutes, such as George C. Scott's daughter in Paul Schrader's Hardcore, and Kate Hardie in Mona Lisa, with Brooke Shields's decorous 12-year-old Violet in Pretty Baby another can of worms altogether. In the Nineties, post- Pretty Woman , prostitutes could even be offbeat heroines, such as Quentin Tarantino's fantasy female Alabama (Patricia Arquette) in True Romance, who, after just three days on the job, brazenly aspires to become a high-class call-girl ('They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know like Nancy Allen in Dressed To Kill '). In Leaving Las Vegas , Sera, played by Elizabeth Shue, is Nicolas Cage's angel, thus confirming that the 'tart with a heart' stereotype is an enduring one. This month's American Psycho also proves that the prostitute as serial-killer fodder is alive and well, if not for long, and the latest Saturday Night Live spin-off Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo at least reminds us that there is humour to be had in this area, albeit limited to Jamie Lee Curtis's wig in Trading Places, Michael Palin's fallen women in The Missionary, and Joan Sims's travelling brothel, 'Les Oiseaux des Paradis' in Carry On Dick . And what of Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton in The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas ? Well, Don Simpson probably found it 'a million laughs'.",

      "body": "<p>High in the Trump Tower at 721 Fifth Avenue lives an angry German. Lothar Matth\u00e4us complains that apartments in New York are tiny, the kitchens even smaller, and the streets clogged with yellow taxis. One of the few things he has in common with other New Yorkers is that he speaks almost no English. </p> <p>Only six weeks since moving here to play for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, he seems to think he made a mistake. Matth\u00e4us is, as they say in America, in a bad place, living a bizarre inversion of the American Dream: arrive a millionaire, work very little and end up with nothing. It all adds up to terrible news for Germany. </p> <p>Just before he left Bayern Munich, I asked Matth\u00e4us how he would cope in a team of not very good players. Last season the MetroStars ran up the worst record in Major League soccer history, winning seven, losing 25 and earning the moniker of 'the worst team in the world'. Matth\u00e4us replied that although they might not be the most gifted footballers, as long as they worked hard, that was OK. </p> <p>Last week I went to watch them play the Kansas City Wizards. The first eight cab drivers I asked to take me refused, explaining, in a sort of English, that they had never heard of Giants Stadium. Finally I found an Indian who had also never heard of it but was willing to look. I arrived to find Matth\u00e4us charging around the pitch acting, as they say in New York, like a crazy. Every time a team-mate touched the ball, he waved his arms and screamed. </p> <p>When the MetroStars scored, his team-mates understandably cheered, and on the big screen a pair of Thirties comedians danced around a table, but Matth\u00e4us simply grew angrier. </p> <p>Things got worse when the Wizards, featuring the virtually moribund 37-year-old Scotsman Mo Johnston, scored twice. Matth\u00e4us, as they say here, freaked. At one point he threw his captain's armband at the linesman, a tough-looking individual named Chip Reed, who simply threw the thing back. </p> <p>A few minutes later Matth\u00e4us ran over to the touchline to eyeball Reed, but Reed just eyeballed him back. Matth\u00e4us spent most of the rest of the match wandering around the pitch muttering to himself like a bum in the subway. </p> <p>When the game ended with the score still 1-2, he kicked the ball away, chucked his shirt at the 20 or so youths behind one goal who constitute the MetroStars' self-conscious hard core, and stalked off. </p> <p>After the game, he explained that his tantrum had been a ploy to motivate his team-mates. Their coach, Octavio Zambrano, showed the German superstar who was boss: 'If he genuinely believed that he was trying to wake up the guys, then what can I say? I can't punish him for that.' The team's keeper, Mike Ammann, veteran of English soccer, said he saw Matth\u00e4us's point: if certain guys in the team were too dumb to listen, what could you do? </p> <p>However, if things continue like this Matth\u00e4us will soon be as dumb as his team-mates. That could be embarrassing. In June he is due to play libero for Germany in the European Championship, arguably the toughest football tournament in the world. The MetroStars are ruining his game. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us is 39 now, and for years, playing for Bayern Munich and Germany, he has barely touched the ball or tackled anyone. His role is chiefly administrative. But it remains crucial. He makes German football tick. </p> <p>Better than any other team, Germany can alternate the pace of the game. If they go a goal down they double the pace, forcing the other team into errors, and committing fouls to ruin their opponents' concentration. </p> <p>Conversely, if they go a goal up, they take all pace out of the game: whenever they win a free-kick they wait 30 seconds before taking it, and if their riled opponents then commit fouls, the Germans dive to win more free-kicks, or, ideally, get someone sent off. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us initiates these changes of pace, grabbing the ball when the opposition wants to take a corner or a free-kick, determining the tempo like an orchestra conductor. </p> <p>But playing no-good football with big-time losers dulls your sense of the game. Watching Matth\u00e4us at the MetroStars, I was reminded of seeing Ruud Gullit play for the fifth team of an Amsterdam amateur club in January. </p> <p>Gullit, only 37 years old, looked as if he had forgotten how to play football. At half-time, his side were 5-0 down. Matth\u00e4us seems to be descending almost as fast. New York is no place for this hick from the German sticks who likes being a hick. As he gazes down at Central Park from his four-room apartment, he might think of a song for guitar that another immigrant to this city wrote 25 years ago: </p> <p>Open the gate, </p> <p>I want to return, </p> <p>Here I don't have </p> <p>What I had there. </p> <p>Open the gate, </p> <p>I want to return, </p> <p>New York is making me cry. </p> <p>The words, originally written in Portuguese during his spell at the Cosmos, are by Pele. </p>",

Things got worse when the Wizards, featuring the virtually moribund 37-year-old Scotsman Mo Johnston, scored twice. Matth\u00e4us, as they say here, freaked. At one point he threw his captain's armband at the linesman, a tough-looking individual named Chip Reed, who simply threw the thing back. A few minutes later Matth\u00e4us ran over to the touchline to eyeball Reed, but Reed just eyeballed him back. Matth\u00e4us spent most of the rest of the match wandering around the pitch muttering to himself like a bum in the subway. When the game ended with the score still 1-2, he kicked the ball away, chucked his shirt at the 20 or so youths behind one goal who constitute the MetroStars' self-conscious hard core, and stalked off. After the game, he explained that his tantrum had been a ploy to motivate his team-mates. Their coach, Octavio Zambrano, showed the German superstar who was boss: 'If he genuinely believed that he was trying to wake up the guys, then what can I say? I can't punish him for that.' The team's keeper, Mike Ammann, veteran of English soccer, said he saw Matth\u00e4us's point: if certain guys in the team were too dumb to listen, what could you do? However, if things continue like this Matth\u00e4us will soon be as dumb as his team-mates. That could be embarrassing. In June he is due to play libero for Germany in the European Championship, arguably the toughest football tournament in the world. The MetroStars are ruining his game. Matth\u00e4us is 39 now, and for years, playing for Bayern Munich and Germany, he has barely touched the ball or tackled anyone. His role is chiefly administrative. But it remains crucial. He makes German football tick. Better than any other team, Germany can alternate the pace of the game. If they go a goal down they double the pace, forcing the other team into errors, and committing fouls to ruin their opponents' concentration. Conversely, if they go a goal up, they take all pace out of the game: whenever they win a free-kick they wait 30 seconds before taking it, and if their riled opponents then commit fouls, the Germans dive to win more free-kicks, or, ideally, get someone sent off. Matth\u00e4us initiates these changes of pace, grabbing the ball when the opposition wants to take a corner or a free-kick, determining the tempo like an orchestra conductor. But playing no-good football with big-time losers dulls your sense of the game. Watching Matth\u00e4us at the MetroStars, I was reminded of seeing Ruud Gullit play for the fifth team of an Amsterdam amateur club in January. Gullit, only 37 years old, looked as if he had forgotten how to play football. At half-time, his side were 5-0 down. Matth\u00e4us seems to be descending almost as fast. New York is no place for this hick from the German sticks who likes being a hick. As he gazes down at Central Park from his four-room apartment, he might think of a song for guitar that another immigrant to this city wrote 25 years ago: Open the gate, I want to return, Here I don't have What I had there. Open the gate, I want to return, New York is making me cry. The words, originally written in Portuguese during his spell at the Cosmos, are by Pele.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>With a record of 434 League goals, 27 hat-tricks and 52 penalties, it's little wonder that G. Arthur Rowley was known as 'The Netbuster'. </p> <p>For 20 seasons, the 'King of Goals' banged the heavy, old-fashioned, leather ball into the net from every angle, often from more than 20 yards. In 1961, 18,917 turned up at Gay Meadow to watch him equal Dixie Dean's record of 379 League goals with a first-half penalty against Walsall. </p> <p>Three days later, at Valley Parade, the record was his. Asked at the time how he felt, he replied: 'Has it helped my club?' Asked last week, he replied: 'The team came in front of my record. Obviously if I scored goals it meant the team were doing well. But the team were always more important.' Two seasons later, he broke Jimmy McGrory's British record of 410 with a goal against Millwall. </p> <p>His epic scoring feats are the stuff of comic books, but Rowley - thick-set with huge hands and wonky knees and a carefully sculpted hairstyle that hasn't changed for half a century - would not fit comfortably alongside flamboyant characters such as Roy of the Rovers, Jimmy of the City and Bobby of the Blues. Arthur of the Town belongs more to Arnold Bennett than Tiger or Scorcher and Score. </p> <p>He could have scored a lot more, of course, if it hadn't been for the War. 'I'd work in the factory all Friday night and the Wolves would ring up on Saturday morning and ask if I would come along and play. I was only 15,16. It was when the old Major [Frank Buckley] was there. You used to have to march to attention underneath the stand. He thought he was still in the army.' </p> <p>Rowley joined the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, played alongside Wilf Mannion and Alf Ramsey in a team that beat an Arab representative side 9-1 in Haifa, then captained the Army Cup winning side. On his return, in 1947, he went to West Brom. 'I was just out of the army, just had my tonsils out and the chairman said, \"You're not doing very well.\" That was that.' </p> <p>Then to Fulham, for whom he scored 19 in a 22-match run - to give them the Second Division championship and promotion to the First Division for the first time in their history. He was transferred to Leicester City for \u00a314,000. 'I got nothing,' says Rowley. 'You'd get more than 10 per cent now.' </p> <p>Leicester proved to be his golden period - 251 goals in 303 games - and twice they won promotion to the First Division. Despite this success, he was never selected for England. 'I played for the wrong club,' says Rowley. 'The England team were chosen by the club directors from different clubs so it helped if you were at the right club. But when I was at Leicester I played for the Football League XI which was better than the England team.'</p> <p>Does it bother him? 'You think about these things, but you were getting paid to play for your club and that's what you did. If I had been chosen for England it would have been a great honour. But it didn't happen.' Who set up the goals for him at Leicester? 'I set 'em up myself, although Mal Griffiths was a great crosser of the ball.' </p> <p>Despite his scoring record, it became obvious that 'Leicester didn't want me. So I got the club secretary to ring up Shrewsbury to see if it was worth applying and came up for an interview. I knew the area. I was in the army at Shrewsbury and I can still see the huts from where I live now'. </p> <p>He was appointed player-manager. He stayed for 10 years - four as inside-left, three as centre-half, three as manager - and took the Town to the brink of Division Two. Then he made 'the worst mistake I ever made' by going to manage Sheffield United. </p> <p>'I happened to pick the wrong club,' he says. 'Some one offers you a better job and you try and take it. I didn't enjoy my time there. The team I left got promotion the following year.' He briefly managed Southend but, after relegation, he left under a cloud. </p> <p>Since then, he has stayed in Shropshire and supported The Town. 'They've named the players' bar after me and I appreciate that because it shows they appreciate what I've done.' In a supporters' poll for Shrewsbury's player of the century, Rowley won by a country mile. </p> <p>These are dark days for The Town, who were founded in 1886 and elected to the Third Division (North) in 1950 - but are now perilously close to dropping out of the League. </p> <p>The Seventies and Eighties were good but the Nineties less good,' says Freddie Fry, Shrewsbury's president. </p> <p>Fry, who looks like Mr Rumbold merged with Dick Emery, was on the Shrewsbury board for 30 years from 1965 and has been president ever since. 'The big change is that we were in the old Second Division and playing Newcastle, West Ham, Sunderland, Leeds and Man City. And at that time we shared the gate money so an away game at Roker Park, say, might bring in four times as much as a home game.' </p> <p>This change, along with the injection of Sky money and the Bosman ruling, has rid football of any redistributive element. The rich get richer; the poor get poorer. </p> <p>'It's very difficult to balance the books and persuade players to stay because they can always do better somewhere else. There are too many sheep around here and they don't watch football,' says Fry. </p> <p>The proliferation of sheep has meant the directors have had to dip into their pockets. 'I don't agree with people having to put money into a football club. It should stand on its own two feet. Every club I managed I always left in the black,' says Rowley. </p> <p>Despite the board subsidising the club, the debts persist and even if they maintain their League status Gay Meadow will have to be sold. </p> <p>'I'll be sorry to see it go because I more or less built it while I was here with the proceeds from transferring players and cup runs,' says Rowley. </p> <p>'We will all be very sad,' says Fry. 'The new ground will be called The Meadow. We will drop the word \"Gay\" and I think you can see why,' </p> <p>It will be a shame. Walking over the English Bridge and seeing Gay Meadow nestling between the Severn and the Abbey is to go back in time. To a time when G. Arthur Rowley was scoring 30 goals every season. </p>",

      "body": "<p> <strong> IT HAS COME</strong> to something when all that's left to get excited about in this Premiership season is a relegation contest between Bradford City and Wimbledon. Then again, perhaps it is only fitting that a celebration of mediocrity should attract so much attention at the fag end of such an anti-climactic campaign. Last weekend Manchester United confirmed a sixth Championship in eight seasons and proceeded to play out an exhibition match on Easter Monday against a Chelsea side who, like Leeds, had shot their bolt a month before the end of the season. Arsenal, meanwhile, have come good too late, in the league at least. At the top, that leaves Liverpool, who have admittedly come a long way under the astute G\u00e9rard Houllier. Only for him, among the managers of the bigger clubs chasing United, has big spending led to anything other than standing still, although it remains a mark of Anfield's decline amid Old Trafford's surge that they are delighted with a position still the length of the East Lancs Road behind. Both at home and abroad, this has been a season of fixture farce that the game's governing bodies, from the FA through Uefa to Fifa, need to address if the golden goose growing fat is not to become foie gras. The standardised calendar that has been mooted has surely become a matter of urgency. The Champions League ground on, too rich for even cash-conscious United's tastes. Here, the once-treasured FA Cup has been a shamefully fragmented afterthought even without the diverting controversy of United's withdrawal, so emasculated was it by wild cards and long gaps between rounds. If the FA are to reassert themselves as guardians of the game, they should start with their own competition. Alongside, the Premiership developed into a procession akin to Formula One - superficially glamorous but of muddy reality. It has served to prove that success at home and in Europe are increasingly incompatible, particularly on the Thursday-Sunday treadmill that the once-respected, now-marginalised Uefa Cup produces. Europe has yielded another unwanted repercussion for home consumption. Fans may still covet the title of their own country but it has seemed, in the Premiership at least, that managers settled too early for the goal of a top-three finish that admits them to the Champions League and appeases their accountants. Too often we heard the cop-out clause of aiming for that - rather than the title itself - from at least five managers. It may well have trickled down to players, enabling them to limit their horizons. Sir Alex Ferguson says this is United's best side in his 14 years in charge but he must have had trouble reaching that conclusion given the limpness of the domestic challenge. Indeed, after the title-clinching victory, the vanquished manager, Southampton's Glenn Hoddle, expressed his fears that England could turn into Scotland where Rangers dominate so dully. <strong> IT MAY SEEM </strong> laughable for a country that has prided itself on the depth of its competition, even though only eight clubs have won the title in the last 25 years, during which time Liverpool and United have claimed 15 championships. To dismiss the prospect is to ignore some worrying realities, however. Since the formation of the Premiership, it has become accepted that three tiers have developed - potential champions, Uefa Cup candidates and relegation fodder. Now, make that four with United in a league of their own. Yet this is a team whose defensive shortcomings were exposed in the World Club Championship and the quarter-final of the European Cup once, finally, it reached its knock-out stages. Is it really beyond the wit and invention of a club with money to get closer? And surely the nous of a good coach without money can still make a difference. One conclusion to be drawn, probably most glaringly at Chelsea, must be the need for a nucleus of English players in the Premiership, if not necessarily Europe. This is not to be xenophobic but practical. If fans are to be kept onside, they want to see players whom they believe will value the shirt. Having spent a season defending his expensive policies, Gianluca Vialli now seems ready to re-evaluate given the way some of his mercenaries and tourists have performed of late. This season, Chelsea were the first to field an all-overseas XI, some of whom have picked and chosen which domestic games they sit out. Fickle fans they may be, but some at Stamford Bridge have turned of late, feeling short-changed. Such an attitude could spread. The blend of half and half in which Ferguson believes and which has brought United success was something Ars\u00e9ne Wenger espoused on arrival in England when he sought to retain the culture of Arsenal. Houllier, for all his spending, has tried to follow the formula. The difficulties of retaining the home base increase as market forces intrude but it should remain a goal. Wenger himself may have noted that his side have slipped this season as more imports seek to gel and he has discarded English players. It holds true at the other end of the table, too, even if the spread of points difference these days bears testimony to bigger-than-ever gaps in quality. At Bradford, Paul Jewell has tried a few imports but they have not integrated. The vital victory at Sunderland last Sunday was achieved with some old home fires burning. At Wimbledon, meanwhile, Egil Olsen has damagingly introduced more Norwegians - and the fact that this country is such a haven for anonymous Scandinavians when they are in short supply in Italy and Spain says much about our pretensions - at the expense of an English cadre that has served the club so well. He is paying the penalty. It is ironic. There have been times when some of us would have liked to see Wimbledon relegated for some of the horrible physical injuries some of their number inflicted on opponents. Their football, too, was ugly, although it has to be said they did what they did very well, with the quality of the long ball paramount. Now, even if everything about them has been half-hearted of late, you almost want them to stay up. The Premiership chairmen are gradually getting the big-city league they originally envisaged, with the likes of Manchester City and Birmingham City threatening to return, and it would be good to see loose cannons surviving simply to subvert the unfolding predictable process. It is of course about money and for all our nostalgia at times, always has been. It is just that it wasn't always all about money. It seems that this season more than ever an even bigger chunk of the concept of competition has been eroded. Perhaps the prattle of wounded knee that has become the inflated Ruud Van Nistelrooy transfer saga is some symbolic warning to a game obsessed with huge sums but in danger of breaking down through overplaying. There will undoubtedly be another summer spending spree as Liverpool, Leeds and Arsenal especially, and possibly Chelsea, Aston Villa and Newcastle, expect themselves to bridge the gap.

      "body": "<p>The Football Association are set to take unprecedented action to tackle the growing number of referees quitting the game in disgust at suffering abuse, threats and violence. </p> <p>They will launch a campaign to halt an annual exodus of around 7,000 referees that is causing a serious shortage of officials at football's lower levels. Many who hang up their whistles are disillusioned at becoming targets of worsening indiscipline by players. </p> <p>Veteran referees will act as 'personal mentors' to referees who are just starting their careers and will guide them through the potential pitfalls of keeping order on the pitch. </p> <p>The FA are planning a high-profile advertising campaign, using newspapers, match-day programmes, libraries and town halls, to appeal for thousands of new referees. </p> <p>Top referees such as Premier League middleman Graham Poll - England's representative at Euro 2000 - will act as 'role models' to encourage volunteers. </p> <p>John Baker, of the FA's referees department, told The Observer: 'We train 7,500 new referees a year but the overall number of referees only rises by about 500 a year because 7,000 qualified officials decide to stop taking charge. We're paddling hard just to stay afloat. </p> <p>'About 20 per cent of Sunday games in some places don't have a referee. We clearly need to recruit more referees and, particularly, retain them for much longer by making them feel more valued and less stranded and giving them better back-up.' </p> <p>The campaign will begin in August and September. It will stress that people who love football can help the game by becoming referees, and that officiating is responsible, challenging and satisfying. </p> <p>People coming to the end of their playing career, and those already involved in running amateur or youth football, will be among groups targeted. The FA want more 18 to 25-year-olds volunteers to provide a new generation of referees. </p> <p>Under the mentoring scheme, newly qualified referees will receive special attention. Instructors will attend some of their first games to give advice, talk through problems and show them how to fill in a misconduct reports. After 10 games, groups of referees who trained together will meet up, swap experiences and discuss how to handle difficult moments. </p> <p>Baker said parents of youngsters playing games were almost as likely to be aggressive towards referees as adults in Sunday league football. He said more referees quit through 'natural wastage' than because they had been verbally or physically abused. </p> <p>Peter Willis, president of the 18,000-strong National Referees Association, welcomed 'any initiative by the FA that will help people take up refereeing.

      "bodyText": "The Football Association are set to take unprecedented action to tackle the growing number of referees quitting the game in disgust at suffering abuse, threats and violence. They will launch a campaign to halt an annual exodus of around 7,000 referees that is causing a serious shortage of officials at football's lower levels. Many who hang up their whistles are disillusioned at becoming targets of worsening indiscipline by players. Veteran referees will act as 'personal mentors' to referees who are just starting their careers and will guide them through the potential pitfalls of keeping order on the pitch. The FA are planning a high-profile advertising campaign, using newspapers, match-day programmes, libraries and town halls, to appeal for thousands of new referees. Top referees such as Premier League middleman Graham Poll - England's representative at Euro 2000 - will act as 'role models' to encourage volunteers. John Baker, of the FA's referees department, told The Observer: 'We train 7,500 new referees a year but the overall number of referees only rises by about 500 a year because 7,000 qualified officials decide to stop taking charge. We're paddling hard just to stay afloat. 'About 20 per cent of Sunday games in some places don't have a referee. We clearly need to recruit more referees and, particularly, retain them for much longer by making them feel more valued and less stranded and giving them better back-up.' The campaign will begin in August and September. It will stress that people who love football can help the game by becoming referees, and that officiating is responsible, challenging and satisfying. People coming to the end of their playing career, and those already involved in running amateur or youth football, will be among groups targeted. The FA want more 18 to 25-year-olds volunteers to provide a new generation of referees. Under the mentoring scheme, newly qualified referees will receive special attention. Instructors will attend some of their first games to give advice, talk through problems and show them how to fill in a misconduct reports. After 10 games, groups of referees who trained together will meet up, swap experiences and discuss how to handle difficult moments. Baker said parents of youngsters playing games were almost as likely to be aggressive towards referees as adults in Sunday league football. He said more referees quit through 'natural wastage' than because they had been verbally or physically abused. Peter Willis, president of the 18,000-strong National Referees Association, welcomed 'any initiative by the FA that will help people take up refereeing. This sounds brilliant'. Each of the 73 county FAs are appointing a recruitment and retention officer to stem the losses. Philip Don, the Premier League's referees officer, said that respect for referees had declined in recent years 'as has respect for teachers, police officers and anybody in authority.

      "body": "<p>If the Nasdaq catches a cold every time Microsoft sneezes, then stand by for a bad case of pneumonia. As the US judicial process moves inexorably towards a decision to break up Bill Gates's empire, all kinds of people are getting cold feet. Like those disgruntled Russian and East Germans who yearn for the old certainties of Stalinism, they wonder whether the world can cope with the terrifying freedoms which lie ahead. </p> <p>Consider the strange case of Louise Kehoe, the Financial Times 's Silicon Valley correspondent. Ms. Kehoe is a terrific journalist with wonderful contacts and robust common sense . At a time, for example, when most technology hacks are drooling about the prospects for WAP, she is one of the few who has taken the trouble to examine the technology critically - and to report objectively on its limitations. (She was not impressed.) </p> <p>It is a testimony to the power of Microsoft-fixation that not even Kehoe is immune to it. In her column last Wednesday she fell to worrying about what would happen to the millions of pathetic Windows and Office junkies when nasty ol' judge Jackson splits Microsoft into two companies - Windows Inc. and Office Inc. 'Bad enough,' she writes, 'to be bounced between the customer support departments of hardware and software companies. Will we in future have to determine whether a problem lies in the operating system or a software application before getting help?' </p> <p>There is a lot more in that vein. 'Perhaps Microsoft has abused its market power to enforce standards,' Kehoe burbles, 'but at least it did so efficiently.' All of which makes one wonder when was the last time she actually tried getting help from the current version of Microsoft. And does she know the famous joke about a helicopter which gets lost in fog and spots an office building through a gap in the mist? As it descends to seek assistance, workers in the building gather at the windows to watch. The pilot scrawls 'Help! Where Are We?' in large letters on a card and holds it against the cockpit window. 'In a helicopter,' the workers write back. 'Ah,' says the pilot, 'that's Microsoft. We must be in Redmond.' </p> <p>Neal Stephenson, the science-fiction novelist, has written a wonderful essay entitled <em> In the Beginning was the Command Line </em> which contains an hilarious account of his attempts to get help for a problem with Windows NT. The final straw for Stephenson was that when Microsoft finally accepted his description of the bug he had encountered, the company asserted that it then owned the copyright on his report! I need hardly add that Mr. Stephenson is now a keen Linux user. </p> <p>Another intriguing aspect of media coverage of Microsoft's woes is the sudden splurge of articles about Bill Gates's philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is now the largest charitable foundation in the history of the world. Its assets stand at $21.8 billion, which means that under US law it has to give away more than $1billion a year - no mean feat. So far, it has given (among other things) $850 million to vaccination programmes in poor countries and $550 million to schools and libraries. Just to put that in context: the New York Times estimates that, at current values, Andrew Carnegie gave away only $3 billion and John D. Rockefeller a paltry $6 billion. Gates's donations to the Foundation come in the form of quarterly bundles of Microsoft shares, which the trustees exchange for hard cash. It's nice to see people who know what they're doing. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">John.Naughton@observer.co.uk </a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/\">www.briefhistory.com/footnotes/</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "If the Nasdaq catches a cold every time Microsoft sneezes, then stand by for a bad case of pneumonia. As the US judicial process moves inexorably towards a decision to break up Bill Gates's empire, all kinds of people are getting cold feet. Like those disgruntled Russian and East Germans who yearn for the old certainties of Stalinism, they wonder whether the world can cope with the terrifying freedoms which lie ahead. Consider the strange case of Louise Kehoe, the Financial Times 's Silicon Valley correspondent. Ms. Kehoe is a terrific journalist with wonderful contacts and robust common sense . At a time, for example, when most technology hacks are drooling about the prospects for WAP, she is one of the few who has taken the trouble to examine the technology critically - and to report objectively on its limitations. (She was not impressed.) It is a testimony to the power of Microsoft-fixation that not even Kehoe is immune to it. In her column last Wednesday she fell to worrying about what would happen to the millions of pathetic Windows and Office junkies when nasty ol' judge Jackson splits Microsoft into two companies - Windows Inc. and Office Inc. 'Bad enough,' she writes, 'to be bounced between the customer support departments of hardware and software companies. Will we in future have to determine whether a problem lies in the operating system or a software application before getting help?' There is a lot more in that vein. 'Perhaps Microsoft has abused its market power to enforce standards,' Kehoe burbles, 'but at least it did so efficiently.' All of which makes one wonder when was the last time she actually tried getting help from the current version of Microsoft. And does she know the famous joke about a helicopter which gets lost in fog and spots an office building through a gap in the mist? As it descends to seek assistance, workers in the building gather at the windows to watch. The pilot scrawls 'Help! Where Are We?' in large letters on a card and holds it against the cockpit window. 'In a helicopter,' the workers write back. 'Ah,' says the pilot, 'that's Microsoft. We must be in Redmond.' Neal Stephenson, the science-fiction novelist, has written a wonderful essay entitled In the Beginning was the Command Line which contains an hilarious account of his attempts to get help for a problem with Windows NT. The final straw for Stephenson was that when Microsoft finally accepted his description of the bug he had encountered, the company asserted that it then owned the copyright on his report! I need hardly add that Mr. Stephenson is now a keen Linux user. Another intriguing aspect of media coverage of Microsoft's woes is the sudden splurge of articles about Bill Gates's philanthropy. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is now the largest charitable foundation in the history of the world. Its assets stand at $21.8 billion, which means that under US law it has to give away more than $1billion a year - no mean feat. So far, it has given (among other things) $850 million to vaccination programmes in poor countries and $550 million to schools and libraries. Just to put that in context: the New York Times estimates that, at current values, Andrew Carnegie gave away only $3 billion and John D. Rockefeller a paltry $6 billion. Gates's donations to the Foundation come in the form of quarterly bundles of Microsoft shares, which the trustees exchange for hard cash. It's nice to see people who know what they're doing.

The last facelift late last year did not do the business; it is losing out to more exciting rivals, such as the Peugeot 206, Renault Clio and Fiat Punto. Ford's market share is appalling across Europe.' </p> <p>This slump is partly the result of declining Fiesta sales but also caused by poor sales of the Mondeo, due to be replaced this autumn. Ford made just \u00a317 million profits in Europe last year on an \u00a318 billion turnover, with profit margins on car sales of just 0.1 per cent. This contrasts sharply with Ford's record global profits of \u00a34.5bn. </p> <p>The Galaxy people-carrier, sporty Puma and tiny Ka are doing well in Europe but are sidelines in comparison with Ford's three mass-market models, the Mondeo, Focus and Fiesta. </p> <p>The Focus, which replaced the Escort, is doing well but Ford chiefs admit that the fortunes of a huge business cannot rely on one model alone. </p> <p>Despite being the second largest carmaker in the world, after General Motors, Ford is only the fourth bestseller in a western European car market of 16 million a year. It was brand leader in Europe in 1997 with 11 per cent. But Volkswagen overtook Ford in 1998 and has stayed at the top ever since. In the first quarter of this year, the Ford brand (excluding other badges in the group such as Volvo and Jaguar) commanded only 8.7 per cent of the European market, behind VW, Renault and Vauxhall/Opel, which each have more than 10 per cent. </p> <p>Like all manufacturers with plants in the UK, Ford has a difficulty with the strength of the pound against the euro. But across Europe it has a wider sales problem and too much factory capacity. </p> <p>Griffiths said: 'As far as they are concerned they are haemorrhaging in Europe. It is not just that they are not making money but they have not had much return on their European investments and they want to do something about that.' </p> <p>The problems have prompted Ford to conduct a root-and-branch review of its European operations and Dagenham is under the spotlight. Griffiths said: 'If there is a big change at Dagenham, then that will involve more radical change at other European plants as well.' But that could involve other factories gaining additional models whereas Dagenham is particularly vulnerable to the opposite fate. </p> <p>Not only is the Fiesta selling badly on the Continent but there has been a 'consumer strike' in the UK over high British prices. </p> <p>The factory has improved efficiency enormously in the last 10 years but is still not as productive as other European plants - it takes 25 per cent longer to build a Fiesta in Dagenham than in Cologne. And, although workers cost less to employ in the UK than on the Continent, which is an advantage, they can be sacked for around half the cost of a German or Belgian worker. </p> <p>Then there is a local issue of working practices at Dagenham. Huge strides have been made at the plant to improve productivity and modernise industrial and employee relations during the Nineties. But it is still behind the times. There have been high-profile rows over racism at the plant, shopfloor disputes, problems with absenteeism and hiccups in the supply of components. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the strength of the pound against the euro causes problems beyond the workforce's control. And the flexible labour laws that helped attract companies to invest here in the first place make it cheaper for them to leave when they need to make cutbacks. </p> <p>Joe Dickinson, of consultants AT Kearney, said: 'You have got to admit that the cost of closing plants in the UK is a lot lower than in Germany or Belgium. It is not a common market in Europe in the sense of labour laws.' </p> <p>Ford opened its factories in the UK half a century before the Thatcherite policies of union-breaking and flexible labour brought Far Eastern manufacturers flocking, but it is now in the centre of the debate about how easy it is to ditch thousands of British workers and, indeed, an entire plant if that is what the rigours of the market demand. </p> <p>Ford has already cut out one factory from the brand when it denied the Focus to its Halewood plant on Merseyside in 1998 and, instead, decided to replace production of the Escort with the forthcoming small Jaguar. </p> <p>But now it wants to cut more capacity and again looks to Britain. One industry observer last week predicted that the new Fiesta would be built first at Cologne and then, if more were needed, at Ford's plant in Valencia, Spain - deep in euroland. </p> <p>That would be the final insult for the redundant Dagenham workforce.

      "body": "<p>It's as if the country can't and won't confront the truth. Over the last three months, the heart has begun to be ripped out of our industrial and commercial centres as a result of one of the most stunning periods of currency overvaluation ever. Longbridge's future now hangs by a thread; Dagenham's closure is nearly certain. Many more shocks are in the pipeline. Yet the principal cause of all this remains largely undiscussed. </p> <p>Sterling has climbed to levels that rival the uncompetitiveness following Britain's return to the Gold Standard in 1925 or the first years of Mrs Thatcher's governments in the early 1980s. But because it is impossible to report or discuss this phenomenon without taking a position on whether we should join the euro, Britain has almost imposed a self-denying ordinance upon itself. </p> <p>Compared with the outcry following Churchill's decision in the Twenties or the passionate denunciation of Thatcher and Howe in the Eighties, the Government has been allowed to get away almost scot-free from the economic and social consequences of its exchange-rate policy. An eerie silence reigns. BMW and Ford can explain that the chief reason that volume car production is no longer possible at Longbridge or Dagenham is because the exchange rate makes it hopeless, but there is little or no political resonance. </p> <p>Yet the carnage extends well beyond the car industry. Britain's trade surplus in pharmaceuticals in 1999 had its biggest percentage fall since 1945 - and this in one of our last internationally competitive industries. Exports may have risen some 7 per cent, but imports have jumped 24 per cent. With the pound now even higher, this year the trends will be much worse. </p> <p>Part of the reason for only localised anger is that while the CBI's recent survey of business confidence warns that a recession in manufacturing is imminent, manufacturing only constitutes a quarter of GDP and a fifth of employment. Unemployment generally is still falling, benefiting from the momentum of nearly eight years of sustained economic growth. Perhaps the vigour of the service sector will mask the crisis hitting manufacturing. </p> <p>But the service sector trades internationally as well. Tourism, for example, is just as exchange-rate dependent. Day trips from France on Eurostar are down this year by 9 per cent; overall, the number of tourists visiting Britain in January and February grew by just 2 per cent - the lowest growth rate for more than 10 years. The same trends are evident across the board - the inflow of overseas students, the capacity to underwrite international insurance business, sales of music, etc. The idea that the service sector is insulated from the crazy valuation of the pound is wrong; the discomfort will soon become generalised. </p> <p>Another important reason for the silence is that the launch of the euro has made it harder to understand just how high the pound has risen. The fall in the euro is reported joyfully by a broadly Eurosceptic press, but what is omitted is that translating the euro/sterling rate into its equivalent Deutschmark rate means that the pound now buys DM3.36. That is 20 per cent above the DM2.78 rate at which sterling crashed out of the ERM in 1992 because it was overvalued. </p> <p>And this, of course, is the single biggest reason for the silence over the exchange rate. The launch of the euro is the central reason for the pound's overvaluation. The world now has two giant currencies - the dollar and the euro - and one very large currency - the yen. The scale of untrammelled, speculative flows between these currency blocs is awesome, changing the dynamics of exchange-rate determination forever. 'Baby' currencies such as sterling are squeezed between the new giant currency blocs so that their movements are even more volatile than before; they are carried higher or lower for longer. The choice is stark. We throw in our lot with the Europeans or we learn to live with extreme currency overvaluation. We have no 'sovereignty' whatsoever. </p> <p>This has been true for the last 16 months, but there has a massive lacuna in political debate. The Tories cannot attack the Government because they are so anti-euro that they don't have a single coherent idea to offer on how the pound can be lowered. New Labour, emerging as the most timid administration since the war, refuses to champion the euro or even acknowledge that membership of the euro might have taken some of the pressure off the car industry. </p> <p>Brown's and Blair's blanket veto extends even to the all-party pressure group, Britain in Europe, so that it can not even talk about the issue it was established to fight for! The Eurosceptic press hardly helps; Daily Mail readers would have needed to be sleuths to have learned that Nissan's announcement 10 days ago of 5,000 potential job losses was accompanied by a plea to join the euro. </p> <p>Nissan is not alone.

      "bodyText": "It's as if the country can't and won't confront the truth. Over the last three months, the heart has begun to be ripped out of our industrial and commercial centres as a result of one of the most stunning periods of currency overvaluation ever. Longbridge's future now hangs by a thread; Dagenham's closure is nearly certain. Many more shocks are in the pipeline. Yet the principal cause of all this remains largely undiscussed. Sterling has climbed to levels that rival the uncompetitiveness following Britain's return to the Gold Standard in 1925 or the first years of Mrs Thatcher's governments in the early 1980s. But because it is impossible to report or discuss this phenomenon without taking a position on whether we should join the euro, Britain has almost imposed a self-denying ordinance upon itself. Compared with the outcry following Churchill's decision in the Twenties or the passionate denunciation of Thatcher and Howe in the Eighties, the Government has been allowed to get away almost scot-free from the economic and social consequences of its exchange-rate policy. An eerie silence reigns. BMW and Ford can explain that the chief reason that volume car production is no longer possible at Longbridge or Dagenham is because the exchange rate makes it hopeless, but there is little or no political resonance. Yet the carnage extends well beyond the car industry. Britain's trade surplus in pharmaceuticals in 1999 had its biggest percentage fall since 1945 - and this in one of our last internationally competitive industries. Exports may have risen some 7 per cent, but imports have jumped 24 per cent. With the pound now even higher, this year the trends will be much worse. Part of the reason for only localised anger is that while the CBI's recent survey of business confidence warns that a recession in manufacturing is imminent, manufacturing only constitutes a quarter of GDP and a fifth of employment. Unemployment generally is still falling, benefiting from the momentum of nearly eight years of sustained economic growth. Perhaps the vigour of the service sector will mask the crisis hitting manufacturing. But the service sector trades internationally as well. Tourism, for example, is just as exchange-rate dependent. Day trips from France on Eurostar are down this year by 9 per cent; overall, the number of tourists visiting Britain in January and February grew by just 2 per cent - the lowest growth rate for more than 10 years. The same trends are evident across the board - the inflow of overseas students, the capacity to underwrite international insurance business, sales of music, etc. The idea that the service sector is insulated from the crazy valuation of the pound is wrong; the discomfort will soon become generalised. Another important reason for the silence is that the launch of the euro has made it harder to understand just how high the pound has risen. The fall in the euro is reported joyfully by a broadly Eurosceptic press, but what is omitted is that translating the euro/sterling rate into its equivalent Deutschmark rate means that the pound now buys DM3.36. That is 20 per cent above the DM2.78 rate at which sterling crashed out of the ERM in 1992 because it was overvalued. And this, of course, is the single biggest reason for the silence over the exchange rate. The launch of the euro is the central reason for the pound's overvaluation. The world now has two giant currencies - the dollar and the euro - and one very large currency - the yen. The scale of untrammelled, speculative flows between these currency blocs is awesome, changing the dynamics of exchange-rate determination forever. 'Baby' currencies such as sterling are squeezed between the new giant currency blocs so that their movements are even more volatile than before; they are carried higher or lower for longer. The choice is stark. We throw in our lot with the Europeans or we learn to live with extreme currency overvaluation. We have no 'sovereignty' whatsoever. This has been true for the last 16 months, but there has a massive lacuna in political debate. The Tories cannot attack the Government because they are so anti-euro that they don't have a single coherent idea to offer on how the pound can be lowered. New Labour, emerging as the most timid administration since the war, refuses to champion the euro or even acknowledge that membership of the euro might have taken some of the pressure off the car industry. Brown's and Blair's blanket veto extends even to the all-party pressure group, Britain in Europe, so that it can not even talk about the issue it was established to fight for! The Eurosceptic press hardly helps; Daily Mail readers would have needed to be sleuths to have learned that Nissan's announcement 10 days ago of 5,000 potential job losses was accompanied by a plea to join the euro. Nissan is not alone. The entire car industry says the same, as does every inward investor. Yet the Government finds itself adopting the same free-market mantra as the early Thatcherites. I remem ber interviewing Leon Brittan in 1982 when, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury, he insisted that there was nothing that could be done about the high pound; no commitment to join the ERM; no intervention; no change in interest-rate policy; no declaration of intent to lower it; no nothing.

      "body": "<p>Cooking is too often about simply getting something on the table. The pasta sauce I can make in the nine minutes it takes for the penne to become al dente; the chops I just about have time to grill in the moments between my arrival home and everyone else's; the supermarket-made vegetable bake that takes exactly the same amount of time in the oven as it takes me to have a bath and get ready to watch ER . Too often what I cook is decided by the time I have available or the amount of energy I have left at the end of the day. But sometimes, just sometimes, I want to cook for the sheer pleasure of it. </p> <p>And there is pleasure. The satisfaction of watching mushrooms turn from white to gold in sizzling butter; the feel of soft fresh pasta between your fingers; the sensation of meticulously rubbing the sandy, papery skins off new potatoes; the smell of a cake as it rises in your oven or witnessing mayonnaise slowly thicken as you beat it, patiently, adding the oil drop by tiny drop, the way we are told to by those writers who would rather die than buy a tube of ready-made. </p> <p>Germaine Greer said recently how much she prefers cooking 'the hard way': 'I wanted the release of concentrating on each process and the physicality of the contact with the fruit, even if the stinging juice under my torn thumbnail brought tears to my eyes.' I know what she means and I agree, and it is too bad that I don't always allow myself the time to cook like this. Saving a few minutes or getting supper ready in time to watch our favourite soap has become so crucial that one can sometimes forget there is probably more pleasure in watching a meal slowly come together than there could ever be in even your favourite movie. That is why books are better, I suppose. They at least wait for us to finish cooking. </p> <p>Unless you have devoted your life to keeping home, your weekday eating will inevitably be a hotch-potch of short cuts and cop outs. Mine certainly is, though I do take the time to smell and taste, to poke and stroke. I can't even peel a banana without taking a quick sniff. But these are stolen moments. I somehow want the pleasure of eating to outlast the pleasure of preparation, but it's as if you can't relax until you are sitting down with your meal in front of you. </p> <p>The clever thing, and perhaps the most life-enriching, would be to relax as soon as we take our coats off and start to cook rather than when we sit down at the table. But hunger (or what we perceive as hunger) sometimes gets in the way. Sod the joy of sniffing and stirring. We want our supper Now. </p> <p>And yet time in the kitchen can be just as therapeutic and as satisfying as time spent at the table. The other day, rain coming down in sheets (and another excuse not to get started on the garden), I spent an entire morning making one dish for supper. I let a white sauce bubble slowly so that the floury taste would completely cook out, and for once I remembered to put in the bay leaves and stud the onion with cloves and finish the sauce with cream. I soaked dried porcini till they plumped up like slices of sponge to add depth and earthy savour to a sauce of cultivated mushrooms. I pounded basil with pinenuts and pecorino by hand to make a sweet pesto (pure aromatherapy, even with understated spring basil). The only easy way out I took was dodging the raindrops to get some sheets of silky, hand-made lasagne from Mr Rocco up the road. And anyway this wasn't cheating: his pasta is the best I have ever eaten and makes my home-made version look and eat like a duvet. </p> <p>Perhaps you think I should cook this multi-layered food every day. Well, I don't. It is not simply that I feel there is more to life than standing at the stove but, over the years, I have found that if you buy really good ingredients, then you rarely have to do much to them in order to eat them at their best. I have never really understood the point of complicated recipes and, to my taste, the result is rarely worth the trouble. But the trouble taken can, I suppose, be a good enough reason for cooking a recipe if it gives you pleasure. The physical act of cooking, of peeling and chopping, of simmering and sieving, can be pure joy if you have nothing else in particular to do. </p> <p>With no one screaming for their supper, you can potter about doing things 'the hard way'. With the soporific burbling of the radio in the background and the cat patiently watching your every move, you can vent your anger, calm your nerves, unruffle your feathers. You can fill your kitchen with the smell of baking, fondle every vegetable, sieve every sauce, skin every broad bean. And then you can eat. </p> <p><strong> Lentil moussaka with mint and harissa</strong><br> </p> <p> Serves 6 </p> <p>250g green or brown lentils </p> <p>olive oil </p> <p>2 medium-sized aubergines </p> <p>3 medium-sized onions </p> <p>2 plump, juicy cloves of garlic </p> <p>1 tsp cumin seeds </p> <p>5 tomatoes </p> <p>500ml tomato passata </p> <p>the leaves from a small bunch of mint </p> <p>1 heaped tsp (or maybe a little more) harissa paste </p> <p>500ml bechamel sauce </p> <p>Rinse the lentils in a sieve under running water and then boil them in deep water until they are tender. This will take about 20 minutes, depending on the type, size and age of your lentils. </p> <p>Meanwhile, warm a thin layer of olive oil in a casserole, thinly slice the aubergines lengthways (you will need about 12 slices), fry them, a few at a time, till golden on each side, then remove them and put them to one side. Peel and roughly chop the onions, then cook them in a little olive oil in the same casserole till they start to soften, then add the garlic and the cumin seeds and continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes over a moderate heat till all is soft and fragrant. </p> <p>Put a small slit in the top of each tomato and then put them in a deep bowl and pour a kettle of boiling water over them. Leave them for a couple of minutes then lift each one out with a draining spoon and peel away the skin. Chop the tomatoes roughly and add them to the onions, then let them soften a while before pouring in the passata. </p> <p>Bring the onion and tomato sauce to the boil, adding the harissa, drained lentils and torn-up mint leaves.

      "bodyText": "Cooking is too often about simply getting something on the table. The pasta sauce I can make in the nine minutes it takes for the penne to become al dente; the chops I just about have time to grill in the moments between my arrival home and everyone else's; the supermarket-made vegetable bake that takes exactly the same amount of time in the oven as it takes me to have a bath and get ready to watch ER . Too often what I cook is decided by the time I have available or the amount of energy I have left at the end of the day. But sometimes, just sometimes, I want to cook for the sheer pleasure of it. And there is pleasure. The satisfaction of watching mushrooms turn from white to gold in sizzling butter; the feel of soft fresh pasta between your fingers; the sensation of meticulously rubbing the sandy, papery skins off new potatoes; the smell of a cake as it rises in your oven or witnessing mayonnaise slowly thicken as you beat it, patiently, adding the oil drop by tiny drop, the way we are told to by those writers who would rather die than buy a tube of ready-made. Germaine Greer said recently how much she prefers cooking 'the hard way': 'I wanted the release of concentrating on each process and the physicality of the contact with the fruit, even if the stinging juice under my torn thumbnail brought tears to my eyes.' I know what she means and I agree, and it is too bad that I don't always allow myself the time to cook like this. Saving a few minutes or getting supper ready in time to watch our favourite soap has become so crucial that one can sometimes forget there is probably more pleasure in watching a meal slowly come together than there could ever be in even your favourite movie. That is why books are better, I suppose. They at least wait for us to finish cooking. Unless you have devoted your life to keeping home, your weekday eating will inevitably be a hotch-potch of short cuts and cop outs. Mine certainly is, though I do take the time to smell and taste, to poke and stroke. I can't even peel a banana without taking a quick sniff. But these are stolen moments. I somehow want the pleasure of eating to outlast the pleasure of preparation, but it's as if you can't relax until you are sitting down with your meal in front of you. The clever thing, and perhaps the most life-enriching, would be to relax as soon as we take our coats off and start to cook rather than when we sit down at the table. But hunger (or what we perceive as hunger) sometimes gets in the way. Sod the joy of sniffing and stirring. We want our supper Now. And yet time in the kitchen can be just as therapeutic and as satisfying as time spent at the table. The other day, rain coming down in sheets (and another excuse not to get started on the garden), I spent an entire morning making one dish for supper. I let a white sauce bubble slowly so that the floury taste would completely cook out, and for once I remembered to put in the bay leaves and stud the onion with cloves and finish the sauce with cream. I soaked dried porcini till they plumped up like slices of sponge to add depth and earthy savour to a sauce of cultivated mushrooms. I pounded basil with pinenuts and pecorino by hand to make a sweet pesto (pure aromatherapy, even with understated spring basil). The only easy way out I took was dodging the raindrops to get some sheets of silky, hand-made lasagne from Mr Rocco up the road. And anyway this wasn't cheating: his pasta is the best I have ever eaten and makes my home-made version look and eat like a duvet. Perhaps you think I should cook this multi-layered food every day. Well, I don't. It is not simply that I feel there is more to life than standing at the stove but, over the years, I have found that if you buy really good ingredients, then you rarely have to do much to them in order to eat them at their best. I have never really understood the point of complicated recipes and, to my taste, the result is rarely worth the trouble. But the trouble taken can, I suppose, be a good enough reason for cooking a recipe if it gives you pleasure. The physical act of cooking, of peeling and chopping, of simmering and sieving, can be pure joy if you have nothing else in particular to do. With no one screaming for their supper, you can potter about doing things 'the hard way'. With the soporific burbling of the radio in the background and the cat patiently watching your every move, you can vent your anger, calm your nerves, unruffle your feathers. You can fill your kitchen with the smell of baking, fondle every vegetable, sieve every sauce, skin every broad bean. And then you can eat. Lentil moussaka with mint and harissa Serves 6 250g green or brown lentils olive oil 2 medium-sized aubergines 3 medium-sized onions 2 plump, juicy cloves of garlic 1 tsp cumin seeds 5 tomatoes 500ml tomato passata the leaves from a small bunch of mint 1 heaped tsp (or maybe a little more) harissa paste 500ml bechamel sauce Rinse the lentils in a sieve under running water and then boil them in deep water until they are tender. This will take about 20 minutes, depending on the type, size and age of your lentils. Meanwhile, warm a thin layer of olive oil in a casserole, thinly slice the aubergines lengthways (you will need about 12 slices), fry them, a few at a time, till golden on each side, then remove them and put them to one side. Peel and roughly chop the onions, then cook them in a little olive oil in the same casserole till they start to soften, then add the garlic and the cumin seeds and continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes over a moderate heat till all is soft and fragrant. Put a small slit in the top of each tomato and then put them in a deep bowl and pour a kettle of boiling water over them. Leave them for a couple of minutes then lift each one out with a draining spoon and peel away the skin. Chop the tomatoes roughly and add them to the onions, then let them soften a while before pouring in the passata. Bring the onion and tomato sauce to the boil, adding the harissa, drained lentils and torn-up mint leaves. Taste for seasoning - you will need salt and black pepper - then turn down the heat so that the lentils simmer gently for 10 minutes. Lay the aubergines in a 32cm baking dish and cover with the lentil sauce. Lay the remaining aubergine slices on top and cover with the bechamel sauce. Bake for 50 minutes at 180 C/gas mark 4 or until bubbling. Mushroom lasagne with basil and cream Serves 6 2 onions 4 large, juicy cloves of garlic a thick slice of butter 10g packet dried porcini 750g mushrooms a good handful of chopped parsley leaves 150ml cream 4 or 5 tbsps freshly grated Parmesan, plus 3 more for later 750ml bechamel sauce 450g of fresh lasagne for the basil sauce 60g pine kernels 50g basil leaves 2 cloves of garlic, peeled enough olive oil to make a thick, spoonable paste 4 tbsps freshly grated Parmesan Peel and roughly chop the onions, peel and thinly slice the garlic and then set them to cook in a deep-sided frying pan with a thick slice of butter. Cover the dried porcini with warm water - barely 100ml - and leave to soak. After 20 minutes, the onions and garlic will have softened and taken on an almost translucent quality. Meanwhile, cut the fresh mushrooms into thick slices. To make the basil sauce, either blitz the pine kernels, basil, garlic, olive oil and Parmesan in a food processor, or do it the hard way by pounding the garlic with a little salt in a mortar, then mashing in the basil, pine kernels and olive oil to make a rough and slightly sloppy paste. Stir the sliced mushrooms into the onions and garlic and partially cover with a lid. The mushrooms should colour and soften. Add the reconstituted porcini and their soaking water, then the parsley, 4 or 5 tablespoons of Parmesan and the cream. Season with salt and pepper and simmer and stir until the cream has thickened. Spread a few spoonfuls of the bechamel sauce on the bottom of a large dish (I used a 40cm oval baking dish) then cover with a layer of the pasta. Spoon on half the mushroom filling, cover with another layer of pasta, a second layer of mushrooms and cream, and top with a third single layer of pasta. Spread the basil sauce over the pasta, then smooth the remaining bechamel sauce over and cover with the remaining Parmesan. Bake at 180 C/ gas mark 4 for 50 minutes or until golden and bubbling.",

      "body": "<p>On the day we meet, Ken Livingstone is in the headlines again, this time for comparing deaths as a result of international capitalism to those under Hitler's rule in Germany. He stops talking to listen to the radio news in the caf\u00e9 near his borrowed campaign offices off Oxford Street. It is a mixture of condemnations from business leaders and members of the Jewish community. Livingstone shrugs. Just politics as usual, and it doesn't appear to be having any impact on his poll lead.</p> <p>'After two years campaigning for this job,' he later says, 'there's nothing new. There are no new questions. Unless you go and give a talk at a school. Then you get new questions. Kids always come up with something new.' Such long experience of providing the answers should, then, have proved ideal training for our five questions for the candidates for Mayor of London.</p> <p><b> Are you going to take regeneration in east London seriously?</b></p> <p>After a long diagnosis of the problem - the death of the London docks, failure of investment, mismanagement of government subsidy - Livingstone finally turns to the cure. For the first time, but certainly not the last, he draws on his experience as leader of the Greater London Council during the Eighties. 'We found at the GLC that if you give people a second chance to get an education they will jump at it,' he says. 'I think you've got to have a drive like that. The key lies in training and then bringing them into employment. You've got to get these people into the pattern of work.'</p> <p>The problem is, he says, that the private sector is not geared up for the in-work training that such a policy entails. 'But local government, the health service and the voluntary sector does have the capacity to employ people and they need to be given money to do it.' Once people have these skills they can then swap into the private sector, he says. He also wants to see a new programme of council house building. Money for both schemes would come from the \u00a3284 million of Strategic Regeneration Grants the Mayor has at his disposal.</p> <p><b> How will you make Londoners happier and therefore healthier?</b></p> <p>'On the day of the Budget London's hospitals had a collective deficit of \u00a3100m and some of them were technically bankrupt,' he says. 'The Budget gave \u00a3106m but unless you increase the baseline funding the deficits will just return.' He sets off on a long speech about the underfunding of the health service, London's failure to receive a proportionate cut of the health spending budget and calls on voters to 'name and shame governments that discriminate against Londoners'.</p> <p>This is all very entertaining but has nothing to do with the job to which Livingstone hopes to be elected this week. The mayor will have no responsibility for primary health care services, the funding of which remains with the various trusts. When this is pointed out to him the candidate instead talks up his congestion charging policy which, he says, 'would reduce pollution. We also need to beautify the city. Some streets have no trees and on hot summer days the temperature will be much lower if they had trees. Also I will encourage people to get out and walk more in London. One of the nicest things you can do in London on a Sunday is have lunch by the river and go for a walk.'</p> <p>Despite repeated prompting he did not, at any point, raise poor housing, low pay and unemployment, the issues broadly regarded as having the greatest impact on public health. Clearly Livingstone does not think that addressing these problems is a public health issue - as the other three main candidates all do. Or, if he does, he is not inclined to say so.</p> <p><b> How will you make the lives of Londoners more beautiful?</b></p> <p>The key here, he says, is proper use of London's parks. Once again, an opportunity for GLC references: 'What people remember from the GLC is the various concerts we staged. A quarter of a million Londoners coming together. And the gardening exhibitions.' That, he says, will return. In addition he will do something about the under-use of London's facilities by cutting the costs. 'An awful lot of Londoners can't afford to use the facilities. To get into the cinema or the theatre can cost far too much. And charging for museums has turned away more Londoners than tourists. We're going to introduce a Capital Card which will provide cheap entrance to places on Wednesday afternoons.'</p> <p>Where will the money for all this come from? The \u00a33.3 billion budget under the control of the Greater London Authority is merely money already being spent in London. 'We have an arts budget,' he says, simply. 'At the moment it's minuscule, \u00a316m. It will have to increase. By the last day I want it to be \u00a3160m.' 'Orinoco Flow' by Enya comes on the radio. Livingstone stops again. 'We'll have a concert and we'll get Enya there,' he says. This may or may not be a vote winner.</p> <p><b> How will you get London moving?</b></p> <p>Livingstone dismisses claims by other candidates that a paper-based - as against electronic - congestion charging system is unworkable. 'We can't wait for an electronic system to be ready. There may be some evasion of the charge under a paper-based system but the vast majority of people are honest.' As to the congestion charge he favours the proposal put forward by London First, the business development group: \u00a35 a day for a small area of central London. 'But I will put it out to consultation.'</p> <p>He also wants to use bonds to fund regeneration of the Tube, cut fares (as he did at the GLC), get conductors back on buses and clean them up. He accepts that all this will cost. 'You've got to get more money,' he says, eventually. 'You can't solve London's problems without it.'</p> <p>So where will this cash come from? Finally we get to the heart of Livingstone's policy. He does not believe the \u00a33.3bn budget he will have to work with is enough. 'London gives far more in taxes than it receives,' he says. 'It's no good just bleeding London dry. The Mayor's going to lead the campaign to get extra money. The Government is currently thinking of cutting money spent in London by \u00a3800m. That will actually make the situation worse. The Mayor needs to have a bare knuckle fight to stop that happening.'</p> <p>Is he really the candidate best placed to get money out of a Government that so clearly dislikes him? 'Politicians respect strength,' he says. 'If you make their life more difficult they'll pay you more respect.' He says Tony Blair and Gordon Brown will be scared of him.</p> <p><b> How will you make London safer?</b></p> <p>During the Eighties, Livingstone says, there were 28,000 police officers in London serving 6.5 million people. Now there are 26,000 serving 7 million. 'There aren't the police officers to get the job done. We need to get back to the 28,000 level. And you've got to pay them more. The cost of living in London is 26 per cent higher than elsewhere. Police officers want a rise of \u00a35,000 and they ought to get it.'</p> <p>Does this mean, once again, banging on Gordon Brown's door to get the cash. 'Yup. It means banging on Gordon's door. Unless you can persuade police officers to work for nothing.' He also wants an audit of police resources to see where they are spending their money and he wants more officers on bicycles. As to morale within the Metropolitan police: 'I'd fight to support their pay demands. I'd support all public sector workers.'</p> <p>It is hard to escape the impression that Ken Livingstone is campaigning to do a different job than that advertised: one with far greater powers and far more money to spend. I ask him if he is disappointed by the way the position has been framed. 'Come back in 25 years time and I suspect it will be much more like the job of Mayor of New York,' he says.</p> <p>'The London Mayor will run health, schools, everything. And we'll be the model for regional government in Britain.' And will he be its Mayor then? He shakes his head. 'I suspect a city like London changes so rapidly it burns up its politicians. I'll be lucky to get a second term.' He hesitates. 'Maybe I'll be lucky to get a first.' It is the one thing he says without any conviction whatsoever.</p> <p><b>What the candidates stand for </b></p> <p><b> Frank Dobson</b></p> <p><b>Transport </b></p> <p>No to congestion charging at least for first four years.

During the Eighties, Livingstone says, there were 28,000 police officers in London serving 6.5 million people. Now there are 26,000 serving 7 million. 'There aren't the police officers to get the job done. We need to get back to the 28,000 level. And you've got to pay them more. The cost of living in London is 26 per cent higher than elsewhere. Police officers want a rise of \u00a35,000 and they ought to get it.' Does this mean, once again, banging on Gordon Brown's door to get the cash. 'Yup. It means banging on Gordon's door. Unless you can persuade police officers to work for nothing.' He also wants an audit of police resources to see where they are spending their money and he wants more officers on bicycles. As to morale within the Metropolitan police: 'I'd fight to support their pay demands. I'd support all public sector workers.' It is hard to escape the impression that Ken Livingstone is campaigning to do a different job than that advertised: one with far greater powers and far more money to spend. I ask him if he is disappointed by the way the position has been framed. 'Come back in 25 years time and I suspect it will be much more like the job of Mayor of New York,' he says. 'The London Mayor will run health, schools, everything. And we'll be the model for regional government in Britain.' And will he be its Mayor then? He shakes his head. 'I suspect a city like London changes so rapidly it burns up its politicians. I'll be lucky to get a second term.' He hesitates. 'Maybe I'll be lucky to get a first.' It is the one thing he says without any conviction whatsoever. What the candidates stand for Frank Dobson Transport No to congestion charging at least for first four years. Funding of Tube regeneration by Public Private Partnership. Crime Will bring back police housing allowance to aid recruitment. Public Health A Chief Medical Officer and affordable social housing. Life of the city Will plant 100,000 trees. Wants parks areas that are for adults accompanied by children only. Economy Committed to creating 100,000 new jobs. Will work to get more cash out of Europe for London. Big Idea Vote for me because I've been in the Cabinet and have a better relationship with the Treasury Ken Livingstone Transport Wants congestion charging as soon as possible and wants to fund the Tube through bonds. Crime Wants the Government to cough up more money for police pay. Public Health Wants more money for hospitals even though it's not in the mayor's remit. Believes Londoners should take more walks. Life of the city Wants to stage more concerts in London's parks. Will book Enya to appear. Economy Will get the unemployed into jobs in the public and voluntary sector. Wants more government cash. Big Idea Vote for me and I'll demand more money from the Government. Steve Norris Transport Rejects congestion charging and believes some Public Private Partnership is way to fund Tube.

Will demand more government money for NHS. Life of the city Will appoint commissioners for public spaces and architecture. Economy Wants to target regeneration grants at skills training. Big Idea Vote for me and I'll get things done, even if I have to dump Conservative Party policy to do it. Susan Kramer Transport Congestion charging, probably \u00a35 per day for central London. Believes in bonds to fund the tube. Crime Wants a Community Constabulary uniting park keepers, traffic wardens, caretakers to curb anti-social behaviour. Higher police pay. Public Health Will appoint a Chief Medical Officer to audit resources. Life of the city Wants 100,000 new affordable homes, paid for by investment from new community banks. Economy Wants to set up community banks to invest in specific local areas. Big Idea Vote for me because I'm a banker and I know about raising money.",

      "body": "<p>I travelled back from Scotland last Saturday night having spent a week taking part in the restoration of a Thomas Mawson garden near Crieff. This involves landscaping on a heroic scale in a heroic setting and, on the plane, I allowed myself to cherry-pick the perfect job to do when I got back. To my own amazement, it turned out to be cutting the grass. This had exactly the right soothing, easy rhythm that allowed me to cover the length of the garden on a lovely spring evening, and yet acknowledge that I was exhausted and good for nothing, really. </p> <p>The crab and pear blossom is stunning and Sarah had cut a huge branch of crab apple for a vase in the centre of the kitchen table. The business of cutting flowers is always a battle between house and garden - the gain of one inevitably means the loss of the other - but this was tucked in the hedge, and it was the right decision. If we had more space, I would love a cutting garden where there could be rows of flowers dedicated to decorating the house. As it is, we try to be generous with our planting, so that there is enough to spare for great bunches of flowers without reducing the borders to shreds and tatters. </p> <p>While I was in Crieff, Gareth hired a chipper and chipped the enormous pile of woody material that has accumulated over the winter - part prunings and part the result of alterations that removed a lot of hornbeam hedging. The sprawling heap is now a neat block perhaps 2m square and 1m high. We will leave it until the autumn and use it to mulch the hedges over the winter. </p> <p>We have lifted a section of the terrace where we eat and moved the York stone to the new bit of the jewel garden. This gives us a place to sit there (in what was the chicken run only a couple of years ago) and increases the border in the walled garden. It is exciting on both accounts. Any extra planting space is pounced upon, and this corner had been chosen for paving precisely because it was so sunny. </p> <p>As it turned out, the old terrace was too hot in the middle of the day (when we are most likely to eat outside) and the butter used to melt and people would bake. I'll dig the soil, add plenty of compost and plant it up with roses, rosemary, lavender, verbascums, melianthus, poppies and, in the autumn, tulips for next spring. </p> <p>The new site for the paving has an experimental cover made from a post at each corner of the square and bean sticks nailed an inch apart over the top. I remember sitting under a similar shelter in Mexico - it was the business. But it is experimental at the moment because it does rather spoil the view across the river to the church. Which matters more, shelter or view? Time will tell. </p> <p> It is odd how some people still have a thing about annuals. Too much trouble, too garish, too ephemeral, too common. Annuals fire horticultural snobbery - which is always on a hair trigger at the best of times - in the same way that hanging baskets and garden ornaments do. And yet garden centres will sell more trays of annuals over the coming month or two than all their other plants put together over the whole year. </p> <p>Somebody out there likes them - I certainly do. We grow hundreds and hundreds of them, and would grow more if we had the space. It's what you do with them that counts, and I see annuals as an integral part of the overall floral mix in our borders. Ignore or dismiss them and you impoverish your garden. The key is to choose annuals that work with your other plants rather than restrict yourself to a 'display' that is not harmonised with anything in particular. </p> <p>Roger Phillips and Martyn Rix, in the introduction to their excellent book, Annuals (Macmillan, \u00a319.99), make the point that most modern cultivars tend to be lower, stockier and more garish than their wild relatives because the flowers are tested in open fields, where taller plants would blow over and more subtle colours would become lost. However, few gardens are like open-trials fields and the plants have a very different effect when brought into the restricted, sheltered environment of a back garden. The reasons that growers persist in this is because their biggest customers are not garden centres but local authorities and corporations buying in bulk for summer titivation of public areas. </p> <p>An annual is any plant that germinates, grows, flowers and sets seed in the same growing season - usually between March and October in this country, although some annuals, such as field poppies and corn marigolds, can string together a complete life-cycle in around three months. Drought will speed up the cycle as they race to set seed before the lack of water kills them. </p> <p>In the wild, most annuals are found in cornfields or on dry, open slopes. They are rarely found in tightly packed places interspersed with shrubs, or in damp conditions - both of which are closer to the conditions of the average back garden than a cornfield. And most annuals prefer to be dry and in full sun when they are in flower - a summer like the one that we all endured in 1998 reduces many to soggy tissue. </p> <p>My own preference is to use annuals as a deliberate part of controlled colour schemes, interweaving them with perennials, shrubs and bulbs. At this time of year, it is easier to do this with biennials (plants that complete their life cycle in two years) such as forget-me-nots ( Myosotis sylvatica ) and wallflowers ( Cheiranthus cheiri , although also Erysimum cheiri ), which grow outside our window among 'Queen of the Night' and 'Black Parrot' tulips, and purple honesty ( Lunaria annua ), in the shade of a huge Rosa rugosa . It will not be long before the Iceland poppies are out, and the sweet peas are starting to put on growth now that their roots are stretching out into the soil and they should start flowering in June. </p> <p>The greenhouse and cold frames are now crammed with seedlings of sunflowers, cosmos, cornflowers, tithonias, leonotis, salvias, cleomes, tobacco plants (only sylvestris ), lupins, helianthus, rudbeckia and cerinthe. Poppies have been sown direct (they intensely dislike being moved about, even as tiny seedlings) and the purple orache has seeded itself like a lovely weed, exactly matching the silvery purple of the negrita tulips. Another annual that can be relied upon to pop up everywhere year after year (as long as the ground is cultivated) is the fabulous Verbena bonariensis , which will flower from July through to November. </p> <p>Most of these are half-hardy, and it would not be safe to put them outside yet, as we are likely to get frost until mid-May. The hardy annuals are only grown indoors because they are less prone to slug attack that way. It means more handling but guarantees more plants. I also find that if you have a fairly mature border, annuals grown in pots or plugs can be planted more accurately than any amount of direct seed sowing. </p> <p>Which is not to say that sowing direct is a bad idea, especially if you live in a mild area or if your garden is reasonably sheltered and dry. For the new garden or novice, nothing is more satisfying than a few packets of seeds sown into soil that has been dug and raked to a fine tilth. Do not feed the soil with manure, as that will only produce lots of green growth without any extra flowers. The best way is to sow in zig-zags, crosses, circles or lines to differentiate the growing seedlings from weeds. The only hard bit is to sow much more thinly than seems sensible and then to be ruthless enough to thin the seedlings further so that each plant has room to expand. Poppies, cornflowers, helianthus, eschscholzia, phacelia, nasturtiums, calendula, nigella and zinnias, for example, will all do well when sown directly where they are to flower. </p> <p>In an age of instant garden gratification and magic transformation, no flowers do more in less time than annuals. A few packets of seed are certainly the cheapest and easiest way to a makeover. </p> <p><strong> Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong><br> </p> <p> Observer readers can order six Nicotiana sylvestris (otherwise known as the tobacco plant) for \u00a39.99, including p&amp;p. They reach a height of 1.5m, with a spread of 60cm. Send a cheque payable to Thompson &amp; Morgan (Young Plants) Ltd to: Observer Offers, OBT24, PO Box 89, St Leonards-0n-Sea, East Sussex TN38 9ZX, or call 0870 870 1362 with credit-card details. Last order date: 30 May. Allow up to 28 days for delivery </p> <p><strong>Your roots:</strong> How to make the most of your annuals </p> <p> Hardy annuals withstand frost but need light to grow and flower. They are best sown or planted in March or April and will flower until they have set all their seed. Dead-heading flowers as they fade will encourage them to keep on flowering for longer. Opium poppies, nasturtiums, nigellas, cornflowers, sweet peas and corn cockles are all hardy annuals. </p> <p>Half-hardy annuals are frost-tender and should only be planted or sown after the middle of May. The first frosts of autumn kill them. Bells of Ireland, zinnias, nicotianas, sunflowers, busy Lizzies and snapdragons are half-hardy annuals. </p> <p><strong> Preparing annuals for cutting</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Make extra sure of feeding them (to encourage vigorous plants with large flowers and long stems). </p> <p> \u0095 Thin them carefully, cutting selectively to thin them out throughout the flowering season. </p> <p> \u0095 Sow two or three successive crops, starting in March and finishing at the end of May. </p> <p><strong> Climbing annuals</strong> </p> <p>Sweet peas ( Lathyrus odoratus ) are the best of all annual climbers. Avoid modern varieties and stick to reliably scented plants such as the Spencer group. </p> <p>Sweet peas grow well up a trellis, netting, or in a pot up a wigwam of canes. If planted at the base of a wall, they'll need lots of water. They like the richest soil possible. If you keep picking the flowers, they will flower on into August. </p> <p>Black-eyed Susan ( Thunbergia alata ) grows to 10ft and has yellow or orange flowers with chocolate centres. Ipomoea tricolor (morning glory) is easy if raised in warm, humid conditions, then planted in sun. The canary creeper ( Tropaeolum peregrinum ) grows fast with yellow flowers. </p> <p><strong> Tall annuals</strong> </p> <p>Any annual growing over 4ft will need some support. But they can be very useful at the back of a border to stagger the height of flowering. Hollyhock ( Alcea rosea ) will reach 8ft and is excellent for a softer, cottage-garden feel. Sunflowers ( Helianthus annuus ) are not all giants and not all sunny yellow. 'Velvet Queen' is a glorious russet and 'Lemon Queen' is lemon yellow. Both grow to about 5ft. </p> <p> Nicotiana sylvestris has my favourite scent of all plants and grows to 4ft or 5ft. Cosmos bipinnatis is a tall, delicately branched plant with beautifully elegant flowers. They need dead-heading daily to prolong flowering. Try the white 'Purity'. </p> <p><strong> Scented annuals</strong> </p> <p>Because they are so desperate for pollination, scent is often an important part of the annual's armoury. Use it! These are just a few of my favourite scented annuals: Nicotiana sylvestris , lemon verbena and Lippia citriodora . Night-scented stock ( Matthiola incana ) has a warm, spicy scent and the fragrance of the evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis ) is much stronger at night. </p> <p><strong> Annuals for shade</strong> </p> <p>Although most annuals really need as much sun as possible, some have adapted to grow in shade. My favourite is the white foxglove, Digitalis purpurea f. albiflora , which will gracefully grow in almost complete shade and, like night-scented stock, dry shade at that. </p> <p>Tobacco plants all grow in shade (but do not necessarily prefer it). The monkey flower, mimulus, is completely happy without direct light. Evening primrose grows anywhere with some moisture or heavy soil - it seeds very freely.</p>",
