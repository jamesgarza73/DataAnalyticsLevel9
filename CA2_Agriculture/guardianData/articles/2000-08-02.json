A simple arrangement built up in intensity as a metallic guitar and choppy violin led to a middle-eight for which the band turned their backs on the audience and, well, wiggled. Suffice to say, Shocked's slow, rhythmic hip sway was the most convincing. Taking requests, the sultry, long-haired singer led us through Blackberry Blossom and Secret to a Long Life, her every head-shake, smirk and aside adding theatre along the way. She may have been a fighter once but she's a true entertainer now. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

Pension lobbyists like Help the Aged and Age Concern applauded the stance taken by the social security select committee, chaired by the Liberal Democrat, Archy Kirkwood. At the moment, single pensioners get a minimum income guarantee (MIG) of \u00a378.45. But the cross-party committee went some way to meeting the much-criticised approach of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, and Alistair Darling, the social security secretary. They are targeting extra help on the most needy, despite the flak they have taken. \"The government should raise the level of retirement pension for those aged 80, so that it is, and remains, at the equivalent level of the minimum income guarantee,\" the MPs said. They noted that \"the oldest look set to remain among the poorest, and particularly the oldest women\". But they implicitly rejected Mr Brown's insistence that the basic, non-means-tested pension rise by only the inflation rate. The 75p rise which resulted in April prompted widespread anger among pensioners, many of whom regard the pension as a right for which their taxes have paid - and see the MIG top-up as charity. Ministers are struggling to persuade 500,000 eligible pensioners to claim MIG (a campaign the committee endorsed) and are devising a tax credit for pensioners to help those with some savings which take them a little above the MIG level. It is a sore point among those who have tried to provide for themselves. The MPs' inquiry concluded that raising the basic state pension is \"inevitable\" and should be done \"sooner rather than later\". It is affordable, the MPs in sist. They also called for more research, not least on ethnic poverty in old age. The committee argued: \"Moreover, if it is right for the minimum income guarantee (MIG) to be linked to earnings, so too must both components of the state pension, if we wish pensioners to share equally in the rising prosperity of the nation.\" With an election looming and \"grey power\" on the march, the MPs may now be pushing an open door.

The free television licence for over-75s is also universal. Backed by Labour MPs on his committee yesterday, Mr Kirkwood said: \"We are nailing our colours to the mast. \"We are saying to the government, if they don't think \u00a390 is modest, they should work out what the figure should be. That should be the target and it should be achieved in the minimum time possible.\"",

Their Prom found them on blistering form in a programme of Prokofiev and Shostakovich, which proved a riveting evening despite the occasional idiosyncrasy. The final item consisted of extracts from Romeo and Juliet - a conflation, in fact, of the first two orchestral suites which Prokofiev prepared before the ballet's 1940 premiere. Gatti fuses the various movements into a narrative whole, which might displease some purists, but which makes compelling listening. The rich, sensual RPO sound and Gatti's fondness for extreme dynamics and tempi are telling in this music. The lovers' passion is kindled into tremulous life in the ballroom scene before Gatti plunges into an account of the balcony pas de deux which is flagrantly erotic, almost brutally sexual. Around them swirls the sectarian violence, which Gatti infuses with thrilling terror. </p> <p>The whole grabs you from start to finish despite the occasional flaw. Tybalt's death is taken at such a lick that the players occasionally seem hard pressed to get all the notes in. The famous Montagues and Capulets sequence came unstuck balance-wise in places with the brass and percussion occasionally drowning out the strings. A similar weight pervaded the Classical Symphony, which came over as anything but the usual volatile jeu d'esprit. Gatti favours slower tempi than most conductors and fills the symphony with a nostalgic sweetness, only allowing irony to punctuate the gavotte, a quiet reminder, perhaps, that the work dates from 1917, when revolution was in the air and the classical world was about to vanish for good. </p> <p>In between came Shostakovich's great, controversial First Violin Concerto with the glorious, glamorous Vedim Repin as soloist. It ranks among the most bitter of Shostakovich's outpourings during the Stalinist years, a strange, unique entanglement of threnody, rage and grotesque bravado. The demands it makes on the soloist are formidable. Repin, who has made the work his own of late, is superb throughout, whether conveying the morose stillness of the central passacaglia, mourning lyrically in the opening nocturne or swirling through the scherzo with almost demonic fury. During the awesome cadenza, the audience held its breath and you could have heard the proverbial pin drop. Gatti's conducting is dark, febrile and tense throughout. He isn't well known as a Shostakovich interpreter. After this, he should be.</p> <p>***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable <br>** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

After meeting behind closed doors for nearly four hours, the 20 justices put off a final decision until at least next week. No date was set for a new session, said court secretary Carlos Meneses.</p> <p>\"We have made progress but it was not possible to make a decision,\" said Justice Guillermo Navas.</p> <p>But several radio stations and a local Internet newspaper, El Mostrador, quoted anonymous court sources as saying that the justices voted 11-9 against Pinochet but decided not to make an announcement until the legal text of the ruling was written.</p> <p>The Pinochet side was invigorated by the apparent division among the justices, said Ricardo Rivadeneira, the former dictator's attorney.</p> <p>\"We have waited for justice for 26 years.

      "bodyText": "Chile's Supreme Court said Tuesday that it postponed making a decision on whether to strip General Augusto Pinochet of his immunity, clearing the way for him to stand trial on human rights charges. But the Chilean media reported later that the justices had agreed to rule against Pinochet but decided not to announce their verdict until later. After meeting behind closed doors for nearly four hours, the 20 justices put off a final decision until at least next week. No date was set for a new session, said court secretary Carlos Meneses. \"We have made progress but it was not possible to make a decision,\" said Justice Guillermo Navas. But several radio stations and a local Internet newspaper, El Mostrador, quoted anonymous court sources as saying that the justices voted 11-9 against Pinochet but decided not to make an announcement until the legal text of the ruling was written. The Pinochet side was invigorated by the apparent division among the justices, said Ricardo Rivadeneira, the former dictator's attorney. \"We have waited for justice for 26 years. We can wait yet another week,\" said Viviana Diaz, president of an organization of relatives of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by Pinochet's secret police. The justices' meeting prompted small but noisy groups of pro- and anti-Pinochet demonstrators to gather outside the courthouse, exchanging insults across the street where police had blocked traffic. At one point, several anti-Pinochet demonstrators dressed in black lay on the ground on a nearby street, blocking traffic. The pro-Pinochet demonstrators burned a Spanish flag. A Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, issued the warrant that kept Pinochet under house arrest in London for 16 months until last March. He was released after British doctors said he was mentally and physically unfit to stand trial. Even if the Supreme Court decides to lift Pinochet's immunity, it remains unclear whether the ailing general who still so dramatically divides Chilean society would ever face trial. Pinochet faces 153 criminal complaints and judge Juan Guzman is seeking his trial in one of them, the so-called \"caravan of death\", a military squad that summarily executed 72 political prisoners in several cities shortly after Pinochet's bloody 1973 coup. Even if the court rules against Pinochet, plaintiffs' lawyer Hugo Gutierrez said he was not sure if he would immediately seek an indictment. Gutierrez and other anti-Pinochet lawyers and activists have said it would satisfy them just to see Pinochet stripped of immunity.",

I've spoken to him and I know he will leave a hole. He's done a fantastic job.\" Coppell said his third spell at Palace would be his last but is expected to stay in football. He said: \"For the last couple of years I have been 100% my own boss. I made every football decision. It was a personal utopia. Simon came in the summer and I came to the conclusion that leaving was in the best interests of Simon and Palace. \"It's best he has his own men ... I would have been too loyal to the players who worked so hard for me last year. It needs a cold, clinical eye.\"",

After the four-hour meeting, all said they had reached \"common ground\" - all parties aimed to protect children from paedophiles.

      "byline": "Rory McCarthy",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Long before Pakistan tested its first atomic devices in the deserts of Baluchistan two years ago, its nuclear intentions had been a source of international concern.</p> <p>Now the military regime has used the country's newspapers to publish a document which is styled as being a form to be filled in by anybody seeking permission to export nuclear materials and equipment.</p> <p>Under the headline \"Nuclear Substances Category (please tick)\" the form lists 17 radioactive substances including depleted uranium, enriched uranium, plutonium and tritium which it claims will be considered for export.</p> <p>In addition, it says, equipment including nuclear reactors and reactor control systems will be considered. All exports are to be for peaceful use only, it insists, and the export of fissionable material - which includes enriched uranium and plutonium - is banned.</p> <p>Pakistan's administration says the form is simply an attempt at transparency to prove there is a clear system of control over the nuclear industry.</p> <p>But it seems unlikely that the country's rulers actually expect a potential exporter to cut out the form, tick appropriate categories and send in the request for permission to export such sensitive material.</p> <p>While some analysts are saying that publication of the form could be read as a sign that the regime hoped to use nuclear exports for the first time to salvage the economy, there is also the suspicion that the timing of publication is no coincidence.</p> <p>Pakistan's main flashpoint with India has just sparked again, with Pakistani-backed militants under suspicion for a new spate of murders in Kashmir. Islamabad may feel this is a moment to send a less-than-subtle warning to its neighbours and the world against leaning on Pakistan - by reminding them that it is a nuclear state.</p> <p>Although it was just two years ago that Pakistan held its first publicly announced test explosions of devices it said could be used in nuclear weapons, its nuclear industry has been growing for 30 years. The country's first nuclear reactor was built with Canadian help in the southern port city of Karachi in 1971.</p> <p>A second and much larger reactor, this time built with help from China, went into operation last month. There are at least two uranium enrichment plants and two plutonium reprocessing plants in the country, as well as a nuclear research reactor reported to be making plutonium for warheads.</p> <p>The country is refusing to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty (in common with Israel, India and China, to name just three). And there is no doubting the pride Pakistanis feel in their nuclear status. Statues of missiles and even of Chagai mountain, the site of the 1998 nuclear tests, adorn roundabouts and road junctions in cities across Pakistan.</p> <p>Implicit in the newspaper forms is a second warning: that Pakistan should not be trifled with by larger powers, because it could retaliate by deciding to sell nuclear-related materials to rogue states.</p> <p>Islamabad has always promised not to sell its nuclear know-how, and it says there have been no exports of nuclear materials in the past.</p> <p>The country is clearly nervous about any international backlash over the new killings in Kashmir - killings whose timing is probably no accident either, coming as they have just as peace talks involving India were scheduled.</p> <p>Pakistan has been struggling to improve its reputation after last summer's debacle in which a fourth war with India seemed close to being ignited by an incursion along the frontier with Kashmir, over which India has formal sovereignty.</p> <p>Pakistan's economy is in a bad state and the military regime, which seized power in a coup in October, is well aware that a recovery is needed for any other reforms to succeed. Some 80% of Pakistan's annual budget is swallowed up by military spending and loan repayments.</p> <p>The army says it is cracking down on corruption to reclaim unpaid loans and money lost to bribery; it is also launching a drive to get taxes collected.</p> <p>Islamabad is still waiting for the International Monetary Fund to release a $1.6bn loan that has been frozen since the coup. Reports here say that loan money may be held back until at least November.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Long before Pakistan tested its first atomic devices in the deserts of Baluchistan two years ago, its nuclear intentions had been a source of international concern. Now the military regime has used the country's newspapers to publish a document which is styled as being a form to be filled in by anybody seeking permission to export nuclear materials and equipment. Under the headline \"Nuclear Substances Category (please tick)\" the form lists 17 radioactive substances including depleted uranium, enriched uranium, plutonium and tritium which it claims will be considered for export. In addition, it says, equipment including nuclear reactors and reactor control systems will be considered. All exports are to be for peaceful use only, it insists, and the export of fissionable material - which includes enriched uranium and plutonium - is banned. Pakistan's administration says the form is simply an attempt at transparency to prove there is a clear system of control over the nuclear industry. But it seems unlikely that the country's rulers actually expect a potential exporter to cut out the form, tick appropriate categories and send in the request for permission to export such sensitive material. While some analysts are saying that publication of the form could be read as a sign that the regime hoped to use nuclear exports for the first time to salvage the economy, there is also the suspicion that the timing of publication is no coincidence. Pakistan's main flashpoint with India has just sparked again, with Pakistani-backed militants under suspicion for a new spate of murders in Kashmir. Islamabad may feel this is a moment to send a less-than-subtle warning to its neighbours and the world against leaning on Pakistan - by reminding them that it is a nuclear state. Although it was just two years ago that Pakistan held its first publicly announced test explosions of devices it said could be used in nuclear weapons, its nuclear industry has been growing for 30 years. The country's first nuclear reactor was built with Canadian help in the southern port city of Karachi in 1971. A second and much larger reactor, this time built with help from China, went into operation last month. There are at least two uranium enrichment plants and two plutonium reprocessing plants in the country, as well as a nuclear research reactor reported to be making plutonium for warheads. The country is refusing to sign the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty (in common with Israel, India and China, to name just three). And there is no doubting the pride Pakistanis feel in their nuclear status. Statues of missiles and even of Chagai mountain, the site of the 1998 nuclear tests, adorn roundabouts and road junctions in cities across Pakistan. Implicit in the newspaper forms is a second warning: that Pakistan should not be trifled with by larger powers, because it could retaliate by deciding to sell nuclear-related materials to rogue states. Islamabad has always promised not to sell its nuclear know-how, and it says there have been no exports of nuclear materials in the past. The country is clearly nervous about any international backlash over the new killings in Kashmir - killings whose timing is probably no accident either, coming as they have just as peace talks involving India were scheduled. Pakistan has been struggling to improve its reputation after last summer's debacle in which a fourth war with India seemed close to being ignited by an incursion along the frontier with Kashmir, over which India has formal sovereignty. Pakistan's economy is in a bad state and the military regime, which seized power in a coup in October, is well aware that a recovery is needed for any other reforms to succeed. Some 80% of Pakistan's annual budget is swallowed up by military spending and loan repayments. The army says it is cracking down on corruption to reclaim unpaid loans and money lost to bribery; it is also launching a drive to get taxes collected. Islamabad is still waiting for the International Monetary Fund to release a $1.6bn loan that has been frozen since the coup. Reports here say that loan money may be held back until at least November.",

      "bodyText": "General Colin Powell re-emerged yesterday as America's most potent unifying figure after an impassioned address to the Republican national convention, in which the black Gulf war hero challenged his party to don \"the mantle of Lincoln\" and embrace minorities. General Powell's appearance was part of a carefully orchestrated lineup, heavily weighted with blacks and Hispanics, intended to promote the presidential candidate, George W Bush, as a new, culturally sensitive breed of Republican. The general's powerful oratory, however, also served as a reminder of his towering national stature in comparison with either of the presidential candidates; his popularity rating stands at 81%, nearly 20 points ahead of Mr Bush, and more than 30 points clear of the Democratic contender, Vice-President Al Gore. His performance late on Monday night, which electrified the crowd in the Philadelphia convention hall, once more raised the question of whether the Harlem-born general might be persuaded to run for president. The former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff opted not to enter the 1996 race, despite wide support, mainly because his wife, Alma, feared that their family life would be shattered. But the Republicans are confident that Gen Powell would accept a senior cabinet post in a Bush administration, a possibility that the Texas governor hinted at, saying: \"I hope his greatest service to America might still lie ahead.\" The general's capabilities as a political leader were made plain by the delirious reception he received from the Republican faithful, who found themselves standing and applauding views diametrically opposed to theirs on education, government spending, affirmative action and the role of big business in politics. The contrast bluntly posed the dilemma facing a party leadership seeking to portray a moderate, all-inclusive image while simultaneously maintaining a highly conservative activist power base. The general, viewed as one of the architects of the victory in the Gulf war, called for greater expenditure on schools, and a dialogue with US black leaders, including radicals, not just in an election year. But his most controversial moment came when he suggested that Republican hypocrisy was contributing to the widespread cynicism prevalent among minorities. \"Some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an education, but hardly a whimper is heard from them over affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes with preferences for special interests,\" he said. The remarks represented a dual challenge to Republican orthodoxy. They were an undisguised attack on the power wielded by corporate special interests, whose role in US politics is defended by most Republicans as an extension of the right to free speech. The general's address also confronted most Republican activists' deep-seated opposition to affirmative action programmes designed to promote minorities. The 2000 official party platform states: \"We will attain our nation's goal of equal opportunity without quotas or other forms of preferential treatment.\" Questioned later about this divergentce of views, General Powell simply said he had not read the platform document, which he described as \"less and less relevant\" to the party's actual policies. His remarks reflected the gap between the Republican party members on the podium this week, and those milling around on the convention floor. The two groups appeared to represent two different countries: The public face was that of a multi-ethnic melting pot, in which black or Hispanic Republicans were close to a majority; the latter was a near-monochrome assembly, where 96% of the delegates were white. Neither version of the party was representative. In a New York Times survey this week, Republican delegates expressed opinions far to the right of the rank and file on almost every issue from affirmative action to gun control. On the podium, meanwhile, one minority representative after another came to the microphone: A 10-year-old native American girl sang the national anthem, and a rabbi provided the prayers; there were hip-hop and rock performances and at one point the hall took on the spirit of a revivalist meeting with a black gospel choir and a video address from the preacher of a black Philadelphia church. However, according to David Bositis, a political analyst at the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies in Washington, the multi-hued presentation had little to do with courting minorities. \"It's not intended for black Americans,\" said Mr Bositis, the author of a study published this week called Blacks and the 2000 Republican National Convention. \"What the Republicans are doing is aimed more at white Americans. Bush wants to differentiate himself from the Republicans in Congress, and what better way than reaching out to African Americans,\" he said.

Why? To support Comrade Rivaldo, of course! Because while the likes of Alessandro del Piero are driving their crazy cars and a earning a cool \u00a375,000-a-week, Red Riv hasn't been awarded a pay rise since August 1997 and has had to scrimp a living on about half that amount.</p> <p>And who says union action doesn't work? Because today the Brazilian Bolshevik (OK, we might be making that bit up) finally signed a new deal worth \u00a385,000 a week after tax to stay at Barcelona until 2003. In other words, a cool \u00a34.4m a year. Net. And wasn't he happy! \"It's lucky that Nunez has gone,\" laughed Red Riv, having a pop at Barca's former president who reneged on a promise to give him an improved contract after two seasons. \"But now Gaspart has been true to his word and I'm very happy, because I wanted to stay at Barca.\" </p> <p>Of course he did. Which is why the rumours of a \u00a329m Milan bid, and the reported sighting of Milan executive Adriano Galliani jetting off to Catalonia for more talks with Rivaldo, were completely wide of the mark. (we'll picket the house of anyone that says otherwise). But was Gaspart ecstatic about securing Red Riv's services for another three years? Well, surprisingly, he wasn't. \"Barcelona have gone a bit mad to pay this money,\" he admitted, staring wistfully at his empty wallet, \"but the important thing is that it has all finished and Rivaldo can go off happy and contented.\" Now that's what Citizen Fiver calls man management.</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>Win a fantasy night for you and 5 of your friends courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.e-street.com\">http://www.e-street.com</a> - the essential new service for planning your shopping, eating and drinking in London.</p> <p><strong>DIAMOND LIFE</strong></p> <p>Last season, Airdrie fans had a dismal time of it.

      "bodyText": "IF IT'S ABOUT SPAIN, IT MUST BE ABOUT MONEY For some time, Citizen Fiver has been swotting up on the Barcelona rent strike of 1931, while rallying good union men and singing \"the footballers united will never be defeated\" to bemused onlookers outside the Camp Nou. Why? To support Comrade Rivaldo, of course! Because while the likes of Alessandro del Piero are driving their crazy cars and a earning a cool \u00a375,000-a-week, Red Riv hasn't been awarded a pay rise since August 1997 and has had to scrimp a living on about half that amount. And who says union action doesn't work? Because today the Brazilian Bolshevik (OK, we might be making that bit up) finally signed a new deal worth \u00a385,000 a week after tax to stay at Barcelona until 2003. In other words, a cool \u00a34.4m a year. Net. And wasn't he happy! \"It's lucky that Nunez has gone,\" laughed Red Riv, having a pop at Barca's former president who reneged on a promise to give him an improved contract after two seasons. \"But now Gaspart has been true to his word and I'm very happy, because I wanted to stay at Barca.\" Of course he did. Which is why the rumours of a \u00a329m Milan bid, and the reported sighting of Milan executive Adriano Galliani jetting off to Catalonia for more talks with Rivaldo, were completely wide of the mark. (we'll picket the house of anyone that says otherwise). But was Gaspart ecstatic about securing Red Riv's services for another three years? Well, surprisingly, he wasn't. \"Barcelona have gone a bit mad to pay this money,\" he admitted, staring wistfully at his empty wallet, \"but the important thing is that it has all finished and Rivaldo can go off happy and contented.\" Now that's what Citizen Fiver calls man management.

Under William Hague, Massow says the party has \"become less compassionate, more intolerant and, frankly, just plain nasty\". The evidence is on his side: above all, in Hague's public support for the retention of section 28, an invalid and discriminatory piece of legislation so badly-drafted it has never been used in court. As a gay man whose business makes money from other gay men, one can understand that he found this hard to stomach.

A diet of laughter is just as important as one of organic vegetables. </p> <p>They say that the roots of all adult humour can be seen in toddlers. Indeed, during her first two years, my daughter Lola enjoyed blowing raspberries, wearing silly hats and pants on her head, knocking me over and seeing me deliberately drop her football. Knocking over a brick tower I had painstakingly built was even better. The sound of family flatulence caused her to chuckle and exclaim \"Daddy's bottom!\" And she laughed at me dropping my trousers when getting dressed. From the material I used to make my daughter laugh, most comics could probably furnish an entire act at the Comedy Store. </p> <p>The first time your baby roars with laughter is a memorable moment, up there with the first \"dada\". For Lola, it was a hint of danger that set her off. To disapproving looks from some mothers and right-on dads I used to take her buggy racing, running along park pathways, steering the buggy one-handed or shouting \"Look, no hands!\" as I allowed it to freewheel downhill. At other times I'd pretend to throw her through the window or startle her with a \"Boo!\" during a game of peekaboo. According to people-watching guru Desmond Morris, it's not just Lola who laughs in the face of fear. This, he says, is the principle of the \"safe shock\". The baby realises that the action stops short of being dangerous because it is performed by a trusted parent. </p> <p>\"The repeated discovery that the threat is not serious is such a relief, that it brings with it a special kind of joy - the joy of establishing that a fear is unfounded,\" wrote Morris in Babywatching. He adds that this is the whole basis, the very origin of adult humour. \"The comments of the professional comedian are basically frightening, but instead of scaring us they amuse us because we know all along that this man making the comments is not after all a policeman or a politician but a comic.\" </p> <p>Indeed there are many parallels. Certainly children share our adult love of toilet humour. \"I've noticed that my two-year-old daughter Anna likes making her dollies fart,\" says London mother Rachel Mooney. An animal pooing at the zoo will create a buzz of excitement among young visitors - an elephant defecating in the water will cause the chuckle register to go off the scale. </p> <p>\"Certainly odd things are happening to their bodies,\" says Dr Nigel King, reader in psychology at the University of Huddersfield. \"Nobody tells them the rules, they have to work it out for themselves by testing boundaries. There's also an element of establishing power, of asking: 'Can I get away with it?' </p> <p>\"Humour at this age is to do with contravening expectations or having a forbidden tone. Slapstick is a kind of violation. It's seeing someone of higher status or power than you having their dignity exploded.\" </p> <p>As kids get older this can become more pronounced. Comic Helen Lederer has noticed an anti-authoritarian tendency in her 10-year-old daughter. \"She likes institutional comedy, things like Dinnerladies. Anything similar to their world being undermined is funny to children,\" she says. \"I think they like authority being challenged. The other day she said, ironically, to a nice young community policeman: 'You're doing a great job.' There's no such thing as respect, which I guess is similar to a lot of comedy. Although perhaps you shouldn't ask me as my daughter says I don't understand what's funny!\" </p> <p>Young children love order, but conversely, another thing that makes toddlers laugh is when we, the adults, slip up. It proves that they know the rules. \"The funniest thing in the world for my daughter, who is just two, is me or her dad making a mistake,\" says her mum Becky Roberts. \"The other night, I handed Clare a grey rabbit and said: 'Here's pink rabbit.' For hours afterwards she lay in her cot laughing out loud and saying to herself, 'Mummy said pink rabbit!' I suppose we must seem omnipotent or something.\" </p> <p>Another common joke is the deliberate contradiction. My daughter now enjoys calling mummy 'daddy' or, when holding a piece of orange, insisting: \"It's not an orange it's a Shreddie!\" Recently when I asked her if she was my daughter she replied \"No!\" When I looked shocked she gleefully exclaimed \"I'm funny!\" She made her first wordplay when her mum asked me: \"Can you put Lola's dressing-gown on?\" \"It's not yours, it's my dressing-gown!\" declared Lola, followed by an endearing \"Is that funny?\" (If only Jim Davidson asked such questions.) </p> <p>\"In a way the deliberate contradiction is a child showing its mastery,\" says King. \"They know it's not true and they know that you know it's not true. Humour is a good barometer of social understanding. For example, people with autism are very poor at understanding humour. They have very obsessive interests, they're very bright in narrow areas but have trouble interacting socially.\" </p> <p>Nurturing our children's sense of humour is surely an essential part of good parenting. Whatever their problems in adult life, the ability to diffuse tension through laughter will help them. As veteran comedian Ken Dodd said recently: \"There's a lot of childishness in my act - we're all born with a spirit of play. I call it the chuckle muscle. Watch a baby with a bit of paper pretending it's something else. We're all born with this wonderful imagination but unfortunately some people as they get older - perhaps it's the pressures of life - they lose their chuckle muscle. It dries up and drops off.\" </p> <p>King certainly agrees with Dodd in the case of younger children: \"You don't want to say 'we're going to have a joke lesson' to older children because they'd find it embarrassing. But in the younger years, yes, try and encourage it. Humour is closely related to culture, and understanding morality and social convention is linked to jokes. You need to know the rule that says that a man doesn't usually wear a dress to know that it's funny. Rule transgressions can be useful. It's clear where things are meant as a joke, so don't be over punitive as it's probably quite useful if it's mild, although obvi ously I wouldn't encourage swearing or serious rule transgressions.\" </p> <p>As parents, it's also important to remember that we aren't that different from our toddlers. \"Although we add new humour repertoires as we get older we don't lose all the other forms of humour, we don't stop finding basic things funny,\" says King. \"The word 'bottom' is hilariously funny to young kids but most adults find bottom jokes funny too. In a way we're all stuck at three.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>The news that Jerry Hall has invited her two teenage children to see her performing naked on the London stage, albeit for a few brief, dimly lit moments, has caused considerable consternation. No doubt the Hall children have often seen their mother naked, and quite possibly they are proud that their mother is still so magnificently beautiful, but for some parents the prospect of being seen naked by their teenage children fills them with horror. Countless teenagers find the thought of seeing their parents naked - or worse still, having their parents' nudity aired in public - shameful and repulsive. </p> <p>Nowadays, most parents want their children to grow up feeling at ease with nakedness, avoiding all those feelings of prudery and shame which might destroy their chances of finding sexual happiness. All teenagers get embarrassed by their parents, but the degree of that embarrassment depends on the nature of their relationship. When problems arise it is not necessarily the naked body itself that causes distress so much as what it signifies. </p> <p>Teenagers worry about sex, getting old and dying, and the sight of a parent's naked, ageing body can raise all these issues. In families where everyone respects each other's need for privacy and where difficult issues are openly discussed, each person can discover what the others find intrusive and embarrassing and refrain from doing it. But in families where the parents have not respected the child's need for privacy and where sex, old age and death are still taboo, nudity can be a serious issue. </p> <p>Nakedness was never revealed in my family. My parents were born in the Victorian era, so they regarded nudity as sinful and appropriate only when one was alone bathing or dressing. At least I did not have to cover the mirror in the bathroom when I had a shower, as well-brought-up Catholic girls were required to do. The current media obsession with nudity could persuade a visiting Martian that an acceptance of nudity was now the norm, but in fact we are as troubled by nakedness as my parents were. </p> <p>Nakedness amounts to more than not wearing clothes. It always involves being held in our own gaze, and perhaps in the gaze of others, and as a result our sense of being an acceptable person can be called into question. Nakedness renders us vulnerable. The flesh of the young and the beautiful is revealed, while that of the old and the ugly must be decently covered. With our bodies we define our own sense of personal space, and when someone intrudes into that space - by coming too close, by touching us, by commenting on us, or simply by gazing at us - we feel threatened. </p> <p>Parents have to recognise that there is a fine line between being open about nakedness and intruding into their child's precious sense of personal privacy. When my friend Kevin and his 10-year-old son Kieran were staying with me, the matter of Kieran having a much-needed bath arose. Kevin is a very wise and experienced child psychologist, so I was interested to see how he dealt with a boy who had reached the age where bodily accretions of dirt become impervious to water. A 10-year-old boy can emerge from a bath looking exactly as he did when he got in. </p> <p>A parent who believes in a frank and hearty approach to nakedness might ignore his son's protests at being intruded upon and insist on helping with the scrubbing, but Kevin merely offered encouragement through the closed bathroom door: \"Okay, then?\" and \"You might give your neck a bit of a rub.\" As much as Kevin would like his son to be glowingly clean, he regards a child's need for privacy as more important than society's expectation of a high standard of cleanliness. Kevin has always discussed sex with Kieran as the need arose, and death is something they talk about a lot now because Kevin's wife Hilary died not long ago. Consequently I suspect that when Kieran becomes a teenager his embarrassment with Kevin will amount to no more than some gentle teasing. </p> <p>There are ways in which the relaxation of the rules about nakedness in the home have allowed some parents to overstep the boundaries to sexual behaviour which separate parents from children. The false memory debate, about adults remembering childhood instances of parental sexual abuse, was confounded by issues over just what was a sexual assault. Some of the accused fathers insisted quite rightly that they had never engaged in sexual congress with their daughter, but refused to acknowledge that their comments about their daughter's body, their intrusions into her privacy, and the way they looked at her were felt by the girl to be a sexual assault. </p> <p>There is a great difference between the father who chances upon his teenage daughter going naked from bathroom to bedroom, looks at her as he would when she was fully dressed and says \"Hi,\" or \"If you don't hurry you'll be late,\" and the father who, unasked, enters the bathroom, sits on the edge of the bath while she is bathing and comments on her burgeoning bosom and sexual attractiveness, with the seething sexual gaze which, when undesired, terrifies every woman. </p> <p>Nudity may be natural, but we have to be careful to avoid threatening children with it, making too much of it, or intruding into their own sense of privacy. In many families such dangerous intrusions are not so much physical as verbal, where conversations are riddled with relentless criticisms often directed at each others' bodies. One defence is to strive to be perfect. This defence can play quite a large part in the thinking of those young women who become anorexic or bulimic. Then, as people get older and the body sags, failing to resemble the Jerry Halls of this world or to match up to those unrealistic expectations of perfection only leads to misery, and being seen naked by one's more youthful teenager increases the torture. We have come a long way in ridding ourselves of the notion that nakedness is sinful and of the uncomfortable clothes which previous generations had to wear to cover their nudity, but we still have a long way to go in understanding what nakedness means to us. </p> <p>Dorothy Rowe's latest book, Friends and Enemies, will be published by HarperCollins on September 11.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I hadn't noticed the sign on the door of the assisted conception unit before: \"This is not the Early Pregnancy Unit nor the Delivery Suite.\" It certainly isn't. I had come for my egg retrieval operation. They'd discovered that my ovaries were so unusually high that they'd have to remove my eggs by inserting two large needles through my stomach. </p> <p>I, of course, had carried my eggs in with me. But the sperm had to be produced. We live close enough to the hospital that my boyfriend could do \"it\" at home. \"You'd have thought,\" he said, eyeing the narrow opening of the little plastic collection pot, \"they'd have designed something better by now. Set Conran on to it.\" But I was appalled, embarrassed even, when the man with whom I've been living for years suggested that I joined in, that we turned \"it\" into a pleasurable moment. The cold medical procedure I'm going through is so dissociated from sex that the thought that they might be linked seemed shocking. It's like getting aroused about taking an aspirin. </p> <p>A man's role in IVF treatment is not at all satisfying. It's up to the female partner to do everything. My boyfriend tried to become involved, asking me every couple of days if I'd remembered to sniff my Buserelin, or putting the needle in the syringe for my morning injection of FSH, but basically he was redundant, apart from this moment of producing the raw material. Perhaps that's why he wanted it to be special. </p> <p>It's very lonely undergoing IVF. At the moment it's happening, it's practically impossible to tell anyone at all about it. Even in the waiting room there's no camaraderie. No one ever looks up towards another's eye. You just flick through old copies of Country Living, as if enthralled by the possibility of redesigning your patio, if you had one. </p> <p>The very worst thing is knowing someone who's going through fertility treatment at the same time. I had a terror of meeting a friend, also having IVF at my hospital, in the waiting room. Perhaps they'd have already reached embryo transfer, when I wasn't sure I was going to have successful egg retrieval. It's not like sharing other intimacies about boyfriends, office troubles, illnesses even. It's an intense agony, with the faintest possibility of being followed by ecstasy. When I asked the doctor what chance I now had of getting pregnant she said around 40%, then corrected herself: \"But it's either 100% or nil for you.\" She's right. There's nothing in between. </p> <p>You'll find our fears and hopes in magazines devoted to infertile couples' tales of repeated attempts to have a child. These magazines are sore reading. One woman writes, after a failed IVF cycle in which she saw two embryos on a screen: \"To help me cope I would like some acknowledgment, private and public, that my embryos were alive and were potential little people, but are no longer in this world. I would ask everyone who reads this letter to say a private goodbye to them, with a prayer if you are religious, to wish them well.\" The only comfort is in strangers. </p> <p> I awoke from my egg retrieval woozy and with two plasters on my tummy. The nurse told me several times that they'd removed eight eggs. The knockout egg-retrieval drugs make you so forgetful that every patient repeats for hours afterwards: \"How many eggs was it, then?

      "bodyText": "I hadn't noticed the sign on the door of the assisted conception unit before: \"This is not the Early Pregnancy Unit nor the Delivery Suite.\" It certainly isn't. I had come for my egg retrieval operation. They'd discovered that my ovaries were so unusually high that they'd have to remove my eggs by inserting two large needles through my stomach. I, of course, had carried my eggs in with me. But the sperm had to be produced. We live close enough to the hospital that my boyfriend could do \"it\" at home. \"You'd have thought,\" he said, eyeing the narrow opening of the little plastic collection pot, \"they'd have designed something better by now. Set Conran on to it.\" But I was appalled, embarrassed even, when the man with whom I've been living for years suggested that I joined in, that we turned \"it\" into a pleasurable moment. The cold medical procedure I'm going through is so dissociated from sex that the thought that they might be linked seemed shocking. It's like getting aroused about taking an aspirin. A man's role in IVF treatment is not at all satisfying. It's up to the female partner to do everything. My boyfriend tried to become involved, asking me every couple of days if I'd remembered to sniff my Buserelin, or putting the needle in the syringe for my morning injection of FSH, but basically he was redundant, apart from this moment of producing the raw material. Perhaps that's why he wanted it to be special. It's very lonely undergoing IVF. At the moment it's happening, it's practically impossible to tell anyone at all about it. Even in the waiting room there's no camaraderie. No one ever looks up towards another's eye. You just flick through old copies of Country Living, as if enthralled by the possibility of redesigning your patio, if you had one. The very worst thing is knowing someone who's going through fertility treatment at the same time. I had a terror of meeting a friend, also having IVF at my hospital, in the waiting room. Perhaps they'd have already reached embryo transfer, when I wasn't sure I was going to have successful egg retrieval. It's not like sharing other intimacies about boyfriends, office troubles, illnesses even. It's an intense agony, with the faintest possibility of being followed by ecstasy. When I asked the doctor what chance I now had of getting pregnant she said around 40%, then corrected herself: \"But it's either 100% or nil for you.\" She's right. There's nothing in between. You'll find our fears and hopes in magazines devoted to infertile couples' tales of repeated attempts to have a child. These magazines are sore reading. One woman writes, after a failed IVF cycle in which she saw two embryos on a screen: \"To help me cope I would like some acknowledgment, private and public, that my embryos were alive and were potential little people, but are no longer in this world. I would ask everyone who reads this letter to say a private goodbye to them, with a prayer if you are religious, to wish them well.\" The only comfort is in strangers. I awoke from my egg retrieval woozy and with two plasters on my tummy. The nurse told me several times that they'd removed eight eggs. The knockout egg-retrieval drugs make you so forgetful that every patient repeats for hours afterwards: \"How many eggs was it, then? How many?\" The doctors seemed extremely pleased with my batch, adding that omnipresent \"for your age\". The average retrieval, I later discovered, is 10. I staggered home, leaving my reproductive process behind me. Little bits of him and me were in dishes in a lab, as if it had nothing to do with us at all. The embryologist phoned the next day to say that all eight eggs had fertilised. I didn't ask if this was average \"for my age\". Soon there would be five or six cells in each dish.

But most of all, teenagers will identify with young Arthur, dreamer, poet and child on the brink of adulthood whose personal confusions and struggles to find out who he is and control his own destiny find him increasingly caught up with his namesake, King Arthur, the once and future king. </p> <p><strong> How to buy the books</strong><br> </p> <p> Off the shelf is a monthly selection of the best new titles.

So he becomes a copy cub, doing the things that big lions do. Hugging like Giggly Gorilla is OK, trying to fly like Round Brown Owl proves a bit of a mistake. </p> <p>There are delicious pictures so cute you want to gobble them up, and a text that rolls off the tongue. But what really makes this book different is an interactive element - your little copycats are encouraged to copy little copy cub. This book is much too exciting for bedtime but perfect for those what-shall-we-do-now? moments and a reminder that the real pleasure of books has nothing to do with decoding text and everything to do with fun. </p> <p> <strong> Through the Magic Mirror </strong> by Anthony Browne (Walker, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99, plus 99p p&amp;p) </p> <p> Toby is fed up and bored. His parents are either reading the paper or slumped in front of the TV. Then he walks through the mirror and is suddenly in a strange, surreal world where trees grow on top of buildings, dogs take their owners for walks, painters change the sky from day to night and flocks of choirboys fly overhead. </p> <p>Browne's visually stunning book owes much to Magritte and Dali, but also has its own unique take on a world where everything is topsy-turvy, from the living room where Toby's parents appear all but dead, to the cat being chased by a gang of mice. This is one of those books that makes you view the world differently, and offers loads to discuss. </p> <p> <strong> Do Not Read This Book </strong> by Pat Moon (Orchard, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99 plus 99p p&amp;p) </p> <p> Finch lives with her mum, her adopted gran and the world's most intelligent rabbit, Graeme. She worries about her gran's smoking, the size of her chest, why God might be a she and whether she and her best friend will be in the same class when they start school. Most of all she is worried about Action Man, her mum's boyfriend. </p> <p>This cunning little book captures the emotional intensity of being almost, but not quite, adolescent. Its diary format gradually reveals the manipulative possibilities of words and the way truth can be skewed. Girls who have read the complete Jacqueline Wilson oeuvre are likely to feel as passionate about this book as they do about transferable body art, saving the planet and beanie babies. </p> <p> <strong> Dosh</strong> by Robert Swindells (Puffin, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99, delivery free) </p> <p> Child labour, exploitation and racketeering are the subject of Swindells' enjoyable novel that takes place in Britain here and now. </p> <p>Most of the kids at Cottoncroft comp have part-time jobs, and they all know that 10% of their meagre earnings must be paid to Push, a gang of schoolkids controlled by small-time racketeer, Froggy Flitcroft. With the adults around them preferring to turn a blind eye, the teenagers find themselves pushed too far and start up a resistance organisation, Pull. </p> <p>Swindells doesn't shirk from depicting the fear, bruises and the bloodletting as the kids seek justice, and the message is potent: stick together and maybe you will beat the bullies who make your life a misery. </p> <p> <strong> Avocado Baby</strong> by John Burningham (Red Fox, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99, delivery free) </p> <p> New edition of 1982 classic that no household with children should be without. The Hargreaves are a family of weaklings and when their new baby arrives they fear it will also be weak. But when they start feeding it avocado pears, the baby gets stronger and stronger and is soon seeing off burglars and bullies. They have to put a notice on the gate saying: \"Beware of the baby\". </p> <p>There is plenty of amusement for adults and children in Burningham's dead-pan tone, and there is something wonderfully liberating about a story in which the smallest member of the family is the strongest. The very least it will do is make everyone laugh and persuade the whole family to sample avocados. </p> <p> <strong> The Hollyhock Wall </strong> by Martin Waddell, illustrated by Salley Mavor (Walker, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99, delivery free) </p> <p> Mary has no garden to play in so she makes her own out of an old cooking pot. She puts in a strip of blue ribbon for a stream, a bridge made from matches and paints a hollyhock wall around the rim of the pot. Then she makes Tom, a little boy of clay, to put in the garden. </p> <p>Then, when Mary goes to bed, she finds herself in the garden with Tom. During a game Tom goes over the wall and out of the garden. Will she find him again? There are echoes in this strange, unsettling and enchanting story of classics such as Marianne Dreams, but it makes its own links between the conscious and unconscious, and Mavor's tactile collage-style illustrations cast their own spell. </p> <p> <strong> The Doomspell</strong> by Cliff McNish (Orion, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99 plus 99p p&amp;p) </p> <p> This is a gripping yarn about Rachel and her brother who are pulled through the cellar wall into a world ruled by the evil Dragwena, a witch with four sets of teeth when one would be quite enough. </p> <p>What follows is a struggle between good and evil as the children find that they have unexpected powers and become the hope of all Dragwena's victims who dream of overthrowing her. </p> <p>The writing is racy, not refined, and the situations and characters are familiar from every fantasy novel since Lucy went through the wardrobe and found Narnia.

But it's vital that parents still have a say, because it's no good for a child to be choosing chips five times a week - we all know that wouldn't be good for them. It's fine for parents to let children make the choice, as long as there's a real attempt to educate them. We know children's eating habits improve when they are taught about healthy eating, but the message has to be real to them - they need to know they'll look better and feel fitter now, not that they'll get cancer in 20 years.<br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong> Richard Woolfson</strong> Psychologist and author of From Birth to Starting School </p> <p>There's a difference between listening to what your children have to say, and giving them responsibility for making the decision. There's nothing wrong in asking their opinion - in fact, it's an important part of educating them in how to make decisions. But from what I've read, this survey isn't telling us whether children are being consulted, or are actually making decisions. If it's the latter, there is something wrong: family life isn't about giving power to the kids, it's about teaching them to develop strategies for dealing with what life throws at them.<br>Verdict: Possibly</p> <p><strong> Kate Calvert</strong> Editor of Family Travel magazine </p> <p>I know some parents let their children make the decision about where to go on holiday, but I think giving kids carte blanche is a mistake. By all means let your children have a say, but make it within certain parameters: choose a handful of holidays you'd be happy with and ask for their views on which would suit them best. Just saying 'where do you want to go' opens the floodgates for a fortnight in a theme park, and who wants that? Listening to them is important, though - and serious objections need to be taken into account.<br>Verdict: Yes</p> <p><strong> Caroline d'Auria</strong> Mother of 10-year-old Charlie and Rowan, 19 months </p> <p>When I was a child I wasn't given a choice about, for example, what I was getting for lunch, and it didn't do me any harm - in fact I think it was a good thing, and stopped children getting too fussy. I don't give Charlie choices over food - obviously I wouldn't cook anything he hated, but I don't ask him what he wants either. If you do that you're making a rod for your own back. Life is all about living within boundaries and knowing there are limitations, and if children don't get that message I don't think you're preparing them well for adult life.<br>Verdict: Yes</p> <p><strong> Kate Green</strong> Director of the National Council for One Parent Families </p> <p>Lone parent families are among the poorest of all families, so for many there just isn't the option to give their children a choice about where to go on holiday, what car to buy or even what to eat. But they work hard to give their children a say where they can. They tell us that one of the hardest things about bringing up children on their own is not having an adult to share decision-making, but they know they have to tread carefully so as not to treat their children as substitute adults. They know there are some decisions that have to be taken by an adult.<br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong> Michele Elliott</strong> Director of Kidscape, author of 501 Ways to be a Good Parent </p> <p>The final decision on these issues must rest with the parents, and if the children are making them that's wrong. If it's a financial decision - such as where to go on holiday or what car to buy - then it seems only right that the parents make it, as they're the ones who are shelling out. If you're a parent, you sometimes have to make a decision that your children aren't happy with - and that's just life. Asking their views is one thing, but asking them to make big decisions at a young age is quite scary for them - they need guidance, and that has to come from you.<br>Verdict: Yes</p>",

We know children's eating habits improve when they are taught about healthy eating, but the message has to be real to them - they need to know they'll look better and feel fitter now, not that they'll get cancer in 20 years. Verdict: No Richard Woolfson Psychologist and author of From Birth to Starting School There's a difference between listening to what your children have to say, and giving them responsibility for making the decision. There's nothing wrong in asking their opinion - in fact, it's an important part of educating them in how to make decisions. But from what I've read, this survey isn't telling us whether children are being consulted, or are actually making decisions. If it's the latter, there is something wrong: family life isn't about giving power to the kids, it's about teaching them to develop strategies for dealing with what life throws at them. Verdict: Possibly Kate Calvert Editor of Family Travel magazine I know some parents let their children make the decision about where to go on holiday, but I think giving kids carte blanche is a mistake. By all means let your children have a say, but make it within certain parameters: choose a handful of holidays you'd be happy with and ask for their views on which would suit them best. Just saying 'where do you want to go' opens the floodgates for a fortnight in a theme park, and who wants that? Listening to them is important, though - and serious objections need to be taken into account. Verdict: Yes Caroline d'Auria Mother of 10-year-old Charlie and Rowan, 19 months When I was a child I wasn't given a choice about, for example, what I was getting for lunch, and it didn't do me any harm - in fact I think it was a good thing, and stopped children getting too fussy. I don't give Charlie choices over food - obviously I wouldn't cook anything he hated, but I don't ask him what he wants either. If you do that you're making a rod for your own back. Life is all about living within boundaries and knowing there are limitations, and if children don't get that message I don't think you're preparing them well for adult life. Verdict: Yes Kate Green Director of the National Council for One Parent Families Lone parent families are among the poorest of all families, so for many there just isn't the option to give their children a choice about where to go on holiday, what car to buy or even what to eat. But they work hard to give their children a say where they can. They tell us that one of the hardest things about bringing up children on their own is not having an adult to share decision-making, but they know they have to tread carefully so as not to treat their children as substitute adults. They know there are some decisions that have to be taken by an adult. Verdict: No Michele Elliott Director of Kidscape, author of 501 Ways to be a Good Parent The final decision on these issues must rest with the parents, and if the children are making them that's wrong. If it's a financial decision - such as where to go on holiday or what car to buy - then it seems only right that the parents make it, as they're the ones who are shelling out. If you're a parent, you sometimes have to make a decision that your children aren't happy with - and that's just life. Asking their views is one thing, but asking them to make big decisions at a young age is quite scary for them - they need guidance, and that has to come from you. Verdict: Yes",

For \"legal\" reasons, the trust will not explain why it cancelled the contract, or even who the contractor was. It will only say it withheld the cash because the company was \"not meeting the contract requirements\". </p> <p>Nick Bradley, a regional official for the public services union, Unison, which represents staff at the laundry, believes the penalty was triggered by a collapse in service quality. He claims: \"The laundry was not being delivered at the right time, or in the right quantity. In some cases the 'clean' laundry still had blood and faeces on it.\" </p> <p>Zac Barratt, a director of Summit Group, was involved with Summit Laundry Services - now in liquidation - which ran the contract. He refused to discuss why the contract was cancelled. \"I know why the contract was cancelled, but that's a matter for us and the trust,\" he said. </p> <p>The Basildon case illustrates what many in NHS management are beginning finally to recognise: that privatisation is not a infallible cure for service inefficiencies; and that the relentless drive towards ever greater cost savings through contracting out has, in many cases, had a disastrous effect on service quality. </p> <p>Recently, the NHS Confederation - trusts in membership of which have contracted out hundreds of millions of pounds of support services over the past 17 years - admitted that cost-cutting had directly led to the filthy NHS wards, dirty bed linen and inedible hospital food of public infamy. If the government's NHS modernisation plan was to work, it warned, the service would have to get the \"basics\" right. This meant providing clean wards, clean laundry, nutritious food for patients and proper training and personal development for support staff - even at the expense of \"efficiency\" savings. </p> <p>Stephen Thornton, the confederation's chief executive, says: \"In one hospital in the south-east, for example, there was an average of 131 duty hours available to clean each ward in 1982. Today there are only 70 hours. This is not untypical of the effect of market testing and reduced budgets.\" </p> <p>A recent ministerial statement revealed that, over the past three years, private companies which have been contracted to provide support services to the NHS - including pharmacy and information technology, as well as ancillary services - have incurred more than \u00a32m in penalties triggered by failure to meet performance standards. </p> <p>The biggest group - just over a third - of the 63 penalties over that period involve ancillary services. These ranged from a \u00a3520 fine slapped on a private security firm by East Somerset trust, to \u00a351,000 relating to a laundry contract let by Hinchingbrooke Health Care trust, Cambridgeshire. </p> <p>A further 10 contracts for support services - mainly cleaning and laundry - at trusts across England were simply terminated, in the words of the minister, for \"failure to perform to time or to standard\". </p> <p>In the case of Basildon, the trust claims it went through \"a very detailed and robust tendering process\" before awarding the contract to the company involved. It says: \"The contract was awarded to them for all the right reasons - quality and value for money.\" Asked why its robust process evidently failed, a trust spokeswoman said: \"Clearly we had no reason to believe they were not going to perform on quality and to standard.\" </p> <p>The trust has confirmed that the laundry contract was subsequently awarded to the company that had offered the next lowest price in the original tendering process. </p> <p>Nick Bradley doubts that trusts can afford to pay for quality: \"There's a lot of verbiage talked about the commitment to quality,\" he says. \"The problem is that there are such financial pressures, it [the tendering process] is driven by cost much more than quality.\" </p> <p>Norman Rose, spokesman for the Business Services Association (BSA), which represents contractors in the support services industry, admits that NHS contracts have been bedevilled by what he calls \"a stereotyped type of contract based on the lowest price\". He believes that support services contracts are now increasingly geared to quality and that relationships between trusts and the private sector have improved over the past three years because there is a \"better understanding of what each side is looking for\". </p> <p>Rose adds: \"If over the last three years there have been only 50 to 60 contracts penalised, it shows that the public and private sectors are working well together.\" </p> <p>Bradley believes that the 63 recorded contract penalties are the tip of the iceberg. In his experience, he says, trusts are notoriously bad at monitoring quality, and even when problems are identified, do not act. \"It's got to be pretty dire before they do anything about it,\" he claims. </p> <p>Rose believes that the cause of poor quality, particularly among contracted-out ancillary work, is low pay and poor working conditions. He says: \"These services are highly labour intensive; the biggest area of expenditure is on labour. How do you get a quality service if you are spending less money on labour?\" </p> <p>The government's failure to stop privatisation of NHS support services has enraged health unions. Under the private finance initiative for hospital building, some \u00a3500m in service contracts has gone to private companies in the past three years, according to the BSA. Unions, if not all private contractors, are hopeful that imminent government plans to introduce new guidelines on contracting out - under the working title \"better value\" and based on the \"best value\" system in local government - will help put quality, rather than lowest price, centre stage. </p> <p>This would squeeze contractors' profit margins even more. But Unison's national officer, Steven Weeks, believes it could force up standards - and not just because it might lead to more cleaning, catering and laundry services being brought back into the NHS. </p> <p>\"Where contractors can bundle together contracts [across trusts], there is still scope for them - especially if they are prepared to take a long-term view, rather than year-on-year savings,\" says Weeks. </p> <p>\"It will put contractors under a lot of pressure, but this will drive out the cowboys.\" </p> <p> <strong>Broken trust</strong><br></p> <p>According to Hansard - the parliamentary record - penalties for failure to perform to time or to standard include \u00a3400,000 relating to a contract to provide agency nurses at St George's Healthcare trust, south London. </p> <p>The trust refuses to confirm the figure or discuss why the penalty has been levied. Nor will it name the company that held the contract. It merely says \"ongoing discussions\" are taking place with the contractor. </p> <p>Unofficial sources at the trust suggest that the contract related to supply of up to 200 agency nurses a day, at a cost of about \u00a3150 each, to St George's, which, in common with other hospitals in the south-east, has found it difficult to recruit enough staff. </p> <p>The British Nursing Association, one of the largest nursing agencies, held a large contract with St George's during the period in question. Its managing director, Mike Horgan, confirms that it is \"talking to the trust\" about outstanding issues relating to the contract. But he says he knows nothing of any penalty clause. \"We have never had a dispute with this trust in regard to quality or performance. We behave in line with the requirements of the contract.\" </p> <p>Other penalties cited in Hansard include \u00a3461,000 paid out by an unnamed firm which ran an energy maintenance system at Havering Hospitals trust, Essex.</p>",

This is not untypical of the effect of market testing and reduced budgets.\" A recent ministerial statement revealed that, over the past three years, private companies which have been contracted to provide support services to the NHS - including pharmacy and information technology, as well as ancillary services - have incurred more than \u00a32m in penalties triggered by failure to meet performance standards. The biggest group - just over a third - of the 63 penalties over that period involve ancillary services. These ranged from a \u00a3520 fine slapped on a private security firm by East Somerset trust, to \u00a351,000 relating to a laundry contract let by Hinchingbrooke Health Care trust, Cambridgeshire. A further 10 contracts for support services - mainly cleaning and laundry - at trusts across England were simply terminated, in the words of the minister, for \"failure to perform to time or to standard\". In the case of Basildon, the trust claims it went through \"a very detailed and robust tendering process\" before awarding the contract to the company involved. It says: \"The contract was awarded to them for all the right reasons - quality and value for money.\" Asked why its robust process evidently failed, a trust spokeswoman said: \"Clearly we had no reason to believe they were not going to perform on quality and to standard.\" The trust has confirmed that the laundry contract was subsequently awarded to the company that had offered the next lowest price in the original tendering process. Nick Bradley doubts that trusts can afford to pay for quality: \"There's a lot of verbiage talked about the commitment to quality,\" he says. \"The problem is that there are such financial pressures, it [the tendering process] is driven by cost much more than quality.\" Norman Rose, spokesman for the Business Services Association (BSA), which represents contractors in the support services industry, admits that NHS contracts have been bedevilled by what he calls \"a stereotyped type of contract based on the lowest price\". He believes that support services contracts are now increasingly geared to quality and that relationships between trusts and the private sector have improved over the past three years because there is a \"better understanding of what each side is looking for\". Rose adds: \"If over the last three years there have been only 50 to 60 contracts penalised, it shows that the public and private sectors are working well together.\" Bradley believes that the 63 recorded contract penalties are the tip of the iceberg. In his experience, he says, trusts are notoriously bad at monitoring quality, and even when problems are identified, do not act. \"It's got to be pretty dire before they do anything about it,\" he claims. Rose believes that the cause of poor quality, particularly among contracted-out ancillary work, is low pay and poor working conditions. He says: \"These services are highly labour intensive; the biggest area of expenditure is on labour. How do you get a quality service if you are spending less money on labour?\" The government's failure to stop privatisation of NHS support services has enraged health unions. Under the private finance initiative for hospital building, some \u00a3500m in service contracts has gone to private companies in the past three years, according to the BSA. Unions, if not all private contractors, are hopeful that imminent government plans to introduce new guidelines on contracting out - under the working title \"better value\" and based on the \"best value\" system in local government - will help put quality, rather than lowest price, centre stage. This would squeeze contractors' profit margins even more. But Unison's national officer, Steven Weeks, believes it could force up standards - and not just because it might lead to more cleaning, catering and laundry services being brought back into the NHS. \"Where contractors can bundle together contracts [across trusts], there is still scope for them - especially if they are prepared to take a long-term view, rather than year-on-year savings,\" says Weeks. \"It will put contractors under a lot of pressure, but this will drive out the cowboys.\" Broken trust According to Hansard - the parliamentary record - penalties for failure to perform to time or to standard include \u00a3400,000 relating to a contract to provide agency nurses at St George's Healthcare trust, south London. The trust refuses to confirm the figure or discuss why the penalty has been levied. Nor will it name the company that held the contract. It merely says \"ongoing discussions\" are taking place with the contractor. Unofficial sources at the trust suggest that the contract related to supply of up to 200 agency nurses a day, at a cost of about \u00a3150 each, to St George's, which, in common with other hospitals in the south-east, has found it difficult to recruit enough staff. The British Nursing Association, one of the largest nursing agencies, held a large contract with St George's during the period in question. Its managing director, Mike Horgan, confirms that it is \"talking to the trust\" about outstanding issues relating to the contract. But he says he knows nothing of any penalty clause. \"We have never had a dispute with this trust in regard to quality or performance. We behave in line with the requirements of the contract.\" Other penalties cited in Hansard include \u00a3461,000 paid out by an unnamed firm which ran an energy maintenance system at Havering Hospitals trust, Essex.",

They work to the treasury and have recently been asked to extend their role for at least a further two years. </p> <p>Today's report, Public Services Productivity: Meeting the Challenge, says productivity in the private sector has been growing at about 2% a year. There are no comparable figures for the public sector because of the difficulty putting a monetary value on service outcomes, but if productivity in creased by 3%, public services would benefit to the tune of \u00a36.3bn a year. </p> <p>\"Without freeing up resources to invest in priorities, public services will stand still, fail to meet user expectations and slow economic growth,\" says the report. \"So productivity will be a deciding factor in the success or failure of our public services and our economy as a whole in the 21st century.\" </p> <p>The panel's influence is hard to gauge, particularly as it stresses that it does not want its recommendations to burden services with the requirement of \"a new set of action plans or reports\".

His observations in today's report will undoubtedly be read closely across Whitehall. </p> <p>Culture change, he writes, is a marathon rather than a sprint. Improvement \"will only be captured by intense commitment to change, both in the civil service leadership and through the system and in the government political management process\". Change in the latter demands focused objectives - \"there are currently too many and they change often\" - as well as more consistent leadership by the cabinet, and clearer delegation to junior ministers, to define priorities for civil servants. </p> <p>\"The process by which cabinet government develops effective policy, and the civil service and executive agencies work to achieve improving results, is both complex and currently inadequately co-ordinated and reviewed,\" Simon declares. </p> <p>The report sets out a performance management framework for the public services, based on five building blocks: \"bold\" aspirations, a coherent set of measures and targets, ownership and accountability, rigorous performance review and reinforcement - the latter to mean \"real consequences at an individual level\" for success and failure.

Unison also voted to join at its national conference. \"The letter is based on insufficient knowledge and understanding of the issues,\" says a spokesperson for Unison, which has also published a report on GM crops and food production. \"The report reflects our policy of support for the campaign, and a policy which is sceptical about the claims made by the GM companies about their technology. Livermore is unrepentant. \"We are not going to get acceptance of the technology without trying to build bridges. I feel it was worthwhile as an individual to make contacts to see if we could get dialogue going.\"",

      "byline": "John Cunningham",

      "body": "<p>A new way of bringing assurance to rural areas, where village bobbies are rarely seen and patrol cars have to cover huge distances, is being successfully pioneered by Lincolnshire police. They are using a converted camper van for two-day and three-day visits to market towns to show people that the force is still with them. </p> <p>The initiative comes amid fears of rising crime in a part of the country where locals, faced with a burglar or a poacher, sometimes take the law into their own hands. </p> <p>Although Brian Ward's farm is within a mile of a market town with a police station, at Louth, it is isolated by dirt tracks and drainage dykes. When poachers turned up one night to hunt foxes - mesmerising them with a spotlight, then letting dogs loose - Ward reckoned police help would take too long to arrive. Instead of dialling 999, he tried to frighten off the trespassers with his air rifle. A warning shot hit one of them. In June, Ward was acquitted of unlawful wounding, though the judge said firing the gun had been an \"extremely stupid\" thing to do. </p> <p>In another instance of citizen action, again questionable, two Kosovan refugees from a hostel in Skegness were apprehended breaking into houses in the village of Markby. According to one resident, they were \"well roughed up\" by the locals who caught them. </p> <p>With police thin on the ground, as in many rural areas, Lincolnshire has become a vigilant county: it abounds with neighbourhood watches, car watches, farm watches. Around fenny Boston, where illegal coursing is rife, there is even a leveret watch, with 80 farmers protecting 50,000 acres and the resident young hares. </p> <p>People living in small places lucky enough still to have a police station need to check the local paper for opening times, typically limited to a few hours a day. So it is in Louth and nearby Alford, which are among the places where the novel substitute for the beat bobby is being tried out. </p> <p>Since the spring, with Home Office funding, a police camper van crewed by a sergeant and five PCs has been on a circuit of 10 market centres. Several other forces are interested in the project and its success will be analysed at a rural policing conference being hosted by Lincolnshire in November. </p> <p>So far, the mobile unit operates only in the east of the county. However, Chief Superintendent Peter Davies, in charge of the east division, says the Home Office has been impressed and funds for 41 more officers have been promised. </p> <p>\"Most people assume Lincolnshire is a quiet backwater, and 95% of the time it is,\" says Davies. But along with the car crime, drugs and domestic disputes, there are big dramas. The only instance of a death caused by a letter bomb in the past 25 years, outside Northern Ireland, occurred not so long ago in Louth.

      "bodyText": "A new way of bringing assurance to rural areas, where village bobbies are rarely seen and patrol cars have to cover huge distances, is being successfully pioneered by Lincolnshire police. They are using a converted camper van for two-day and three-day visits to market towns to show people that the force is still with them. The initiative comes amid fears of rising crime in a part of the country where locals, faced with a burglar or a poacher, sometimes take the law into their own hands. Although Brian Ward's farm is within a mile of a market town with a police station, at Louth, it is isolated by dirt tracks and drainage dykes. When poachers turned up one night to hunt foxes - mesmerising them with a spotlight, then letting dogs loose - Ward reckoned police help would take too long to arrive. Instead of dialling 999, he tried to frighten off the trespassers with his air rifle. A warning shot hit one of them. In June, Ward was acquitted of unlawful wounding, though the judge said firing the gun had been an \"extremely stupid\" thing to do. In another instance of citizen action, again questionable, two Kosovan refugees from a hostel in Skegness were apprehended breaking into houses in the village of Markby. According to one resident, they were \"well roughed up\" by the locals who caught them. With police thin on the ground, as in many rural areas, Lincolnshire has become a vigilant county: it abounds with neighbourhood watches, car watches, farm watches. Around fenny Boston, where illegal coursing is rife, there is even a leveret watch, with 80 farmers protecting 50,000 acres and the resident young hares. People living in small places lucky enough still to have a police station need to check the local paper for opening times, typically limited to a few hours a day. So it is in Louth and nearby Alford, which are among the places where the novel substitute for the beat bobby is being tried out. Since the spring, with Home Office funding, a police camper van crewed by a sergeant and five PCs has been on a circuit of 10 market centres. Several other forces are interested in the project and its success will be analysed at a rural policing conference being hosted by Lincolnshire in November. So far, the mobile unit operates only in the east of the county. However, Chief Superintendent Peter Davies, in charge of the east division, says the Home Office has been impressed and funds for 41 more officers have been promised. \"Most people assume Lincolnshire is a quiet backwater, and 95% of the time it is,\" says Davies. But along with the car crime, drugs and domestic disputes, there are big dramas. The only instance of a death caused by a letter bomb in the past 25 years, outside Northern Ireland, occurred not so long ago in Louth. Other offences fit more obviously with the profile of the area: rich, remote farm houses are targeted by thieves coming out from the inner cities; illegal immigrants from east Europe are supplied as cheap labour to local farms by unscrupulous gang-masters. With redeployment and reorganisation, the east division faced a shortage of beat officers and a surfeit of unhappy villagers able to name their local bobbies of years gone by. There was no question of a return to a golden era of plentiful policing - whether real or imagined - but new thinking was needed. Hence the van.

Research by the local health authority suggests that one in four 14 year olds has used illegal drugs, over a third are drinking alcohol once a week or more and a fifth are already smoking. </p> <p>Shot in the Dark is the brainchild of 35-year-old Steve Wright, who set up The Wright Stuff in 1992 after doing a puppet show at his local summer fete. \"Two old ladies knocked on the door one evening to ask whether I could do something for their fete, which was dead on its feet,\" he says. \"When my wife and I got married, we visited India and had bought lots of puppets in Rajasthan, so I decided to put on a puppet show.\" Inspired by the positive response to the show, Wright quit his job as a landscape gardener to become a full-time puppet maker and master. </p> <p>Two years ago, having established close links with local schools and community groups, Wright applied to the Home Office for a small grant to fund a drugs education pilot project. The result was Shot in the Dark, a travelling puppet show that uses Spitting Image-like characters such as Judge Dreadful and Buzz Lingo to present the issues surrounding drugs culture and young people.

      "bodyText": "Punch and Judy shows may not exactly have paved the way for using puppets as agents of social change, but an innovative project by a West Yorkshire puppet theatre company to help local schools promote anti-drugs messages today receives a \u00a3276,000 lottery grant to tackle teenage health issues. Drugs tsar Keith Hellawell has been among those to praise The Wright Stuff's drug awareness programme, Shot in the Dark, which is aimed at 13 and 14 year olds living in Kirklees. Research by the local health authority suggests that one in four 14 year olds has used illegal drugs, over a third are drinking alcohol once a week or more and a fifth are already smoking. Shot in the Dark is the brainchild of 35-year-old Steve Wright, who set up The Wright Stuff in 1992 after doing a puppet show at his local summer fete. \"Two old ladies knocked on the door one evening to ask whether I could do something for their fete, which was dead on its feet,\" he says. \"When my wife and I got married, we visited India and had bought lots of puppets in Rajasthan, so I decided to put on a puppet show.\" Inspired by the positive response to the show, Wright quit his job as a landscape gardener to become a full-time puppet maker and master. Two years ago, having established close links with local schools and community groups, Wright applied to the Home Office for a small grant to fund a drugs education pilot project. The result was Shot in the Dark, a travelling puppet show that uses Spitting Image-like characters such as Judge Dreadful and Buzz Lingo to present the issues surrounding drugs culture and young people. The performance takes the form of a game show, with the story line highlighting the costs - physical and financial - and the side effects of drug abuse. \"My character, Buzz shows the implications of getting a criminal record - risks to career or travel plans, for example,\" Wright says. Another character calculates that the cost of smoking until his mid-50s is \u00a3100,000 - equivalent to buying a house. \"If you dissect issues like smoking from a financial angle, you get young people to look at them in a different way,\" Wright says.

The government is committed to cutting use by young people of drugs \"which cause the most harm\" by a quarter by 2005 and by half by 2008.

Yes, sometimes something as petty as that. </p> <p>They were the far-off days, more than a quarter of a century ago, when the old ministry of labour traditionally acted as mediator whenever key pay negotiations between management and unions broke down and the national interest was supposedly threatened. Labour disputes were a familiar part of the industrial landscape, an almost everyday occurrence, and their progress was greedily witnessed by the media during countless day and night negotiations at St James's Square. </p> <p>With both sides exhausted after endless nights of fish and chip suppers, Castle's chief spokesman would slip down to utter the immortal phrase - unacceptable and unthinkable today, of course - \"Gentlemen, the Chinese electrician is at work.\" He meant there was a \"chink of light\" and the government had got a deal. </p> <p>It was a situation that could not last. Successive ministers grew grizzled and grey in the job and Harold Wilson's incoming Labour government in March 1974 finally decided to act, having seen Ted Heath's Conservatives brought down by the miners after imposing a three-day working week. Thus was born the Conciliation and Arbitration Service - better known, after Advisory was later put at the front of the already clumsy title, as Acas - an organisation designed by Labour to establish an independent role that would remove the government from pay bargaining. </p> <p>The first 25 years of Acas are recalled in a new book, Employment Relations in Britain, edited by Brian Towers and William Brown, which analyses the organisation's contribution to greater harmony and understanding in the workplace. The conclusion of Towers and Brown, professors of industrial relations at Nottingham Business School and Cambridge University respectively, is that Acas contributed significantly towards reducing labour conflicts. </p> <p>Acas is one of the last relics of tripartite institutions set up by Labour under the Wilson government. Both the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) put forward representatives who nominally reported to the employment secretary of the day. At the outset, ministers had some influence, largely due to the fact that Acas often had to operate within the limits of government pay policies, but over the years such external shackles have been removed. </p> <p>Union leaders such as Jack Jones, of the transport workers, and Bill Simpson, a Labour Party chairman, were among those instrumental in setting up Acas. Its chairmen have been an ex-civil servant, a union leader, and several captains of industry, all renowned for their patience and industrial sagacity. They have included Pat Lowry, former head of personnel at British Leyland, and, more recently, John Hougham, who held a similar post at Ford. </p> <p>In the early days, Acas occupied up-market offices in St James's Square. Then it was moved to new quarters in the National Coal Board (NCB), opposite the gardens of Buckingham Palace. It currently occupies more modest premises near London Bridge. Ironically, when it arrived at the NCB, it took over the coffin-shaped Room 16 - scene of countless showdowns between the board and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). It was the room where Sir Ian MacGregor, appointed by Margaret Thatcher as NCB chairman to bring down the NUM, confronted union president Arthur Scargill across the table, deliberately sparking the year-long miners' strike of 1984-85. </p> <p>During that historic strike, Acas was used by both sides to try to engineer a settlement. Its failure to end the misery of tens of thousands of miners, hastening the collapse of the coal industry, was the fault not of its conciliators, but of the intransigence of the government of the day. Thatcher instructed MacGregor not to settle - and an astonished nation observed the NCB's chairman escaping from Acas headquarters with a paper bag over his head in an attempt to look inconspicuous. </p> <p>Today, it may seem difficult to understand the obsessive nature of the media's interest in industrial relations during the 1970s and 1980s. But strikes were front page news even after the birth of an independent force such as Acas. A little local dispute, or a train drivers' work to rule at London Waterloo, were often portrayed as national disasters and gave the impression overseas of a strike-happy Britain. </p> <p>But Acas was always there, a safe pair of hands, offering sanctuary and common sense to those who called for help. In all the important industrial upheavals of the past decades, it has been a quiet backdrop to events which sometimes got dangerously out of control. </p> <p>Nowhere was this more evident than the 1978-79 \"winter of discontent\" which eventually did for the Labour government of Jim Callaghan, presaging the arrival of Thatcher and her popular mandate to introduce union reform. Acas's lights burned long into the night while rubbish mounted in the streets and hospitals were picketed, all because a smiling Callaghan obstinately stuck to a 5% pay limit. In the middle of the mayhem, he returned to the country after a heads of government conference in the West Indies and was famously reported as asking: \"Crisis - what crisis?\" Within months, he had been dumped by the electorate, while Acas went on against the odds to survive the Thatcher years - albeit uneasily at times. </p> <p>Since Acas was established, as Towers and Brown point out, strikes have tumbled from the highest to the lowest levels ever recorded in Britain. Coverage of collective bargaining has halved and union membership has fallen by more than a third. Yet demand for Acas's services is greater than ever. Its energies are now devoted more to anticipating industrial disputes at an earlier stage - conciliation in disputes not having fallen in line with strikes - and to conciliating in individual cases. The number of the latter has almost tripled since 1979. Moreover, Acas staff are as busy as ever in propagating sound practice at the workplace. </p> <p>There may never again be any need for ministers to spend countless hours in crumpled suits, on a diet of fish and chips, waiting for that elusive chink of light. But \"going to Acas\" will continue to hold a special place in the lexicon of British working life. </p> <p>Keith Harper was the Guardian's labour editor from 1975 to 1995.

Its chairmen have been an ex-civil servant, a union leader, and several captains of industry, all renowned for their patience and industrial sagacity. They have included Pat Lowry, former head of personnel at British Leyland, and, more recently, John Hougham, who held a similar post at Ford. In the early days, Acas occupied up-market offices in St James's Square. Then it was moved to new quarters in the National Coal Board (NCB), opposite the gardens of Buckingham Palace. It currently occupies more modest premises near London Bridge. Ironically, when it arrived at the NCB, it took over the coffin-shaped Room 16 - scene of countless showdowns between the board and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). It was the room where Sir Ian MacGregor, appointed by Margaret Thatcher as NCB chairman to bring down the NUM, confronted union president Arthur Scargill across the table, deliberately sparking the year-long miners' strike of 1984-85. During that historic strike, Acas was used by both sides to try to engineer a settlement. Its failure to end the misery of tens of thousands of miners, hastening the collapse of the coal industry, was the fault not of its conciliators, but of the intransigence of the government of the day. Thatcher instructed MacGregor not to settle - and an astonished nation observed the NCB's chairman escaping from Acas headquarters with a paper bag over his head in an attempt to look inconspicuous. Today, it may seem difficult to understand the obsessive nature of the media's interest in industrial relations during the 1970s and 1980s. But strikes were front page news even after the birth of an independent force such as Acas. A little local dispute, or a train drivers' work to rule at London Waterloo, were often portrayed as national disasters and gave the impression overseas of a strike-happy Britain. But Acas was always there, a safe pair of hands, offering sanctuary and common sense to those who called for help. In all the important industrial upheavals of the past decades, it has been a quiet backdrop to events which sometimes got dangerously out of control. Nowhere was this more evident than the 1978-79 \"winter of discontent\" which eventually did for the Labour government of Jim Callaghan, presaging the arrival of Thatcher and her popular mandate to introduce union reform. Acas's lights burned long into the night while rubbish mounted in the streets and hospitals were picketed, all because a smiling Callaghan obstinately stuck to a 5% pay limit. In the middle of the mayhem, he returned to the country after a heads of government conference in the West Indies and was famously reported as asking: \"Crisis - what crisis?\" Within months, he had been dumped by the electorate, while Acas went on against the odds to survive the Thatcher years - albeit uneasily at times. Since Acas was established, as Towers and Brown point out, strikes have tumbled from the highest to the lowest levels ever recorded in Britain. Coverage of collective bargaining has halved and union membership has fallen by more than a third. Yet demand for Acas's services is greater than ever. Its energies are now devoted more to anticipating industrial disputes at an earlier stage - conciliation in disputes not having fallen in line with strikes - and to conciliating in individual cases. The number of the latter has almost tripled since 1979. Moreover, Acas staff are as busy as ever in propagating sound practice at the workplace. There may never again be any need for ministers to spend countless hours in crumpled suits, on a diet of fish and chips, waiting for that elusive chink of light. But \"going to Acas\" will continue to hold a special place in the lexicon of British working life. Keith Harper was the Guardian's labour editor from 1975 to 1995.

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Chapter one:  Kindling </strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Chapter one: Kindling </strong></p> <p>It was the middle of August and Myers was between lives. The only thing different about this time from the other times was that this time he was sober. He'd just spent twenty-eight days at a drying-out facility. But during this period his wife took it into her head to go down the road with another drunk, a friend of theirs. The man had recently come into some money and had been talking about buying into a bar and restaurant in the eastern part of the state. </p> <p> Myers called his wife, but she hung up on him. She wouldn't even talk to him, let alone have him anywhere near the house. She had a lawyer and a restraining order. So he took a few things, boarded a bus, and went to live near the ocean in a room in a house owned by a man named Sol who had run an ad in the paper. </p> <p> Sol was wearing jeans and a red T-shirt when he opened the door. It was about ten o'clock at night and Myers had just gotten out of a cab. Under the porch light Myers could see that Sol's right arm was shorter than his other arm, and the hand and fingers were withered, He didn't offer either his good left hand or his withered hand for Myers to shake, and this was fine with Myers. Myers felt plenty rattled as it was. </p> <p> You just called, right? Sol said. You're here to see the room. Come on in. </p> <p> Myers gripped his suitcase and stepped inside. </p> <p> This is my wife. This is Bonnie, Sol said. </p> <p> Bonnie was watching TV but moved her eyes to see who it was coming inside. She pushed the button on a device she held in her hand and the volume went off. She pushed it again and the picture disappeared. Then she got up off the sofa onto her feet. She was a fat girl. She was fat all over and she huffed when she breathed. </p> <p> I'm sorry it's so late, Myers said. Nice to meet you. </p> <p> It's all right, Bonnie said. Did my husband tell you on the phone what we're asking? </p> <p> Myers nodded. He was still holding the suitcase. </p> <p> Well, this is the living room; Sol said, as you can see for yourself. He shook his head and brought the fingers of his good hand up to his chin. I may as well tell you that we're new at this. We never rented a room to anybody before. But it's just back there not being used, and we thought what the hell. A person can always use a little extra. </p> <p> I don't blame you a bit, Myers said. </p> <p> Where are you from? Bonnie said. You're not from anywhere around town. </p> <p> My wife wants to be a writer, Sol said. Who, what, where, why, and how much? </p> <p> I just got here, Myers said. He moved the suitcase to his other hand. I got off the bus about an hour ago, read your ad in the paper, and called up. </p> <p> What sort of work do you do? Bonnie wanted to know. </p> <p> I've done everything, Myers said. He set the suitcase down and opened and closed his fingers. Then he picked up the suitcase again. </p> <p> Bonnie didn't pursue it. Sol didn't either, though Myers could see he was curious. Myers took in a photograph of Elvis Presley on top of the TV. Elvis's signature ran across the breast of his white sequined jacket. He moved a step closer. </p> <p> The King, Bonnie said. </p> <p> Myers nodded but didn't say anything. Alongside the picture of Elvis was a wedding picture of Sol and Bonnie. In the picture Sol was dressed up in a suit and tie. Sol's good strong left arm reached around Bonnie's waist as far as it would go. Sol's right hand and Bonnie's right hand were joined over Sol's belt buckle. Bonnie wasn't going anywhere if Sol had anything to say about it. Bonnie didn't mind. In the picture Bonnie wore a hat and was all smiles. </p> <p> I love her, Sol said, as if Myers had said something to the contrary. </p> <p> How about that room you were going to show me? Myers said. </p> <p> I knew there was something we were forgetting, Sol said. </p> <p> They moved out of the living room into the kitchen, Sol first, then Myers, carrying his suitcase, and then Bonnie. They passed through the kitchen and turned left just before the back door. There were some open cupboards along the wall, and a washer and dryer. Sol opened a door at the end of the little corridor and turned on the light in the bathroom. </p> <p> Bonnie moved up and huffed and said, This is your private bathroom. That door in the kitchen is your own entrance. </p> <p> Sol opened the door to the other side of the bathroom and turned on another light. This is the room, he said. </p> <p> I made up the bed with clean sheets, Bonnie said. But if you take the room you'll have to be responsible from here on out. </p> <p> Like my wife says, this is not a hotel, Sol said. But you're welcome, if you want to stay. </p> <p> There was a double bed against one wall, along with a nightstand and lamp, a chest of drawers, and a pinochle table with a metal chair. A big window gave out onto the backyard. Myers put his suitcase on the bed and moved to the window. He raised the shade and looked out. A moon rode high in the sky. In the distance he could see a forested valley and mountain peaks. Was it his imagination, or did he hear a stream or a river? </p> <p> I hear water, Myers said. </p> <p> That's the Little Quilcene River you hear, Sol said. That river has the fastest per-foot drop to it of any river in the country. </p> <p> Well, what do you think? Bonnie said. She went over and turned down the covers on the bed, and this simple gesture almost caused Myers to weep. </p> <p> I'll take it, Myers said. </p> <p> I'm glad, Sol said. My wife's glad too, I can tell. I'll have them pull that ad out of the paper tomorrow. You want to move in right now, don't you? </p> <p> That's what I hoped, Myers said. </p> <p> We'll let you get settled, Bonnie said. I gave you two pillows, and there's an extra quilt in that closet. </p> <p> Myers could only nod. </p> <p> Well, good night, Sol said. </p> <p> Good night, Bonnie said. </p> <p> Good night, Myers said. And thank you. </p> <p> Sol and Bonnie, went through his bathroom and into the kitchen. They closed the door, but not before Myers heard Bonnie say, He seems okay. </p> <p> Pretty quiet, Sol said. </p> <p> I think I'll fix buttered popcorn. </p> <p> I'll eat some with you, Sol said. </p> <p> Pretty soon Myers heard the TV come on again in the living room, but it was a very faint sound and he didn't think it would bother him. He opened the window all the way and heard the sound of the river as it raced through the valley on its way to the ocean. </p> <p> He took his things out of the suitcase and put them away in the drawers. Then he used the bathroom and brushed his teeth. He moved the table so that it sat directly in front of the window. Then he looked at where she'd turned the covers down. He drew out the metal chair and sat down and took a ballpoint out of his pocket. He thought for a minute, then opened the notebook, and at the top of a blank white page he wrote the words Emptiness is the beginning of all things. He stared at this, and then he laughed. Jesus, what rubbish! He shook his head. He closed the notebook, undressed, and turned off the light. He stood for a moment looking out the window and listening to the river. Then he moved to get into bed.</p> <p> * * * </p> <p>Bonnie fixed the popcorn, salted it and poured butter over it, and took it in a big bowl to where Sol was watching TV. She let him help himself to some first. He used his left hand to good effect and then he reached his little hand over for the paper towel she offered. She took a little popcorn for herself. </p> <p> What do you make of him? she wanted to know. Our new roomer. </p> <p> Sol shook his head and went on watching TV and eating popcorn. Then, as if he'd been thinking about her question, he said, I like him all right. He's okay. But I think he's on the run from something. </p> <p> What? </p> <p> I don't know that. I'm just guessing. He isn't dangerous and he isn't going to make any trouble. His eyes, Bonnie said. </p> <p> What about his eyes? </p> <p> They're sad eyes. Saddest eyes I ever saw on a man. </p> <p> Sol didn't say anything for a minute. He finished his popcorn. He wiped his fingers and dabbed his chin with the paper towel. He's okay. He's just had some trouble along the way, that's all. No disgrace attached to that. Give me a sip of that, will you? He reached over for the glass of orange drink she was holding and took some. You know, I forgot to collect the rent from him tonight. I'll have to get it in the morning, if he's up. And I should have asked him how long he intends to stay. Damn, what's wrong with me? I don't want to turn this place into a hotel. </p> <p> You couldn't think of everything. Besides, we're new at this. We never rented a room out before. </p> <p> Bonnie decided she was going to write about the man in the notebook she was filling up. She closed her eyes and thought about what she was going to write. This tall, stooped-but handsome!-curly headed stranger with sad eyes walked into our house one fateful night in August. She leaned into Sol's left arm and tried to write some more. Sol squeezed her shoulder, which brought her back to the present. She opened her eyes and closed them, but she couldn't think of anything else to write about him at the moment. Time will tell, she thought. She was glad he was here. </p> <p> This show's for the birds, Sol said. Let's go to bed. We have to get up in the morning. </p> <p> In bed, Sol loved her up and she took him and held him and loved him back, but all the time she was doing it she was thinking about the big, curly headed man in the back room. What if he suddenly opened the bedroom door and looked in on them? </p> <p> Sol, she said, is this bedroom door locked? </p> <p> What? Be still, Sol said. Then he finished and rolled off, but he kept his little arm on her breast. She lay on her back and thought for a minute, then she patted his fingers, let air out through her mouth, and went off to sleep thinking about blasting caps, which is what had gone off in Sol's hand when he was a teenager, severing nerves and causing his arm and fingers to wither. </p> <p> Bonnie began to snore. Sol took her arm and shook it until she turned over on her side, away from him. </p> <p> In a minute, he got up and put on his underwear. He went into the living room. He didn't turn on the light. He didn't need a light. The moon was out, and he didn't want a light. He went from the living room into the kitchen. He made sure the back door was locked, and then he stood for a while outside the bathroom door listening, but he couldn't hear anything out of the ordinary. The faucet dripped-it needed a washer, but then, it had always dripped. He went back through the house and closed and locked their bedroom door. He checked the clock and made sure the stem was pulled. He got into bed and moved right up against Bonnie. He put his leg over her leg, and in that way he finally went to sleep. </p> <p>These three people slept and dreamed, while outside the house the moon grew large, and seemed to move across the sky until it was out over the ocean and growing smaller and paler. In his dream, someone is offering Myers a glass of Scotch, but just as he is about to take it, reluctantly, he wakes up in a sweat, his heart racing. </p> <p> Sol dreams that he is changing a tire on a truck and that he has the use of both of his arms. </p> <p> Bonnie dreams she is taking two-no, three-children to the park. She even has names for the children. She named them just before the trip to the park. Millicent, Dionne, and Randy. Randy keeps wanting to pull away from her and go his own way. </p> <p> Soon, the sun breaks over the horizon and birds begin calling to each other. The Little Quilcene River rushes down through the valley, shoots under the highway bridge, rushes another hundred yards over sand and sharp rocks, and pours into the ocean. An eagle flies down from the valley and over the bridge and begins to pass up and down the beach. A dog barks. </p> <p> At this minute, Sol's alarm goes off. </p> <p>Myers stayed in his room that morning until he heard them leave. Then he went out and made instant coffee. He looked in the fridge and saw that one of the shelves had been cleared for him. A little sign was Scotch-taped to it: MR. MYERS SHELF. </p> <p> Later, he walked a mile toward town to a little service station he remembered from the night before that also sold a few groceries. He bought milk, cheese, bread, and tomatoes. That afternoon, before it was time for them to come home, he left the rent money in cash on the table and went back into his own room. Late that night, before going to bed, he opened his notebook and on a clean page he wrote, Nothing. </p> <p> He adjusted his schedule to theirs. Mornings he'd stay in the room until he heard Sol in the kitchen making coffee and getting his breakfast. Then he would hear Sol calling Bonnie to get up and then they'd have breakfast, but they wouldn't talk much. Then Sol would go out to the garage and start the pickup, back out, and drive away. In a little while, Bonnie's ride would pull up in front of the house, a horn would toot, and Bonnie would say, every time, I'm coming. </p> <p> It was then that Myers would go out to the kitchen, put on water for coffee, and eat a bowl of cereal. But he didn't have much of an appetite. The cereal and coffee would keep him for most of the day, until the afternoon, when he'd eat something else, a sandwich, before they arrived home, and then he'd stay out of the kitchen for the rest of the time when they might be in there or in the living room watching TV. He didn't want any conversation. </p> <p> She'd go into the kitchen for a snack the first thing after she got in from work. Then she'd turn on the TV and wait until Sol came in, and then she'd get up and fix something for the two of them to eat. They might talk on the telephone to friends, or else go sit outside in the backyard between the garage and Myers's bedroom window and talk about their day and drink iced tea until it was time to go inside and turn on the TV. Once he heard Bonnie say to someone on the telephone, How'd she expect me to pay any attention to Elvis Presley's weight when my own weight was out of control at the time? </p> <p> They'd said he was welcome anytime to sit in the living room with them and watch TV. He'd thanked them but said, No, television hurt his eyes. </p> <p> They were curious about him. Especially Bonnie, who'd asked him one day when she came home early and surprised him in the kitchen, if he'd been married and if he had any kids. Myers nodded. Bonnie looked at him and waited for him to go on, but he didn't. </p> <p> Sol was curious too. What kind of work do you do? he wanted to know. I'm just curious. This is a small town and I know people. I grade lumber at the mill myself. Only need one good arm to do that. But sometimes there are openings. I could put in a word, maybe. What's your regular line of work? </p> <p> Do you play any instruments? Bonnie asked. Sol has a guitar, she said. </p> <p> I don't know how to play it, Sol said. I wish I did. </p> <p> Myers kept to his room, where he was writing a letter to his wife. It was a long letter and, he felt, an important one. Perhaps the most important letter he'd ever written in his life. In the letter he was attempting to tell his wife that he was sorry for everything that had happened and that he hoped someday she would forgive him. I would get down on my knees and ask forgiveness if that would help. </p> <p> After Sol and Bonnie both left, he sat in the living room with his feet on the coffee table and drank instant coffee while he read the newspaper from the evening before. Once in a while his hands trembled and the newspaper began rattling in the empty house. Now and then the telephone rang, but he never made a move to answer it. It wasn't for him, because nobody knew he was here. </p> <p> Through his window at the rear of the house he could see up the valley to a series of steep mountain peaks whose tops were covered with snow, even though it was August. Lower down on the mountains, timber covered the slopes and the sides of the valley. The river coursed down the valley, frothing and boiling over rocks and under granite embankments until it burst out of its confines at the mouth of the valley, slowed a little, as if it had spent itself, then picked up strength again and plunged into the ocean. When Sol and Bonnie were gone, Myers often sat in the sun in a lawn chair out back and looked up the valley toward the peaks. Once he saw an eagle soaring down the valley, and on another occasion he saw a deer picking its way along the riverbank. </p> <p> He was sitting out there like that one afternoon when a big flatbed truck pulled up in the drive with a load of wood. </p> <p> You must be Sol's roomer, the man said, talking out the truck window. </p> <p> Myers nodded. </p> <p> Sol said to just dump this wood in the backyard and he'd take care of it from there. </p> <p> I'll move out of your way, Myers said. He took the chair and moved to the back step, where he stood and watched the driver back the truck up onto the lawn, then push something inside the cab until the truck bed began to elevate. In a minute, the six-foot logs began to slide off the truck bed and pile up on the ground. The bed rose even higher, and all of the chunks rolled off with a loud bang onto the lawn. </p> <p> The driver touched the lever again and the truck bed went back to its normal place. Then he revved his engine, honked, and drove away. </p> <p>What are you going to do with that wood out there? Myers asked Sol that night. Sol was standing at the stove frying smelt when Myers surprised him by coming into the kitchen. Bonnie was in the shower. Myers could hear the water running. </p> <p> Why, I'm going to saw it up and stack it, if I can find the time between now and September. I'd like to do it before the rain starts. </p> <p> Maybe I could dc it for you, Myers said. </p> <p> You ever cut wood before? Sol said. He'd taken the frying pan off the stove and was wiping the fingers of his left hand with a paper towel. I couldn't pay you anything for doing it. It's something I was going to do anyway. Just as soon as I get a weekend to my name. </p> <p> I'll do it, Myers said. I can use the exercise. </p> <p> You know how to use a power saw? And an ax and a maul? </p> <p> You can show me, Myers said. I learn fast. It was important to him that he cut the wood. </p> <p> Sol put the pan of smelt back on the burner. Then he said, Okay, I'll show you after supper. You had anything to eat yet? Why don't you have a bite to eat with us? </p> <p> I ate something already, Myers said. </p> <p> Sol nodded. Let me get this grub on the table for Bonnie and me, then, and after we eat I'll show you. </p> <p> I'll be out back, Myers said. </p> <p> Sol didn't say anything more. He nodded to himself, as if he was thinking about something else. Myers took one of the folding chairs and sat down on it and looked at the pile of wood and then up the valley at the mountains where the sun was shining off the snow. It was nearly evening. The peaks thrust up into some clouds, and mist seemed to be falling from them. He could hear the river crashing through the undergrowth down in the valley. </p> <p> I heard talking, Myers heard Bonnie say to Sol in the kitchen. </p> <p> It's the roomer, Sol said. He asked me if he could cut up that load of wood out back. </p> <p> How much does he want to do it? Bonnie wanted to know. Did you tell him we can't pay much? </p> <p> I told him we can't pay anything. He wants to do it for nothing. That's what he said, anyway. </p> <p> Nothing? She didn't say anything for a time. Then Myers heard her say, I guess he doesn't have anything else to do. </p> <p> Later, Sol came outside and said, I guess we can get started now, if you're still game. </p> <p> Myers got up out of the lawn chair and followed Sol over to the garage. Sol brought out two sawhorses and set them up on the lawn. Then he brought out a power saw. The sun had dropped behind the town. In another thirty minutes it would be dark. Myers rolled down the sleeves of his shirt and buttoned the cuffs. Sol worked without saying anything. He grunted as he lifted one of the six-foot logs and positioned it on the sawhorses. Then he began to use the saw, working steadily for a while. Sawdust flew. Finally he stopped sawing and stepped back. </p> <p> You get the idea, he said. </p> <p> Myers took the saw, nosed the blade into the cut Sol had started, then began sawing. He found a rhythm and stayed with it. He kept pressing, leaning into the saw. In a few minutes, he sawed through and the two halves of the log dropped onto the ground. </p> <p> That's the idea, Sol said. You'll do, he said. He picked up the two blocks of wood and carried them over and put them alongside the garage. </p> <p> Every so often-not every piece of wood, but maybe every fifth or sixth piece-you'll want to split it with the ax down the middle. Don't worry about making kindling. I'll take care of that later. Just split about every fifth or sixth chunk you have. I'll show you. And he propped the chunk up and, with a blow of the ax, split the wood into two pieces. You try it now, he said. </p> <p> Myers stood the block on its end, just as Sol had done, and he brought the ax down and split the wood. </p> <p> That's good, Sol said. He put the chunks of wood by the garage. Stack them up about so high, and then come out this way with your stack. I'll lay some plastic sheeting over it once it's all finished. But you don't have to do this, you know. </p> <p> It's all right, Myers said. I want to, or I wouldn't have asked. </p> <p> Sol shrugged. Then he turned and went back to the house. Bonnie was standing in the doorway, watching, and Sol stopped and reached his arm around Bonnie, and they both looked at Myers. </p> <p> Myers picked up the saw and looked at them. He felt good suddenly, and he grinned. Sol and Bonnie were taken by surprise at first. Sol grinned back, and then Bonnie. Then they went back inside. </p> <p> Myers put another piece of wood on the sawhorses and worked awhile, sawing, until the sweat on his forehead began to feel chill and the sun had gone down. The porch light came on. Myers kept on working until he'd finished the piece he was on. He carried the two pieces over to the garage and then he went in, used his bathroom to wash up, then sat at the table in his room and wrote in his notebook. I have sawdust in my shirtsleeves tonight, he wrote. It's a sweet smell. </p> <p> That night he lay awake for a long time. Once he got out of bed and looked out the window at the mound of wood which lay in the backyard, and then his eyes were drawn up the valley to the mountains. The moon was partially obscured by clouds, but he could see the peaks and the white snow, and when he raised his window the sweet, cool air poured in, and farther off he could hear the river coursing down the valley. </p> <p> The next morning it was all he could do to wait until they'd left the house before he went out back to begin work. He found a pair of gloves on the back step that Sol must have left for him. He sawed and split wood until the sun stood directly over his head and then he went inside and ate a sandwich and drank some milk. Then he went back outside and began again. His shoulders hurt and his fingers were sore and, in spite of the gloves, he'd picked up a few splinters and could feel blisters rising, but he kept on. He decided that he would cut this wood and split it and stack it before sunset, and that it was a matter of life and death that he do so. I must finish this job, he thought, or else ... He stopped to wipe his sleeve over his face. </p> <p> By the time Sol and Bonnie came in from work that night-first Bonnie, as usual, and then Sol-Myers was nearly through. A thick pile of sawdust lay between the sawhorses, and, except for two or three blocks still in the yard, all of the wood lay stacked in tiers against the garage. Sol and Bonnie stood in the doorway without saying anything. Myers looked up from his work for a minute and nodded, and Sol nodded back. Bonnie just stood there looking, breathing through her mouth. Myers kept on. </p> <p> Sol and Bonnie went back inside and began on their supper. Afterward, Sol turned on the porch light, as he'd done the evening before. Just as the sun went down and the moon appeared over the mountains, Myers split the last chunk and gathered up the two pieces and carried the wood over to the garage. He put away the sawhorses, the saw, the ax, a wedge, and the maul. Then he went inside. </p> <p> Sol and Bonnie sat at the table, but they hadn't begun on their food. </p> <p> You better sit down and eat with us, Sol said. </p> <p> Sit down, Bonnie said. </p> <p> Not hungry just yet, Myers said. </p> <p> Sol didn't say anything. He nodded. Bonnie waited a minute and then reached for a platter. </p> <p> You got it all, I'll bet, Sol said. </p> <p> Myers said, I'll clean up that sawdust tomorrow. </p> <p> Sol moved his knife back and forth over his plate as if to say, Forget it. </p> <p> I'll be leaving in a day or two, Myers said. </p> <p> Somehow I figured you would be, Sol said. I don't know why I felt that, but I didn't think somehow when you moved in you'd be here all that long. </p> <p> No refunds on the rent, Bonnie said. </p> <p> Hey, Bonnie, Sol said. </p> <p> It's okay, Myers said. </p> <p> No it isn't, Sol said. </p> <p> It's all right, Myers said. He opened the door to the bathroom, stepped inside, and shut the door. As he ran water into the sink he could hear them talking out there, but he couldn't hear what they were saying. </p> <p> He showered, washed his hair, and put on clean clothes. He looked at the things of his in the room that had come out of his suitcase just a few days ago, a week ago, and figured it would take him about ten minutes to pack up and be gone. He could hear the TV start up on the other side of the house. He went to the window and raised it and looked again at the mountains, with the moon lying over them-no clouds now, just the moon, and the snowcapped mountains. He looked at the pile of sawdust out in back and at the wood stacked against the shadowy recesses of the garage. He listened to the river for a while. Then he went over to the table and sat down and opened the notebook and began to write. </p> <p> The country I'm in is very exotic. It reminds me of someplace I've read about but never traveled to before now. Outside my window I can hear a river and in the valley behind the house there is a forest and precipices and mountain peaks covered with snow. Today I saw a wild eagle, and a deer, and I cut and chopped two cords of wood. </p> <p> Then he put the pen down and held his head in his hands for a moment. Pretty soon he got up and undressed and turned off the light. He left the window open when he got into bed. It was okay like that. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Chapter one: Kindling It was the middle of August and Myers was between lives. The only thing different about this time from the other times was that this time he was sober. He'd just spent twenty-eight days at a drying-out facility. But during this period his wife took it into her head to go down the road with another drunk, a friend of theirs. The man had recently come into some money and had been talking about buying into a bar and restaurant in the eastern part of the state. Myers called his wife, but she hung up on him. She wouldn't even talk to him, let alone have him anywhere near the house. She had a lawyer and a restraining order. So he took a few things, boarded a bus, and went to live near the ocean in a room in a house owned by a man named Sol who had run an ad in the paper. Sol was wearing jeans and a red T-shirt when he opened the door. It was about ten o'clock at night and Myers had just gotten out of a cab. Under the porch light Myers could see that Sol's right arm was shorter than his other arm, and the hand and fingers were withered, He didn't offer either his good left hand or his withered hand for Myers to shake, and this was fine with Myers. Myers felt plenty rattled as it was. You just called, right? Sol said. You're here to see the room. Come on in. Myers gripped his suitcase and stepped inside. This is my wife. This is Bonnie, Sol said. Bonnie was watching TV but moved her eyes to see who it was coming inside. She pushed the button on a device she held in her hand and the volume went off. She pushed it again and the picture disappeared. Then she got up off the sofa onto her feet. She was a fat girl. She was fat all over and she huffed when she breathed. I'm sorry it's so late, Myers said. Nice to meet you. It's all right, Bonnie said. Did my husband tell you on the phone what we're asking? Myers nodded. He was still holding the suitcase. Well, this is the living room; Sol said, as you can see for yourself. He shook his head and brought the fingers of his good hand up to his chin. I may as well tell you that we're new at this. We never rented a room to anybody before. But it's just back there not being used, and we thought what the hell. A person can always use a little extra. I don't blame you a bit, Myers said. Where are you from? Bonnie said. You're not from anywhere around town. My wife wants to be a writer, Sol said. Who, what, where, why, and how much? I just got here, Myers said. He moved the suitcase to his other hand. I got off the bus about an hour ago, read your ad in the paper, and called up. What sort of work do you do? Bonnie wanted to know. I've done everything, Myers said. He set the suitcase down and opened and closed his fingers. Then he picked up the suitcase again. Bonnie didn't pursue it. Sol didn't either, though Myers could see he was curious. Myers took in a photograph of Elvis Presley on top of the TV. Elvis's signature ran across the breast of his white sequined jacket. He moved a step closer. The King, Bonnie said. Myers nodded but didn't say anything. Alongside the picture of Elvis was a wedding picture of Sol and Bonnie. In the picture Sol was dressed up in a suit and tie. Sol's good strong left arm reached around Bonnie's waist as far as it would go. Sol's right hand and Bonnie's right hand were joined over Sol's belt buckle. Bonnie wasn't going anywhere if Sol had anything to say about it. Bonnie didn't mind. In the picture Bonnie wore a hat and was all smiles. I love her, Sol said, as if Myers had said something to the contrary. How about that room you were going to show me? Myers said. I knew there was something we were forgetting, Sol said. They moved out of the living room into the kitchen, Sol first, then Myers, carrying his suitcase, and then Bonnie. They passed through the kitchen and turned left just before the back door. There were some open cupboards along the wall, and a washer and dryer. Sol opened a door at the end of the little corridor and turned on the light in the bathroom. Bonnie moved up and huffed and said, This is your private bathroom. That door in the kitchen is your own entrance. Sol opened the door to the other side of the bathroom and turned on another light. This is the room, he said. I made up the bed with clean sheets, Bonnie said. But if you take the room you'll have to be responsible from here on out. Like my wife says, this is not a hotel, Sol said. But you're welcome, if you want to stay. There was a double bed against one wall, along with a nightstand and lamp, a chest of drawers, and a pinochle table with a metal chair. A big window gave out onto the backyard. Myers put his suitcase on the bed and moved to the window. He raised the shade and looked out. A moon rode high in the sky. In the distance he could see a forested valley and mountain peaks. Was it his imagination, or did he hear a stream or a river? I hear water, Myers said. That's the Little Quilcene River you hear, Sol said. That river has the fastest per-foot drop to it of any river in the country. Well, what do you think? Bonnie said. She went over and turned down the covers on the bed, and this simple gesture almost caused Myers to weep. I'll take it, Myers said. I'm glad, Sol said. My wife's glad too, I can tell. I'll have them pull that ad out of the paper tomorrow. You want to move in right now, don't you? That's what I hoped, Myers said. We'll let you get settled, Bonnie said. I gave you two pillows, and there's an extra quilt in that closet. Myers could only nod. Well, good night, Sol said. Good night, Bonnie said. Good night, Myers said. And thank you. Sol and Bonnie, went through his bathroom and into the kitchen. They closed the door, but not before Myers heard Bonnie say, He seems okay. Pretty quiet, Sol said. I think I'll fix buttered popcorn. I'll eat some with you, Sol said. Pretty soon Myers heard the TV come on again in the living room, but it was a very faint sound and he didn't think it would bother him. He opened the window all the way and heard the sound of the river as it raced through the valley on its way to the ocean. He took his things out of the suitcase and put them away in the drawers. Then he used the bathroom and brushed his teeth. He moved the table so that it sat directly in front of the window. Then he looked at where she'd turned the covers down. He drew out the metal chair and sat down and took a ballpoint out of his pocket. He thought for a minute, then opened the notebook, and at the top of a blank white page he wrote the words Emptiness is the beginning of all things. He stared at this, and then he laughed. Jesus, what rubbish! He shook his head. He closed the notebook, undressed, and turned off the light. He stood for a moment looking out the window and listening to the river. Then he moved to get into bed. * * * Bonnie fixed the popcorn, salted it and poured butter over it, and took it in a big bowl to where Sol was watching TV. She let him help himself to some first. He used his left hand to good effect and then he reached his little hand over for the paper towel she offered. She took a little popcorn for herself. What do you make of him? she wanted to know. Our new roomer. Sol shook his head and went on watching TV and eating popcorn. Then, as if he'd been thinking about her question, he said, I like him all right. He's okay. But I think he's on the run from something. What? I don't know that. I'm just guessing. He isn't dangerous and he isn't going to make any trouble. His eyes, Bonnie said. What about his eyes? They're sad eyes. Saddest eyes I ever saw on a man. Sol didn't say anything for a minute. He finished his popcorn. He wiped his fingers and dabbed his chin with the paper towel. He's okay. He's just had some trouble along the way, that's all. No disgrace attached to that. Give me a sip of that, will you? He reached over for the glass of orange drink she was holding and took some. You know, I forgot to collect the rent from him tonight. I'll have to get it in the morning, if he's up. And I should have asked him how long he intends to stay. Damn, what's wrong with me? I don't want to turn this place into a hotel. You couldn't think of everything. Besides, we're new at this. We never rented a room out before. Bonnie decided she was going to write about the man in the notebook she was filling up. She closed her eyes and thought about what she was going to write. This tall, stooped-but handsome!-curly headed stranger with sad eyes walked into our house one fateful night in August. She leaned into Sol's left arm and tried to write some more. Sol squeezed her shoulder, which brought her back to the present. She opened her eyes and closed them, but she couldn't think of anything else to write about him at the moment. Time will tell, she thought. She was glad he was here. This show's for the birds, Sol said. Let's go to bed. We have to get up in the morning. In bed, Sol loved her up and she took him and held him and loved him back, but all the time she was doing it she was thinking about the big, curly headed man in the back room. What if he suddenly opened the bedroom door and looked in on them? Sol, she said, is this bedroom door locked? What? Be still, Sol said. Then he finished and rolled off, but he kept his little arm on her breast. She lay on her back and thought for a minute, then she patted his fingers, let air out through her mouth, and went off to sleep thinking about blasting caps, which is what had gone off in Sol's hand when he was a teenager, severing nerves and causing his arm and fingers to wither. Bonnie began to snore. Sol took her arm and shook it until she turned over on her side, away from him. In a minute, he got up and put on his underwear. He went into the living room. He didn't turn on the light. He didn't need a light. The moon was out, and he didn't want a light. He went from the living room into the kitchen. He made sure the back door was locked, and then he stood for a while outside the bathroom door listening, but he couldn't hear anything out of the ordinary. The faucet dripped-it needed a washer, but then, it had always dripped. He went back through the house and closed and locked their bedroom door. He checked the clock and made sure the stem was pulled. He got into bed and moved right up against Bonnie. He put his leg over her leg, and in that way he finally went to sleep. These three people slept and dreamed, while outside the house the moon grew large, and seemed to move across the sky until it was out over the ocean and growing smaller and paler. In his dream, someone is offering Myers a glass of Scotch, but just as he is about to take it, reluctantly, he wakes up in a sweat, his heart racing. Sol dreams that he is changing a tire on a truck and that he has the use of both of his arms. Bonnie dreams she is taking two-no, three-children to the park. She even has names for the children. She named them just before the trip to the park. Millicent, Dionne, and Randy. Randy keeps wanting to pull away from her and go his own way. Soon, the sun breaks over the horizon and birds begin calling to each other. The Little Quilcene River rushes down through the valley, shoots under the highway bridge, rushes another hundred yards over sand and sharp rocks, and pours into the ocean. An eagle flies down from the valley and over the bridge and begins to pass up and down the beach. A dog barks. At this minute, Sol's alarm goes off. Myers stayed in his room that morning until he heard them leave. Then he went out and made instant coffee. He looked in the fridge and saw that one of the shelves had been cleared for him. A little sign was Scotch-taped to it: MR. MYERS SHELF. Later, he walked a mile toward town to a little service station he remembered from the night before that also sold a few groceries. He bought milk, cheese, bread, and tomatoes. That afternoon, before it was time for them to come home, he left the rent money in cash on the table and went back into his own room. Late that night, before going to bed, he opened his notebook and on a clean page he wrote, Nothing. He adjusted his schedule to theirs. Mornings he'd stay in the room until he heard Sol in the kitchen making coffee and getting his breakfast. Then he would hear Sol calling Bonnie to get up and then they'd have breakfast, but they wouldn't talk much. Then Sol would go out to the garage and start the pickup, back out, and drive away. In a little while, Bonnie's ride would pull up in front of the house, a horn would toot, and Bonnie would say, every time, I'm coming. It was then that Myers would go out to the kitchen, put on water for coffee, and eat a bowl of cereal. But he didn't have much of an appetite. The cereal and coffee would keep him for most of the day, until the afternoon, when he'd eat something else, a sandwich, before they arrived home, and then he'd stay out of the kitchen for the rest of the time when they might be in there or in the living room watching TV. He didn't want any conversation. She'd go into the kitchen for a snack the first thing after she got in from work. Then she'd turn on the TV and wait until Sol came in, and then she'd get up and fix something for the two of them to eat. They might talk on the telephone to friends, or else go sit outside in the backyard between the garage and Myers's bedroom window and talk about their day and drink iced tea until it was time to go inside and turn on the TV. Once he heard Bonnie say to someone on the telephone, How'd she expect me to pay any attention to Elvis Presley's weight when my own weight was out of control at the time? They'd said he was welcome anytime to sit in the living room with them and watch TV. He'd thanked them but said, No, television hurt his eyes. They were curious about him. Especially Bonnie, who'd asked him one day when she came home early and surprised him in the kitchen, if he'd been married and if he had any kids. Myers nodded. Bonnie looked at him and waited for him to go on, but he didn't. Sol was curious too. What kind of work do you do? he wanted to know. I'm just curious. This is a small town and I know people. I grade lumber at the mill myself. Only need one good arm to do that. But sometimes there are openings. I could put in a word, maybe. What's your regular line of work? Do you play any instruments? Bonnie asked. Sol has a guitar, she said. I don't know how to play it, Sol said. I wish I did. Myers kept to his room, where he was writing a letter to his wife. It was a long letter and, he felt, an important one. Perhaps the most important letter he'd ever written in his life. In the letter he was attempting to tell his wife that he was sorry for everything that had happened and that he hoped someday she would forgive him. I would get down on my knees and ask forgiveness if that would help. After Sol and Bonnie both left, he sat in the living room with his feet on the coffee table and drank instant coffee while he read the newspaper from the evening before. Once in a while his hands trembled and the newspaper began rattling in the empty house. Now and then the telephone rang, but he never made a move to answer it. It wasn't for him, because nobody knew he was here. Through his window at the rear of the house he could see up the valley to a series of steep mountain peaks whose tops were covered with snow, even though it was August. Lower down on the mountains, timber covered the slopes and the sides of the valley. The river coursed down the valley, frothing and boiling over rocks and under granite embankments until it burst out of its confines at the mouth of the valley, slowed a little, as if it had spent itself, then picked up strength again and plunged into the ocean. When Sol and Bonnie were gone, Myers often sat in the sun in a lawn chair out back and looked up the valley toward the peaks. Once he saw an eagle soaring down the valley, and on another occasion he saw a deer picking its way along the riverbank. He was sitting out there like that one afternoon when a big flatbed truck pulled up in the drive with a load of wood. You must be Sol's roomer, the man said, talking out the truck window. Myers nodded. Sol said to just dump this wood in the backyard and he'd take care of it from there. I'll move out of your way, Myers said. He took the chair and moved to the back step, where he stood and watched the driver back the truck up onto the lawn, then push something inside the cab until the truck bed began to elevate. In a minute, the six-foot logs began to slide off the truck bed and pile up on the ground. The bed rose even higher, and all of the chunks rolled off with a loud bang onto the lawn. The driver touched the lever again and the truck bed went back to its normal place. Then he revved his engine, honked, and drove away. What are you going to do with that wood out there? Myers asked Sol that night. Sol was standing at the stove frying smelt when Myers surprised him by coming into the kitchen. Bonnie was in the shower. Myers could hear the water running. Why, I'm going to saw it up and stack it, if I can find the time between now and September. I'd like to do it before the rain starts. Maybe I could dc it for you, Myers said. You ever cut wood before? Sol said. He'd taken the frying pan off the stove and was wiping the fingers of his left hand with a paper towel. I couldn't pay you anything for doing it. It's something I was going to do anyway. Just as soon as I get a weekend to my name. I'll do it, Myers said. I can use the exercise. You know how to use a power saw? And an ax and a maul? You can show me, Myers said. I learn fast. It was important to him that he cut the wood. Sol put the pan of smelt back on the burner. Then he said, Okay, I'll show you after supper. You had anything to eat yet? Why don't you have a bite to eat with us? I ate something already, Myers said. Sol nodded. Let me get this grub on the table for Bonnie and me, then, and after we eat I'll show you. I'll be out back, Myers said. Sol didn't say anything more. He nodded to himself, as if he was thinking about something else. Myers took one of the folding chairs and sat down on it and looked at the pile of wood and then up the valley at the mountains where the sun was shining off the snow. It was nearly evening. The peaks thrust up into some clouds, and mist seemed to be falling from them. He could hear the river crashing through the undergrowth down in the valley. I heard talking, Myers heard Bonnie say to Sol in the kitchen. It's the roomer, Sol said. He asked me if he could cut up that load of wood out back. How much does he want to do it? Bonnie wanted to know. Did you tell him we can't pay much? I told him we can't pay anything. He wants to do it for nothing. That's what he said, anyway. Nothing? She didn't say anything for a time. Then Myers heard her say, I guess he doesn't have anything else to do. Later, Sol came outside and said, I guess we can get started now, if you're still game. Myers got up out of the lawn chair and followed Sol over to the garage. Sol brought out two sawhorses and set them up on the lawn. Then he brought out a power saw. The sun had dropped behind the town. In another thirty minutes it would be dark. Myers rolled down the sleeves of his shirt and buttoned the cuffs. Sol worked without saying anything. He grunted as he lifted one of the six-foot logs and positioned it on the sawhorses. Then he began to use the saw, working steadily for a while. Sawdust flew. Finally he stopped sawing and stepped back. You get the idea, he said. Myers took the saw, nosed the blade into the cut Sol had started, then began sawing. He found a rhythm and stayed with it. He kept pressing, leaning into the saw. In a few minutes, he sawed through and the two halves of the log dropped onto the ground. That's the idea, Sol said. You'll do, he said. He picked up the two blocks of wood and carried them over and put them alongside the garage. Every so often-not every piece of wood, but maybe every fifth or sixth piece-you'll want to split it with the ax down the middle. Don't worry about making kindling. I'll take care of that later. Just split about every fifth or sixth chunk you have. I'll show you. And he propped the chunk up and, with a blow of the ax, split the wood into two pieces. You try it now, he said. Myers stood the block on its end, just as Sol had done, and he brought the ax down and split the wood. That's good, Sol said. He put the chunks of wood by the garage. Stack them up about so high, and then come out this way with your stack. I'll lay some plastic sheeting over it once it's all finished. But you don't have to do this, you know. It's all right, Myers said. I want to, or I wouldn't have asked. Sol shrugged. Then he turned and went back to the house. Bonnie was standing in the doorway, watching, and Sol stopped and reached his arm around Bonnie, and they both looked at Myers. Myers picked up the saw and looked at them. He felt good suddenly, and he grinned. Sol and Bonnie were taken by surprise at first. Sol grinned back, and then Bonnie. Then they went back inside. Myers put another piece of wood on the sawhorses and worked awhile, sawing, until the sweat on his forehead began to feel chill and the sun had gone down. The porch light came on. Myers kept on working until he'd finished the piece he was on. He carried the two pieces over to the garage and then he went in, used his bathroom to wash up, then sat at the table in his room and wrote in his notebook. I have sawdust in my shirtsleeves tonight, he wrote. It's a sweet smell. That night he lay awake for a long time. Once he got out of bed and looked out the window at the mound of wood which lay in the backyard, and then his eyes were drawn up the valley to the mountains. The moon was partially obscured by clouds, but he could see the peaks and the white snow, and when he raised his window the sweet, cool air poured in, and farther off he could hear the river coursing down the valley. The next morning it was all he could do to wait until they'd left the house before he went out back to begin work. He found a pair of gloves on the back step that Sol must have left for him. He sawed and split wood until the sun stood directly over his head and then he went inside and ate a sandwich and drank some milk. Then he went back outside and began again. His shoulders hurt and his fingers were sore and, in spite of the gloves, he'd picked up a few splinters and could feel blisters rising, but he kept on. He decided that he would cut this wood and split it and stack it before sunset, and that it was a matter of life and death that he do so. I must finish this job, he thought, or else ... He stopped to wipe his sleeve over his face. By the time Sol and Bonnie came in from work that night-first Bonnie, as usual, and then Sol-Myers was nearly through. A thick pile of sawdust lay between the sawhorses, and, except for two or three blocks still in the yard, all of the wood lay stacked in tiers against the garage. Sol and Bonnie stood in the doorway without saying anything. Myers looked up from his work for a minute and nodded, and Sol nodded back. Bonnie just stood there looking, breathing through her mouth. Myers kept on. Sol and Bonnie went back inside and began on their supper. Afterward, Sol turned on the porch light, as he'd done the evening before. Just as the sun went down and the moon appeared over the mountains, Myers split the last chunk and gathered up the two pieces and carried the wood over to the garage. He put away the sawhorses, the saw, the ax, a wedge, and the maul. Then he went inside. Sol and Bonnie sat at the table, but they hadn't begun on their food. You better sit down and eat with us, Sol said. Sit down, Bonnie said. Not hungry just yet, Myers said. Sol didn't say anything. He nodded. Bonnie waited a minute and then reached for a platter. You got it all, I'll bet, Sol said. Myers said, I'll clean up that sawdust tomorrow. Sol moved his knife back and forth over his plate as if to say, Forget it. I'll be leaving in a day or two, Myers said. Somehow I figured you would be, Sol said. I don't know why I felt that, but I didn't think somehow when you moved in you'd be here all that long. No refunds on the rent, Bonnie said. Hey, Bonnie, Sol said. It's okay, Myers said. No it isn't, Sol said. It's all right, Myers said. He opened the door to the bathroom, stepped inside, and shut the door. As he ran water into the sink he could hear them talking out there, but he couldn't hear what they were saying. He showered, washed his hair, and put on clean clothes. He looked at the things of his in the room that had come out of his suitcase just a few days ago, a week ago, and figured it would take him about ten minutes to pack up and be gone. He could hear the TV start up on the other side of the house. He went to the window and raised it and looked again at the mountains, with the moon lying over them-no clouds now, just the moon, and the snowcapped mountains. He looked at the pile of sawdust out in back and at the wood stacked against the shadowy recesses of the garage. He listened to the river for a while. Then he went over to the table and sat down and opened the notebook and began to write. The country I'm in is very exotic. It reminds me of someplace I've read about but never traveled to before now. Outside my window I can hear a river and in the valley behind the house there is a forest and precipices and mountain peaks covered with snow. Today I saw a wild eagle, and a deer, and I cut and chopped two cords of wood. Then he put the pen down and held his head in his hands for a moment. Pretty soon he got up and undressed and turned off the light. He left the window open when he got into bed. It was okay like that.",

But they convinced him, answering his \"pretty tough questions\", and the Chinese authorities made clear they wanted to have a small charity dedicated to the project, staffed by individuals they could work with. Langlois created the charity Care for Children to help development of a foster care scheme by the Shanghai civil affairs bureau, which is responsible for abandoned children and orphanages. </p> <p>Glover, Laming and Langlois were all agreed that their project must be Chinese and not British. \"These were their children, their city, their culture: they've got to own it and manage it so we deliberately called Robert adviser to the project - he's not the chief executive,\" says Laming. </p> <p>The Shanghai fostering project was launched in September 1998, with the objectives of establishing a foster care programme for children in the Shanghai state orphanage and setting up a programme of childcare training. </p> <p>A month earlier, Glover, his wife Elizabeth and their children moved out to Shanghai and quickly attained local celebrity status: there were not, Glover says, that many families of eight, all with blonde hair. When they went picnicking on the Bund, Shanghai's waterfront, about 250 people gathered to watch them. </p> <p>\"We have frustrations, but we have a tremendous amount of fun,\" says Glover, 44, who is now learning the local tongue. \"We all have our off days and we all have our bad China days, but there's so much going on - it's as though our feet haven't touched the ground for two years.\" </p> <p>The Glovers live in a small and poor village called Jinqiao on the outskirts of Shanghai and spend most of their free time there. \"One particular boy broke my heart,\" says Glover. \"I see lots of disabled children in institutions and in the village we found this little boy who's in a wheelchair and has cerebral palsy. If families are prepared to care for their disabled children that's the most positive thing that could happen really.\" </p> <p>Glover reckons 60% of the children in institutions have disabilities: the Chinese put the figure at about 80%. This includes children who have physical deformities (like cleft lips) which could be corrected quite easily, and children who have been labelled disabled because of a lack of stimulation and nurture in institutions. \"That's been the most rewarding side in that as they have gone into families, they have developed immensely, incredibly so. Even down to some children who hadn't walked, but learned to walk once they were with a family,\" says Glover. </p> <p>The foster care project aims to move the 40% of children without disabilities into families and is building a resource centre offering residential and day care for the more severely disabled children. </p> <p>Eighty-four per cent of the children in institutions are girls - reflecting both the high value put on boys and the fact that it is the son's wife who will care for his parents in old age.

Around 100 warders held an hour-long meeting outside the prison this morning. The POA later said it was a \"strike\", even though officers are banned from taking industrial action under a law brought in by the last Conservative government.</p> <p>Prison Service director general Martin Narey said officers who took part in the protest would have their pay stopped. He went on to warn that, if he does not receive an assurance from the POA that the action will not be repeated, he will seek \"injunctive relief\" in the High Court.</p> <p>Relations between the officer's union and the government have worsened since the test privatisation was announced last month. The POA withdrew goodwill, prompting prisons minister Paul Boateng to abandon an expected announcement aimed at improving industrial relations in the service.</p> <p>POA national chairman Mark Healy said: \"The damaging effects of market testing and privatisation are well documented. Private-sector assault rates for prison officers are twice the figure for the public sector. Prisoners have an even greater probability of being assaulted in private establishments.\"</p> <p>Mr Healy said six prison officers were being assaulted every day and the government's plan could only add to the figure. \"Boateng's policies show scant regard for the health and safety of prisoners and prison officers,\" he added.</p> <p>\"This union will no longer tolerate Boateng's bully-boy tactics which are designed to intimidate thousands of honest, loyal and hardworking public servants in what is rapidly becoming the forgotten public service.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Prison Service threatened legal action against warders today, after officers staged an illegal strike in protest at the government's test privatisation of Brixton prison in south London. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) said there was \"solid support\" for its walkout, adding that privatising jails would lead to an increase in assaults on staff. Around 100 warders held an hour-long meeting outside the prison this morning. The POA later said it was a \"strike\", even though officers are banned from taking industrial action under a law brought in by the last Conservative government. Prison Service director general Martin Narey said officers who took part in the protest would have their pay stopped. He went on to warn that, if he does not receive an assurance from the POA that the action will not be repeated, he will seek \"injunctive relief\" in the High Court. Relations between the officer's union and the government have worsened since the test privatisation was announced last month. The POA withdrew goodwill, prompting prisons minister Paul Boateng to abandon an expected announcement aimed at improving industrial relations in the service. POA national chairman Mark Healy said: \"The damaging effects of market testing and privatisation are well documented. Private-sector assault rates for prison officers are twice the figure for the public sector. Prisoners have an even greater probability of being assaulted in private establishments.\" Mr Healy said six prison officers were being assaulted every day and the government's plan could only add to the figure. \"Boateng's policies show scant regard for the health and safety of prisoners and prison officers,\" he added. \"This union will no longer tolerate Boateng's bully-boy tactics which are designed to intimidate thousands of honest, loyal and hardworking public servants in what is rapidly becoming the forgotten public service.\"",

      "body": "<p>Here is a dilemma few executives have to face: your company has just been bought for a few billion dollars by AT&amp;T and the American telecoms firm offers you several million to stay. Then Bill Gates calls up and asks you to be the chief operating officer for Microsoft. Oh, and some venture capitalists want you to play chief executive for a couple of college kids with a bright idea they are backing to the tune of $2m (\u00a31.3m). </p> <p>That Jim Barksdale chose the last option and became chief of Netscape is now the stuff of internet folklore. But it also says a lot about the palpable atmosphere of the e-revolution that gripped corporate America between 1994 and 1998. </p> <p>Those four years will be seen as the golden era of the net entrepreneur, when anyone with a sprinkling of foresight, dynamism, funding and a decent business idea could become rich more rapidly than virtually any other time in history. </p> <p>It was a time when the bricks and mortar world had not woken up to the opportunities and threats of the medium. The technology companies that had spent the 1970s and 1980s kitting out the US with computer hardware and software were slow off the mark in recognising the impact of the e-revolution. The result was the emergence of an unlikely band of heroes: 33-year-old marketing consultant Jeff Bezos of Amazon; computer sales manager Bob Davis, 35, of Lycos; E-Bay's Pierre Omidyar, a 25-year-old software designer; college students Jerry Yang at Yahoo! and Excite's Joe Kraus. I spent the last three months of 1999 interviewing them to see what made them tick and how they broke the rules. </p> <p>Their varying degrees of success owed much to being first to market. By the time the rest of the US and Europe had woken up at the end of the decade, many of the new firms were established. With sophisticated venture capital backing from Silicon Valley, their moves to the public markets saw them swept up in dot.com euphoria, allowing them to go on a shopping spree for rival upstarts using their highly valued share paper. </p> <p>As the early web firms were addressing the business to consumer market, size was of the essence. The low prices they promised consumers meant that the scale of their business had to be enormous, with the marketing, advertising and staff budgets to match. </p> <p>As spending rocketed the river of red ink threatened to turn into a deluge. The losses among the 12 entrepreneurs amounted to more than $4bn in 1999. Accumulated, their losses run nearer $20bn. What struck me during my conversations was how much guts it takes to run a business where profits are a dim and distant prospect, where your business model is unproven and your monthly burn rate - that is, the amount of expenditure of income - threatens to run out of control. </p> <p>Take Jay Walker of Priceline. His idea for consumers to name their own prices for airline tickets was rejected by the industry. Undeterred, Walker launched his service anyway, subsidising each passenger by an average of $30. His perseverance eventually brought the airlines into partnership, but the self-belief he demonstrated over several difficult months of huge losses was astounding. </p> <p>There are some significant reasons why the likes of Walker are unlikely to be seen again. The internet is no longer virgin territory. Its pervasiveness in the west is reflected in the strategies of all big businesses and most others beside. Every organisation now has an e-strategy, indeed, a number have reinvented themselves around the medium. The result is that the opportunity for individual entrepreneurs to make their mark on companies such as Amazon and Yahoo! have been reduced to around zero. </p> <p>The technology sector has been caught out once and is determined not to be so again. Companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Compaq, Intel and Cisco are pouring billions into internet start-ups. This so-called greenhouse strategy ensures they stay close to events on the ground - and always with an option to buy out their targets. The chances of a Bezos or Yang emerging unscathed through the network of venture capital firms established by the hi-tech sector is difficult to imagine. </p> <p>Finally, internet businesses are moving into an era where their lengthening track record means they can be analysed alongside conventional companies. This has led to a correction in valuations and has made venture capital - which was so easy to come by in the mid-1990s - more difficult to obtain. </p> <p>If Jim Barksdale were making his choice in 2000, one wonders which he would opt for - AT&amp;T, Microsoft or Netscape? My guess would be he would take the first flight to Helsinki and listen to the venture capitalists there. The internet revolution has moved east, and Scandinavia is the new frontier. </p> <p>\u0095 Christopher Price's book, The Internet Entrepeneurs, \u00a313, is published by Pearson Education</p>",

      "bodyText": "Here is a dilemma few executives have to face: your company has just been bought for a few billion dollars by AT&amp;T and the American telecoms firm offers you several million to stay. Then Bill Gates calls up and asks you to be the chief operating officer for Microsoft. Oh, and some venture capitalists want you to play chief executive for a couple of college kids with a bright idea they are backing to the tune of $2m (\u00a31.3m). That Jim Barksdale chose the last option and became chief of Netscape is now the stuff of internet folklore. But it also says a lot about the palpable atmosphere of the e-revolution that gripped corporate America between 1994 and 1998. Those four years will be seen as the golden era of the net entrepreneur, when anyone with a sprinkling of foresight, dynamism, funding and a decent business idea could become rich more rapidly than virtually any other time in history. It was a time when the bricks and mortar world had not woken up to the opportunities and threats of the medium. The technology companies that had spent the 1970s and 1980s kitting out the US with computer hardware and software were slow off the mark in recognising the impact of the e-revolution. The result was the emergence of an unlikely band of heroes: 33-year-old marketing consultant Jeff Bezos of Amazon; computer sales manager Bob Davis, 35, of Lycos; E-Bay's Pierre Omidyar, a 25-year-old software designer; college students Jerry Yang at Yahoo! and Excite's Joe Kraus. I spent the last three months of 1999 interviewing them to see what made them tick and how they broke the rules. Their varying degrees of success owed much to being first to market. By the time the rest of the US and Europe had woken up at the end of the decade, many of the new firms were established. With sophisticated venture capital backing from Silicon Valley, their moves to the public markets saw them swept up in dot.com euphoria, allowing them to go on a shopping spree for rival upstarts using their highly valued share paper. As the early web firms were addressing the business to consumer market, size was of the essence. The low prices they promised consumers meant that the scale of their business had to be enormous, with the marketing, advertising and staff budgets to match. As spending rocketed the river of red ink threatened to turn into a deluge. The losses among the 12 entrepreneurs amounted to more than $4bn in 1999. Accumulated, their losses run nearer $20bn. What struck me during my conversations was how much guts it takes to run a business where profits are a dim and distant prospect, where your business model is unproven and your monthly burn rate - that is, the amount of expenditure of income - threatens to run out of control. Take Jay Walker of Priceline. His idea for consumers to name their own prices for airline tickets was rejected by the industry. Undeterred, Walker launched his service anyway, subsidising each passenger by an average of $30. His perseverance eventually brought the airlines into partnership, but the self-belief he demonstrated over several difficult months of huge losses was astounding. There are some significant reasons why the likes of Walker are unlikely to be seen again. The internet is no longer virgin territory. Its pervasiveness in the west is reflected in the strategies of all big businesses and most others beside. Every organisation now has an e-strategy, indeed, a number have reinvented themselves around the medium. The result is that the opportunity for individual entrepreneurs to make their mark on companies such as Amazon and Yahoo! have been reduced to around zero. The technology sector has been caught out once and is determined not to be so again. Companies such as Microsoft, Oracle, Compaq, Intel and Cisco are pouring billions into internet start-ups. This so-called greenhouse strategy ensures they stay close to events on the ground - and always with an option to buy out their targets. The chances of a Bezos or Yang emerging unscathed through the network of venture capital firms established by the hi-tech sector is difficult to imagine. Finally, internet businesses are moving into an era where their lengthening track record means they can be analysed alongside conventional companies. This has led to a correction in valuations and has made venture capital - which was so easy to come by in the mid-1990s - more difficult to obtain. If Jim Barksdale were making his choice in 2000, one wonders which he would opt for - AT&amp;T, Microsoft or Netscape? My guess would be he would take the first flight to Helsinki and listen to the venture capitalists there. The internet revolution has moved east, and Scandinavia is the new frontier. \u0095 Christopher Price's book, The Internet Entrepeneurs, \u00a313, is published by Pearson Education",

      "body": "<p>Mr Chairman, delegates, and fellow citizens: I am honoured by your nomination, and I accept it. I thank you for giving such a warm welcome to Lynne and me and our family. And, my friends in the Wyoming delegation, I especially want to thank you for your support.</p> <p>The first campaign stop that Lynne and I were privileged to make with Governor and Laura Bush was in Casper, Wyoming - our home town, where Lynne and I graduated from high school 41 years ago. The love and support and enthusiasm of the people of our home state, have buoyed our spirits and strengthened our resolve. We are going to win this election. We will prevail.</p> <p>I have to tell you that I never expected to be in this position. Eight years ago, when I completed my years as secretary of defence, I loaded a U Haul truck and drove home to Wyoming. I didn't plan on a return to public office. Lynne and I settled into a new private life. There was time for fishing and grandchildren, and we were content. But now I am glad to be back in the arena, and let me tell you why.</p> <p>I have been given an opportunity to serve beside a man who has the courage and the vision and the goodness to be a great president: Governor George W Bush.</p> <p>I have been in the company of leaders. I was there on August 9 1974, when Gerald Ford assumed the presidency during our gravest constitutional crisis since the civil war. I saw how character and decency can dignify a great office and unite a great nation.</p> <p>I was a congressman when another man of integrity lived in the White House. I saw a president restore America's confidence, and prepare the foundation for victory in the cold war. I saw how one man's will can set the nation on a new course. I learned the meaning of leadership from President Ronald Reagan. I left congress to join the cabinet of President Reagan's successor.</p> <p>And I'm proud to say that I'm not the only man on this ticket who has learned from the example of President George Bush. I saw resolve in times of crisis...the steady hand that shaped an alliance and threw back a tyrant. He earned the respect and confidence of the men and women of America's armed forces.</p> <p>I have been in the company of leaders. I know what it takes. And I see in our nominee the qualities of mind and spirit our nation needs, and our history demands. Big changes are coming to Washington. To serve with this man, in this cause, is a chance I would not miss.</p> <p>This country has given me so much opportunity. When Lynne and I were growing up, we had so many blessings. We went to good public schools, where we had fine, dedicated teachers. Our mothers, like our fathers, worked outside the home so that we could go to college. We lived in a caring community, where parents were confident that their children's lives could be even better than their own. And that is as it should be, and as it can be again.</p> <p>We can make our public schools better. We can reform the tax code, so that families can keep more of what they earn ...more dollars that they can spend on what they value, rather than on what the government thinks is important.</p> <p>We can restore the ideals of honesty and honor that must be a part of our national life, if our children are to thrive. When I look at the administration now in Washington, I am dismayed by opportunities squandered. Saddened by what might have been, but never was.</p> <p>These have been years of prosperity in our land, but little purpose in the White House. Bill Clinton vowed not long ago to hold onto power \"until the last hour of the last day\". That is his right. But, my friends, that last hour is coming. That last day is near. The wheel has turned ... and it is time...it is time for them to go.</p> <p>George W Bush will repair what has been damaged. He is a man without pretence and without cynicism. A man of principle, a man of honour. On the first hour of the first day...he will restore decency and integrity to the oval office.</p> <p>He will show us that national leaders can be true to their word...and that they can get things done by reaching across the partisan aisle, and working with political opponents in good faith and common purpose.</p> <p>I know he'll do these things, because for the last five years I've watched him do them in Texas. George W Bush came to the Governor's office with a clear view of what he wanted to achieve. He said he would bring higher standards to public schools, and he has. Walk into those schools today, and you will see children with better scores - classrooms with better discipline...and teachers with better pay.</p> <p>He pledged to reduce taxes, and he has. He did it twice, with the biggest tax reduction in state history. And not only is the budget in balance, it's running a surplus of more than $1bn. He promised to reform the legal system...to get rid of junk lawsuits - and he has. Today the legal system serves all the people, not just the trial lawyers.</p> <p>None of these reforms came easily. When he took office, both houses of the legislature were controlled by Democrats, and the house of representatives still is. But Governor Bush doesn't accept old lines of argument and division.</p> <p>He brings people together...reaching across party lines to do the people's business. He leads by conviction, not calculation. You will never see him pointing the finger of blame for failure...you will only see him sharing the credit for success. That is exactly the spirit that is missing from Washington. In the last eight years, that city has often become a scene of bitterness and ill will and partisan strife.</p> <p>American politics has always been a tough business - even in 1787 here in Philadelphia, when George Washington himself wondered if delegates could ever agree on a constitution. They did agree, as Americans always have when it mattered most - guided by the public interest and a decent regard for one another.</p> <p>But in Washington today, politics has become war by other means - an endless onslaught of accusation...a constant setting of groups one against the other. This is what Bill Bradley was up against, and others before him.</p> <p>The Gore campaign, Senator Bradley said, is \"a thousand promises, a thousand attacks\". We are all a little weary of the Clinton-Gore routine. But the wheel has turned. And it is time...it is time for them to go.</p> <p>In this election, they will speak endlessly of risk - we will speak of progress. They will make accusations - we will make proposals. They will feed fear - we will appeal to hope. They will offer more lectures, and legalisms, and carefully-worded denials.</p> <p>We offer another way - a better way - and a stiff dose of truth. For eight years, the achievement gap in our schools has grown worse - poor and disadvantaged children falling further and further behind. For all of their sentimental talk about children, Clinton and Gore have done nothing to help children oppressed by bureaucracy, monopoly, and mediocrity.</p> <p>But those days are ending. When George W Bush is president and I am vice-president, tests will be taken, results will be measured, and schools will answer to parents - and no child will be left behind.</p> <p>For eight years, Clinton and Gore have talked about social security reform - never acting, never once offering a serious plan to save the system. In the time left to them, I have every confidence they'll go right on talking about it.</p> <p>Those days are passing too. There will be no more spreading of fear and panic - no more dividing of generations against one another...no more delaying and excuse making and shirking of our duties to the elderly. George W Bush and I, with the united congress, will save social security.</p> <p>For eight years, Clinton and Gore have extended our military commitments while depleting our military power. Rarely has so much been demanded of our armed forces, and so little given to them in return. George W Bush and I are going to change that, too.</p> <p>I have seen our military at its finest...with the best equipment, the best training, and the best leadership. I'm proud of them. I have had the responsibility for their wellbeing. And I can promise them now - help is on the way. Soon, our men and women in uniform will once again have a commander-in-chief they can respect - one who understands their mission and restores their morale.</p> <p>And now, as the man from Hope goes home to New York, Mr Gore tries to separate himself from his leader's shadow. But somehow we will never see one without thinking of the other. Does anyone - Republican or Democrat - seriously believe that under Mr Gore, the next four years would be any different from the last eight?</p> <p>If the goal is to unite our country, to make a fresh start in Washington, to change the tone of our politics: can anyone say with conviction that the man for the job is Al Gore? They came in together. Now let us see them off together. Ladies and gentlemen, the wheel has turned, and it is time - it is time for them to go.</p> <p>This campaign will not be easy. Governor Bush and I face a real fight. We're ready for it. We know the territory, we know the opposition, and we know what's at stake. We will give all we have to this cause. And in the end, with your help, George W Bush will defeat this vice president, and I will replace him.</p> <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we are so privileged to be citizens of this great republic. I was reminded of that time and again when I was in my former job, as secretary of defence. I travelled a lot...and when I came home, my plane would land at Andrews air force base, and I'd return to the Pentagon by helicopter.</p> <p>When you make that trip from Andrews to the Pentagon, and you look down on the city of Washington, one of the first things you see is the capitol, where all the great debates that have shaped 200 years of American history have taken place. You fly down along the Mall and see the monument to George Washington, a structure as grand as the man himself. To the north is the White House, where John Adams once prayed \"that none but honest and wise men [may] ever rule under this roof\".</p> <p>Next you see the memorial to Thomas Jefferson, the third president and the author of our declaration of independence. And then you fly over the memorial to Abraham Lincoln...this greatest of presidents, the man who saved the union.</p> <p>Then you cross the Potomac, on approach to the Pentagon. But just before you settle down on the landing pad, you look upon Arlington national cemetery - its gentle slopes and crosses row on row. I never once made that trip without being reminded how enormously fortunate we all are to be Americans, and what a terrible price thousands have paid so that all of us - and millions more around the world - might live in freedom.</p> <p>This is a great country, ladies and gentlemen, and it deserves great leadership. Let us go forth from this hall in confidence and courage, committed to restoring decency and honour to our republic. Let us go forth, knowing that our cause is just, and elect George W Bush the 43rd president of the United States.</p>",

The Home Alone actor has auditioned for a leading role in the play Madame Melville which is to begin its run in October, says the Daily Express today. Culkin, now 19, is in need of a serious hit to put his career back on track and believes this is the place to do it. Madame Melville, written by Richard Nelson, tells of a 16-year-old-boy who enjoys the amorous attentions of a 30-something French teacher. It is thought the play will be staged at either the Apollo or Albery theatres in the West End. A production insider revealed that when Culkin's name was first mooted, \"Richard was very reluctant because he's not exactly perceived as a serious actor and has hardly worked at all in the last five or six years but he auditioned last week and amazed everybody with his performance.\" It is thought that 34-year-old French actress Irene Jacob, star of Three Colours Red and the Double Life of Veronique, has been approached to play the part of the French teacher.",

      "body": "<p>He was 19, hiding out from the Nazis in a tailor's attic in Venice when he decided to make a bolt for it and take a night train from Mestre to the mountains in the north. \"There was a threat of air raids,\" he remembered, \"so trains travelled without lights. This train was packed with people crammed together and you couldn't see a thing. At one point I felt a female presence, a woman talking, perhaps, with friends. Despite the crush, being an inveterate smoker, I found a way of lighting a cigarette. And, as I lit it, it lit up my face. I was blinded by the light and didn't see who was opposite me. The woman came closer to me, brushed against me and we kissed... At the first stop, still in the darkness, the whole group got off. And I never knew who I kissed. In any case, the kiss was beautiful.\" </p> <p>But not that surprising. Because the face that had been lit up belonged to Marcello Mastroianni, who would become one of the most romantic stars of post-war cinema. Nowadays, if you want to sum up Italian style, that sinuous Italian charm that is so easy on the ear and eye, then it's usually Mastroianni who comes to mind. In Italy they called him \"Il Bel Marcello\" and when he died nearly five years ago, the Trevi Fountain in Rome that he had made so famous in La Dolce Vita was switched off and draped in black crepe. </p> <p>This month, however, Marcello is restored to us on celluloid with the screening of 22 of his films at the National Film Theatre. Yet not even this many movies can convey his full contribution to European cinema, since Mastroianni probably made more great films than any other actor. His breakthrough in the 1957 film White Nights also brought its director, Luchino Visconti, to world attention, and Mastroianni did the same for Antonioni in La Notte, as well as countless others such as Ettore Scola, Mario Monicelli, Marco Ferreri and the Taviani brothers. And that's just the Italian directors; he also worked with Roman Polanski, Louis Malle, Jaques Demy, Paul Ruiz and John Boorman. </p> <p>However, the director with whom Mastroianni will always be associated is Federico Fellini, who regarded Marcello as a younger brother and cinematic alter ego. \"He's gentle, open and intelligent,\" said Fellini. \"He enters his character on tiptoes and never asks a question.\" </p> <p>But the bond was not secured when they started work on their first film together, La Dolce Vita. Fellini had wanted to cast Paul Newman or almost any other big American star, while Mastroianni had a problem with being cast opposite the voluptuous Swedish ex-beauty queen Anita Ekberg, because she reminded him of \"a Nazi soldier who arrested me during the war\". Yet, against the odds, his role as a disconsolate observer of Roman consumption, egged on by Ekberg's pulchritude in the Trevi Fountain, was a triumph, to the extent that the film's title became virtually synonymous with post-war affluence. </p> <p>And yet, though La Dolce Vita was responsible for reviving the fortunes of Italian cinema, the ever-ambitious Fellini persisted in trying to cast another big star - Charlton Heston or Laurence Olivier - as the lead in his next movie, 8 1/2. Mastroianni, meanwhile, set up camp in the foyer of Fellini's hotel, where he would nod and smile over his paper as the maestro passed by each day. Which is how he got the part, because, as the British director John Boorman points out, \"Marcello did not insist, he did not protest, he did not plead. He was simply present.\" </p> <p>Boorman, who directed Mastroianni in his 1970 film Leo the Last, adds: \"I never felt the need to apologise to Marcello for making him wait during filming. He was the most relaxed person I've ever worked with. In fact, on Leo the Last, we were doing a scene where he was in bed and while we were altering the lights and lining up the camera, he fell asleep - just drifted off until we woke him up so that he could act being asleep again.\" </p> <p>As Boorman remembers with obvious affection, \"Marcello was such a consummate actor. He made your life so easy because he could find unlimited ways of expressing what you needed, and he did it with such ease. He'd arrive in the moring, put on his clothes and he would put on the character with the costume. Then he'd stay in character all day through lunchtime, when you could have put the camera on him. And then, when you called a wrap at the end of the day, he'd change back into himself and never give it another thought.\" </p> <p>This is the key to Mastroianni's style, his apparently effortless acting. Though he was nearly always cast as the romantic lead, he approached every role as a character actor. As he explained, \"With Fellini, there is usually nothing much to read but I read the script once, twice, three times, then I put it aside and never look at it again. I think about my character and start to creep up on him. The director can change the script but I'll still react in character - which is my job.\" </p> <p>As with all his films, this searching out of a role came from an innate talent for observation. Boorman remembers how the character of Leo - \"all his body movements and tics\" - was based on \"a prop man that we had. Marcello watched him all of the time and seemed to assume his shape.\" Sometimes, in the search for an object of imitation, his eyes would alight on his director, most famously Fellini on 8 1/2. He copied the cheek-sucking tic of Pietro Germi for that director's wonderful 1961 comedy Divorce Italian Style. </p> <p>But for all Mastroianni's intuitive mimicry, his acting style was backed up by a solid technique learnt early in his career in Rome with a theatrical troupe led by Visconti. Here, over a 10-year apprenticeship, Mastroianni performed almost every classical role, from Astrov in Uncle Vanya to Stanley Kowalski in an acclaimed production of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire in 1952. There then followed another seven years working his way up from small roles in Italian movies, so that by the time he came to international prominence in La Dolce Vita, he was a 35-year-old screen veteran with over 40 films under his belt. </p> <p>\"There's so much behind that easy style,\" says Boorman. \"So much depth, so much subtlety and sensitivity behind it. He was extraordinarily aware of everything. He's always thought of as this Latin lover type, but in fact he was really a very gentle, unassuming man. And then, of course, he had that charm.\" </p> <p>That world-weary charm has now become so much a part of Mastroianni's image that it's almost impossible to disentangle it from the actual actor. But when pressed to define this quality, Boorman says it came from the fact that Mastroianni was prepared to reveal his vulnerability. \"He made everyone feel sorry for him. I think women went to bed with him because they felt so sorry for him. They thought they could cure that melancholy, that overwhelming sadness that he had.\" </p> <p>But then Boorman laughs as he remembers visiting him when he was living in Paris with Catherine Deneuve. \"She had this beautiful modern apartment - glass tables, white furniture and chrome, that sort of thing. She went off to make coffee and as soon as she disappeared, Marcello turned to me and whispered, 'John, you have no idea what my life is like here. She is...' He gestured at the cool decor. 'So cold.' And then when she came back in he smiled sweetly, 'Aah, cara mia, grazie, grazie.' And there I was feeling sorry for Marcello because he had to live with the divine Deneuve.\" </p> <p>But Boorman also believes that this all-embracing charm was touched by a Roman pragmatism that was bred into Mastroianni's bones. \"He told me once about his father, who was a carpenter in Fontana Liri [a small town halfway between Rome and Naples] and how, when the fascists came to power in the 20s, they burst into his workshop in black shirts, shorts, the whole regalia. They banged on his workbench. \"Are you a fascist?\" they cried. \"Are you a fascist?\" His father looked up and said, \"If you like.\" </p> <p>Boorman thinks that this is \"very much Marcello\" and, after remarking that \"everyone adored him,\" he claims that Mastroianni worked his magic by \"taking you into his confidence. When he came over to do Leo, he said to me, 'John, it's a little embarrassing, but you know, in Italy it's necessary we have the contract.' I said, 'I know what you're saying - you need two contracts, the real one and the one to give to the taxman with half the amount.' 'It's a little more complicated than that,' he said. 'I need three - because the taxman knows we do this. So he comes to me and we argue and I cry. I say, 'No, no, this is the true,' and finally, finally, I pull out the other contract - which is still not the right one.' \" </p> <p>At the end of the day, Mastroianni had few interests outside cinema. He loved the companionship of making a movie, although he refused to lose any sleep over a film that did badly. In the end, he believed that everything was useful or, as he put it, \"Tutto fa brodo\" (everything makes soup). He didn't understand the myth of the suffering actor, the tortured soul unable to shed his character when he goes home for dinner. \"Why do Americans find acting so difficult?\" he asked Boorman. Then he supplied the answer, thus explaining why we will always love watching this warm, generous actor. \"For me acting is like making love. While I am doing it I enjoy it, and when it is over, I hope I can do it again tomorrow.\" Grazie, bel Marcello. </p> <p>The Marcello Mastroianni season starts at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), on August 6.</p>",

They thought they could cure that melancholy, that overwhelming sadness that he had.\" But then Boorman laughs as he remembers visiting him when he was living in Paris with Catherine Deneuve. \"She had this beautiful modern apartment - glass tables, white furniture and chrome, that sort of thing. She went off to make coffee and as soon as she disappeared, Marcello turned to me and whispered, 'John, you have no idea what my life is like here. She is...' He gestured at the cool decor. 'So cold.' And then when she came back in he smiled sweetly, 'Aah, cara mia, grazie, grazie.' And there I was feeling sorry for Marcello because he had to live with the divine Deneuve.\" But Boorman also believes that this all-embracing charm was touched by a Roman pragmatism that was bred into Mastroianni's bones. \"He told me once about his father, who was a carpenter in Fontana Liri [a small town halfway between Rome and Naples] and how, when the fascists came to power in the 20s, they burst into his workshop in black shirts, shorts, the whole regalia. They banged on his workbench. \"Are you a fascist?\" they cried. \"Are you a fascist?\" His father looked up and said, \"If you like.\" Boorman thinks that this is \"very much Marcello\" and, after remarking that \"everyone adored him,\" he claims that Mastroianni worked his magic by \"taking you into his confidence. When he came over to do Leo, he said to me, 'John, it's a little embarrassing, but you know, in Italy it's necessary we have the contract.' I said, 'I know what you're saying - you need two contracts, the real one and the one to give to the taxman with half the amount.' 'It's a little more complicated than that,' he said. 'I need three - because the taxman knows we do this. So he comes to me and we argue and I cry. I say, 'No, no, this is the true,' and finally, finally, I pull out the other contract - which is still not the right one.' \" At the end of the day, Mastroianni had few interests outside cinema. He loved the companionship of making a movie, although he refused to lose any sleep over a film that did badly. In the end, he believed that everything was useful or, as he put it, \"Tutto fa brodo\" (everything makes soup). He didn't understand the myth of the suffering actor, the tortured soul unable to shed his character when he goes home for dinner. \"Why do Americans find acting so difficult?\" he asked Boorman. Then he supplied the answer, thus explaining why we will always love watching this warm, generous actor. \"For me acting is like making love. While I am doing it I enjoy it, and when it is over, I hope I can do it again tomorrow.\" Grazie, bel Marcello. The Marcello Mastroianni season starts at the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), on August 6.",

Maybe income from all future increases in the cost of petrol - whether caused by inflation or anything else - should be devoted to research into solar alternatives. Do not dump the pump, seize the sun.",

In a report reflecting growing, as yet unstated, opposition within the cabinet to the US project, the Commons cross-party foreign affairs committee calls on ministers to \"articulate the very strong concerns\" expressed in Britain about the plan. Under the multibillion dollar scheme - which would require new American radar bases in Britain - the US would protect itself with a battery of ground-based rockets designed to intercept incoming missiles. President Bill Clinton has said he is in favour of a limited system designed to protect the US from what Washington used to call \"rogue\" states but now refers to as \"states of concern\" - North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Libya. George W Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, says he wants a much more ambitious project closer to President Ronald Reagan's original \"star wars\" plan, to protect the US from any potential enemy.

Vladimir Putin and Jiang Zemin, the Russian and Chinese presidents, warned last month that an American decision to go ahead with NMD would \"pose the most grave adverse consequences\". The US project is also opposed by most of Britain's European allies, including France and Germany. The Guardian has learned that the French president Jacques Chirac and German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der recently urged Tony Blair to adopt a common European approach urging the US to abandon the project. The prime minister dismissed the idea, though many of his cabinet colleagues, notably the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, as well as Mr Blair's senior military advisers, are known to be strongly opposed to NMD. The US plan relies on the up grading of the early warning station at Fylingdales on the North York moors and as well as the US eavesdropping station at Menwith Hill near Harrogate in North Yorkshire. The US defence department, the Pentagon, also says it needs to build a new 14-storey X-band radar station in Britain - something Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, has pointed out, would be impossible to hide. Other ministers have gone further. One with direct knowledge of the project told the Guardian that a US request to construct a new radar station here would be a \"nightmare\". He said Greenham Common - the US cruise missile base in Berkshire besieged by women peace protesters through the 1980s - would \"look easy by comparison\". Opponents of the US project in Whitehall are now suggesting that John Prescott, the environment secretary, has told Washington it would need planning permission to build a new radar site - not a quick or easy procedure, especially if a national park, a likely location, is selected. Though he has sidestepped questions about how he would respond to a Pentagon request to use bases here for the NMD plan, Mr Hoon has admitted that Britain would be a target of \"rogue\" states if the government acceded to it. In today's report, the foreign affairs committee says it is incumbent on the government \"as one of the five nuclear weapons states and as a close ally of the US\", to make an early public statement on its analysis of NMD's likely impact on strategic stability and its assessment of whether this would be \"in the overall security interests of this country\". That is all the more important, it says, because of \"apparently contradictory views\" from the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.

      "bodyText": "A national register of stalkers could be set up to help the police keep track of serial offenders, particularly the hard core of potentially violent men and women who target their victims indiscriminately, the Home Office revealed yesterday. It also disclosed that almost 6,000 people had been convicted of stalking offences in 1998. The database would prevent stalkers going \"underground\" and would be modelled on the sex offenders register, which gives police limited powers to alert organisations, including schools, when an offender moves into the neighbourhood. If a similar list were introduced, stalkers would be ordered to tell the police if they changed their name or moved address. Victims of stalking welcomed the proposal yesterday, but Liberty, the civil rights group, said the Home Office needed to move cautiously. John Wadham, its director, said stalking behaviour needed to be clearly defined so that only genuine offenders were included on the list. The Home Office said it was determined to crack down on a growing problem. \"Harassment can have a devastating effect on people's lives,\" said the Home Office minister Charles Clarke.\"It is something that must be tackled.\" The department said yesterday that it had asked researchers to \"establish the case\" for a stalking register. Ministers and civil servants will then consult with police and relevant organisations, including Liberty, before deciding whether to press ahead. \"This is something that needs to be considered very carefully and we will not rush into it,\" a Home Office spokesman said. \"We want to test the case for establishing a register. We want to make sure we are not missing out on a really useful tool.\" The Home Office said it would distinguish between the non-violent stalker motivated by a failed relationship and the violent obsessive who targets strangers. \"The register would not apply to all people convicted of stalking offences. We have to be extremely careful not to lump everyone together.\" The Home Office estimates the research and consultation could take up to 12 months. One victim, Tracey Morgan, whose case triggered the introduction of the anti-stalking Protection from Harassment Act three years ago, said a register would give people \"greater peace of mind\". She was stalked for seven years by former Royal Navy petty officer Anthony Burstow. Her ordeal began when she was working as a civilian clerical officer at HMS Collingwood in Fareham, Hampshire, and continued throughout the 1990s, even though Burstow was convicted on numerous occasions and sent to jail. Liberty claimed the Protection from Harassment Act had been used to stifle public protest, and called on the Home Office to specify what information the register would require from offenders. Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat shadow home secretary, added: \"Registers of this type should focus on those who genuinely pose a threat, not registering people for the sake of it.\" The announcement of plans to consider the stalking register coincided with the publication of guidelines to police forces for using their anti-stalking powers effectively. The Home Office study revealed 5,800 people were convicted of stalking offences in England and Wales in 1998. The majority - 4,300 - were convicted of the lesser charge of criminal harassment. The rest were convicted of putting victims in fear of violence, which has a maximum sentence of five years. The study found 80% of victims were women, and 80% of stalkers were men. Nearly all of those convicted of stalking knew their victims. Only 4% were \"stranger\" stalkers. Scotland Yard's Detective Inspector Hamish Brown, who researched and wrote the guidelines for the police, warned cyber-stalking was on the increase and feared victims, who are often bombarded with emails, were not coming forward. \"I'm quite convinced that this is one area that is under-reported.

Last week the European commission announced it would act against unnamed cigarette manufacturers to recover tax losses from smuggling.

But the case filed in Miami is the first time lawyers have started to actively pursue BAT, which yesterday reported six-monthly profits of nearly \u00a3700m from brands such as Dunhill and Rothmans. Operating profits in Latin America rose 42%, but BAT admitted a growing amount of money - \u00a3150m a year - is going on legal work to fend off cases involving smoking-related illnesses. The tobacco group, which has former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke as deputy chairman, said it had not yet been served with papers by the Ecuadorian government.

Scientists have already found hundreds of thousands of variations, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Testing 100,000 SNPs in 1,000 patients would cost $100m. copyright: New York Times",

It was this leak that eventually caught fire. This was the cause of the fire,\" he added.</p> <p>BA yesterday grounded the same Concorde that had to make an emergency landing at Heathrow on Saturday after a loud bang was heard inside the jet, caused by a mixture of fuel and air. Yesterday it was taken out of service for \"minor adjustments\" shortly before it was due to leave Heathrow for New York. The 33 passengers were switched to a back-up Concorde which took off at 12.56pm instead of the scheduled 10.30am. The company insisted that there were no grounds for concern over the plane's safety. A BA spokeswoman said the company was being \"especially vigilant\" about any technical irregularities.</p> <p>BA said senior engineeers were not 100% happy with the aircraft after it had been inspected. The Concorde had just come out of the hangar after maintenance and pre-flight checks. The spokeswoman said: \"It had an engine change and engineers wanted to make a few more checks on it. Rather than delay passengers even more, we took the decision to bring in another aircraft.\"</p> <p>BA maintains a staff of some 200 engineers who regularly service the seven strong Concorde fleet. In the last year 37 official safety reports - called mandatory occurrence reports - have been filed to the Civil Aviation Authority from either pilots or air traffic controllers concerning Concorde. There have been more than 100 other minor incidents logged by BA which were not thought to be of sufficient importance to be passed on to the CAA. The CAA said: \"Thirty-seven safety reports on seven aircraft over the past 12 months is not unusual and less than we would get for sub-sonic jumbos. It shows how seriously aircraft safety is regarded in Britain.\"</p> <p>The house of a German couple who died in last week's crash has been ransacked by thieves. A police spokesman said intruders broke a police seal on the front door of the couple, Helga and Wolfgang Schnitter, at Potsdam, near Berlin. Many of the German passengers were known to be wealthy, but police said that the Schnitters were not.</p> <p><b> Useful links: </b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.british-airways.com/concorde/index.shtml\" target=\"_new\">British Airways - Concorde</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/8952/e_index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Unofficial Concorde homepage</a> <br><a href=\"http://aviation-safety.net/\" target=\"_new\">Aviation Safety Network</a></p>",

In addition, the plane's undercarriage did not pull up and it had difficulty climbing into the sky, never achieving a sufficiently fast speed, said Paul Louis Arslanian, head of the French accident and inquiry office. \"We also found evidence of fuel leakage. It was this leak that eventually caught fire. This was the cause of the fire,\" he added. BA yesterday grounded the same Concorde that had to make an emergency landing at Heathrow on Saturday after a loud bang was heard inside the jet, caused by a mixture of fuel and air. Yesterday it was taken out of service for \"minor adjustments\" shortly before it was due to leave Heathrow for New York. The 33 passengers were switched to a back-up Concorde which took off at 12.56pm instead of the scheduled 10.30am. The company insisted that there were no grounds for concern over the plane's safety. A BA spokeswoman said the company was being \"especially vigilant\" about any technical irregularities. BA said senior engineeers were not 100% happy with the aircraft after it had been inspected. The Concorde had just come out of the hangar after maintenance and pre-flight checks. The spokeswoman said: \"It had an engine change and engineers wanted to make a few more checks on it. Rather than delay passengers even more, we took the decision to bring in another aircraft.\" BA maintains a staff of some 200 engineers who regularly service the seven strong Concorde fleet. In the last year 37 official safety reports - called mandatory occurrence reports - have been filed to the Civil Aviation Authority from either pilots or air traffic controllers concerning Concorde. There have been more than 100 other minor incidents logged by BA which were not thought to be of sufficient importance to be passed on to the CAA. The CAA said: \"Thirty-seven safety reports on seven aircraft over the past 12 months is not unusual and less than we would get for sub-sonic jumbos. It shows how seriously aircraft safety is regarded in Britain.\" The house of a German couple who died in last week's crash has been ransacked by thieves. A police spokesman said intruders broke a police seal on the front door of the couple, Helga and Wolfgang Schnitter, at Potsdam, near Berlin. Many of the German passengers were known to be wealthy, but police said that the Schnitters were not. Useful links: British Airways - Concorde Unofficial Concorde homepage Aviation Safety Network",

Gone is the red-meat rhetoric that sent the party crashing to defeat in 1992: at that year's convention, professional fire-breather Pat Buchanan declared a \"culture war\" in America, in which Republicans would \"take back our country, street by street\". Two years later Newt Gingrich was leading an army of angry white males in a Republican revolution that stormed the Congress. The result was a party with a persona that could be captured in a single adjective: mean-spirited.</p> <p>This time Bush Jnr is determined to shake off that image. He wants to do for the Republicans what Tony Blair and Bill Clinton did for Labour and the Democrats: to ditch their old reputations for extremism and march towards the vote-rich centre. For Blair and Clinton, that meant keeping a safe distance from policies or people associated with the old left. For George W, it means inclusion and diversity. Or, put another way, shoving white males into the background and showing off everyone else.</p> <p>The strategy is so blatant as to be almost comic. The three co-chairs of the convention just happen to be a black Oklahoman, a hispanic Texan and a white single mother. The headline speaker on Monday was the black former general and Gulf war hero, Colin Powell. Last night's prime-time hour kicked off with Condoleeza Rice, Bush's choice for national security adviser: she is black and a woman (and therefore a \"twofer\", quips one Republican strategist). The entertainment tonight will come from Harold Melvin (black) and Jon Secada (Cuban); tomorrow George W will be serenaded by Chaka Khan. Already delegates have swayed to a black gospel choir and been roused by a black, revivalist-style preacher in full throat. One of the few white males to make it has been Congressman Jim Kolbe, who won a decent speaking slot last night. But he had an advantage that outweighed his white-maleness: he is gay.</p> <p>\"Make no mistake about it,\" warns my Republican strategist. \"Bush is personally obsessed with diversity.\" Besides his wife Laura, W has asked only one other Bush family member to speak in Philadelphia. It is not his brother Jeb, governor of Florida, nor even his father, the former president (whose defeat W is so determined to avenge in November). No, the invitation went to his nephew, George P, on the Mexican side of the family: he will deliver half his address tomorrow in English, half in Spanish.</p> <p>What is George W playing at? Surely he does not expect to erode the decades-old Democratic lock on America's minorities and suddenly recruit black and hispanic Americans to the party of Nixon, Reagan and Gingrich? No, he is not as naive as that - though he reckons he has a chance to make inroads into the latino vote. Rather, the object of all this cuddly, compassionate conservative attention can be seen in the placards delegates are waving on the floor of the First Union Center. \"W,\" they say, \"stands for women.\"</p> <p>Republican thinking is that not many black voters are likely to leave the party of Bill Clinton, famously hailed by novelist Toni Morrison as \"our first black president\". Instead, it is white suburban women, the floating voters known as \"soccer moms\", who may be persuaded to see the Republicans in a whole new light. Bush's advisers want to set women thinking, \"If this party is friendlier to minorities, then perhaps it will be friendlier to me.\" (The chase for women's votes also explains the convention's constant emphasis on children: Powell's speech mentioned the word 37 times.)</p> <p>If that's the logic, will it work? It has already paid dividends for the Republicans themselves. They are in more confident form in Philly than they have been for years - some say since Reagan's re-election convention of 1984. They believe they finally have a winner in Bush, and a winning game-plan: ditch the old, harsh rhetoric and sound sweet.</p> <p>The trouble is that the image and reality don't quite match. Take the convention itself. For all the diversity on the platform, little more than 4% of the delegates in the hall are black. You could see that when the Bill Jolly gospel choir was in full flight: what the cameras picked up was an audience full of white folks, clapping out of time. You can see the same problem in the party's programme, formally endorsed on Monday: it still commits Republicans to a total ban on abortion and to adamant opposition to gay rights. You can see it in the reaction to the tougher, truth-telling passages in Powell's speech. When the general told Republicans they had to reach out to ethnic minorities, especially African-Americans, \"not just during an election-year campaign\" but \"every day; it must be for real\", the delegates paused. When he scolded them for opposing affirmative action, which had helped so many black youngsters, they held back their applause.</p> <p>And you can see it most clearly in the biggest decision George W has yet had to make: his choice of running-mate. The former defence secretary, Dick Cheney, has been cast as a grey-haired Mr Gravitas, adding ballast to a featherweight candidate. But the choice of Cheney is more revealing than that: it shows that Bush is still more conservative wolf than compassionate sheep.</p> <p>As a congressman, Cheney had one of the most consistently rightwing voting records of any Republican in the House. He voted against a gun-control measure that would have banned so-called \"cop-killer\" armour-piercing bullets; in 1986 he even voted against a call for the release of Nelson Mandela. In a TV interview this week, Cheney's wife Lynne denied that their daughter was living openly as a lesbian: she reacted as if it were an accusation. None of this will help make George W's Republican party look either kinder or gentler.</p> <p>How all this pans out is not merely an American tale. If Bush becomes president it will sound alarm bells for both Tony Blair and William Hague. For Blair, it will signal an end to the third-way era, in which the PM could present himself as on the crest of an international, centrist wave. Suddenly the \"new\" in New Labour will look jaded: so 90s. For Hague, the worry is of a different order. If George W proves that conservatives win only when they project an image (whatever the reality) of diversity and inclusion, then where does that leave the party of section 28, the party that hounds asylum seekers? This week Hague, Blair and the rest of us should keep an eye on Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com&quot;\"> jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Suddenly the \"new\" in New Labour will look jaded: so 90s. For Hague, the worry is of a different order. If George W proves that conservatives win only when they project an image (whatever the reality) of diversity and inclusion, then where does that leave the party of section 28, the party that hounds asylum seekers? This week Hague, Blair and the rest of us should keep an eye on Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

He will allow television and newspaper photographers to train their lenses on all six family members, including 16-year-old Euan, who was recently found drunk and incapable after a teenage drinking spree, and his baby brother, Leo. The decision by the prime minister and his wife, Cherie, to reverse their earlier stance amounted to a diplomatic success for the PCC's chairman, Lord Wakeham, the wily ex-cabinet minister whose \"Mr Fixit\" talents were honed as the Tory chief whip and the leader of both the Commons and the Lords. In a statement, Lord Wakeham made clear that No 10 had called for his \"guidance\" after the weekend run-in over unauthorised photos of Leo's christening at a Catholic church in Mr Blair's Sedgefield constituency. He promised wider consultation with the media and some new guidance in the PCC's code of practice, but offered a short-term compromise. Noting the Blairs' \"serious reservations about putting their children in the public eye\", Lord Wakeham concluded that \"the most constructive way to strike the balance between legitimate privacy and legitimate public interest in photos of the family is for them to undertake this photocall during the first few days of their holiday\". \"No 10 agrees with me on this - and we hope that after the photocall has taken place the family will be able to complete its holiday in private.\" The decision to cut out the Tuscan photocall predated the christening row and, in part, reflected the Blairs' anxiety that they will be accused of exploiting their children for political ends if they make them too accessible. In reality, as the royal family has found, a balance which offends no one is almost impossible to maintain. No photos of Euan, Nicky, 14, or Kathryn, 12, were used in Sunday's christening photo. Downing Street put a brave face on the tactical retreat and stressed that the photocall will be conducted at the media's request, not theirs. \"It is now well over a year since up to date photos of the older children were released; they have decided that all six of them will take part together in this photocall,\" a statement from Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's press spokesman, added. \"This is a difficult area, in that the prime minister and Mrs Blair wish their children to enjoy as normal an upbringing as possible and to be able to grow up without the constant glare of the media spotlight. \"However, they also accept that given the prime minister's very high public profile there is bound to be an interest in his family, particularly since the arrival of the baby.\" Last night a Conservative spokesman, Andrew Lansley, praised Lord Wakeham for common sense and consistency. \"It is only surprising that anything else should have been considered by Downing Street,\" he said.",

Nearly 40 of their relatives, who now mainly live in Israel and the United States, are expected to attend.</p> <p>With them will be the Struma's only survivor, David Stoliar, who lost his girlfriend, schoolmates and friends from Romania on the ship. Mr Stoliar, 19 at the time, clung to debris in the sea to survive. Turkish men rowed out from a nearby lighthouse to save him 24 hours later. He is convinced the ship was torpedoed.</p> <p>If it is found, the vessel will be left on the seabed as a mass grave. But Mr Buxton hopes material about the tragedy will be used in British schools by the Imperial War Museum, London, and the Holocaust Education Trust. Both are involved in the project to trace the vessel. Mr Buxton's names are an anglicisation of his grandfather's Romanian names. It was his father, Michael Buxton, who received Grigori and Enta's postcards from the Struma.</p> <p>Michael was in England, where he had come in the 1930s to study as an engineer. He saw the news of the sinking while serving as a British soldier. He and his wife, now in their 80s, will fly out to the Istanbul memorial service.</p> <p>Gregory Buxton, an IT systems manager, grew up familiar with his grandparents' story. But what fired him into action was a visit to Israel two years ago.</p> <p>There he traced the plot of land which Grigori and Enta had bought to live on if their flight from persecution succeeded. They had had to flee twice in their lives: Grigori, originally a Russian Jew, had been economic adviser to the short-lived Kerensky government overthrown by Russian communists in 1917. \"It moved me very much when I thought that this was the closest I could get to their graves,\" Mr Buxton said, \"That was when the idea came to me that I ought to pursue this bit of my family history\".</p> <p>He discovered a story of financial exploitation by Romania of its fleeing Jewish minority and \"profound hypocrisy\" by Britain, which controlled wartime immigration to Palestine. From the onset of war, the Romanian port of Constanza seethed with thousands of Jewish people queuing at travel agencies for passages on what sometimes turned out to be \"coffin ships\".</p> <p>In late 1941 Grigori and Enta, then in their 50s, were among those who saw a voyage advertised to Palestine on a luxury liner. Posters and brochures featured a picture of the Queen Mary.</p> <p>In fact, the Nazis had requistitioned almost all waterworthy Romanian ships to carry food and cattle to Germany. The ramshackle Struma, only 155 feet long, without a single lavatory, abandoned in dock, was rated too old to risk cattle.</p> <p>Renamed and re-registered, she horrified her Jewish passengers. But they were told they would be transferred to a cruise liner offshore. Instead, she reached Istanbul with a wonky engine and leaking hull. There passengers were stranded on board in pigsty conditions for 71 days because Britain maintained that its Palestine immigration quota did not cover \"enemy aliens\".</p> <p>On February 23, Turkey ordered the Struma out of port. Next day she blew up. Placards appeared on London streets declaring that Sir Harold MacMichael, Palestine high commissioner, was wanted for \"murder of 800 refugees\".</p> <p>Sir Harold was the only official punished after a parliamentary uproar. He was blamed for delays in telling Turkey about British willingness to admit children aged 11-16 on the ship to Palestine. Sir Harold was transferred to Malaya. After the war several attempts were made to assassinate him. He was wounded twice.</p>",

Nearly 40 of their relatives, who now mainly live in Israel and the United States, are expected to attend. With them will be the Struma's only survivor, David Stoliar, who lost his girlfriend, schoolmates and friends from Romania on the ship. Mr Stoliar, 19 at the time, clung to debris in the sea to survive. Turkish men rowed out from a nearby lighthouse to save him 24 hours later. He is convinced the ship was torpedoed. If it is found, the vessel will be left on the seabed as a mass grave. But Mr Buxton hopes material about the tragedy will be used in British schools by the Imperial War Museum, London, and the Holocaust Education Trust. Both are involved in the project to trace the vessel. Mr Buxton's names are an anglicisation of his grandfather's Romanian names. It was his father, Michael Buxton, who received Grigori and Enta's postcards from the Struma. Michael was in England, where he had come in the 1930s to study as an engineer. He saw the news of the sinking while serving as a British soldier. He and his wife, now in their 80s, will fly out to the Istanbul memorial service. Gregory Buxton, an IT systems manager, grew up familiar with his grandparents' story. But what fired him into action was a visit to Israel two years ago. There he traced the plot of land which Grigori and Enta had bought to live on if their flight from persecution succeeded. They had had to flee twice in their lives: Grigori, originally a Russian Jew, had been economic adviser to the short-lived Kerensky government overthrown by Russian communists in 1917. \"It moved me very much when I thought that this was the closest I could get to their graves,\" Mr Buxton said, \"That was when the idea came to me that I ought to pursue this bit of my family history\". He discovered a story of financial exploitation by Romania of its fleeing Jewish minority and \"profound hypocrisy\" by Britain, which controlled wartime immigration to Palestine. From the onset of war, the Romanian port of Constanza seethed with thousands of Jewish people queuing at travel agencies for passages on what sometimes turned out to be \"coffin ships\". In late 1941 Grigori and Enta, then in their 50s, were among those who saw a voyage advertised to Palestine on a luxury liner. Posters and brochures featured a picture of the Queen Mary. In fact, the Nazis had requistitioned almost all waterworthy Romanian ships to carry food and cattle to Germany. The ramshackle Struma, only 155 feet long, without a single lavatory, abandoned in dock, was rated too old to risk cattle. Renamed and re-registered, she horrified her Jewish passengers. But they were told they would be transferred to a cruise liner offshore. Instead, she reached Istanbul with a wonky engine and leaking hull. There passengers were stranded on board in pigsty conditions for 71 days because Britain maintained that its Palestine immigration quota did not cover \"enemy aliens\". On February 23, Turkey ordered the Struma out of port. Next day she blew up. Placards appeared on London streets declaring that Sir Harold MacMichael, Palestine high commissioner, was wanted for \"murder of 800 refugees\". Sir Harold was the only official punished after a parliamentary uproar. He was blamed for delays in telling Turkey about British willingness to admit children aged 11-16 on the ship to Palestine. Sir Harold was transferred to Malaya. After the war several attempts were made to assassinate him. He was wounded twice.",

      "bodyText": "Solicitors will today launch an action against the McDonald's hamburger chain on behalf of more than 20 customers, most of them children, who claim they were burned by hot tea or coffee served in the company's restaurants. \"Many of the children involved are toddlers,\" said Adrienne de Vos from the Manchester law firm Slater, Heelis, Collier, Littler, which represents 13 of the alleged victims. About 20 more cases are in preparation and more inquiries are expected. \"I know that some would say such drinks are meant to be hot and that people should simply take more care,\" said Ms de Vos. \"This misses the point. Customers don't realise just how hot and dangerous these drinks are and the level of damage that can be caused.\" The solicitors will argue that McDonald's knowingly served hot drinks at dangerously high temperatures in breach of both the Consumer Protection Act (1987) and the Occupiers Liability Act (1957). Ms de Vos said most cases were the result of a spill. \"Some have involved young children who have picked up a drink without knowing how hot it is and then spilled the contents down their chests,\" she said. In other cases, it is alleged that customers have accidentally dropped or spilled drinks on children, causing them to suffer weeks of pain, and in one case, permanent scarring. Ms de Vos claims evidence similar to that of her clients had satisfied an American jury. In 1994 81-year-old Stella Liebeck was awarded $2.7m in punitive damages (later reduced to $480,000) and $160,000 in compensation after she spilled a cup of coffee in a McDonald's restaurant in New Mexico. She spent seven days in hospital after being scalded on her groin, thighs and buttocks. In a statement, McDonald's said yesterday that its first concern was the safety of its customers. \"All our products, including drinks, are carefully prepared to precise specifications. All our hot drinks are served in cups fitted with a lid bearing the words 'Caution - hot'. \"We will be examining the proceedings once issued and made available to us.

      "bodyText": "The government is planning to virtually abolish the remnants of the civil legal aid system for most home owners in England and Wales in a move to finance greater access to free legal advice for people with little or no capital assets. In a move denounced by the Law Society as \"catastrophic\" in its effects - and condemned by some libertarian MPs - the lord chancellor's department has issued a consultation document which would deny full legal aid to anyone with more than \u00a33,000 of equity in their property. Under the proposals they would not have to sell their homes before taking legal action but the government would claim its costs when the owner eventually sold up - charging \"commercial rate\" interest in the meantime. It would \"effectively abolish legal aid for all owner occupiers\", said the Legal Aid Practitioners Group. But the government insists that a slightly higher proportion of households - 49% instead of 48% - will now be eligible for some legal aid because of other proposals. The \"capital eligibility limit\" of \u00a31,000 in bank accounts will be raised to\u00a33,000. Currently anyone with up to \u00a3100,000 tied up in their home can qualify for legal aid. The average first time buyer had \u00a311,780 of equity last year - \u00a325,000 in the case of existing owners moving house. Ministers defend another squeeze on \"middle class perks\" - the trade-off for lower direct tax rates - as a way to fund the extension of the government's community legal service. It gives free, early advice to low income groups - especially on social welfare issues such as benefit disputes and employment law. David Lock, the junior minister in charge of the service, called the change a means of \"providing a fairer system for people who need the help most\" as well as ensuring that \"there is a balance between those receiving publicly funded help and those funding their cases themselves.\" The proposals amount to a deterrent to litigants whose claims are not well founded - they would have to bear all or part of the cost. But lawyers' groups say it would also \"deny an awful lot of people any real chance of access to justice.\" Critics, including Labour MPs and peers who tried to resist the 1999 Access to Justice Act - Lord Irvine's reform of legal aid - complain that the exercise is chiefly about saving money on a very expensive system. Legal aid doubled in just six years to \u00a31.5bn by the time Labour returned to power in 1997, \u00a3700m for civil legal aid. Government supporters argue that many beneficiaries of the system include the better off and legal aid lawyers, a problem which bedevils the criminal courts where sophisticated crooks salt away huge assets and claim legal aid. Robert Marshall-Andrews QC, the Labour MP for Medway, said: \"This proposal is entirely consistent with what has transparently been the government's policy for some time, that is to say an end to civil legal aid and its replacement by the no win, no fee contingency fee system, something very close to the American ambulance chasing system.\" During the passage of the access to justice bill, the MP and his allies failed to ensure that children, pensioners and the disabled would retain legal aid to sue companies and other better funded litigants. Under pressure from lawyers, Lord Irvine made an exception for medical negligence, which is famously costly and is still funded by legal aid for lower income claimants. But most personal injury cases, for example car accident claims, must be funded personally or from no win, no fee or insurance based arrangements. Lord Irvine's concern to get most help to the neediest commands widespread support, but some lawyers say his preoccupation with benefit and employment law reflects the priorities of his own legal practice - Cherie Booth QC is based there.",

      "bodyText": "British consumers penalised by \"rip off\" prices in the motor industry gained a partial victory yesterday when the government announced plans to cut the average cost of a car by \u00a31,100. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, said the change would save car buyers an estimated \u00a31bn a year - about 10% on the price of a car. His announcement was broadly welcomed, but the Consumers' Association - while estimating savings could be as high as 25% on some cars - still described it as \"only a limited step forward\". Until the car industry was no longer exempt from competition law - which bans manufacturers from fixing different prices for dealers in separate countries - British consumers would still be penalised, it warned. The announcement follows the publication in April of a competition commission report which found British consumers were paying around 10% more for a new car compared to their European coun terparts. A subsequent European Union survey, released last month, revealed British buyers were paying up to twice as much for some makes - with 65 of the top 73 models being more expensive in Britain than in any other country in Europe. The April findings prompted price-cutting among manufacturers, with Mitsubishi, Porsche and Land Rover slashing prices by 10%, and Ford, Peugeot and Renault making cashback offers of up to \u00a31,500. But the flurry of activity could not disguise the discrepancies and yesterday Mr Byers, who has spearheaded the campaign against \"rip off Britain\", insisted these should be tackled more permanently. Under a new legal order - which will come into force on September 1, the day of the next number plate change - suppliers must offer the same discounts to individuals as they do to fleet buyers. They will also be prevented from paying bonuses or giving preferences to dealers who pre-register cars (under this system, dealers inflate their \"sales\" figures by registering them in their own names and then sell them to genuine purchasers later); and they will be required to publish information about the number of cars pre-registered - thus discouraging the industry from being able to sell them as \"nearly new\" and so keep other prices artificially high. The minister acknowledged that he had set a \"demanding\" timetable, but added: \"I believe it is more important for the industry to bring prices down quickly and give consumers the confidence to buy.\" The motor industry pointed out that prices had fallen by more than 6% in the past year, and warned buyers not to expect a massive reduction immediately. \"The Consumers' Association have come up with a figure of 25% but we've no idea where that's come from. There's no way we can cut prices by a quarter,\" said Rob Halloway, of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. \"As it is, this is demanding legislation, although it's reasonably fair.\" But private car dealerships - which have not been offered the discounts available to fleet buyers previously - welcomed the measures. \"At last the consumer can visit their car dealer with total confidence, assured that they will get the best deal around when purchasing their new car,\" said David Evans, chief executive of the Retail Motor Industry Federation. \"This order will deliver lower prices quickly, and restore consumer confidence.\"",

I suggested to my colleagues at the European ministers' meeting last Friday in Marseille that they consider the long-term immigration prospects for Europe - prompted by misunderstandings generated by the publication last March of the UN's population growth forecasts to the year 2050.</p> <p>These forecasts, based on an absurd assumption that north-south population growth imbalance and shrinking birth rates in western countries can be rectified by importing foreign populations, generated the incongruous figures in your article.

I suggested to my colleagues at the European ministers' meeting last Friday in Marseille that they consider the long-term immigration prospects for Europe - prompted by misunderstandings generated by the publication last March of the UN's population growth forecasts to the year 2050. These forecasts, based on an absurd assumption that north-south population growth imbalance and shrinking birth rates in western countries can be rectified by importing foreign populations, generated the incongruous figures in your article. It was therefore necessary for the ministers in charge of immigration in EU member states to restore a level-headed vision. The introductory document to our discussions, quoted by your article, noted that there are still three main flows into our countries: the inflow of migrant workers, which has never stopped completely - and which is particularly high in the UK; political asylum seekers; and reuniting of families, which is the first step towards integration.

It happens every year on the anniversary of the invasion, and the government-run telephone counselling service lays on extra staff to cope with calls.</p> <p>\"People have flashbacks,\" says Dr Humoud al-Qashan of the Social Development Organisation, which has dealt with 15,000 cases since it opened in 1992. Television programmes, newspaper articles, even chance events can trigger panic attacks.</p> <p>Two years ago, on August 2, there was a wedding party where someone fired a gun, as happens at some traditional Arab weddings. One of the guests, convinced that the Iraqis were back, went berserk and ended up in hospital.</p> <p>Phobias, depression, marital violence, suicide attempts, crime, drug abuse, delinquency. Dr Qashan has a long list of problems which have become worse since the invasion.</p> <p>It is not just the shock of war in one of the least militaristic Arab countries that has left these scars, but the calculated cruelty of the Iraqi forces.</p> <p>\"Before the war, Kuwaitis weren't used to seeing blood,\" says Dr Badria al-Awadhi, a lawyer. She tells of one man who was executed in front of his home. The Iraqis would not let his relatives take the body inside for six hours, to make sure that the neighbours would see it and take heed.</p> <p>In another case, Adel Ibrahim had borrowed a car from his brother, Rashid. The Iraqis stopped and searched it, and found his brother's military ID card. They phoned his home, offering to release Adel if Rashid came to the police station. Rashid went, and neither son returned. Adel had only one kidney and needed regular medication. His father took the medicine to the police station but they refused to accept it. Weeks later, they asked him to send it. That was the last he heard of either son.</p> <p>During the last three weeks of the war, thousands of Kuwaitis were rounded up randomly in the streets and mosques. The Iraqis knew they were going to be driven out and wanted hostages to trade, Kuwaitis believe. A decade later, 605 are still un accounted for. Iraq says it does not know what happened to them.</p> <p>The experience of 10 years ago has shaken Kuwait's conservative values, and old social taboos have gone, especially among the young. Some refuse to wear the traditional white robe. Others try to look like Americans, their heroes. A popular haircut is \"the marine\". And, Dr Qashan says, \"there is no shame nowadays if you say 'I have a girlfriend'.\"</p> <p>Perhaps this would have happened anyway. Kuwait is a cosmopolitan place, where around 65% of the 2.3m inhabitants are foreigners. But most of them are guest-workers from poorer countries - India, Pakistan, Egypt, the Philippines - and are unlikely role models for young Kuwaitis.</p> <p>The increased openness also has a political side which can be traced directly to the war. In 1986, the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, dissolved parliament and suspended the constitution. \"People feared that that might be the end of democracy,\" says Hassan Jawher, now a Shia member of parliament.</p> <p>The turning point came in 1990, after the invasion, when the exiled emir called a national gathering in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. \"We needed internal unity to face the Iraqi regime. Any fifth column would have been a disaster,\" Mr Jawher says.</p> <p>The result was a commitment to restore democracy, which kept the Kuwaitis united and helped to bolster international support for their cause.</p> <p>Today Kuwait is the only Arab country in the Gulf with an elected parliament - though women, along with police officers and the military, are not allowed to vote. The 50-member assembly is notoriously assertive. Last year parliament threw out an emergency decree made by the emir during a recess which granted women the vote.</p> <p>Kuwait now faces a situation, also noticeable in other Arab countries such as Jordan and Morocco, where reform is driven not from the grass-roots but from the top - in this case by the emir and a highly-educated liberal elite - and resisted by conservative elements in parliament and among Islamists.</p> <p>It is late evening and Ahmad Baqer, an Islamist MP, is holding a diwaniya, a uniquely Kuwaiti institution which has survived from the Bedouin days. The walls of the vast, marble-floored reception room are lined with sofas and small tables. Some 30 men, dressed in identical white robes, sit talking. Most have beards. A male servant plies glasses of tea and thimbles half-filled with bitter coffee.</p> <p>Diwaniyas were once an elite gathering where the most wealthy could show off their largesse and everyone could speak freely. Sometimes the emir would drop in, because in the days before parliament it was a way of tapping public opinion. Today, everyone with social aspirations holds them.</p> <p>Some describe them as Kuwait's \"second parliament\", but they are also a place for business talk, not to mention rumours and disinformation. Diwaniyas have been known to move stock markets.</p> <p>The talk at Mr Baqer's diwaniya is of oil. He describes the investigation into a refinery accident, and how such things might be prevented. An old man produces a map showing oil fields straddling the border with Saudi Arabia. Mr Baqer explains how the revenues are apportioned.</p> <p>Several men are looking to Mr Baqer to solve their problems. A young man is looking for work. There is a brief phone call to one of the princes but, sorry, no job.</p> <p>By now, Mr Baqer is on to one of his favourite themes: why women should not have the vote. There is no point, he says. Women, obviously, would vote the way their husbands told them. God ordained that a woman's duty is to care for her family, not to get involved in politics. If more women would stay at home there would be no need for all these foreign servants. In any case, he adds, women do not understand politics because they do not attend the diwaniyas.</p> <p>There is, in fact, one mixed-sex diwaniya, founded some years ago by the emir's cousin, Princess Rasha al-Sabah. But the nearest thing to an all-woman diwaniya is the Women's Cultural and Social Society. Here, eight women, in western clothes, are gathered round a table. They speak flawless English, and most have postgraduate degrees and professional careers.</p> <p>They ridicule Mr Baqer's views on women's voting rights, and laugh at one of the male arguments against allowing women into parliament: that women's periods would cloud their judgement.</p> <p>As for women staying at home to do the cooking, they all agree that servants are essential: there are no cr\u00e8ches or playgroups. How else could wives go out to work?</p> <p>The important thing, they all say, is to treat servants properly. Everyone has heard stories of servants being ill-treated, but there are others of servants returning early from holidays in the Philippines, or staying with the same family for 20 years.</p> <p>No, they agree, Filipinos do not earn the minimum Kuwaiti wage of 400 dinars (\u00a3870) a month. But they do get free food and lodging.</p> <p><b>Statistics of a conflict</b></p> <p><b> \u0095Casualties of the Gulf war</b><br> The US estimates more than 100,000 Iraqi soldiers died, 300,000 wounded, 150,000 deserted, and 60,000 taken prisoner.

A young man is looking for work. There is a brief phone call to one of the princes but, sorry, no job. By now, Mr Baqer is on to one of his favourite themes: why women should not have the vote. There is no point, he says. Women, obviously, would vote the way their husbands told them. God ordained that a woman's duty is to care for her family, not to get involved in politics. If more women would stay at home there would be no need for all these foreign servants. In any case, he adds, women do not understand politics because they do not attend the diwaniyas. There is, in fact, one mixed-sex diwaniya, founded some years ago by the emir's cousin, Princess Rasha al-Sabah. But the nearest thing to an all-woman diwaniya is the Women's Cultural and Social Society. Here, eight women, in western clothes, are gathered round a table. They speak flawless English, and most have postgraduate degrees and professional careers. They ridicule Mr Baqer's views on women's voting rights, and laugh at one of the male arguments against allowing women into parliament: that women's periods would cloud their judgement. As for women staying at home to do the cooking, they all agree that servants are essential: there are no cr\u00e8ches or playgroups. How else could wives go out to work? The important thing, they all say, is to treat servants properly. Everyone has heard stories of servants being ill-treated, but there are others of servants returning early from holidays in the Philippines, or staying with the same family for 20 years. No, they agree, Filipinos do not earn the minimum Kuwaiti wage of 400 dinars (\u00a3870) a month. But they do get free food and lodging. Statistics of a conflict \u0095Casualties of the Gulf war The US estimates more than 100,000 Iraqi soldiers died, 300,000 wounded, 150,000 deserted, and 60,000 taken prisoner. Human rights groups claimed much higher numbers of Iraqis killed in action. The US suffered 148 killed and 458 wounded. \u0095Impact of sanctions Per capita spending in Iraq on health before 1990 was about $90: 10 years later it is $12. $230m a year was invested in education in 1990. It has fallen to $23m. \u0095Equipment and losses in liberation of Kuwait Tanks: Iraq lost 4,000 out of 4,230; allies lost four out of 3,360. Artillery: Iraq lost 2,140 out of 3,110; allies one out of 3,633. Armoured personnel carriers: Iraq lost 1,856 out of 2,870; allies nine out of 4,050. Helicopters: Iraq lost seven out of 160; allies 17 out of 1,959. Aircraft: Iraq lost 240 out of 800; allies 44 out of 2,600. \u0095Weapons of mass destruction Until 1991 Iraq stockpiled various chemical weapons containing sarin, tabun, soman, VX and possibly hydrogen cyanide, and biological weapons containing anthrax and typhoid. \u0095The military coalition against Iraq in 1991 Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Honduras, Italy, Kuwait, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Korea, Spain, Syria, Turkey, the UAE, Britain and the US. \u0095Sanctions Between 1945 and 1990 the UN imposed sanctions on two countries: Rhodesia and South Africa. Since 1990 it has imposed sanctions on 13 countries.",

These panels should never have been established in the first place.</p> <p>\"Giving further advice, albeit helpful and welcome, on how they should deal with violent pupils and seriously disruptive behaviour undermines their supposedly independent status. We particularly object to target setting to reduce exclusions from schools.\"</p> <p>Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"We expect the guidelines to accept that additional support is needed in schools and that priority must be given to ensure the protection of both pupils and staff.\"</p>",

In a significant u-turn, ministers effectively handed back full powers to head teachers, allowing them permanently to exclude very violent or disruptive pupils without the threat of independent appeal panels overturning their decisions. Heads have complained that they were increasingly unable to maintain discipline in schools because hundreds of troublesome pupils were being allowed back by \"perverse\" decisions by the panels, which are operated by local education authorities. Yesterday heads warned that exclusions were now set to rise, jeopardising the government's target of cutting the annual 12,000 exclusions by 33% by 2002.

But Jackie Smith, the schools minister, insisted the ambitious target would stay. \"The targets stand and we expect to hit them.\" The Department for Education and Employment had bowed to the heads' earlier wishes and published revised guidance for the panels rein forcing the powers of heads to exclude violent pupils. The guidance, which will come into force at the beginning of the new school year in September, says a panel must not order a pupil to be reinstated where a head has excluded a troublemaker in line with an explicit discipline policy. Announcing the details at the annual conference of the Professional Association of Teachers, in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, Ms Smith detailed four key offences on which appeal panels should no longer overrule the decision of head teachers. They are: serious actual or threatened violence against another pupil or member of staff; sexual abuse; drug dealing; or consistent disruptive behaviour, including vandalism, bullying and racial discrimination. \"Our approach to school exclusions is to give head teachers the powers they need to tackle a variety of discipline problems,\" she said. She revealed that in the last year for which the government has full figures there were 960 appeals against expulsions - nearly 25% of them won by parents. Margaret Morrissey, general secretary of the Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations, said: \"I expect we are going to see more expulsions now. We understand and sympathise with the reasons why the government has changed its mind. But I think we are in a real mess now, because the alternative provisions for these pupils is not yet there.\" Kay Driver, general secretary of Pat, said it was \"very odd\" that the government had chosen to give guidance to supposedly independent panels. \"It is also not clear what recourse a headteacher will have if decisions continue to be overturned by these panels,\" she said. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"I think schools will exclude more pupils but the main issue is what appeal panels will do about it.\" Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: \"Although this is a step in the right direction, it still does not go far enough. These panels should never have been established in the first place. \"Giving further advice, albeit helpful and welcome, on how they should deal with violent pupils and seriously disruptive behaviour undermines their supposedly independent status. We particularly object to target setting to reduce exclusions from schools.\" Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"We expect the guidelines to accept that additional support is needed in schools and that priority must be given to ensure the protection of both pupils and staff.\"",

Barbara showed great intelligence in dealing with the searching questions the inspectorate panels posed her, and she sailed through with flying colours.</p> <p>She was born in Liverpool, educated at Blackburn House grammar school in the city, and, after the college of commerce, worked as a secretary with a tea importing company on the Kirkby trading estate. Her first teaching post, after training in Durham, was in Kirkby. She moved to London in 1960, teaching at a primary school in Brixton. She then became deputy head at a primary school off the Caledonian Road in Islington, and, in 1967, acting head at the nearby Hungerford junior school.</p> <p>She did not get the first headship she applied for. The managers started off by saying they needed someone strong, and that they must have a man. I pointed out that this was a view not permitted by Ilea. They looked at me, but they were not stupid. The list of candidates was made up of three men and three women - and the three men were the first to be rejected. Barbara came second. It was not long, however, before she became head of Laycock school, also in Islington.</p> <p>In the 1960s, that borough was a scene of unrelieved social deprivation, with beautiful houses in multiple occupation and a great proportion of newly-arrived immigrants experiencing language difficulties. By the time Barbara became head, gentrification had started, with Canonbury Square (across the road from Laycock) becoming very posh. The schools began to take in a real social mix.</p> <p>Her school became a delight. The playground was great fun, with motor tyres, pipes and a variety of junk converted into thrilling adventure for the children. Walking among happy children is a rare joy.</p> <p>Below the warmth and lovingness of her personality there was steel. She knew what she wanted, and what she did not want. A new teacher named Sue Siefert was appointed to the school. After a couple of weeks, Ilea told Barbara that Siefert had had a bad college report, that she did not respect authority and that Barbara could reject her if she wished. Barbara said, \"Not on your life,\" and Sue went on to become deputy, and then head of two schools.</p> <p>The 1970s saw an infestation of the anarchic left into the teaching force in north London, culminating in the temporary closure of William Tyndale school, very near Laycock. At the end of the inquiry into what had happened, I was asked to place one of the teachers who had been removed from Tyndale - not an easy task. When I approached Barbara, she replied: \"Of course, Laurie, but two of my best teachers will resign the moment she sets foot in the school.\" I knew when I was beaten.</p> <p>Barbara's marriage to Dan, in 1968, was everything a marriage should be. In her youth, she had flirted with evangelical Christianity; Dan had been a Catholic priest. They went on to live lives that epitomised humanist beliefs and practice.

And what was the point of it all? </p> <p>When the mad dream became a reality three years ago, it was only natural that another visionary should run it. Enter Mark Rylance, a man with a reputation for otherworldliness - a \"dark-side-of-the-moon quality\", as Terry Hands once put it. </p> <p>Rylance's only managerial experience was with his own company, Phoebus Cart, which once undertook a sodden tour of The Tempest, performing only on ley lines. As a director, he was best known for a production of Macbeth in which Jane Horrocks's Lady M peed on stage. </p> <p>There were many doubts about his appointment as the Globe's first artistic director. Yet the choice turned out to be inspired. Rylance is as level-headed as anyone running a theatre in Britain, but he has greater faith than most in his instincts and intuition. It is likely that without him the Globe's opening seasons, which have been subject to the closest scrutiny, would have been as wobbly as the nearby Millennium Bridge. </p> <p>His success has come at a cost. In the 80s, after a string of thrilling per formances, beginning with the RSC's Peter Pan and culminating in a pyjama-clad little-boy-lost Hamlet, people began calling Rylance the greatest actor of his generation. For once, they were not succumbing to hyperbole. </p> <p>Whether he was alternating the roles of both the identity-swapping brothers in Sam Shepard's True West, or playing an Ulster Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing, the deceptively fragile-looking Rylance was always electrifying on stage. He still is, as his current performance in Hamlet at the Globe attests. He is head and shoulders above the production that surrounds him. If he can give such a riveting performance in a mediocre production, one can only imagine what he would be capable of given a first-class director and a great supporting cast. </p> <p>But Rylance, 40, has no regrets. His original contract with the Globe expires next year, but he has just announced that he will do the job for another three years. \"I've gained so much more than I've lost here,\" he insists. \"I may not have always given such good performances, but I've always learned. I feel connected to a community of other actors and an audience, and that is something no other theatre could have given me.\" </p> <p>Rylance is aware that productions at the Globe have not always dispelled the notion of the theatre as a Disneyesque tourist trap or a scholar's plaything. He maintains that while actors are keen to explore the possibilities of the space, directors are more wary of a theatre whose intimate but roofless inn-yard auditorium creates an unfamiliar relationship with the audience. Rylance would love to get really good Shakespearean directors such as Declan Donnellan and Deborah Warner to stage productions. If they don't come, it is not for want of being asked. </p> <p>He concedes that both Donnellan and Warner in particular \"have a puritan aesthetic, and the Globe is a busy aesthetic\" but believes that other highly regarded directors may simply be reluctant to surrender control over the audience: at the Globe the closeness of the crowd to the stage means that the audience are never just a passive spectators. Rylance looks rather hurt: \"I do think it's funny that so many of the people who supported the building of the Globe now don't seem to want to work here.\" </p> <p>If anyone could persuade the doubters to give it a go, surely it would be Rylance, a gentle man held in huge affection by actors. His enthusiasm is so infectious that if he hadn't become an actor, he might have done very well as a cult leader. In fact, in 1995 he both directed and starred in a production of Macbeth at Greenwich in which he played the anti-hero as a devotee of a Hare Krishna-like sect. </p> <p>Rylance has kept faith with Wanamaker's vision, but sees what is taking place at the Globe as an experiment whose results won't emerge for a long time. He enjoys the fact that the dinky toytown theatre with its wooden beams \"looks like a heritage site on the outside, while inside it is the most experimental space in British theatre\". We may not agree, but there is no doubt that Rylance has been right to stand firm against critics of the theatre's design, who argue that the lack of a lighting rig and the open roof means that energy is somehow sucked upwards, militating against an exciting theatrical experience. </p> <p>In fact Rylance says that he began to make sense of the Globe only last year when he played Cleopatra. Then he saw how readily the audience - in broad daylight, and just a couple of feet away - accepted him as the Queen of the Nile. I too have experienced the Globe's strange ability to cast a spell - even during a second-rate production. </p> <p>The magic of the space resists analysis, but Rylance believes that the Globe challenges both actors' and audiences' preconceptions of theatre. \"Peter Hall sees the supporting pillars as an enemy. It's true that not everyone can see everything that goes on on the stage. But everything can be heard. Sound and the spoken word are under threat in our culture and theatre has become very visual - but here we have real storytelling. In other theatres people sit in the dark, their bodies are put to sleep and the focus is all on the concentration of their minds. At the Globe we need stories, and we're still learning how best to tell them.\" </p> <p>It is the process of learning that is keeping Rylance at the Globe. \"I don't think I've peaked - there is still so much to do,\" he says. There are plans to build an education centre and the 330-seater Inigo Jones auditorium, which will be lit entirely by candles. Rylance also wants to do more new plays. His total involvement in the theatre is obvious. He is even about to take a tiny part in The Antipodes, the Richard Brome play that opens next week, alongside his starring role in Hamlet. </p> <p>\"It has been a stressful few years, but I'm very happy at the moment. I feel blessed. I have 3,000 people a day coming to the theatre. A lot of them only pay \u00a35 and I have a direct relationship with them. Could you want more?\" </p> <p>A few days after we talk I return to the Globe to see The Tempest. Outside, the place is thick with kids and tourists. It is not a great production, but it is curiously moving. Before it begins, I get into conversation with a couple of Americans. It turns out that they are not regular theatre-goers, have never even seen a play by Shakespeare before. At the interval I bump into them again. The woman's face is shining, transformed. \"I was afraid I wouldn't understand a word. But it's so easy. It's just a story, isn't it?\" </p> <p>This is what the Globe is all about. Rylance is right. It is not what critics or academics think that matters. If audiences can go to the Globe and discover that they are not afraid of Shakespeare, then this theatre has really achieved something. What is the point of a theatre that has room for the Ariels but none for the Calibans? </p> <p>The Globe season continues till September 24. Hamlet and The Tempest are in rep, The Two Noble Kinsmen opens on Friday and The Antipodes opens on August 12. Box office: 020-7401 9919.</p>",

Rock (real name Robert Ritchie), already embroiled in a long-running custody battle with ex-girlfriend Kelley Russell over their seven-year-old son Robert Ritchie Jr, is now in court facing a defamation suit after Russell took issue with the song Black Chick, White Guy from his 1998 Devil Without A Cause LP, which, she alleges, \"contains inflammatory, untrue, and hurtful remarks\". To wit, the song refers to a \"slut\" with three children by three different men getting beaten up by a drug-dealing boyfriend. Although Russell isn't named in the lyrics, she maintains the song is obviously about her, and is now suing Ritchie for invasion of privacy and inflicting emotional distress. For his part, Rock's lawyer, Orin Snyder said: \"For centuries, artists have been telling their life stories in song, poetry and literature. The law honours and protects this right.\" Even, presumably, if it comes dressed up in a shiny Adidas tracksuit and a cowboy hat. </p> <p>Meanwhile, fans of decrepit British folk-rock bands with flautists who stand on one leg will be delighted to hear that <strong> Jethro Tull</strong> have won the right to the internet addresses JethroTull.com and Jethro-Tull.com. One Denny Hammerton of Florida had registered the URLs, but was ordered to give them up by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), which decided he'd registered them in bad faith. The Tull, it should be noted, succeeded where Sting failed, as his attempt to wrestle sting.com away from Michael Urvan of Georgia was denied by WIPO, making him the first ever celebrity to lose a case of this kind. The defeat rested on the fact that Sting hadn't registered his name as a trademark, and that sting is actually \"a common English word\".</p>",

Rock (real name Robert Ritchie), already embroiled in a long-running custody battle with ex-girlfriend Kelley Russell over their seven-year-old son Robert Ritchie Jr, is now in court facing a defamation suit after Russell took issue with the song Black Chick, White Guy from his 1998 Devil Without A Cause LP, which, she alleges, \"contains inflammatory, untrue, and hurtful remarks\". To wit, the song refers to a \"slut\" with three children by three different men getting beaten up by a drug-dealing boyfriend. Although Russell isn't named in the lyrics, she maintains the song is obviously about her, and is now suing Ritchie for invasion of privacy and inflicting emotional distress. For his part, Rock's lawyer, Orin Snyder said: \"For centuries, artists have been telling their life stories in song, poetry and literature. The law honours and protects this right.\" Even, presumably, if it comes dressed up in a shiny Adidas tracksuit and a cowboy hat. Meanwhile, fans of decrepit British folk-rock bands with flautists who stand on one leg will be delighted to hear that Jethro Tull have won the right to the internet addresses JethroTull.com and Jethro-Tull.com. One Denny Hammerton of Florida had registered the URLs, but was ordered to give them up by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), which decided he'd registered them in bad faith. The Tull, it should be noted, succeeded where Sting failed, as his attempt to wrestle sting.com away from Michael Urvan of Georgia was denied by WIPO, making him the first ever celebrity to lose a case of this kind. The defeat rested on the fact that Sting hadn't registered his name as a trademark, and that sting is actually \"a common English word\".",

And you would need to be alert to spot photographs pinned to a table that show male genitalia secured in medieval-looking devices.</p> <p>In fact, you might not even suspect the existence in a side room of more than 40 stalls bedecked with jumble of a most unvillagey kind: whips, canes, floggers, rubber and PVC outfits, spiked collars, hoods, bondage equipment, high-heeled boots, erotic artwork and literature, maid uniforms, military uniforms, corsetry and piercing jewellery. Stall holders include the Peaches Spanking Club; rubber enthusiasts, Mr and Mrs Blowup; the Bondage Fan Club; dungeon builders, Private Room; and there's a bookstall staffed by the former organiser of the All-England Spanking Championships.</p> <p>According to Heather, a 30-year-old American who is one of the founders of the London Fetish Fair: \"The event is not about tying someone to a post and flaying them alive.

Mr Blowup, the name by which he is \"known on the scene\", says that even a few years ago \"you couldn't get the stuff in shops, there were no clubs and very few magazines.

Terry Pritchard, one of Private Room's partners, says that \"people in the fetish scene are very nice.

There are now fetish clubs in city centres, soft-core fetishistic literature in WH Smith, fetish morris dancing in London suburbs, fetishistic TV commercials, booming business for publishers of fetish magazines and manufacturers of fetish clothing. There are prostitutes who now offer domination as a matter of course, thousands of websites, from worldwide mistress directories to Madame Svetlana's Institute of Sexual Pain in Siberia, increasing numbers of women who describe themselves as \"lifestyle dominatrixes\", and books such as SM101, a technical manual for the serious sado-masochist.</p> <p>All this in a decade that saw a landmark court case which highlighted Britain's repressive sex laws. Home secretary Jack Straw's recent proposal to legalise consensual sexual activity between adults comes 10 years after the Spanner trial, so called after the police operation of that name. Officers from Greater Manchester stumbled on videos depicting middle-aged men engaged in extreme sado-masochistic acts, such as branding each other with hot wires and forcing a nail through someone's scrotum to the sound of Gregorian chants in a purpose-built torture chamber.

However, even with that turnout it is still short of the 21,600 a day it needed to reach its 6m visitor target. With only four months before it closes, only 3.7m have visited it. However, Lord Falconer was bullish despite the further blows to its battered image in the report. \"For the committee to say that there is no 'wow' factor at the dome seems, to me, to be wrong. \"I defy people not to be amazingly impressed by the millennium show and the proof of the pudding is in the eating with the dome, as people who go to it definitely enjoy it.\" The shadow culture secretary, Peter Ainsworth, said the report had been too soft and criticised the committee for being \"unable to get to the bottom of crucial issues\". He added: \"We are not much nearer any answers ... this report throws up little that was not already in the public domain.\" \"Ministers have drawn a cloak of secrecy round issues such as funding, design costs and division of the sale proceeds. More than 70 parliamentary questions on the dome have not been answered.\"",

The council dropped an \u00a380 fixed penalty notice after Jeremy Rosenblatt complained that the procedure it had undertaken went against the European convention on human rights, which comes into force in England and Wales in October. Westminster city council operates a system of halving the fine if it is paid within 14 days. But Mr Rosenblatt argued that this was contrary to article six of the convention, which guarantees the right to a fair trial. Mr Rosenblatt, 39, a family law barrister, said: \"If somebody threatens you with doubling the fine then you aren't being given the right to a fair trial. I decided to fight this for the human rights of the common man, as well as looking after mine.\" He was given two fixed penalty notices when his car was clamped in a parking bay near his home in a Westminster square. The second ticket was issued some hours after the first when the car had not been moved, said a council spokeswoman. Mr Rosenblatt paid his \u00a3125 clamping fee and second penalty notice, but said he was not aware of the first until after the 14 day period had passed. After investigating his claim, the council wrote to Mr Rosenblatt yesterday to cancel the \u00a380 ticket. But councillor Louise St John Howe, chairman of the transportation and highways committee, said there was \"no question\" that the parking fine was cancelled because it was illegal under European human rights law. She said: \"Anyone who receives a parking ticket is entitled to contest it.

      "bodyText": "The crown prosecution service apologised unreservedly yesterday for a \"terrible\" legal slip-up which meant it missed the deadline for lodging appeal papers over a quashed murder conviction. Michael Weir, from Hackney, east London, was jailed for life in 1999 for the murder of 79-year-old war veteran Leonard Harris, after being linked to the crime by a DNA sample he had provided in 1997 in relation to other offences. In May the court of appeal overturned his conviction, ruling that the DNA evidence was inadmissible because it was gathered in connection to unrelated offences. The CPS had planned to appeal to the House of Lords - but missed the deadline for lodging the papers by one day. Yesterday Mr Harris's son, Frank, said it was \"unbelievable\" that such a serious crime had not been pursued by the CPS. The shadow Home Office minister, David Lidington, said: \"It is inexcusable. I would have thought there was a pressing case for the attorney general to mount an inquiry into what on earth went wrong and take appropriate action to ensure there is no repetition.\" Weir had appealed against his conviction for murder, burglary and assault, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey in July 1999. He was linked to Mr Harris's murder in north London in January 1998 by a DNA sample taken after he was charged with drug offences in 1997. But the drug charges were discontinued. Police made the connection after running a DNA profile from blood found on a glove left outside Mr Harris's home through their database. Mr Harris died nearly six months after the attack. Both he and his wife Gertrude, also 79, had received severe head injuries. Chris Newell, CPS director of case work, said yesterday that he could understand the feelings of betrayal. \"I should like to apologise first to Mr Harris, his family and to the public generally for this terrible mistake. \"The CPS deeply regrets that we miscalculated by one day the time for lodging the appeal papers in the House of Lords. There is not any leeway in the legislation.\" Mr Newell said it was necessary to find out \"exactly how the miscalculation occurred and to check our systems and ensure there is no repetition.\" He added: \"There are many time limits in which different stages in the criminal justice system have to be completed.\" He said that a \"speedy\" inquiry was under way to find out at what stage in the process the mistake was made. In an unrelated case, the court of appeal ruled in May that a man accused of raping a 66-year-old woman could not be convicted because the DNA samples linking him to the crime had been gathered in connection with other, unrelated offences. A DNA profile obtained by taking swabs from the victim, who was raped in 1997, was put on the national DNA database. When the accused was arrested for an unrelated burglary in January 1998, a DNA sample was obtained. But in August that year the man was acquitted of the burglary. The appeal judges ruled that the Old Bailey judge was right to disallow the evidence. The decisions prompted Mr Lidington to call at the time for a review of laws on DNA evidence after judges ruled that the two men could not be convicted despite \"compelling\" evidence against them. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act decrees that DNA samples taken from suspects must be destroyed if they are acquitted or the case discontinued, and cannot be used in any other investigation.",

Six young ospreys, second only to the golden eagle in wingspan, were fitted with the \u00a32,000 gadgets yesterday on Lax Hill in Rutland where the first colony south of Hadrian's Wall has established nests overlooking Rutland Water reservoir. Wiped out in the 1850s by hunting, the dramatic fish-hunting raptors have colonised the site from Speyside in Scotland, where a conservation programme has seen 130 nests develop after Britain's last wild breeding pair of ospreys were saved in 1954. Chicks brought from Scotland have stayed loyal to the Midlands site after release over the past two years. The solar-powered trackers will fit in the final piece of a complex jigsaw, which sees the young birds vanish for between two and four years in West Africa before returning unerringly to the site where they were fledged. Tests suggest that the monitors, which weigh less than 2% of the bird's body weight, will be ignored by the ospreys while reliably sending back daily position, speed of flight and route data. \"We think the only thing which can go wrong would be an osprey deciding to settle down and spend the rest of its life under a bush,\" said Helen Dixon, head of the project. \"The data will all go straight on to our website, so anyone interested can track the birds and, like us, find out what they do after arriving in Africa.\" Previous trackers have relied on batteries which have failed after the migration's first year, leaving a question mark over when the ospreys are likely to return and by which route.

It had all the hallmarks of an era which the government was at pains to discredit: it was pragmatic and pluralist; it gave equal legitimacy to the claims of business and unions; and it had a governing council which, in its tripartite composition, recognised that there were more ways than one of looking at important issues. </p> <p>Yet survival has not required the agency to pay too high a price. That it has changed the time and resources allocated to its traditional, dispute-resolution work is without doubt. But this was largely reactive, in response to the long-term decline in collective bargaining and, in the 1990s, the dramatic fall in industrial disputes. </p> <p>Where is Acas going today? The new, statutory duty in the Employment Relations Act 1999 restores industrial relations to its old prominence - although it is not clear, through omission, how far collective bargaining has also been restored as at least one instrument of improvement. An obvious limitation is the greatly diminished scope of collective bargaining compared to the mid-1970s, or even the beginning of the 1990s. </p> <p>Some of this ground may be made up over the next decade, but a return to earlier levels is highly improbable. </p> <p>However, Acas's future may lie in other directions. First, the agency is well equipped - both through experience and inclination - to carry out a key role under the act's union recognition procedure. It is a role which may keep it very busy, as it is likely that union applicants for recognition will wish to exhaust the negotiated recognition possibilities before seeking the automatic and ballot routes. It may also be that, more often than not, employers will see advantages in voluntary outcomes. </p> <p>Second, conciliation in employment relations has been a major growth area since Acas was founded. New jurisdiction relating to working time and the minimum wage has recently been added to the list, and unfair dismissal cases are likely to resume their growth following the reduction in the qualifying period for applications from two years to one. </p> <p>Third, the government and the act are firmly committed to encouraging partnership at work, although in both academic and practitioner circles there is as yet no consensus as to its meaning. Acas has some experience of promoting partnership through its advisory mediation work, and this route may provide scope for the agency to develop its proactive profolio. </p> <p>Finally, but very speculatively, the government may have firmly set its face against the EU-wide extension of national works councils, but this does not necessarily exclude their future implementation. </p> <p>The present proposals apply to workplaces of 50 or more employees, which fits uneasily with the small firms' exclusion of fewer than 21 under the current rules. But such problems are resolvable. </p> <p>An Acas involvement in facilitating the implementation of national works councils would not be wholly unlike its original duty to encourage collective bargaining - or, at least, to provide a complement to it.
