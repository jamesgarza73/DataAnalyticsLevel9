He could do with just a little less frenzy and a dash more of his dad's intensity (that inevitable comparison) but he deserves to become a major figure in his own right. </p> <p> Robin Denselow</p> <p> ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible</p>",

If I talked to him in a meeting, I had to think of him just as my boss. I learned to switch off by remembering how we used to work together before we started our affair.

We went from months of flirting to having sex wherever we could at work without being caught.

I was worried people would twig, so I ended it because I needed work more than I needed sex. With hindsight, I think I'd still have had the affair, but I would have taken the sex outside work.

Everyone thought we were together already because we were both flirts, but I didn't tell anybody when it started because having an affair at work is a bit like being a celebrity in a small space - everyone wants to know about it and you know they're all imagining you having sex. So what did I learn? That you have to set boundaries. I should have made it clear from the start that I didn't want to take our relationship into the office.

More than 100 of its 140 journalists and marketing staff have volunteered to keep showing up in the office even though the company cannot pay them. While Marshall Davidson, the former investment banker chairman of the company, scrambles to raise more money for his brainchild, for a week now staff members have stood by him. His backers, a variety of venture capitalists that have already coughed up $27m (\u00a318m), have told him to find a media partner to support his venture which is working on an break-even target of early 2002, four years after it was established. The plight of APBnews.com, famed for uncovering Frank Sinatra's FBI file, comes amid signs that companies and investors are growing more wary about the dot.com sector. On Monday, California-based Hollywood Entertainment Corp pulled the plug on its Reel.com arm, an online seller of films and provider of news about the industry. Reel.com had secured some funding from outside investors two years ago but attempts to raise new backing this time round failed. It is a trend many more dot.com companies had been forecast to join after the collapse of British online retailer Boo.com.

The key for survival will be convincing potential investors that the strategy can work and allowing them to differentiate from the array of dot.com business being set up. APBnews, for instance, is trying show that it is not throwing away money, insisting that by the time it reaches its scheduled break-even in the first quarter of 2002 it will have spent $60m, small beer in the terms of many dot.com start-ups. \"We always said it would take four years [to break even].

      "body": "<p>When designer Jane Rodgers was called up by the boss of an internet start-up serving the film industry, she thought she knew what she was in for. \"I researched the guy and his previous businesses, bought a new suit and lied to my boss about having to leave early for a doctor's appointment on Tuesday evening.\" </p> <p>Rodgers met her prospective new employer not in his office but in a bar in Hoxton, an up-and-coming area of east London. \"Imagine my surprise when, after five minutes of chitchat, first date questions really, he leaned towards me, stared earnestly into my eyes and told me: 'Jane, I think you're the one.' I felt like it was me as a person that was being scrutinised.\" He had neither seen her CV nor told her what the job involved, but he was determined to hire her. She declined the offer. </p> <p>In fact, Rodgers' experience is not as unusual as it sounds. As the skills shortage in the new economy spirals out of control, your CV is likely to be the last thing on a prospective employer's mind. Last weekend, a study presented to the American Psychological Society in Miami revealed that most interviewers decide within a minute whether someone is suitable for the job. </p> <p>But this is by no means an American trend. Stressed-out British executives, faced with the longest working hours in Europe, are waking up to the wisdom of employing people who may not be qualified for the job but at least will be fun to work with when the team has to pull off an all-nighter. </p> <p>\"Personality is becoming increasingly important,\" observes Andrew Swift of recruitment consultants Price Jamieson. \"There's a chronic staff skills shortage in areas such as new media, so companies are looking at who will fit in with their culture, rather than who has experience. Technology is changing so fast anyway that there's no point recruiting people who have today's skills. What we need are people with creative, dynamic personalities who are not afraid to push forward into the unknown. Traditional interview rules are all well and good, but when people need staff in a hurry, they learn the benefits of intuition.\" </p> <p>So is the job interview dead? Not quite. But research from the University of Toledo in America reveals that only the first 15 seconds really matter. Researchers interviewed 98 volunteers of various ages and backgrounds for 20 minutes; each interviewer then filled out a six-page evaluation of the candidate. Originally the study was to establish whether applicants who had been coached in body language would get better ratings than those who hadn't (they didn't) - but then another student decided to use the interview videos to test out the idea that \"the handshake is everything\". She took 15 seconds of footage, showing applicants as they knocked on the door, came in, shook the hand of the interviewer and sat down. Then she got a series of strangers to rate the applicants based on that clip, using the same criteria as were used in the longer interviews. Even with such a short tape, their ratings were very similar. </p> <p>London-based psychologist Ros Taylor has just interviewed the chief executives of 80 blue-chip companies about the human side of running a successful business. \"Really, to make a good impression, you don't even get time to open your mouth,\" she says, pointing out that often employers will be observing a candidate from the moment they park their car outside the office. \"An interviewer's response to you will generally be pre-verbal - how you walk through the door, what your posture is like, whether you smile, whether you have a captivating aura, whether you have a firm, confident handshake. You've got about half a minute to make an impact and after that all you are doing is building on a good or bad first impression.\" Thirty seconds is hardly enough time to think consciously, Taylor adds: \"It's a very emotional response.\" </p> <p>The New Yorker recently looked into this issue. Malcolm Gladwell observed that job interviews are increasingly becoming encounters in which charisma and gut reaction are vital. \"Hiring someone is essentially a romantic process. We are looking for someone with whom we have a certain chemistry, we want the unlimited promise of a love affair. The stuctured interview, by contrast, seems to offer only the dry logic and practicality of an arranged marriage.\" </p> <p>Ben Williams, an occupational psychologist involved in interview training, doesn't agree that a candidate has the luxury of 30 seconds. \"I'd argue that it's more like a third of a second, which is basic human reaction time. In that time, like animals, we make a judgment based on whether there is a perceived threat, in which case our instinct is to run, or a favourable response, when we feel it's safe to approach. Everything that happens after only backs that up.\" </p> <p>Experts like Williams are often called in by employers to bring a more objective approach to recruitment; intuition is not a skill he seeks to encourage in his clients. \"Things like psychometric testing are designed to limit the effect of first impressions. We also train interviewers to be aware of the 'halo effect' - when you instantly like someone and everything they subsequently reveal becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because you only want to believe the good stuff.\" </p> <p>Psychologists call this tendency to fixate on character traits and overlook context the Fundamental Attribution Error - that the way a person will behave in an interview situation reflects the way that person will always behave. In other words, we don't need to know someone in order to believe that we do know them. </p> <p>Addie Churchill, who runs a PR company with clients including Carlton TV and Disney, admits she always goes on gut feeling. \"It sounds like a dangerous thing to rely on but I have learned the hard way that if you get a strong vibe about someone, 99% of the time it's accurate. I recently hired an account executive within moments of him walking through the door. I knew he was the right person because we just clicked, but I also knew he didn't have the right experience, that it would take three months to knock him into shape. It was the right decision. It happens the other way round, of course - you instantly know someone is wrong for the job but have to go through the interview process anyway. Using gut feeling isn't risky, but you need to know how to use it.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the job interview itself has become an outmoded concept. There's a joke doing the rounds of personnel departments at the moment. A human resources officer gets a call from Satan: would she like to work in Hell? She pops down for a meeting and likes what she sees - wild partying and champagne flowing. \"OK, when do I start?\" On Monday morning when she reports for work, Hell is a very different place. There's no party, everyone is depressed. \"What's happened to this place?\" she asks. Satan laughs. \"Oh that - that was just the job interview. You're an employee now.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>It would be stretching a point to say that not since the country went to war with Britain over Jenkins' ear has one part of one man's anatomy caused such a stir in Spain. But, for concerned Spanish fans, the case of Raul Gonzalez Blanco's thigh has been no laughing matter. On that collection of muscles rests a good deal of a nation's hopes. </p> <p>From Santander to Cadiz sangrias will have been sunk at the news that the brilliant young Real Madrid forward is fit to face Norway tonight. The injury he sustained in helping his club win the Champions League final will not prevent him trying to inspire his country to a similar success. This could be some summer for a player who does not turn 23 until next week. </p> <p>Asking the Spanish whether Raul is a genius is like questioning whether the earth is round. The man himself is quiet and unassuming but plenty are happy to blow his trumpet for him. Take the midfield metronome Pep Guardiola for a start: \"For me, there's no discussion,\" he said. \"He is the most important player in Spanish football, the one who is going to break records.\" </p> <p>Even at a low-key training session in Tegelen, near the German border, it was easy in flashes to see why. Everything is done at pace and with intent. The tricks do not slither into over-indulgence.

      "bodyText": "It would be stretching a point to say that not since the country went to war with Britain over Jenkins' ear has one part of one man's anatomy caused such a stir in Spain. But, for concerned Spanish fans, the case of Raul Gonzalez Blanco's thigh has been no laughing matter. On that collection of muscles rests a good deal of a nation's hopes. From Santander to Cadiz sangrias will have been sunk at the news that the brilliant young Real Madrid forward is fit to face Norway tonight. The injury he sustained in helping his club win the Champions League final will not prevent him trying to inspire his country to a similar success. This could be some summer for a player who does not turn 23 until next week. Asking the Spanish whether Raul is a genius is like questioning whether the earth is round. The man himself is quiet and unassuming but plenty are happy to blow his trumpet for him. Take the midfield metronome Pep Guardiola for a start: \"For me, there's no discussion,\" he said. \"He is the most important player in Spanish football, the one who is going to break records.\" Even at a low-key training session in Tegelen, near the German border, it was easy in flashes to see why. Everything is done at pace and with intent. The tricks do not slither into over-indulgence. His posse of local female fans, dressed in golden crowns and screaming his name, seemed impressed by the audacious chip that almost caught out the Valencia keeper Jose Canizares. Team-mates certainly like what they see. Raul offers not just talent but teamwork and guts.

      "body": "<p>The strength of English football was tested in Eindhoven last night and gets another close examination today. Kevin Keegan's boys may be resting but Norway are able deputies. Nine of their 22-man squad play in England. </p> <p>Five are likely to start against Spain, and another two - the defenders Andre Bergdolmo and Bjorn Otto Bragstad - have been linked with summer moves to England. The contrast with their opponents could scarcely be greater. All of Jose Antonio Camacho's players are based in Spain. </p> <p>So diverse are the two teams' styles that Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has described this as a meeting between \"night and day\". Just how crude Norway are has been a matter of feverish debate in recent days. Trond Sollied, one of the country's most respected coaches who takes charge of Bruges next season, claimed: \"If everyone played like Norway no one would watch international matches.\" Nils Johan Semb, the Norway coach, offered an angry response. </p> <p>There is more sophistication now than under Egil Olsen but the 4-5-1 formation and physical, hard-working basis remains. \"Norway are going to be the toughest side we face in the group stage,\" Guardiola said after a video viewing. \"Our styles are so different, it's like night playing day. Their way of playing is going to cause a lot of problems for us and we'll have to be at full concentration for 90 minutes.\" </p> <p>All the more so because Norway's two wide midfielders, most likely Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the Valencia-bound John Carew, turn 4-5-1 into 4-3-3 on the counter-attack and have a habit of interchanging positions with Tore Andre Flo. Some Spaniards fear for the Real Madrid centre-back Fernando Hierro, who has played only 90 minutes of football since March. </p> <p>\"Tiredness will not be a factor,\" insisted Guardiola. \"For us, the problem has always been a mental one.\" </p> <p>Spain hope their right-back Michel Salgado will recover from an ankle problem. Henning Berg should play at the centre of a Norway defence said to lack pace without the absent Ronny Johnsen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The strength of English football was tested in Eindhoven last night and gets another close examination today. Kevin Keegan's boys may be resting but Norway are able deputies. Nine of their 22-man squad play in England. Five are likely to start against Spain, and another two - the defenders Andre Bergdolmo and Bjorn Otto Bragstad - have been linked with summer moves to England. The contrast with their opponents could scarcely be greater. All of Jose Antonio Camacho's players are based in Spain. So diverse are the two teams' styles that Barcelona's Pep Guardiola has described this as a meeting between \"night and day\". Just how crude Norway are has been a matter of feverish debate in recent days. Trond Sollied, one of the country's most respected coaches who takes charge of Bruges next season, claimed: \"If everyone played like Norway no one would watch international matches.\" Nils Johan Semb, the Norway coach, offered an angry response. There is more sophistication now than under Egil Olsen but the 4-5-1 formation and physical, hard-working basis remains. \"Norway are going to be the toughest side we face in the group stage,\" Guardiola said after a video viewing. \"Our styles are so different, it's like night playing day. Their way of playing is going to cause a lot of problems for us and we'll have to be at full concentration for 90 minutes.\" All the more so because Norway's two wide midfielders, most likely Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the Valencia-bound John Carew, turn 4-5-1 into 4-3-3 on the counter-attack and have a habit of interchanging positions with Tore Andre Flo. Some Spaniards fear for the Real Madrid centre-back Fernando Hierro, who has played only 90 minutes of football since March. \"Tiredness will not be a factor,\" insisted Guardiola. \"For us, the problem has always been a mental one.\" Spain hope their right-back Michel Salgado will recover from an ankle problem. Henning Berg should play at the centre of a Norway defence said to lack pace without the absent Ronny Johnsen.",

It comes out and Yugoslavia win a free-kick from deep on the right after Mihajlovic is hacked down by Karic.

      "bodyText": "An investigation was ordered today into a 78-year-old pathologist whose medical blunders have had \"serious\" results for seven patients and led to hundreds more being wrongly diagnosed. James Elwood tonight finally agreed to cooperate with health bosses after being accused of \"callous\" and \"reprehensible\" behaviour for repeatedly refusing to pass on details of his employment history which could help track down more of his medical errors. Health secretary Alan Milburn ordered the Commission for Health Improvement to investigate how Dr Elwood was allowed to work as a locum at four hospitals until last year, despite concerns being raised about his performance as early as 1995. Dr Elwood said tonight: \"I am deeply sorry if I have been the cause of distress and suffering to patients as a result of my work at the Swindon and Marlborough NHS Trust. \"I will be cooperating fully with the trust in their review of this matter.\" The extent of the scandal was revealed as the government announced a new \"early warning system\" for detecting medical errors and incompetent doctors. Doctors, nurses and medical staff will have to report all \"adverse incidents\" and medical \"near misses\" to a national database which will then investigate and publish details of errors. The chief medical officer for England, Professor Liam Donaldson, said the new system, similar to that used by the aviation industry to report near misses, would catch cases such as Dr Elwood before they developed into major problems. More than 10,000 biopsies and tissue tests diagnosed by the pathologist at the Princess Margaret Hospital, Swindon, between 1995 and 1999 have had to be reviewed after concerns were raised about his performance. The hospital said diagnostic errors in seven patients have had \"serious consequences\" and a further 215 people have had their diagnoses changed after the review.

The Mid-Sussex Hospital in Haywards Heath, Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey and the Royal United Bath Hospital all employed Dr Elwood. Health chiefs said that Dr Elwood had repeatedly ignored requests for him to send details of other hospitals where he had worked as a locum so that other possible mistakes could be unearthed. And he managed to evade possible disciplinary procedures by voluntarily erasing himself from the medical register last year after he was confronted with accusations of his mistakes. Dr Elwood is still receiving an NHS pension but would only be able to work again if he applied for restoration to the register. The General Medical Council said he would then immediately be subject to their \"fitness to practice\" procedures.",

      "bodyText": "MI5 was today criticised by the parliamentary committee overseeing the intelligence agencies over its failure to prosecute the KGB spy Melita Norwood. The decision to spare 87-year-old Mrs Norwood was taken by a relatively junior MI5 officer. The then head of the service, Dame Stella Rimington, was not even informed of her existence. The security service should have also alerted ministers to its coup in receiving a vast archive of Soviet secrets from defector Vasili Mitrokhin, the intelligence and security committee said. Mr Mitrokhin defected in 1992, bringing with him thousands of documents copied over many years from the KGB archives. Home Secretary Jack Straw today said that the government accepted all of the committee's recommendations but insisted that it had uncovered no evidence that democratic oversight of MI5 was inadequate. The committee said MI5 had allowed the case of Mrs Norwood - who had passed nuclear secrets to the Russians - to \"slip out of sight\" for five years. In its report on the affair published today the committee said that it was a \"serious failure by MI5 not to refer the case to the law officers\". It said the failure to consult the law officers resulted in the decision whether or not to prosecute Mrs Norwood effectively being taken by the Security Service (MI5). \"The committee is concerned that the service used public interest reasons to justify taking no further action against Mrs Norwood when this was for the law officers to decide.\" The committee also made similar criticisms over MI5's handling of the case of a second Soviet spy in Britain, John Symonds. Mrs Norwood's case only became public last year when a book based on his material by Professor Christopher Andrew was serialized in The Times and featured in a BBC TV series. Mr Straw ordered the committee, chaired by Tory former defence secretary Tom King, to investigate the handling of the affair after a public outcry over the failure to prosecute Mrs Norwood and other spies identified by Mr Mitrokhin. The report strongly criticised the way the book was published and said that the events surrounding the release of the material were \"confused\".",

      "body": "<p><strong>NOT HOME YET</strong></p> <p>The Fiver is still sick to the stomach this afternoon. How could we not have included a fourth option (\"England play alright but are still out-thought and beaten by a better side\") amongst yesterday's predictions? Guess we'll never know. Much like Kelvin Koogan, who appears to be completely non-plussed as to why his England side were beaten by Portugal after taking a two-goal lead.</p> <p>\"We both tried to hurt each other by playing football and they won,\" said Koogan this afternoon, confirming what many onlookers had suspected. Denying that England were tactically lacking, he went on: \"I didn't think we underestimated them because we knew what they were about. I didn't think we got the breaks but they played well.\"</p> <p>So Koogan knew that Portugal could pass the ball all day, and that their best players were in midfield. Yet he chose to allow England to be outnumbered in this key area of the field in the belief that, by playing to their own strengths, England would win. To be fair, the tactic worked. For 20 minutes. If the lesson of the remaining 70 is that England are not good enough to beat Portugal, then no wonder Koogan is unwilling to learn it.</p> <p>Koog said today that England will go into Saturday's reasonably-sized game with Germany without the injured pair of Steve McManaman and defensive rock(y) Tony Adams, the latter not even expected to recover in time for the Romanian game. What's more, Koogan insisted: \"I have a style of management and that is not going to change. It would be going against myself and my beliefs.\" So don't expect England to drop the Kick'n'rush v2.0 tactics any time soon. But you never know, it might just work.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEVILLES' HELL</strong></p> <p>Last night, the talented and attractive England defenders Phil and Gary Neville showcased their skills in front of an amazed European audience. But being able to send the ball spinning into touch with one swing of the shin isn't enough for some people, and seasoned observers are suggesting that Kelvin Koogan should be looking for some other full-backs. Ones with talent, perhaps. But one particularly seasoned observer doesn't agree with such a ridiculous argument.</p> <p>\"The fact that the right is patently Phil's stronger foot invites discussion about whether he is the best choice left-back,\" bellowed Alex Ferguson in the general direction of the Manchester Evening News today. \"There isn't exactly a crowd of outstanding left-footed candidates vying for his place,\" reasoned Phil's club manager before getting unreasonably bitchy. \"Talk of drafting in Gareth Barry of Aston Villa is rash... the boy's pace is unexceptional.\"</p> <p>Fergie also had time to stick up for Phil's marginally-better-but-let's-keep-that-in-context brother Gary, who had a not-useless game last night. \"Gary's miseries with United in Brazil last January have blinded a lot of people to the general pattern of his form,\" he kindly explained to all of us too dim to comprehend information ourselves. \"I admit I am inclined to be loyal to such a model professional, but loyalty only goes so far.\" Does that mean we can pick someone else, then? \"Ultimately performance decides everything and Gary has performed.\" Sorry, stupid of us to ask.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"England would sometimes do far better if they played with a goalkeeper. Keegan insists on starting with that piece of meat with eyes called Seaman\" - Madrid's AS newspaper offers its independent assessment of the custodian that knocked Spain out of Euro 96.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>IT'LL BE ALL RIGHTS ON TOMORROW NIGHT</strong></p> <p>Bad news Richard Keys fans, the latest rumour a-burning up the media grapevine suggests that BSkyB may not win the right to screen live Premiership games from the 2001-2 season. Keys, the offspring of a human being and a moustachioed mandrill (hang on, that was a dream), will have to look for new work if his current employers lose the right to fill our face with unnecessary on-screen graphics every other night. And that will be a shame.</p> <p>An announcement from the Premier League is expected tomorrow as to the winners in the race to snap up various different Premiership rights packages. The most valuable of these is the contract to show 66 live Premiership matches a season. Sky had been earmarked as favourites for this package, as they already hold the contract and have a good working relationship with the clubs. However, an report in London's Evening Standard suggests that each of the main bidders has passed the League's quality control tests and that the winning bid will simply be the one that offers the most money (not too dissimilar to George Graham's old Scandinavian shopping policy).</p> <p>Usually this would be good news for Sky, what with possessing pockets as deep as an episode of Dawson's Creek. However, cheeky cable upstarts NTL are even more flush (see their tie-up with Rangers below) and are tipped to snatch the rights. If any company bids more than 5% higher than their nearest competitor they win the rights outright (right?). If not then League chief executive Richard Scudamore can ask for more bids. The winners will be announced tomorrow evening. Nervous Mr Keys?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Arsenal are tracking \u00a35m-rated Brazilian defender Edmilson. Arsene Wenger apparently sees the Sao Paolo player as a replacement for Tony Adams when he retires, and recently visited South America to examine the player. According to Edmilson: \"Wenger talked with me and other players, but if the transfer business does not carry through, the fact there has been interest from a coach such as Arsene already leaves me happy.\"</p> <p>Muzzy Izzet has played down speculation linking him with Spurs and Celtic. \"I haven't even thought about leaving Leicester,\" he said. \"We have money to spend and we are in the Uefa Cup. We are also having a new stadium built, so things are looking good.\"</p> <p>The exodus from Aston Villa continues. Sunderland are interested in Ugo Ehiogu and Steve Watson, and could offer out-of-favour full-back Michael Gray as a make-weight in the deal.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>David Beckham will face no punishment for making a one-fingered gesture to England fans after last night's match in Eindhoven. FA spokesman Steve Double explained: \"As the team left the pitch some of the players were subjected to disgusting, foul-mouthed abuse from a small group who we would hesitate to describe as England fans. We would have liked to have seen them arrested for their behaviour. We believe they were drunk.\"</p> <p>Rangers have signed a \u00a331m media and commercial partnership with club sponsors NTL. The two parties have also formed a joint venture which will operate any prospective Rangers TV channel as well as internet and e-commerce services. Celtic were rumoured to be making a mirror announcement to Rangers but are still in talks and have announced that teaming up with NTL is not their only possible option.</p> <p>Huey Lewis and The News have been forced to reschedule a concert in Copenhagen to avoid a clash with Denmark's Euro 2000 match against Holland. \"The power of football is stronger than The Power of Love,\" quipped a spokesman for concert venue Tivoli Gardens, to absolutely no laughter.</p> <p>Euro 2000 has spawned a betting market with a daily turnover of 100 million leks in Albanian capital Tirana. Some 100 professional gamblers have set up shop in Tirana's Palace of Culture, a relic of the communist past of Europe's poorest nation. The bookies are breaking the law but are unlikely to be disturbed by the police.</p> <p>Bolton defender Mike Whitlow and midfielder Claus Jensen have been cleared of misconduct charges by the FA. Both players were charged following incidents in Bolton's play-off second leg against Ipswich.</p> <p>Draw for the first round of the CIS Insurance Cup: Queen of South v Forfar, Peterhead v Inverness CT, East Stirling v Hamilton, Queen's Park v Stranraer, Cowdenbeath v Elgin, Stirling v Stenhousemuir, Partick Thistle v Airdrie, Dumbarton v Ayr, Ross County v Albion, Clyde v Morton, East Fife v Raith, Montrose v Berwick, Clydebank v Alloa, Arbroath v Brechin.

      "bodyText": "NOT HOME YET The Fiver is still sick to the stomach this afternoon. How could we not have included a fourth option (\"England play alright but are still out-thought and beaten by a better side\") amongst yesterday's predictions? Guess we'll never know. Much like Kelvin Koogan, who appears to be completely non-plussed as to why his England side were beaten by Portugal after taking a two-goal lead. \"We both tried to hurt each other by playing football and they won,\" said Koogan this afternoon, confirming what many onlookers had suspected. Denying that England were tactically lacking, he went on: \"I didn't think we underestimated them because we knew what they were about. I didn't think we got the breaks but they played well.\" So Koogan knew that Portugal could pass the ball all day, and that their best players were in midfield. Yet he chose to allow England to be outnumbered in this key area of the field in the belief that, by playing to their own strengths, England would win. To be fair, the tactic worked. For 20 minutes. If the lesson of the remaining 70 is that England are not good enough to beat Portugal, then no wonder Koogan is unwilling to learn it. Koog said today that England will go into Saturday's reasonably-sized game with Germany without the injured pair of Steve McManaman and defensive rock(y) Tony Adams, the latter not even expected to recover in time for the Romanian game. What's more, Koogan insisted: \"I have a style of management and that is not going to change. It would be going against myself and my beliefs.\" So don't expect England to drop the Kick'n'rush v2.0 tactics any time soon. But you never know, it might just work. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEVILLES' HELL Last night, the talented and attractive England defenders Phil and Gary Neville showcased their skills in front of an amazed European audience. But being able to send the ball spinning into touch with one swing of the shin isn't enough for some people, and seasoned observers are suggesting that Kelvin Koogan should be looking for some other full-backs. Ones with talent, perhaps. But one particularly seasoned observer doesn't agree with such a ridiculous argument. \"The fact that the right is patently Phil's stronger foot invites discussion about whether he is the best choice left-back,\" bellowed Alex Ferguson in the general direction of the Manchester Evening News today. \"There isn't exactly a crowd of outstanding left-footed candidates vying for his place,\" reasoned Phil's club manager before getting unreasonably bitchy. \"Talk of drafting in Gareth Barry of Aston Villa is rash... the boy's pace is unexceptional.\" Fergie also had time to stick up for Phil's marginally-better-but-let's-keep-that-in-context brother Gary, who had a not-useless game last night. \"Gary's miseries with United in Brazil last January have blinded a lot of people to the general pattern of his form,\" he kindly explained to all of us too dim to comprehend information ourselves. \"I admit I am inclined to be loyal to such a model professional, but loyalty only goes so far.\" Does that mean we can pick someone else, then? \"Ultimately performance decides everything and Gary has performed.\" Sorry, stupid of us to ask. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"England would sometimes do far better if they played with a goalkeeper. Keegan insists on starting with that piece of meat with eyes called Seaman\" - Madrid's AS newspaper offers its independent assessment of the custodian that knocked Spain out of Euro 96. * * * * * * * * * * * * * IT'LL BE ALL RIGHTS ON TOMORROW NIGHT Bad news Richard Keys fans, the latest rumour a-burning up the media grapevine suggests that BSkyB may not win the right to screen live Premiership games from the 2001-2 season. Keys, the offspring of a human being and a moustachioed mandrill (hang on, that was a dream), will have to look for new work if his current employers lose the right to fill our face with unnecessary on-screen graphics every other night. And that will be a shame. An announcement from the Premier League is expected tomorrow as to the winners in the race to snap up various different Premiership rights packages. The most valuable of these is the contract to show 66 live Premiership matches a season. Sky had been earmarked as favourites for this package, as they already hold the contract and have a good working relationship with the clubs. However, an report in London's Evening Standard suggests that each of the main bidders has passed the League's quality control tests and that the winning bid will simply be the one that offers the most money (not too dissimilar to George Graham's old Scandinavian shopping policy). Usually this would be good news for Sky, what with possessing pockets as deep as an episode of Dawson's Creek. However, cheeky cable upstarts NTL are even more flush (see their tie-up with Rangers below) and are tipped to snatch the rights. If any company bids more than 5% higher than their nearest competitor they win the rights outright (right?). If not then League chief executive Richard Scudamore can ask for more bids. The winners will be announced tomorrow evening. Nervous Mr Keys? * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal are tracking \u00a35m-rated Brazilian defender Edmilson. Arsene Wenger apparently sees the Sao Paolo player as a replacement for Tony Adams when he retires, and recently visited South America to examine the player. According to Edmilson: \"Wenger talked with me and other players, but if the transfer business does not carry through, the fact there has been interest from a coach such as Arsene already leaves me happy.\" Muzzy Izzet has played down speculation linking him with Spurs and Celtic. \"I haven't even thought about leaving Leicester,\" he said. \"We have money to spend and we are in the Uefa Cup. We are also having a new stadium built, so things are looking good.\" The exodus from Aston Villa continues. Sunderland are interested in Ugo Ehiogu and Steve Watson, and could offer out-of-favour full-back Michael Gray as a make-weight in the deal. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF David Beckham will face no punishment for making a one-fingered gesture to England fans after last night's match in Eindhoven. FA spokesman Steve Double explained: \"As the team left the pitch some of the players were subjected to disgusting, foul-mouthed abuse from a small group who we would hesitate to describe as England fans. We would have liked to have seen them arrested for their behaviour. We believe they were drunk.\" Rangers have signed a \u00a331m media and commercial partnership with club sponsors NTL. The two parties have also formed a joint venture which will operate any prospective Rangers TV channel as well as internet and e-commerce services. Celtic were rumoured to be making a mirror announcement to Rangers but are still in talks and have announced that teaming up with NTL is not their only possible option. Huey Lewis and The News have been forced to reschedule a concert in Copenhagen to avoid a clash with Denmark's Euro 2000 match against Holland. \"The power of football is stronger than The Power of Love,\" quipped a spokesman for concert venue Tivoli Gardens, to absolutely no laughter. Euro 2000 has spawned a betting market with a daily turnover of 100 million leks in Albanian capital Tirana. Some 100 professional gamblers have set up shop in Tirana's Palace of Culture, a relic of the communist past of Europe's poorest nation. The bookies are breaking the law but are unlikely to be disturbed by the police. Bolton defender Mike Whitlow and midfielder Claus Jensen have been cleared of misconduct charges by the FA. Both players were charged following incidents in Bolton's play-off second leg against Ipswich. Draw for the first round of the CIS Insurance Cup: Queen of South v Forfar, Peterhead v Inverness CT, East Stirling v Hamilton, Queen's Park v Stranraer, Cowdenbeath v Elgin, Stirling v Stenhousemuir, Partick Thistle v Airdrie, Dumbarton v Ayr, Ross County v Albion, Clyde v Morton, East Fife v Raith, Montrose v Berwick, Clydebank v Alloa, Arbroath v Brechin. Ties to be played August 8-9. The SFA have threatened serious disciplinary action against Morton if they fail to settle an outstanding debt of \u00a318,979 owed to Hearts. Morton failed to honour a sell-on clause when selling Kevin Thomas to St Johnstone. Kilmarnock winger David Bagan, 23, has joined Inverness Caledonian Thistle. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Euro 2000 - Live (4.45pm, 1.30am) Right. Watch Spain and Norway here. Then you've got over half-an-hour to prepare a sandwich and eat it before... BBC1: Euro 2000 Match of the Day Live (7.30pm) ... you watch Yugoslavia play Slovenia. Once that's done you can do stuff like interact with other humans. We know it's difficult but don't worry - it'll not be long before you can... ITV: Euro 2000 Today (11.30pm) ... watch both games again in highlight form with Sideshow Bob. At the end of the programme, we recommend a quick shower - you probably reek - but don't spend too much time towelling yourself down after it because... BBC1: Euro 2000 Replay (12.45am) ... you can dry off wrapped in your gown, watching both matches in their entirety again unless... ITV: Euro 2000 The Big Match (1.30am) ...you don't want to look like some sort of crazy football obsessive and just decide to watch the Spanish game again instead before creeping off to bed. British Eurosport: Euro 2000 Football Live (7pm) They cover sport live, you know, and here's the evidence. Euro 2000 Extra (10.15pm) We don't know exactly what this is, but whatever it is there's some more of it. Euro 2000 Nightclub (11.15pm) This probably seemed like a good idea at the time. Sky Sports: aren't even bothering to keep up a pretence of covering Euro 2000. Unlike talkSPORT, that is (hehe). Radio 5 Live: Euro 2000 Live (7pm) Euro Alan!",

PC Joy Hendricks was cleared of attacking the fellow officer with a snooker cue after telling a court that she had acted in self defence after suffering racial abuse from within the force. Black police leaders last night branded as a disgrace the Metropolitan police's decision to axe Ms Hendricks's sick pay. The case highlights concerns over the Met's commitment to stamp out discrimination after the Stephen Lawrence report. Last week the force agreed a \u00a31m settlement with former PC Sarah Locker who left alleging years of sexual and racial discrimination. The decision to stop Ms Hendricks's sick pay was made by Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston and is said to have left Ms Hendricks \"devastated\". She had been off work since March 1999 through illness which, she says, was caused by years of racist and sexual taunts. Sergeant Mark Workman testified before Horseferry Road magistrates court that Ms Hendricks had assaulted him, and his version was supported by another male officer. But last August magistrate Eleri Rees acquitted Ms Hendricks, who told the court Sgt Workman had described her as \"dodgy\" and as \"Stevie Lawrence two\". \"I thought he was going to hit me with the snooker cue so I punched him,\" Ms Hendricks told the court.

How could we not have included a fourth option (\"England play alright but are still out-thought and beaten by a better side\") amongst yesterday's predictions? Guess we'll never know. Much like Kelvin Koogan, who appears to be completely non-plussed as to why his England side were beaten by Portugal after taking a two-goal lead. \"We both tried to hurt each other by playing football and they won,\" said Koogan this afternoon, confirming what many onlookers had suspected. Denying that England were tactically lacking, he went on: \"I didn't think we underestimated them because we knew what they were about. I didn't think we got the breaks but they played well.\" So Koogan knew that Portugal could pass the ball all day, and that their best players were in midfield. Yet he chose to allow England to be outnumbered in this key area of the field in the belief that, by playing to their own strengths, England would win. To be fair, the tactic worked. For 20 minutes. If the lesson of the remaining 70 is that England are not good enough to beat Portugal, then no wonder Koogan is unwilling to learn it. Koog said today that England will go into Saturday's reasonably-sized game with Germany without the injured pair of Steve McManaman and defensive rock(y) Tony Adams, the latter not even expected to recover in time for the Romanian game. What's more, Koogan insisted: \"I have a style of management and that is not going to change. It would be going against myself and my beliefs.\" So don't expect England to drop the Kick'n'rush v2.0 tactics any time soon. But you never know, it might just work. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEVILLES' HELL Last night, the talented and attractive England defenders Phil and Gary Neville showcased their skills in front of an amazed European audience.

      "body": "<p>Nipples that leak yellowish toxic yoghurt; an implant a surgeon kept in the back of a drawer and which now smells like an old chip-fryer - these were some of the stomach-churning insights into the artificial beauty business that emerged when the department of health last week advised 5,000 women with soya bean breast implants to have them taken out. </p> <p>The oil, promoted as a natural alternative to the vilified silicone, may potentially degrade into toxic aldehydes that can cause cancer and birth defects. Beauty is only skin deep indeed. How many women are now left fearfully wondering what is happening underneath their enhanced curves, the D-cup of their dreams? Are their breasts stealthily seeping fermenting carcinogenic fluid? It's like a horror movie in the worst possible taste. </p> <p>There has always been this powerful Frankenstein element about cosmetic surgery. The quest for beauty beyond our genetic inheritance or youth in spite of advancing time can go grotesquely wrong. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, who has been campaigning against cowboy cosmetic surgery clinics for the best part of a decade, has an enormous file of scarred and mutilated women. </p> <p>\"The result was dreadful, resulting in to date five operations to try to rectify the damage he had done,\" says one. Another speaks of \"unbearable pain during surgery, tattoo scars on bellybutton and hips and post-traumatic stress disorder\". </p> <p>Yet even major scandals like that of the Trilucent soya bean implants seem unlikely to stem the flow of candidates for the knife. Barry Jones, president of the Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, who was on the committee that recommended removal of the implants, does not think it will have any impact. \"Although common sense might say 'yes', history would say 'no',\" he says. \"Breast enhancement is a very common and popular operation. Body contour is very important to some people. There are a number of women who are quite disturbed by it.\" </p> <p>The 40 women who have had Trilucent implants at his clinic all received a letter from him on the day of the announcement, inviting them to come and see him and discuss what happens next - they are the lucky ones, because most will have found out via the newspapers and television. Advice from the Medical Devices Agency, which regulates implants, was that the women should not get pregnant or breastfeed until they have been taken out. </p> <p>Among Mr Jones's cohort are one who has had a baby and another who is pregnant. \"They are anxious,\" he says with an element of under-statement. The anxiety will be worsened because he believes nothing immediate can be done. \"I think the right advice is to wait until the breast is not post-pregnancy anymore. Surgery on a lactating breast is quite risky.\" </p> <p>He will do his best to reassure them, because his personal belief is that the Trilucent implants are not a problem until they rupture and the oil meets air and oxidises - which will only happen outside the breast. He wants to involve either the MDA's scientists or the manufacturers in research on the 40 or so implants he will be removing to test the theory. \"When something like this happens, for the individual concerned it is an unfortunate event, but if we don't learn from it, it is even more unfortunate,\" he says. </p> <p>Many women with Trilucent implants will no doubt be thinking of replacing them with silicone or saline. Yet the MDA had no advice for them whatsoever last week. Under heavy questioning Dr Susanne Ludgate, medical director of the MDA, stuck to her statement that they had no evidence as to whether or not it was safe to put in a different kind of implant once the soya bean oil device had been removed. Her argument may be scientifically immaculate, but the women affected may well feel deserted. They are advised to talk to their surgeon, but how are they to trust the cosmetic surgery clinic that sold them their safe and super-natural carcinogenic implant? </p> <p>The fiasco has illuminated a major problem - implants are not licensed. Although these foreign objects which can and do leak and rupture are to be inserted inside a woman's body, they do not have to be tested on people before they come on the market. They do not undergo clinical trials, as drugs must. Instead, they are given the CE mark - a kitemark that shows they meet a European standard, just like cuddly toys and dishwashers. </p> <p>There are a number of commercial agencies around Europe, although mostly in Germany and the UK, that can hand out this kitemark, and they are approved by governmental bodies like the MDA here. But if TUV Munich - as happened with Trilucent - says an implant is OK, under European law the UK government is not supposed to interfere with it being sold here. </p> <p>Some countries don't play the game. \"The French just say 'non',\" says Mr Jones. They make unilateral decisions. Like the United States, they banned silicone breast implants. But the UK sticks to the rules. The MDA now says it is pressing Europe to strengthen them, and to introduce a requirement for clinical trials for implants. None too soon. </p> <p>There is a fashion in cosmetic surgery, and right now top of the list is lip augmentation. Everybody wants Liz Hurley's pouting mouth (although she says hers is natural). But according to Mr Jones, none of the techniques used currently are very good. </p> <p>Collagen injections are temporary - the stuff just disappears into the body. And then there are implants. The main lip implant used was marketed very heavily and directly to the public. Jones says: \"I didn't use a lot of it - less than 10 patients. Most of them had to be revised.\" </p> <p>He had to bring them back in for further surgery either to remove or alter the implant in some way. \"You can always feel it,\" he says, \"and you can often see it. Sometimes the ends of it will be apparent.\" </p> <p>He is not alone in his experience. A respected plastic surgeon called Claude Lassus, who operates in Nice, told the recent International Confederation of Plastic Surgeons that he used quite a lot of the implants and had to remove most of them. </p> <p>Other techniques, such as face-lifts and tummy tucks, should not in themselves be cause for concern, says Mr Jones, but implants are a problem because they are not properly tested and regulated, and so are cowboy surgeons. Anybody can set up a cosmetic surgery clinic and call themselves a consultant and operate on people as long as they don't claim to be a doctor, points out Ann Clwyd. \"I think there are lots of cowboys operating in the private cosmetic industry. They ought to be regulated and patients ought to be protected. </p> <p>\"Sir Norman Browse, a past president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said animals are better protected than humans - you have to be a qualified vet to operate on animals.\" </p> <p>Clwyd knows of one woman who had liposuction carried out by a GP, who gave her a general anaesthetic without an anaesthetist, while she was lying in a dentist's chair. The woman says she came round towards the end of the operation and was in agony. But even if a qualified Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons is conducting the procedure, it doesn't mean he has done any training in plastic surgery; he could be a gynaecologist or ENT specialist. </p> <p>Jones believes things will change radically in a few years time, once revalidation is underway - doctors will not be allowed to practice either in the NHS or the private sector unless they can prove to the satisfaction of the General Medical Council that they are up to standard every five years. </p> <p>Two more changes are needed to clean up the cosmetic surgery business, he says. Ads in the back of glossy magazines and newspapers should be banned from using photos of attractive bodies. \"You don't need a picture of a pretty pair of breasts to know what they look like,\" he says. \"That is to entice.\" Clinics should also be banned from using a lay counsellor to screen customers - only surgeons can advise the patient as to whether the operation is right or wrong for her. \"We are very anxious to improve the situation. In the mainstream, I'm sure they are practising properly and the surgeons are properly trained,\" he says. </p> <p>But change seems to take forever in cosmetic surgery. There have been any number of scandals. The Consumers Association produced a damning report in October 1997 after sending a couple of models into clinics, wired for sound to experience the hard-sell. </p> <p>It is widely accepted that many people who go to the clinics are deeply vulnerable, with very low self-esteem and often nobody to talk to because they are ashamed to tell their families and friends what they are doing. The House of Commons health select committee expressed many anxieties two years ago about misleading advertisements, inadequate information to customers and under-trained surgeons. </p> <p>The government now says it will tackle some of these issues in the forthcoming Care Standards Bill. What no regulation can achieve is any change in the culture of glossy, busty, pouting Hollywood models and actresses which is imbibed by vulnerable young girls and boys and makes them risk their health for the sake of a more exotic body which is unlikely, in the end, to make them happy. Why else do the clinics universally require payment in advance?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nipples that leak yellowish toxic yoghurt; an implant a surgeon kept in the back of a drawer and which now smells like an old chip-fryer - these were some of the stomach-churning insights into the artificial beauty business that emerged when the department of health last week advised 5,000 women with soya bean breast implants to have them taken out. The oil, promoted as a natural alternative to the vilified silicone, may potentially degrade into toxic aldehydes that can cause cancer and birth defects. Beauty is only skin deep indeed. How many women are now left fearfully wondering what is happening underneath their enhanced curves, the D-cup of their dreams? Are their breasts stealthily seeping fermenting carcinogenic fluid? It's like a horror movie in the worst possible taste. There has always been this powerful Frankenstein element about cosmetic surgery. The quest for beauty beyond our genetic inheritance or youth in spite of advancing time can go grotesquely wrong. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, who has been campaigning against cowboy cosmetic surgery clinics for the best part of a decade, has an enormous file of scarred and mutilated women. \"The result was dreadful, resulting in to date five operations to try to rectify the damage he had done,\" says one. Another speaks of \"unbearable pain during surgery, tattoo scars on bellybutton and hips and post-traumatic stress disorder\". Yet even major scandals like that of the Trilucent soya bean implants seem unlikely to stem the flow of candidates for the knife. Barry Jones, president of the Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, who was on the committee that recommended removal of the implants, does not think it will have any impact. \"Although common sense might say 'yes', history would say 'no',\" he says. \"Breast enhancement is a very common and popular operation. Body contour is very important to some people. There are a number of women who are quite disturbed by it.\" The 40 women who have had Trilucent implants at his clinic all received a letter from him on the day of the announcement, inviting them to come and see him and discuss what happens next - they are the lucky ones, because most will have found out via the newspapers and television.

Sleeping under a mosquito net, especially one sprayed with the chemical permethrin, is a good idea, as is burning a coil which releases smoke and rubbing repellent creams onto exposed bits.

Can you reassure me? </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> Coronation Street has highlighted a potentially serious bacterial infection called Group B streptococcus (GBS for short). Estimates vary, but around 5-10% of us carry this bug. A tiny but unpredictable proportion of pregnant women carry a virulent type in their vagina which can pass to the baby during labour, causing life-threatening blood poisoning (septicaemia) to mother and baby. GBS can be detected by a vaginal swab. It is treated by giving antibiotics into a vein during labour. Treating it earlier in pregnancy with oral antibiotics is too unreliable. Only those considered to be at high risk are screened in this country: pregnant women with vaginal discharge; evidence of GBS - eg in the urine; those who get a sudden temperature during labour or those who've had previous unexplained rupture of membranes and premature labour. It is likely that all pregnant women will soon be offered a vaginal swab.

The fact is that many caucasians with high blood pressure have high levels of renin, a hormone produced by the kidneys. Two groups of drugs commonly used to treat high blood pressure, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, work by lowering this renin level. But many black people share an inherited disposition to low renin levels and so these drugs don't tend to work well.

      "body": "<p>Here comes summer, just about, and despite years of vigorous health campaigns many of us will still be surrendering our milky-white bodies to the mercy of the sun. We find it hard to give up burning our flesh, even though it is now as much maligned as smoking or stuffing down cream cakes. One 1997 survey showed that despite high levels of awareness about the dangers, more than a third of men and around half of women who did not have a naturally black or brown skin had tried to get a tan the previous year. </p> <p>Ironically, people say that a good roasting improves their sense of wellbeing, and that a tan makes them feel healthy, sexy even. Are they right? Could sunbathing be good for us? If this article were being written in the early 1900s the health-giving aspects of the sun would be exalted. </p> <p>It was found during the first world war that wounds healed quicker if left exposed to the sun, and patients with tuberculosis were healed in clinics where they were wheeled out onto balconies or into solariums. In the 1930s, sunbathing was encouraged as a public health measure. Heliotherapy (sun therapy) was also used to treat rickets, burns, varicose ulcers, osteomyelitis (an infection of bone), septic abscesses, anaemia and fractures. </p> <p>Archive photographs of sunbathing hospital patients now look bizarre in an era when we are told that there is no such thing as a healthy tan and that we should cake ourselves in SFP 15 sunscreen and avoid exposure between 11am and 3pm. Those, however, were the days before antibiotics, when anything that apparently boosted the immune system had to be taken very seriously. </p> <p>Sunlight has the ability to kill bacteria, even when it passes through glass, and it has been found that patients recover faster in sunny hospital wards. \"In the right hands, sunlight is a medicine,\" claims Richard Hobday, author of The Healing Sun (Findhorn Press \u00a39.95), a new book which explores the beneficial effect of sun on our health, and hopes to redress what the author sees as our current bias against sunlight. \"Each year lack of sunlight probably kills many thousands more people in this country and others at similar latitudes than skin cancer,\" he says. </p> <p>The sun is certainly a natural healer, so it's not surprising that this call for its reinstatement comes from those whose sympathies are based in complementary therapy: Hobday is trained in traditional Chinese medicine, and the book is published by Findhorn, the New Age community in Scotland. </p> <p>However, his dramatic assertions are also echoed by four epidemiologists from the department of social medicine at Bristol University. Their article \"Are we really dying for a tan?\", published in the British Medical Journal last summer, controversially claimed that \"the exact nature of the association between malignant melanoma and exposure to sunlight has to be determined\", and that \"there is evidence that the potential benefits of exposure to sunlight may outweigh the widely publicised adverse effects on the incidence of skin cancer\". </p> <p>Hobday, who is a doctor of engineering, became interested in sunlight as medicine when investigating solar energy technologies, and learnt of a lost tradition of designing sunlit buildings to prevent disease. \"Also I am particularly fond of sunbathing and only feel fit and well when I have a tan,\" he says. </p> <p>The fact that sunlight enables us to manufacture vitamin D is key to its health giving properties. Vitamin D is essential for the growth and maintenance of teeth and bones and a healthy immune system.

      "bodyText": "Here comes summer, just about, and despite years of vigorous health campaigns many of us will still be surrendering our milky-white bodies to the mercy of the sun. We find it hard to give up burning our flesh, even though it is now as much maligned as smoking or stuffing down cream cakes. One 1997 survey showed that despite high levels of awareness about the dangers, more than a third of men and around half of women who did not have a naturally black or brown skin had tried to get a tan the previous year. Ironically, people say that a good roasting improves their sense of wellbeing, and that a tan makes them feel healthy, sexy even. Are they right? Could sunbathing be good for us? If this article were being written in the early 1900s the health-giving aspects of the sun would be exalted. It was found during the first world war that wounds healed quicker if left exposed to the sun, and patients with tuberculosis were healed in clinics where they were wheeled out onto balconies or into solariums. In the 1930s, sunbathing was encouraged as a public health measure. Heliotherapy (sun therapy) was also used to treat rickets, burns, varicose ulcers, osteomyelitis (an infection of bone), septic abscesses, anaemia and fractures. Archive photographs of sunbathing hospital patients now look bizarre in an era when we are told that there is no such thing as a healthy tan and that we should cake ourselves in SFP 15 sunscreen and avoid exposure between 11am and 3pm. Those, however, were the days before antibiotics, when anything that apparently boosted the immune system had to be taken very seriously. Sunlight has the ability to kill bacteria, even when it passes through glass, and it has been found that patients recover faster in sunny hospital wards. \"In the right hands, sunlight is a medicine,\" claims Richard Hobday, author of The Healing Sun (Findhorn Press \u00a39.95), a new book which explores the beneficial effect of sun on our health, and hopes to redress what the author sees as our current bias against sunlight. \"Each year lack of sunlight probably kills many thousands more people in this country and others at similar latitudes than skin cancer,\" he says. The sun is certainly a natural healer, so it's not surprising that this call for its reinstatement comes from those whose sympathies are based in complementary therapy: Hobday is trained in traditional Chinese medicine, and the book is published by Findhorn, the New Age community in Scotland. However, his dramatic assertions are also echoed by four epidemiologists from the department of social medicine at Bristol University. Their article \"Are we really dying for a tan?\", published in the British Medical Journal last summer, controversially claimed that \"the exact nature of the association between malignant melanoma and exposure to sunlight has to be determined\", and that \"there is evidence that the potential benefits of exposure to sunlight may outweigh the widely publicised adverse effects on the incidence of skin cancer\". Hobday, who is a doctor of engineering, became interested in sunlight as medicine when investigating solar energy technologies, and learnt of a lost tradition of designing sunlit buildings to prevent disease. \"Also I am particularly fond of sunbathing and only feel fit and well when I have a tan,\" he says. The fact that sunlight enables us to manufacture vitamin D is key to its health giving properties. Vitamin D is essential for the growth and maintenance of teeth and bones and a healthy immune system. In Britain we get only a quarter of it from diet (the main sources are margarines and dairy spreads, fatty fish, breakfast cereal and eggs), and the rest from the sun. The evidence is sketchy, but a vitamin D deficiency may be linked to a long list of ailments, including osteoporosis, heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. On skin cancer, of which there are now about 40,000 new cases every year in the UK, Hobday points out rather lightly that the non-melanoma variety, which accounts for a vast number of cases, doesn't matter too much because it is treatable. Malignant melanoma, (about 4,000 cases annually) he argues, is most prevalent amongst people who spend long periods indoors and then go for the burn on their two-week holidays, rather than people who work outdoors.

But if a new study* in microscopic detail of one health area is anything to go by, hundreds of millions of Labour government largesse will be needed to pay the \"financing costs\" of PFI deals. PFI may yet become the ultimate revenge of the capitalist system on public provision by extracting an annual toll for banks, consultants and brokers of the order of 15% of the annual cost of maintaining hospitals.

Worcestershire is an area already under-served in terms of acute beds; once the PFI deal kicks in (the new hospital is due to open in 2002) the relative number of such beds will fall further, to just over half the English average.

In 1996 the board of Worcester royal infirmary committed itself to rebuilding the hospital. The site would be sold and the work done by a consortium including Bovis, the British Linen Bank and others; the hospital board would then lease the building back over 30 years, paying an annual charge.

The government is putting money in specifically to \"smooth\" the impact of PFI costs. Worcester HA has also stepped in to help the hospital by making extensive savings elsewhere. The PFI has only become viable because the Kidderminster hospital will lose its inpatients. (It will not formally close but become an \"ambulatory\" centre, treating outpatients only.)

The 1950-53 Korean war left up to five million people dead, injured or missing, and its legacy lingers most vividly at the DMZ, a buffer area that separates hundreds of thousands of troops, tanks and artillery pieces on both sides of Korea's border.</p> <p>North Korea's government, based on a personality cult that virtually deifies Kim Jong Il and his late father and national founder, Kim Il Sung, had been reclusive for so long that reconciliation seemed a doubtful dream.</p> <p>Yet driven partly by desperation for economic aid to rebuild its dilapidated economy, the North has embarked on a new course over the last year, seeking diplomatic contacts with the outside world that culminated in the decision to host an inter-Korean summit.</p> <p>During the three-day summit, Kim Dae-jung is expected to appeal to his counterpart to agree to reunions of separated families, a summit sequel in the South Korean capital Seoul and other conciliatory gestures in exchange for economic resources from the South.</p> <p>Though endowed with long-range missile capabilities, North Korea was unable to feed its own people and is now reliant on food aid from its traditional foes: South Korea, Japan and the United States.</p> <p>Reunification, the stated goal of both nations, will be difficult. Sensitive issues to resolve include North Korea's missile and nuclear programs, and the 37,000 US troops deployed in South Korea. Their role has been to deter the North, which is believed to have stockpiles of chemical weapons and one of the world's largest standing armies.</p> <p>Often described as one of the most volatile places on Earth, the Korean peninsula has lived with the threat of another war for more than a generation. In 1994, concerns over the North's purported nuclear weapons programme nearly triggered a military conflict.</p> <p>North Korea is hosting the summit in the mysterious style that it has often employed. It delayed the meeting for a day without a clear explanation, and has refused to announce the schedule, possibly out of concern for the security of Kim Jong Il.</p> <p>The two Kims plan to meet today and on at least one other occasion, and their governments have agreed not to use national flags and anthems to avoid political or ideological frictions. North Korea has barred foreign reporters from attending the summit, allowing only 50 South Korean journalists to join President Kim's entourage.</p> <p>The two countries came tantalisingly close to a summit in 1994, but North Korean leader Kim Il Sung died, aged 82, only weeks before he was due to meet his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young-sam.</p>",

      "bodyText": "South Korean President Kim Dae-jung flew to the north of the divided peninsula today for a historic summit that offers the greatest hope for peace in more than 50 years. As he left for the northern capital, Mr Kim said: \"I wholeheartedly hope that my trip to Pyongyang will be on a path toward peace and reconciliation. \"I hope that it will be a turning point in efforts to remove threats to war and terminate the cold war on the Korean peninsula so that all 70m Korean people in the South and North can live in peace.\" South Korean officials said the presidential plane, accompanied by a chartered flight carrying most of the president's 180-member entourage, would make a detour over the sea on a 70-minute trip to Sunan airport near Pyongyang. There is no direct air travel between Korea's capitals, and hundreds of thousands of soldiers are deployed on both sides of the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, which separates the North and South. President Kim said he planned to talk candidly with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, and hoped to learn about the thinking of the reclusive head of the totalitarian regime, though he warned that reconciliation would be a lengthy process. \"I don't believe that we can resolve all problems at one meeting,\" he said. \"We will continue working out agreements whenever our opinions coincide on an issue.\" Leaders of South Korea and North Korea have never met since the two countries were founded in 1948 in the infancy of the cold war, and the conflict between two populations that speak the same language and share the same ethnic roots has been bitter and bloody. Animosity and suspicion remain fresh half a century after the communist North, backed by the Soviet Union and joined by Chinese troops, fought the pro-Western South and its US-led United Nations allies. The 1950-53 Korean war left up to five million people dead, injured or missing, and its legacy lingers most vividly at the DMZ, a buffer area that separates hundreds of thousands of troops, tanks and artillery pieces on both sides of Korea's border. North Korea's government, based on a personality cult that virtually deifies Kim Jong Il and his late father and national founder, Kim Il Sung, had been reclusive for so long that reconciliation seemed a doubtful dream. Yet driven partly by desperation for economic aid to rebuild its dilapidated economy, the North has embarked on a new course over the last year, seeking diplomatic contacts with the outside world that culminated in the decision to host an inter-Korean summit. During the three-day summit, Kim Dae-jung is expected to appeal to his counterpart to agree to reunions of separated families, a summit sequel in the South Korean capital Seoul and other conciliatory gestures in exchange for economic resources from the South. Though endowed with long-range missile capabilities, North Korea was unable to feed its own people and is now reliant on food aid from its traditional foes: South Korea, Japan and the United States. Reunification, the stated goal of both nations, will be difficult. Sensitive issues to resolve include North Korea's missile and nuclear programs, and the 37,000 US troops deployed in South Korea. Their role has been to deter the North, which is believed to have stockpiles of chemical weapons and one of the world's largest standing armies. Often described as one of the most volatile places on Earth, the Korean peninsula has lived with the threat of another war for more than a generation. In 1994, concerns over the North's purported nuclear weapons programme nearly triggered a military conflict. North Korea is hosting the summit in the mysterious style that it has often employed. It delayed the meeting for a day without a clear explanation, and has refused to announce the schedule, possibly out of concern for the security of Kim Jong Il. The two Kims plan to meet today and on at least one other occasion, and their governments have agreed not to use national flags and anthems to avoid political or ideological frictions. North Korea has barred foreign reporters from attending the summit, allowing only 50 South Korean journalists to join President Kim's entourage. The two countries came tantalisingly close to a summit in 1994, but North Korean leader Kim Il Sung died, aged 82, only weeks before he was due to meet his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young-sam.",

Syria had experienced a series of coups since independence from France in 1946. Assad's in 1970 was the last.</p> <p>However, any comfort Syrians drew from the possibility of a smooth transition was shaken Monday when Rifaat Assad, younger brother of the late president, made his own claim to power.</p> <p>Rifaat, who has been in exile in Europe since attempting to seize power in 1983, told the Associated Press in Beirut through a spokesman that he planned to return to Damascus at the \"appropriate time'' to contest his nephew's leadership.</p>",

US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were among the hundreds of dignitaries to file by the coffin of a man with whom they sometimes clashed, but acknowledged as a powerful shaper of regional politics. The United States listed Syria as a sponsor of terrorism, criticised its human rights record and was frustrated at delays in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks it tried to mediate. But Monday, as Albright prepared to head to Syria for the funeral, she said: \"I think that it's totally appropriate that we pay our respects to a historic figure and that we express our condolences to the people of Syria.'' For ordinary Syrians, the loss of the only president many had ever known sparked a remarkable outpouring of grief that at times seemed staged, at other times almost unbearably heartfelt. They took to the streets of cities and villages, chanting praise for Assad and for Bashar. Young men bared their chests and in a gesture characteristic of Shiite Islam, ripped at their flesh with knives. Women draped in black fainted in the hot, humid weather of recent days. \"You are our leader forever!'' some shouted. \"You see all these people because Assad was a good man,'' said Hosam Chalabi, a 17-year-old student. \"We have to come to say goodbye. It is the one small thing we can do.'' Some Syrians spent the night along the route. Others headed out early in the morning, dressed in black, walking in groups, silent except for the padding of their feet. The wail of Koranic verses from mosque speakers filled the streets. Assad's final resting place was to be Qardaha, the family hometown and burial place of his eldest son and first choice as successor, Basil, who died in a 1994 car crash. The family grave in the town some 200 miles north of Damascus is dominated by a huge marble mausoleum. Assad, known as the Lion of Damascus' - his name means lion in Arabic - rose to power through the ranks of the military and the all-powerful Ba'ath party. Mourners since his death have lauded him for bringing stability. Syria had experienced a series of coups since independence from France in 1946. Assad's in 1970 was the last. However, any comfort Syrians drew from the possibility of a smooth transition was shaken Monday when Rifaat Assad, younger brother of the late president, made his own claim to power. Rifaat, who has been in exile in Europe since attempting to seize power in 1983, told the Associated Press in Beirut through a spokesman that he planned to return to Damascus at the \"appropriate time'' to contest his nephew's leadership.",

      "body": "<p>Already England's participation in Euro 2000 threatens to be brief, if beguiling. Last night Kevin Keegan's team took an early 2-0 lead in the Philips stadium here only to lose 3-2 after Portugal's precise and perceptive attack had exploited some creaky defending. </p> <p>It was the first time that England had lost in such a fashion since going out of the 1970 World Cup to West Germany in Mexico by a similar score. While last night's defeat has not finished their chances in this European Championship, Keegan clearly has a lot of work to do, especially in defence, before Saturday's renewal of hostilities with the Germans. </p> <p>After the Germany-Romania draw in Li\u00e8ge, both sides went into the match with the added incentive of taking an early grip on Group A. For England the prospect of meeting the Germans in Charleroi on Saturday with a win in the bag must have put an extra spring in the step of Kevin Keegan's team. </p> <p>So, in theory, did Keegan's preference of Steve McManaman's aggression over Dennis Wise's guile and patience on the left. If it worked this would not only pose a more direct threat to the Portuguese on that side of the field but might restrict the activities of Luis Figo, who with Rui Costa represented the most obvious danger to England. </p> <p>Then of course there was David Beckham, a player as capable as Luis Figo of turning the match from a flank. The first time Portugal allowed Beckham a generous amount of space on the right, England scored. </p> <p>Before the kick-off Britannia was loudly ruling the waves at the English end of the Philips stadium. And inside three minutes a large breaker had rolled over Portugal's defence. </p> <p>A header from Alan Shearer following Gary Neville's throw-in, which brought Vitor Baia into action after a mere 25 seconds, had dispelled any thought that Keegan's approach might err on the side of caution. That had been just a theory anyway. </p> <p>In England's next attack Phil Neville's searching long centre from the left found its way across the pitch to Beckham and the decision of Dimas to stand off the Manchester United player quickly proved costly for the Portuguese. Beckham's cross, as true as ever, reached the head of Paul Scholes and United, not to mention England, were one up off the underside of the bar. </p> <p>With Portugal ready to match England move for move and shot for shot, an open game quickly developed into an intriguing contest of contrasting attacking styles. If Rui Costa and Luis Figo were pulling the strings for the Portuguese, Beckham's crossbow continued to look potent for England. </p> <p>Sure enough it increased England's lead on 18 minutes. This time Beckham's centre found Scholes cleverly taking two defenders with him towards the near post, leaving McManaman unguarded as he walloped the ball first time into the roof of the net. </p> <p>With their fans singing and Keegan's team swinging, it appeared that England had struck gold. Yet Portugal, too, had by then created a string of chances, with a header from Joao Pinto bouncing over the crossbar, David Seaman keeping out a shot from Rui Costa and Nuno Gomes having a goal ruled out for offside. </p> <p>Then suddenly, in the 22nd minute, Luis Figo let fly from just beyond the penalty arc as Tony Adams lunged towards him and Seaman was simply left standing by the sheer pace of the shot. Clearly England had much to do but so long as Shearer, Scholes and McManaman continued to trouble defenders with their passing and movement, Keegan's players still held the initiative. </p> <p>Not for long, however. England had become strung out by their own attacking enthusiasm and against a team with Portugal's ability to slip into space behind opponents this invited trouble. Paul Ince was having difficulty keeping track of both Rui Costa and Joao Pinto and by half-time another failure to close down a shooting chance had again cost England dear. </p> <p>On 37 minutes, as Rui Costa's centre from the right dipped into the penalty area, Sol Campbell's challenge came a fraction too late to prevent Joao Pinto getting in an angled shot which beat Seaman and rebounded in off the far post. </p> <p>For Keegan the game might have begun like a night at Manchester United but this was more like Newcastle United on one of Kev's more hectic evenings. </p> <p>At half-time Keegan replaced Michael Owen's speed with Emile Heskey's power but that sinking feeling refused to go away as Seaman missed the second of two successive corners from Luis Figo. Joao Pinto wafted the chance over. </p> <p>Obviously England were eager to score again but the discipline and organisation in their own half badly needed to improve if they were to hold Portugal. Whenever Luis Figo and Joao Pinto tucked in behind Nuno Gomes England's square, sweeperless defence looked there for the taking. </p> <p>On the hour it was duly taken yet again.

      "bodyText": "Already England's participation in Euro 2000 threatens to be brief, if beguiling. Last night Kevin Keegan's team took an early 2-0 lead in the Philips stadium here only to lose 3-2 after Portugal's precise and perceptive attack had exploited some creaky defending. It was the first time that England had lost in such a fashion since going out of the 1970 World Cup to West Germany in Mexico by a similar score. While last night's defeat has not finished their chances in this European Championship, Keegan clearly has a lot of work to do, especially in defence, before Saturday's renewal of hostilities with the Germans. After the Germany-Romania draw in Li\u00e8ge, both sides went into the match with the added incentive of taking an early grip on Group A. For England the prospect of meeting the Germans in Charleroi on Saturday with a win in the bag must have put an extra spring in the step of Kevin Keegan's team. So, in theory, did Keegan's preference of Steve McManaman's aggression over Dennis Wise's guile and patience on the left. If it worked this would not only pose a more direct threat to the Portuguese on that side of the field but might restrict the activities of Luis Figo, who with Rui Costa represented the most obvious danger to England. Then of course there was David Beckham, a player as capable as Luis Figo of turning the match from a flank. The first time Portugal allowed Beckham a generous amount of space on the right, England scored. Before the kick-off Britannia was loudly ruling the waves at the English end of the Philips stadium. And inside three minutes a large breaker had rolled over Portugal's defence. A header from Alan Shearer following Gary Neville's throw-in, which brought Vitor Baia into action after a mere 25 seconds, had dispelled any thought that Keegan's approach might err on the side of caution. That had been just a theory anyway. In England's next attack Phil Neville's searching long centre from the left found its way across the pitch to Beckham and the decision of Dimas to stand off the Manchester United player quickly proved costly for the Portuguese. Beckham's cross, as true as ever, reached the head of Paul Scholes and United, not to mention England, were one up off the underside of the bar. With Portugal ready to match England move for move and shot for shot, an open game quickly developed into an intriguing contest of contrasting attacking styles. If Rui Costa and Luis Figo were pulling the strings for the Portuguese, Beckham's crossbow continued to look potent for England. Sure enough it increased England's lead on 18 minutes. This time Beckham's centre found Scholes cleverly taking two defenders with him towards the near post, leaving McManaman unguarded as he walloped the ball first time into the roof of the net. With their fans singing and Keegan's team swinging, it appeared that England had struck gold. Yet Portugal, too, had by then created a string of chances, with a header from Joao Pinto bouncing over the crossbar, David Seaman keeping out a shot from Rui Costa and Nuno Gomes having a goal ruled out for offside. Then suddenly, in the 22nd minute, Luis Figo let fly from just beyond the penalty arc as Tony Adams lunged towards him and Seaman was simply left standing by the sheer pace of the shot. Clearly England had much to do but so long as Shearer, Scholes and McManaman continued to trouble defenders with their passing and movement, Keegan's players still held the initiative. Not for long, however. England had become strung out by their own attacking enthusiasm and against a team with Portugal's ability to slip into space behind opponents this invited trouble. Paul Ince was having difficulty keeping track of both Rui Costa and Joao Pinto and by half-time another failure to close down a shooting chance had again cost England dear. On 37 minutes, as Rui Costa's centre from the right dipped into the penalty area, Sol Campbell's challenge came a fraction too late to prevent Joao Pinto getting in an angled shot which beat Seaman and rebounded in off the far post. For Keegan the game might have begun like a night at Manchester United but this was more like Newcastle United on one of Kev's more hectic evenings. At half-time Keegan replaced Michael Owen's speed with Emile Heskey's power but that sinking feeling refused to go away as Seaman missed the second of two successive corners from Luis Figo. Joao Pinto wafted the chance over. Obviously England were eager to score again but the discipline and organisation in their own half badly needed to improve if they were to hold Portugal. Whenever Luis Figo and Joao Pinto tucked in behind Nuno Gomes England's square, sweeperless defence looked there for the taking. On the hour it was duly taken yet again. McManaman made a brief return after twisting a knee but in the 59th minute he gave way to Wise. Another minute and England were heading for defeat. Using Adams and Campbell as markers, Rui Costa clipped a head-high ball from right to left across the penalty area to Nuno Gomes. Once more Adams stretched to intercept the danger but once more he was just too late and Nuno Gomes beat Seaman emphatically from close range. Thus the flair which had seen England off to a flying start had been undermined by a combination of fragile, ponderous defending and Portugal's technique and vision.

Chaque jour, plus de 30 mille personnes se massent sur les gradins autour des courts de tennis en terre battue o\u00f9 s'affrontent les plus grands joueurs internationaux.</p> <p>Tr\u00e8s pris\u00e9 par les passionn\u00e9s du sport, Roland-Garros est aussi un rendez-vous chic o\u00f9 l'on croise des stars et des hommes politiques . . . on y voit aussi des acteurs tout bronz\u00e9s qui arrivent droit du festival de Cannes.</p> <p>Dommage, cette ann\u00e9e, le beau temps est le grand absent sur la capitale fran\u00e7aise. Mais entre les averses, le spectacle continue. J'ai parl\u00e9 du tournoi \u00e0 une journaliste sportive, Kate Davenport, et deux fans du jeu, Timoth\u00e9e (21 ans) et H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (25 ans).</p> <p><b> Kate Davenport, journaliste sportive: </b> Certains joueurs sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 des num\u00e9ros un mondiaux, mais des joueurs peu connus peuvent aussi se qualifier et il y a parfois des surprises. Par exemple, cette ann\u00e9e, une jeune Espagnole qui s'appelle Marta Marrero s'est qualifi\u00e9e pour les quarts de finale et c'\u00e9tait assez surprenant.</p> <p>Les matches se passent sur de la terre battue. Certains joueurs ne l'aiment pas du tout, par exemple Pete Sampras, l'Am\u00e9ricain qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 num\u00e9ro un pendant six ans. Il a fait tous les titres mais il n'a jamais gagn\u00e9 Roland-Garros. Cette ann\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 au premier tour.</p> <p>L'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, il faisait tr\u00e8s beau. Cette ann\u00e9e c'est un peu moins rigolo parce que le temps est mauvais. C'est stressant pour les joueurs aussi : quand tu es en train de gagner un match et qu'il faut t'arr\u00eater pendant deux heures, puis revenir, c'est difficile de maintenir la tension psychologique.</p> <p>\u00c0 part \u00e7a je trouve aga\u00e7ante l'attitude des photographes qui s'emballent sur les jolies joueuses en petites jupettes. Les attitudes sexistes qui circulent sont assez choquantes.</p> <p><b> Que penses-tu du tournoi ? </b></p> <p><b>Timoth\u00e9e: </b> J'y suis all\u00e9 une fois, l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re. C'\u00e9tait assez festif. C'est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ce Roland Garros, c'est particulier. Le tournoi est assez mondain. \u00c7a fait bien de dire qu'on est all\u00e9 \u00e0 Roland-Garros et bien s\u00fbr, c'est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement hyper m\u00e9diatique. En m\u00eame temps, les gens y vont pour l'amour du jeu. Cette ann\u00e9e, je m'y suis pris trop tard pour avoir des places, c'est dommage.</p> <p><b> H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: </b> J'y suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 all\u00e9e plein de fois. J'ai vu tellement de matches que c'est difficile de savoir lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 le plus spectaculaire.</p> <p><b> Quelle est l'ambiance pendant le tournoi? </b></p> <p><b>Timoth\u00e9e: </b> Tout le monde est compl\u00e8tement sous l'emprise du jeu, tout le monde est passionn\u00e9. C'est tr\u00e8s difficile d'avoir des places donc quand on en a, on est super content.</p> <p><b> H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: </b> C'est g\u00e9nial, il y a une sorte d'euphorie dans l'air. Et quand ton joueur pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 gagne, t'es trop content. M\u00eame quand on regarde les matches \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9, ils peuvent susciter des vraies \u00e9motions.</p> <p><b> Quel est l'importance du tennis en France? </b></p> <p><b>Timoth\u00e9e: </b> Je le vois comme un sport chic, beaucoup moins populaire que le football ou le rugby, par exemple. Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais ce sport est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 une certaine classe sociale.</p> <p><b> H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: </b> D\u00e8s que Roland-Garros arrive, le go\u00fbt pour le tennis revient chez les Fran\u00e7ais. Et pendant le tournoi, d\u00e8s qu'il y a un match de tennis tr\u00e8s important, on n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 d\u00e9caler une \u00e9mission \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9 pour pouvoir suivre le match, sp\u00e9cialement quand il y a un Fran\u00e7ais qui joue.</p> <p><b> Y-a-t-il un mauvais c\u00f4t\u00e9 du tournoi?</b></p> <p><b>Timoth\u00e9e: </b> Le c\u00f4t\u00e9 m\u00e9diatique de Roland-Garros prend de plus en plus d'ampleur tous les ans. On exploite la figure des joueurs pour des campagnes publicitaires et la manipulation dont sont victimes les joueurs est un peu \u00e9coeurante.</p> <p><b> H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: </b> Le pire c'est la pluie. Surtout quand elle ne s'arr\u00eate pas comme cette ann\u00e9e. C'est l'enfer pour les amateurs de tennis - t'ach\u00e8tes ton billet et quand il pleut, les matches sont annul\u00e9s, et ils ne reprennent que quand la pluie s'arr\u00eate. Tout le monde y perd et franchement, il n'y a rien de plus triste que Roland-Garros sous la flotte.</p> <p><b> Et toi, tu joues au tennis?</b></p> <p><b>Timoth\u00e9e: </b> J'adore \u00e7a, je joue tous les week-ends. Mais c'est s\u00fbr qu'il faut conna\u00eetre les bons filons pour jouer dans Paris parce que \u00e9videmment, on ne peut pas y jouer n'importe o\u00f9. \u00c7a me d\u00e9foule, j'aime taper pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans la balle.

      "bodyText": "C'est Roland-Garros, la grande rencontre des tennis men\u00e9e Paris. Chaque jour, plus de 30 mille personnes se massent sur les gradins autour des courts de tennis en terre battue o\u00f9 s'affrontent les plus grands joueurs internationaux. Tr\u00e8s pris\u00e9 par les passionn\u00e9s du sport, Roland-Garros est aussi un rendez-vous chic o\u00f9 l'on croise des stars et des hommes politiques . . . on y voit aussi des acteurs tout bronz\u00e9s qui arrivent droit du festival de Cannes. Dommage, cette ann\u00e9e, le beau temps est le grand absent sur la capitale fran\u00e7aise. Mais entre les averses, le spectacle continue. J'ai parl\u00e9 du tournoi \u00e0 une journaliste sportive, Kate Davenport, et deux fans du jeu, Timoth\u00e9e (21 ans) et H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (25 ans). Kate Davenport, journaliste sportive: Certains joueurs sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 des num\u00e9ros un mondiaux, mais des joueurs peu connus peuvent aussi se qualifier et il y a parfois des surprises. Par exemple, cette ann\u00e9e, une jeune Espagnole qui s'appelle Marta Marrero s'est qualifi\u00e9e pour les quarts de finale et c'\u00e9tait assez surprenant. Les matches se passent sur de la terre battue. Certains joueurs ne l'aiment pas du tout, par exemple Pete Sampras, l'Am\u00e9ricain qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 num\u00e9ro un pendant six ans. Il a fait tous les titres mais il n'a jamais gagn\u00e9 Roland-Garros. Cette ann\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 au premier tour. L'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, il faisait tr\u00e8s beau. Cette ann\u00e9e c'est un peu moins rigolo parce que le temps est mauvais. C'est stressant pour les joueurs aussi : quand tu es en train de gagner un match et qu'il faut t'arr\u00eater pendant deux heures, puis revenir, c'est difficile de maintenir la tension psychologique. \u00c0 part \u00e7a je trouve aga\u00e7ante l'attitude des photographes qui s'emballent sur les jolies joueuses en petites jupettes. Les attitudes sexistes qui circulent sont assez choquantes. Que penses-tu du tournoi ? Timoth\u00e9e: J'y suis all\u00e9 une fois, l'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re. C'\u00e9tait assez festif. C'est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ce Roland Garros, c'est particulier. Le tournoi est assez mondain. \u00c7a fait bien de dire qu'on est all\u00e9 \u00e0 Roland-Garros et bien s\u00fbr, c'est un \u00e9v\u00e9nement hyper m\u00e9diatique. En m\u00eame temps, les gens y vont pour l'amour du jeu. Cette ann\u00e9e, je m'y suis pris trop tard pour avoir des places, c'est dommage. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: J'y suis d\u00e9j\u00e0 all\u00e9e plein de fois. J'ai vu tellement de matches que c'est difficile de savoir lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 le plus spectaculaire. Quelle est l'ambiance pendant le tournoi? Timoth\u00e9e: Tout le monde est compl\u00e8tement sous l'emprise du jeu, tout le monde est passionn\u00e9. C'est tr\u00e8s difficile d'avoir des places donc quand on en a, on est super content. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: C'est g\u00e9nial, il y a une sorte d'euphorie dans l'air. Et quand ton joueur pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 gagne, t'es trop content. M\u00eame quand on regarde les matches \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9, ils peuvent susciter des vraies \u00e9motions. Quel est l'importance du tennis en France? Timoth\u00e9e: Je le vois comme un sport chic, beaucoup moins populaire que le football ou le rugby, par exemple. Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais ce sport est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 une certaine classe sociale. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: D\u00e8s que Roland-Garros arrive, le go\u00fbt pour le tennis revient chez les Fran\u00e7ais. Et pendant le tournoi, d\u00e8s qu'il y a un match de tennis tr\u00e8s important, on n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 d\u00e9caler une \u00e9mission \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9 pour pouvoir suivre le match, sp\u00e9cialement quand il y a un Fran\u00e7ais qui joue. Y-a-t-il un mauvais c\u00f4t\u00e9 du tournoi? Timoth\u00e9e: Le c\u00f4t\u00e9 m\u00e9diatique de Roland-Garros prend de plus en plus d'ampleur tous les ans. On exploite la figure des joueurs pour des campagnes publicitaires et la manipulation dont sont victimes les joueurs est un peu \u00e9coeurante. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: Le pire c'est la pluie. Surtout quand elle ne s'arr\u00eate pas comme cette ann\u00e9e. C'est l'enfer pour les amateurs de tennis - t'ach\u00e8tes ton billet et quand il pleut, les matches sont annul\u00e9s, et ils ne reprennent que quand la pluie s'arr\u00eate. Tout le monde y perd et franchement, il n'y a rien de plus triste que Roland-Garros sous la flotte. Et toi, tu joues au tennis? Timoth\u00e9e: J'adore \u00e7a, je joue tous les week-ends. Mais c'est s\u00fbr qu'il faut conna\u00eetre les bons filons pour jouer dans Paris parce que \u00e9videmment, on ne peut pas y jouer n'importe o\u00f9. \u00c7a me d\u00e9foule, j'aime taper pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans la balle. C'est un sport de concentration, un peu comme les \u00e9checs : il faut bien viser, avoir le terrain bien en t\u00eate . . . c'est toute une tactique. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne: J'en ai vachement fait - m\u00eame de la compet mais j'ai eu plein de probl\u00e8mes aux genoux et j'ai d arr\u00eater. En plus, j'en ai tellement fait \u00e0 une \u00e9poque que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu d\u00e9got\u00e9e du sport. J'adore quand m\u00eame jouer, mais maintenant c'est que du loisir. Glossaire/Glossary il faut conna\u00eetre les bons filons (coll.) you have to be in the know une compet (coll.) a competition se d\u00e9fouler to let off steam \u00eatre \u00e9coeurant to be sickening \u00eatre rigolo (coll.) to be funny une figure face, personality la flotte (coll.) rain, water un gradin a terrace, tier hyper (coll.) really une t\u00e9l\u00e9 (coll.) telly court en terre battue a clay court",

It's amazing what happens when you breathe.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>EUROTALK</strong></p> <p>\"You go 2-0 ahead and you've got to fancy your chances of winning.\" Kevin Keegan. Oh well.</p> <p> <strong>THE EURO-TORIAL</strong></p> <p>It's over. If you listen to any of the voices calling for Kevin Keegan's head (a mere 24 hours after kissing it), England's 3-2 defeat by Portugal is a disgrace and the team should be forced to fly home before the end of the day. The coach has been castigated, the playing staff slated and even Des Lynam's banter has been criticised. Why this should happen after England's best performance for some time is a bit of a puzzler.</p> <p>Sure, David Seaman was flapping like a tent door in the wind, Tony Adams showed his age, Paul Ince was missing, and Phil Neville was, well, Phil Neville. But England's performance last night was better than any other under Kevin Keegan and, with a few honourable exceptions, better than any under Glenn Hoddle, too. For the majority of the first half England passed the ball well, were compact in defence and incisive in attack. In the second half they started the better team too, only to fade badly after conceding the third goal.</p> <p>If anything England exceeded their own expectations and, at two goals up, allowed their concentration to slip. One minute Paul Scholes was teasing three Portuguese midfielders, the next Figo had cracked in his 30-yarder. Echoes of Newcastle perhaps. But neither Germany nor Romania have the players to take advantage of this exuberance in the way that Portugal did, and if England can summon up two similar performances, starting in Charleroi on Saturday, they will qualify for the quarter-finals.

It's amazing what happens when you breathe. * * * * * * * * * * * * * EUROTALK \"You go 2-0 ahead and you've got to fancy your chances of winning.\" Kevin Keegan. Oh well. THE EURO-TORIAL It's over. If you listen to any of the voices calling for Kevin Keegan's head (a mere 24 hours after kissing it), England's 3-2 defeat by Portugal is a disgrace and the team should be forced to fly home before the end of the day. The coach has been castigated, the playing staff slated and even Des Lynam's banter has been criticised. Why this should happen after England's best performance for some time is a bit of a puzzler. Sure, David Seaman was flapping like a tent door in the wind, Tony Adams showed his age, Paul Ince was missing, and Phil Neville was, well, Phil Neville. But England's performance last night was better than any other under Kevin Keegan and, with a few honourable exceptions, better than any under Glenn Hoddle, too. For the majority of the first half England passed the ball well, were compact in defence and incisive in attack. In the second half they started the better team too, only to fade badly after conceding the third goal. If anything England exceeded their own expectations and, at two goals up, allowed their concentration to slip. One minute Paul Scholes was teasing three Portuguese midfielders, the next Figo had cracked in his 30-yarder. Echoes of Newcastle perhaps. But neither Germany nor Romania have the players to take advantage of this exuberance in the way that Portugal did, and if England can summon up two similar performances, starting in Charleroi on Saturday, they will qualify for the quarter-finals. Not that we're about to put any money on it. * * * * * * * * * * * * * A HIGHLY AVERAGE PERFORMANCE The tabloids' player ratings averaged out and presented in a pleasing easy to read format. Seaman 6 \"Looked ill at ease\" (Mail) G. Neville 5.8 \"Became bemused by the Portuguese\" (Sun) S. Campbell 5.8 \"Pick of the defenders\" ? (Express) Adams 5.6 \"Found the Portuguese knew a bit too much about attack.\" (Star) P. Neville 5.6 \"With Figo in his face he struggled.\" (Star) Beckham 8 \"It will be a tragedy for him if England don't get through.\" (Sun) Ince 6 \"Was given the runaround\" - (Mail) Scholes 7.2 \"Ghosted past defences and caused confusion\" (Mirror) MacManaman 6.8 \"So lively and really up for it.\" (Star) Shearer 5.8 \"Took a battering but held firm\" (Mirror) Owen 6 \"No surprise he was substituted\" (Express) Subs Heskey 6 \"Shadow of the player who thrilled against Argentina\" (Mail) Wise 6 \"Struggled to create\" (Mirror) Keown 5.33 WHAT THE PAPERS SAID... \"OUTplayed, OUTclassed, OUTthought, OUT?\" Daily Mirror \"The madness of King Kevin descended on England last night. Put in terms of military history, England went from the battle of Waterloo to the Charge of the Light Brigade in the space of 90 tumultuous minutes.\" Jeff Powell, Daily Mail \"They didn't concede victory in Holland last night - they threw it away through their own scandalous naivety and dereliction of basic duty.\" John Sadler, The Sun \"What is the international equivalent of surrendering a 12-point lead? Losing when two goals up after 18 minutes, perhaps. Yet rather this, surely, than a stale 1-0 defeat or one of those stupefying games of chess.\" Martin Samuel, Daily Express \"This 3-2 defeat was as withering as any in recent memory. Seldom have a team lurched from such early promise to such abject disappointment.\" Paul Hayward, Daily Telegraph \"Portugal call their senior players the 'golden generation'. Shearer and Seaman are more liked scratched brass.\" Oliver Holt, The Times * * * * * * * * * * * * * A MESSAGE FROM BREATHE.COM You'll get a wider view of Euro 2000 at www.breathe.com.

The computers also enable players to supply the site with their own match reports, columns and previews - categories include \"duels &amp; feuds\" and \"crocs corner\". </p> <p>Simon Ecclestone, the former Somerset captain who is now the PCA's communications manager, says: \"Our aim was to find one potential journalist in each dressing-room.

David Graveney, the PCA's chief executive, explains: \"The rank-and-file player doesn't often have a chance to get his views across in public. So you may see views from the dressing-room appearing on our site. It's an extra dimension for the fan. But don't expect to find issues such as, say, the possibility of strike action being discussed.\"</p> <p>Graveney says the new equipment is also intended to improve internal communication with the PCA's representatives at each club, as well as allowing all players to keep up with the latest cricket news from around the world.

Lara is only being paid a total of \u00a325,000 for his newspaper column in The Mail on Sunday, compared with the \u00a340,000 the Daily Mail shelled out for his services during his marvellous season with Warwickshire in 1994. Then, Lara could dictate terms off the field as well as on it: he had just scored his Test record 375 against England. </p> <p>Lara's Mail fee this time round actually represents a cut of nearly 50 per cent on that of six years ago - allowing for inflation, the \u00a340,000 would now be about \u00a347,000. The reduction is partly explained by the fact that Lara's thoughts will not appear every week. \"He'll be a featured guest columnist most weeks, tying in with the Tests and one-day series,\" says a Mail on Sunday insider. Another consideration is Lara's poor time-keeping and unreliability, which at times made life difficult for the Mail sports team.</p> <p>However the Mail on Sunday is concerned, most of all, that the fragile superstar may not complete the three-month tour. The paper's caution was justified soon enough: within days of signing for them early last month, Lara made himself unavailable for the Windies tour, then changed his mind 24 hours later.</p> <p>For Lara, the column has already become a platform from which to reply to his critics. In his first piece, on June 4, he took the chance to describe as \"untrue\" reports that during those 24 hours he had held the West Indies Board to ransom over his availability - or asked for more money than his fellow tourists.</p> <p><em>Charles de Lisle is the author, with Christopher Martin-Jenkins, of An Australian Summer: The Story of the 1998/9 Ashes Series (Faber).

Then, Lara could dictate terms off the field as well as on it: he had just scored his Test record 375 against England. Lara's Mail fee this time round actually represents a cut of nearly 50 per cent on that of six years ago - allowing for inflation, the \u00a340,000 would now be about \u00a347,000. The reduction is partly explained by the fact that Lara's thoughts will not appear every week. \"He'll be a featured guest columnist most weeks, tying in with the Tests and one-day series,\" says a Mail on Sunday insider. Another consideration is Lara's poor time-keeping and unreliability, which at times made life difficult for the Mail sports team. However the Mail on Sunday is concerned, most of all, that the fragile superstar may not complete the three-month tour. The paper's caution was justified soon enough: within days of signing for them early last month, Lara made himself unavailable for the Windies tour, then changed his mind 24 hours later. For Lara, the column has already become a platform from which to reply to his critics. In his first piece, on June 4, he took the chance to describe as \"untrue\" reports that during those 24 hours he had held the West Indies Board to ransom over his availability - or asked for more money than his fellow tourists.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair observed to colleagues yesterday that the chancellor of the exchequer must not be humiliated. It was an important but perhaps an academic remark. Gordon Brown has variously let it be known that he will not be \"bounced\", or \"pressured\", or \"driven off course\", away from his determination not to admit the euro-sterling issue as a subject fit for political debate. His briefers having staked out that ground, Mr Brown, in the prime minister's view, has to be protected. So no more ministerial talk about the euro for a while. The strategy of silence, however, is rapidly being removed from politicians' control. Among other things, it touches exactly the public nerve that has sent Labour's poll lead plummeting into single figures.</p> <p>The cabinet is pictured as divided over the euro. This is not the case. There aren't two camps of opposed convictions. This is not a re-run of Labour cabinets in the 1960s and 70s, in permanent battle over Europe. The divide is entirely about tactics, and not well formulated at that. If and when, after getting a second term, Mr Blair presses the button, there will not be a single cabinet dissenter.</p> <p>Mr Brown's tactical attitude is not baseless. He wants to keep quiet now because he doesn't want his hands tied, but also because he wants the largest possible electoral majority. That's what Philip Gould is telling the party high command: saliency for the euro risks raising the Tory vote to 35%, and lowering the Labour majority. Even pro-euro Euros, who want a referendum and want it won, must hear that. The Brown case, shared by Blair, that the ideal time to confront the euro issue is after a big election victory, addresses seriously this most crucial of calculations.</p> <p>But the strategy was born in a different era. In October 1997, when it was formed, and for two years after, the government thought it would have total control over the election agenda. It was easy to write decrees about what would and would not be debated. In June 2000, such assurance does not sing, and in May 2001 is likely to look even more remote from the facts. We're witnessing not a contest between cabinet factions, but events that are becoming bigger than both of them.</p> <p>For one thing, everyone else is talking about the euro. The Brown blanket covers only a fraction of the public world. The very argument, about whether ministers should or should not discuss it, brings it to the centre of attention. This will carry on indefinitely. The imposition of silence intensifies the chatter, assisted by developments that cannot be stifled. Not one of the last 10 days has passed without a big intervention on the subject, whether from the OECD or Kenneth Clarke or the Treasury or, yesterday, an impressive, heavyweight statement of the pro-euro case from Britain in Europe, itself a body on which Blair and Brown imposed an earlier version of their non-intervention strategy.</p> <p>The BiE evolution is an object lesson in the futility of this line. Euro-talk is seeping out all over. Every time a Japanese investor talks about withdrawal from the UK, it comes out further. This is certainly inconvenient. It upsets the measured approach Mr Blair laid down, forestalls the lengthy preparation he would prefer. But there it is. Uncontrollable, unstoppable, crackling the static every day, now beyond the reach of any chancellor to gag. That's the first reason why the tactical argument has a new context.</p> <p>But there's a second, arising out of the calamity at the Women's Institute, which drove Philip Gould to put words round Mr Blair's dilemma: his crisis of credibility, his perceived lack of conviction, the sense he conveys of being all spin and presentation, the belief this engenders that he cannot hold to a position he believes in. None of these, I believe, are well justified perceptions. And Mr Gould was talking about issues that matter more than Europe to the voter: crime especially, asylum partly, the public services over all. Yet these depictions apply with some precision to the Blair-Brown strategy for Europe.</p> <p>We know, after all, that they are both believers. Mr Blair categorically, and Mr Brown more contingently, are focused on getting into the euro. They have that clear idea, and they long ago rejected every political or constitutional argument against it. Yet they will not now say so. They favour a studied evasiveness, make a virtue out of non-debate. Is this not the very trait that Mr Gould put his finger on, in the memo leaked on Sunday? Could there be a plainer example of slippery politics, obsessed with presentation, than this concealment pro tem of a conviction which the leadership is in truth developing more strongly week by week?</p> <p>The Gould answer to that would be to cite another part of his analysis, which said that Mr Blair was out of touch with ordinary people. Since ordinary people don't like the euro, the last way the prime minister could hope to remake his credentials as a man of the people is by going on about Europe. And, as far as empathy goes, that may be true. On the other hand, the costs of continuing evasion, making a ponderous virtue out of systematic silence, will soon not be sustainable.</p> <p>The reason, ultimately, is rooted in truth. Because the euro has become part of the daily static, everyone knows it is the real issue, transcending all else to do with Europe. For ministers to be the only people not to talk about it will come to seem so perverse that the only intelligible explanation is cowardice, or deep, palpable, brazen cunning. Mr Brown plans to re-establish his strategy at the Mansion House on Thursday. Even if he rises to the height of his formidable grandeur to come crashing down on the euro-speculators among the pygmies who surround him in the cabinet, the mismatch between tactic and reality will remain. Unless it is reconsidered, much of the Gould critique will hang unrebutted in the air.</p> <p>To change the line, making it more honest, would be painful. It would also give the Tories material to raise their game. However, that game is already going on. There's a lot of cheating with the facts, malign fantasies about the Labour programme, profound dishonesty as to the meaning of their own position. Attacking the breezy fecklessness with which William Hague would carry Britain to the irrelevant edge of the EU, prior to eventual dribbling departure, will be Labour's prime way of engaging.</p> <p>But it is not enough. To recapture its name for clarity and conviction, sweeping away the fog of spin in which it has obscured itself, the government has nothing more urgent to talk about than the merits of the single currency. At present it is hooked to a policy which it denies itself the opportunity to defend. It fights with only half a heart, the silent spectator at other people's arguments. A cabinet of belief, not daring to say so. A spectacle to make one ask what happened since May 1997.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

There aren't two camps of opposed convictions. This is not a re-run of Labour cabinets in the 1960s and 70s, in permanent battle over Europe. The divide is entirely about tactics, and not well formulated at that. If and when, after getting a second term, Mr Blair presses the button, there will not be a single cabinet dissenter. Mr Brown's tactical attitude is not baseless. He wants to keep quiet now because he doesn't want his hands tied, but also because he wants the largest possible electoral majority. That's what Philip Gould is telling the party high command: saliency for the euro risks raising the Tory vote to 35%, and lowering the Labour majority. Even pro-euro Euros, who want a referendum and want it won, must hear that. The Brown case, shared by Blair, that the ideal time to confront the euro issue is after a big election victory, addresses seriously this most crucial of calculations. But the strategy was born in a different era. In October 1997, when it was formed, and for two years after, the government thought it would have total control over the election agenda. It was easy to write decrees about what would and would not be debated. In June 2000, such assurance does not sing, and in May 2001 is likely to look even more remote from the facts. We're witnessing not a contest between cabinet factions, but events that are becoming bigger than both of them. For one thing, everyone else is talking about the euro. The Brown blanket covers only a fraction of the public world. The very argument, about whether ministers should or should not discuss it, brings it to the centre of attention. This will carry on indefinitely. The imposition of silence intensifies the chatter, assisted by developments that cannot be stifled. Not one of the last 10 days has passed without a big intervention on the subject, whether from the OECD or Kenneth Clarke or the Treasury or, yesterday, an impressive, heavyweight statement of the pro-euro case from Britain in Europe, itself a body on which Blair and Brown imposed an earlier version of their non-intervention strategy. The BiE evolution is an object lesson in the futility of this line. Euro-talk is seeping out all over. Every time a Japanese investor talks about withdrawal from the UK, it comes out further. This is certainly inconvenient. It upsets the measured approach Mr Blair laid down, forestalls the lengthy preparation he would prefer. But there it is. Uncontrollable, unstoppable, crackling the static every day, now beyond the reach of any chancellor to gag. That's the first reason why the tactical argument has a new context. But there's a second, arising out of the calamity at the Women's Institute, which drove Philip Gould to put words round Mr Blair's dilemma: his crisis of credibility, his perceived lack of conviction, the sense he conveys of being all spin and presentation, the belief this engenders that he cannot hold to a position he believes in. None of these, I believe, are well justified perceptions. And Mr Gould was talking about issues that matter more than Europe to the voter: crime especially, asylum partly, the public services over all. Yet these depictions apply with some precision to the Blair-Brown strategy for Europe. We know, after all, that they are both believers. Mr Blair categorically, and Mr Brown more contingently, are focused on getting into the euro. They have that clear idea, and they long ago rejected every political or constitutional argument against it. Yet they will not now say so. They favour a studied evasiveness, make a virtue out of non-debate. Is this not the very trait that Mr Gould put his finger on, in the memo leaked on Sunday? Could there be a plainer example of slippery politics, obsessed with presentation, than this concealment pro tem of a conviction which the leadership is in truth developing more strongly week by week? The Gould answer to that would be to cite another part of his analysis, which said that Mr Blair was out of touch with ordinary people. Since ordinary people don't like the euro, the last way the prime minister could hope to remake his credentials as a man of the people is by going on about Europe. And, as far as empathy goes, that may be true. On the other hand, the costs of continuing evasion, making a ponderous virtue out of systematic silence, will soon not be sustainable. The reason, ultimately, is rooted in truth. Because the euro has become part of the daily static, everyone knows it is the real issue, transcending all else to do with Europe. For ministers to be the only people not to talk about it will come to seem so perverse that the only intelligible explanation is cowardice, or deep, palpable, brazen cunning. Mr Brown plans to re-establish his strategy at the Mansion House on Thursday. Even if he rises to the height of his formidable grandeur to come crashing down on the euro-speculators among the pygmies who surround him in the cabinet, the mismatch between tactic and reality will remain. Unless it is reconsidered, much of the Gould critique will hang unrebutted in the air. To change the line, making it more honest, would be painful. It would also give the Tories material to raise their game. However, that game is already going on. There's a lot of cheating with the facts, malign fantasies about the Labour programme, profound dishonesty as to the meaning of their own position. Attacking the breezy fecklessness with which William Hague would carry Britain to the irrelevant edge of the EU, prior to eventual dribbling departure, will be Labour's prime way of engaging. But it is not enough. To recapture its name for clarity and conviction, sweeping away the fog of spin in which it has obscured itself, the government has nothing more urgent to talk about than the merits of the single currency. At present it is hooked to a policy which it denies itself the opportunity to defend. It fights with only half a heart, the silent spectator at other people's arguments. A cabinet of belief, not daring to say so. A spectacle to make one ask what happened since May 1997. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

Westminster city council said it had received resignation letters from eight of the 40 teaching staff at St George's Roman Catholic school in Maida Vale, north-west London, who will leave at the end of this term. Earlier this year education chiefs declared the school \"out of control\" and under threat of closure after a breakdown of discipline under the headteacher, Margaret Ryan, who decided to take early retirement. Police were called in to break up a fight, and pupils were reported to fight regularly in the classrooms, corridors and the playground. The head was blamed for retaining troublesome pupils, although her supporters said government targets to reduce exclusions did not help. A private sector hitsquad headed by Nord Anglia was sent in to restore discipline, and a new head teacher, Marie Stubbs, was hired. But some staff have complained privately about the difficult working conditions and the personal style of Lady Stubbs, wife of Sir William Stubbs, chairman of the government's qualifications and curriculum authority.

I am often told the media should \"celebrate\" the successes of schools. </p> <p>Yet try applying this to other areas: do teachers expect the media to \"celebrate\" the successes of the government rather than focus on the problems it has yet to resolve? Should the news report that several thousand hospital operations have been completed successfully or should it highlight those that have gone wrong because of neglect, incompetence or under-funding? </p> <p>But there is a simpler reason why education gets the media coverage it deserves: many educators make little effort to influence the news agenda and have abandoned the public debate to the politicians and polemicists. </p> <p>Many people working in education wish it had a better image but do not feel it is their responsibility, or within their capability, to change it. Yet the media needs the input of experts and practitioners if it is to contribute sensibly to the public debate. </p> <p>Sadly, it has become increasingly difficult for the media to gain access to schools and universities, especially since market forces have put them in competition with one another. </p> <p>Yet when they take the plunge, it often works to their advantage. Take Gordon Brown's recent attack on the \"elitism\" of Oxford University for rejecting comprehensive school pupil Laura Spence. Stung by the Chancellor's attack, Magdalen College came out fighting and gave me and my film crew full access to tutors and students. The result was a report that showed a selection process that is painstakingly careful to avoid discriminating against comprehensive school pupils. Oxford students from state schools eagerly approached us wanting to correct the impression given by Gordon Brown. </p> <p>Magdalen also broke with precedent and released details of the applications and acceptances for medicine, the course that rejected Laura Spence. Only one in four applicants were from comprehensive schools, yet of the five accepted, two were from comprehensives, three were women and three were from ethnic minorities. Gordon Brown's elitism charge collapsed. </p> <p>It was the same with William Hague's speech on school discipline. He had hoped to do for \"young thugs\" what he had done for asylum seekers, arguing that the \"liberal elite\" were putting the interests of the minority of disruptive pupils ahead of the well-behaved majority. He cited a specific example: the Zaccheus Centre in Birmingham, which he offered as a model for his proposed off-site \"progress centres\" to replace the government's \"gimmick\" of on-site learning support units. </p> <p>But a visit to the Zaccheus Centre revealed a more complex reality. It soon emerged that despite being held up as a model by Hague, it was actually funded by the Labour government. Moreover, its director believed different types of provision were needed for different pupils and rejected the Tory leader's idea of scrapping learning support units. </p> <p>In both these cases, openness enabled journalists to give a clearer picture than the one presented by political rhetoric. In general, the public will trust schools and colleges ahead of most politicians but only if those institutions are not secretive. </p> <p>When schools are attacked, it is usually in their interests to be open. The Ridings School in Halifax, Yorkshire, received awful coverage while it kept the media outside. Once the new acting head, Peter Clark, was in place he invited the media in. It helped to show the public the progress being made and the difficulties the staff faced. </p> <p>There are some courageous headteachers and teachers who, for the good of their profession, invite the media into their school to help air important issues. Without the grass-roots evidence they provide, the public debate on education policy would be much poorer. </p> <p>University education departments could also do more. In science, academics have tried to bridge the gap between themselves and the public with a scheme for scientists to shadow people in the media and a university chair for the public understanding of science. </p> <p>Which university will take the bold step of appointing a professor for the public understanding of education? </p> <p>Language is also terribly important. In the 1970s, as media coverage of schools became highly critical, even hostile, the education profession went on the defensive. It drew its wagons into a circle and ignored the public debate. As educators increasingly spoke only to one another, a new \"education-speak\" developed. </p> <p>This protective jargon talks of \"best practice\" as if it is some self-evident truth needing no further explanation. It prefers \"learning environments\" to \"classrooms\", \"diagnostic assessments\" to tests. </p> <p>The failure of teachers to speak in a language that parents understood led to them losing the public argument. One reason why Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, is so successful in attracting media attention is the directness of his language. </p> <p>There is also a need to counter the government's domination of the news agenda. Many things happen in schools that merit media attention. Unfortunately, many such stories are never reported because those involved do not think it is important. </p> <p>It is also difficult to get access to schools on controversial issues such as funding shortages, teacher recruitment or discipline. </p> <p>The independent school sector deals with media inquiries much more confidently. This may be because they have the professional services of their own press and information team, the Independent Schools Information Service. Few local education authority press offices can match them. Perhaps it is time state schools banded together to create a state schools information service. It could recommend schools to journalists, promote school-based initiatives, and help schools in trouble to deal with the media. </p> <p>A membership fee spread between 25,000 schools need not be burdensome. Indeed, it would prove much cheaper than the costs some schools already pay for individual PR advice. </p> <p>We are emerging from a period of intense policy change. Inevitably the government has dominated the agenda. But as the flow of Whitehall initiatives slows down, there will be more space for others to set the agenda. Now is the time for the teaching profession to regain its voice in the public debate via the media.</p> <p>\u0095 Mike Baker is the BBC's education correspondent.

Few local education authority press offices can match them. Perhaps it is time state schools banded together to create a state schools information service. It could recommend schools to journalists, promote school-based initiatives, and help schools in trouble to deal with the media. A membership fee spread between 25,000 schools need not be burdensome. Indeed, it would prove much cheaper than the costs some schools already pay for individual PR advice. We are emerging from a period of intense policy change. Inevitably the government has dominated the agenda. But as the flow of Whitehall initiatives slows down, there will be more space for others to set the agenda. Now is the time for the teaching profession to regain its voice in the public debate via the media. \u0095 Mike Baker is the BBC's education correspondent. This is a shortened version of his inaugural lecture as visiting professor at the Institute of Education at 6pm tomorrow. The full version is available from their bookshop (tel: 020-7612 6050).",

Ellie Baker, a sixth-form student at South Wiltshire Grammar School, was forecast a respectable but unremarkable C grade in her design and technology A level earlier in the course.

The Jubilee Sailing Trust helps to ensure that there are no barriers on the grounds of disability. The trust's second ship, the 65m Tenacious, will be making her maiden voyage in September. </p> <p>And this is where Ellie's invention plays its part. She explains: \"I was at the boat show - I love sailing - and I had just lost the sailing-linked project I thought I was going to work on. My boyfriend's brother stopped me at the sailing trust stand, and told them I wanted a project. They put me in touch with Captain John Fisher [senior master of the trust] and he gave me the task of designing the rubber angle indicator for visually impaired and wheelchair-bound people.\" The aim is that by using the indicator in conjunction with the talking compass, which is already used beside the ship's wheel, the person steering will have greater independence and be able to ascertain in which direction they are heading. </p> <p>Ellie's design allows the helmsperson to find out the angle of the rudder by a system of cables and sprung pins that are lifted to indicate the line of direction. Richard Walker, the trust's chief engineer, says he is extremely impressed with the quality and detail of Ellie's project. Whilst it is too late to be fitted to the Tenacious for her maiden voyage, he believes that with some modification, the invention will be on both Tenacious and the Lord Nelson very soon. </p> <p>Steve Ungi, Ellie's teacher, is equally impressed.

He is familiar with the talking compass, but he says that if Ellie's device is as good as it sounds, he's looking forward to helming the ship in and out of port - something that is impossible at the moment. </p> <p>Richard Dyson, inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner, has said that in inventing, \"99.99% of what you do is a failure\".

No one knows in the UK,\" says Wood. </p> <p>She has worked as a fabric designer since leaving the Royal College of Art five years ago. She first encountered hemp as a fabric in 1997, while working as a textile designer for an American firm in Hong Kong. </p> <p>\"I happened to visit a Chinese factory and saw them making hemp fabrics for jeans and T-shirts.

Now we have to relearn all those skills,\" explains Wood. </p> <p>With such obvious enthusiasm it's easy to see why The Queen Elizabeth Trust, which specialises in helping people develop craft skills which will contribute to the UK pool of talent, was so taken with Wood's application.

      "body": "<p>\"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me\" </p> <p>Anyone who remembers being bullied and teased as a child will recognise this rhyme as wishful fiction. But what happens when the verbal abuse is not just a throwaway taunt, or even an exchange of insults, but the modern equivalent of what Enid Blyton called \"poison-pen\" letters? </p> <p>Thanks to the ubiquity of email and - for mobile phone owners - text-messaging, children who may object loudly to the notion of writing a letter on paper will happily send messages by email. It helps children to practise putting their thoughts and feelings into words, and the results should show up in the literacy hour and English lessons. It's also inevitable that they will sometimes get it wrong, and the injuries sustained by an email usually take much longer to heal than verbal wounds. </p> <p>Professor Helen Petrie of the University of Hertfordshire says most adults haven't yet learnt how to use email - so it's hardly surprising that children, who don't have a full grasp of linguistic nuances, will have problems too. \"All the important hedging that goes on in conversation is lost,\" says Petrie, whose study of email use can be found at <a href=\"http://www.netinvestigations.net\">www.netinvestigations.net</a>. \"People don't put themselves in the position of the recipient. Emails can come across as abrupt and often quite brutal.\" </p> <p>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, in other words. But teachers and parents can do more than merely bring out the familiar assembly theme. You could explain, for example, that some people use <a href=\"http://www.windweaver.com/emoticon.htm\">emoticons</a> to communicate their mood and as a way of making it clear if they're being sarcastic. These are falling out of favour as adults become more familiar with email, but they help to avoid misunderstandings, particularly when children experiment with sarcasm. </p> <p>Another important rule is to avoid SCREAMING - TYPING EVERYTHING IN CAPS. Using a pair of asterixes is a *much* better way of emphasising a word. More guidelines on email etiquette are listed at <a href=\"http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/dec99/pirillo1.htm\">www.writerswrite.com</a> although they will need to be adapted for use with children. </p> <p>But perhaps the best advice, is never to fire off an angry reply to a unexpectedly nasty email. Just as counting to 10 during an argument helps to calm people down, leaving the computer and talking to someone can stop you replying in the heat of the moment. If you're alone, yelling a sardonic reply at the screen can also help defuse the tension. </p> <p>If a child believes someone has sent them a \"hate mail\" of some kind, it shouldn't be too difficult to persuade them to show it to you (just as they would show off a bleeding nose). Then decide together whether to ignore it, or compose a reply. </p> <p>Do you have any other strategies for dealing with difficult emails?

      "bodyText": "\"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me\" Anyone who remembers being bullied and teased as a child will recognise this rhyme as wishful fiction. But what happens when the verbal abuse is not just a throwaway taunt, or even an exchange of insults, but the modern equivalent of what Enid Blyton called \"poison-pen\" letters? Thanks to the ubiquity of email and - for mobile phone owners - text-messaging, children who may object loudly to the notion of writing a letter on paper will happily send messages by email. It helps children to practise putting their thoughts and feelings into words, and the results should show up in the literacy hour and English lessons. It's also inevitable that they will sometimes get it wrong, and the injuries sustained by an email usually take much longer to heal than verbal wounds. Professor Helen Petrie of the University of Hertfordshire says most adults haven't yet learnt how to use email - so it's hardly surprising that children, who don't have a full grasp of linguistic nuances, will have problems too. \"All the important hedging that goes on in conversation is lost,\" says Petrie, whose study of email use can be found at www.netinvestigations.net. \"People don't put themselves in the position of the recipient. Emails can come across as abrupt and often quite brutal.\" Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, in other words. But teachers and parents can do more than merely bring out the familiar assembly theme. You could explain, for example, that some people use emoticons to communicate their mood and as a way of making it clear if they're being sarcastic. These are falling out of favour as adults become more familiar with email, but they help to avoid misunderstandings, particularly when children experiment with sarcasm. Another important rule is to avoid SCREAMING - TYPING EVERYTHING IN CAPS. Using a pair of asterixes is a *much* better way of emphasising a word. More guidelines on email etiquette are listed at www.writerswrite.com although they will need to be adapted for use with children. But perhaps the best advice, is never to fire off an angry reply to a unexpectedly nasty email. Just as counting to 10 during an argument helps to calm people down, leaving the computer and talking to someone can stop you replying in the heat of the moment. If you're alone, yelling a sardonic reply at the screen can also help defuse the tension. If a child believes someone has sent them a \"hate mail\" of some kind, it shouldn't be too difficult to persuade them to show it to you (just as they would show off a bleeding nose). Then decide together whether to ignore it, or compose a reply. Do you have any other strategies for dealing with difficult emails? Tell Education Unlimited about them.

      "body": "<p><strong> Wimbledon School of Art</strong></p> <p> <strong> Hayley Skipper</strong>, 22, produces site-specific work with fairy-tale narratives, juxtaposing nursery images of home with scaffolding structures. Before her show she was sitting in an empty studio negotiating with tree surgeons over the phone to get a consignment of twigs delivered with which to build a giant nest among her other installations.</p> <p>\"I've got 11 days and I don't know if it will work. The pressure is building up because this is the culmination of three years' work. The final mark doesn't really mean anything. You could get a first and nothing will happen, a third and everything will happen because you've presented yourself in the right way to the right people. It's down to how you set about selling yourself as an artist.\" </p> <p><strong> Sam Dowd</strong>, 22, has evolved into a performance and video artist, exploring contemporary myths and \"belief systems\" about masculinity through the images thrown up by childhood rhymes and nonsense poetry. One of his performance installations will involve donning \"armour\" made from domestic items such as Marigold rubber gloves. One of his pieces was recently shortlisted at the ICA Becks awards for young film and video artists.</p> <p>\"All of this is very self-motivated. We are encouraged to do things off our own backs and I wouldn't say there was a house style. I haven't got a job to go to after the show, because I want to be a professional artist which I know is the hardest thing in the world. I think there's probably a let-down after art school. If you are going to get anywhere, it's not what you know but who you know.\" </p> <p><strong> Alice Taminiau</strong> is a mature student from Holland who first went to art school at 15 but dropped out. Wishing to return to art in middle age, she attended art school in Belgium, producing work \"in a certain impressionistic way\". After 18 months Alice again dropped out and applied to Wimbledon, where she has flourished.\"I changed completely,\" she said. \"My work became very conceptual.\" </p> <p>But she has returned to painting and her final show will be a series of still lifes, in which she has taken fragments from her previously academic work and blown them up and transformed them into large abstract oil paintings.</p> <p>\"Now I feel I am just beginning to understand a little bit about art. My show is just a start. One girl here told me she wanted to do something about emancipation and I thought: 'My God, I was around when it was invented.' I'm not interested in all that; I just want to understand what art is. At this college they shake you awake, you are constantly pushed to go one step further. I now want to make a living out of my paintings, so I hope a gallery owner picks me out because I think my work is becoming good. In Holland, galleries want to know where you have studied and if you say 'London' they think 'Wow! that's good.' \"</p> <p> <strong> Newcastle University School of Art</strong></p> <p><strong> Kit Abramson</strong>, 22, chose a disused vaulted storeroom in which to present her degree show, absorbing objects found in the room itself into her art. She is interested in the nature of objects and the layers of meaning we give to them. Kit's show, therefore, includes an amplified spoon which vibrates noisily; a brass cast of her own mouth - \"a prevention of language\"; a video image of a door opening and closing, thrown minutely onto a rough wall; and a headless statue of a dusty muscular male nude that she has salvaged from years of storage and surrounded by soft white pillows. She also has a portfolio of paintings and drawings.</p> <p>\"The brilliant thing about this place is that you can make whatever work you want. Nobody is pushing you into anything at too early a stage, though the life stuff is getting less popular. I do want to work as an artist but I feel there are 101 different ways of doing that. I think the degree show has less pressure up here because you know you're not going to be shuffled off to stardom. However, there's a lot of interest in art round here and a lot going on. There is a feeling that you can make things happen.\" </p> <p><strong> Adam Ball</strong>, 23, will be presenting a series of videos and finely crafted abstract sculptures which transform Mondrian's paintings into still and kinetic 3D objects through which he views and celebrates the urban landscape. </p> <p>One of his videos shows one of his sculptures - based on Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie - \"dancing\" to jazz rhythms. It earned him a prize at the ICA Becks awards. Another video shows Newcastle street life after a football victory - but viewed through a \"Mondrian\" structure placed in the street. </p> <p>Adam wants to move back to his family in London after graduating in the hope of making gallery contacts.</p> <p>\"The Baltic will help but London is the heart of the art world.

      "bodyText": "Wimbledon School of Art Hayley Skipper, 22, produces site-specific work with fairy-tale narratives, juxtaposing nursery images of home with scaffolding structures. Before her show she was sitting in an empty studio negotiating with tree surgeons over the phone to get a consignment of twigs delivered with which to build a giant nest among her other installations. \"I've got 11 days and I don't know if it will work. The pressure is building up because this is the culmination of three years' work. The final mark doesn't really mean anything. You could get a first and nothing will happen, a third and everything will happen because you've presented yourself in the right way to the right people. It's down to how you set about selling yourself as an artist.\" Sam Dowd, 22, has evolved into a performance and video artist, exploring contemporary myths and \"belief systems\" about masculinity through the images thrown up by childhood rhymes and nonsense poetry. One of his performance installations will involve donning \"armour\" made from domestic items such as Marigold rubber gloves. One of his pieces was recently shortlisted at the ICA Becks awards for young film and video artists. \"All of this is very self-motivated. We are encouraged to do things off our own backs and I wouldn't say there was a house style. I haven't got a job to go to after the show, because I want to be a professional artist which I know is the hardest thing in the world. I think there's probably a let-down after art school. If you are going to get anywhere, it's not what you know but who you know.\" Alice Taminiau is a mature student from Holland who first went to art school at 15 but dropped out. Wishing to return to art in middle age, she attended art school in Belgium, producing work \"in a certain impressionistic way\". After 18 months Alice again dropped out and applied to Wimbledon, where she has flourished.\"I changed completely,\" she said. \"My work became very conceptual.\" But she has returned to painting and her final show will be a series of still lifes, in which she has taken fragments from her previously academic work and blown them up and transformed them into large abstract oil paintings. \"Now I feel I am just beginning to understand a little bit about art. My show is just a start. One girl here told me she wanted to do something about emancipation and I thought: 'My God, I was around when it was invented.' I'm not interested in all that; I just want to understand what art is. At this college they shake you awake, you are constantly pushed to go one step further. I now want to make a living out of my paintings, so I hope a gallery owner picks me out because I think my work is becoming good. In Holland, galleries want to know where you have studied and if you say 'London' they think 'Wow! that's good.' \" Newcastle University School of Art Kit Abramson, 22, chose a disused vaulted storeroom in which to present her degree show, absorbing objects found in the room itself into her art. She is interested in the nature of objects and the layers of meaning we give to them. Kit's show, therefore, includes an amplified spoon which vibrates noisily; a brass cast of her own mouth - \"a prevention of language\"; a video image of a door opening and closing, thrown minutely onto a rough wall; and a headless statue of a dusty muscular male nude that she has salvaged from years of storage and surrounded by soft white pillows. She also has a portfolio of paintings and drawings. \"The brilliant thing about this place is that you can make whatever work you want. Nobody is pushing you into anything at too early a stage, though the life stuff is getting less popular. I do want to work as an artist but I feel there are 101 different ways of doing that. I think the degree show has less pressure up here because you know you're not going to be shuffled off to stardom. However, there's a lot of interest in art round here and a lot going on. There is a feeling that you can make things happen.\" Adam Ball, 23, will be presenting a series of videos and finely crafted abstract sculptures which transform Mondrian's paintings into still and kinetic 3D objects through which he views and celebrates the urban landscape. One of his videos shows one of his sculptures - based on Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie - \"dancing\" to jazz rhythms. It earned him a prize at the ICA Becks awards. Another video shows Newcastle street life after a football victory - but viewed through a \"Mondrian\" structure placed in the street. Adam wants to move back to his family in London after graduating in the hope of making gallery contacts. \"The Baltic will help but London is the heart of the art world. I'm not interested in selling my work at this stage. I just want to get as good a degree as I can, because I have worked hard, and to show my work to my family and friends.\" Julian Lee, 27, worked as a builder in London before applying to Newcastle. He had obtained a BTec National Diploma in Art and Design at 18, and had kept up his drawing in an observational, figurative way. He still paints landscapes - huge, dark, surreal portraits of grim urban dereliction. \"My work has changed a lot but it's very much 'open house' at this art school.

In recent years dealers and gallery owners have trawled degree shows to an unprecedented extent, sometimes visiting even before the shows to get first choice. And students, especially those on the London circuit, are highly aware that they are under the spotlight. </p> <p>Christopher Frayling, rector of the Royal College of Art, says art students are under pressure and are exposed in a way students from other disciplines cannot imagine. \"For most students the final exam might mean writing an essay or dissertation for an external examiner. Essentially it's a private transaction. But art students are baring their innermost selves in public. They make their material completely their own, it's like an autobiography, a very personal punchline to two or three years' work. </p> <p>\"I cannot recall since the 1960s as much interest as there has been in shows over the last two or three years. There's a lot of star-spotting going on, and art schools have become very competitive places. There's a lot of jostling for position, a definite Darwinian atmosphere. 'Can they cut it? Have they got it?' These are the questions being asked of talented students.\" </p> <p>Frayling's favourite statistic shows that every three years in Britain we produce more art and design graduates than the whole of the population of Florence during the Renaissance. Not all of them can be adopted by a Saatchi or Serota, though new galleries are opening in London every day and more fine art students, it seems, are entering the charmed circle of living by their art alone. </p> <p>However, the number of art graduates entering into art-related jobs such as commercial art, advertising or arts administration is also high. Frayling believes \"passionately\" in the virtue of an art school education. He says it produces a self-reliant group with the ability to transfer their visual skills into all manner of employment. </p> <p>But he strikes a note of caution on the art-school tendency of producing starlets, of worshipping precocity, of feeding the polarisation between a conceptual avant garde and those concerned with the craft of painting or sculpture: \"There has to be a range of options, a discipline. At 17 you cannot be a Duchamp. If you start from that basis you haven't many options of where to go on to. You have to start with an education.\" </p> <p>The day Hirst had his first famous show, allegedly sending out invitations to all the critics and arranging for them to be picked up in taxis, he started something, says Frayling - how to stage-manage a reputation - that \"we don't know how to resolve\". </p> <p>Students have intensified their strategies to get noticed and shock tactics are the new orthodoxy: \"Every year we can expect to get some gothic shocking stuff from students who want their art to stand out on the shelf and there is nothing more depressing. It takes a maverick to stand out and say, stop the show I want to get off. </p> <p>\"I see our job as developing the whole person, getting students to the starting line. Art schools that see it as their job to turn out professional artists, without giving their students the business skills of how to market their work, find a dealer, run a studio, are creating a paradox. If colleges are saying 'this is a professional vocational course', then they have to equip their students accordingly.\" </p> <p>Wimbledon School of Art has become increasingly popular with students opting for London. Its relatively small size (600 undergraduates, 90 in Fine Art) and good facilities and the top research ratings attained by its staff, all practising artists, have given it a reputation as a strong, highly focused community. </p> <p>Once seen as conservative compared with Goldsmiths or St Martin's, Wimbledon maintains its painting and sculpture schools. Though there are still painters the boundaries have dissolved and its students turn out a high percentage of conceptual and installation work in any format. </p> <p>From day one they are expected to behave like artists and are constantly challenged as artists by staff. The first thing required of freshers is to hold an exhibition of previous work. Throughout their three years undergraduates are encouraged to court galleries and exhibit as often as possible. Their final show is a \"big deal\", says staff, attracting dealers, collectors, critics and other professionals. </p> <p>Students draw up a final show press release, produce a sleek, professional catalogue for which they have to seek sponsorship, set up a sales desk and wait for the cash to roll in. They might not all expect a Mr Waddington to walk their way, but they have all been given the means, says Rod Bugg, the school's head, to carry on their individual practice as artists, and most do. </p> <p>Newcastle University's School of Art forms part of the university's elegant turn-of-the-century buildings. It has its own Hatton Gallery, and offers studio space of a size and proportion that students in London only dream of. Fine-art students do a four-year degree that includes art history, and are expected to build up skills, knowledge and critical appreciation across a range of areas. They spend the first year learning things like colour theory and basic materials. </p> <p>The school retains its life-drawing studios, though the approach is no longer so academic. Students are encouraged to take their work in whatever direction they choose as long as it stands up to critical appraisal. </p> <p>When the degree show opened last Friday, neither staff not students were expecting dealers and galleries to make it up the line from London. Though the school's reputation is growing, its sales pitch is not strident. More support comes from the great and the good from the north-east, the heads of regional art boards and contemporary art spaces. In Newcastle, then, the tension as well as the optimism is just as palpable as in London. After all, this is the home of Gormley's Angel and the designated City of Culture for 2008. The Baltic Flour Mills have been transformed to echo the Tate Modern. There is a strong community of artists. </p> <p>Christopher Jones, head of painting and director of the BA fine art course, feels that being away from the London spotlight has advantages - students feel more able to follow their own inclinations rather than fashion. </p> <p>\"I think the distance lends perspective on the voguish things happening in London,\" he says. \"We have never had a house style.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"It was good to eat but very strange. The taste was something I'd never experienced before,\" said 13-year-old Masahiro Suzukawa thoughtfully about his first encounter with shepherd's pie. With his classmates at Ikuchi Junior High School he had been trying out a recipe emailed by teenagers from the other side of the world. </p> <p>Emails are beginning to fly back and forth between his school on a small island near Hiroshima and Wortley High School in Leeds, its \"e-link\" partner in a British Council scheme. On both sides the kids' curiosity has been aroused - what do you eat/wear/listen to? How long is the school day? What lessons do you have? What sports do you do? </p> <p>The contrasts begin with the schools - one looking out over inner-city terraces, the other by the side of Japan's Inland Sea serving a farming and fishing community - and they encompass almost every aspect of the children's school and personal lives. They have only just begun to explore. </p> <p>Yumi Nakamura, a keen basketball player, described herself as tall - but not as tall, it turned out, as \"Mr Nigel\", a teacher in the Yorkshire school. She and her classmates are working on the idea of making t-shirts based on Japanese calligraphic characters for their Leeds correspondents and would love to visit Britain in the future. Koji Uchiake said they wanted to introduce their English counterparts to Japanese food by sending them recipes. Is Japanese food better? Yes, he said without hesitation. </p> <p>Helped by an English teacher, Matt Lamborne (coincidentally from Leeds himself), the Ikuchi students are creating an English website for the school, ranging from sports (basketball, volleyball, tennis and table tennis - \"Our practice is very strict. We have many trophies\") to the school rules. These may raise eyebrows in Leeds - no perfume, make-up or dyed hair. Students may not bring snacks, girls must not have hair below their shoulders (not an issue for boys, it seems); students living within one kilometre must walk to school - the others come by bike, no one is driven to school. </p> <p>What none of the children mention, because they take it for granted, is the daily cleaning when they take up brooms and mops and clean their classrooms and corridors, the toilets and the school grounds. </p> <p>The project is meant to be fun - but it is also a tiny sign of a revolution brewing in Japanese schools. The country is taking stock of what it needs to survive in the 21st century and seems to be coming to the conclusion that not only will better English be essential for global trade, but that schools and universities should be fostering young peoples' ability to think for themselves.</p> <p>The results of a century of rote learning have been impressive - creating the world's second largest economy - but they are no longer enough for a nation that has to live on its wits. So the government is proposing drastic cuts to the amount of maths, science and Japanese that children have to cover and allowing schools more control over their lessons. The education ministry is even proposing to drop down from six days a week to five. </p> <p>Down the coast in the city of Fukuoka, governor Wataru Aso is a passionate moderniser, pushing internet links and English language in the local schools. \"The need to express themselves on the internet will motivate them to improve their English. In Japan we are pressing ahead with English as a second language but children have difficulty in speaking it fluently - they have limited opportunities to use it outside the classroom.\" He also wants lively debate between children in Japan and other countries through internet links and is keen to see them established. (At least 180 Japanese schools have requested e-links to Britain and the British Council is struggling to keep up with demand.) </p> <p>During three years in London, he sent his daughters to St Mary Abbott primary in Kensington and is very positive about the education they received.

      "bodyText": "\"It was good to eat but very strange. The taste was something I'd never experienced before,\" said 13-year-old Masahiro Suzukawa thoughtfully about his first encounter with shepherd's pie. With his classmates at Ikuchi Junior High School he had been trying out a recipe emailed by teenagers from the other side of the world. Emails are beginning to fly back and forth between his school on a small island near Hiroshima and Wortley High School in Leeds, its \"e-link\" partner in a British Council scheme. On both sides the kids' curiosity has been aroused - what do you eat/wear/listen to? How long is the school day? What lessons do you have? What sports do you do? The contrasts begin with the schools - one looking out over inner-city terraces, the other by the side of Japan's Inland Sea serving a farming and fishing community - and they encompass almost every aspect of the children's school and personal lives. They have only just begun to explore. Yumi Nakamura, a keen basketball player, described herself as tall - but not as tall, it turned out, as \"Mr Nigel\", a teacher in the Yorkshire school. She and her classmates are working on the idea of making t-shirts based on Japanese calligraphic characters for their Leeds correspondents and would love to visit Britain in the future. Koji Uchiake said they wanted to introduce their English counterparts to Japanese food by sending them recipes. Is Japanese food better? Yes, he said without hesitation. Helped by an English teacher, Matt Lamborne (coincidentally from Leeds himself), the Ikuchi students are creating an English website for the school, ranging from sports (basketball, volleyball, tennis and table tennis - \"Our practice is very strict. We have many trophies\") to the school rules. These may raise eyebrows in Leeds - no perfume, make-up or dyed hair. Students may not bring snacks, girls must not have hair below their shoulders (not an issue for boys, it seems); students living within one kilometre must walk to school - the others come by bike, no one is driven to school. What none of the children mention, because they take it for granted, is the daily cleaning when they take up brooms and mops and clean their classrooms and corridors, the toilets and the school grounds. The project is meant to be fun - but it is also a tiny sign of a revolution brewing in Japanese schools. The country is taking stock of what it needs to survive in the 21st century and seems to be coming to the conclusion that not only will better English be essential for global trade, but that schools and universities should be fostering young peoples' ability to think for themselves. The results of a century of rote learning have been impressive - creating the world's second largest economy - but they are no longer enough for a nation that has to live on its wits. So the government is proposing drastic cuts to the amount of maths, science and Japanese that children have to cover and allowing schools more control over their lessons. The education ministry is even proposing to drop down from six days a week to five. Down the coast in the city of Fukuoka, governor Wataru Aso is a passionate moderniser, pushing internet links and English language in the local schools. \"The need to express themselves on the internet will motivate them to improve their English. In Japan we are pressing ahead with English as a second language but children have difficulty in speaking it fluently - they have limited opportunities to use it outside the classroom.\" He also wants lively debate between children in Japan and other countries through internet links and is keen to see them established. (At least 180 Japanese schools have requested e-links to Britain and the British Council is struggling to keep up with demand.) During three years in London, he sent his daughters to St Mary Abbott primary in Kensington and is very positive about the education they received. He had been anxious they would not be able to keep up with the class and would become phobic about school, but because pupils were given different assignments according to the level they had reached they were happy and were able to progress. (Behaviour was another matter. One very un-Japanese phrase they picked up was \"It's not my fault\", he recalled.) \"In the British system children learn to stand up for themselves and learn for themselves - that's the big difference I have found.\" In the city's Chikushi high school, 38 16- and 17-year-olds are engaged in a game of whispers with their teachers Elizabeth Ottewell and Kunicko Eguchi, passing directions in English from the back to the front of the class.

Last night Whitehall continued to side with the US and Canada in their long-running trade war with the EU over the 12-year-old Europe-wide ban on the use of hormones in beef. Downing Street says that no Whitehall ministry is now blocking the compromise on bananas either. Nick Brown, agriculture minister, said there was no scientific justification for the ban, which also applies to imports, and last year prompted tit-for-tat action, involving punitive 100% US tariffs, on selected goods from all EU countries except Britain. The goods included French cheese and truffles, French and German mustard. The tariffs were designed to make up for trade losses totalling nearly $117m (\u00a373m). There is no question of Britain opting out of the EU ban but its continuing support for the US position means it is unlikely to face any retaliation for the foreseeable future. Coincidentally, the Scottish Office minister, Brian Wilson, protested at EU lethargy about failure to meet the terms of the World Trade Organisation ruling to allow more non-Caribbean bananas into EU markets, notably Germany where bananas are popular. \"Fifteen months have now elapsed since the WTO panel once again found against the EU on this issue. To any objective observer, it is incomprehensible that these 15 months have not been sufficient to bring this whole matter to a WTO-compliant conclusion,\" he told Scots MPs.",

      "bodyText": "Computer hard drives holding some of the United States' most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets have vanished from a vault at the Los Alamos research laboratory, in New Mexico, the US department of energy admitted yesterday. An official statement said the disappearance of the electronic files was \"an extremely serious matter\", but added that it was too early to blame their absence on espionage. A desperate search of the laboratories was under way last night, in the hope that the drives had simply been mislaid. The hard drives had been stored in special containers in a vault in the research centre's X division, where nuclear weapons are designed. They include data on weapons used by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, which is deployed in the event of nuclear accidents or nuclear threats from terrorists. It therefore contains all the information necessary to render nuclear devices safe in emergencies. The drives also held information about the Russian nuclear weapons programme, and details of Russian technology. The drives were discovered to be missing on June 1, as brush fires burnt around the Los Alamos area, threatening the laboratories themselves - the site of the first nuclear explosion in 1945. When officials went to transfer the data for safekeeping, they found only empty containers. \"This is an extremely serious matter, and we are taking swift actions to deal with it,\" said John Browne, the director of the federal weapons research laboratory. An energy department press release said: \"Officials are conducting an exhaustive search of computers, safes, containers and vaults and are interviewing all staff members who had access to the vault where the media were stored.\" Ed Curran, the director of the energy department's counter-intelligence unit, insisted yesterday that: \"At this point there is no evidence that suggests espionage is involved in this incident.\" Normal work at the laboratory was suspended to allow technicians to join the search, and energy department officials said that all employees with access to the vault may have to undergo polygraph \"lie-detector\" tests as part of the inquiry, being pursued jointly with the FBI. The embarrassment could not have come at a worse time for the energy secretary, Bill Richardson. The Los Alamos laboratory was already in the midst of a security review following the arrest last year of one of its scientists, Wen Ho Lee, who is awaiting trial for allegedly transferring secret information from secure to unsecure computers and computer tapes. It is still unclear what happened to the computer tapes and Mr Lee has not been charged with espionage. The hard drives in the X division laboratory reportedly went missing after Mr Lee first came under suspicion and was dismissed. The head of the energy department's security section, Eugene Habiger, who is leading the search for the missing information, said the chaos caused by the New Mexico wildfires might be a factor in the continued absence of the files, suggesting that perhaps a laboratory employee took them when forced to evacuate the area. \"Our inquiry has been conducted during a period in which employees are still recovering from the effects of a major emergency disaster,\" Mr Habiger said. After Mr Lee was dismissed last April, the energy department was the subject of withering criticism from Republican leaders, who accused the government of letting its guard down in a matter of critical national security. As a result of the scandal, Mr Richardson ordered a shutdown of the laboratory's computer systems and gave instructions for Los Alamos employees to undergo security training sessions. Congress later passed measures to establish a new nuclear weapons agency within the energy department specifically to oversee the weapons laboratories. Security officials quoted on the New York Times website late yesterday evening said the energy department had initially played down the importance of the incident, believing that the hard drives would turn up. But the fact that the missing hard drives contained files of intelligence reports has raised suspicions of espionage.",

Some even border on incitement.\" It has taken other European societies centuries to develop key components of democracy and inclusion - law, order, free expression, political parties with developed election manifestos, freedom to register to vote and to place your votes in safety and secrecy, without fear of intimidation. From a US perspective, Kosovo was always likely to be a minor problem in a faraway place, a tiny province in a tiny nation tucked away in the cockpit of Europe, or a Somalia in the making. Holding elections must seem a reasonable and honourable way to restore democracy. Holding them so prematurely, as part of the not-so-hidden agenda to get the heck out, is not especially honourable. Indeed, it dishonours democracy. It dishonours the tax-payers who funded the estimated $35bn to free Kosovo for democracy and entry into the European family. It dishonours the forces that rescued Kosovo from Milosevic's maw. The last helicopter is revving up on the roof-top. Lesley Abdela served in Kosovo in 1993 as deputy director for democracy at the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Deputy prime minister John Prescott's housebuilding policy suffered an embarrassing setback yesterday when councils in the south-east united to reject government targets for new homes. The government faced pressure to cut back its plans for 43,000 extra homes to be built annually in the region when Conservatives on the planning authority backed a lower target of 33,000 homes a year for five years, claiming government proposals were \"unachievable\". The decision, which councillors insisted was based on concern that the government plan would mean \"concreting over the countryside for ever\", provoked Labour accusations that the Conservative leadership was seeking to \"play politics with people's homes\". The shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, pressurised Tory councils on the all-party south-east regional planning conference (Serplan) in advance of yesterday's vote, the housing minister, Nick Raynsford, claimed. Labour councillors said the party-lines split on the issue meant that the authority had now become politicised and might never recover. Meanwhile environmental and countryside groups warned ministers against clashing head-on with local authorities over housing, arguing that measures were not yet in place to make a reality of government targets for more building on recycled land. Tony Burton, the assistant director of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said: \"Tax breaks for urban renewal, extra funds for affordable homes and positive action to promote more even development around the regions are all needed before the government can consider raising housebuilding levels in the south-east.\" In a warning that will alarm ministers who feel they have lost the confidence of middle England, Tony Bosworth of Friends of the Earth said imposing thousands of new houses on the region would store up \"real electoral problems\" for the government. Serplan rejected by a majority of 39 to 30, with one abstention, government proposals to build an extra 860,000 homes across the 12 counties in the south-east outside Greater London. An alternative proposal by Labour councillors for 39,000 new homes annually was rejected by Tory members of the authority, who argued that the need for the numbers of homes proposed by Mr Prescott had not been proven. It also said that the government's figures would require an annual rate of housebuilding - around 47,000 new houses a year in 2006 to 2016 - which exceeded any previous level and was \"therefore unachievable\". The row was provoked by an inquiry by a panel chaired by Professor Stephen Crow into Serplan's original baseline recommendation last October that 33,300 homes should be built annually. Mr Prescott rejected this target and suggested a compromise figure of 43,000. This proposal, rejected yesterday by councillors, is out to consultation which closes on June 19. Mr Raynsford said he regretted that the \"tradition of cross-party consensus that has characterised Serplan's way of working in the past has been set aside in favour of party-political division\". The government would consider the views of both factions in the authority as well as more than 200 other submissions before reaching a decision in the autumn, he said. Conservative opposition to plans for more affordable housing in the south-east would fuel house price inflation and force the children of local people to move away, he warned. But Mr Norman insisted councillors in the region were \"standing up for their residents\". He said: \"They have every right to do so. The people in the south-east have now spoken. The government is committed to building the wrong houses in the wrong places, more than half will be built on green fields, countryside will be concreted over for ever and the vicious cycle of migration from the inner cities will continue.\" Mr Prescott wants 60% of new homes on brownfield former industrial sites. But opponents argue there are fewer suitable brownfield sites in the region than in the north of England and green fields will be at risk. But Labour councillors on Serplan accused the Tories of \"breathtaking hypocrisy\", saying it was a Tory minister who ruined green fields with the building boom in the 1980s.",

The group said it had targeted the defence attache because of his role in Nato's \"barbaric airstrikes\" against Yugoslavia last year.

No member of November 17, an ultra-leftist urban gang without any clear political objective, has been captured or identified in the 25 years since it emerged with the slaying of Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in Athens. Brig Saunders was its 23rd victim. Despite almost all of Athens' 15,000-strong police force being seconded to the job, no progress has been made in tracking down the two men who fatally shot the soldier in a ride-by assault as he drove to work last Thursday. For the first time, investigators have failed to find the assassins' motorbike, which could, they say, provide critical DNA evidence. On the suggestion of three Scotland Yard counter-terrorist officials already in the capital, Greek police are considering an appeal for people to come forward with information. \"But,\" said one government insider, \"that sort of thing is not so easy here because people still have very bitter memories of the dictatorship and being an informant has very strong associations even if it's for the good of the country and is very effective.\" Greece said it would also discuss other ways of fighting terrorism with Britain on a European Union level at a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg today. Under renewed pressure from Washington, the ruling Socialists have also said they will improve the country's anti-terrorism legislation by introducing witness protection and doing away with juries in terrorist cases.

      "body": "<p>A gynaecologist who worked in North Yorkshire for 10 years after having his licence revoked in Canada was yesterday accused of a catalogue of botched operations, incompetence and negligence which left women bleeding and in agony during a 17-year UK career.</p> <p>Richard Neale denied the complaints relating to 14 women patients and charges of fraudulently claiming qualifications he did not possess, at a disciplinary tribunal of the General Medical Council yesterday. Dozens of women who claim they have been damaged by him over more than a decade travelled to London to watch the start of the hearings. The GMC investigated more than 60 complaints before deciding which to pursue.</p> <p>Sheila Wright-Hogeland, who founded a support group for Mr Neale's patients, said: \"We have all gone through a lot of pain and suffering and we hope that the GMC will take action to make sure that no doctor can work in this country if they have been struck off in any other country.\"</p> <p>Vivian Robinson QC, presenting the case against Mr Neale on behalf of the GMC, said there was an accumulation of evidence against him. \"The council say the picture which emerges in this case is one of serious incidents of clinical incompetence and of professional negligence and in one instance appalling rudeness to a patient.\"</p> <p><b> Incompetence</b><br></p> <p>His incompetence showed in his surgery, said Mr Robinson. Several charges relate to hysterectomies he chose to perform by keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). When complications arose, he should have switched to the open technique - the normal method of surgery - in which he was competent. But he did not, and several women were left with perforated bladders and incontinence problems.</p> <p>His negligence showed in his failure to carry out all the checks he should have made before and after surgery - the x-rays and mammograms which show up any problems. He took far too long to act when women he had operated on complained of pain and incontinence. His patients signed consent forms, but sometimes the operation he performed was not the one he had told them he would do.</p> <p>Probably the worst case before the GMC is the treatment received by a woman referred to as Mrs B, to protect her anonymity and the confidentiality of medical records. She was diagnosed with endometriosis - where hormone-bearing tissue that lines the womb occurs in places it should not - by a doctor in Paris.</p> <p>By 1990, it had apparently cleared up with drug treatment, but later that year, \"she suffered severe pelvic and abdominal pains, causing her to collapse on to the kitchen floor,\" said Mr Robinson. Mr Neale, her consultant, dismissed them as ovulation pains. In May 1991, after a second collapse in New York, a doctor there told her to see a gynaecologist as soon as she got home. Mr Neale said he had seen her in March and she was fine.</p> <p>\"Over the next five years, acute shooting and stabbing pelvic and abdominal pains continued,\" said Mr Robinson. \"Mr Neale dismissed them as natural ovulation and told her to stop worrying.\"</p> <p>By December 1994, not only were the pains more frequent, but Mrs B was experiencing bleeding. In January 1995, Mr Neale noticed her swollen abdomen. An ultrasound scan confirmed that there were serious problems. On February 1, Mr Neale told the patient that it was the worst case of endometriosis he had ever seen. She had a total hysterectomy and there was no possibility of saving even a part of an ovary, as she had wanted.</p> <p>\"He said if he had known, he would have operated on her as an emergency case a lot sooner,\" said Mr Robinson. \"He said, you must have been in great pain. She reminded him that she had been telling him about the pelvic pains for four years. It appears that Mr Neale then became very arrogant.\"</p> <p>Mrs B was very unhappy with what had happened. \"There was a conversation between them about the treatment she had had for her condition. There came a stage when he raised his voice considerably. She left the room and went to the waiting area. He placed himself between her and the door and said she would live to regret it if she brought a lawsuit or complaint against him,\" Mr Robinson said.</p> <p>She consulted another gynaecologist in York and then went with her husband to try to get her medical records from Mr Neale. \"Mr Neale refused to hand over copies of the notes, saying he would provide them in his own good time. Mr Neale followed her into the waiting room and proceeded to have a tantrum.\" He said Mrs B described him screaming petulantly and stamping his feet. \"She felt he behaved appallingly.\"</p> <p>Mrs B suffered a premature menopause as a result of Mr Neale's failure to detect her endometriosis earlier, said Mr Robinson. Had he acted sooner, some ovarian function could have been preserved.</p> <p>In one of the cases against him, Mr Neale is acused of falsely telling a patient that she would have to wait five months for a hysterectomy on the NHS, when the true time was a matter of weeks, so that she would pay him to carry it out privately.

      "bodyText": "A gynaecologist who worked in North Yorkshire for 10 years after having his licence revoked in Canada was yesterday accused of a catalogue of botched operations, incompetence and negligence which left women bleeding and in agony during a 17-year UK career. Richard Neale denied the complaints relating to 14 women patients and charges of fraudulently claiming qualifications he did not possess, at a disciplinary tribunal of the General Medical Council yesterday. Dozens of women who claim they have been damaged by him over more than a decade travelled to London to watch the start of the hearings. The GMC investigated more than 60 complaints before deciding which to pursue. Sheila Wright-Hogeland, who founded a support group for Mr Neale's patients, said: \"We have all gone through a lot of pain and suffering and we hope that the GMC will take action to make sure that no doctor can work in this country if they have been struck off in any other country.\" Vivian Robinson QC, presenting the case against Mr Neale on behalf of the GMC, said there was an accumulation of evidence against him. \"The council say the picture which emerges in this case is one of serious incidents of clinical incompetence and of professional negligence and in one instance appalling rudeness to a patient.\" Incompetence His incompetence showed in his surgery, said Mr Robinson. Several charges relate to hysterectomies he chose to perform by keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). When complications arose, he should have switched to the open technique - the normal method of surgery - in which he was competent. But he did not, and several women were left with perforated bladders and incontinence problems. His negligence showed in his failure to carry out all the checks he should have made before and after surgery - the x-rays and mammograms which show up any problems. He took far too long to act when women he had operated on complained of pain and incontinence. His patients signed consent forms, but sometimes the operation he performed was not the one he had told them he would do. Probably the worst case before the GMC is the treatment received by a woman referred to as Mrs B, to protect her anonymity and the confidentiality of medical records. She was diagnosed with endometriosis - where hormone-bearing tissue that lines the womb occurs in places it should not - by a doctor in Paris. By 1990, it had apparently cleared up with drug treatment, but later that year, \"she suffered severe pelvic and abdominal pains, causing her to collapse on to the kitchen floor,\" said Mr Robinson. Mr Neale, her consultant, dismissed them as ovulation pains. In May 1991, after a second collapse in New York, a doctor there told her to see a gynaecologist as soon as she got home. Mr Neale said he had seen her in March and she was fine. \"Over the next five years, acute shooting and stabbing pelvic and abdominal pains continued,\" said Mr Robinson. \"Mr Neale dismissed them as natural ovulation and told her to stop worrying.\" By December 1994, not only were the pains more frequent, but Mrs B was experiencing bleeding. In January 1995, Mr Neale noticed her swollen abdomen. An ultrasound scan confirmed that there were serious problems. On February 1, Mr Neale told the patient that it was the worst case of endometriosis he had ever seen. She had a total hysterectomy and there was no possibility of saving even a part of an ovary, as she had wanted. \"He said if he had known, he would have operated on her as an emergency case a lot sooner,\" said Mr Robinson. \"He said, you must have been in great pain. She reminded him that she had been telling him about the pelvic pains for four years. It appears that Mr Neale then became very arrogant.\" Mrs B was very unhappy with what had happened. \"There was a conversation between them about the treatment she had had for her condition. There came a stage when he raised his voice considerably. She left the room and went to the waiting area. He placed himself between her and the door and said she would live to regret it if she brought a lawsuit or complaint against him,\" Mr Robinson said. She consulted another gynaecologist in York and then went with her husband to try to get her medical records from Mr Neale. \"Mr Neale refused to hand over copies of the notes, saying he would provide them in his own good time. Mr Neale followed her into the waiting room and proceeded to have a tantrum.\" He said Mrs B described him screaming petulantly and stamping his feet. \"She felt he behaved appallingly.\" Mrs B suffered a premature menopause as a result of Mr Neale's failure to detect her endometriosis earlier, said Mr Robinson. Had he acted sooner, some ovarian function could have been preserved. In one of the cases against him, Mr Neale is acused of falsely telling a patient that she would have to wait five months for a hysterectomy on the NHS, when the true time was a matter of weeks, so that she would pay him to carry it out privately. In two other cases, Mr Neale is accused of leaving needles and suture materials inside women's bodies, which led to complications, pain and further operations. Three years ago, Mr Neale answered an advert placed by the GMC for performance assessors. They were needed to assess the skills and competence of doctors who were suspected of falling below standard. Mr Neale was approved in September 1997 and was provisionally included on the GMC list of assessors. But his CV was fraudulent, it is alleged.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Until it developed an 8in \"wobble\" that terrified its first users and caused its temporary closure, London's new Millennium Bridge had been floating on a tide of enraptured praise. The \"blade of light\" that Lord Foster of Thameside has suspended between St Paul's and Tate Modern is actually of wider significance than its architectural merits - or otherwise - necessarily suggest. A thing of pedestrian pleasure rather than motorised utility, it testifies to the fact that Londoners are rediscovering the Thames as something quite other than the \"dirty old river\" of habitual description, and finding newly genial forms of public life in places that were once more or less abandoned to the homeless and outcast.</p> <p>Encouraged by the surging property market and a new planning framework that demands ambitious \"landmark\" buildings as well as the conservation of historic buildings and views, developers are pressing in on the river with big residential propositions. However, in London as in Tyneside and Belfast, the transformation is being led by large-scale cultural projects.</p> <p>That imposing palace of state bureaucracy, Somerset House, is being opened on the north bank. Out go the clerks and in comes the Gilbert Collection: a riot of gaudy jewel-encrusted snuff-boxes and a splendid waxwork model of the recently knighted donor: an elderly Californian property developer who will be forever lounging at his desk in tennis shoes.</p> <p>Yet it is on the south bank of the Thames that the real breakthrough is taking place. There are still dead stretches opposite and upriver from the Houses of Parliament where the stroller has to negotiate a forest of security cameras. And County Hall can hardly be said to have come together since 1992, when it was acquired by a Japanese corporation. The recarved and multiply tenanted former seat of the Greater London Council now looks like a corporate squat. Yet it also forms the land-base for the huge wheel of the London Eye, a brilliant innovation that enables the citizen to look down on the Houses of Parliament and assorted ministries of state from a great and belittling height.</p> <p>From this crowded democratic spot, you can wander past public sculptures and through the soon to be refurbished South Bank Centre, a famously brutalist concrete warren which, despite habitual moaning, has actually been embraced by a richly varied London public. Next comes the National Theatre, and from there it is possible to follow the river through to the massive edifice of Tate Modern, which has been clocking in 3,000 visitors per hour, and the Globe Theatre in Southwark, where tourists jostle with the members of a more indigenous New Elizabethan subculture. With the new Millennium Bridge, this teeming, convivial, and largely car-free stretch of the river is now surely remarkable enough to convince even the most loyal of countrydwellers that the city may be the place to go if you want a really interesting riverside walk.</p> <p>Just as intolerant rural incomers resent the crowing cocks that wake them up in the morning, people who now live in the converted warehouses near Tower Bridge complain of being disturbed by the amplified warnings directed at motorists and pedestrians whenever the bridge is raised or lowered. Yet these minor irritations only serve to illustrate one of the preconditions of the new Thames: namely that the working river of old is almost completely dead. Indeed, the once industrious Pool of London is now so quiet that David Mellor, who lives in the Harbour Master's house at St Katharine's Dock, can record his Sunday morning Classic FM programme without leaving his house.</p> <p>That would not have been possible in 1965, when the world watched as Churchill's draped coffin was ceremoniously taken up the London Thames to the accompaniment of a 19-gun salute. In those grainy, black and white days there were still waterside cranes to dip ceremoniously in tribute. Perhaps that was the last great sighting of the London river as a working entity, with its own population, culture and political traditions. Its waters had already been dubbed \"liquid history\", but the man who coined that phrase, the Scottish Londoner John Burns, was not trying to lure tourists into riverside restaurants. A Liberal activist and politician, he had been among the radical leaders of the first Great Dock Strike of 1889.</p> <p>By the early 1980s, the London docks had been killed off by containerisation. For years, walking through the old dockland areas was a bleak and lonely business. Yet sharp-eyed property developers were already alchemizing the redundant London river into a lucrative view. It seemed an unlikely ploy to begin with, but you only have to walk down Wapping High Street now to realise that the whole history of the Port of London was just a roundabout way of bringing Manhattan-style loft-living to the Thames.</p> <p>Anyone interested in contemplating this recent conversion of the river would do well to visit Oxo Tower Wharf, between the London Eye and Tate Modern on the south bank. In the old London this was a meat warehouse dedicated to producing not just Oxo cubes but also the curiously extended tubular eggs that still run through some pork pies. No such item appears on the menu of the restaurant that Harvey Nichols now operate on the top floor.</p> <p>From this smart and highly successful institution you can look out from your balcony seat and let your eye drift across the river to the City and the great dome of St Paul's. You may feel pretty good about yourself as all that money and tradition come together in your eye, but to look across the river from this new vantage point is to recognise that London has arrived too.</p> <p>Oxo Tower is by no means the first restaurant to set out to alchemize the dirty old river into a radiant and dreamy prospect. Before it came the BluePrint Caf\u00e9 at the Design Museum - which once seemed dangerously downstream at Butler's Wharf - the River Caf\u00e9 and the ever more ironically named People's Palace at the Royal Festival Hall. It wasn't that many restaurants ago that an ordinary green pepper seemed like an exotic item in England.</p> <p>Take the lift downwards and Oxo Tower Wharf turns into a building that proves you don't always have to be a millionaire to live in a riverside loft. There are workshops and several floors of social housing, run by staff who draw a certain satisfaction from telling prosperous inquirers that they earn far too much to be allowed anywhere near the waiting list for a flat. Oxo Tower Wharf is part of the Coin Street development, and the story of its conversion reveals something of the cost of reconfiguring the Thames as a view.</p> <p>It was in the early 80s that the Coin Street Action Group fought off the developers, who planned to demolish Oxo Tower Wharf and other industrial buildings in the area and replace them with a 20-storey office block designed by Richard Rogers, at that time known as The Cossack of Coin Street rather than Lord Rogers of Riverside. As had happened earlier at Covent Garden, the site was saved by local community action. Eventually assisted by the GLC, the residents, threatened with displacement, acquired the various industrial properties and set about building low-cost housing. They also opened access to a stretch of the riverfront that had been closed for some two centuries. Writing in the New Statesman, the architecture critic Jules Lubbock commended the Coin Street Action Group for opening a new view across the river to St Paul's, the cathedral that had been the \"very symbol of the British people in the face of Nazism\" but which had since been \"shamefully mutilated\" by post-war developers.</p> <p>At that time Lubbock was among Prince Charles's architectural advisers, and a few weeks later, that same argument about St Paul's turned up in Prince Charles's Mansion House speech, in which the traditional look of St Paul's cathedral was used to redeclare the memory of the second world war against the peace that had followed it. Prince Charles chose to launch his revivalist \"Vision of Britain\" with the help of Turner's view of St Paul's, looking up the Thames from Greenwich, and also Canaletto's earlier downriver view from the terrace of Somerset House. By the time Charles and his advisers had finished with the dome of St Paul's, the whole question of the city and its future was lost in a barren argument about architectural styles, with modernism being bad and undue praise falling on classical revivalism.</p> <p>To look out from Oxo Tower Wharf now is to realise how far we've have come since that chaotic, largely ghost-written argument. St Paul's looks fine, and the architects have recovered too. The same cannot be said for the tradition of state-led social reform, which got written off as so many infernal council tower blocks. As for the \"public access\" that is now routinely demanded in riverside planning, that has already come to mean considerably more than the right to squeeze past private residential fortresses and their security systems. The south bank especially has become a new public amenity, which is already changing the feel of London: it's an energetically mixed-up place, where Londoners encounter one another in their flamboyant post-colonial diversity while tourists from more monocultural places boggle enviously at the result.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the river itself is becoming something more than just a moneyed view. Mark Rylance, the artistic director at the Globe Theatre, describes it as both sinister and inspiring, a brown deity that brings nature and myth into the midst of an over-controlled city. The London Rivers Association has also been working to intensify the meaning of the resurgent and successfully cleaned-up river, insisting that it should be seen as an \"ecological super-highway\" and \"reservoir of memory\", and disconcerting some architects by describing it as a potential \"blue-belt\" and nature reserve.</p> <p>As ever, the money will look after itself. But Ken Livingstone is plainly the man to take the public aspect of the new river further. As the figure responsible for \"promoting the wellbeing of London and Londoners\", the new mayor doesn't have to confine his attention entirely to London's irksome transport problems. His real job is to be the patron of London's new public domain, and the river should be among his focal points.</p> <p>It can be assumed that Livingstone will do everything he can to establish that cosmopolitanism is one of the great qualities of London's people rather than just its most exotic cuisine. Since wandering about, whether in a spirit of curiosity or of mutual exhibitionism, is to play such a considerable part in new London life, he should preside over a general increase in public litter bins - early casualties of the IRA, who seem to have provided every cost-cutting bureaucrat in the country with the excuse to get rid of them. He might also encourage the return of herbaceous borders: traditional but labour-intensive features of municipal parks that were among the first victims of council job cuts in the 80s.</p> <p>If further measures are needed to dispel any hint of smugness that may already be arising in this perfect new metropolitan world, Livingstone might consider reviving an ancient river custom that was unaccountably missing from the watery scenes of Shakespeare in Love. In the days when watermen propelled wherries and other such floating taxis up and down the London river, their passengers used to enjoy hurling insults at one another. Samuel Johnson was proud of the killer line with which he put an end to one such virtuoso contest: \"Sir, your wife, under pretence of keeping a bawdy house, is a receiver of stolen goods.\" That particular example would only cause perplexity if called out from the wind-buffeted Millennium Bridge today, but more appropriate versions would surely be forthcoming with a little encouragement.</p> <p><b>The sites on the Thames</b></p> <p>St Katharine's Dock</p> <p>Battersea Power Station</p> <p>Design Museum</p> <p>County Hall/London Aquarium</p> <p>Canary Wharf</p> <p>London Eye</p> <p>Millennium Dome</p> <p>South Bank Centre</p> <p>Somerset House</p> <p>Oxo Tower Wharf/Coin Street</p> <p>Tate Modern</p> <p>Millennium Bridge</p> <p>Globe Theatre</p> <p>Site of new GLA building</p>",

      "bodyText": "Until it developed an 8in \"wobble\" that terrified its first users and caused its temporary closure, London's new Millennium Bridge had been floating on a tide of enraptured praise. The \"blade of light\" that Lord Foster of Thameside has suspended between St Paul's and Tate Modern is actually of wider significance than its architectural merits - or otherwise - necessarily suggest. A thing of pedestrian pleasure rather than motorised utility, it testifies to the fact that Londoners are rediscovering the Thames as something quite other than the \"dirty old river\" of habitual description, and finding newly genial forms of public life in places that were once more or less abandoned to the homeless and outcast. Encouraged by the surging property market and a new planning framework that demands ambitious \"landmark\" buildings as well as the conservation of historic buildings and views, developers are pressing in on the river with big residential propositions. However, in London as in Tyneside and Belfast, the transformation is being led by large-scale cultural projects. That imposing palace of state bureaucracy, Somerset House, is being opened on the north bank. Out go the clerks and in comes the Gilbert Collection: a riot of gaudy jewel-encrusted snuff-boxes and a splendid waxwork model of the recently knighted donor: an elderly Californian property developer who will be forever lounging at his desk in tennis shoes. Yet it is on the south bank of the Thames that the real breakthrough is taking place. There are still dead stretches opposite and upriver from the Houses of Parliament where the stroller has to negotiate a forest of security cameras. And County Hall can hardly be said to have come together since 1992, when it was acquired by a Japanese corporation. The recarved and multiply tenanted former seat of the Greater London Council now looks like a corporate squat. Yet it also forms the land-base for the huge wheel of the London Eye, a brilliant innovation that enables the citizen to look down on the Houses of Parliament and assorted ministries of state from a great and belittling height. From this crowded democratic spot, you can wander past public sculptures and through the soon to be refurbished South Bank Centre, a famously brutalist concrete warren which, despite habitual moaning, has actually been embraced by a richly varied London public. Next comes the National Theatre, and from there it is possible to follow the river through to the massive edifice of Tate Modern, which has been clocking in 3,000 visitors per hour, and the Globe Theatre in Southwark, where tourists jostle with the members of a more indigenous New Elizabethan subculture. With the new Millennium Bridge, this teeming, convivial, and largely car-free stretch of the river is now surely remarkable enough to convince even the most loyal of countrydwellers that the city may be the place to go if you want a really interesting riverside walk. Just as intolerant rural incomers resent the crowing cocks that wake them up in the morning, people who now live in the converted warehouses near Tower Bridge complain of being disturbed by the amplified warnings directed at motorists and pedestrians whenever the bridge is raised or lowered. Yet these minor irritations only serve to illustrate one of the preconditions of the new Thames: namely that the working river of old is almost completely dead. Indeed, the once industrious Pool of London is now so quiet that David Mellor, who lives in the Harbour Master's house at St Katharine's Dock, can record his Sunday morning Classic FM programme without leaving his house. That would not have been possible in 1965, when the world watched as Churchill's draped coffin was ceremoniously taken up the London Thames to the accompaniment of a 19-gun salute. In those grainy, black and white days there were still waterside cranes to dip ceremoniously in tribute. Perhaps that was the last great sighting of the London river as a working entity, with its own population, culture and political traditions. Its waters had already been dubbed \"liquid history\", but the man who coined that phrase, the Scottish Londoner John Burns, was not trying to lure tourists into riverside restaurants. A Liberal activist and politician, he had been among the radical leaders of the first Great Dock Strike of 1889. By the early 1980s, the London docks had been killed off by containerisation. For years, walking through the old dockland areas was a bleak and lonely business. Yet sharp-eyed property developers were already alchemizing the redundant London river into a lucrative view. It seemed an unlikely ploy to begin with, but you only have to walk down Wapping High Street now to realise that the whole history of the Port of London was just a roundabout way of bringing Manhattan-style loft-living to the Thames. Anyone interested in contemplating this recent conversion of the river would do well to visit Oxo Tower Wharf, between the London Eye and Tate Modern on the south bank. In the old London this was a meat warehouse dedicated to producing not just Oxo cubes but also the curiously extended tubular eggs that still run through some pork pies. No such item appears on the menu of the restaurant that Harvey Nichols now operate on the top floor. From this smart and highly successful institution you can look out from your balcony seat and let your eye drift across the river to the City and the great dome of St Paul's. You may feel pretty good about yourself as all that money and tradition come together in your eye, but to look across the river from this new vantage point is to recognise that London has arrived too. Oxo Tower is by no means the first restaurant to set out to alchemize the dirty old river into a radiant and dreamy prospect. Before it came the BluePrint Caf\u00e9 at the Design Museum - which once seemed dangerously downstream at Butler's Wharf - the River Caf\u00e9 and the ever more ironically named People's Palace at the Royal Festival Hall. It wasn't that many restaurants ago that an ordinary green pepper seemed like an exotic item in England. Take the lift downwards and Oxo Tower Wharf turns into a building that proves you don't always have to be a millionaire to live in a riverside loft. There are workshops and several floors of social housing, run by staff who draw a certain satisfaction from telling prosperous inquirers that they earn far too much to be allowed anywhere near the waiting list for a flat. Oxo Tower Wharf is part of the Coin Street development, and the story of its conversion reveals something of the cost of reconfiguring the Thames as a view. It was in the early 80s that the Coin Street Action Group fought off the developers, who planned to demolish Oxo Tower Wharf and other industrial buildings in the area and replace them with a 20-storey office block designed by Richard Rogers, at that time known as The Cossack of Coin Street rather than Lord Rogers of Riverside. As had happened earlier at Covent Garden, the site was saved by local community action. Eventually assisted by the GLC, the residents, threatened with displacement, acquired the various industrial properties and set about building low-cost housing. They also opened access to a stretch of the riverfront that had been closed for some two centuries. Writing in the New Statesman, the architecture critic Jules Lubbock commended the Coin Street Action Group for opening a new view across the river to St Paul's, the cathedral that had been the \"very symbol of the British people in the face of Nazism\" but which had since been \"shamefully mutilated\" by post-war developers. At that time Lubbock was among Prince Charles's architectural advisers, and a few weeks later, that same argument about St Paul's turned up in Prince Charles's Mansion House speech, in which the traditional look of St Paul's cathedral was used to redeclare the memory of the second world war against the peace that had followed it. Prince Charles chose to launch his revivalist \"Vision of Britain\" with the help of Turner's view of St Paul's, looking up the Thames from Greenwich, and also Canaletto's earlier downriver view from the terrace of Somerset House. By the time Charles and his advisers had finished with the dome of St Paul's, the whole question of the city and its future was lost in a barren argument about architectural styles, with modernism being bad and undue praise falling on classical revivalism. To look out from Oxo Tower Wharf now is to realise how far we've have come since that chaotic, largely ghost-written argument. St Paul's looks fine, and the architects have recovered too. The same cannot be said for the tradition of state-led social reform, which got written off as so many infernal council tower blocks. As for the \"public access\" that is now routinely demanded in riverside planning, that has already come to mean considerably more than the right to squeeze past private residential fortresses and their security systems. The south bank especially has become a new public amenity, which is already changing the feel of London: it's an energetically mixed-up place, where Londoners encounter one another in their flamboyant post-colonial diversity while tourists from more monocultural places boggle enviously at the result. Meanwhile, the river itself is becoming something more than just a moneyed view. Mark Rylance, the artistic director at the Globe Theatre, describes it as both sinister and inspiring, a brown deity that brings nature and myth into the midst of an over-controlled city. The London Rivers Association has also been working to intensify the meaning of the resurgent and successfully cleaned-up river, insisting that it should be seen as an \"ecological super-highway\" and \"reservoir of memory\", and disconcerting some architects by describing it as a potential \"blue-belt\" and nature reserve. As ever, the money will look after itself. But Ken Livingstone is plainly the man to take the public aspect of the new river further. As the figure responsible for \"promoting the wellbeing of London and Londoners\", the new mayor doesn't have to confine his attention entirely to London's irksome transport problems. His real job is to be the patron of London's new public domain, and the river should be among his focal points. It can be assumed that Livingstone will do everything he can to establish that cosmopolitanism is one of the great qualities of London's people rather than just its most exotic cuisine. Since wandering about, whether in a spirit of curiosity or of mutual exhibitionism, is to play such a considerable part in new London life, he should preside over a general increase in public litter bins - early casualties of the IRA, who seem to have provided every cost-cutting bureaucrat in the country with the excuse to get rid of them. He might also encourage the return of herbaceous borders: traditional but labour-intensive features of municipal parks that were among the first victims of council job cuts in the 80s. If further measures are needed to dispel any hint of smugness that may already be arising in this perfect new metropolitan world, Livingstone might consider reviving an ancient river custom that was unaccountably missing from the watery scenes of Shakespeare in Love. In the days when watermen propelled wherries and other such floating taxis up and down the London river, their passengers used to enjoy hurling insults at one another. Samuel Johnson was proud of the killer line with which he put an end to one such virtuoso contest: \"Sir, your wife, under pretence of keeping a bawdy house, is a receiver of stolen goods.\" That particular example would only cause perplexity if called out from the wind-buffeted Millennium Bridge today, but more appropriate versions would surely be forthcoming with a little encouragement.

The details of Mr Robinson's retirement stipend were carried in the shares prospectus for the newly merged group. Under the merger's terms share options granted to all Granada directors will turn into cash when the deal goes through. Charles Allen, the 43-year-old Granada chief executive, will see his options realised with a value of around \u00a38.1m. The Granada-Compass deal has been agreed ahead of the demerger of Granada's media business later this year into a separately quoted company. Mr Robsinon, who is 51, will continue to receive his \u00a31m a year salary from the hospitality rump group until his retirement at 55. A company insider said it was difficult to say how many days a week he might be working as a consultant. \"It's not about how long you spend at the crease, it is about how many runs you score,\" he said. The re-engineering has been driven by Granada's ambition to play a part in the forthcoming tussle for control of ITV, and gives the media division clearer currency in the form of separately listed shares. Directors joining the media division will be expected to buy shares in the business as a demonstration of their commitment to the company. They will reinvest between 100% and 300% of their basic salary. Sources close to the group said Mr Allen would plough a large part of money made on his options back into the separately listed media business. Further free shares and options matching the individual's investment in the new company will be granted at the discretion of the remuneration committee. Granada directors joining the media business will be given two-year contracts. The \u00a317.5bn agreement announced last month initially met with a hostile reception from the City but shares in both firms have crept back up. Compass directors will not see their options packages realised but instead converted to Granada-Compass shares. Compass directors, how ever, will also be awarded an unspecified amount of free shares and options as part of the deal. A spokesman for the two firms said: \"Both Compass and Granada are setting up share commitment plans that are appropriate to their business environments. \"The message to shareholders is clear. Executives are aligning their interests with the future success of Compass-Granada Hospitality and Granada Media.\" Around 20% of Granada Media will be floated on the stock market by the middle of next month, placing a value on the company of between \u00a36bn and \u00a37bn. Mr Allen will be executive chair of Granada Media while the Compass boss, Francis Mackay, will run the hospitality company. The deal satisfied the ambitions of Mr Robinson, who had long suggested that he hoped to do one more significant deal before retiring. Granada was caught flatfooted by plans of its two rival ITV groups, United News &amp; Media and Carlton Communications, to merge and has said it is minded to bid for one or the other. The competition commission is expected to make its submission to the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, some time later this week. The share prospectus also disclosed that the deal has earned the investment bank, Lazards, around \u00a355m.",

It's not something that I've done lightly, but it's just been made impossible for me to let alone be on the same stage, but be in the same room as him.\" Noel is to rejoin the band for their British shows next month, but performed solo numbers during the Radio 1 broadcast from Eindhoven. \"It's been virtually impossible for me to tour at the moment because he's been a bit of an idiot,\" he said. \"I'll be doing the British dates and then we've all got to have a chat, but at the moment he's losing it.\"",

Mark Thompson, who was appointed earlier this year as director of television by Mr Dyke, the BBC's director general, risked accusations of \"dumbing down\" by saying that the corporation had to reinvent itself to survive the digital television age. The presnt \"mixed schedule\" channels such as BBC1 and BBC2 should be transformed into \"genre-based\" networks, and a review was already under way. \"There can be no sacred cows,\" said Mr Thompson.

The plan, which is supported by presenters Peter Sissons and Michael Burke, and by the BBC1 controller Peter Salmon, would free the peak time schedule for popular entertainment and drama - a key battleground in the audience war with ITV. BBC2 has promoted \"theme nights\" such as the History Zone which have proved popular with viewers. Such moves are a response to research which shows that in digital satellite homes, ratings for the traditional channels are plummeting. Electronic programme guides enable viewers to seek out easily the programmes they want to watch among the plethora of available channels, and channel loyalty has all but disappeared. Many at the BBC believe that by creating genre-based channels instead of the mixed schedules of BBC1 and BBC2, viewers will know where to come for the kinds of programmes they enjoy.

The packs are estimated to kill 21,000-25,000 foxes a year.</p> <p>There are three registered staghound packs in the Devon and Somerset area [which] kill about 160 red deer a year in total ... 15% of the number required to be culled to maintain a stable population.</p> <p>There are about 100 registered packs of hounds which hunt hares. They kill about 1,650 hares a season, a very small percentage of the number killed by shooting.</p> <p>There are some 24 registered hare coursing clubs which kill about 250 hares a year; the 20 minkhound packs kill somewhere between 400-1,400 mink a season, considerably less than are killed by trapping and shooting.</p> <p><b> Hunting and the rural economy</b></p> <p>Hunting needs to be seen in a wider economic and social context. There is a complex set of relationships and economic activities that serve hunting or are dependent on it.</p> <p><b> Jobs</b></p> <p>We estimate that 6,000-8,000 full-time jobs depend on hunting, although the number of people involved may be significantly higher. About 700 jobs result from direct employment by hunts. Between 1,500-3,000 full-time equivalent jobs (involving 2,500-5,000 people) result from employment on hunting-related activities.</p> <p>It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of jobs which would be lost. In terms of national employment statistics the short term loss would be limited. In the medium term, three-five years, losses would arise in the wider rural economy, particularly the horse economy. In the long term, seven-10 years, most effects would be offset as the rural economy adjusted.</p> <p>Some of those affected have specialised skills and they would find it hard to find alternative employment. For a small number of local communities the effects could be more serious.</p> <p><b> Social and cultural aspects</b></p> <p>For a significant minority, notably hunt participants and farmers in more isolated rural communities, the hunt plays a dominant role.</p> <p>Even those who do not feel greatly the loss of the hunt's social activities consider that it would have a detrimental effect on community in general. A number feel it would mean the end of an important living, cultural tradition.</p> <p>It is clear that, especially in isolated communities, hunting acts as a significant cohesive force. Farmers and landowners ... would resent what they would see as an unnecessary and ill-informed interference.</p> <p>For another group the hunt itself seems divisive, intrusive and disruptive.</p> <p><b> Population management and control</b></p> <p>Foxes: Landowners and gamekeepers consider it necessary to manage fox populations in view of the damage to farming and game management.</p> <p>Methods involving guns probably account for the greater part of foxes killed. In lowland areas hunting makes only a minor contribution ... terrier work may be more important. In upland areas there are fewer alternatives to the use of dogs.</p> <p>Deer: There are 4,000-6,000 red deer in Devon and Somerset ... 1,000 need to be culled annually for a stable population.</p> <p>Hares: There are about 630,000 brown hares in England and Wales. About 1,650 are killed by packs. Hare hunting and coursing are essentially carried out for recreational purposes and have a small direct impact on numbers.</p> <p>Mink: There are an estimated 18,000 mink in England and Wales. Because of fecundicity and high level of dispersal hunting does not have any significant effect on the mink population.</p> <p><b> Animal welfare</b></p> <p>The issues of cruelty and animal welfare are central to the debate about hunting. Animal welfare is concerned with assessing the ability of an animal to cope with its environment. This judgment is distinct from any ethical or moral judgments.</p> <p>Deer: Most scientists agree that deer are likely to suffer in the final stages of hunting. The available evidence does not enable us to resolve at what point in the hunt the welfare of the deer becomes seriously compromised. Stalking ... is in principle the better method of culling deer from an animal welfare perspective.</p> <p>Foxes: There are three main aspects of foxhunting that effect welfare: the chase; the kill by hounds above ground; and digging out /terrier work.</p> <p>In the case of killing, death is not always effected by a single bite to the neck by the lead hound. In a proportion of cases it results from massive injuries to the chest and vital organs. There is a lack of firm scientific evidence on the welfare of a fox pursued, caught and killed above ground by hounds. We are satisfied that this experience seriously compromises the welfare of the fox.</p> <p>We are satisifed that the activity of digging out and shooting a fox involves a serious compromise of its welfare.</p> <p><b> Drag and bloodhound hunting</b></p> <p>It is unlikely that drag and bloodhound hunting or drag coursing would mitigate any adverse effects on the rural economy or the social life of the countryside arising from a ban on hunting.</p> <p><b> Practical aspects of hunting: the concerns</b></p> <p>Trespass: There are too many cases of trespass, disruption and disturbance [that] can cause distress.</p> <p>Openness: In the absence of a ban, organised hunting should be conducted on a more open basis than at present. One option would be the appointment of individuals as independent monitors who would have the freedom to take photographs and video evidence.</p> <p>Digging out/terrier work: In the absence of a ban serious consideration could be given as to whether this practice should be allowed to continue.</p> <p>Artificial earths: In the absence of a ban hunts could be required or encouraged to end this practice.</p> <p><b> Implementing a ban</b></p> <p>Legislation to ban hunting might be open to challenge under article 1 of Protocol (property rights) and article 8 (respect for private life) of the European convention on human rights. An important point would be whether legislators could point to unnecessary suffering or some other point beyond mere disapproval.</p> <p>Unless there was a good reason on objective grounds, we do not think it would be satisfactory to have different legislative provisions in different regions.</p> <p>It would be possible to implement a ban quickly. There are stronger arguments for allowing a reasonable period of adjustment. This would enable more time ... to mitigate social and economic consequences.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.huntinginquiry.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\"> Burns inquiry homepage</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.countryside-alliance.net\" target=\"_NEW\"> Countryside Alliance</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.league.uk.com\" target=\"_NEW\">League Against Cruel Sports</a></p>",

Jobs We estimate that 6,000-8,000 full-time jobs depend on hunting, although the number of people involved may be significantly higher. About 700 jobs result from direct employment by hunts. Between 1,500-3,000 full-time equivalent jobs (involving 2,500-5,000 people) result from employment on hunting-related activities. It is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of jobs which would be lost. In terms of national employment statistics the short term loss would be limited. In the medium term, three-five years, losses would arise in the wider rural economy, particularly the horse economy. In the long term, seven-10 years, most effects would be offset as the rural economy adjusted. Some of those affected have specialised skills and they would find it hard to find alternative employment. For a small number of local communities the effects could be more serious. Social and cultural aspects For a significant minority, notably hunt participants and farmers in more isolated rural communities, the hunt plays a dominant role. Even those who do not feel greatly the loss of the hunt's social activities consider that it would have a detrimental effect on community in general. A number feel it would mean the end of an important living, cultural tradition. It is clear that, especially in isolated communities, hunting acts as a significant cohesive force. Farmers and landowners ... would resent what they would see as an unnecessary and ill-informed interference. For another group the hunt itself seems divisive, intrusive and disruptive. Population management and control Foxes: Landowners and gamekeepers consider it necessary to manage fox populations in view of the damage to farming and game management. Methods involving guns probably account for the greater part of foxes killed. In lowland areas hunting makes only a minor contribution ... terrier work may be more important. In upland areas there are fewer alternatives to the use of dogs. Deer: There are 4,000-6,000 red deer in Devon and Somerset ... 1,000 need to be culled annually for a stable population. Hares: There are about 630,000 brown hares in England and Wales. About 1,650 are killed by packs. Hare hunting and coursing are essentially carried out for recreational purposes and have a small direct impact on numbers. Mink: There are an estimated 18,000 mink in England and Wales. Because of fecundicity and high level of dispersal hunting does not have any significant effect on the mink population. Animal welfare The issues of cruelty and animal welfare are central to the debate about hunting. Animal welfare is concerned with assessing the ability of an animal to cope with its environment. This judgment is distinct from any ethical or moral judgments. Deer: Most scientists agree that deer are likely to suffer in the final stages of hunting. The available evidence does not enable us to resolve at what point in the hunt the welfare of the deer becomes seriously compromised. Stalking ... is in principle the better method of culling deer from an animal welfare perspective. Foxes: There are three main aspects of foxhunting that effect welfare: the chase; the kill by hounds above ground; and digging out /terrier work. In the case of killing, death is not always effected by a single bite to the neck by the lead hound. In a proportion of cases it results from massive injuries to the chest and vital organs. There is a lack of firm scientific evidence on the welfare of a fox pursued, caught and killed above ground by hounds. We are satisfied that this experience seriously compromises the welfare of the fox. We are satisifed that the activity of digging out and shooting a fox involves a serious compromise of its welfare. Drag and bloodhound hunting It is unlikely that drag and bloodhound hunting or drag coursing would mitigate any adverse effects on the rural economy or the social life of the countryside arising from a ban on hunting. Practical aspects of hunting: the concerns Trespass: There are too many cases of trespass, disruption and disturbance [that] can cause distress. Openness: In the absence of a ban, organised hunting should be conducted on a more open basis than at present. One option would be the appointment of individuals as independent monitors who would have the freedom to take photographs and video evidence. Digging out/terrier work: In the absence of a ban serious consideration could be given as to whether this practice should be allowed to continue. Artificial earths: In the absence of a ban hunts could be required or encouraged to end this practice. Implementing a ban Legislation to ban hunting might be open to challenge under article 1 of Protocol (property rights) and article 8 (respect for private life) of the European convention on human rights. An important point would be whether legislators could point to unnecessary suffering or some other point beyond mere disapproval. Unless there was a good reason on objective grounds, we do not think it would be satisfactory to have different legislative provisions in different regions. It would be possible to implement a ban quickly. There are stronger arguments for allowing a reasonable period of adjustment. This would enable more time ... to mitigate social and economic consequences. Useful links Burns inquiry homepage Countryside Alliance League Against Cruel Sports",

      "bodyText": "The first signs of a power struggle in Syria emerged yesterday when the late president's disgraced brother challenged the succession to power of his 34-year-old nephew, Bashar al-Assad. Rifaat al-Assad, who in 1983 attempted a coup d'etat , threatened to return from exile in France to Damascus \"at the appropriate time\". He claims that his dismissal as vice-president in 1998 was \"an illegal act\" and that he - rather than Bashar - should have succeeded to power. \"What is happening in Syria is a real farce and an unconstitutional piece of theatre which is a real violation of the law and the constitution,\" Rifaat said through his spokesman in Marbella, Spain. The spokesman, al-Hareth al-Khair, added: \"Rifaat Assad is a leader of the Syrian people, [he] loves his people as his people love him. He will go to his people and take up his responsibilities to fulfil the will of the people. \"He represents legitimacy in Syria,\" Mr Khair said, adding that Rifaat is therefore capable of removing the restrictions against him \"through the force of legitimacy, the people and the army who are with him\". He added: \"Dr Rifaat stresses peaceful action and refraining from spilling blood and does not want Syria to drown in blood. But he believes that legitimacy will prevail in a rightful way.\" The Syrian military, however, appears to have rallied around Bashar. The pan-Arab newspaper, al-Hayat, yesterday quoted a senior official as saying orders had been issued to arrest Rifaat if he tried to attend his brother's funeral. The army and the security services were granted \"full powers to carry out anything to stop him from entering the country\", the official said. Security has been stepped up at Beirut airport and at Lebanese seaports; security officials there said Syrian agents were on the lookout for Rifaat in case he tried to sneak home through the porous Lebanese border. Commenting on the threat of arrest, Rifaat's spokesman said: \"This is natural to come from a leadership that has no confidence in itself. We expect more.\" After his sacking as vice-president, Rifaat, 63, took refuge in France, where surveillance has been sharply stepped up, according to French secret service sources. Rifaat has been told formally that he will be expelled from the country if he starts moves to return to Damascus and challenge Bashar. \"If he is told to leave the country, he will probably seek refuge in London where his son, Soumar, runs the television station, ANN, which is linked with studios in Paris,\" an agent in the surveillance team said. The decision by the French president, Jacques Chirac, to attend Hafez's funeral as the only western head of state was seen by diplomats here as proof that France was committed to Bashar's succession as part of a long-running attempt to re-establish French influence in the Middle East. Mr Chirac's preference for a Syrian successor was signalled in November when he publicly shook hands with Bashar on the steps of the French presidential palace, a gesture which angered Rifaat. France's sudden chill treatment of Rifaat is in strong contrast to the welcome he received when he quit Syria in August 1998 and was considered as a potential successor as head of state. With a fortune estimated at between $2bn and $4bn (\u00a31.33bn-\u00a32.7bn), he has allegedly helped many French politicians with their election funds and received favoured treatment in return. Permanently escorted by about 30 bodyguards, he continues to manage at least 100 companies and control funds salted away in Panama and other tax havens. He is also allowed to publish two daily papers and to attend official receptions on a quasi-diplomatic level. An Arab diplomat said he was not sure that France had ruled out Rifaat's succession altogether and he would maintain some privileges, including official protection, until the changeover became more clear. \"Bashar is faced with one overwhelming question: Can he last?\" the official said. \"Rifaat might have everything to gain from a policy of wait-and-see.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain last night continued to side with the US and Canada in their long-running trade war with the EU over the 12-year-old Europe-wide ban on the use of hormones in beef. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, said there was no scientific justification for the ban, which also applies to imports and last year prompted tit-for-tat action, involving punitive 100% US tariffs, on selected goods from all EU countries except Britain. The goods included French cheese and truffles, French and German mustard and chocolate and soups. The tariffs were designed to make up for trade losses totalling nearly $117m (\u00a373m). There is no question of Britain opting out of the EU ban but its continuing support for the US position means it is unlikely to face any retaliation for the foreseeable future. Scientists working for the European commission have reaffirmed their view that the use of hormones in speeding up the growth of cattle and in treating their diseases does pose a threat to human health, particularly to children who have yet to reach puberty. Po tential risks include encouraging cancers and undermining the body's immune systems, they warn. The scientists were compelled to provide new evidence by the World Trade Organisation, which said the ban had been imposed without proper risk assessments. The commission now proposes a continuing ban on six hormones to maintain a \"high level of protection of public health\" but says it will keep the position under \"regular review\". However, government advisers on the veterinary products committee continue to dispute the verdict of their EC colleagues, who include two Britons, Richard Gilbert, the former deputy director of the public health laboratory service, and Mac Johnston, of London University's department of farm animal and equine medicine and surgery. Mr Brown said: \"Unless new scientific evidence is made available for a full evaluation by independent UK experts, the position of the government is unchanged.

      "bodyText": "The United States may be the world's only superpower, and its values may be sweeping many of the world's cultural and economic borders aside, but Washington is once again preparing to mount a rearguard action against moves to establish an International Criminal Court which would try the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Yesterday, as the latest session of the preparatory commission for the International Criminal Court (ICC) got under way in New York, the US delegation put forward new proposals to ensure that citizens of countries which have refused to sign the treaty establishing the court - of which the US is the most prominent - should not be covered by its jurisdiction. The United States is one of seven nations which have not signed the ICC treaty, which was drafted in Rome in 1998. Others include China and Iraq. The court will come into existence when 60 nations have ratified the treaty. So far, 12 have done so, though 97 have signed the treaty and are committed to ratification in due course. The official US position is that it is opposed to any court that might possibly seek to put US soldiers and officials on trial under an international jurisdiction. This is a highly sensitive issue for the Pentagon and for a nation which has always been reluctant to allow its domestic law to be overridden by international agreements of any kind. Washington says that the dispute is a crucial sovereignty issue. But there is increasing evidence that the US position is being formulated in response to domestic party political considerations as much as to principles of international law. Republican leaders in Congress have chosen this week to turn up the heat on the issue, a move which is widely seen as an attempt to prevent any compromise on the issue by the Clinton administration. The Senate foreign relations committee, whose chairman Senator Jesse Helms has already said that any treaty to establish the court would be \"dead on arrival\" if submitted to his committee, has summoned several opponents of the court to give evidence on Capitol Hill tomorrow. Witnesses include the former defence secretary Caspar Weinberger and the conservative jurist Jeremy Rabkin. In the absence of any great enthusiasm for the treaty on the part of the Democrats, especially in election year, it is becoming increasingly probable that the court will come into existence without the participation of a nation which has repeatedly been in the forefront of international calls for leaders such as Pol Pot or Saddam Hussein to be put on trial for crimes against humanity. The ICC is currently on course to come into existence in 2002, with jurisdiction to bring prosecutions of perpe trators of crimes such as genocide and torture. The current session of the preparatory commission for the ICC opened in New York yesterday and is focusing on rules of procedure and evidence. The session, the fifth in a process set up under the Rome treaty, is expected to continue for the rest of this month, with a sixth session scheduled for the autumn. The latest nation to ratify the treaty is France, which did so last week. Britain is a signatory to the 1998 treaty but has not yet ratified it. France's decision was \"a clear signal to the United States that major nations and allies are continuing to progress towards completing the ratification, and they are not willing to reopen the treaty,\" said William Pace, the convenor of the US-based Coalition for an International Criminal Court, an umbrella group of pro-treaty bodies. The latest US attempt to change the terms of the treaty was an \"ill-timed and misguided effort,\" Mr Pace said. Supporters of the treaty are suspicious of the timing of the latest moves, not least because the court gives countries whose citizens are charged with international crimes the right to have their cases tried in their own home country. \"Why they seem to be driving this thing over the edge to get something they don't need is an intriguing question,\" said Richard Dicker of Human Rights Watch. \"The treaty has more than enough assurances to meet their concerns.\"",

Ministers have accepted that the difficulties of balancing work and home life are as great or greater once children go to school, and so will widen the application of proposed new rights, such as an entitlement to work part-time, to parents of pre-school and school-age youngsters. The decision, made at the first meeting of a ministerial review group on maternity rights and flexible working, will be warmly welcomed by campaigners for a better deal for working parents. However, the extension is certain to anger business, which already argues that government regulation increasing workers' rights is excessive and burdensome. If the review opts to take a tough line and enshrine new rights in legislation, firms could be forced to allow all mothers of school age and pre-school children to switch to part-time working. Companies are unlikely to be appeased by government pledges to make a powerful business case for more workplace flexibility. The review group, which is chaired by the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, and includes women's ministers Lady Jay and Tessa Jowell and equal opportunities minister Margaret Hodge, is charged with finding ways to help parents, particularly women, to combine work and family life. So far, the government has launched a work-life balance campaign to urge companies to introduce flexible work policies, but is relying on coercion rather than legislation. Ministers have already privately indicated that the right to return to a job part-time after having a baby is being considered as a manifesto proposal for Labour's second term. However, the review group's implications now go even further by dramatically increasing the proportion of parents affected. The group, which is due to report in the autumn, will decide whether to make the option of returning to work part-time or on a flexible basis - perhaps including home working - a legal right, or whether to offer weaker options such as a strong presumption of flexible working unless a company can prove it would be difficult to offer it. Alternatively, companies could be offered incentives to introduce better family-friendly policies. A primary reason for change, ministers believe, is that women at present leave work altogether after having children, or go back too soon because of inadequate maternity pay and then swiftly leave their jobs anyway. However, campaigners for new family-friendly rights are wary of the move to apply any changes to a wider group of parents. The former social security secretary Harriet Harman, campaigning from the backbenches on family policy, said: \"What would be totally unacceptable would be to do too little to improve maternity pay and leave, which were the initial focus of this review. \"The government must also be wary of talking up issues such as family-friendly working and then failing to back that up with legislation.\" She added: \"Working groups, accreditation schemes and management handbooks will make absolutely no difference for the vast majority of Britain's women.\"",

      "body": "<p>Commonplace hospital and dental operations could become too medically risky because of the rapid march of superbugs resistant to antibiotics, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.</p> <p>It warned of the \"almost unimaginable repercussions\" of a failure to curb the misuse of drugs that threatened procedures such as hip replacements and cyst removals because infection controls were proving so inadequate.</p> <p>The WHO's report points to the danger that increasing drug resistance among infectious bacteria posed to programmes to reduce the victims of killer diseases, such as pneumonia, TB, malaria and Aids. The report calls on governments and drug companies to devise new ways of curbing overuse in industrialised countries and of encouraging \"wider but wiser\" prescriptions in developing countries.</p> <p>The report's publication coincided with the government's announcement of a new action plan for Britain.</p> <p>This takes in new checks on hospital procedures to prevent cross-infection; fresh guidelines on drugs, dosage and duration of treatments to stop routine overuse of medicines; public education programmes to reduce patients' demands for antibiotics; and monitoring of use of antibiotics in humans, pets and livestock.</p> <p>In UK hospitals, resistance to penicillin treatments for the staphylococcus infection, whose symptoms include severe vomiting and abdominal pain - potentially disastrous among patients whose immune systems are already compromised - now occurs among about a third of cases. Resistance to an alternative antibiotic, methicillin, is nearing similar levels in England and Wales.</p> <p>About 50m prescriptions for antibiotics are handed out by GPs in England alone and many of those are given for complaints such as viral sore throats, for which they are not appropriate.</p> <p>The report was published as the WHO warned that a small but growing number of patients was already developing resistance to the anti-HIV drug AZT, and that penicillin had become \"virtually useless\" for treating the venereal disase gonorrhoea. Further, strains of TB resistant to a whole range of drugs, which had emerged in eastern Europe, Asia and Africa, were now reappearing in patients in western Europe and north America. Resistance to the old first treatment of choice for malaria, chloroquine , was widespread in most countries where the disase was still a major killer.</p> <p>In the US alone, some 14,000 people were infected and died each year from drug-resistant microbes being picked up in hospitals. But some problems in the developing world were caused by underuse not overuse, with many governments being unable to afford programmes which allowed patients to follow complete courses of antibiotics. The use of counterfeit drugs was making matters worse.</p> <p>The WHO report criticised the way some drug companies rewarded poorly paid health workers in developing countries with commissions that effectively encouraged them to avoid treatments aimed at specific complaints in favour of broad-spectrum antibiotics that had wide applications.</p> <p>The WHO is in talks with drug companies and governments over introduction of incentives to develop a new generation of drugs, including tax breaks, extension of patents, and fast-track approvals for some new treatments.</p> <p>It is also expected that the G8 summit of industrialised nations in Japan next month will announce new funds to boost research into AIDS, malaria, acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases and TB.</p> <p>At the moment, treatments for these afflictions only account for 2% of global research and development health budgets.</p> <p>David Heymann, executive director of the WHO's programme on communicable diseases, said: \"We are in a race against time to bring levels of infectious disease down worldwide before the diseases wear the drugs down first.\"</p> <p>Rosamund Williams, who heads the WHO team on drug resistance, said that the organisation and governments were asking pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs \"because the pipeline is running dry ... but we don't want them to overpromote them and oversell them.</p> <p>\"It is a challenge. How do we provide the incentives that are necessary so that the profits do not have to be recouped through sales?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Commonplace hospital and dental operations could become too medically risky because of the rapid march of superbugs resistant to antibiotics, the World Health Organisation said yesterday. It warned of the \"almost unimaginable repercussions\" of a failure to curb the misuse of drugs that threatened procedures such as hip replacements and cyst removals because infection controls were proving so inadequate. The WHO's report points to the danger that increasing drug resistance among infectious bacteria posed to programmes to reduce the victims of killer diseases, such as pneumonia, TB, malaria and Aids. The report calls on governments and drug companies to devise new ways of curbing overuse in industrialised countries and of encouraging \"wider but wiser\" prescriptions in developing countries. The report's publication coincided with the government's announcement of a new action plan for Britain. This takes in new checks on hospital procedures to prevent cross-infection; fresh guidelines on drugs, dosage and duration of treatments to stop routine overuse of medicines; public education programmes to reduce patients' demands for antibiotics; and monitoring of use of antibiotics in humans, pets and livestock. In UK hospitals, resistance to penicillin treatments for the staphylococcus infection, whose symptoms include severe vomiting and abdominal pain - potentially disastrous among patients whose immune systems are already compromised - now occurs among about a third of cases. Resistance to an alternative antibiotic, methicillin, is nearing similar levels in England and Wales. About 50m prescriptions for antibiotics are handed out by GPs in England alone and many of those are given for complaints such as viral sore throats, for which they are not appropriate. The report was published as the WHO warned that a small but growing number of patients was already developing resistance to the anti-HIV drug AZT, and that penicillin had become \"virtually useless\" for treating the venereal disase gonorrhoea. Further, strains of TB resistant to a whole range of drugs, which had emerged in eastern Europe, Asia and Africa, were now reappearing in patients in western Europe and north America. Resistance to the old first treatment of choice for malaria, chloroquine , was widespread in most countries where the disase was still a major killer. In the US alone, some 14,000 people were infected and died each year from drug-resistant microbes being picked up in hospitals. But some problems in the developing world were caused by underuse not overuse, with many governments being unable to afford programmes which allowed patients to follow complete courses of antibiotics. The use of counterfeit drugs was making matters worse. The WHO report criticised the way some drug companies rewarded poorly paid health workers in developing countries with commissions that effectively encouraged them to avoid treatments aimed at specific complaints in favour of broad-spectrum antibiotics that had wide applications. The WHO is in talks with drug companies and governments over introduction of incentives to develop a new generation of drugs, including tax breaks, extension of patents, and fast-track approvals for some new treatments. It is also expected that the G8 summit of industrialised nations in Japan next month will announce new funds to boost research into AIDS, malaria, acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases and TB. At the moment, treatments for these afflictions only account for 2% of global research and development health budgets. David Heymann, executive director of the WHO's programme on communicable diseases, said: \"We are in a race against time to bring levels of infectious disease down worldwide before the diseases wear the drugs down first.\" Rosamund Williams, who heads the WHO team on drug resistance, said that the organisation and governments were asking pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs \"because the pipeline is running dry ... but we don't want them to overpromote them and oversell them. \"It is a challenge. How do we provide the incentives that are necessary so that the profits do not have to be recouped through sales?\"",

      "bodyText": "In a report headed Time for truly ethical policies, page 10, yesterday, we said that both Russia and the US were members of the OSCE, the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe. We meant to say that Russia is a member but the US is not. In a report on page 8 yesterday about the decision of the management of the Millennium Dome to decline to show a wax sculpture of Che Guevara we described \"BAe/Marconi\", the sponsors of the Mind zone, as \"the UK's largest manufacturer of military hardware\". We then quoted the artist responsible for the work as saying, \"They thought it would not go down well with Marconi as they make missiles.\" Marconi is a telecommunications company and does not make missiles. It has not made arms since November of last year, before the dome opened, when that part of its activities went to BAe Systems. The Newcomen Society, mentioned in our survey of famous bridges, Spanning the centuries, page 11, June 10, exists for the study of the history of engineering and technology and is, \"emphatically\", the present president of the society says, not \"dedicated to civil engineering and industrial archaeology\". The society is interested in the history of all kinds of engineering. There is a quite separate Association for Industrial Archaeology. In the map on the same page we switched the positions of Westminster and Waterloo bridges. The photograph on page 1, June 10, captioned, \"An Israeli soldier on lookout during the six-day war\" actually related to an event several months after the war.

The drive to Mixco takes you past a ramshackle shanty-town that encapsulates the poverty of the country, where the richest 10% of the population have 70 times the annual incomes of the poorest 10%.</p> <p>Four years ago, Ms de Leon, now 26, was pregnant with her third child. Her husband told her the family could not afford another baby and he did not want to go into debt. An abortion was suggested. When she refused, she recounted over lunch at Campero, the local equivalent of Kentucky Fried Chicken, another plan was put into operation. The child would be sold for adoption to the US for 4,000 quetzales (about \u00a3360), and in doing so would become one of the growing number of babies who have helped to make this Central American country of 11m people the fourth largest provider of children for adoption after Russia, China and South Korea.</p> <p>\"He had never been violent before but he threatened to kill the children if I did not agree,\" said Ms de Leon. \"We went to see a lawyer and I was told just to listen and not to talk. He was very aggressive. I was very nervous with all the pressure.\"</p> <p>With the cooperation of her husband's family, she was moved out of the city and into a house in a nearby town where she was kept in seclusion until just before the baby was due. She was taken to a gynaecologist who gave her a stronger anaesthetic than she had had for her first two children. When she came round, she said, the baby was gone. This was December 3, 1996. It was not until December 23 1998 that they were reunited.</p> <p>With the help of several organisations and lawyers, Ms de Leon and her mother fought to find the child and have her returned. Ms de Leon's husband, from whom she is now separated, argued that she had willingly consented to the adoption and had only later changed her mind.</p> <p>After two years of legal action, she won custody of the child, Melissa. \"She was afraid of me at first,\" she said. \"She had never left the house before and she started to cry.\"</p> <p>In a cafe in Zone One of Guatemala City, an area so crime-ridden that security guards with shotguns and pistols seem to hover on every street corner, Gustavo Tobar sits with a folder of papers. They contain the address in the east of the US where his son is now living with adoptive American parents. He, too, said the child was taken against his will and for money.</p> <p>Mr Tobar said his son and stepchild were both taken into an institution after a neighbour who looked after them had claimed they were being maltreated. He later discovered that the neighbour had links with a lawyer who assisted in the adoption process. He and his former partner are fighting to regain the children by proving that the adoption was illegal. He believes he has a good chance of success.</p> <p>\"I would love to talk to the children but I am afraid that if I make contact, they [adoptive parents] would move,\" he said.</p> <p>Last month, the UN published a report on the sale of children by a special rapporteur, Ofelia Calcetas-Santos. It concluded that legal adoption appears to be the exception rather than the rule in Guatemala. \"Since huge profits can be made, the child has become an object of commerce rather than the focus of the law.\"</p> <p>Ms Calcetas-Santos suggested that \"trafficking of babies and young children for inter-country adoption exists on a large scale. The system lends itself to the nefarious practice of reducing children to commercial objects to be offered to the highest bidders.\"</p> <p>The report claimed there are casas de engordeza - \"fattening houses\" - where babies are kept while the adoption process goes through and suggested that falsification of documentation was common.</p> <p>This message is simple and shocking. However, the sweeping nature of the UN report has been attacked and Ms Calcetas-Santos herself admits it had to be researched in great haste. Under the surface the story becomes much more complex. It has to do with with the relationship between rich and poor countries, national sentiment and xenophobia, the power of the church, cross-cultural adoption and the ideology of child-rearing. It is a debate that crosses political lines and creates odd allies as two sides, both inside Guatemala and in the countries where adopted Guatemalan children live, fight to have their side told.</p> <p>The first time that Guatemalan children were adopted by foreigners in substantial numbers was in the early 1980s at the height of the 36-year civil war when thousands of children had been orphaned and displaced as the military carried out a scorched earth policy of wiping out the Mayan villages which had harboured leftwing guerrillas. In 1996, the year of the peace agreement that has brought a degree of normalcy to the country, there were 731 international adoptions. By 1999, the figure had more than doubled to 1,645 and there are likely to be 2,000 this year, according to Unicef.</p> <p>In contrast, the total of international adoptions in all other Latin American countries combined now runs at fewer than 100 annually.</p> <p><b> Business is booming</b><br></p> <p>The reasons for the increase are many but with the acceptance within North America and Europe of abortion, the decreased stigma of single motherhood and the increase in infertility, would-be adoptive parents started looking abroad. Countries such as Peru, Bolivia and Honduras which used to allow international adoptions have all made it much harder, hence the drift to Guatemala where the Roman Catholic church still campaigns vigorously against contraception.</p> <p>International adoptions in Guatemala are almost all \"privatised\", which is to say that they are not organised through the government but by foreign adoption agencies dealing with Guatemalan lawyers. Would-be parents, who are mainly from the US but include a number from Britain and elsewhere in Europe, have to be approved by their own social services in the same way as if they were adopting locally.</p> <p>The total cost of adoption to a would-be parent ranges from around $12,000 (\u00a38,000) to $30,000. Of this, the agency might take a fee of around $3,000, the Guatemalan lawyers between $10,000 and $15,000 and the mother will receive, in some cases, \"expenses\" of between $500 and $1,000.</p> <p>The stories of malpractice have already led embassies including those of the US - where 62% of the adoptions take place - Britain and Canada to introduce DNA tests to ensure that the woman signing over the child is the real mother. The British embassy which oversees a much smaller, albeit increasing, number of cases said there have as yet been no failures of the DNA tests. Frank Neville, the press attache at the US embassy, said that from November 1998 to March 2000 there had been 15 cases out of around 2,500 adoption procedures where the children were shown by DNA tests not to be those of the supposed mother.</p> <p>Casa Alianza, an organisation that rehabilitates street children and has also taken up the cases of parents seeking the return of adopted children, say that they know of at least 27 cases where a child has been taken for adoption against the parent's will. The Casa Alianza lawyer dealing with cases of alleged abduction for adoption, Amalia Eraso, said: \"The most common situation is where the mother is pressured by her husband or a lawyer to give up a child for the money.\"</p> <p>Elizabeth Gibbons of Unicef believes that such cases are not isolated. Unicef will be bringing out its own report later this year which she indicated will show that there are many abuses of the process. One of the anomalies, she said, was that there are around 20,000 abandoned or orphaned children in orphanages who were not being adopted partly because the gov ernment process is lengthy and complex, and also because most adoptive parents seek babies rather than older children.</p> <p>\"The lawyers claim that mothers come to them but we believe that the lawyers go looking for them,\" said Ms Gibbons. She said that one lawyer had explained his fee of $6,000 in terms of the costs of nappies, vaccinations, nannies and milk, a rate vastly beyond the likely costs.</p> <p>\"We are concerned for the best interests of the child. At the moment, the adoptions are being carried out for the best interests of the lawyers and the adoptive parents.\"</p> <p>But Rachel Garst, a policy analyst and human rights advocate who has been living in Guatemala for more than 15 years and has two adopted Guatemalan children, believes the adopters' side of the story is rarely heard.</p> <p>\"There is a very sensationalist and disturbing debate going on here,\" said Ms Garst, who is from Iowa. \"People believe that gringos are just waltzing in to purchase children - who knows for what evil ends - and that hundreds of children are being stolen for adoption. All this has been inflamed by sensationalist press coverage.\"</p> <p>Ms Garst said the likely result was Guatemalan legislation that would obstruct or delay all international adoptions. \"If that happens, the real losers will be the children.\"</p> <p>The passion that permeates the adoption debate has had some extreme consequences. Here the story must take a detour to Todos Santos Cuchumatan, a village of 2,000 people 200 miles north west of the capital in the western highlands.</p> <p>Lying in a valley at the end of winding, unpaved road, Todos Santos has been a place on the backpackers' map for more than two decades. More recently, conventional tour parties have started to visit. The village is accustomed to foreigners; signs in English offer weaving lessons, local restaurants cater to vegetarians.</p> <p>Almost exactly a year ago, a 15-year-old girl was murdered in Huehuetenango, the nearby capital of the region. The girl's body, which had been mutilated and disembowelled, was left in the local cemetery. A rumour that she had been the victim of a foreign satanic sect circulated. At the end of last month, another rumour or bola (literally a ball) was rolling dangerously down the hills of the western highlands: a satanic sect was supposedly having a meeting in the area and was looking for local children to use in a sacrifice. Such was the strength of the rumour that schools closed throughout the area, including Todos Santos, on Friday 28 April.</p> <p>The following day, a tour party of 23 Japanese arrived in the village in a bus with darkened windows. They started to mingle in the square. One tourist, 40-year-old Tetsuo Yamahiro, patted a child on the head. A local woman screamed that she had seen a knife and that her child was being stolen. Hysteria spread through the crowd of around 500 and people attacked the tourists with stones and machetes. Yamahiro was killed.</p> <p>The bus driver, Edgar Castellanos, tried to escape and was attacked so violently that, according to Guido Galli, the local UN monitoring representative, his brains had spilled out of his head. Then he was doused in petrol and set on fire. Within 10 minutes the crowd's rage was spent and two dead bodies lay in the street. Nine people, including a local teacher, have been arrested and are being held in Huehuetenango.</p> <p>\"Have any children ever been stolen from here? No,\" said the village's mayor, Julian Mendoza. \"Have there ever been any satanic sects here? No. Have any children from here been taken from here for adoption abroad? No. We were waiting for Satan to arrive and he never did - but what happened? Satan rose up through us.\"</p> <p>Rachel Garst believes that what happened in Todos Santos is an extreme product of a debate that has become too anecdotal and rumour-fuelled; some rumours even suggest that children are kidnapped for their body parts. She is critical of the UN report for adding to the fears although it is not suggested in any way that it led to the lynchings. \"Trafficking,\" she believed, was a loaded term which referred merely to the fact that lawyers were charging high but perfectly legal fees.</p> <p><b> Abandoned children</b><br></p> <p>Martha Wallace, who runs an adoption agency in Pennsylvania and is the chair of the Guatemalan caucus of the Joint Council on International Children's Services (JCICS), is also critical of the UN report and described some of the conclusions as \"outrageous\". She said many of the claims made were anecdotal and without any statistical basis. The effect of stopping international adoption in other Latin American countries has meant that \"the orphanages are filled and more and more children are abandoned anonymously.\"</p> <p>In response to these criticisms, Ofelia Calcetas-Santos, the lawyer who compiled the UN report, said from her home in Manila that because of time and money constraints she had only been able to spend 10 working days in Guatemala for her research and that her task included investigating not only the sale of children but also child prostitution and pornography. She said that for this reason she could give no statistical evidence to back up her suggestion that legal adoptions were \"the exception rather than the rule.\" She said that \"many of the adoptions are legal under certain circumstances ... I am not trying to knock down adoptions if all things are observed.\"</p> <p>Adriana Portillo was the daughter and sister of guerrillas who were part of the Revolutionary Organisation of the People in Arms. On September 11, 1981 her two daughters, aged 10 and nine, were staying with her father in the 11th Zone of the Guatemalan capital when members of the military broke into the house and took the girls. She has not seen them since. She has since married and settled in Chicago but has returned to Guatemala once more in the search for her missing daughters by helping to set up the organisation Where Are the Children? In June, it will open its office, hoping that the reconciliation process might throw light on the fate of her girls and the countless others who have vanished and who could be long dead or adopted in Guatemala or abroad.</p> <p>\"I would ride the buses all over Guatemala City staring through the windows, just looking for them,\" said Adriana Portillo. \"I went to the orphanages and to the women's prisons asking if anyone had seen them. But we never found them. They were old enough to remember where they came from and I still think that they might have been adopted.\"</p> <p>Guatemala has changed since Adriana Portillo's children were seized but clearly mothers are still being forcibly separated from their children to profit from sale of babies for adoption. The sums that lawyers can make from adoptions may act for some as an incentive. Pressure is building on the authorities to impose a cap on legal fees to send a message that large profits should not be made from children.</p> <p>What no one, including the UN, yet knows is how widespread forced adoption really is. There are many good-hearted people involved on both sides of the debate. Both those who want to protect vulnerable mothers from exploitation, and those who want to take children out of grim institutions and put them into caring homes.</p>",

The shopaholic rocker was last night revealed as the centrepiece of a 900ft long frieze which wraps the entire Selfridges department store in central London. Sam Taylor-Wood's XV Seconds is a tongue-in-cheek take on the Elgin marbles frieze, with 21 pop cultural icons from actors to pop stars and supermodels adorning the temple of consumerism. Sir Elton was there to support Taylor-Wood, 33, who has recently received treatment for breast cancer. She said she conceived the work as a contemporary version of the Elgin marbles with modern day 'gods'. Nick Cross, of Selfridges, said they were \"chuffed\" with the work. \"We had to clean the building and this is brilliant way of covering an eyesore and doing something really interesting.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ethiopia and Eritrea appeared close to a ceasefire in their two-year war yesterday after Ethiopia agreed in principle to a peace plan that would put a UN military force along their disputed border. Eritrea, whose negotiating position was hit by recent battlefield losses, had already agreed to the peace plan so Ethiopia's acceptance could lead to a quick ceasefire in a war that has killed tens of thousands of soldiers. Eritrea, however, said it did not believe its southern neighbour was serious about peace and accused it of \"buying time\" to prepare new attacks. The peace proposal calls for both sides to withdraw to positions held before hostilities began in May 1998 and for a UN force to be deployed in a 12.5 mile buffer zone until international arbitrators demarcate their 600 mile border. The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) mediators said they expected a formal peace agreement would be signed at the end of this week but conceded that differences remain over the definition of the \"security zone\" and on the role of the UN military force. After Eritrea agreed to the peace plan on Friday, Ethiopia launched new attacks along the border, raising fears that it was intent on moving even deeper into Eritrea. On Sunday, it gave cautious backing to the peace plan mediated by the OAU. \"Ethiopia remains committed to ensuring a lasting and sustainable solution to the conflict and has agreed in principle to the proposals put forward in Algiers,\" the government said in a statement. It said a formal decision would be made by parliament and cabinet after consultations, but it was unclear when Ethiopia's parliament would consider the peace proposal. Fighting continued early yesterday around the western Eritrean town of Guluj but the rest of the border was quiet. The Eritrean presidential adviser Yemane Gebremesekel pointed to recent attacks near Eritrea's Red Sea port of Assab and around the town of Senafe on the central front as evidence that Ethiopia wanted to drive deeper into Eritrean territory.",

As such we have a responsibility to maintain the reputation and integrity of the market,\" they said. </p> <p>They added they had noted recent statements attributed to government ministers and had taken part in discussions with the \"regulatory authorities\" - which they declined to define - during the last few weeks, \"the most recent of which took place late on the evening of Friday June 9 ... these discussions led us to conclude that ... [we] could no longer act [as Petra's adviser] if the acquisition of Oryx Natural Resources were to proceed\". </p> <p>The Foreign Office said it had held no discussions specifically about Oryx with either the exchange or the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, but said so frequent were general discussions with the FSA that it was impossible to say whether or not the topic had ever arisen. </p> <p>Oryx is based in the Cayman Islands and managed from Oman. It denies that its Congo diamond concession makes it a producer of the type of \"conflict\" gems - precious stones the profits from which are used to fuel wars in Africa - despite the revenue sharing arrangements it has in place with companies connected to both the DRC government and the government of Zimbabwe, allies in the Congo's continuing civil struggle.</p>",

Yesterday the exchange denied having put pressure on Grant Thornton and the Foreign Office - reported to have been against the deal because of Oryx's links with the governments of Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo - denied having put pressure on the exchange. But a source close to Petra said: \"Someone's got to be made accountable for this\", adding, when asked if Petra's directors were considering a judicial review of the exchange's behaviour, \"clearly they're thinking about it\". At a special meeting of shareholders in London yesterday, chairman Adonis Pouroulis said that in view of the \"exceptional circumstances\" he had no alternative but to postpone indefinitely the merger proposal. Mr Pouroulis said he had been unable over the weekend to obtain a full explanation as to Grant Thornton's actions on Friday night. He said Grant Thornton had conducted extensive due diligence of Oryx and this had disclosed nothing untoward. Mr Pouroulis added: \"Grant Thornton have announced publicly that they concluded their due diligence process satisfactorily ... [and] that this process has cast no doubt on the probity of Petra, Oryx, its directors, any of its main shareholders or the proposed acquisition of Oryx.\" Grant Thornton officials yesterday confirmed the company had threatened to resign should the deal go ahead. \"As nominated adviser our primary responsibility is to the London stock exchange. As such we have a responsibility to maintain the reputation and integrity of the market,\" they said. They added they had noted recent statements attributed to government ministers and had taken part in discussions with the \"regulatory authorities\" - which they declined to define - during the last few weeks, \"the most recent of which took place late on the evening of Friday June 9 ... these discussions led us to conclude that ... [we] could no longer act [as Petra's adviser] if the acquisition of Oryx Natural Resources were to proceed\". The Foreign Office said it had held no discussions specifically about Oryx with either the exchange or the City regulator, the Financial Services Authority, but said so frequent were general discussions with the FSA that it was impossible to say whether or not the topic had ever arisen. Oryx is based in the Cayman Islands and managed from Oman. It denies that its Congo diamond concession makes it a producer of the type of \"conflict\" gems - precious stones the profits from which are used to fuel wars in Africa - despite the revenue sharing arrangements it has in place with companies connected to both the DRC government and the government of Zimbabwe, allies in the Congo's continuing civil struggle.",

      "bodyText": "Yugoslavia's president Slobodan Milosevic has won an important political victory in Serbia's sister republic of Montenegro after voters strongly backed his supporters in a key local election and rebuffed proponents of independence. In a poll seen as a partial referendum on the republic's future the 'Yugoslavia Coalition' took control of the coastal town of Herceg Novi from the pro-western government of President Milo Djukanovic, gaining 19 seats compared with the 13 they had before. Since becoming the republic's leader three years ago Mr Djukanovic has broken with Belgrade, introduced the German mark as an official currency and no longer recognises the federal government. He has won strong backing from the United States and European Union, although they do not support outright independence and have urged him to be cautious in not going so far as to risk civil war. The Yugoslav army has a powerful garrison in Montenengro which has regularly flexed its muscles by taking control of border points and issuing conscription notices to prominent anti-Belgrade journalists and politicians. Mr Djukanovic has created a paramilitary police as a counterweight and both sides accuse each other of preparing for civil war. The preliminary results from Sunday's poll show the polarisation of society but will reinforce Mr Djukanovic's cautious approach. His party did well in elections in the capital Podgorica and gained an extra seat - to give it a total of 28 in the 54-seat council - while the pro-Belgrade SNP lost one. The big losers in both places were the pro-independence Liberals who provoked the elections by walking out of coalitions with Mr Djukanovic. They expected the tensions of the last two years would have strengthened the case for immediate secession. But they lost ground. The pro-Serb forces tend to be concentrated in inland cities closer to the Serbian border but Herceg Novi has always had a high proportion of Serb migrants from Bosnia and Hercegovina. Since the collapse of Tito's Yugoslavia, the new headquarters of the Yugolav navy are nearby. Mr Djukanovic, who had earlier predicted victory in both towns, put a brave face on the result. \"Today we can say for sure that Montenegro is marching on a stable, democratic, reformist path and that no one can distract it from that path,\" he said. \"Our victory in Podgorica is much better and greater than our defeat in Herceg Novi,\" he added. Predrag Bulatovic, a leader of the pro-Belgrade block, said afterwards the vote proved that the people of Montenegro, who are mainly Orthodox Slavs, wanted to live with fellow-Slav Serbia. \"In this election the citizens showed they were for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\" Mr Bulatovic said, adding that the victory in Herceg Novi meant his party, already strong in the north, now held one-third of Montenegro's 21 municipalities.

He was exceptionally calm.\" The surgeon added that he could find no evidence that Copeland, who has admitted causing explosions in Soho, Brick Lane, and Brixton, had delusions, hallucinations or thought disorders. \"There was no sign at the time that he was suffering from a mental illness,\" he added. But he had recommended that Copeland, who told him he had stopped taking his medication for panic attacks a month earlier, be kept under observation while in police custody. \"There was no suggestion of any suicide intent. He maintained an exceptional degree of calmness ... It was almost surprising, the matter-of-factness with which he approached the whole thing.\" The jury also heard from Paul Mifsud, a colleague of Copeland on the Jubilee Line extension, and the man who identified him to police. Mr Mifsud, who described working with Copeland as \"five months of total anger about everything\", spoke of his disbelief when someone in a cafe showed him a newspaper photograph of the Brixton bomber and asked if it was Mungo - the name by which he called Copeland. The engineer took the paper to Copeland's father, Stephen Copeland. \"I said, 'Doesn't it look like David?' He replied: 'Yes, it does look a bit like him, but he has not got a white hat.' I just let it go.\" But after work he felt compelled to look at the newspaper pictures once more. When he got in, he told his wife, and she told him to ring the police. Mr Mifsud also spoke of his colleague's anger with his parents, whom the nailbomber claimed were convinced he was gay, and his fascination with serial killing. Under cross-examination, he said they had talked about Brixton, Brick Lane, the killing of Jill Dando, and a high school shooting in the US. \"I think I said how terrible it was, what was going on in the world - shooting and the bombings. He said: 'Great, isn't it - all these things happening'.\" Copeland pleads not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished reponsibility. The trial continues.",

      "body": "<p>Alot of waffle has been talked and written about TV alternatives to football as we enter the scheduling free-for-all that is Euro 2000. But if you wanted to escape far, far away from sport last night, Channel 4 had the dream ticket - or, as it turned out to be, nightmare. <strong> True Stories: Pimp Snooky</strong> was one of the most infuriating, depressing and exhilarating pieces of television to come this way for a long time - a trip deep, deep into the underworld in the demonic company of Milwaukee's premier procurer. </p> <p>Snooky, a handsome man in his late 20s or early 30s, ran a stable of prostitutes from a smart-looking house in the city. He cruised around in his flash Mercedes looking for fresh talent: \"gonna find me a new bitch today\", he said, putting on his headhunter's charm. It didn't last long. Once the new bitch, a hapless creature named Mika, had been recruited, she was subjected to a programme of mental torture that left her - and viewers - gasping with shock. </p> <p>Pimp Snooky was filmed over a 12-month period last year by Clive Gordon, a man who clearly knows no fear in pursuit of a good story. Such was the rapport between film-maker and subject that Snooky allowed Gordon to witness the most revealing moments of his life: knocking his girls around, trying to stay calm during a drive- by shooting, or coming sheepishly out of prison. He emerged, blinking and shaken, into the daylight, his drab sportswear in sharp contrast to his more usual pimp threads. \"I look like a trick\", he complained. \"They treated me like a trick.\" </p> <p>You might have expected the film to reveal a warm, caring side to Snooky, or to have led us to understand and perhaps sympathise with his way of life. But as he showed more and more of himself, we could only come to loathe him. His treatment of his women - and their terrified, brainwashed compliance - was jaw-droppingly horrible. He employed his nephew, a young man of about 19, to attempt to seduce the girls under concealed video surveillance; if they succumbed, they faced the wrath of \"Daddy\". He nutted Mika on the forehead, and would have done much worse had he not suddenly become aware of the camera's presence. He bragged endlessly about his financial acumen, and even organised a glitzy party (The International Players' Convention) to celebrate the pimp lifestyle. </p> <p>If all this sounds disgusting, it was - and yet it was impossible to stop watching. The Players' Convention was shown in slow-motion, the girls writhing obediently at the feet of their men, a carnival vision of hell. Mika's training by two of her \"wives-in-law\", Fantasia and Unique, was a ridiculous parody of sisterhood. \"You say yes and no, you call him Daddy at all times, you walk behind him, open doors, wait for him to get out of the car before you do. He puts his ho's on pedestals. He treats us like queens, so we gotta treat him like a king.\" And Snooky was a king in his own kingdom, a dictator no less. God help the girl who stepped out of line. Mika, who, it transpired, was only 18 and unprepared for life on the game, had her wrathful family on Snooky's tail, and we feared for her life. </p> <p>Gratifyingly, this little dystopia began to fall apart in the final section of the film. After the tacky climax of the Convention, Snooky spent a night in prison, endured gunmen shooting at his house and, we suspected, had heavier foes than Mika's irate uncle to deal with. The enemy was at the gates, and it was hard to fathom what was going on. Snooky remained calm throughout, but he was running scared. At the time of transmission, Snooky was in prison - probably the safest place for him, and it's a miracle that one of his bitches didn't pick up a gun and blow his head off first. </p> <p>Clive Gordon deserves to be showered with awards for having the guts to bring back this report from the pit. Presumably he developed some kind of rapport with Snooky (who called Gordon from jail, begging him to bail him out), but even so he didn't let it get in the way of this cold, dispassionate dissection. The rap soundtrack, with its usual catalogue of bragging and swearing, seemed comically feeble compared to the reality on screen. \"I'm not no crazy sadistic fucked- up-in-the-head fool\", said Snooky.

      "body": "<p>Janis Joplin, far-out chick singer, was sitting with her band in the Speakeasy, mecca for off-duty musicians. She was in London circa 1969 to play the Albert Hall with her new group, the Kozmic Blues Band. What you could see of her face was pale, unmade-up, her red hair looked coarse and hung like curtains across her cheeks. She wore a tall Cossack hat, and she looked done-in. </p> <p>A couple of nights later she came running onto the stage at the Albert Hall, dripping with beads, her emotional extremities cranked up, stomping her feet, hair now shimmering like a wild and glorious red aura as she shook and wriggled with rhythm and gave out with a voice cracked with the blues. It was unbelievable for a chick to be so wild and abandoned: the apparition, the sound, the vibe sent tingles down our spines. We'd never seen anything like it, she blew us away, it was the best hit. </p> <p>I was excited to get invited back to her hotel with the entourage of freaks that were milling around backstage. But as we entered her suite she was waving everyone back out again, distraught, dishevelled. One of the band had OD'd and was lying in the bath, being resuscitated by a half-dressed groupie. Life on the road. </p> <p>Janis's myth has grown over the years. She's become a bit of a template for liberation. She was outspoken, and made great copy. \"I just wanted to get stoned, get laid, have a good time.\" Didn't we all, but it wasn't as easy as it sounds, back then, over 30 years ago, to act like \"one of the boys\", and Janis paid a price for taking the guys on at their own game. </p> <p>Reputations: Southern Discomfort takes a look at Janis's life. Re-analysing her in the aftermath of feminism, all the sad old clich\u00e9s of the female condition are dredged up. Lurking deep inside the ballsy chick who'd made it in a guy's world, which rock'n'roll most definitely was in those days, was a straight, middle-class gal who wanted nothing more than to settle down behind white picket fences. Janis wanted a \"bear of a mountain man, throwing boulders, subduing nature,\" explains a remarkably healthy-looking survivor of Big Brother and the Holding Company, \"but those kind of guys never came to the gigs\". </p> <p>Big Brother were a head group from the San Francisco underground music scene. The twisted sound of stoned guitars pierced our disordered reason, and Janis filled the void with her soul-crazed voice. To hear her singing Ball And Chain was like an intravenous depth charge. \"That song's gonna get you a lot of lovers\", a friend had told her. Making love with Janis could be an alarming experience, according to one senior hip photographer in Clark Kent spectacles. \"There was a desperate rush for gratification that could frighten\", he tells us, and I wonder if that's what turned his hair so white. </p> <p>Janis was haunted by the dreary 50s role models she had rejected. Pimples made her hate herself. You'd think from this programme she never had a good time. Letters home to \"The Great Nowhere\" (Port Arthur, Texas) reveal that she longed for her parents' approval, but she was always onto a loser there, for to be a rock'n'roll singer wasn't considered a respectable career move in middle America, whatever your gender. She had taken the step beyond and could never go back, although she tried a couple of times, with disastrous results. </p> <p>Southern Discomfort gives us glimpses of the husky, funky Janis in excerpts from some live interviews. You can feel her, coming towards you, hungry for love, drenched in patchouli and bright satin, feathers flying, bangles jangling, bottle in one hand, telling you about Zelda (Mrs F Scott) Fitzgerald's philosophy of self-determination, and rounding it all off with that famous cackle. </p> <p>Being a right-on chick, Janis liked to dabble with the chicks in bed as well as the guys, and sometimes both at once. In fact, she liked to dabble with anything that made her feel good. \"I want to smoke dope, take dope, lick dope, suck dope and fuck dope\", she said. Although she was an acid-culture icon, psychedelics weren't her trip. When the big time beckoned in the shape of Albert Grossman (then Bob Dylan's manager), she left Big Brother wandering in their psychedelic fog. Murmurs from the counter-culture hinted that she had betrayed the hip spirit. </p> <p>There was no reason for her to die that night, considering she'd finally got together the band she really wanted, Full Tilt Boogie, and was on the verge of completing her brilliant album Pearl. But the endless broken romances, the heavy drinking, the smack, the pressure of an enormous ego - yet at the same time thinking she was \"the biggest piece of shit in the world\" - were an obvious recipe for oblivion. \"Janis was a real person, man\", said Jerry Garcia (of the Grateful Dead) shortly after her death. \"She was just like the rest of us, fucked-up, strung-out, in weird places. She was on a real hard path. She picked it, she chose it.\" </p> <p>Reputations, tonight, 9pm, BBC2</p>",

Reputations: Southern Discomfort takes a look at Janis's life. Re-analysing her in the aftermath of feminism, all the sad old clich\u00e9s of the female condition are dredged up. Lurking deep inside the ballsy chick who'd made it in a guy's world, which rock'n'roll most definitely was in those days, was a straight, middle-class gal who wanted nothing more than to settle down behind white picket fences. Janis wanted a \"bear of a mountain man, throwing boulders, subduing nature,\" explains a remarkably healthy-looking survivor of Big Brother and the Holding Company, \"but those kind of guys never came to the gigs\". Big Brother were a head group from the San Francisco underground music scene. The twisted sound of stoned guitars pierced our disordered reason, and Janis filled the void with her soul-crazed voice. To hear her singing Ball And Chain was like an intravenous depth charge. \"That song's gonna get you a lot of lovers\", a friend had told her. Making love with Janis could be an alarming experience, according to one senior hip photographer in Clark Kent spectacles. \"There was a desperate rush for gratification that could frighten\", he tells us, and I wonder if that's what turned his hair so white. Janis was haunted by the dreary 50s role models she had rejected. Pimples made her hate herself. You'd think from this programme she never had a good time. Letters home to \"The Great Nowhere\" (Port Arthur, Texas) reveal that she longed for her parents' approval, but she was always onto a loser there, for to be a rock'n'roll singer wasn't considered a respectable career move in middle America, whatever your gender. She had taken the step beyond and could never go back, although she tried a couple of times, with disastrous results. Southern Discomfort gives us glimpses of the husky, funky Janis in excerpts from some live interviews. You can feel her, coming towards you, hungry for love, drenched in patchouli and bright satin, feathers flying, bangles jangling, bottle in one hand, telling you about Zelda (Mrs F Scott) Fitzgerald's philosophy of self-determination, and rounding it all off with that famous cackle. Being a right-on chick, Janis liked to dabble with the chicks in bed as well as the guys, and sometimes both at once. In fact, she liked to dabble with anything that made her feel good. \"I want to smoke dope, take dope, lick dope, suck dope and fuck dope\", she said. Although she was an acid-culture icon, psychedelics weren't her trip. When the big time beckoned in the shape of Albert Grossman (then Bob Dylan's manager), she left Big Brother wandering in their psychedelic fog. Murmurs from the counter-culture hinted that she had betrayed the hip spirit. There was no reason for her to die that night, considering she'd finally got together the band she really wanted, Full Tilt Boogie, and was on the verge of completing her brilliant album Pearl. But the endless broken romances, the heavy drinking, the smack, the pressure of an enormous ego - yet at the same time thinking she was \"the biggest piece of shit in the world\" - were an obvious recipe for oblivion. \"Janis was a real person, man\", said Jerry Garcia (of the Grateful Dead) shortly after her death. \"She was just like the rest of us, fucked-up, strung-out, in weird places. She was on a real hard path. She picked it, she chose it.\" Reputations, tonight, 9pm, BBC2",

Then a muddy lane led through dripping undergrowth to a footbridge and across to a tiny island at the lake's edge. On the island stood the ancient church. Virginia Woolf's mother, a pre-Raphaelite beauty, married, at the age of 19, a son of the chateau up on the hill. He died only three years later. No one, she claimed, could have known such extremes of happiness and grief as she. Although reputedly undemonstrative, she was remembered to have come to stretch herself on his grave in this churchyard. The setting looked aptly desolate.",

Raulff's is a wonderful sentiment, mapping the opposite road to the one travelled by the organisers of the Millennium Dome, that monument to the beating down of knowledge, the throttling of the human imagination. </p> <p>Seven Hills, in the newly restored Martin Gropius Bau, a grand 19th-century civic palazzo, is a brave and relatively inexpensive attempt to present a survey of human knowledge, and its limits, at the beginning of the 21st century. (It cost DM28m - less than \u00a310m - compared with the dome's \u00a3758m-plus.) Such an encyclopedic enterprise could easily crack at the seams of its own pretension, and the organisers, Bodo-Michael Baumunk and Gereon Sievernich, have trodden a fine line between edification and entertainment. Their distinctive show, a map of the human mind, negotiates this cultural divide without stumbling or falling. If you like Sir John Soane's Museum in London or the Pitt-Rivers Museum in Oxford, if you like surfing the net or picking books at random from well-stocked library shelves, Seven Hills will be alive for you. If you like the dome, save the air fair to Berlin and stock up the deep freeze instead. </p> <p>Seven Hills is helped enormously by being held within a grand old building in the centre of one of the world's most compelling cities. Unlike the old-fashioned Hanover Expo, with its sledgehammer appeal to nationalist sentiment (my pavilion's better than yours), Seven Hills attempts to immerse visitors in a universal experience of what it means to be alive at a time when exhilarating and frightening new technologies are opening up, when we can look deep into the universe at both macro and micro levels: in one direction into the furthest perceptible depths of interstellar space, in the other down into the world of cells, of Watson and Crick's DNA spiral. </p> <p>We understand this infinite universe by placing ourselves and our world at its centre. So the design of this modern cabinet of curiosities is centred around a glowing model of the Earth, in a brooding, cathedral-like hall re-dressed for the occasion by Ken Adam, the great film set designer (Goldfinger, Dr Strangelove, The Madness of King George and so on). Adam's living earth, a ball of magma and fire, is set like some ancient religious idol atop a skeletal, space programme-style pyramid. This chariot of fire is surrounded by some of the magnificent machines and devices humankind has invented to explore the Earth and outer space. </p> <p>In a darkly theatrical atmosphere, the visitor is encouraged to peer pruriently into the preserved skull of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, to walk through a section of a particle accelerator, to meet the latest humanoid robot (courtesy of those clever people at Sony) and to watch robot dachshunds play football. If this sounds a mish-mash of conflicting ideas and objects, it doesn't feel like it: one experience or exhibit prompts the next. This is a multi-layered show, a brave mix of objects drawn from historic collections, of ideas written up intelligently in captions that do not talk down to their audience, and interactive computer technology. And it works. </p> <p>Adam's Nucleus is surrounded on two floors by sections labelled Cosmos, Jungle, Civilisation, Faith, Knowledge and Dream, designed imaginatively by a mix of architects (Lebbeus Woods, and Lars Gr\u00e4bner and Gerrit Grigoleit from Daniel Libeskind's office), set designers and artists. Together they have created an enfilade of galleries that present our hopes, desires, dreams and ideas in a way that stirs the imagination. The Space gallery is an entertaining mixture of objects ranging from children's comics and Thunderbird-style toys and models to the most adult insights into quests for worlds where no man or woman has gone before. </p> <p>The Jungle section brings out the way in which humans have slaughtered and enslaved their fellow species while celebrating their variety and beauty. There are illuminated cases of exotic insects and birds, pickled bodies of just about everything that might have lived and, most tellingly of all, real-time video projections of magnificent, if bored, tigers in the Berlin and Leipzig zoos. </p> <p>The show is just the right size, an intense yet enjoyable and provocative experience that shows how today's museums and galleries could layer collections of objects with the latest in computer and presentation technology while employing imaginative architects and set designers to create the drama needed to entertain visitors even while they are learning.

      "body": "<p>Richard Billingham's photographs and videos of his family are now familiar. We know them all: overweight, tattooed, animal-loving Liz. Rheumy, red-eyed husband Ray. Younger brother Jason, now a dad. The flora and fauna of the Billingham household - the dogs, cats, goldfish, snakes and flies - are as much protagonists in the photographs as the people themselves. </p> <p>As Michael Tarantino writes in his elegant essay for Billingham's solo exhibition at Birmingham's Ikon Gallery, the dogs are fully fledged participants in the family circle, but give nothing away. We must ask how much we think we know, where we are in this. We study the closed world that Billingham charts - the alarming wallpaper, the plastic flowers and knick-knacks, the piles of accumulated belongings, the mould, the grease, the houseproud moments salvaged from the clutter - and imagine we can place it all. But an enigma remains. </p> <p>Who needs the Royle family or Big Brother (the frightening and morally questionable Dutch fly- on-the-wall docu-soap) when Billingham records this unadulterated everyday reality? There are no actors and no script. Even if the photographs never told us what the Billinghams sounded like, we could always imagine the bickering, the silences and taunts, Ray's drunken incoherence, Liz's constant plaint. We now know exactly the timbre of discontent, thanks to Billingham's Fishtank, shown on Channel 4 in 1998. There was Ray, maundering and mumbling and falling over; wanton Jason swatting flies; Liz, smoking, eating, angry with her life. </p> <p>\"I've had bastard 'nough of you today,\" said Liz, in Fishtank. \"I don't like this kind of living, I don't.\" They try to leave, they say they're about to leave, but they don't. Or if they do, they always go back. Even Billingham goes back. That's what he does. The pets look on. </p> <p>Billingham, at 30, is famous. He has made it to the cover of Artforum, the most important American art magazine. He has been interviewed by Lynn Barber (an equally infallible guide), and he won the first CitiBank Photography Prize, putting several social documentary photographers' noses out of joint. Ray's a Laugh, a compilation of Billingham's photographs, sold out. I saw it on the street stalls of Manhattan and Madrid. </p> <p>I have always wondered what foreign audiences make of Billingham's work. Walking into a New York gallery to find the raw detail of poverty-line, problem-family life in Birmingham is a disconcerting translocation of the utterly familiar, the consummately local. If the images on the wall depicted Birmingham, Alabama we wouldn't raise an eyebrow - that would be Americana, Dirty Realism for the world at large. There are lives like these everywhere. And lives much worse, just as ordinary, just as truthful. </p> <p>Billingham fascinates and appals and makes us laugh. He is no Walker Evans, getting poor southern sharecroppers to pose for him; no Diane Arbus with her misfits, no Don McCullin in the family war-zone. There is no angle in Billingham's images, no condescension, no critique. What are we - an audience of social workers, making an assessment? The Ikon Gallery exhibition is a total vindication of Billingham's art, of the quality of his photographs and videos, and of their status. It has often been repeated that he only began to photograph his family as an aid to making paintings while a student, and that what he really wants to be is a painter. He has a painter's eye, an eye for the pictorial, for pictorial drama, for the telling image, for brevity. </p> <p>It is often assumed that his images are uncomposed, quick on the draw snaps. They have that back-from-the-chemist look. He likes taking pictures. But look again: the violet afternoon fog through the dirty window, framed by the inner darkness of the room, the grainy light coming in. The video of Liz in profile, smoking; the condensation on the window behind her, the rain pattering down outside, the smoke curling, the suck and draw of the smoke, Liz murdering time. A photo of the bars of the electric heater, the sallow yellow and orange. The photograph burns up all the oxygen in the room and in your head. Time for a nag and another fag. Who would pay such close attention to this object, much less photograph it? Someone who has spent a long time staring, doing nothing, staring some more. </p> <p>Billingham has a feral hunger for the unregarded moment. For a long time it seemed that proximity was all, and that the claustrophobia of his images was the effect of being a man in a box, capturing a world in a box (the box of the room, the box of the camera). It is unsurprising that Billingham looked hard at the paintings of Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon while he was a student. Ray looks a bit like Freud. Billingham recognises the beauty in squalor, the plenitude of detail in a wretched room, in an image of Liz in a hideous floral dress, doing a jigsaw, Ray looking at the dog. The way the curtains hang. Billingham shows us Ray as a stumbling, incoherent fool, but he also shows us Ray's humanity. Ray staring uncomprehending at a pile of bread. Ray eyeing up dog-ends as though there were some answer in their alignment. Out of focus Ray in bed, the covers up to his neck, harried by the camera. Ray, toothless, caught in a laughing grimace in a dusty mirror. This last is an incredible image. A profound image, a terrible and terrifying image. It goes right through me. It is incontrovertible. It transcends its own cliche, and anything I might say about it. I had never seen Billingham's black and white photographs before this. They are better than he knows. </p> <p>Billingham has always made memorable images - Liz like Goya's Maja, her body turned towards the camera, hands clasped behind her head. Gazing not at the camera but at the unseen TV. Liz doing a jigsaw, and giving us a stained-toothed smile as she feeds a kitten. Ray falling over. Ray and Jason together, good health and ill-health. \"I do all these shows,\" Billingham told me, \"and they always want the same old images.\" </p> <p>Some newer works give us a battery of images, and photographs taken so close to their subject as to become almost abstract. A large triptych of Ray's hand judders in and out of focus, skin in folds and craters. And a 36-shot, multi-part work of Ray in close-up, like a giant contact print. The hand and the cigarette, the mouth pursed, the saggy neck, the empty glass inverted. The images going blam blam blam through the entire roll of film. </p> <p>Of Billingham's recent video works, Playstation is the best. It is a close-up of Jason flailing at the buttons with filthy, manic fingers and bitten-down nails. A mad plastic clatter drowning out the voices in the room. Oddly, Playstation reminded me of Steve McQueen's new work, Cold Breath: it has the same inwardness, the same tight focus. The Playstation keeps the player occupied, isolated and insulated from the world. </p> <p>Finally we go outside, in Billingham's photographs of the locality. There's no one about, the sky is a benign blue. Trees flip their leaves in the summer breeze. The tarmac meets old concrete. Embankments, factory buildings, a path over a field with buttercups. A parked car. The scenes are nearly bucolic. What there is in all Billingham's work, I realise, is a kind of warmth, the light of acceptance. The enigma, too, of why and how such ordinariness can be so heartbreakingly rendered and retold. \"I just like taking the pictures,\" he told me. </p> <p>Richard Billingham is at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (0121-248 0708), till July 16.</p>",

A photo of the bars of the electric heater, the sallow yellow and orange. The photograph burns up all the oxygen in the room and in your head. Time for a nag and another fag. Who would pay such close attention to this object, much less photograph it? Someone who has spent a long time staring, doing nothing, staring some more. Billingham has a feral hunger for the unregarded moment. For a long time it seemed that proximity was all, and that the claustrophobia of his images was the effect of being a man in a box, capturing a world in a box (the box of the room, the box of the camera). It is unsurprising that Billingham looked hard at the paintings of Lucian Freud and Francis Bacon while he was a student. Ray looks a bit like Freud. Billingham recognises the beauty in squalor, the plenitude of detail in a wretched room, in an image of Liz in a hideous floral dress, doing a jigsaw, Ray looking at the dog. The way the curtains hang. Billingham shows us Ray as a stumbling, incoherent fool, but he also shows us Ray's humanity. Ray staring uncomprehending at a pile of bread. Ray eyeing up dog-ends as though there were some answer in their alignment. Out of focus Ray in bed, the covers up to his neck, harried by the camera. Ray, toothless, caught in a laughing grimace in a dusty mirror. This last is an incredible image. A profound image, a terrible and terrifying image. It goes right through me. It is incontrovertible. It transcends its own cliche, and anything I might say about it. I had never seen Billingham's black and white photographs before this. They are better than he knows. Billingham has always made memorable images - Liz like Goya's Maja, her body turned towards the camera, hands clasped behind her head. Gazing not at the camera but at the unseen TV. Liz doing a jigsaw, and giving us a stained-toothed smile as she feeds a kitten. Ray falling over. Ray and Jason together, good health and ill-health. \"I do all these shows,\" Billingham told me, \"and they always want the same old images.\" Some newer works give us a battery of images, and photographs taken so close to their subject as to become almost abstract. A large triptych of Ray's hand judders in and out of focus, skin in folds and craters. And a 36-shot, multi-part work of Ray in close-up, like a giant contact print. The hand and the cigarette, the mouth pursed, the saggy neck, the empty glass inverted. The images going blam blam blam through the entire roll of film. Of Billingham's recent video works, Playstation is the best. It is a close-up of Jason flailing at the buttons with filthy, manic fingers and bitten-down nails. A mad plastic clatter drowning out the voices in the room. Oddly, Playstation reminded me of Steve McQueen's new work, Cold Breath: it has the same inwardness, the same tight focus. The Playstation keeps the player occupied, isolated and insulated from the world. Finally we go outside, in Billingham's photographs of the locality. There's no one about, the sky is a benign blue. Trees flip their leaves in the summer breeze. The tarmac meets old concrete. Embankments, factory buildings, a path over a field with buttercups. A parked car. The scenes are nearly bucolic. What there is in all Billingham's work, I realise, is a kind of warmth, the light of acceptance. The enigma, too, of why and how such ordinariness can be so heartbreakingly rendered and retold. \"I just like taking the pictures,\" he told me. Richard Billingham is at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (0121-248 0708), till July 16.",

Lino Oviedo faces extradition to Paraguay where he is wanted in connection with the murder last year of the vice-president, Luis Argana, in the bloodiest incident in a series of power struggles since the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner was overthrown a decade ago. Oviedo, a charismatic rabble-rouser nicknamed the \"bonsai horseman\" for his diminutive stature, had fled the country after the death of Argana, a bitter political rival despite belonging to the same party. Argentina initially granted Oviedo asylum in Tierra del Fuego, but eight months later he disappeared and started giving media interviews from a location he claimed was in Paraguay; it was assumed he was plotting his political revenge from somewhere near the Brazilian border. Oviedo was found in a friend's apartment at Foz do Iguacu, a tourist town at the triple frontier of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. \"He did not resist, but he had an illegal revolver and many [mobile] phones with him,\" the arresting officer is reported to have said. Paraguay, which has had 45 coups or attempted coups in the past 100 years - including two in the past four years authored by Oviedo - is the most politically unstable country in Latin America's southern cone. Its instability and endemic corruption is a weak point of the Mercosur trade block that includes Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and associate members Chile and Bolivia.

But Colin Bainbridge, 35, insisted her death was an accident. He told Newcastle crown court that Laura had gone with him to his home in Murton, Co Durham, to see his baby son. But when he was not there, she persuaded him \"reluctantly\" to play a game of \"tie-up\". The jury had already heard how Bainbridge would play the game with Laura and other children. Bainbridge told the jury that after binding her hand and feet, and gagging her he left the room to feed his dog. He returned 15 minutes later to discover Laura dead on the floor. Bainbridge denies indecent assault, rape and murder. The trial continues. Press Association",

Jean Rose, a designer and lecturer, was 49 when she died in September 1996, two years after her aggressive breast cancer was eventually diagnosed. A home video, showing the mother-of-two in bed shortly before her death, formed part of her husband Anthony's action against Alan Duke. Judge Elizabeth Steel, sitting in the high court in London, said it was no part of Mr Rose's case that the failure to identify the lump when the GP saw his wife at the health centre in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, in August 1993, was negligent. But she said Dr Duke, who has since retired, should have referred Mrs Rose for specialist opinion. If he had, said the judge, Mrs Rose's condition would have been detected by September 1993 and she would have had the chance of at least another 10 years of life. The judge found that Dr Duke, who denied negligence, was liable in the light of expert opinion that Mrs Rose should have been referred for investigation after she told him about the lump and her mother and aunt's history of breast cancer. She also found that the failure to refer caused injury as, in September 1993, Mrs Rose's tumour had not spread to her lymph nodes. Dr Duke, was supported by the Medical Defence Union.

      "body": "<p>She feels sick at the prospect and has to be comforted by friends. They tell her how brave she is - and one admits she would throw herself under a bus if she had to do it. You would think they were discussing a terrifying event, like giving evidence in a particularly horrible rape trial, but Ally Edgar and her friends, who appear in a documentary on Channel 4 tonight, are talking about her decision to give up make-up for a week.</p> <p>Yes, I do mean that sticky stuff most of us put on our lips and eyelids. If going without for a few days does not strike you as a reason for suicidal depression, then you do not belong to that brigade of women who would not be seen dead in Sainsbury's without the full slap. I am sometimes amazed, when I turn up at studios to take part in early-morning radio programmes, by the appearance of the other female guests. They glide in at 7.30am with unchipped nail polish and gleaming lips, when I have merely fallen out of bed into a pair of jeans - the audience can't see you on radio, for God's sake. There are women who always put on lip gloss before answering the front door and tonight's Can You Live Without is about one of them.</p> <p>But our relationship with make-up is not a simple matter, dividing us into those who do and those who don't. Women often talk about pampering themselves and the kick they get from signing a credit card slip for \u00a360 at the cosmetics counter, implying that make-up is a luxury. Yet it is often the same women who are horrified at the idea of leaving home with a bare face, suggesting it is essential - perhaps even a form of tyranny.</p> <p>Even the word make-up is evocative, a relative of making up, which is what you do when you fall out with a friend. You also make up for something that's gone wrong, which may be what lots of women feel when contemplating their natural faces in the mirror. Its synonym, cosmetics, appears much more neutral at first, deriving from the Greek noun kosmos, meaning ornament. But when you realise that the same word also means both order and the universe, it is hard to resist the notion that putting on make-up is a highly significant, if not quite a cosmic, act.</p> <p>Women wear it, men don't, unless they happen to be Boy George or Robert Kilroy-Silk. Although men's ranges of cosmetics have expanded well beyond aftershave, they are still concentrated in areas like body lotion. Few men wear eyeshadow and if they did, most of us would feel uncomfortable. (When a boyfriend once complained that I wouldn't let him try my make-up, even as a joke, I discovered that superficial signifiers of gender difference were more important to me than I had previously realised. I'm not sharing my Clinique Black Violet lipstick with anyone.)</p> <p>This is one of those strange imbalances between the sexes we rarely question because we are so used to it. Men tend to look more or less the same, unless they have flu or a hangover. Women's appearance, on the other hand, can vary dramatically. Few of us know what Joan Collins looks like beneath her maquillage, but there are magazines that specialise in photographing stars off duty, as they return home frazzled after collecting their children from school.</p> <p>There is no doubt that, for some women, make-up has a complicated and integral relationship to their idea of themselves. While movie stars are under a professional obligation to confirm to the prevailing notion of beauty, there are plenty of ordinary women whose self-esteem is intimately bound up with the face they present to the world. The Beatles captured this sense of identity as something women put on, rather than have naturally, in their song Eleanor Rigby, about a lonely woman who wears a \"face that she keeps in a jar by the door\".</p> <p>Interestingly, there is often a gap between the way women perceive themselves, with and without make-up, and what the rest of the world sees. Ally Edgar is an extreme example, unable to believe people will like her without her public face. Yet the difference is nothing like as great as she perceives it to be, suggesting that make-up is more a prop for her self-esteem than a miracle transformation.</p> <p>The gap between fantasy and reality is so great that some women, like the late Barbara Cartland, make themselves up to look positively ridiculous, yet do not seem to realise it. It is probably true that we all carry around an idealised version of the self, which can receive a rude shock in unguarded moments - unexpectedly catching sight of yourself in a mirror after a series of late nights, for instance. But there are women who pile on mascara and blusher in deeply unflattering quantities, over-riding the evidence of their senses, like anorexics. Sometimes it is a result of failing to take account of age, sticking to a routine they started in their 20s when they reach their 50s. Even the late Princess of Wales, with all the fashion advice available to her, was famous for her unwise attachment to blue eyeliner.</p> <p>It is hardly surprising, in a culture that bombards us with perfect images, that we internalise them and try to reproduce the effect on our own faces. It is as though femininity, far from being innate, is something that has to be constructed - even if fashion then demands, as it currently does, that the effect be as \"natural\" as possible. When men say they don't like make-up, it usually means just that; they don't like it to be too obvious.

      "bodyText": "She feels sick at the prospect and has to be comforted by friends. They tell her how brave she is - and one admits she would throw herself under a bus if she had to do it. You would think they were discussing a terrifying event, like giving evidence in a particularly horrible rape trial, but Ally Edgar and her friends, who appear in a documentary on Channel 4 tonight, are talking about her decision to give up make-up for a week. Yes, I do mean that sticky stuff most of us put on our lips and eyelids. If going without for a few days does not strike you as a reason for suicidal depression, then you do not belong to that brigade of women who would not be seen dead in Sainsbury's without the full slap. I am sometimes amazed, when I turn up at studios to take part in early-morning radio programmes, by the appearance of the other female guests. They glide in at 7.30am with unchipped nail polish and gleaming lips, when I have merely fallen out of bed into a pair of jeans - the audience can't see you on radio, for God's sake. There are women who always put on lip gloss before answering the front door and tonight's Can You Live Without is about one of them. But our relationship with make-up is not a simple matter, dividing us into those who do and those who don't. Women often talk about pampering themselves and the kick they get from signing a credit card slip for \u00a360 at the cosmetics counter, implying that make-up is a luxury. Yet it is often the same women who are horrified at the idea of leaving home with a bare face, suggesting it is essential - perhaps even a form of tyranny. Even the word make-up is evocative, a relative of making up, which is what you do when you fall out with a friend. You also make up for something that's gone wrong, which may be what lots of women feel when contemplating their natural faces in the mirror. Its synonym, cosmetics, appears much more neutral at first, deriving from the Greek noun kosmos, meaning ornament. But when you realise that the same word also means both order and the universe, it is hard to resist the notion that putting on make-up is a highly significant, if not quite a cosmic, act. Women wear it, men don't, unless they happen to be Boy George or Robert Kilroy-Silk. Although men's ranges of cosmetics have expanded well beyond aftershave, they are still concentrated in areas like body lotion. Few men wear eyeshadow and if they did, most of us would feel uncomfortable. (When a boyfriend once complained that I wouldn't let him try my make-up, even as a joke, I discovered that superficial signifiers of gender difference were more important to me than I had previously realised. I'm not sharing my Clinique Black Violet lipstick with anyone.) This is one of those strange imbalances between the sexes we rarely question because we are so used to it. Men tend to look more or less the same, unless they have flu or a hangover. Women's appearance, on the other hand, can vary dramatically. Few of us know what Joan Collins looks like beneath her maquillage, but there are magazines that specialise in photographing stars off duty, as they return home frazzled after collecting their children from school. There is no doubt that, for some women, make-up has a complicated and integral relationship to their idea of themselves. While movie stars are under a professional obligation to confirm to the prevailing notion of beauty, there are plenty of ordinary women whose self-esteem is intimately bound up with the face they present to the world. The Beatles captured this sense of identity as something women put on, rather than have naturally, in their song Eleanor Rigby, about a lonely woman who wears a \"face that she keeps in a jar by the door\". Interestingly, there is often a gap between the way women perceive themselves, with and without make-up, and what the rest of the world sees. Ally Edgar is an extreme example, unable to believe people will like her without her public face. Yet the difference is nothing like as great as she perceives it to be, suggesting that make-up is more a prop for her self-esteem than a miracle transformation. The gap between fantasy and reality is so great that some women, like the late Barbara Cartland, make themselves up to look positively ridiculous, yet do not seem to realise it. It is probably true that we all carry around an idealised version of the self, which can receive a rude shock in unguarded moments - unexpectedly catching sight of yourself in a mirror after a series of late nights, for instance. But there are women who pile on mascara and blusher in deeply unflattering quantities, over-riding the evidence of their senses, like anorexics. Sometimes it is a result of failing to take account of age, sticking to a routine they started in their 20s when they reach their 50s. Even the late Princess of Wales, with all the fashion advice available to her, was famous for her unwise attachment to blue eyeliner. It is hardly surprising, in a culture that bombards us with perfect images, that we internalise them and try to reproduce the effect on our own faces. It is as though femininity, far from being innate, is something that has to be constructed - even if fashion then demands, as it currently does, that the effect be as \"natural\" as possible. When men say they don't like make-up, it usually means just that; they don't like it to be too obvious. And women are right when they say they wear cosmetics for themselves, for the aim is surely to be the ideal woman - at least a less imperfect woman - rather than to attract the ideal man. It is equally unsurprising, though rather sad, that some women take make-up so seriously. Choosing lipstick and perfume are pleasures, as is the moment when you put them on. It carries with it a childlike enjoyment of dressing up, as long as it doesn't leave you feeling unbearably naked when you take it off. One question tonight's film does not address is what happens if you're a single woman, in search of a lover, whose self-esteem is dependent on a carefully constructed face.

Tony Burt, 63, told neighbours and police his son Steven had gone travelling while he kept his decomposing corpse on the sofa where he is believed to have died. He only decided to move the remains - then weighing just over a stone - once he agreed to sell the ramshackle bungalow they had shared in Woodbridge, Suffolk, it was stated at Ipswich crown court. Mark Norman, prosecuting, told the jury that Burt, who had been divorced for more than 20 years from Steven's mother, then placed the mummified body in a sleeping bag and dumped it in a nearby park. The remains, which had not been hidden, were found a fortnight later, in December 1998, by a former policeman walking his dog. The body was only identified through DNA tests - but a sofa cushion, found in Burt's home, was indented with the shape of two human legs which matched the remains. Burt, a former accountant for the Guardian Royal Exchange, denies failing to carry out a Christian burial for his son and causing a nuisance by depositing human remains on public grounds. After being arrested, he insisted he did not know what had happened to his son, a one time farm labourer.

The report describes the trade as \"the theft of history\", and outlines the increasing involvement of criminals and drug barons; sites in Africa, the far east and South America being pillaged to order for collectors; and the injuries and deaths of museum staff, particularly in Africa, where looters are targeting existing collections.

Archaeologists are in despair over the trade because in stripping the objects of their context, the looters destroy the wealth of information which they might reveal of the cultures which made them. Many of the most notorious cases concern Africa and the far east, but British sites are also being targeted: Wanborough in Guildford became notorious in the 1980s, when gangs of treasure hunters came by night with metal detectors and removed sack loads of Roman coins, mostly since sold abroad. Two years ago, after reports that treasure hunters has returned, archaeologists carried out an emergency excavation to learn what they could about the site - which may have been of importance to pagans then re-used as a Roman temple. Tony Robinson, presenter of the Channel 4's archaeology series Time Team, said: \"To rip archaeology out of the earth is an attack not just on us but on our children too.\" He said in touring the country for the series he had come across innumerable stories of landowners calling in the police to deal with unauthorised metal detectorists, only to find the police or magistrates interested or even amused by what they saw as a harmless hobby.",

      "body": "<p>Some reporters' questions have to be unashamedly fatuous. Was the tyro West Indian leftie, Wavell Hinds, pleased with himself after his engaging, undefeated 105 pipe-opener (out of 176) on a difficult pitch in Cardiff last week? \"It was good to get a start. But it is only a start,\" said the earnest and friendly young man. Had it set him up for Thursday's first test at Edgbaston? \"I have not been selected yet,\" he said. </p> <p>In no time, while fielding at silly-point in Glamorgan's second innings, Hinds took a fearful blow on the ankle, so he has spent the approach to the test nursing not only relieving ice-packs but the possibility of solving the tourists' one serious problem by moving up the order to open the innings with Sherwin Campbell. Which would mean five of the West Indies top-six being left-handers. \"Does that matter if they are our best top-six batsmen?\" asks their coach Roger Harper. </p> <p>The grandest batting triumvirate of all time, the 3W's of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott, first burst upon England precisely a half century ago. Not 24 till September, WW Hinds is younger, just, than each of those immortals when they landed for the epic 1950 tour - and like Frank Worrell and Everton Weekes, Wavell Wayne Hinds comes to England the summer after a dress rehearsal on the differently difficult wickets in the Lancashire leagues. Last year Hinds was pro to the Oldham club Werneth. </p> <p>That testing apprenticeship, plus a sound one with the West Indian under-19 and A sides, was thrillingly seen to blossom into colourful full bloom only these three months. And how. For in Jamaica in March, in the inter-island Busta Cup final, Hinds hit a resplendent 127. That same month, in his test debut innings at Port-of-Spain against Zimbabwe, he made a composed 46 not out out of a total 187. A fortnight later, on April 2, in only his second one-day international, Hinds hit 12 fours and a six in an undefeated 116 against Zimbabwe on his home paddock at Kingston.

      "bodyText": "Some reporters' questions have to be unashamedly fatuous. Was the tyro West Indian leftie, Wavell Hinds, pleased with himself after his engaging, undefeated 105 pipe-opener (out of 176) on a difficult pitch in Cardiff last week? \"It was good to get a start. But it is only a start,\" said the earnest and friendly young man. Had it set him up for Thursday's first test at Edgbaston? \"I have not been selected yet,\" he said. In no time, while fielding at silly-point in Glamorgan's second innings, Hinds took a fearful blow on the ankle, so he has spent the approach to the test nursing not only relieving ice-packs but the possibility of solving the tourists' one serious problem by moving up the order to open the innings with Sherwin Campbell. Which would mean five of the West Indies top-six being left-handers. \"Does that matter if they are our best top-six batsmen?\" asks their coach Roger Harper. The grandest batting triumvirate of all time, the 3W's of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott, first burst upon England precisely a half century ago. Not 24 till September, WW Hinds is younger, just, than each of those immortals when they landed for the epic 1950 tour - and like Frank Worrell and Everton Weekes, Wavell Wayne Hinds comes to England the summer after a dress rehearsal on the differently difficult wickets in the Lancashire leagues. Last year Hinds was pro to the Oldham club Werneth. That testing apprenticeship, plus a sound one with the West Indian under-19 and A sides, was thrillingly seen to blossom into colourful full bloom only these three months. And how. For in Jamaica in March, in the inter-island Busta Cup final, Hinds hit a resplendent 127. That same month, in his test debut innings at Port-of-Spain against Zimbabwe, he made a composed 46 not out out of a total 187. A fortnight later, on April 2, in only his second one-day international, Hinds hit 12 fours and a six in an undefeated 116 against Zimbabwe on his home paddock at Kingston. And when Pakistan arrived in May, at Bridgetown he sent reeling into tailspin one of the game's most outstanding attacks (Wasim, Waqar, Saqlain, and Mushtaq) with 165 with 24 fours. Come June, and his overture for beginners was on that turner at Cardiff against Robert Croft and another century - \"all power and timing,\" wrote one enthralled Welsh reporter. Power, that power to make extra-cover fear for his wrists and ankles, is the first word that strikes the watcher. Hinds hits with his forearms, chest, and shoulders coiled as one.

Meanwhile police in Colombo will search the ground and local hotels for bookmakers when the first test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan begins tomorrow.",

Essentially, neither side's defence could quite cope with the opposition's best attacks, which is how the game should be. </p> <p>England treated Portugal as if they were Brazil, which is close enough to the truth. That 1-1 draw at Wembley on May 25 was clearly a valuable dress rehearsal, since Kevin Keegan sent out exactly the same side - with the sole exception of Steve McManaman, who was excused duty that day, replacing Dennis Wise. Paul Scholes and Paul Ince attempted to lock up the middle, although the manager had clearly modified Scholes's role, allowing the Manchester United man to range further forward when the opportunity presented itself, as it did almost before the match had drawn breath. </p> <p>The combination of a pleasant summer day, half-strength beer and the Dutch observance of Pentecost kept the fans' temperature down before the kick-off, but it was to rise as soon as play began, and for exactly the right reasons. </p> <p>England's opening goal was stamped \"Made in Manchester\" as Phil Neville overlapped on the right, hit a raking cross with his generally unemployed left foot and saw David Beckham return it from beyond the far post for Scholes to head home. </p> <p>There was a strong Liverpool flavour to the second effort, begun when Michael Owen fed Beckham, whose cross produced a sidefoot shot past Vitor Baia from Steve McManaman. </p> <p>These are not irrelevant thoughts. England played in the first half with the togetherness of a good club side. To see McManaman and the younger Neville encouraging each other in the task of controlling the right flank of Portugal's attack was to understand the spirit with which Keegan has infused the side. Neville spoke last week of the need to use attack as a means of defence, preventing Portugal's right back, Abel Xavier, from giving Luis Figo support, and the ploy certainly worked - in so far as Figo was quickly forced inside. </p> <p>Unfortunately for England, it does not really make much difference where Figo is forced to roam in order to do his work. When he and Manuel Rui Costa moved forward together through the middle, exchanging passes between England's defenders, a reply to England's early lead was not far away. </p> <p>In fact it was delayed only by the callow errors of Nuno Gomes, the 23-year-old Benfica forward replacing the injured Ricardo Sa Pinto. Gomes had failed to score in eight senior international appearances before last night, and his efforts to control the ball with his back to goal consistently foundered on England's central defence. </p> <p>But when Dennis Wise lost the ball with his first touch after coming on as a substitute for McManaman in the 58th minute, it was Gomes who raced on to Rui Costa's clever diagonal ball to complete an epic comeback by firing Portugal into a 3-2 lead. Ten minutes later he latched on to another pass from the same provider and drove narrowly wide from almost 30 yards. </p> <p>Portugal's response to England's challenge had been nothing short of majestic. Figo's long-range shot and Joao Pinto's glancing header set up the game for a second half in which nerves were exposed and courage on both sides constantly tested. England's assaults always carried the danger of creating the opportunity for Portuguese breakaways, and the departure of McManaman reduced not just the level of guile in England's midfield but also the ability to retain the ball while patiently constructing multi-phase attacks - a characteristic usually missing from England's game, but a telling feature of the team's play in the first half. </p> <p>The departure of Owen and the arrival of Emile Heskey at half-time increased the weight of England's attacks without sharpening their threat. Owen had done little of great consequence in the first period, beyond setting up the move for the second goal, but he had been a swift and persistent presence at the heart of the Portuguese defence. Curiously the diminutive Scholes provided the greatest aerial threat after Heskey's arrival, forcing a series of heroic defensive headers from Fernando Couto and Abel Xavier. </p> <p>But with McManaman had gone England's ability to think on the ball, to move collectively, to keep defenders waiting and guessing before threading passes between them. The attempts at all-out assault that were the response to the need to find a third goal foundered on the inaccuracy that comes from over-anxiety. The thread had been broken, which only goes to show how fine and fragile, in England's case, it is.</p>",
