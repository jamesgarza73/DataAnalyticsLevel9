William Straw, 47, was fined \u00a3750 plus \u00a3275 costs and was ordered to remain on the sex offenders' register for five years. Straw, an administrator for the Open University, was accused of assaulting the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in Bramcote, Nottingham, on April 19. He denied the offence when he appeared before Nottingham magistrates later that month but was convicted by district judge Peter Nuttall at yesterday's resumed hearing. The court was told that he had met the girl while out shopping and had invited her to his home to see his new dog. The girl declined but Straw later rang her home, repeated the offer, rode to the house on his bike and invited himself in. The girl said Straw, who is married but separated and has two children, touched part of her stomach exposed below her crop top and then asked if he could see her bedroom. \"I started to get more worried but he was a family friend, so I said yes,\" she added. She said she and Straw went to the bedroom where he sat on the bed. He stroked it and commented on its softness. As they left the room to go back downstairs, Straw put his hands on her hips. \"He started rubbing my hips and staring at my breasts. I told him he was scaring me and he seemed to snap out of a trance.\" Straw apologised, went back downstairs and left a short time later, the court heard. Straw told the court he agreed with most of the girl's evidence but denied touching her.

Gen Jetley never officially submitted the document to the UN but it has been widely circulated among members of the Security Council and other major players in Sierra Leone. Its damning criticism of the Nigerians, and its exposure of the deep divisions that have all but paralysed the UN mission, has added pressure for a major shakeup of a discredited peacekeeping force that Britain is counting on to play a leading role in the defeat of the RUF.</p> <p>Gen Jetley singles out three Nigerians for particular criticism: Kofi Annan's special representative in Freetown, under-secretary-general Oluyemi Adeniji; the former head of Ecomog, the west African intervention force in Sierra Leone which worked with the UN for six months, Major General Gabriel Kpamber; and the deputy force commander, Brigadier-General Mohammed Garba, who is Gen Jetley's immediate subordinate. The report lays bare the personal animosity between Gen Jetley and the men he accuses, but it goes further by detailing a series of actions that he says amount to collusion with the rebels to wreck last year's peace accords because Nigeria wants a free hand to run Sierra Leone and its army wants to control the diamond trade. At the heart of the accusations lie charges that the Nigerians compromised Gen Jetley's efforts to free 500 of his peacekeepers taken hostage by the RUF in May.</p> <p>\"The mission directive given to me and which I tried to follow implicitly, directly conflicted with the interests of not only the warring factions but also of the major players in the diamond racket like Liberia and Nigeria.</p> <p>\"As an Indian, and having no hidden agenda to promote, I became a victim of the machinations of these countries. By placing their stooges in the right places they have not only tried to scuttle the peace process but also try and denigrate me and the country I represent, to promote their own personal ambitions and personal interests.</p> <p>\"It is my opinion that the Ecomog force commander along with the SRSG [Mr Adeniji] and DFC [Gen Garba] have worked hard to sabotage the peace process and show Indians in general and me in particular in a poor light... Keeping the Nigerian interests was paramount even if it meant scuttling the peace process and this also implied that Unamsil [the UN force] was expendable.</p> <p>\"To this end the SRSG and DFC cultivated the RUF leadership especially Foday Sankoh behind my back.\"</p> <p>But the report came as no surprise to western and senior UN officials who say that there is ample evidence that the Nigerian army remains heavily implicated in the illegal diamond trade, that its senior officers worked closely with the RUF despite having also fought it, and that the Nigerians believe that, as the largest troop contingent in the UN mission, they should have overall command.</p> <p>Gen Jetley argues that senior Nigerian army officers - particularly Gen Kpamber and Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe, who died earlier this year - did not want to withdraw from Sierra Leone because they were making huge amounts of money from illegal diamond mining and payments from the RUF.</p> <p>\"It is well known that public opinion in Nigeria was against the continued deployment of Nigerian troops as part of Ecomog in Sierra Leone, however the Nigerian army was interested in staying in Sierra Leone due to the benefits they were getting from the illegal mining. Gen Khobe was known as the 'Ten Million man', it is alleged that he received up to $10m to permit the activities of RUF. The Ecomog force commander Gen Kpamber was also involved in the illegal diamond mining in connivance with RUF leader Foday Sankoh,\" Gen Jetley wrote.</p> <p>In January, Gen Kpamber astonished a meeting of regional heads of state on the peace process by praising Mr Sankoh as the \"saviour of the nation\". The two men were often seen in each other's company travelling to diamond towns from which the UN was barred. Sierra Leoneans referred to Gen Kpamber as \"Sankoh's ADC\".</p> <p>Gen Jetley lists a series of actions by the Nigerian army which he concludes amounted to colluding in the abductions. He notes that while Kenyans, Zambians and Indians were taken captive, the rebels let the Nigerians go.</p> <p>But the alleged relationship between Mr Sankoh and senior Nigerian officers and officials would explain why the rebel leader was trying to get to the Nigerian High Commission when he was captured. Gen Jetley blames low morale for the mass surrender of his troops.</p>",

At the heart of the accusations lie charges that the Nigerians compromised Gen Jetley's efforts to free 500 of his peacekeepers taken hostage by the RUF in May. \"The mission directive given to me and which I tried to follow implicitly, directly conflicted with the interests of not only the warring factions but also of the major players in the diamond racket like Liberia and Nigeria. \"As an Indian, and having no hidden agenda to promote, I became a victim of the machinations of these countries. By placing their stooges in the right places they have not only tried to scuttle the peace process but also try and denigrate me and the country I represent, to promote their own personal ambitions and personal interests. \"It is my opinion that the Ecomog force commander along with the SRSG [Mr Adeniji] and DFC [Gen Garba] have worked hard to sabotage the peace process and show Indians in general and me in particular in a poor light... Keeping the Nigerian interests was paramount even if it meant scuttling the peace process and this also implied that Unamsil [the UN force] was expendable. \"To this end the SRSG and DFC cultivated the RUF leadership especially Foday Sankoh behind my back.\" But the report came as no surprise to western and senior UN officials who say that there is ample evidence that the Nigerian army remains heavily implicated in the illegal diamond trade, that its senior officers worked closely with the RUF despite having also fought it, and that the Nigerians believe that, as the largest troop contingent in the UN mission, they should have overall command. Gen Jetley argues that senior Nigerian army officers - particularly Gen Kpamber and Brigadier-General Maxwell Khobe, who died earlier this year - did not want to withdraw from Sierra Leone because they were making huge amounts of money from illegal diamond mining and payments from the RUF. \"It is well known that public opinion in Nigeria was against the continued deployment of Nigerian troops as part of Ecomog in Sierra Leone, however the Nigerian army was interested in staying in Sierra Leone due to the benefits they were getting from the illegal mining. Gen Khobe was known as the 'Ten Million man', it is alleged that he received up to $10m to permit the activities of RUF. The Ecomog force commander Gen Kpamber was also involved in the illegal diamond mining in connivance with RUF leader Foday Sankoh,\" Gen Jetley wrote. In January, Gen Kpamber astonished a meeting of regional heads of state on the peace process by praising Mr Sankoh as the \"saviour of the nation\". The two men were often seen in each other's company travelling to diamond towns from which the UN was barred. Sierra Leoneans referred to Gen Kpamber as \"Sankoh's ADC\". Gen Jetley lists a series of actions by the Nigerian army which he concludes amounted to colluding in the abductions. He notes that while Kenyans, Zambians and Indians were taken captive, the rebels let the Nigerians go. But the alleged relationship between Mr Sankoh and senior Nigerian officers and officials would explain why the rebel leader was trying to get to the Nigerian High Commission when he was captured. Gen Jetley blames low morale for the mass surrender of his troops.",

The UNDP runs on a shoestring compared to resources available to the bank and the fund. Its core budget this year was $700m - less than what the bank spends on administration - although with the extra resources it mobilises the overall total rises to about $2.5bn. The bank's lending programme, by contrast, totals $7bn. </p> <p>\"It's all got there by a wing and a prayer,\" says Malloch Brown. In fact, the budget has been declining over the past decade from a peak in 1992 of $1.2bn. The UNDP has been a victim of the aid fatigue which hit the main donors after the collapse of the Iron Curtain removed the political justifications for many countries' lending programmes. </p> <p>But it has also been a victim of its own reputation for inefficiency and waste. Britain is one of the leading donors which has refused until recently to increase its allocation for the UNDP until it sees evidence that the money is being well spent. </p> <p>A British national with a long track record in the international system - he worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the early 1980s - Malloch Brown came to the UNDP at the request of the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, to shake up the place and be part of Annan's reforming agenda which was showcased at this week's millennium summit. </p> <p>But Malloch Brown was received initially with suspicion. Some poor countries believed he had been chosen to smuggle a bank perspective into an institution which has always been seen as an ally of the developing world. While the World Bank and IMF are under the thumb of the donor countries - the Group of Seven leading industrialised economies controls nearly half of the votes on the fund's management board - the UNDP has always been much closer to the recipients of aid. </p> <p>Malloch Brown freely admits he preaches the bank's line about the need to accompany aid with political and economic reform and he deliberately set out turn the UNDP's focus to the importance of good governance. It was a message not universally popular with aid recipients unaccustomed to receiving lectures on reform from their friends at the UNDP. </p> <p>\"In the first six months I had a bit of rough ride because I said governance ought to be our priority. There was a lot of initial caution, the developing country representatives in New York said 'oh my God, he's another part of this secret political version of the Washington consensus'.\" </p> <p>For some developing country governments the strings which come attached to aid programmes these days, requiring them to consult with their electorates, are seen as a new form of political structural adjustment. </p> <p>But the initial concern has dissipated, according to Malloch Brown, as poor countries have come to realise that they need to change. They would still rather hear the message from the UNDP, however, than endure the more heavy handed approach of the bank or the fund. </p> <p>Malloch Brown's belief in the importance of democratic reforms comes from his time at the UNHCR during the late 1970s, which convinced him that the root of all problems in developing countries was a lack of democracy. </p> <p>\"If you have a competitive political system in which to resolve differences, you won't have refugee flows,\" he says. </p> <p>It was also the spur behind the next stage of his varied career, his work as a political consultant for various developing country governments in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </p> <p>He describes himself then as a \"mercenary for democracy\", and he and his colleagues chalked up some impressive victories, including Corrie Aquino's election campaign in the Philippines in 1986 and the no vote in the Chilean referendum of 1988 which eventually ended General Pinochet's rule. </p> <p>The wave of fledgling democratic governments which came to power in the 1980s were ripe for advice from Malloch Brown's consultancy with its sophisticated polling techniques and understanding of political systems. He learnt a lot, as well, along the way. </p> <p>\"A lot of these nice phrases about local ownership in the development community I learnt at the political coalface.\" </p> <p><strong> 'In the wrong business'</strong><br> </p> <p> Malloch Brown sees his role at the UNDP as the culmination of his previous experience. The organisation clearly needs a PR overhaul to restore donors' confidence, but at the same time he has to go gently to avoid alienating the trust of the developing countries, which is its biggest asset. </p> <p>The old-style UNDP ran thousands of small development projects and had a reputation for being bureaucratic and inefficient. Malloch Brown thinks the project-based approach is a waste of time when its resources are dwarfed by other aid agencies. </p> <p>\"UNDP was in the wrong business, we didn't offer any value added,\" he says. \"In a tight market for official development assistance we were going nowhere.\" </p> <p>The plan now is to reposition the UNDP as an advisory and advocacy agency. That is not, he hastens to add, because advice is cheap, although that is an advantage, but because \"if you look at the environment in which we are operating, advice is a scarce commodity\". </p> <p>In fact, turning the UNDP into an advisory body will bring it once again into competition with the bank, which is also championing the governance agenda. His old boss, James Wolfensohn, has been trying to reposition his institution as the \"listening bank\". </p> <p>But in a head-to-head battle over who should be the prime source of advice to the developing world the UNDP has many advantages. </p> <p>While the bank is handicapped by the perception that it is in the pocket of the G7, the UNDP can capitalise on trust. \"I'm stunned by the freedom I have to raise issues with governments,\" says Malloch Brown. </p> <p>The backlash against globalisation which started in Seattle last December has also benefited the UNDP. \"The Seattle aftershocks which have driven the developing countries back to us made them more cautious and anxious to find an alternative path.\" </p> <p>Malloch Brown is no advocate of stopping the processes of economic integration, however. </p> <p>\"Globalisation is inevitable: the question is on what terms,\" he says. \"We have to make sure that poor people are included in the process.\"</p>",

In fact, the budget has been declining over the past decade from a peak in 1992 of $1.2bn. The UNDP has been a victim of the aid fatigue which hit the main donors after the collapse of the Iron Curtain removed the political justifications for many countries' lending programmes. But it has also been a victim of its own reputation for inefficiency and waste. Britain is one of the leading donors which has refused until recently to increase its allocation for the UNDP until it sees evidence that the money is being well spent. A British national with a long track record in the international system - he worked for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in the early 1980s - Malloch Brown came to the UNDP at the request of the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, to shake up the place and be part of Annan's reforming agenda which was showcased at this week's millennium summit. But Malloch Brown was received initially with suspicion. Some poor countries believed he had been chosen to smuggle a bank perspective into an institution which has always been seen as an ally of the developing world. While the World Bank and IMF are under the thumb of the donor countries - the Group of Seven leading industrialised economies controls nearly half of the votes on the fund's management board - the UNDP has always been much closer to the recipients of aid. Malloch Brown freely admits he preaches the bank's line about the need to accompany aid with political and economic reform and he deliberately set out turn the UNDP's focus to the importance of good governance. It was a message not universally popular with aid recipients unaccustomed to receiving lectures on reform from their friends at the UNDP. \"In the first six months I had a bit of rough ride because I said governance ought to be our priority. There was a lot of initial caution, the developing country representatives in New York said 'oh my God, he's another part of this secret political version of the Washington consensus'.\" For some developing country governments the strings which come attached to aid programmes these days, requiring them to consult with their electorates, are seen as a new form of political structural adjustment. But the initial concern has dissipated, according to Malloch Brown, as poor countries have come to realise that they need to change. They would still rather hear the message from the UNDP, however, than endure the more heavy handed approach of the bank or the fund. Malloch Brown's belief in the importance of democratic reforms comes from his time at the UNHCR during the late 1970s, which convinced him that the root of all problems in developing countries was a lack of democracy. \"If you have a competitive political system in which to resolve differences, you won't have refugee flows,\" he says. It was also the spur behind the next stage of his varied career, his work as a political consultant for various developing country governments in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He describes himself then as a \"mercenary for democracy\", and he and his colleagues chalked up some impressive victories, including Corrie Aquino's election campaign in the Philippines in 1986 and the no vote in the Chilean referendum of 1988 which eventually ended General Pinochet's rule. The wave of fledgling democratic governments which came to power in the 1980s were ripe for advice from Malloch Brown's consultancy with its sophisticated polling techniques and understanding of political systems. He learnt a lot, as well, along the way. \"A lot of these nice phrases about local ownership in the development community I learnt at the political coalface.\" 'In the wrong business' Malloch Brown sees his role at the UNDP as the culmination of his previous experience. The organisation clearly needs a PR overhaul to restore donors' confidence, but at the same time he has to go gently to avoid alienating the trust of the developing countries, which is its biggest asset. The old-style UNDP ran thousands of small development projects and had a reputation for being bureaucratic and inefficient. Malloch Brown thinks the project-based approach is a waste of time when its resources are dwarfed by other aid agencies. \"UNDP was in the wrong business, we didn't offer any value added,\" he says. \"In a tight market for official development assistance we were going nowhere.\" The plan now is to reposition the UNDP as an advisory and advocacy agency. That is not, he hastens to add, because advice is cheap, although that is an advantage, but because \"if you look at the environment in which we are operating, advice is a scarce commodity\". In fact, turning the UNDP into an advisory body will bring it once again into competition with the bank, which is also championing the governance agenda. His old boss, James Wolfensohn, has been trying to reposition his institution as the \"listening bank\". But in a head-to-head battle over who should be the prime source of advice to the developing world the UNDP has many advantages. While the bank is handicapped by the perception that it is in the pocket of the G7, the UNDP can capitalise on trust. \"I'm stunned by the freedom I have to raise issues with governments,\" says Malloch Brown. The backlash against globalisation which started in Seattle last December has also benefited the UNDP. \"The Seattle aftershocks which have driven the developing countries back to us made them more cautious and anxious to find an alternative path.\" Malloch Brown is no advocate of stopping the processes of economic integration, however. \"Globalisation is inevitable: the question is on what terms,\" he says. \"We have to make sure that poor people are included in the process.\"",

      "bodyText": "Property experts gave a mixed response to the recent publication of the government's plans for leasehold reform in England and Wales. While ministers presented the draft bill as the answer to leaseholders' prayers, critics said the proposals stopped short of freeing flat owners from the clutches of greedy freeholders. Closer inspection of the documents reveals that how much owners of leasehold flats and houses benefit from the changes depends upon their particular situation. To test the likely impact of the changes on individuals, Jobs &amp; Money asked property expert Paul Brecknell at solicitors Withers to outline how much of a difference the draft proposals would make when implemented to three hypothetical leaseholders wrestling with common problems. 1 The residents of a Victorian building containing two flats have an absentee landlord. He refuses to properly maintain the outside of the building. Every now and again they are sent bills for work that hasn't been carried out. They are tired of chasing him up with fruitless phone calls. What could they do now? Assuming that the landlord has responsibility for repair of the exterior as is generally the case, the leaseholders could apply to the county court requesting that it appoint a manager under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. If the court is satisfied that there has been default on the part of the landlord, it will appoint a suitable managing agent to collect the service charges and carry out the landlord's obligations. The alternative would be to buy the freehold if both leaseholders agreed to do so and could afford it. This will also involve an application to the county court with the same documentation that would normally apply to a compulsory purchase by the leaseholders of the freehold. The court will have to be satisfied that at least one leaseholder has lived in his or her flat for the past 12 months or for three years out of the past 10 years. The price payable will be independently established by a valuer and the money paid into court for the landlord. Of course, if the leaseholders can track down the landlord, they can suggest he appoint a managing agent to manage because he can recover the costs from the leaseholders and it won't cost him anything. Failing his agreeing to that, they can take him to court and force him to carry out his obligations. What could they do if the reforms are implemented? The most obvious solution to the leaseholders' problems would be to take advantage of the new right to manage. This is a right for the leaseholders themselves to manage, rather than someone appointed by the court. The application procedure is similar to that which is applied to the compulsory purchase of the freehold. By taking over the management of the building the leaseholders will be able to administer their own service charges, although the landlord will still have a say in the management of the building by virtue of having voting rights in the management company. The government's proposals in relation to the number of votes the landlord would get in this situation have not yet been fully formulated. However, in this case it seems likely that the leaseholders would have effective control of the management company even in the unlikely event that the absentee landlord popped up and voted. 2 Two leasehold flats are above a leasehold shop. Once again, the freeholder is absent and refuses to maintain the building. The leaseholders do bits and pieces, but the shop leaseholder refuses to contribute because he doesn't live there. What could they do now? The shop owner's lease will generally contain some service charge provisions but these apply only to costs incurred by the landlord. The leaseholders cannot there fore recover any part of the monies they have spent. The most obvious solution here would again be to apply for the appointment of a manager under the 1987 Act to carry out the landlord's function. What could they do if the reforms are implemented? Again, the most obvious solution would be to exercise the right to manage. This should allow the leaseholders to take control but a note of caution should once more be sounded in relation to the voting rights in the management company. The leaseholders would only be able to buy the freehold if the shop premises do not represent more than 25% of the overall internal floor area of the building. However, even if the compulsory purchase of the freehold is possible, it is unlikely that the leaseholders would want to buy the landlord's interest in the shop and end up as the owners of the freehold reversion to that shop. It may, therefore, be preferable to rely on the 1987 Act right and seek the appointment of a manager under current law. 3 Leaseholders in a block of 30 flats receive frequent demands from their freeholder for maintenance payments. Work has been done but it is sub-standard. The flat owners have got together to write letters demanding to see the accounts but to no avail. They are withholding payments and the freeholder has threatened them with court action. What could they do now? The landlord will only be able to require payment if he has complied with the consultation procedures laid down by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. Moreover under the 1985 Act, service charges can only be recovered to the extent that they relate to works of a reasonable standard. The leaseholders could therefore refer the dispute to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. As mentioned, under the current law the landlord cannot seek to forfeit the lease (bring it to an end) without first taking the dispute to the tribunal for resolution, but the landlord could make a claim for the sums owed in the county court. There is no award of costs in the tribunal but split between a majority of the leaseholders, this would probably be the most economic remedy. If the landlord were to take the matter to the county court and obtain a judgment to recover any charges at all then the leaseholders could be required to pay some or all of the landlord's costs. The leaseholders should not withhold payment of all service charges if some are properly due. If they have a good idea of the value of the defective works, they could withhold that element of the charges. This should protect them from an adverse costs order. Although the leaseholders are demanding to see the accounts, they are only currently entitled to a costs summary certified by an accountant. That would only appear once the year's service charge accounts have been finalised. That could be anything up to 18 months after the costs have occurred. The certification is limited and should not be confused with an audit. The leaseholders do have the right to inspect and copy the accounts, invoices, etc. that support the costs summary and the landlord must comply with a request to inspect within one month. If the landlord won't oblige, it will be necessary to threaten an application to the court for an order - naturally to include a claim for costs. What could they do if the reforms are implemented? The landlord could be required to get an accountant to explain what certification actually involves. One of the leaseholders may have the right to inspect at any time within 21 days of a request to do so. There may also be a right to withhold payments up to a certain level when a landlord has failed to provide the information required to by law.

The cash, shares and loan notes deal will double Mazaran's size and complement its six largely southern-based health clubs.

But the first man is lying on top of the second and moving him would inevitably hasten his death.</p> <p>What should the doctor do? Would it be right for him to move the first man even though this would accelerate his death in order to save the life of the second? Does he have the right to choose to save one life though his actions would harm a second?</p> <p>This is the sort of dilemma - taking in complex legal, moral and ethical issues - which the lawyers embroiled in the case of conjoined twins Jodie and Mary have been confronting as they frame arguments for and against the separation operation which would save one of the girls but kill the other.</p> <p>At one level, the case is a heartbreaking human story. It is impossible to imagine the torment of the girls' parents whose Roman Catholic beliefs mean that they cannot give permission for a procedure which would bring about the death of Mary, only kept alive by the oxygenated blood she receives from her sister. On another level, the case has raised a series of profound questions which are troubling some of Britain's sharpest legal minds and most serious moral and religious thinkers.</p> <p>Ultimately, the case could have implications about the way the courts and society at large look at fundamental life and death issues.</p> <p>This weekend a team of eminent lawyers will be attempting, at the behest of the attorney general, to pin down one of the central legal problems of the case - whether the separation will constitute a criminal offence.</p> <p>If, when the appeal recommences on Wednesday, a definitive argument concludes that the operation could be judged as murder or manslaughter, then the job of the three judges becomes infinitely more straightforward.</p> <p>The courts cannot authorise a step which would \"actively terminate a life\" - even to relieve misery and even if the patient or a parent consents. Life can never be terminated by a positive action, such as an injection, but only by the withdrawal of treatment or food.</p> <p>In the original high court ruling which gave doctors the go-ahead to carry out the separation, Mr Justice Johnson based his judgement on the assertion that Mary's death would be caused by the interruption or withdrawal of the blood supply. This could be compared to the withholding of nourishment, as in the case of Hillsborough football disaster survivor Tony Bland, who spent almost four years in a persistent vegetative state before a ruling that doctors would not be acting unlawfully if they stopped feeding him by tube.</p> <p>From the start of the appeal, the issue of lawfulness has been central. Lord Justice Brooke, a former chairman of the law commission, described the criminal law aspects of the case as \"astonishingly difficult\". In one of the most dramatic moments of the case, he brandished a photograph of the girls and asked how a separation could be carried out without a criminal assault on Mary.</p> <p>The judges also raised the possibility that a crime might be committed if an operation took place because it would lead to Mary's death - or if it did not because this would lead to Jodie's death. If the twins remained conjoined, doctors believe both will die within six months.</p> <p>Entwined in this legal argument is the most difficult moral issue. Can it ever be right for a doctor to save one life at the expense of another?</p> <p>Ethicists believe the problem can be approached in two ways. A utilitarian approach is that it is better to save one life even at the cost of another. The absolutist approach - as put forward by the parents and largely backed by Catholic thinkers - is that it can never be right to sacrifice a life.</p> <p>The Archbishop of Westminster Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, said: \"There is a fundamental moral principle at stake - no one may commit a wrong action that good may come of it. The parents in this case have made it clear that they love both their children equally and cannot consent to one of them being killed to help the other. I believe this moral instinct is right. It would set a very dangerous precedent to enshrine in English case law that it was ever right to kill a person that good may come of it.\"</p> <p>In 1993 doctors at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia faced a similar quandary over whether to separate conjoined twins Amy and Angela Lakeberg. Doctors said the twins would die within weeks if they were not separated but also knew the operation would result in Amy's death. The parents agreed to the operation and Angela survived for 10 months.</p> <p>The case sparked a national debate. Alice Dreger, an historian of anatomy at the Michi gan State University, was one of those who forcefully put forward the argument that if the twins had been born separate and the health of both was failing, nobody would have suggested that one sickly twin should be killed and her organs taken for the sake of the other.</p> <p>David Thomasma, professor of medical ethics at Chicago's Loyola University Medical Centre, also studied the moral implications of the Lakeberg case. He said: \"I remember during the debate how quickly people who wanted to intervene could move into the idea that one twin was like a parasite or an appendage - language that makes one morally able to divide them.\"</p> <p>In former times, conjoined twins were often used at funfair freak shows. Even today the way they should be regarded remains unclear. During the appeal, Lord Justice Ward put the problem in stark terms when he asked if Jodie and Mary were individuals or the \"more horrifying concept\" of one person with two heads.</p> <p>At another point his comments echoed the idea of the weaker of the twins being a parasite when he said: \"She's hooked into her sister, draining her sister's life blood from her and will eventually kill her.\"</p> <p>If they could be treated as a single entity, it might have made the decision easier: an operation to separate Mary from Jodie could have been compared to a procedure to remove a diseased limb threatening a whole body.</p> <p>At first glance the law concerning the parents seems more straightforward. While \"great weight\" has to be attached to their wishes, the court has a duty to ignore them in the best interests of the child.</p> <p>But Richard Nicholson, editor of the Bulletin of Medical Ethics, suggested that the judges in this instance simply could not make the decision. \"In a situation like this when there isn't an obvious right answer, do we not need to put the onus for the decision back on to those for whom it will mean the most, those who are going to have to live with the consequences of the decision? Surely we have to give great power and credence to the parents?\"</p> <p>A complicating factor here is the extraordinary circumstances which have resulted in the case being heard before a British court. The parents come from a remote, unidentified European community with different customs and values to Britain's. They are here because their government has an agreement with Britain that a certain number of people can be treated within the NHS.</p> <p>Presumably their case would be treated differently if they came before the courts in their own country. But legal experts believe that any efforts by the parents to leave - not that there has been a suggestion that they have tried to - could result in the twins being made wards of court. In effect they are trapped.</p> <p>And so to the inevitable question of religion. In another dramatic courtroom moment, Lord Justice Ward suggested that it could not be \"God's will\" that Mary survive because she had not been born with the capacity for independent life. The parents' position remains that it is not \"God's will\" that people terminate life.</p> <p>Much of modern British criminal law - which will be the subject of microscopic examination this weekend by those who will be representing the attorney general on Wednesday - is based on 19th-century case law made by judges basing their conclusions on Judaeo-Christian principles.</p> <p>The thorny question of whether Mary was a \"viable\" being has also been addressed. If she had not been connected to Jodie she would have died because she lacked a functioning heart or lungs.</p> <p>The judges queried whether Mary had in fact been \"born alive\" given the fact that she depended on her twin for her very life breath.</p> <p>Pro life campaigners are appalled at the notion that Mary might not be considered to have been born alive, pointing out that a decision which would lead to her death could be the thin end of a terrifying wedge. Could a ruling which called into question Mary's very right to be thought of as a human being have implications for severely disabled people?</p> <p>Helen Watt, research fellow at the Linacre Centre for Healthcare Ethics, said: \"Medicine is all about supporting ill people. There are disabled people all over the country who without medical help would die. Are they all non-persons?\"</p> <p>But is Mary's life worthwhile? Technological advances, of course, mean that increasingly patients can be kept alive even when in many eyes death would be preferable.</p> <p>Former master of the rolls Lord Donaldson ruled that a \"balancing exercise\" was needed. There was a \"strong presumption\" in a course of action which would prolong life but said it was not \"irrebuttable\". Account had to be taken of the pain, suffering and quality of life which a child would experience if life was prolonged.</p> <p>Counsel on behalf of Mary insisted that the sanctity of life - again a phrase with religious resonances - meant that there was a powerful argument for her to be kept alive in the absence of the lack of proof that she was in pain.</p> <p>The ethicists point out in a secular society whose people do not believe in a life after death, the fact of physical existence becomes ever more important and the efforts of doctors are concentrated ever more on keeping life going no matter what.</p> <p>When those decisions are opposed by parents who do have a strong faith - and have to be ratified in a court whose laws are based on religious principles - there is bound to be a clash.</p> <p><b>Battle to discard 'circus act' description of babies</b> <br> <b>Raekha Prasad</b></p> <p>In Italy they are gemelli siamesi ; the French call them fr\u00e8res siamois or soeurs siamoises ; and in Spanish they are hermanos siameses or hermanas siamesas . Even the Thais - who no longer refer to their country as Siam - use the term to describe twins whose bodies are joined.</p> <p>Although it is being used to describe the case of Mary and Jodie, a spokesman for Great Ormond Street children's hospital, said: \"'Siamese twins' is not used by anyone in the hospital. We consider it inaccurate and patronising, unless the twins are actually from Thailand. We have had a small battle since the beginning of this story to correct the term.\"</p> <p>It comes from Chang and Eng Bunker, born joined at the chest in Thailand in 1811. They became a US circus act.</p> <p>Harvey Marcovitch, a consultant paediatrician and editor of the journal of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the term had not been used in medical circles for at least 20 years; the profession used it only when talking to lay people. Conjoined was used instead.</p> <p>In the 1960s the term spastic was not considered pejorative. It became cerebral palsy and is now neuron-impaired. Until the second world war, it was acceptable to call people with learning disabilities morons and idiots. By the 1970s the preferred term was educationally subnormal. By the 1980s it had changed to learning disabilities, and now one term used is special needs.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com</a> Conjoined Twins <a href=\"http://www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm</a> Twin Stuff: conjoined twins</p>",

When those decisions are opposed by parents who do have a strong faith - and have to be ratified in a court whose laws are based on religious principles - there is bound to be a clash. Battle to discard 'circus act' description of babies Raekha Prasad In Italy they are gemelli siamesi ; the French call them fr\u00e8res siamois or soeurs siamoises ; and in Spanish they are hermanos siameses or hermanas siamesas . Even the Thais - who no longer refer to their country as Siam - use the term to describe twins whose bodies are joined. Although it is being used to describe the case of Mary and Jodie, a spokesman for Great Ormond Street children's hospital, said: \"'Siamese twins' is not used by anyone in the hospital. We consider it inaccurate and patronising, unless the twins are actually from Thailand. We have had a small battle since the beginning of this story to correct the term.\" It comes from Chang and Eng Bunker, born joined at the chest in Thailand in 1811. They became a US circus act. Harvey Marcovitch, a consultant paediatrician and editor of the journal of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the term had not been used in medical circles for at least 20 years; the profession used it only when talking to lay people. Conjoined was used instead. In the 1960s the term spastic was not considered pejorative. It became cerebral palsy and is now neuron-impaired. Until the second world war, it was acceptable to call people with learning disabilities morons and idiots. By the 1970s the preferred term was educationally subnormal. By the 1980s it had changed to learning disabilities, and now one term used is special needs. www.conjoined-twins.i-p.com Conjoined Twins www.twinstuff.com/conjoined.htm Twin Stuff: conjoined twins",

      "bodyText": "Eleven residents of a small village in Indonesian West Timor were murdered on Thursday by a rampaging mob, the Indonesian military confirmed yesterday. Unnamed UN sources in the East Timorese capital, Dili, said the death toll was 20 but they refused to give details and the reports could not be confirmed. It is thought that the perpetrators were pro-Jakarta militiamen linked to the group that killed three UN workers in the nearby town of Atambua the previous day. As militiamen continued house-to-house searches and set up roadblocks across West Timor in a bid to find anyone linked to international humanitarian organisations, the UN completed its airlift of approximately 300 foreign and local employees of international organisations that have been working in West Timor. Major-General Kiki Syahnakri, Indonesia's regional commander covering West Timor, told UN officials that the massacre occurred in the village of Bese Kama, a few miles from the border with East Timor. He claimed that it happened during a clash between local people and some of the tens of thousands of East Timorese refugees living in the area. \"Kiki said the locals were driven from their homes in the chaos,\" said Jake Morland, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for refugees West Timor operation, who is now in Bali. \"Indonesian soldiers guarding the border with East Timor left their posts and went to the village to restore order. It was as they were doing that that they discovered the bodies.\" Neither the victims' identities nor ages were released. While the Indonesian Army is blaming the East Timorese refugees, the UN believes it is the militia living among the refugees who are responsible for the current violence. Bese Kama is an area where the UNHCR has been unable to operate since July because of threats and violence against its staff. After its office in the nearest town, Betum, was stoned seven weeks ago the staff were pulled out and have not been back since. A police intelligence sergeant in Atambua said yesterday: \"The militia are in complete control in many areas around Betum. We are waiting for more reinforcements before we can even attempt to restore law and order.\" There are more than 2,500 Indonesian police and soldiers currently in West Timor but they appear to be having little impact on the militia. \"The militia are moving around West Timor with impunity,\" Mr Morland said. \"They are going from house to house searching for anyone who has had links to us or our partner organisations.\" The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the militia are not a homogeneous force, but disparate rumps of various paramilitary groups that existed in East Timor before the independence referendum just over a year ago.

      "bodyText": "A senior policeman alleged to have been \"unable to control his sexual behaviour\" was cleared yesterday of sexually assaulting two women. Ian Beckett, deputy chief constable of Surrey police, had denied charges of indecently assaulting the two civilian workers at the force's headquarters in Guildford in December 1998. After the jury at Southwark crown court returned the not guilty verdicts, it was revealed that Mr Beckett had tried to kill himself last March by taking an overdose of pills. The prosecution had accused Mr Beckett, 54, of subjecting the women, who cannot be named, to \"humiliating and degrading\" ordeals. One told the jury of first being hugged in his locked and darkened office and on a later occasion being forced to endure him touching her private parts after he asked her to wear red underwear for him as a \"Christmas treat\". The other woman said Mr Beckett, a father of two from Chertsey, Surrey, put his hand up her skirt to touch the top of her thigh in an initial attack, before kissing her and fondling one of her breasts in a follow-up assault. Later, she alleged he repeatedly asked her to let him make love to her. But the jury took just over five-hours to clear him of four counts of indecency. In his defence, Mr Beckett had claimed he was the victim of \"lies and fantasy\". As the not guilty verdicts were returned, Mr Beckett, who has been suspended on full pay since January last year, smiled. Gaynor, his wife of 33 years who was in the court throughout the trial, burst into tears and hugged him. Sallie Bennett-Jenkins, prosecuting, told the jury that Mr Beckett regarded himself as the \"top dog\" as he \"abused his position to carry out sexual assaults of increasing gravity\". She claimed the \"first rate\" officer had \"taken advantage of his position to intimidate and humiliate the two women and subject them to quite appalling behaviour\". The jury was told that Mr Beckett was \"unable to control his sexual behaviour\". After his acquittal, Mr Beckett's solicitor, Peter Williams, read a statement on his behalf: \"I and my family are relieved the right verdict was reached in a case which has caused us enormous trauma. \"I now ask that we might return to the privacy and dignity of my family life. And of course I'm looking forward to returning to Surrey police as its committed deputy chief constable.\" The court heard that when interviewed by City of London officers about the women's claims, Mr Beckett said they could be connected to the fact that he had disciplined two of their friends after an incident with a pornographic email. Mr Beckett also branded one of his accusers - known only as Mrs X - as a \"very, very unhappy\" woman who was both incompetent and a liar. The Surrey police authority will meet on Monday to discuss whether Mr Beckett, who is still suspended from duty, will keep his job. Its chairman, Alan Peirce, said: \"Other disciplinary matters, not the subject of the criminal trial, may have been committed.\" Referring to the possible disciplinary hearing against Mr Beckett, Denis O'Connor, chief constable of Surrey, said: \"I am aware of three other issues raised by other individuals ... the matters involved are matters to some degree similar.\" Regarding the two women who gave evidence during the trial, he said: \"Both women do work for Surrey police and we have supported them throughout and will continue to do so.\"",

      "bodyText": "Japan was shaken by its biggest spy scandal in 20 years and Moscow exposed to public embarrassment when police seized a senior Japanese officer yesterday on suspicion of leaking confidential documents to a Russian military attache suspected of working for his country's secret service. The unexpected flashback to the cold war prompted an angry exchange of accusations between Tokyo and Moscow, just three days after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ended his first official visit to Tokyo by rejecting Japanese claims to four disputed islands. With that in mind, Japan's choice of this moment to swoop on the naval officer and a Russian diplomatic contact may not be entirely coincidental. Their relationship had been monitored for some time, according to the authorities. Police said that they caught Shigehiro Hagisaki, 38, who worked as a researcher at the national institute for defence studies and held the rank of lieutenant-commander, as he was passing secret papers to a Russian military attache in a restaurant in Tokyo. According to the state-owned television channel NHK, the attache, Victor Bogatenkov, 44, is a member of the GRU, the intelligence service which replaced the KGB after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Mr Bogatenkov has claimed diplomatic immunity from questioning and arrest. Detectives are reported to have watched the two men exchange envelopes at about 10 meetings in the past year at Chinese restaurants and at bars. Mr Hagisaki is said by the authorities to have admitted supplying information in return for money. The extent of the leak remains unclear. Mr Hagisaki worked in the documents division of Japan's navy, known as the maritime self-defence forces because the country's post-war constitution restricts it from formally having offensive military capabilities. He is believed to have had access to sensitive information about his country's submarine forces and about security cooperation with other states. Embarrassingly for the government, police allege that in searches of the suspect's house and office they found files on the US navy. Washington is Tokyo's main ally. \"This incident invites mis trust about Japan's defence arrangments both at home and overseas,\" said Hidenao Nakagawa, the government's main spokesman. The defence minister, Toshio Torashima, said the accused officer's actions were \"unforgiveable\" and said a complaint would be lodged with Russia once the details of the case were clarified. But in Moscow a government spokesman took a pugnacious tone, calling the arrest unfriendly and provocative. \"Japan, unfortunately, has forces that want to turn the clock backwards because they are unhappy at the radical improvement in bilateral relations,\" said an official quoted by the news agency Itar-Tass. Tokyo and Moscow have yet to sign a peace treaty more than 55 years after the end of the second world war because of a sovereignty dispute over the Kurile islands to the north of Japan that were seized by Soviet troops in 1945. Three years ago, when relations were warming, the two countries's leaders pledged to work towards settling this problem by the end of 2000. Earlier this week, however, Mr Putin turned down a compromise by the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, who suggested Moscow could cede administrative control in return for agreed sovereignty. This rejection killed off any chance of agreement by the end-of-year deadline. The two leaders parted with public smiles and promises to cooperate more on regional security, but the lack of progress was a huge disappointment for many in Japan.",

Angry young man, mid-life crisis, cultural Jeremiah between the dangerous years of 61 and 66 - there is always a lazy (ageist) epithet available to ho-ho away the serious implications of what actually is being argued. \"We're in the middle of a grumpfest.\" (Oh, the wit of the man.) I've not read the books by Tusa, Drummond, Walden &amp; Wogan - all of which sound urgent and interesting, despite the silly disparagements (I know I shouldn't be writing this, but please don't hurt me when it's my turn next). I have, however, read Michael Kustow's book culture@risk, which far from being a Jeremiah is a vivid report from the front line, a crackling collage of accounts and critiques, profiles and testimony of some of the leading theatre-makers in the world, written by a generous spirit who opens himself to the talents of others - rare in these sour isles. 80% of the book is taken up with enthusiasms; why does Sutherland chose to dwell on the other 20% which seriously and persuasively argues how such talent is under threat?

The Jakarta parliament, where Mr Wahid's grip is also tenuous, has meanwhile passed a constitutional amendment allowing the granting of retrospective amnesties for rights abuses.

      "bodyText": "Manchester United footballers such as David Beckham and Roy Keane could be awarded share options in the club worth around \u00a310m each as part of a possible plan to stop them being poached by the club's big spending foreign rivals. The prospect of multi-million pound share bonuses - more usually associated with city investment bankers and dot.com entrepreneurs - was raised yesterday after the United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, was quoted in a fanzine as saying that the plan was being considered to combat spiralling player wages and transfer fees. A spokesman for the club later insisted there were no share option plans in place, but a number of advisers to United said it was \"an excellent idea\". The world's richest football club has at times found it difficult to compete in the transfer market because the strict rules that come with its status on the London stock exchange prevent it splashing out huge sums on players. Spanish rivals Real Madrid recently spent a world record \u00a343m on Portuguese striker Luis Figo but then warned that its lavish spending on players had landed it with debts of \u00a3170m. \"I've found myself frustrated when it comes to the transfer market. That is one reason there are plans to introduce a share-option scheme for players,\" Sir Alex was quoted as telling United Shareholder magazine. He has regularly complained that United's rigid salary structure and transfer budget prevent him competing with leading Spanish and Italian clubs for top players. The share option scheme could be used as a useful bargaining chip when negotiating transfers and salary packages, leading football analysts said. Players would be rewarded in line with the performance of the United share price, which tends to rise in line with success on the field. \"It makes an awful lot of sense,\" said William Davies, a football analyst at stockbrokers Capel-Cure Sharp. \"The United share price has a good future, certainly for the next few years. Of course the share price could go down, but I regard United as the most attractive football club in the world. \"This would be a relatively cheap way of retaining and attracting players.\" Rising wages is one of the biggest problems facing United's accountants. Keane, the club captain, was recently given a pay rise taking him to \u00a352,000 a week. Company regulations would allow United to offer its players share options worth up to four times their salaries, meaning Keane could land a \u00a310m-plus shares package. However, there is no guarantee that he would see the full value of his shares. Share options are not usually redeemable for two or three years. Within that time the shares could be worth far more or far less. Four months ago United became the first football club to be valued in excess of \u00a31bn, after city analysts said that ManUtd.com, the club's website, was worth far more than originally thought. Since then the shares have fallen back, partly due to the possible overhaul of football transfers by Fifa, the game's governing body. Analysts fear that the likes of Beckham, who is valued at around \u00a340m, could leave the club for nothing after the Fifa overhaul, meaning that United's assets would not be nearly as valuable as currently thought. \"When the club buys a player, it will have to shell out a considerable sum in wages and won't get anything back in return,\" said Julian Easthope, an analyst with UBS Warburg. \"Manchester United is up against European clubs who have big benefactors behind them and are willing to take losses to pay high salaries.\"",

      "bodyText": "In exile and in war, Yasser Arafat has personified his people's aspirations through four turbulent decades and today, with the Palestinians closer to regaining statehood than at any time since 1948, he will take another historic decision: to invite the wrath of Israel and the US by declaring independence next week, or to wait. Mr Arafat's appearance before the Palestine Liberation Organisation's central council in Gaza city this weekend follows another difficult choice, his refusal during talks with President Clinton on the sidelines of the UN millennium summit in New York this week, to yield on the Palestinians' claim to Jerusalem. But after giving the council's 127 members his version of what transpired at New York, Mr Arafat is expected to urge a postponement of any unilateral declaration of a state until November 15 at the earliest. This latest delay - Mr Arafat held off such a declaration in May last year - is in part intended to blunt condemnation of the Palestinian leader as the villain of the peace process for his refusal to give Israel sovereignty of Islamic and Christian holy places in those parts of Jerusalem it has occupied since 1967. \"He will sell it to the world, to Europe and America, to show his flexibility,\" said an Arafat adviser, Mamdoh Nofal. \"It is not so important for Mr Arafat to declare on this date, if there is no real change in his position as leader, or in the condition of his people. He has many of the elements of a state. We have 36,000 military men with weapons.

One of them is that he does not have the land for a viable state - his forces have exclusive control of only 40% of the West Bank and Gaza - or the finances. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has threatened to retaliate against any unilateral declaration by annexing territory and imposing a blockade on an economy that is wholly dependent on Israel. Another restraint is the lack of support for statehood now, as the Palestinian leader discovered during a fortnight of flying around world capitals after his peace talks with Mr Barak ended inconclusively at Camp David in July despite much direct involvement by President Bill Clinton. The US and most European countries are among those opposing a unilaterial declaration at present. \"Mr Arafat knows that he struck hard at Mr Clinton and Mr Barak when he refused their plans and he knows they are so angry and they are waiting around the corner to ambush him and take revenge. So he will not give them such a chance to strike by declaring a state,\" Mr Nodal said. And yet Mr Arafat cannot hold off indefinitely without appearing ridiculous to his own people. Many delegates to the PLO's central council - including members of his own Fatah faction - want him to declare a state next week, no matter what the consequences, because they have no trust in a process which has seen Israel consistently break promises to hand over territory, or release political prisoners.

The weekend meeting in Gaza has the veneer of democracy, but few think the council will do more than rubber-stamp a decision that is Mr Arafat's alone.

      "body": "<p>Bruce Gyngell, the Australian inventor of British breakfast television, who has died aged 71, was one of the most colourful, idiosyncratic and domineering of media pioneers. He was far removed from the grey-haired executives who have tended to control ITV television behind the scenes. Gyngell stood out even in an industry where media tycoons from Lord (Lew) Grade to Rupert Murdoch called the shots. His staff nicknamed him the \"pink panther\" because of his love for the colour he saw as life-enhancing: he wore pastel pink shirts, and had his office painted pink, with yellow sofas.</p> <p>His 50-year career was packed with dramatic twists, spanning the start of television in Australia - his was the first face to appear on screens - and the introduction of sofa-style television to Britain. Gyngell is best known in the UK for his high-profile completion of the rescue of TV-am, a year after its disastrous launch in 1983.</p> <p>The first commercial breakfast franchise had teetered on the verge of collapse, losing \u00a3500,000 a month, when in 1984 he was persuaded by his Australian colleague, the businessman Kerry Packer (who had taken a rescue stake) to sort it out. By 1986 it was ready for flotation on the stock exchange, and briefly flowered into the most profitable of television networks. This was achieved by ruthlessly targeting programme costs - and dumping the 1984 Olympics coverage. He made the station a place \"of eternal summer so that the lost, lonely people could turn on and feel warm and bright\" - it may have been naff, but it was effective.</p> <p>He singlehandedly invented friendly sofa-style television and chatty presentation - although it was far from easy. The TV-am sofas were actually benches, to encourage guests to sit up, but upholstered to disguise the fact. Viewers felt they joined a surrogate family, with Anne Diamond playing the fresh-faced but smart girl from next door. The company, run from Camden Lock, North London, was moulded around Gyngell and his often faddish likes and dislikes.</p> <p>Some thought him barmy, predatory, or worse. Employees had to fit in. But he encouraged newcomers into television: his former secretary, Ulrika Jonsson, was made the weather girl, to inject some cheer into forecasts. Gyngell broke the rules, and liked to pose as being outside the wasteful British television establishment, while always remem bering to court the powerful. One of his early fallings-out was with a talented rising executive, Greg Dyke, who had already set TV-am on the road to recovery with Roland Rat before Gyngell's arrival.</p> <p>Gyngell, an outspoken believer in market forces, but with charm bordering on charisma, became Margaret Thatcher's favourite broadcasting executive when she was prime minister. When she complained about ITV being the \"last bastion of restrictive practices\", he endured a bruising technicians' strike from 1987-88 - more than 200 were sacked - but suffered a heart attack due to stress.</p> <p>He wanted change in ITV to cut out waste, a redrawing of the regional network, a Channel 5 to provide more competition. But by 1988, he was already speaking out against a blind auction of franchises, recognising the destruction it would wreak. By a cruel twist, the highest-bidder auction that Thatcher introduced in the flawed 1990 Broadcasting Act ensured that TV-am's \u00a314.3m bid was completely overshadowed by a rival offer from the GMTV consortium of \u00a334.6m when the awards were announced in October 1991. TV-am, the company he had shaped and nurtured, was effectively destroyed.</p> <p>But Gyngell had a final surprise up his sleeve. A day after the news broke, he was hosting the first (and last) TV-am journalism awards. There, he dramatically, almost as an afterthought, produced a handwritten letter from Thatcher. He read it out to the astonished audience. \"When I see how some of the licences have been awarded, I am mystified that you did not receive yours and heartbroken. You of all people have done so much for the whole of television . . . I am only too painfully aware that I was responsible for the legislation,\" she wrote.</p> <p>It was a sensation. The audience gasped, then applauded. Thatcher was saying sorry.</p> <p>In true Gyngell style, he refused to be broken. He proceeded to hold the company together until December 31 1992, through sheer force of personality. The final morning's broadcast ended, at 9.30 am, with the station belting out You're Simply the Best as a photograph of everyone who had ever worked for the station was flashed on to the screen. It was a moment of high emotion, and great sadness.</p> <p>Gyngell then hosted a champagne-fuelled farewell party with the sole founder-survivor, Sir David Frost, by his side. Yet, true to promise, the severance terms were very generous, and many of his multi-skilled, hard-working staff were snapped up by GMTV and the rest of ITV. Five years later, he had the bitter satisfaction of being proved right as the licence payments were slashed.</p> <p>Gyngell always remained Australia's golden media boy. He was born in Melbourne, and inherited some pretty extraordinary genes. His great grandfather was the pyrotechnician for the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, while his grandfather, who settled in Australia, introduced cider-making to the continent. His father ran a flying circus before becoming an engineer with Mobil, and his mother was of Irish extraction.</p> <p>He attended the private Sydney Grammar School and briefly studied medicine at the city's medical school. But he took time out to work as a disc jockey for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, joined the university air squadron and was desolate when the Korean war ended before he had a chance of action. He stayed at ABC until he was 22, when Sir Frank Packer, the newspaper tycoon took a shine to him and offered him a job with Consolidated Press. Packer then won one of the first two licences for commercial television. Gyngell fixed himself up with a two-year traineeship in New York.</p> <p>At NBC and Columbia University, he fell in love with television, and returned to Australia: on September 16 1956, he opened Packer's network with the words: \"Good evening and welcome to television.\"</p> <p>In a 10-year stint, he made Channel 9 the most successful network. He got married for the first time, to Ann Barr, and had three children. But, in a pattern that was to repeat itself, he walked out of his job in a row over money and autonomy. He was wooed by the rival Channel 7, with more money and a Bentley - Gyngell loved the good things of life, and was always immaculately dressed.</p> <p>Then he switched to Lew (later Lord) Grade's ATV in Britain, and backed such 1960s classics as The Golden Shot, Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased) and New Faces. Once again he took off when Grade refused to make him chairman. Back home in Australia, he was offered the chairmanship of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, started an ethnic aboriginal channel, and by the early 1980s had become absorbed with eastern ideas - Zen Buddhism, meditation and the Insight philosophy.</p> <p>For much of his latter life he followed a macrobiotic diet - even when entertaining at the Savoy. He believed in the power of positive thinking. And he was always very superstitious. At the time of the franchise renewal, staff wore company watches and key fobs, and were supposed to rub them to channel positive forces.</p> <p>This eccentric streak became ever more pronounced as the success of TV-am allowed him to dictate what went on. The call from Kerry Packer to sort out TV-am, which he had described as a \"load of old crap\", had made him the UK's highest paid television executive, at \u00a3193,000 a year.</p> <p>In 1986, he married again, this time Kathy Rowan, a TV-am producer, and started a second family, with two sons, Adam (now at Eton) and Jamie. After the licence was handed to GMTV, he toyed with alternatives, but soon returned to Australia, to lick his wounds, and run Channel 9 for two years. He also helped to launch the first World Summit on Children's Television, now a regular biennial fixture.</p> <p>But this familar maverick did not stay away from Britain for long. He bounced back in 1995, as chief executive of a bruised Yorkshire Television (in an odd double act with its chairman, Ward Thomas), later absorbed by Granada.</p> <p>F or a man whose private language and jokes could be salty in the extreme, he then pulled another surprise, by turning into a moral guardian. Gyngell was appalled first by tacky late night ITV schedules, and then by a prime-time series, Hollywood Lovers, which had segments on the \"mile-high club\" and plastic surgery for genitalia.

      "body": "<p>Scientists are on the trail of a terrible moment in history, recorded only in the annual growth rings of trees around the world. </p> <p>Chronologies from oaks and other trees from Ireland to Poland, from Finland to Siberia, from North America and even southern South America, all point to the same moment in AD540, when some worldwide event affected growth. </p> <p>It could, according to Mike Baillie, a palaeoecologist from Queen's University in Belfast, be evidence of a cosmic catastrophe that plunged Europe into the real dark ages. And it could be a key to the world painted in the legends of King Arthur and the Round Table. </p> <p>Prof Baillie told the British Association's science festival that the tree rings were an accurate record of conditions from the past. The coincidence of low growth in annual rings from around AD540 were evidence of darkened skies and chilly summers, of successive failed harvests and widespread famine. In a succession of upheavals, up to a third of the people of Europe perished. </p> <p>Even in recent times, he said, failed harvests and epidemics had coincided with stunted tree growth. But stunted growth in three continents in the same year was highly unusual. </p> <p>\"Just how unusual it is can be conveyed by the fact that these chronologies quantify the 540 event as the worst or the second worst or one of the four worst events in the last 1,500 years,\" he said. </p> <p>He argued that the story told by the oaks - both living and those extracted from bogs and old buildings - could be evidence of the earth's bombardment by a swarm of comet fragments. There was little evidence in written history, except for a 13th century reference to a comet in Gaul \"so vast that the whole sky seemed on fire\" in either 540 or 541. </p> <p>But he said other kinds of story might provide another clue: the dates for the death of the mythical King Arthur were variously 537, 539 and 542, and the legend was centred on the story of a wasteland, an ailing king and failed fertility. </p> <p>\"I've even gone to extreme of looking at some mythology, which is normally taboo for scientists,\" he said. \"The bottom line is, in my view we had some sort of interaction with a comet, a cometary bombardment, not a full-blown comet because we wouldn't be here if we had that, but probably bits of a comet.\" </p> <p>Three British astronomers had in 1990 calculated that the earth had been at risk of cometary bombardment between AD400 and AD600. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Scientists are on the trail of a terrible moment in history, recorded only in the annual growth rings of trees around the world. Chronologies from oaks and other trees from Ireland to Poland, from Finland to Siberia, from North America and even southern South America, all point to the same moment in AD540, when some worldwide event affected growth. It could, according to Mike Baillie, a palaeoecologist from Queen's University in Belfast, be evidence of a cosmic catastrophe that plunged Europe into the real dark ages. And it could be a key to the world painted in the legends of King Arthur and the Round Table. Prof Baillie told the British Association's science festival that the tree rings were an accurate record of conditions from the past. The coincidence of low growth in annual rings from around AD540 were evidence of darkened skies and chilly summers, of successive failed harvests and widespread famine. In a succession of upheavals, up to a third of the people of Europe perished. Even in recent times, he said, failed harvests and epidemics had coincided with stunted tree growth. But stunted growth in three continents in the same year was highly unusual. \"Just how unusual it is can be conveyed by the fact that these chronologies quantify the 540 event as the worst or the second worst or one of the four worst events in the last 1,500 years,\" he said. He argued that the story told by the oaks - both living and those extracted from bogs and old buildings - could be evidence of the earth's bombardment by a swarm of comet fragments. There was little evidence in written history, except for a 13th century reference to a comet in Gaul \"so vast that the whole sky seemed on fire\" in either 540 or 541. But he said other kinds of story might provide another clue: the dates for the death of the mythical King Arthur were variously 537, 539 and 542, and the legend was centred on the story of a wasteland, an ailing king and failed fertility. \"I've even gone to extreme of looking at some mythology, which is normally taboo for scientists,\" he said. \"The bottom line is, in my view we had some sort of interaction with a comet, a cometary bombardment, not a full-blown comet because we wouldn't be here if we had that, but probably bits of a comet.\" Three British astronomers had in 1990 calculated that the earth had been at risk of cometary bombardment between AD400 and AD600.",

He once worked non-stop for 48 hours at Dan-Air, and later in the space of a few days crisscrossed the globe between London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, and back before booking himself into hospital for the night for surgery. He was at his desk the next morning, and rounded off his day with a three-mile run in Hyde Park. James is not a big one for holidays. \"I have had the odd weekend in Venice but I have never had a proper holiday abroad. In business I have travelled so much that the last thing I want to do when I'm relaxing is to go a long distance.\" That said, he has been known to fly to Sydney to see the whole of a Test match, and allocates himself three sacrosanct weeks a year off to pit his fabled powers of risk analysis against the bookies at Ascot, Goodwood and Cheltenham race courses. Marriage though, never got a look in. \"I never intended to be a bachelor,\" he said. \"When I could have married I felt I was too poor, and when I had enough, I was too busy. Now I am too old.\" So what drives this human dynamo to such Stakhanovite excesses in late middle age is something of a mystery. He lives relatively modestly for a multi-millionaire, between a home in central London and one in Hove close to the cricket ground. Glyndebourne, the home of his other great passion, opera, is only down the road. (He turned around the English Symphony Orchestra just for fun after a major problem with funds). Even his offices in Victoria are \"a bit of a broom cupboard\". It is the sheer kick of salvaging the seemingly unsalvageable that appears to turn him on. Asked why he agreed to take on the dome, when he is already chairman of the Robinson Group and a member of Lloyd's regulatory board, James fired back: \"Like Everest, it's there. You've got to climb it.\" Nor is he being paid, of course. A knighthood being worth so much more, presumably, and a peerage priceless.",

      "bodyText": "A Mayan palace that has been discovered in a remote Guatemalan jungle is being hailed as a major archaeologicalfind that could mean the rewriting of Mayan history. The size and condition of the palace are said to rival that of the temple in Tikal, in the north of the country, regarded as one of the great ancient sites of the world. The archaeologists who unearthed the palace literally stumbled into it. The discovery was made by archaeologists led by Dr Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University in Nashville and Dr Tomas Barrientos of the Universidad del Valle in Guatemala. The expedition, which was sponsored by the Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology and History, the National Geographic Society and Vanderbilt University, unearthed previously hidden buildings and artefacts at Cancuen, north-east of Guatemala City, and near the Pasion River. It is believed that the discovery will lead to a new understanding of political life in Mayan civilisation which was at its height between AD300 and 900, the so-called classic period. Mayan civilisation was divided into several rival city states, mainly in Guatemala but also in Mexico, Belize and Honduras. Classic Mayan civilisation collapsed around AD900 for no generally agreed reason and all the cities were abandoned. It is hoped that the latest discovery may throw some light on this period. \"No-one has found anything like this since the turn of the last century,\" Dr Demarest told the New York Times. \"What is most incredible about this site is that most of the palace is buried virtually intact.\" The king who completed the construction of the palace at Cancuen was Tah ak Chaan who ruled the area for around 50 years from 740 onwards. What differentiates the site from the better-known ones in Guatemala is that there is no sign of the spectacular pyramids which have been seen as the hallmark of the Mayan sites. This is one of the reasons that it has remained undiscovered for so long. There was also initially no indication that the city state there had engaged in warfare which is highly unusual for the period. A lot of jade has already been found at the site. One 16kg (35lb) piece had been discovered which had been used for creating ornaments. The walls are constructed of solid limestone. Surprisingly there is little indication of religious practices which are normally a feature of such sites. Dr Demarest decided to visit the area last year after more than 10 years of archaeological research in Guatemala. He was following up a finding by members of his team which referred to a princess from Cancuen. \"To the untrained eye, the palace looks just like a great jungle-covered hill,\" said Dr Demarest. It was while walking in the area that he fell into a gap and realised that he had stumbled across what turned out to be a three-storey palace built around 11 courtyards and encompassing 170 rooms. The city appears to have had a large commercial centre with many artisans employed producing ornaments for trading. The stonework is said to be of a very high standard and there have been finds of pyrite, or fool's gold, which was used for making mirrors. It is estimated that it will take around 10 years to excavate the site fully. Although the area is no longer in the throes of a civil war, which ended in 1996, it is in a fairly inaccessible region of Guatemala. The full excavations are unlikely to start until next February at the end of the rainy season. The discovery will be welcomed by the Guatemalan government who have suffered from the departure of tourists in recent months following a fatal attack on a group of Japanese visitors in the village of Todos Santos. Tikal has been a chief reason for tourists to visit the area and the discovery of such a major site is likely to bring in a new wave of tourists to help the country's embattled economy.",

Having been abroad at the time, I was glad to hear repeated Peter Mandelson's extraordinarily unpleasant interview on Today about Julia Langdon's biography of Mo Mowlam. Julia is a relation by marriage, so I'm biased, but I think most people would marvel at the way the prime minister's master manipulator, the man with his finger permanently resting on the public pulse, is so ignorant of the general opinion that he thinks that his whining, self-justifying tone, like chocolate-covered bile, will make anyone trust a single judgment he makes. </p> <p>\u0095 Sacha Distel is in trouble at home for suggesting that English is a better language for singing than French. I suspect he's wrong. French is, in itself, a very musical language, even when used by hard-swearing truck drivers, which is why the actual tunes of French songs tend to be so lacklustre. In fact, it's my theory that all French pop songs have the same melody. Take Fran\u00e7oise Hardy's huge hit, Tous les Gar\u00e7ons et les Filles, in which, with hypnotic boredom, the first 12 syllables are all sung on the same note. </p> <p>\u0095 The Bolsheviks at Ekatarinburg knew what to do when you had a house full of unpopular and dysfunctional people; you took them to the cellar and shot the lot. Sadly this won't happen to the cast of Big Brother. (Why, if it's supposed to be gripping the nation, do the best audience figures show that only 10% of us are watching it?) The most depressing news-paper picture of the week showed two ousted occupants of the house, Nichola and Caroline, lying on the floor of some ghastly function, having collided with Vanessa Feltz. Depressing because it's obvious that the British press, desperate for something to fill empty acres of newsprint, has decided that these people are stars, to be courted, feted and reported, and not just that most lethal type of nonentity, the extrovert bore. We will know that the end has been reached when one of them turns up as a member of the Booker prize panel. </p> <p>\u0095 We did a lot of riding on holiday, and decided that the children should wear helmets. Not surprisingly, this evoked a mixture of rage and shame. Our 14-year-old daughter even refused to be photographed with the thing off her head, on the grounds that wearing it had messed up her hair. The result was that I had to act like a paparazzo with my own family, sneaking snapshots when they weren't looking. All very silly, I thought, until I returned to England to learn that a TV company is making a film about the late Kenneth Williams, and wants to use a clip from an interview I did with him on BBC2 almost 20 years ago. I was flattered at first, but then the horror hit me: the long, lank, greasy hair, the appalling glasses and, I suspect, an unforgivable tie! Nobody who watches this will hear a word Williams says. Instead they will be gazing in terrified awe at my hideous, post-1970s appearance, and my poor children will be jeered in school. </p> <p>\u0095 George W Bush is supposedly in hot water after calling a New York Times reporter \"a major-league asshole\", though I can't imagine it will do him any harm with the voters, especially as the Times has become a very self-consciously elite national paper. And at least what he said was perfectly coherent. There are now many websites devoted to Bushisms, offering hours of agreeable browsing and proving that linguistic incompetence may be genetically transferred. The best quotes appear on all the sites, and include - from last month alone - \"we cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation hostile, or hold our allies hostile\" and \"this campaign not only hears the voices of the entrepreneurs and the farmers and the entrepreneurs, we hear the voices of those struggling to get ahead\". </p> <p>Other golden goodies include \"there's not going to be enough people in the system to take advantage of people like me\" (in a discussion of pensions). Or this penetrating analysis of his campaigning style: \"Actually, I - this may sound a little west Texan to you, but I like it. When I'm talking about - when I'm talking about myself, and when he's talking about myself, all of us are talking about me.\" To his rival, John McCain, he said: \"I think we agree, the past is over.\" Then there is his plan for economic recovery: \"We ought to make the pie higher.\" Many of the best are too long to reprint, but have a tremendous rococo charm, as he rambles up and down through the byways of his mind, sometimes getting stuck in the bracken of his inchoate emotions, sometimes being knocked over by a passing thought or aper\u00e7u. There's no reason why this should hurt his chances; two of the last three American presidents suffered from just the same affliction. </p> <p>\u0095 Many thanks to all of you who wrote and emailed to say where I could find a copy of William Hope Hodgson's classic horror stories, Carnacki the Ghost-Finder. Though, admittedly, two people only offered the Japanese translation. I now have two copies in English, and have no intention of waiting till I get flu before I read it.</p>",

Julia is a relation by marriage, so I'm biased, but I think most people would marvel at the way the prime minister's master manipulator, the man with his finger permanently resting on the public pulse, is so ignorant of the general opinion that he thinks that his whining, self-justifying tone, like chocolate-covered bile, will make anyone trust a single judgment he makes. \u0095 Sacha Distel is in trouble at home for suggesting that English is a better language for singing than French. I suspect he's wrong. French is, in itself, a very musical language, even when used by hard-swearing truck drivers, which is why the actual tunes of French songs tend to be so lacklustre. In fact, it's my theory that all French pop songs have the same melody. Take Fran\u00e7oise Hardy's huge hit, Tous les Gar\u00e7ons et les Filles, in which, with hypnotic boredom, the first 12 syllables are all sung on the same note. \u0095 The Bolsheviks at Ekatarinburg knew what to do when you had a house full of unpopular and dysfunctional people; you took them to the cellar and shot the lot. Sadly this won't happen to the cast of Big Brother. (Why, if it's supposed to be gripping the nation, do the best audience figures show that only 10% of us are watching it?) The most depressing news-paper picture of the week showed two ousted occupants of the house, Nichola and Caroline, lying on the floor of some ghastly function, having collided with Vanessa Feltz. Depressing because it's obvious that the British press, desperate for something to fill empty acres of newsprint, has decided that these people are stars, to be courted, feted and reported, and not just that most lethal type of nonentity, the extrovert bore. We will know that the end has been reached when one of them turns up as a member of the Booker prize panel. \u0095 We did a lot of riding on holiday, and decided that the children should wear helmets. Not surprisingly, this evoked a mixture of rage and shame. Our 14-year-old daughter even refused to be photographed with the thing off her head, on the grounds that wearing it had messed up her hair. The result was that I had to act like a paparazzo with my own family, sneaking snapshots when they weren't looking. All very silly, I thought, until I returned to England to learn that a TV company is making a film about the late Kenneth Williams, and wants to use a clip from an interview I did with him on BBC2 almost 20 years ago. I was flattered at first, but then the horror hit me: the long, lank, greasy hair, the appalling glasses and, I suspect, an unforgivable tie! Nobody who watches this will hear a word Williams says. Instead they will be gazing in terrified awe at my hideous, post-1970s appearance, and my poor children will be jeered in school. \u0095 George W Bush is supposedly in hot water after calling a New York Times reporter \"a major-league asshole\", though I can't imagine it will do him any harm with the voters, especially as the Times has become a very self-consciously elite national paper. And at least what he said was perfectly coherent. There are now many websites devoted to Bushisms, offering hours of agreeable browsing and proving that linguistic incompetence may be genetically transferred. The best quotes appear on all the sites, and include - from last month alone - \"we cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation hostile, or hold our allies hostile\" and \"this campaign not only hears the voices of the entrepreneurs and the farmers and the entrepreneurs, we hear the voices of those struggling to get ahead\". Other golden goodies include \"there's not going to be enough people in the system to take advantage of people like me\" (in a discussion of pensions). Or this penetrating analysis of his campaigning style: \"Actually, I - this may sound a little west Texan to you, but I like it. When I'm talking about - when I'm talking about myself, and when he's talking about myself, all of us are talking about me.\" To his rival, John McCain, he said: \"I think we agree, the past is over.\" Then there is his plan for economic recovery: \"We ought to make the pie higher.\" Many of the best are too long to reprint, but have a tremendous rococo charm, as he rambles up and down through the byways of his mind, sometimes getting stuck in the bracken of his inchoate emotions, sometimes being knocked over by a passing thought or aper\u00e7u. There's no reason why this should hurt his chances; two of the last three American presidents suffered from just the same affliction. \u0095 Many thanks to all of you who wrote and emailed to say where I could find a copy of William Hope Hodgson's classic horror stories, Carnacki the Ghost-Finder. Though, admittedly, two people only offered the Japanese translation. I now have two copies in English, and have no intention of waiting till I get flu before I read it.",

According to Geoffrey Wheatcroft, Gustav Kobb\u00e9, compiler of the Complete Opera book, was an amateur yachtsman.

A footnote explains - they put these things in footnotes to discourage children from reading them - that Susanna Hill stood trial at the Old Bailey on September 16 that year for hanging him. There was no dispute that Hill had placed a cord around the composer's neck, but this seems to have been for reasons which I too shall have to put in a footnote. At any rate, he did not survive, and I'm not sure his set of six songs, listed in Grove, did any better. </p> <p> Whatever you make of such incidents, there is no doubt at all that the lives as well as the deaths of many great composers are inextricably linked with transport. My favourite Exonian savant lists, among others, De-bus-sy, Bus-oni, Antonio Cab-ezon, Elliot Car-ter, and even Vaughan Williams (usually known as VW). All, as he says, are connected with t-Ravel.

It pandered to our basest TV instincts, crossing the cutesy elements of Animal Hospital (endearing puppies) with that staple of the post-docusoap documentary, the progress (or not) of a band of wannabes - in this case, police dog handlers. </p> <p>With Sandi Toksvig narrating, this was never going to be anything other than warm and fuzzy. It was so upbeat, in fact, that it came over as a recruitment video for the Metropolitan Police. Maybe the government should have thought of that angle before making those Could You? advertisements. \"Join us - you can cuddle dogs.\" </p> <p>PC Peter liked cuddling dogs but Luke was an old Alsatian and would soon be retired (whether that meant retired in the Mafia sense, they didn't say). Hence PC Peter needed a new partner to help look for stolen videos in bushes. So it was up to PC Steve to produce a new police dog. Not himself, obviously, but with the help of Kerry, who was with puppies. Soon she was without puppies and they were scampering about and getting tested for scaredy cat-ness. We can expect many more weeks of man-dog bonding. </p> <p>Much more fun than Police Dog Academy would have been a cross between Mersey Blues and When Pets Attack! With Leo in Brookside (Channel 4) hoping to join the boys in blue, we may not have to wait for that kind of carnage down Manor Park way.

It pandered to our basest TV instincts, crossing the cutesy elements of Animal Hospital (endearing puppies) with that staple of the post-docusoap documentary, the progress (or not) of a band of wannabes - in this case, police dog handlers. With Sandi Toksvig narrating, this was never going to be anything other than warm and fuzzy. It was so upbeat, in fact, that it came over as a recruitment video for the Metropolitan Police. Maybe the government should have thought of that angle before making those Could You? advertisements. \"Join us - you can cuddle dogs.\" PC Peter liked cuddling dogs but Luke was an old Alsatian and would soon be retired (whether that meant retired in the Mafia sense, they didn't say). Hence PC Peter needed a new partner to help look for stolen videos in bushes. So it was up to PC Steve to produce a new police dog. Not himself, obviously, but with the help of Kerry, who was with puppies. Soon she was without puppies and they were scampering about and getting tested for scaredy cat-ness. We can expect many more weeks of man-dog bonding. Much more fun than Police Dog Academy would have been a cross between Mersey Blues and When Pets Attack! With Leo in Brookside (Channel 4) hoping to join the boys in blue, we may not have to wait for that kind of carnage down Manor Park way. If he succeeds, he will soon have to arrest his dad since, whatever the crime on the close, Mick is in the frame.

And Andy Goldsworthy has created a monumental sculptural conceit called London Wall, a vast expanse of local clay packed against the curved gallery wall at the Barbican Centre. </p> <p>The idea is that during the course of Goldsworthy's exhibition (itself entitled Time), viewers can watch the clay drying out and cracking into its own elegant crazy-paving design, but even on a single visit the wall is impressive. Its scale is exhilarating, and close up its unwilled composition of agapanthine shapes and mottled coloration is rather beautiful. But for anyone who is curious to see a rapid pr\u00e9cis of this process - the deepening of cracks into fissures and the bleaching of the clay from mud brown to white, Goldsworthy's experiment can also be seen as part of a work currently showing in the Barbican theatre, R\u00e9gine Chopinot's La Danse du Temps. </p> <p>Chopinot and Goldsworthy are natural collaborators, since both are introspective artists with big ideas about nature, and both are distressingly capable of veering from imaginative grandeur into New Age preciousness. La Danse du Temps contains these extremes in frustratingly equal measure. </p> <p>The work starts out with hypnotic promise, as 16 dancers from the Ballet Atlantique (aged from 20 to 70) cross the stage in a drift of movement so slow and fluid they seem less like people than a landscape eroded by wind or tide. We don't register a deliberate composition of rhythms or steps so much as movement eddying and looping through the dancers' bodies. And in the work's overall structure there is a similar sense of ideas passing like weather fronts. At times the dancers breast the stage like waves in flood, at times they seem whirled by a battening gale, at times they stand in space as quiet and concentrated as a night sky. </p> <p>This organic approach to form is echoed in Ton-That Tiet's music, which evolves in washes of sound from chants to strings and percussion, as well as in Goldsworthy's backdrop, which is essentially a speeded-up film of a clay wall drying. What starts out as a plain expanse gradually fractures during the work's 70 minutes into a mosaic of crevices, revealing at its centre the pattern of a serpentine river course in darker clay. </p> <p>At its best this work suggests that Chopinot has looked at the world profoundly. Her construction of shape and texture within the mass of the dancers' bodies sometimes possesses the mysterious draw of the natural world. Her nuances of pace and rhythm are subtle enough to make us feel time as a sensuous force. At its leaden worst, however, the choreography's slow pace and drifting structure do invite the inevitable crack about watching paint dry, as we sit and will Goldsworthy's wall to complete its cycle. </p> <p>Basically, Chopinot's material would suit a work of only half its length, and between her moments of inspired meditation she resorts to wadding of earnest, feeble choreography, conceived in the dreariest, touchy-feely school of new European dance. La Danse du Temps is one of those events that would be transformed by a good editor. </p> <p>As it is, sitting through its most repetitious longueurs the minutes feel like hours. Time becomes not a subject of contemplation, but an instrument of mild, well-intentioned torture. </p> <p>\u0095 La Danse du Temps is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), tonight.</p>",

The three-day week, the power cuts and my little family sitting around in the candlelight all through the winter of discontent; me gloating, because I couldn't do my homework, my father self-righteous about supporting his fellow trades unionists, and my mum bringing the party down with the occasional cry of, \"I don't care about no revolution, Bill. It's dead depressing, sitting 'ere in the bleedin' dark!\" </p> <p>In those days, candles were something you kept in the cupboard under the sink in case of emergencies. And, just as my dear late mum would have goggled at you in disbelief if you'd told her then that she'd go on to spend a good part of her old age struggling to and from the Co-Op on treacherous black ice carrying bottles of bloody water for her jumped-up daughter, she would have been similarly unbelieving that, one day, women would voluntarily spend \u00a320 of their hard-earned money on one poxing scented candle that they would then proceed to burn regardless of the availability of electricity, rather than begrudge parting with 99p for a box of six plain white. </p> <p>If there was a power cut tonight, in fact, half the professional young childless households in the nation's urban centres probably wouldn't notice, because a lot of them will be listening to their personal mini-disc players by the light of a dozen flickering wicks. It's a strange idea, and not a little sad - all those twenty- and thirtysomething girls slipping out of aromatherapy baths called things like Sensual and Pamper only to sit about in the dappled dark like spare pricks at a seance, while lonely men download cyberporn in their own soft cells. </p> <p>I'll tell you who's really happy about it, though: the UnShopkeepers. This country, I am sure, will in the future be condemned by some snooty Frenchmen as being a nation of UnShopkeepers. Yes, the butcher and the baker may both be facing rising rates and a future in some godforsaken call centre as their particular skills get priced out by the big boys, but the candlestickmaker is fast becoming king of the heap, central as his goods are to the UnShop. </p> <p>You know an UnShop when you see it. Just like vampires are the undead, an UnShop gives every impression of being just like any other until you get up close. Then, rather than a pair of fangs and no reflection, you see the tell-tale signs: a mass of candles of every hue and pong, numerous candleholders, strange-shaped, apparently useless little pots that are, in fact, holders for small candles, which, in turn, heat aromatherapy oils and, most vital of all, arrangements of small, coloured pebbles in transparent plastic cubes half-filled with water and which cost the best part of a tenner. Most of these gadgets are made in the developing world, and you can't help but imagine the look on the workers' faces - perplexed, contemptuous, but surely never envious - as they earn their meagre wages making these monumentally useless distractions for adults who have more money than sense. I'm not pointing the finger here. Just the other day, I found myself in a shop called Inspirations, trying to decide between a plastic triangle filled with small, coloured beads and a plastic rectangle filled with small, coloured beads (I couldn't decide, so I bought both). </p> <p>What the growth of the UnShop feeds off, of course, is the modern mania for relaxation. In the past, relaxation came naturally: a man or woman went to work, did their daily drudgery, peeled off their pantyhose and then got well and truly slaughtered. But barely anyone uses the gorgeous phrase \"a little R&amp;R\" any more, carrying as it does connotations of slobbing out, drinking up and getting down. It just sounds too dirty . The new buzzwords are \"chilling out\", \"de-stressing\" and, worst of all, the repellent \"pampering\".</p> <p>For all you trainspotters who like counting how many times I've cracked my Guy Ritchie joke (you know, the one about how he got his scar by falling off his pony and landing on his silver spoon), I'm sure you'll recognise my definitive take on the use of the word \"pampering\" in modern retail, too. It means: \"Have a wash and stop being such a neurotic cow.\" Pampering is sex for the sex-less and rest for the rest-less. I bet you could prove with pie charts that the more scented candles a woman buys, the less orgasms/job security she has. Because what all the paraphernalia of the relaxation culture seeks to mimic, of course, is the feeling of security - a feeling that is pretty hard to come by in this non-contract, downsizing world, except in that crucial 10 minutes after really good sex. </p> <p> You have to hand it to capitalism, it's devilishly clever. If, as Lenin said, they could sell us the rope to hang them with, they've also sold us the drugs to tranquillise ourselves with while they proceed to screw more work with less security out of us. Look at aromatherapy: while pretending to be \"on the side\" of the consumer, it is actually all about medicating the consumer into a state of accepting passivity. If, as homeopaths claim, we should \"listen to our bodies\", shouldn't we also take positive action to change our situations when we feel anxiety, fear or anger? Yet aromatherapy tells us merely to sniff at something until those feelings go away! </p> <p>Tragically, even good causes have harnessed this new culture of passivity. WellBeing, which carries out research on health issues affecting women and children, has just launched, with Dove soap, a Dare To Indulge campaign, which, as no less a mezzobrow icon as Lorraine Kelly puts it, is all about \"encouraging women to take a little bit of time out for themselves, all for a good cause. Why not get your husband, friends or family to sponsor you in the indulgence of your choice... anything from having an aromatherapy massage to half-an-hour in a bubble bath... whatever makes you unwind, relax and de-stress\". </p> <p>Surely, in the face of endless under-investment by government into research that might stop thousands of people dying needlessly each year, shouldn't we be demanding that they do something useful with our taxes, rather than throwing millions at the Dome? Instead, we're advised to jump in the bath and not come out until our poor, ground-down husbands and friends part with even more money. Cleanliness is not only next to Godliness these days, but also to goodness in all its forms. I can't help thinking that we'll wake up soon, with all the water cold, the bubbles flat and the scum, as ever, rising to the top. Because, so long as we believe that satisfaction can come from personal cleanliness rather than political change, we'll always be whistling in the dark - no matter how many candles we light.</p>",

This was an exhausting experience and often a demoralising one, for there were copytakers who specialised in deflating one's ego with remarks such as, \"Was that supposed to be a joke?\" Now I will just send it by email to Weekend without fallible human intervention, and with luck it will get there in immaculate condition in only a few seconds. </p> <p>So why do we believe ourselves to be under such extraordinary stress? Most people would say it is because of the acceleration of life. In the past, we could take our time about things. Now, we are always in a rush.

We have come to expect miracles from them, and we feel just as frustrated when they are being slow or unresponsive as a peasant does with a recalcitrant mule. But now the stressful early days when we were getting to know each other are behind us, I find that, on balance, my computer contributes very positively to my general contentment and peace of mind. </p> <p>If, as is possible, we really are under greater stress than previous generations, I do not blame this on computers or any other forms of new technology, but on the presence of too much choice and too much marketing in the modern world. We have never before been subjected to so much competitive advertising and promotion on so many different media. We are being presented with vastly more options regarding things to buy or do than we can either afford or find time for, and this can cause us great anxiety. Most human beings are both greedy and competitive, and wish to enjoy all of the best that life has to offer - or, at any rate, as much of it as their neighbours enjoy. </p> <p>But they can't change their cars or their computers or their televisions every day; they can't take dozens of foreign holidays each year; they can't devote themselves to physical fitness while cooking and eating as the TV food pundits would like them to; they can't embrace every religion and every form of medicine in the world at the same time; they can't follow every sport, every form of culture, and every kind of activity that is urged upon them. But many of them would dearly like to, which drives them mad, since their lives are too short and there are not enough hours in the day. </p> <p> One should not have too much sympathy with people in this condition. They are suffering from what Sir Edward Heath once famously called, during a bad patch in his premiership, \"the problems of success\". Earlier generations, and still many people in Britain today, suffer from far worse problems than that. In Piers Brendon's excellent new book about the 30s, The Dark Valley, you can read that in 1923 an average of five coal miners were killed in Britain every working day, and 32 were injured every hour. Between 1922 and 1924 (inclusive), 3,603 miners were killed and 597,198 were injured - a far higher casualty rate than in 30 years of the troubles in Northern Ireland. It is true that even the abused coal miners drew some comfort from their lack of alternative ways of earning a living, mainly in a sense of community and solidarity with their fellow sufferers.

      "body": "<p>Panicale is an Umbrian hill town, though in my head it is pronounced by Eddie Waring, the much-missed rugby league commentator. Wonder if Eddie ever brought his wide vowels to Italy. Would enjoy Renaissance tour conducted by Geoffrey Boycott and David Lloyd. \"Fra Angelico, he's got nice soft hands, but when it cooms to t' chiaroscuro, Leonardo beats 'im 'ands down, wouldn't yer say, David?\"</p> <p>\"Aye, Geoffrey, t' sfumato technique, 'e's got that technique, it tewk 'ours o' practice, but now 'e can paint t'sunset so it lewks just like a bruise.\"</p> <p>\"Aye, David, I 'ad a bruise like that once, courtesy of Michael Holding.\"</p> <p>Restless cricket commentary in head - rather like television play by Jack Rosenthal - betrays my agitation. I am approaching Panicale with handsome middle-aged bisexual Fred, in whose country house I am staying with our associated teenagers. The young folk have been set down miles away on the shores of Lake Trasimeno to smoke, sulk, and perhaps even swim. Suddenly I am alone with Fred.</p> <p>No need to rush. Can't rush anyway. Too hot. Rugby League impossible - even walking needs to be gentle. Panicale sits proudly on a hilltop, its severe brown city walls drawn up around it like skirts. No suburbs, just a plunge of olives down to the plain. Fred parks under a tree, and I get out into a wave of heat and the sound of late-afternoon cicadas. As we stroll up the gentle incline into the town, Fred takes my arm. Not sure how to interpret this, as everyone else is arm-in-arm - men, women, children. Even Geoffrey Boycott and David Lloyd are arm-in-arm in my head. Strolling. Why do we never stroll in England?</p> <p>\"So, what do you think of it?\" asks Fred, as we reach a small square in which small children are playing round a fountain. \"On certain days, the fountains run with wine.\"</p> <p>I turn to him and see, for an instant, Michelangelo's David's dad. Is he looking deep into my eyes because he likes it, or is it because he's a gay sadist? (\"Ah think she might tek spin a bit later, David, ah think t' surface is brekkin oop.\")</p> <p>Echoes of children's voices wash around the brown walls. It is like being inside a gigantic biscuit. Confess I am enchanted. He looks as if he's wondering whether it's Panicale or him. Wonder if he's as uncertain as I am. Heart is beating rather faster than is advisable in middle-aged woman on hot Italian hillside.</p> <p>Ascend with great slowness into deserted higher square, in which sudden atmosphere of ghosts standing three-deep all around us is so palpable, I shiver.</p> <p>\"Are you cold?\" Fred puts his arm around me. Admit I can sense spectral presences. We look up and see For Sale signs beside blind and shuttered windows.</p> <p>\"Maybe you should buy a haunted flat here,\" smiles Fred. \"I'd love you as a neighbour.\" (\"Now, he's flighted that delivery, has Fred,\" remarks Geoffrey. \"He's beat 'er all ends up, she's all over the place.\")</p> <p>He'd love me as a neighbour? What sort of chat-up line is that? \"Your eyes... are so neighbourly! Oh God! I'm dying to borrow a cup of sugar and make beautiful noise all night!\"</p> <p>At the top of the town is another square, with a castle, and a warm wall against which we lean to look out at Umbria. Blue hills and a purple plain, across which lights are beginning to twinkle. Fred nuzzles in close. His arms are round my waist, his nose in my neck. Tendrils of my hair wave in his cinnamon-scented breath. I AM BEING EMBRACED. Unambiguously.</p> <p>\"What would you be doing if you were at home?\" he whispers.</p> <p>\"A thousand stupid things.\"</p> <p>\"Well, let's do nothing for the next few hours.\"</p> <p>Have to conclude that he is cuddling me because I remind him of his mother. Never mind. That'll do.</p> <p>Eventually we eat truffles, and fish from the lake, and then spend a long time on the ramparts, kissing like teenagers. I have stopped worrying about our teenagers. For the first time in years, I am not worrying about anybody. The cricketers in my head fall silent at last, and there is only this warm stranger. The plain below is dark and vast like a sea, and I can only suppose we are ships that pass in the night.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Panicale is an Umbrian hill town, though in my head it is pronounced by Eddie Waring, the much-missed rugby league commentator. Wonder if Eddie ever brought his wide vowels to Italy. Would enjoy Renaissance tour conducted by Geoffrey Boycott and David Lloyd. \"Fra Angelico, he's got nice soft hands, but when it cooms to t' chiaroscuro, Leonardo beats 'im 'ands down, wouldn't yer say, David?\" \"Aye, Geoffrey, t' sfumato technique, 'e's got that technique, it tewk 'ours o' practice, but now 'e can paint t'sunset so it lewks just like a bruise.\" \"Aye, David, I 'ad a bruise like that once, courtesy of Michael Holding.\" Restless cricket commentary in head - rather like television play by Jack Rosenthal - betrays my agitation. I am approaching Panicale with handsome middle-aged bisexual Fred, in whose country house I am staying with our associated teenagers. The young folk have been set down miles away on the shores of Lake Trasimeno to smoke, sulk, and perhaps even swim. Suddenly I am alone with Fred. No need to rush. Can't rush anyway. Too hot. Rugby League impossible - even walking needs to be gentle. Panicale sits proudly on a hilltop, its severe brown city walls drawn up around it like skirts. No suburbs, just a plunge of olives down to the plain. Fred parks under a tree, and I get out into a wave of heat and the sound of late-afternoon cicadas. As we stroll up the gentle incline into the town, Fred takes my arm. Not sure how to interpret this, as everyone else is arm-in-arm - men, women, children. Even Geoffrey Boycott and David Lloyd are arm-in-arm in my head. Strolling. Why do we never stroll in England? \"So, what do you think of it?\" asks Fred, as we reach a small square in which small children are playing round a fountain. \"On certain days, the fountains run with wine.\" I turn to him and see, for an instant, Michelangelo's David's dad. Is he looking deep into my eyes because he likes it, or is it because he's a gay sadist? (\"Ah think she might tek spin a bit later, David, ah think t' surface is brekkin oop.\") Echoes of children's voices wash around the brown walls. It is like being inside a gigantic biscuit. Confess I am enchanted. He looks as if he's wondering whether it's Panicale or him. Wonder if he's as uncertain as I am. Heart is beating rather faster than is advisable in middle-aged woman on hot Italian hillside. Ascend with great slowness into deserted higher square, in which sudden atmosphere of ghosts standing three-deep all around us is so palpable, I shiver. \"Are you cold?\" Fred puts his arm around me. Admit I can sense spectral presences. We look up and see For Sale signs beside blind and shuttered windows. \"Maybe you should buy a haunted flat here,\" smiles Fred. \"I'd love you as a neighbour.\" (\"Now, he's flighted that delivery, has Fred,\" remarks Geoffrey. \"He's beat 'er all ends up, she's all over the place.\") He'd love me as a neighbour? What sort of chat-up line is that? \"Your eyes... are so neighbourly! Oh God! I'm dying to borrow a cup of sugar and make beautiful noise all night!\" At the top of the town is another square, with a castle, and a warm wall against which we lean to look out at Umbria. Blue hills and a purple plain, across which lights are beginning to twinkle. Fred nuzzles in close. His arms are round my waist, his nose in my neck. Tendrils of my hair wave in his cinnamon-scented breath. I AM BEING EMBRACED. Unambiguously. \"What would you be doing if you were at home?\" he whispers. \"A thousand stupid things.\" \"Well, let's do nothing for the next few hours.\" Have to conclude that he is cuddling me because I remind him of his mother. Never mind. That'll do. Eventually we eat truffles, and fish from the lake, and then spend a long time on the ramparts, kissing like teenagers. I have stopped worrying about our teenagers. For the first time in years, I am not worrying about anybody. The cricketers in my head fall silent at last, and there is only this warm stranger. The plain below is dark and vast like a sea, and I can only suppose we are ships that pass in the night.",

      "body": "<p>You've seen them in the magazines, those homes - sorry living spaces - that exude a Zen-like calm. You've imagined what it must be like to wake in a bed of pure white linen with wafts of translucent silk moving at the window in the morning breeze. You've imagined what it must be like returning from a stressful day at the office to a room so peaceful you can forego the stiff gin and simply sit and breathe. You've imagined all this, but it is so far from the reality of your home - cluttered with the accessories, noise and bustle of modern life - that you have dismissed it as you would a dream. </p> <p>Not so fast. Okay, you have to use your home as an office, a kid's play centre, a storage depot and a motel, so a collection of sculpted aromatherapy candles in the centre of the sitting room is an impractical idea, but peace and harmony can still be yours. Honest. </p> <p>How to achieve this blissful state? It depends who you talk to, but the consensus among the house doctors is that it all comes down to colour and storage systems. You could have guessed storage would come up - sensible, unarguably good for us but dull, dull, dull, the world of interiors' equivalent of fibre and regular exercise. But colour, now that's exciting. </p> <p>We all associate colour with mood - red is the colour of sexuality and excitement, while blue is cool and reflective - but there are many who take this further, who claim that colour has the power to improve (and presumably damage) our sense of well-being. </p> <p>Colour therapy is not new. The ancient Egyptians had coloured rooms in their temples for treating and healing, but it is now re-emerging as a popular alternative practice and there are people, such as interior designer Catherine Cumming, who are starting to apply the principles of colour therapy to interior decoration. </p> <p>In her book, The Colour Healing Home (published next month by Mitchell Beazley, priced \u00a316.99), Cumming argues that it is possible to lift the \"energy\" around us and enhance our spirits simply through a bit of well-considered decoration. \"Colour therapists,\" she says, \"heal people by shining a coloured light on to them. Coloured pigment is less powerful, but once you start opening to it, the effect is astounding.\" </p> <p>Such therapy works on the premise that each colour has its own energy and that we absorb this through our light-sensitive cells. The aim is to create a balance and a free-flow of this energy. Obviously, no two people respond to colour in the same way, so this is a highly subjective practice, but there are some general rules. The most calming colours are the cool ones - blues, greens and violets - so the theory is that if we are aiming for peace and tranquillity we should eschew those fabulous hot red walls (far too energising for a stressed-out soul) and stick to the more gentle side of the spectrum. </p> <p>\"Violet,\" explains Cumming, \"is a tranquil colour that promotes inspiration and contemplation. Green is a balancing colour, neither hot nor cold, and is particularly effective in the city, where there are few green fields, but blue is the most calming of all. Being in a blue environment makes you breathe out and really slows you down. It is a perfect colour for bedrooms and promotes good, cosy dreams.\" </p> <p>So if we want to create that Zen-like haven, should we paint our house in blocks of blue, green and violet? No. \"Too much of a single colour,\" explains Cumming, \"can in fact have a negative effect. Too much deep blue, for example, can slow us down so much that it makes us melancholy [so that's where the term 'the blues' comes from], so all colours must be balanced by their complementary colour.\" This means that a violet room must contain some intellectually stimulating yellow, while a blue room needs a splash (just a splash mind, too much will lead to confusion rather than calm) of orange, the colour of joy and physical activity. </p> <p>Of course, for some people, the suggestion that a blue sitting room, nicely balanced by the odd orange scatter cushion, can make you feel more relaxed is just a lot of alternative mumbo-jumbo. Forget energy flows, they say, a room feels good because it looks good, whether it's painted a peaceful lilac, a stark, clinical white, or a deep red with lots of geometric patterns (another no-no, according to the colour therapists, who believe that patterns should be gentle and related to nature if they are going to aid relaxation). </p> <p>Tricia Guild, founder of the interiors company Designers Guild, is a great believer in the power of pigment, but she is no colour therapist. Her approach is more personal. As she writes in the introduction to her book White Hot: Cool Colours For Modern Living (published by Quadrille, priced \u00a325), \"my response to colour has always been intensely personal and emotional. Colour theory and scientific explanations are not my ways of searching - I prefer intuitive responses.\" </p> <p>So, although she agrees with Cumming that a retreat-like home should be primarily decorated in colours from the cool end of the spectrum (she is particularly fond of aquamarine, a shade that she says \"radiates the peaceful, calming qualities of a still sea\"), she still has room for punches of hot shades such as red and magenta. </p> <p>The secret of making these bold colours work as part of a calming colour scheme, argues Guild, is white, \"the classic colour of simplicity\", which not only functions as a cool colour in its own right but also, she says, \"gives other colours room to breathe, to stop competing, to be themselves\". </p> <p>And that's exactly what those of us who daydream over those magazine images of peaceful havens are looking for - a living environment that allows us the space to be ourselves. We may or may not believe that painting the room in shades of aqua and white will achieve this, but we have to decorate our homes in some way, and surely common sense tells us that a subtle, cool palette will be more conducive to relaxation than a riot of clashing, bright colours. We may or may not believe that painting a wall lilac will improve our self-esteem, but it's hard to argue with the idea that it's easier to think straight in a harmoniously decorated home free from clutter. </p> <p>No doubt there will be some readers who remain unconvinced, who say they can relax perfectly well amid the piles of books, media equipment and collectibles that fill their brilliant-red sitting rooms - but a change of colour has got to be worth a try for those of us who need help unwinding at the end of the day. At any rate, I find painting quite therapeutic.</p>",

Colour theory and scientific explanations are not my ways of searching - I prefer intuitive responses.\" So, although she agrees with Cumming that a retreat-like home should be primarily decorated in colours from the cool end of the spectrum (she is particularly fond of aquamarine, a shade that she says \"radiates the peaceful, calming qualities of a still sea\"), she still has room for punches of hot shades such as red and magenta. The secret of making these bold colours work as part of a calming colour scheme, argues Guild, is white, \"the classic colour of simplicity\", which not only functions as a cool colour in its own right but also, she says, \"gives other colours room to breathe, to stop competing, to be themselves\". And that's exactly what those of us who daydream over those magazine images of peaceful havens are looking for - a living environment that allows us the space to be ourselves. We may or may not believe that painting the room in shades of aqua and white will achieve this, but we have to decorate our homes in some way, and surely common sense tells us that a subtle, cool palette will be more conducive to relaxation than a riot of clashing, bright colours. We may or may not believe that painting a wall lilac will improve our self-esteem, but it's hard to argue with the idea that it's easier to think straight in a harmoniously decorated home free from clutter. No doubt there will be some readers who remain unconvinced, who say they can relax perfectly well amid the piles of books, media equipment and collectibles that fill their brilliant-red sitting rooms - but a change of colour has got to be worth a try for those of us who need help unwinding at the end of the day. At any rate, I find painting quite therapeutic.",

      "body": "<p>Get cooking!\" Fern Britten's war cry sends the contestants on the popular TV show Ready Steady Cook into a flurry of activity, rush and bother. Quick cooking. Fast food. Dishes in 30 minutes, 15 minutes, five minutes. I want it now. NOW!</p> <p>Well, really. It's enough to make you reach for the nearest chilled dinner from the freezer chest. This obsession with speed, with instant food, small wonder that fewer people can be bothered to get into the kitchen with any regularity these days. \"Oh, I don't have time,\" they wail. Nonsense. You always have time for things you want to do. Instead of looking on cooking and shopping as a chore, you should treat them as therapy.</p> <p>Cooking is a refuge from the stress, press and mess of the world out there. You have no idea how soothing chopping an onion can be until you try it. Okay, there's some thought involved, and a bit of time, but so there is in learning to dance the tango, mowing the lawn or voting to expel someone from Big Brother. So it's time we learned to slow down, chill out and hang loose in the kitchen.</p> <p>There's no need to treat shopping as an ordeal, either. I don't mind admitting that I'm not too happy in supermarkets. In fact, I hardly ever go in them, but The Guv'nor said that it was time I did, and that I couldn't spend more than \u00a330 on a dinner for six people - \u00a35 a head! \"Make it cheap and make it easy,\" he said. \"I don't want to see anything that's going to give someone a nervous breakdown or keep them in the kitchen for a fortnight.\"</p> <p>So forth I went. God knows, supermarkets are unfun places to find the inspiration you need from good ingredients, but if you look on shopping in them as a kind of treasure hunt, it takes on a different hue. The Guv'nor had mentioned ceviche, so it seemed a suitable idea to whizz past the bags of salad and attend the fish counter. The mackerel looked really good, all electric blue, delicious, nutritious, cheap and perfect for ceviche. Ceviche is the totally stress-free method of preparing fish. You dunk fish chunks in lemon or lime juice, which, like, cooks it. It's a doddle, and it makes a great little starter.</p> <p>Next, the meat counter. Hmm. Respectable looking meat, and not under wraps, either. But I was on a budget. Then I saw a packet of organic mince. Not too fatty, and a nice red colour. Great for polpettone, that monument to slow cooking, a sublime meatloaf stuffed with cheese and delicately seasoned. But not everyone eats meat, so I needed some tomatoes for a lasagne. I turned back to the fruit-and-veg area, where I spied tomatoes of a so-so red, not that bad, but not that good. So, no tomatoes. Tinned would have to do.</p> <p>There were some nice-looking little waxy potatoes, however. Boiled, dressed in a little olive oil, a soft boiled egg, perhaps, some spring onions and chives to go with the polpettone? Some things are sacred, such as good eggs, so I sought out the organic ones.</p> <p>That left pudding, and I solved that with some nice seasonal plums, which would cook beautifully into an almondy paste in a tart. Then I spied some avocados to partner the ceviche. Some even had the odd black spot. Great! I gathered a few more bits, went to the flowers, then up to the wine before calling it quits.</p> <p>Needless to say, the bill flew over the \u00a330, but the food for the meal came in at not too far over, and, really, there's nothing to this supermarket shopping lark. Not much to the cooking of it, either. Lots can be done well ahead, so there's no last-minute bother. And when your guests ring that doorbell, there's not a bead of sweat on the brow, no nervous flutter in the tum, and no hint of rush or bother to be seen. Just you at peace with your kitchen, your food and yourself. That's proper cooking.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Ceviche</b></p> <p>With the fishing of salmon in an unholy state and the state of cod swiftly following suit, the prominence of mackerel will soon surface in a similar fashion to monkfish, which was once deemed fit only for pets. Quite right, too. The ceviche can be made several hours in advance.</p> <p><b> 6 small spanking fresh mackerel, or three larger ones, filleted <br> 1 red chilli<br> Juice of 3 lemons<br> Juice of 3 limes <br> 2 small red onions <br> 1 small handful coriander, picked <br> 3 very ripe avocados, if available</b></p> <p>A kindly fishmonger will fillet and remove the bones from the fish for you. Ceviche is normally sliced thinly, but I prefer to cut the fillets into three pieces only, especially if they are only small.</p> <p>Lay the prepared fish in a pretty earthenware dish, and pour over the lime juice. Peel and very finely chop the red onion and scatter this over the fish . Split the chilli lengthways, remove half its seeds (unless you like it devilishly hot, in which case leave them all in), and chop into a small dice, taking care not to touch your eyes (or any other sensitive body areas) with your 'chillied' hands. Add the chilli to the fish dish. Chop the coriander finely, and add to the dish. Liberally season the whole lot with sea salt, and mix together thoroughly. Cover the dish and refrigerate for a couple of hours.</p> <p>When ready to serve, halve and peel the avocados, cut the flesh into thick wedges and place on a plate. Pile the ceviche on top. Garnish with a few slices of chilli and/or red onion, as well as a few leaves of coriander.</p> <p><b> Polpettone</b></p> <p>Ma used to make this from Elizabeth David's splendid Italian Food. The only change I've made to her recipe is to omit hard-boiled egg in the stuffing - instead, I'd serve the meatloaf with one soft-boiled egg per person on top of a warm potato salad with mayonnaise, chives and spring onions.</p> <p><b> 900g good minced beef <br> 4 very fresh free-range eggs <br> 3 cloves garlic <br> 1 medium-sized onion <br> 1 small handful flat-leaf parsley, picked <br> Sea salt <br> Freshly-milled black pepper <br> 90g good ham, in two thick slices <br> 90g Provolone <br> Sea salt <br> Freshly-milled black pepper</b></p> <p>Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Wash, dry and finely chop the parsley. Put the minced beef in a large bowl, tip in the garlic, onion, parsley, salt and pepper, then the eggs. Mix well and put half the mixture into a suitable crock or loaf tin. Cut the ham and cheese into small pieces, and mix with salt and pepper. Lay in the middle of the layer of beef, and cover with the remaining beef mix. Push the mixture down with the heel of your hand, though with not too much force, and seal the crock with tin foil and a lid. Place the crock in a roasting tray, half-fill the tray with cold water, put it into a preheated, slow oven (150C/300F/gas mark 2) and cook for one-and-a-half hours. This is delicious hot, warm or cold, so the polpettone can be cooked at any time during the day, whenever suits you best.</p> <p>Apart from the potato-and-egg salad already mentioned, a green salad and a dish of thinly-sliced tomatoes dressed with olive oil, sea salt and pepper make happy eating with polpettone.</p> <p><b> Tomato and spinach lasagne</b></p> <p>Buy only the very best lasagne verde for this dish (or, of course, make your own).</p> <p><b> 24 fully-ripe, top-quality tomatoes, or a 250g tin <br> 4 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced thinly <br> Olive oil <br> 1.5kg washed and picked leaf spinach <br> 4 onions <br> Unsalted butter <br> Nutmeg <br> 300g lasagne verde (preferably fresh, but dry if necessary) <br> Fresh Parmesan</b></p> <p>For the b\u00e9chamel</p> <p><b> 700ml milk <br> 90g unsalted butter <br> 75g plain flour <br> 1 small sprig thyme <br> 12 black peppercorns <br> 1 bayleaf</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Remove the eye from the tomatoes, and cut them in half. Place the halves, cut-side up, on a roasting tray and put a thin slice of garlic on each. Liberally season with sea salt and milled black pepper. Anoint with some olive oil and transfer to the oven to cook for one-and-a-half to two hours. Remove the tomatoes from the oven, and turn up the temperature to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Set the tomatoes to one side.</p> <p>Put a big pan of water on to boil and salt it generously. Once the water is thrashing, tip in the spinach, pushing it well into the water so that all of it wilts under the force of the hot liquid. Cook for 30 seconds, then lift out with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl of iced water. Once the spinach is cool enough to handle, squeeze it dry. Peel and finely chop the onions, and cook them gently in the butter until soft. Roughly chop the spinach, and mix into the sweated onion mix, along with a very generous grating of nutmeg, some sea salt and freshly milled pepper. Set the spinach mixture to one side.</p> <p>Heat the milk in a saucepan. Melt the butter in a separate pot over a gentle heat, then stir in the flour. Let the roux cook for five minutes, stirring regularly, until it is pale gold in colour. Whisking all the while, start adding the milk bit by bit until all of it has been incorporated into the roux, and the bechamel is smooth - it should be the consistency of cream. Add the thyme, peppercorns and bayleaf, and set aside to infuse.</p> <p>Refill the pan of water, and bring it to the boil. Drop in the pasta: if fresh, it will need but a few minutes; dried will require considerably longer. Once cooked, drain the pasta in a colander and run cold water over it to halt the cooking process, else it will go soggy.</p> <p>Butter a handsome earthenware dish and lay out in it enough sheets of pasta just to cover the base. Spread some of the spinach mixture over the pasta, then some tomatoes, then ladle over some of the white sauce. Repeat these layers until everything has been used up, making sure that the top layer consists of b\u00e9chamel. Liberally grate Parmesan over the top, then place the lasagne in the oven for 15 minutes until just beginning to colour. When serving, offer more fresh Parmesan.</p> <p><b> Plum clafoutis</b></p> <p>This pudding is also very good when made with mirabelles or greengages.</p> <p><b> 340g ripe plums</b></p> <p>For the batter</p> <p><b> 20g toasted flaked almonds <br> 70ml Armagnac (or Cognac) <br> 55g caster sugar <br> Around 250ml milk - the exact amount will depend on how much alcohol the plums absorb<br> 3 fine free-range eggs <br> 1 tsp vanilla extract <br> 1 pinch salt <br> 70g plain flour</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Bring a pan of water to the boil, and drop in the plums for 10 seconds. Remove the fruit and, when cool enough to handle, peel it. Steep the whole peeled plums in the Armagnac and sugar for at least an hour. Drain the plums and put to one side. Pour the steeping juices into the liquidiser, then top up with enough milk to make up 280ml of liquid. Add the remaining batter ingredients, and blend for a minute.</p> <p>Put a two-litre earthenware dish in the oven to warm. Pour a thin layer of batter into the dish and let it set slightly. Sit the plums in the batter, and pour over the rest of the batter. Scatter the almonds on top, and cook until the clafoutis is slightly puffed and golden brown - around an hour. Lightly dust with icing sugar to finish</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is the chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.</p>",

Heat the milk in a saucepan. Melt the butter in a separate pot over a gentle heat, then stir in the flour. Let the roux cook for five minutes, stirring regularly, until it is pale gold in colour. Whisking all the while, start adding the milk bit by bit until all of it has been incorporated into the roux, and the bechamel is smooth - it should be the consistency of cream. Add the thyme, peppercorns and bayleaf, and set aside to infuse. Refill the pan of water, and bring it to the boil. Drop in the pasta: if fresh, it will need but a few minutes; dried will require considerably longer. Once cooked, drain the pasta in a colander and run cold water over it to halt the cooking process, else it will go soggy. Butter a handsome earthenware dish and lay out in it enough sheets of pasta just to cover the base. Spread some of the spinach mixture over the pasta, then some tomatoes, then ladle over some of the white sauce. Repeat these layers until everything has been used up, making sure that the top layer consists of b\u00e9chamel. Liberally grate Parmesan over the top, then place the lasagne in the oven for 15 minutes until just beginning to colour. When serving, offer more fresh Parmesan. Plum clafoutis This pudding is also very good when made with mirabelles or greengages. 340g ripe plums For the batter 20g toasted flaked almonds 70ml Armagnac (or Cognac) 55g caster sugar Around 250ml milk - the exact amount will depend on how much alcohol the plums absorb 3 fine free-range eggs 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 pinch salt 70g plain flour Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Bring a pan of water to the boil, and drop in the plums for 10 seconds. Remove the fruit and, when cool enough to handle, peel it. Steep the whole peeled plums in the Armagnac and sugar for at least an hour. Drain the plums and put to one side. Pour the steeping juices into the liquidiser, then top up with enough milk to make up 280ml of liquid. Add the remaining batter ingredients, and blend for a minute. Put a two-litre earthenware dish in the oven to warm. Pour a thin layer of batter into the dish and let it set slightly. Sit the plums in the batter, and pour over the rest of the batter. Scatter the almonds on top, and cook until the clafoutis is slightly puffed and golden brown - around an hour. Lightly dust with icing sugar to finish \u0095 Jeremy Lee is the chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.",

      "body": "<p>There is no great English wine, but there is one great English wine merchant. He is a useful chap for readers who find supermarkets stressful, wine shops a strain, and conventional wine merchants unbearable stuffy. He is a truly independent character who ships all his own wines, is on first-name terms with all his vignerons, writes his own wine list, and sleeps above the shop (okay, his bed is expectorating distance across the office yard). </p> <p>You may ask what such an individual is doing in this column. In fact, he has appeared once before, six years ago. I thus acknowledge my disgraceful neglect of Robin Yapp, of Yapp Brothers of Mere in Wiltshire, specialist in the Loire and the Rh\u00f4ne. </p> <p>His wines? They fitted my definition of superplonks when I first tasted them in March 1970, and not much has changed, except Robin has since got himself an excellent 15.5 point (out of 20) house champagne (\u00a315.95, from J Dumangin Fils), expanded into Provence, the Savoie, Alsace and Roussillon and - a truly startling innovation this - signed up the maker of Australia's most alcoholically intimidating shiraz (Ron Laughton, of Jasper Hill). Since Robin once told me that he found Australian wines industrially produced and \"not the passionate products of original minds\", Mr Laughton finds himself in choice company. But then his unbelievably demanding and heady Georgia's Paddock Shiraz 1998 rates 17 points and asks \u00a328.75 for the privilege of getting pissed on it. A little goes a long way with Georgia and, in comparison, she makes Grange Hermitage, the overrated Penfolds brand, appear a jejune joke. </p> <p>Robin's vignerons produce wines that have no appeal to the wine snob because they lack legendary status. Such wines are for the wine lover who values what the Spanish call duende - something with soul. The prices reflect the labour, love, skill, and personal committment put in to each wine, which is very different from sticking an impressive price tag on a bottle to excite the pulse and stimulate the purse of the shallow-minded status-symbol-seeker. </p> <p>Take the wines of Denis Ferrer and Bruno Ribiere, which can claim only humble Vins de Pays Catalan status. The Ferrer family has been vignerons for 600 years, and the vines that make the Carignan-graped Domaine Ferrer Ribiere Centenaire 1999 are 122 years old. Yet the result is a gorgeously fresh and vigorous red wine of panache and pertinacity. It rates 17 points and costs \u00a36.95. </p> <p>I have been lucky enough to taste some sublime Yapp reds. Paul &amp; Frederik Filliatreau's Saumur Champigny La Grande Vignolle (17 points, \u00a38.35) is a deliciously quaffable, superbly textured wine of lingering minerality. Michel Gigon's Thouarsais Breton 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a36.35) has tannins that dance on the tongue. Andre Vatan's Vin de Pays du Cher La Ronciere 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.60) is an unusual pinot noir with floral-scents and chewy tannins. Jean-Louis and Sylvie Grippat's Saint Joseph 1998 (17 points, \u00a313.95) has stunning richness, softness and ripeness. Jean-Marie Lombard's Brezeme Eugene de Monicault 1996 (17 points, \u00a311.25), a 100% syrah, is mature and softening on the taste buds and has an ineffable sense of completeness and rich complexity. Denis Cheron has turned out an exemplary Vacqueyras Cuv\u00e9e Sp\u00e9ciale 1995 (17 points, \u00a38.50) and it is a benchmark Ctes-du-Rhne with bitter cherry fruit, a controlled earthy undertone and a lovely texture. It makes for perfectly mature, serious drinking. Georges Vernay's Collines Rhodaniennes Syrah 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a37.60) is a delightfully piquant, savourily rich wine. Auguste and Pierre Clape's Ctes-du-Rhne Syrah 1999 (17 points, \u00a312.25) is fresher, being much younger and fiestier. The fruit has a hedgerow sweetness which stretches the palate as the dry tannins begin to bite. </p> <p>More unusual is Jacques Dalmasco's red Domaine de la Source Bellet 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a315) the white of which appellation, Bellet, is the house wine of Nice. The red, made from folle noir and grenache, is a delicious revelation of luxuriously textured plum/cherry/blackcurrant richness with a rousing, happy lilt on its finish. </p> <p>But even the gentle eccentricity and rarity of this wine must give way to Christine Campadieu's and Vincent Cantie's gloriously sexy Domaine La Tour Vieille Collioure 1998 (18 points, \u00a38.75) which has an absolutely captivating richness, wonderful tannins, huge fruit with spice and wild herb touches, and the whole fabulous construct has a gently baked quality to it, a possibly bequest of the generous French Catalan sun. </p> <p>On Yapp's white side, I enjoyed Jean-Baptiste Pinon's Jasnieres Les Truffieres 1989 (18.5 points, \u00a314.75) which is off-dry, curiously honied and subtly vegetal, and with a burnt-buttery and walnutty richness with the texture of ruffled satin. Gerard &amp; Jean-Louis Chave's Hermitage 1997 (16 points, \u00a340) is remarkably textured, aromatic and nutty and has a compelling, almost malt-whisky tang to it. Monsieur Lombard has a white Brezeme, a great rarity, and his 1998 (17 points, \u00a313.50) has a graceful oily texture and a peach and dry honey undertone.

      "bodyText": "There is no great English wine, but there is one great English wine merchant. He is a useful chap for readers who find supermarkets stressful, wine shops a strain, and conventional wine merchants unbearable stuffy. He is a truly independent character who ships all his own wines, is on first-name terms with all his vignerons, writes his own wine list, and sleeps above the shop (okay, his bed is expectorating distance across the office yard). You may ask what such an individual is doing in this column. In fact, he has appeared once before, six years ago. I thus acknowledge my disgraceful neglect of Robin Yapp, of Yapp Brothers of Mere in Wiltshire, specialist in the Loire and the Rh\u00f4ne. His wines? They fitted my definition of superplonks when I first tasted them in March 1970, and not much has changed, except Robin has since got himself an excellent 15.5 point (out of 20) house champagne (\u00a315.95, from J Dumangin Fils), expanded into Provence, the Savoie, Alsace and Roussillon and - a truly startling innovation this - signed up the maker of Australia's most alcoholically intimidating shiraz (Ron Laughton, of Jasper Hill). Since Robin once told me that he found Australian wines industrially produced and \"not the passionate products of original minds\", Mr Laughton finds himself in choice company. But then his unbelievably demanding and heady Georgia's Paddock Shiraz 1998 rates 17 points and asks \u00a328.75 for the privilege of getting pissed on it. A little goes a long way with Georgia and, in comparison, she makes Grange Hermitage, the overrated Penfolds brand, appear a jejune joke. Robin's vignerons produce wines that have no appeal to the wine snob because they lack legendary status. Such wines are for the wine lover who values what the Spanish call duende - something with soul. The prices reflect the labour, love, skill, and personal committment put in to each wine, which is very different from sticking an impressive price tag on a bottle to excite the pulse and stimulate the purse of the shallow-minded status-symbol-seeker. Take the wines of Denis Ferrer and Bruno Ribiere, which can claim only humble Vins de Pays Catalan status. The Ferrer family has been vignerons for 600 years, and the vines that make the Carignan-graped Domaine Ferrer Ribiere Centenaire 1999 are 122 years old. Yet the result is a gorgeously fresh and vigorous red wine of panache and pertinacity. It rates 17 points and costs \u00a36.95. I have been lucky enough to taste some sublime Yapp reds. Paul &amp; Frederik Filliatreau's Saumur Champigny La Grande Vignolle (17 points, \u00a38.35) is a deliciously quaffable, superbly textured wine of lingering minerality. Michel Gigon's Thouarsais Breton 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a36.35) has tannins that dance on the tongue. Andre Vatan's Vin de Pays du Cher La Ronciere 1998 (16 points, \u00a36.60) is an unusual pinot noir with floral-scents and chewy tannins. Jean-Louis and Sylvie Grippat's Saint Joseph 1998 (17 points, \u00a313.95) has stunning richness, softness and ripeness. Jean-Marie Lombard's Brezeme Eugene de Monicault 1996 (17 points, \u00a311.25), a 100% syrah, is mature and softening on the taste buds and has an ineffable sense of completeness and rich complexity. Denis Cheron has turned out an exemplary Vacqueyras Cuv\u00e9e Sp\u00e9ciale 1995 (17 points, \u00a38.50) and it is a benchmark Ctes-du-Rhne with bitter cherry fruit, a controlled earthy undertone and a lovely texture. It makes for perfectly mature, serious drinking. Georges Vernay's Collines Rhodaniennes Syrah 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a37.60) is a delightfully piquant, savourily rich wine. Auguste and Pierre Clape's Ctes-du-Rhne Syrah 1999 (17 points, \u00a312.25) is fresher, being much younger and fiestier. The fruit has a hedgerow sweetness which stretches the palate as the dry tannins begin to bite. More unusual is Jacques Dalmasco's red Domaine de la Source Bellet 1998 (17.5 points, \u00a315) the white of which appellation, Bellet, is the house wine of Nice. The red, made from folle noir and grenache, is a delicious revelation of luxuriously textured plum/cherry/blackcurrant richness with a rousing, happy lilt on its finish. But even the gentle eccentricity and rarity of this wine must give way to Christine Campadieu's and Vincent Cantie's gloriously sexy Domaine La Tour Vieille Collioure 1998 (18 points, \u00a38.75) which has an absolutely captivating richness, wonderful tannins, huge fruit with spice and wild herb touches, and the whole fabulous construct has a gently baked quality to it, a possibly bequest of the generous French Catalan sun. On Yapp's white side, I enjoyed Jean-Baptiste Pinon's Jasnieres Les Truffieres 1989 (18.5 points, \u00a314.75) which is off-dry, curiously honied and subtly vegetal, and with a burnt-buttery and walnutty richness with the texture of ruffled satin. Gerard &amp; Jean-Louis Chave's Hermitage 1997 (16 points, \u00a340) is remarkably textured, aromatic and nutty and has a compelling, almost malt-whisky tang to it. Monsieur Lombard has a white Brezeme, a great rarity, and his 1998 (17 points, \u00a313.50) has a graceful oily texture and a peach and dry honey undertone. This is one of those uncommon white wines which works like a red, which to say that it has layers of subtle flavours which permit close examination over several hours, as the bottle empties and the mind fills. Robin's list contains several interesting sweet white wines with a depth and a personality that does not consign them to playing second fiddle to dessert. The one I admire most is Michel and Laurent Berger's Montlouis Grains Nobles 1990 (17 points, \u00a317.95) which, though lively now, has 25 years of development in it. By 2025, the layers of butterscotch richness will have become so concentrated you could consume the wine with a spoon. Now be aware that I have only quoted single bottle prices and you can only sensibly buy a single bottle if you visit Mere. Yapp Brothers deals in cases sales - two cases and above being delivered free (large quantities attract a discount, as do cases collected by the purchaser from Mere personally, which I recommend visiting as it has a charming church, St Michael's, with some medieval stained-glass vaut le detour). You can telephone Yapp Brothers on 01747 860423, email them on sales@yapp.co.uk, fax them on 01747 860929, and access the website on www.yapp.co.uk. The wine list alone is worth leafing through.

Or at all, unless you have a thing about flatpacks. 27 Delegate up and down, at home and at work. 28 Buy presents and cards when you see them, not in a panic the day before. 29 Take your name off the junk mail lists - contact the Mailing Preference Service on 0845 703 4599 and your name will be removed from 95% of direct mailing lists. 30 The law of housework: disorder matters more than dust. 31 Work late if you really must, but don't ever take work home with you. 32 Coordinate your wardrobe, it will make picking and choosing much easier. 33 Don't eat in the street. 34 Retire from work as soon as you can afford to (see page 85, How To Retire). 35 Shop locally, rather than in huge, busy, out-of-town hypermarkets. 36 Watch TV only if there's something you desperately want to see. 37 Have fewer meetings. 38 Forget about ego and status - buy a slow car and enjoy the journey. 39 Unless you really have become 'friends', don't keep in touch with ex boyfriends or girlfriends - the experience will only bring you down. 40 If you have a mobile phone, keep it switched off most of the time. If people think you're always available, they'll call you even more. 41 Have a small, pocket-sized diary, rather than a hefty tome - it will encourage you to keep appointments to a minimum. 42 Clear your home of clutter every couple of months. 43 Before you visit a shop, call ahead to check they have what you're looking for. 44 Make a list of things to do - then cut it in half. 45 Let the phone ring a few times before you answer it. 46 Spend time listening to music - just listening to it, not doing the dusting at the same time. 47 Pay bills by direct debit. 48 Don't drink and drive, you'll enjoy neither. 49 Try to avoid rush hour. 50 Don't go to the video shop; try the library instead. 51 Make double quantities of items that freeze well, such as stock and pastry. 52 Leave your answer-phone off when you go away on holiday. Or better still, don't have an answer-phone at all. 53 Dab lavender oil on your pillow - it helps you sleep. 54 Buy a comfortable sofa. 55 Don't buy clothes that say 'dry clean only' on the label. 56 When you're calling an automated answering service, and you're told, 'If you have a touch-tone phone, press 2', don't press it. Instead, pretend you have an old-style analogue phone. You'll go straight through to an operator. 57 Take siestas. 58 Always put your keys in the same place when you get home. 59 Better 30 minutes too late in this world than 30 years too early in the next. 60 Throw away any clothes you haven't worn for the past two years. Or take them to the charity shop. 61 Train children at an early age to do their share of the Hoovering, washing up, sheet changing and other chores. 62 Get a proper set of screwdrivers rather than struggling with a knife to change a plug. 63 Open your emails only three times a day. 64 Remember that wasting time refreshes the soul. 65 Get the ringback facility added to your phone (call the Customer Services number for your network provider), then you need never again waste time waiting for others to come off the line. 66 Do one thing at a time. 67 Avoid hangovers, unless you have the time to indulge them. 68 Hang up your clothes when you take them off. 69 Write real letters and postcards, don't just send email. 70 Plan ahead - but leave time to be spontaneous. 71 Keep laundered duvet covers inside-out, so that they're easier to put on when changing the bed linen. 72 Either get unpleasant tasks out of the way at a once - or procrastinate shamelessly. You choose. 73 Work out if you could afford to work part-time, and consider it. 74 Walk. 75 If you want to spend more time doing something you're good at, and less doing chores for which you lack the skills or inclination, join a LETS (Local Exchange Trading Scheme) in your area - where people exchange goods or services (for example, you weed my garden, I'll paint your roof) without the need for money. Contact Letslink UK on www.letslinkuk.demon.co.uk or write to 54 Campbell Road, Southsea, Hampshire PO5 1RW, tel 01705 730639. Or try www.oneworld.org/letslinklondon if you live in the capital. 76 Play Myst or Riven, not Tomb Raider or Carmageddon. 77 Always carry a book, crossword, knitting, pogo stick, whatever, so that you can enjoy the time you spend waiting. 78 Spend 10 minutes a day doing absolutely nothing. 79 Do you really want that promotion? Or might you enjoy your life more without it? 80 Learn to swim slowly - it's better for mind, body and soul. See www.art-of-swimming.com 81 Share childcare with friends and family. 82 Spend time alone - if you can get some. 83 Don't iron, unless you love it. Or else buy clothes that don't need ironing. 84 Sit quietly for a few moments before you eat. It will help you appreciate your food. 85 Leave a party early if it's not fun - an engagement is only a social one if you're enjoying yourself. 86 Forget about using motorways. 87 Go to lunch early or late - and avoid queues in the sandwich bar. 88 If someone asks 'Can I help?' and you could use it, say yes. 89 Take all the time off from work that you're entitled to. 90 Change and shower after work, to wash away the day and separate work and home. 91 Save drafts of frequently-used email/fax/letter formats. 92 Take the train or bus to work; don't drive. 93 Book your train tickets by phone (0845 748 4950) or on the internet (www.thetrainline.com). Ditto for your cinema and theatre tickets, then go straight to the front of the queue (try www.halfpricetheatretickets.com or www.firstcalltickets.com). 94 Give yourself a treat at least once a week. 95 Don't get impatient waiting for a crowded lift - take the stairs. 96 Always take your lunch break. 97 Daydream. 98 Drive in the slow lane. 99 Think before you talk, or act. 100 Say no more. 101 But say yes, too.",

If you want to find the clock capital of Britain now, you have go to Teddington, Middlesex, to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), where Dr John Laverty and his team of eight scientists check the three caesium clocks that send out the national radio time signal from Rugby.

There, an average is taken from 200 atomic clocks in labs around the world. Each month, a report is sent back to the time labs such as NPL or Washington to let them know how close their clocks are to the average. 'If I'm 10 nanoseconds out, we have a problem,' says Dr Matsakis. However, as his lab provides 60 atomic clocks - approximately 40% of the world total compared with the UK's 3 or 4% - he can, of course, set the average. Why does it matter? GPS [Global Positioning Systems] satellites, for instance, are time-coordinated - and if one is even a nanosecond out, you could miss by feet. </p> <p>It's certainly a weird career area. 'I was a real child of the space age,' says 50-year-old Dr Matsakis, who grew up with one eye peering through a telescope at the stars and has just been voted vice-chair of the prestigious International Astronomical Union's commission on time. </p> <p>They get together every few months at time conventions to write equations on the back of napkins and discuss projects, such as 'redefining the second'. This is important because the world is not as exact as the atomic clock, and often moves faster or slower - at present, every so often 'leap seconds' are inserted into the year. </p> <p>'The thing about time,' says Dr Laverty, at 36, a relative newcomer, 'is that everyone is so young - even when they're close to retirement'.

It's the holy grail of time.' </p> <p>NPL is now a 'GOCO' centre in the jargon of Whitehall, ie, Government Owned, Contractor Operated. The time has officially been privatised.

With tenets such as 'When you die, your in-box won't be empty', 'Allow yourself to be bored' and 'Make peace with imperfection', this champion coper has become a bestselling author - it comes as no surprise to find that another of his books bears the title Don't Worry, Make Money.",

      "body": "<p>It's early Sunday morning in SoHo, and downtown New York is beginning to wake up. On the wooden benches in front of Jean Claude's, a restaurant so rough-hewn and thoroughly French that it might have been airlifted from Aix-en-Provence, bleary-eyed punters are sifting lazily through the mammoth New York Times. </p> <p>Turning down Prince Street, Tan Dun, China's best-known contemporary composer, looks every inch the archetypal SoHo inhabitant. Despite just stepping off a long flight from Beijing, he looks rested and relaxed, ambling along in sandals with abrown paper bag tucked under his arm: \"Not many Asian artists really love or even experience this kind of environment,\" he says, pointing out various \"hot\" galleries hidden behind the postindustrial facades of the buildings. \"Of all of my generation who moved to the States, I am the only person really working and living in New York as a normal New Yorker. I don't have any distance with the local people here. The culture is my culture. This is my home...\" </p> <p>Yet Tan Dun's origins couldn't lie further away from this modish corner of Manhattan. Over breakfast in his minimalist white-on-white apartment, he slips a cassette into the VCR, a documentary account for Chinese TV of his recent research trip to Hunan, the rural district of China where he was born and spent his early life. </p> <p>In the opening shot, framed against a lake and a traditional Chinese wooden pavilion, he announces: \"The most important thing in our lives is always to keep thinking about where we came from. Only then will we know where we are going.\" He goes on to detail a childhood immersed in the \"shamanism and magic\" of a rural village, an adolescence toiling in the rice fields during Mao's Cultural Revolution and a musical background so suffused with Chinese folk values that until the age of 20 he had \"never heard uttered the names of Beethoven, Mozart or Bach\". The camera pans across jagged, mist-enshrouded mountains. It cuts to a lavishly costumed Taoist ceremony performed by octogenarian monks. The monks play \"sheng\" mouth organs, elaborate bamboo instruments that issue a dank, sweet whine, and \"po\" hand cymbals, which work up a delightful clatter. The finale is the \"feast of 100 dishes\", in which every family in the village brings along a course, and on the screen Tan, now tipsy on home-made wine, sings comically with the local schoolgirl choir. </p> <p>Tan Dun's journey between these two contrasting worlds - Hunan Province and NY State, as far east and west as it is possible to travel culturally and spiritually - is perhaps one of the most extraordinary success stories in modern classical music. From what he says was a starting point of blissful ignorance of the international canon, Tan has now established himself as one of the most sought-after composers in the world. From entertaining peasants in the auditorium of the rice field, he has graduated to some of music's most prestigious venues: Lincoln Centre, Carnegie Hall, the Barbican. </p> <p>The same global cultural contrasts are evident in Tan Dun's remarkably diverse body of music, which Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu has described as \"violent as a burst of human blood, yet full of grace\". From Hunan comes the palette of sounds and timbres, the traditional Chinese instruments and the incantatory, contorted vocal techniques, employed to powerful effect in works such as the ritual opera Nine Songs. From urban New York we get the hip-hop rhythms, industrial guitars and samplers that propelled his hi-tech, thrash-aesthetic reinterpretation of Peony Pavilion, the classic 16th-century kunju opera. Hunan again provides the philosophical underpinnings, particularly the Taoist view of art as \"reverberations with the vital forces in nature\". Meanwhile, from the urban wellspring of New York comes the pure spirit of downtown experimentalism so evident in Soundshape and The Pink. \"What is very little heard in European or western music is the presence of sound as the voice of nature,\" commented John Cage, who was a huge influence on Tan's early US work. \"It is clear in the music of Tan Dun that sounds are central to the nature in which we live but to which we have too long not listened. In Tan Dun's music, the east and the west come together as our one home.\" </p> <p>Finally, from its sheer diversity, and the necessity of communicating to listeners perched on the very extremities of human civilization, comes Tan Dun's mass appeal. His Heaven Earth Mankind (Symphony 1997), commissioned for the Hong Kong handover, was made into a video for MTV. And his soundtrack for Ang Lee's Chinese-language film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival - has already shifted 200,000 copies in the east. </p> <p>His place on the global music stage is confirmed by the Tan Dun Festival which opens at the Barbican on September 28. Entitled Fire Crossing Water, it will feature UK premieres of his new work Water Passion as well as the score to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. </p> <p>However, the reaction to his work has been far from universally positive. Some Chinese composers have dismissed him as \"not serious\". The New York Times has printed scathing reviews, many of them by the music critic Bernard Holland, who has written: \"He is like the proverbial boy locked in a pastry shop, gorging indiscriminately on everything around him.\" Tan Dun responds: \"He says that I am always trying to mix wine and beer. I think he is crazy. Eventually we will all realise one day that there never were any boundaries, except those of man. All music is created by God.\"</p> <p> But Tan's moments of solemnity are usually immediately undermined by a mischievous streak: \"He's always been a spontaneously funny guy,\" says director Ang Lee, who has known him since the late 1980s. \"Whereas most of the other Asians in New York were generally quite shy and reserved, he could keep you entertained for hours singing some hilarious Hunan village song about how the farmer was feeling up the pigs and stroking their tits.\" He is also an excellent raconteur: \"Often you will find yourself going for lunch with Tan Dun,\" says Avril MacRory of the BBC, which co-commissioned his 2000 Today: A World Symphony for the Millennium, \"and returning at nine or 10 in the evening.\"</p> <p> However, Tan Dun's playful, imaginative ability to turn any situation into an entertaining anecdote has also earned him criticism. While his stories of shamanistic culture are voraciously devoured by those who have known him only in the west, many of his more cross-cultural acquaintances mutter about \"exaggeration\" and \"embellishment\". \"Tan Dun is a completely urban person,\" says Zhou Long, a fellow composer who has known him since his early days at the Beijing conservatory. \"He's not really from the village. He is from Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province. Sometimes, when you do promotion, you make stories. There is nothing wrong with that. If you are writing some biographical notes you can do that.\" </p> <p>There would seem to be a certain amount of evidence to support this view. One example might be the Chinese TV documentary, which was shot not in his home locality but deep in the countryside, a plane journey away. The actual village where Tan Dun spent some of his childhood has long since been swallowed up by the Changsha suburbs. Tan Dun's reaction to these assertions is both conciliatory and indignant: \"Perhaps they are right. Perhaps I am an urban person. I did spend some of of my time in the city. But anyone who says that I didn't also experience the culture of the countryside, then that is an insult to me and my background. They didn't come with me to live in a small village. They didn't come with me to be re-educated in the rice fields. How can they know how I lived my life?\" </p> <p>Tan Dun was born in 1957 in the central Chinese district of Hunan, the only son of Tan Xiang Qiu, a military officer in the People's Liberation Army, and Fang Qun Ying, then a doctor working in a Hunanese hospital. In the traditional manner, his first name, Dun, meaning \"shield\", comes last, though in the west he likes to be casually referred to as Tan. While his official publisher's biography - reproduced in most articles and interviews - cites the precise birthplace as the village of Si Mao, according to his father, Tan Dun was actually born in a military hospital on the outskirts of Changsha, now a rather grimy industrial regional capital of more than a million people. As was common Chinese practice for a busy working couple, his father and mother sent young Tan Dun off to live with his grandmother in the satellite village of Si Mao Chung, about 20 miles outside the city centre. </p> <p>Tan Dun recalls the environment in the village as \"very barbaric, very shamanistic, very mystic, very sacred, filled with traditional art forms, poetry and music... Like all the people of Hunan, the villagers were very secretive, very strange and completely devoted to their secret beliefs.\" It was this mystical environment, he says, that provided him with his first musical experiences, primarily through esoteric local rituals.</p> <p> \"From the local people, I started learning how to play Chinese folk instruments, bamboo flutes and the 'erhu' two-string fiddle. It was very natural. Music was simply part of life, in local kunju theatre or shamanistic ritual, mostly at weddings and funerals.\" </p> <p>When he returned to the city, at what he says was the age of nine, his musical education continued when a teacher presented him with an decrepit old violin: \"It only had three strings and as I had no money to replace it, I treated it like a three-stringed fiddle.\" By now, however, Mao's cultural revolution was getting into full swing and soon Tan Dun's parents were sent off to be re-educated in the countryside, his father by cleaning out the animal sheds on a farm, his mother to become what was known as a \"barefoot doctor\" among the peasants. At the age of 17, Tan Dun followed them to be re-educated in the rice fields of the Huangjin commune, about 50 miles outside Changsha. </p> <p>Ironically, Mao's policy - which, Deng Xiaoping later said, caused \"grave misfortunes\" for China - turned out to be a real re-education for Tan Dun, who had now fully formed in his mind the ambition of one day becoming a composer: \"In the daytime I would be planting rice in the fields for 10 hours, 12 hours,\" he recalls. \"But in the evening I would direct all farmers in a kind of rural orchestra using their cooking pots and whatever else they can use. We had no money so most of our instruments were pots, branches of trees, bits of bamboo. I began also to collect many, many folk songs.\" </p> <p>After two years of backbreaking work on the commune, by a macabre stroke of luck for Tan, the entire orchestra of the Changsha Peking Opera were drowned in a boating accident and officials were sent out to the communes to recruit trained musicians. He spent a year fiddling his way up through the ranks of the orchestra, then the death of Chairman Mao brought the cultural revolution to an abrupt halt. As traditional educational establishments opened once more, Tan Dun was among the 40,000 applicants for places at the Beijing conservatory, with 400 competing for just eight places on the composers' course. </p> <p>The entrance exam lasted a full week and covered everything from mathematics to Marxist theory to orchestration and harmony: \"I'd never been trained. I was little more than a farmer; I had never seen a piano or any of those fancy instruments. So I did everything according to my first instinct.\" On the final day came the aural: \"The examining professor asked me to play some Mozart,\" says Tan. \"And I said, 'Who is Mozart?' And he shook his head and said, 'Ohhhh my God!' And then he said, 'All right. Play some Bach.' And I said, 'What? Bach? I never heard of Bach.' And he said, 'What about Beethoven?' And I said, 'Sorry, I cannot. I am from Hunan; I don't know who Beethoven is.' So I suggested that I just improvise a little and he said, 'OK'. I took out my violin, which had only three strings on it, and I improvised for an hour. He was really shocked. Then there was a really big debate. And against every professor in the selection committee, he argued that I should be taken on the course.\" </p> <p>This last anecdote is a particular favourite, repeated in various forms in interviews. Sometimes he improvises on his three-stringed violin for two hours, often as long as three. On other occasions he is even more versatile: \"They asked me to sing,\" he told one publication, \"and I could sing 300 folk songs from Hunan, Szechuan, Tibet, all over. They accepted me because I was a little shaman.\" </p> <p>How much actual \"shamanism and magic\" really went on in the village where he grew up with his grandmother is far from clear: singer Chen Shi-Zheng, who also grew up in Changsha, contends that \"every grandmother there is a shaman\", but Tan's fellow Beijing conservatory students, some of whom grew up in neighbouring regions, cast doubt on this. Chinese shamanism is much more strongly associated with the north of China and Mongolia. </p> <p>His father, Tan Xiang Qiu, confirms that it was in the village that Tan Dun's love of music was ignited and divulges that his son would continually play the violin \"until the skin under his jaw was hard and callused\". But in Tan Xiang Qui's account, his son returned to the city at the age of six, not nine as Tan claims, and he also paints a picture of influences rather less traditional and shamanistic. </p> <p>According to Tan Xiang Qiu, far from being primitive or ignorant, his son's traditional formal musical education was quite advanced for provincial China at that time: by the age of 14 he had mastered Chinese notation and a little later travelled to Beijing to meet the com poser Hua Lu Bin, expressly for the purpose of studying western music. It is difficult to believe that this quest for western musical knowledge might not have included at least some mention of Mozart or Bach. </p> <p>As for the infamous audition at the Beijing conservatory, the examining professor, Li Xian, who would go on to become Tan Dun's mentor, recalls none of the events or details mentioned in the anecdote; not the questions about Beethoven or Bach, nor the three-stringed violin, nor the one- to three-hour session of traditional improvisation: \"Two hours? No, that would have been impossible,\" he says stiffly. \"Each student was allocated a specific amount of time for the tests. The maximum would have been about 20 minutes.\" </p> <p>While Tan Dun actually gave a rather lacklustre performance at a very straightforward audition, it was his sparkling piano trio, the evocatively entitled I Dreamt of Chairman Mao, based on traditional Hunanese folk music, that earned him his place at the conservatory. </p> <p>So, in September 1978, he packed his belongings - \"a bamboo pole over my shoulder,\" he says, \"one side wrapped up with my clothes, on the other side my scores\" - and left Changsha to join the composers' class. Almost immediately, Tan was marked out by the eccentricity of his musical vision: \"He always used influences in his music from his own daily life,\" remembers Li Xian. \"He would use in his music the voice of the stones, or something falling on the floor, or a cup being struck: noises normal people don't manage to use or even hear. If someone crushed a can of drink in order to put it in the trash can, he would replicate the action to hear the noise again. Then he would introduce that sound into his music.\" </p> <p>After a visit in 1979 to China by a Japanese troupe who used traditional Japanese instruments to make contemporary music, Tan Dun began applying the same principle to Chinese instruments and music. One of the fruits of this approach was his first symphony Li Sao, inspired by a fourth century BC melancholic poem. The piece, whose title translates as On Encountering Sorrow, featured traditional instruments and caused some controversy. His next major work, the string quartet Feng Ya Song, came second in Dresden's Weber Prize, making Tan Dun the first Chinese com poser to win an international prize since 1949. The Dresden victory had an immediate effect on Tan's career, propelling him to the forefront of the \"new wave\" of Chinese composers, but his music was denounced by the state in its renewed campaign against \"spiritual pollution\". </p> <p>Once the political storm had passed, Tan Dun made a request to continue his studies at Columbia, and permission was granted. So, in 1986, he took a flight from Beijing to New York and touched down in what would become his adopted homeland. \"I took the subway from the airport to Manhattan,\" he recalls, \"and I immediately understood that it wasn't at all the place I had imagined. I saw many people in the subway car, and they were all different colours. I asked myself, 'What country is this?' \" </p> <p>However, Tan soon tired of Columbia University. \"I immediately wanted to get away from the kind of depressing, bitter, atonal, selfish and superintellectual post-post-whatever music I was being forced to write there.\" Columbia soon reciprocally tired of him, and the professors there display a simmering animosity towards him that continues to this day: \"He was actually a very nice guy. He was a very good raconteur and I remember he was telling me stories from China that were perfectly human and very entertaining,\" says Columbia lecturer Mario Davidovsky. \"But he was at that point enormously involved in promoting himself and his career. And he was much more interested in that than anything that might have been going on at the university.\" </p> <p>As Columbia was only paying his fees, he had to earn money to live. \"I worked in restaurants and played my fiddle on the streets of Greenwich Village. That was my biggest classroom and in some way it was very close to my village in China, with its ritual music and its religion.\" </p> <p>At the first opportunity, he moved from the university dormitories into the basement of a brownstone in Chinatown, began to attend cutting-edge performance works and gradually became part of an artistic Greenwich Village set that included Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Meredith Monk. It was also about this time that Tan Dun first met John Cage and his music became, as he puts it, \"Cagealised\": \"Though I had been using incidental noises and found instruments since I was living in the village, of course I never thought of it as avant garde. But he was doing what I had done in the countryside 20 years previously.\" </p> <p>When Tan Dun decided that he wanted to launch himself into this world, he turned to his landlady, Mary Scherbatskoy, who had previously been a producer of dance. \"He just asked me casually one day if I'd like to produce an opera. And he showed me the score, and it was quite astonishing. But of course, being Chinese he wanted a cast of thousands. Eventually, I got him down to nine.\" The piece, Nine Songs, also based on Chinese poetry, used traditional ceramic Chinese instruments and opened with an extended sample of Tan Dun's shamanistic wailing. It was a sensation when performed at the Pace Downtown Theatre in May 1989. </p> <p>Tan Dun went on to produce a number of experimental performance-based and dance pieces: Soundshape in 1990 at the Guggenheim Museum, which included an entire village orchestra cast in ceramic, and The Pink in 1993, which included a cast of naked dancers playing instruments constructed entirely out of paper or cardboard. It was at the last of these, in which Tan Dun also performed as the naked conductor, that he first met his future wife, Jane Huang, then editor of a New York-based Chinese fashion magazine: \"After the show we all went to a bar . . . Immediately, he began paying me a lot of attention - I had a stomach upset and he went to the trouble of trying to get the waitress to get me some milk. Then suddenly, he said to me, 'Would you like to come to Tibet with me?' I didn't know what to say, I was absolutely shocked. I had completely misheard the question and thought he said to me, 'Would you like to come to bed with me?' But in fact we did end up going to Tibet very soon afterwards. We wanted to get married in the mountains. It was a very quick romance.\" Because of laws barring overseas Chinese from marrying in China, they had to settle for a tower-block register office in Hong Kong. They now have an two-year-old son, Ian. </p> <p>By this time, Tan Dun's reputation was beginning to cross over into the mainstream. An association with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra was the catalyst for the Orchestral Theatre series, four instalments of experimental gimmickry (part II saw the audience join in with trance-like chanting) multimedia (part III was set against a newsreel ranging from the Beatles to Mao's revolution) and a full orchestral score. The Edinburgh Festival commissioned Tan Dun's phenomenal Marco Polo, which featured a \"postmodern\" libretto by New York Times music critic Paul Griffith in which Marco and Polo appear as two characters/singers representing the yin/yang, east/west boundaries of modern culture. </p> <p>\"I don't really have any great interest in the east and the west as a dialogue,\" Tan Dun says. \"What I am interested in is trying to find a single language and distinctive style that is made up of many, many cultures and that can reach from many different diverse cultures.\" It is ironic that, in pursuit of this goal, he feels he needs to play up the primitive aspects of his background to such a degree, though in fact, the emphasis of his biographical details probably says more about the need for modern composers to distinguish themselves as much in their press packs as in their work. </p> <p>However, Tan Dun will ultimately be judged not on his life story but on his music, and in this area he still has a great deal to offer: \"One of the things I like about pop music is its accessibility and power. There, music just becomes the art of dancing together, performing together. And I think that if you can find that same international communicable quality, and somehow combine it with a very distinct personality and a very local and a very, very inward point of view, then you can smash the world.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Born:</strong> August 8 1957, Changsha, Hunan, China. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Beijing conservatory, 1978-85; Columbia University, 1986-89. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> Jane Huang, 1994 (one son, Ian, aged two years). </p> <p><strong> Operas: </strong> Nine Songs, 1989; Marco Polo, 1993-4; Peony Pavilion, 1998; Tea Opera, to be premiered in 2001. </p> <p><strong> Orchestral works:</strong> Li Sao, 1979; Feng Ya Song, 1983; On Taoism, 1985; Orchestral Theatre I-IV, 1990-1999; Death and Fire: Dialogue with Paul Klee,1992; Ghost Opera (with Kronos quartet), 1995; Heaven Earth Mankind (Symphony 1997), 1997; 2000 Today: A World Symphony for the New Millennium, 1999; Water Passion after St Matthew, 2000. </p> <p><strong> Experimental performance work: </strong> Soundshape, 1990; Silent Earth, 1991; Jo-Ha-Kyu, 1992; The Pink, 1993. </p> <p><strong> Awards: </strong> Weber Prize, second place, 1983; Suntory Prize, 1992; Grawemeyer Award, 1998.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's early Sunday morning in SoHo, and downtown New York is beginning to wake up. On the wooden benches in front of Jean Claude's, a restaurant so rough-hewn and thoroughly French that it might have been airlifted from Aix-en-Provence, bleary-eyed punters are sifting lazily through the mammoth New York Times. Turning down Prince Street, Tan Dun, China's best-known contemporary composer, looks every inch the archetypal SoHo inhabitant. Despite just stepping off a long flight from Beijing, he looks rested and relaxed, ambling along in sandals with abrown paper bag tucked under his arm: \"Not many Asian artists really love or even experience this kind of environment,\" he says, pointing out various \"hot\" galleries hidden behind the postindustrial facades of the buildings. \"Of all of my generation who moved to the States, I am the only person really working and living in New York as a normal New Yorker. I don't have any distance with the local people here. The culture is my culture. This is my home...\" Yet Tan Dun's origins couldn't lie further away from this modish corner of Manhattan. Over breakfast in his minimalist white-on-white apartment, he slips a cassette into the VCR, a documentary account for Chinese TV of his recent research trip to Hunan, the rural district of China where he was born and spent his early life. In the opening shot, framed against a lake and a traditional Chinese wooden pavilion, he announces: \"The most important thing in our lives is always to keep thinking about where we came from. Only then will we know where we are going.\" He goes on to detail a childhood immersed in the \"shamanism and magic\" of a rural village, an adolescence toiling in the rice fields during Mao's Cultural Revolution and a musical background so suffused with Chinese folk values that until the age of 20 he had \"never heard uttered the names of Beethoven, Mozart or Bach\". The camera pans across jagged, mist-enshrouded mountains. It cuts to a lavishly costumed Taoist ceremony performed by octogenarian monks. The monks play \"sheng\" mouth organs, elaborate bamboo instruments that issue a dank, sweet whine, and \"po\" hand cymbals, which work up a delightful clatter. The finale is the \"feast of 100 dishes\", in which every family in the village brings along a course, and on the screen Tan, now tipsy on home-made wine, sings comically with the local schoolgirl choir. Tan Dun's journey between these two contrasting worlds - Hunan Province and NY State, as far east and west as it is possible to travel culturally and spiritually - is perhaps one of the most extraordinary success stories in modern classical music. From what he says was a starting point of blissful ignorance of the international canon, Tan has now established himself as one of the most sought-after composers in the world. From entertaining peasants in the auditorium of the rice field, he has graduated to some of music's most prestigious venues: Lincoln Centre, Carnegie Hall, the Barbican. The same global cultural contrasts are evident in Tan Dun's remarkably diverse body of music, which Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu has described as \"violent as a burst of human blood, yet full of grace\". From Hunan comes the palette of sounds and timbres, the traditional Chinese instruments and the incantatory, contorted vocal techniques, employed to powerful effect in works such as the ritual opera Nine Songs. From urban New York we get the hip-hop rhythms, industrial guitars and samplers that propelled his hi-tech, thrash-aesthetic reinterpretation of Peony Pavilion, the classic 16th-century kunju opera. Hunan again provides the philosophical underpinnings, particularly the Taoist view of art as \"reverberations with the vital forces in nature\". Meanwhile, from the urban wellspring of New York comes the pure spirit of downtown experimentalism so evident in Soundshape and The Pink. \"What is very little heard in European or western music is the presence of sound as the voice of nature,\" commented John Cage, who was a huge influence on Tan's early US work. \"It is clear in the music of Tan Dun that sounds are central to the nature in which we live but to which we have too long not listened. In Tan Dun's music, the east and the west come together as our one home.\" Finally, from its sheer diversity, and the necessity of communicating to listeners perched on the very extremities of human civilization, comes Tan Dun's mass appeal. His Heaven Earth Mankind (Symphony 1997), commissioned for the Hong Kong handover, was made into a video for MTV. And his soundtrack for Ang Lee's Chinese-language film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival - has already shifted 200,000 copies in the east. His place on the global music stage is confirmed by the Tan Dun Festival which opens at the Barbican on September 28. Entitled Fire Crossing Water, it will feature UK premieres of his new work Water Passion as well as the score to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. However, the reaction to his work has been far from universally positive. Some Chinese composers have dismissed him as \"not serious\". The New York Times has printed scathing reviews, many of them by the music critic Bernard Holland, who has written: \"He is like the proverbial boy locked in a pastry shop, gorging indiscriminately on everything around him.\" Tan Dun responds: \"He says that I am always trying to mix wine and beer. I think he is crazy. Eventually we will all realise one day that there never were any boundaries, except those of man. All music is created by God.\" But Tan's moments of solemnity are usually immediately undermined by a mischievous streak: \"He's always been a spontaneously funny guy,\" says director Ang Lee, who has known him since the late 1980s. \"Whereas most of the other Asians in New York were generally quite shy and reserved, he could keep you entertained for hours singing some hilarious Hunan village song about how the farmer was feeling up the pigs and stroking their tits.\" He is also an excellent raconteur: \"Often you will find yourself going for lunch with Tan Dun,\" says Avril MacRory of the BBC, which co-commissioned his 2000 Today: A World Symphony for the Millennium, \"and returning at nine or 10 in the evening.\" However, Tan Dun's playful, imaginative ability to turn any situation into an entertaining anecdote has also earned him criticism. While his stories of shamanistic culture are voraciously devoured by those who have known him only in the west, many of his more cross-cultural acquaintances mutter about \"exaggeration\" and \"embellishment\". \"Tan Dun is a completely urban person,\" says Zhou Long, a fellow composer who has known him since his early days at the Beijing conservatory. \"He's not really from the village. He is from Changsha, the capital city of Hunan province. Sometimes, when you do promotion, you make stories. There is nothing wrong with that. If you are writing some biographical notes you can do that.\" There would seem to be a certain amount of evidence to support this view. One example might be the Chinese TV documentary, which was shot not in his home locality but deep in the countryside, a plane journey away. The actual village where Tan Dun spent some of his childhood has long since been swallowed up by the Changsha suburbs. Tan Dun's reaction to these assertions is both conciliatory and indignant: \"Perhaps they are right. Perhaps I am an urban person. I did spend some of of my time in the city. But anyone who says that I didn't also experience the culture of the countryside, then that is an insult to me and my background. They didn't come with me to live in a small village. They didn't come with me to be re-educated in the rice fields. How can they know how I lived my life?\" Tan Dun was born in 1957 in the central Chinese district of Hunan, the only son of Tan Xiang Qiu, a military officer in the People's Liberation Army, and Fang Qun Ying, then a doctor working in a Hunanese hospital. In the traditional manner, his first name, Dun, meaning \"shield\", comes last, though in the west he likes to be casually referred to as Tan. While his official publisher's biography - reproduced in most articles and interviews - cites the precise birthplace as the village of Si Mao, according to his father, Tan Dun was actually born in a military hospital on the outskirts of Changsha, now a rather grimy industrial regional capital of more than a million people. As was common Chinese practice for a busy working couple, his father and mother sent young Tan Dun off to live with his grandmother in the satellite village of Si Mao Chung, about 20 miles outside the city centre. Tan Dun recalls the environment in the village as \"very barbaric, very shamanistic, very mystic, very sacred, filled with traditional art forms, poetry and music... Like all the people of Hunan, the villagers were very secretive, very strange and completely devoted to their secret beliefs.\" It was this mystical environment, he says, that provided him with his first musical experiences, primarily through esoteric local rituals. \"From the local people, I started learning how to play Chinese folk instruments, bamboo flutes and the 'erhu' two-string fiddle. It was very natural. Music was simply part of life, in local kunju theatre or shamanistic ritual, mostly at weddings and funerals.\" When he returned to the city, at what he says was the age of nine, his musical education continued when a teacher presented him with an decrepit old violin: \"It only had three strings and as I had no money to replace it, I treated it like a three-stringed fiddle.\" By now, however, Mao's cultural revolution was getting into full swing and soon Tan Dun's parents were sent off to be re-educated in the countryside, his father by cleaning out the animal sheds on a farm, his mother to become what was known as a \"barefoot doctor\" among the peasants. At the age of 17, Tan Dun followed them to be re-educated in the rice fields of the Huangjin commune, about 50 miles outside Changsha. Ironically, Mao's policy - which, Deng Xiaoping later said, caused \"grave misfortunes\" for China - turned out to be a real re-education for Tan Dun, who had now fully formed in his mind the ambition of one day becoming a composer: \"In the daytime I would be planting rice in the fields for 10 hours, 12 hours,\" he recalls. \"But in the evening I would direct all farmers in a kind of rural orchestra using their cooking pots and whatever else they can use. We had no money so most of our instruments were pots, branches of trees, bits of bamboo. I began also to collect many, many folk songs.\" After two years of backbreaking work on the commune, by a macabre stroke of luck for Tan, the entire orchestra of the Changsha Peking Opera were drowned in a boating accident and officials were sent out to the communes to recruit trained musicians. He spent a year fiddling his way up through the ranks of the orchestra, then the death of Chairman Mao brought the cultural revolution to an abrupt halt. As traditional educational establishments opened once more, Tan Dun was among the 40,000 applicants for places at the Beijing conservatory, with 400 competing for just eight places on the composers' course. The entrance exam lasted a full week and covered everything from mathematics to Marxist theory to orchestration and harmony: \"I'd never been trained. I was little more than a farmer; I had never seen a piano or any of those fancy instruments. So I did everything according to my first instinct.\" On the final day came the aural: \"The examining professor asked me to play some Mozart,\" says Tan. \"And I said, 'Who is Mozart?' And he shook his head and said, 'Ohhhh my God!' And then he said, 'All right. Play some Bach.' And I said, 'What? Bach? I never heard of Bach.' And he said, 'What about Beethoven?' And I said, 'Sorry, I cannot. I am from Hunan; I don't know who Beethoven is.' So I suggested that I just improvise a little and he said, 'OK'. I took out my violin, which had only three strings on it, and I improvised for an hour. He was really shocked. Then there was a really big debate. And against every professor in the selection committee, he argued that I should be taken on the course.\" This last anecdote is a particular favourite, repeated in various forms in interviews. Sometimes he improvises on his three-stringed violin for two hours, often as long as three. On other occasions he is even more versatile: \"They asked me to sing,\" he told one publication, \"and I could sing 300 folk songs from Hunan, Szechuan, Tibet, all over. They accepted me because I was a little shaman.\" How much actual \"shamanism and magic\" really went on in the village where he grew up with his grandmother is far from clear: singer Chen Shi-Zheng, who also grew up in Changsha, contends that \"every grandmother there is a shaman\", but Tan's fellow Beijing conservatory students, some of whom grew up in neighbouring regions, cast doubt on this. Chinese shamanism is much more strongly associated with the north of China and Mongolia. His father, Tan Xiang Qiu, confirms that it was in the village that Tan Dun's love of music was ignited and divulges that his son would continually play the violin \"until the skin under his jaw was hard and callused\". But in Tan Xiang Qui's account, his son returned to the city at the age of six, not nine as Tan claims, and he also paints a picture of influences rather less traditional and shamanistic. According to Tan Xiang Qiu, far from being primitive or ignorant, his son's traditional formal musical education was quite advanced for provincial China at that time: by the age of 14 he had mastered Chinese notation and a little later travelled to Beijing to meet the com poser Hua Lu Bin, expressly for the purpose of studying western music. It is difficult to believe that this quest for western musical knowledge might not have included at least some mention of Mozart or Bach. As for the infamous audition at the Beijing conservatory, the examining professor, Li Xian, who would go on to become Tan Dun's mentor, recalls none of the events or details mentioned in the anecdote; not the questions about Beethoven or Bach, nor the three-stringed violin, nor the one- to three-hour session of traditional improvisation: \"Two hours? No, that would have been impossible,\" he says stiffly. \"Each student was allocated a specific amount of time for the tests. The maximum would have been about 20 minutes.\" While Tan Dun actually gave a rather lacklustre performance at a very straightforward audition, it was his sparkling piano trio, the evocatively entitled I Dreamt of Chairman Mao, based on traditional Hunanese folk music, that earned him his place at the conservatory. So, in September 1978, he packed his belongings - \"a bamboo pole over my shoulder,\" he says, \"one side wrapped up with my clothes, on the other side my scores\" - and left Changsha to join the composers' class. Almost immediately, Tan was marked out by the eccentricity of his musical vision: \"He always used influences in his music from his own daily life,\" remembers Li Xian. \"He would use in his music the voice of the stones, or something falling on the floor, or a cup being struck: noises normal people don't manage to use or even hear. If someone crushed a can of drink in order to put it in the trash can, he would replicate the action to hear the noise again. Then he would introduce that sound into his music.\" After a visit in 1979 to China by a Japanese troupe who used traditional Japanese instruments to make contemporary music, Tan Dun began applying the same principle to Chinese instruments and music. One of the fruits of this approach was his first symphony Li Sao, inspired by a fourth century BC melancholic poem. The piece, whose title translates as On Encountering Sorrow, featured traditional instruments and caused some controversy. His next major work, the string quartet Feng Ya Song, came second in Dresden's Weber Prize, making Tan Dun the first Chinese com poser to win an international prize since 1949. The Dresden victory had an immediate effect on Tan's career, propelling him to the forefront of the \"new wave\" of Chinese composers, but his music was denounced by the state in its renewed campaign against \"spiritual pollution\". Once the political storm had passed, Tan Dun made a request to continue his studies at Columbia, and permission was granted. So, in 1986, he took a flight from Beijing to New York and touched down in what would become his adopted homeland. \"I took the subway from the airport to Manhattan,\" he recalls, \"and I immediately understood that it wasn't at all the place I had imagined. I saw many people in the subway car, and they were all different colours. I asked myself, 'What country is this?' \" However, Tan soon tired of Columbia University. \"I immediately wanted to get away from the kind of depressing, bitter, atonal, selfish and superintellectual post-post-whatever music I was being forced to write there.\" Columbia soon reciprocally tired of him, and the professors there display a simmering animosity towards him that continues to this day: \"He was actually a very nice guy. He was a very good raconteur and I remember he was telling me stories from China that were perfectly human and very entertaining,\" says Columbia lecturer Mario Davidovsky. \"But he was at that point enormously involved in promoting himself and his career. And he was much more interested in that than anything that might have been going on at the university.\" As Columbia was only paying his fees, he had to earn money to live. \"I worked in restaurants and played my fiddle on the streets of Greenwich Village. That was my biggest classroom and in some way it was very close to my village in China, with its ritual music and its religion.\" At the first opportunity, he moved from the university dormitories into the basement of a brownstone in Chinatown, began to attend cutting-edge performance works and gradually became part of an artistic Greenwich Village set that included Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Meredith Monk. It was also about this time that Tan Dun first met John Cage and his music became, as he puts it, \"Cagealised\": \"Though I had been using incidental noises and found instruments since I was living in the village, of course I never thought of it as avant garde. But he was doing what I had done in the countryside 20 years previously.\" When Tan Dun decided that he wanted to launch himself into this world, he turned to his landlady, Mary Scherbatskoy, who had previously been a producer of dance. \"He just asked me casually one day if I'd like to produce an opera. And he showed me the score, and it was quite astonishing. But of course, being Chinese he wanted a cast of thousands. Eventually, I got him down to nine.\" The piece, Nine Songs, also based on Chinese poetry, used traditional ceramic Chinese instruments and opened with an extended sample of Tan Dun's shamanistic wailing. It was a sensation when performed at the Pace Downtown Theatre in May 1989. Tan Dun went on to produce a number of experimental performance-based and dance pieces: Soundshape in 1990 at the Guggenheim Museum, which included an entire village orchestra cast in ceramic, and The Pink in 1993, which included a cast of naked dancers playing instruments constructed entirely out of paper or cardboard. It was at the last of these, in which Tan Dun also performed as the naked conductor, that he first met his future wife, Jane Huang, then editor of a New York-based Chinese fashion magazine: \"After the show we all went to a bar . . . Immediately, he began paying me a lot of attention - I had a stomach upset and he went to the trouble of trying to get the waitress to get me some milk. Then suddenly, he said to me, 'Would you like to come to Tibet with me?' I didn't know what to say, I was absolutely shocked. I had completely misheard the question and thought he said to me, 'Would you like to come to bed with me?' But in fact we did end up going to Tibet very soon afterwards. We wanted to get married in the mountains. It was a very quick romance.\" Because of laws barring overseas Chinese from marrying in China, they had to settle for a tower-block register office in Hong Kong. They now have an two-year-old son, Ian. By this time, Tan Dun's reputation was beginning to cross over into the mainstream. An association with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra was the catalyst for the Orchestral Theatre series, four instalments of experimental gimmickry (part II saw the audience join in with trance-like chanting) multimedia (part III was set against a newsreel ranging from the Beatles to Mao's revolution) and a full orchestral score. The Edinburgh Festival commissioned Tan Dun's phenomenal Marco Polo, which featured a \"postmodern\" libretto by New York Times music critic Paul Griffith in which Marco and Polo appear as two characters/singers representing the yin/yang, east/west boundaries of modern culture. \"I don't really have any great interest in the east and the west as a dialogue,\" Tan Dun says. \"What I am interested in is trying to find a single language and distinctive style that is made up of many, many cultures and that can reach from many different diverse cultures.\" It is ironic that, in pursuit of this goal, he feels he needs to play up the primitive aspects of his background to such a degree, though in fact, the emphasis of his biographical details probably says more about the need for modern composers to distinguish themselves as much in their press packs as in their work. However, Tan Dun will ultimately be judged not on his life story but on his music, and in this area he still has a great deal to offer: \"One of the things I like about pop music is its accessibility and power. There, music just becomes the art of dancing together, performing together. And I think that if you can find that same international communicable quality, and somehow combine it with a very distinct personality and a very local and a very, very inward point of view, then you can smash the world.\" Life at a glance Born: August 8 1957, Changsha, Hunan, China.

It is hard to believe now that there was a period when it was assumed that an attacker through on goal could be brought down from behind, a yard outside the penalty area, with the offender receiving no more punishment than a free-kick because \"there was nothing else he could have done\". Even the minor time-wasting habits, such as kicking the ball out of play or arguing at free-kicks, are becoming less available. No sooner has a ball been whacked into the crowd than another is immediately to hand. And, slowly but surely, referees are applying the new rule which advances a free-kick 10 yards if there is dissent. Anything which produces a greater likelihood of goals being scored and makes it harder for teams to kill matches off is to be applauded. But too many easy goals cheapen the game and what is needed now is a new breed of defenders capable of taking all the recent changes to their trade on board and still making it difficult for opposing forwards to find a way through. George Graham, while welcoming his Tottenham team's recovery to beat Everton this week, was right to point out that overall the present defending in the Premiership is poor. Outstanding sides are invariably based on outstanding defences - witness the present French team - but, when Chelsea cannot hold a lead even with Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf in their back four there is clearly some way to go. In the meantime stout females with strong vocal chords have never had it so good.",

The hearings are due to resume on October 2. The commission's lead advocate, Shamila Batohi, has been named as the new head of the KwaZulu-Natal branch of the elite Scorpions police unit, but will complete her duties at the King Commission before moving across in November.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Mike Selvey</strong> talks to John Edrich, ex- of Surrey and England, and considers England's spin dillemma </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>John Edrich turned up in the back of the Oval press box last week. He is 63 now but looks 20 years younger, so that you could imagine him still strapping on the pads and pottering out to take on the best. He has leukaemia, too,though you would not suspect that either, so brimful of health did he look. He says he feels fine. </p> <p>So we chattered away for a while, about England and Surrey and the year he suddenly decided to hit sixes (49, he thinks) because there was a cash prize on offer. Then, inevitably for us, we got round to West Indies, Old Trafford and 1976. For me this represented the start of a brief Test career; for him it was the end of a long and distinguished one that began, with nice symmetry, 13 years previously on the same ground against the same opponents. </p> <p>For 80 minutes on the evening of the third day of his final game he and Brian Close, protected by neither helmets nor umpires, were subjected to as cynical a barrage of brutal short-pitched bowling from Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Wayne Daniel as can have been delivered in the history of the game, and survived battered, bruised but in good spirits. </p> <p>Anyway, for all the trauma, no chances were offered until, with the close in sight and immediately after a particularly nasty over from Holding had left Close with broken ribs and the bowler a belated warning for intimidation, Clive Lloyd brought on Albert Padmore to bowl to Edrich. </p> <p>Albert who? Padmore was an off-spinner from Barbados and his first ball was turned to the onside by Edrich, who was sitting back contemplating the next delivery when he realised that Close, who had faced Holding for five successive overs at the other end, had sneaked up on him, noise masked by his Green Flash plimsolls. After all the flak Edrich was all but run out because Close wanted to get at the off-spinner. </p> <p>But what, Edrich and I pondered the other day, was Padmore doing playing. Only three fast bowlers? Well, they had yet to learn the value of four. It did not take long, however: for the last two Tests that summer the three were augmented by Vanburn Holder, and the die was cast. Only 12 spinners have played for West Indies since, although Carl Hooper, the most successful, was a batsman, and Roger Harper, an allrounder and the next best, mostly supported four seamers. </p> <p>And on the occasion when a spinner actually replaced one of the fast-bowling giants it has rankled. \"Why play a spinner for the sake of it if a paceman can do the job better?\" says Holding, who conceded that the appearance of Mahendra Nagamootoo at the Oval was precisely because for the first time in 25 years the back-up pacemen were not up to it. </p> <p>It serves to highlight a dilemma that will confront England in the coming winter when they tour Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Already the war of words is starting with Wasim Akram saying England have no chance because they do not know the conditions and cannot play spin. Saqlain Mushtaq will destroy them, he says, and the Pakistan board should prepare pitches to accommodate him. </p> <p>England, aware that this might be a possibility, have searched desperately for a couple of spinners to add to their touring party and have come up with Ashley Giles and Ian Salisbury, although the prospect of facing either is not about to send Saeed Anwar and Inzamam-ul-Haq into a cold sweat. </p> <p>Whenever England have played a spinner, be it Phil Tufnell, Robert Croft (no more letters, please, the waste bin is overflowing), Giles, Salisbury or Chris Schofield, the overwhelming feeling after the match has been that a good seamer could have done the job as well if not better. </p> <p>So the question will need to be addressed, even if the pitches produced in Pakistan are made for the benefit of Saqlain - and it is by no means certain they would go over the top in any case, given Saqlain's skill on good pitches plus the presence of Wasim, Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar and Abdur Razzaq - is it in England's interest to break up either the bowling attack or the balance of the side that has proved so successful this season? </p> <p>So, which bowler would you omit to make way for Giles or Salisbury? Darren Gough? Andy Caddick? Dominic Cork then? Well, not Craig White, whose reverse swing could make him a major factor. </p> <p>To my mind, even now, the conditions in Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi would have to be alien in the extreme even to contemplate fragmenting the current unit. </p> <p>So get Michael Vaughan's off spin up to speed, and that of Graeme Hick as well, and let's have no more nonsense about the rest until our own Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralitharan or Saqlain emerges.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Edrich turned up in the back of the Oval press box last week. He is 63 now but looks 20 years younger, so that you could imagine him still strapping on the pads and pottering out to take on the best. He has leukaemia, too,though you would not suspect that either, so brimful of health did he look. He says he feels fine. So we chattered away for a while, about England and Surrey and the year he suddenly decided to hit sixes (49, he thinks) because there was a cash prize on offer. Then, inevitably for us, we got round to West Indies, Old Trafford and 1976. For me this represented the start of a brief Test career; for him it was the end of a long and distinguished one that began, with nice symmetry, 13 years previously on the same ground against the same opponents. For 80 minutes on the evening of the third day of his final game he and Brian Close, protected by neither helmets nor umpires, were subjected to as cynical a barrage of brutal short-pitched bowling from Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and Wayne Daniel as can have been delivered in the history of the game, and survived battered, bruised but in good spirits. Anyway, for all the trauma, no chances were offered until, with the close in sight and immediately after a particularly nasty over from Holding had left Close with broken ribs and the bowler a belated warning for intimidation, Clive Lloyd brought on Albert Padmore to bowl to Edrich. Albert who? Padmore was an off-spinner from Barbados and his first ball was turned to the onside by Edrich, who was sitting back contemplating the next delivery when he realised that Close, who had faced Holding for five successive overs at the other end, had sneaked up on him, noise masked by his Green Flash plimsolls. After all the flak Edrich was all but run out because Close wanted to get at the off-spinner. But what, Edrich and I pondered the other day, was Padmore doing playing. Only three fast bowlers? Well, they had yet to learn the value of four. It did not take long, however: for the last two Tests that summer the three were augmented by Vanburn Holder, and the die was cast. Only 12 spinners have played for West Indies since, although Carl Hooper, the most successful, was a batsman, and Roger Harper, an allrounder and the next best, mostly supported four seamers. And on the occasion when a spinner actually replaced one of the fast-bowling giants it has rankled. \"Why play a spinner for the sake of it if a paceman can do the job better?\" says Holding, who conceded that the appearance of Mahendra Nagamootoo at the Oval was precisely because for the first time in 25 years the back-up pacemen were not up to it. It serves to highlight a dilemma that will confront England in the coming winter when they tour Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Already the war of words is starting with Wasim Akram saying England have no chance because they do not know the conditions and cannot play spin. Saqlain Mushtaq will destroy them, he says, and the Pakistan board should prepare pitches to accommodate him. England, aware that this might be a possibility, have searched desperately for a couple of spinners to add to their touring party and have come up with Ashley Giles and Ian Salisbury, although the prospect of facing either is not about to send Saeed Anwar and Inzamam-ul-Haq into a cold sweat. Whenever England have played a spinner, be it Phil Tufnell, Robert Croft (no more letters, please, the waste bin is overflowing), Giles, Salisbury or Chris Schofield, the overwhelming feeling after the match has been that a good seamer could have done the job as well if not better. So the question will need to be addressed, even if the pitches produced in Pakistan are made for the benefit of Saqlain - and it is by no means certain they would go over the top in any case, given Saqlain's skill on good pitches plus the presence of Wasim, Waqar Younis, Shoaib Akhtar and Abdur Razzaq - is it in England's interest to break up either the bowling attack or the balance of the side that has proved so successful this season? So, which bowler would you omit to make way for Giles or Salisbury? Darren Gough? Andy Caddick? Dominic Cork then? Well, not Craig White, whose reverse swing could make him a major factor. To my mind, even now, the conditions in Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi would have to be alien in the extreme even to contemplate fragmenting the current unit. So get Michael Vaughan's off spin up to speed, and that of Graeme Hick as well, and let's have no more nonsense about the rest until our own Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralitharan or Saqlain emerges.",

The former England manager celebrates a year in charge at St James' Park this afternoon, entering his 50th game as Newcastle manager in search of his 25th win. It is hard to believe he inherited a side at the foot of the Premiership, reeling from a derby defeat by Sunderland that marked the lowest point of Ruud Gullit's disastrous year in charge. </p> <p>Now, having motored into mid-table and to an FA Cup semi-final last season, the Magpies lead the Premiership for the first time since November 23 1996. Indeed, there is a perfect symmetry about this afternoon's visit of Chelsea. Robson's first match in charge after replacing Gullit as manager was at Stamford Bridge; the Londoners won 1-0, Newcastle stayed joint bottom with a solitary point, but the first seeds of success had been sown. </p> <p>A week later Sheffield Wednesday were beaten 8-0; a year on, the Toon is buzzing again. \"We've made great strides,\" said Robson. \"In footballing terms it's been meteoric. The response from the players since I've been here has been wonderful, quite magnificent. It's all down to them.\" </p> <p>The club's supporters disagree. \"The man's a saint,\" said Gary Mowlem, a lifelong Newcastle fan and season ticket holder. \"If I'd been out of the country for four years and come back to hear that we'd had Kenny Dalglish and Ruud Gullit in charge, I'd be asking 'How many trophies have we won?' But they were disastrous. </p> <p>\"In hindsight, the board should have taken the plunge and appointed Bobby four years ago. Just imagine what he would have achieved with the \u00a360m spent by Dalglish and Gullit; we'd be champions by now. Instead we wasted those years and Bobby's had to work with no resources whatsoever.\" </p> <p>\"When Robson was first mentioned as a possible manager I didn't really want him here,\" admitted Mark Jensen, the editor of the Newcastle fanzine The Mag, to incredulous gasps at the publication's office. \"There were two things to consider: You could say he was too old, but then again he had so much experience. </p> <p>\"I suppose in some ways it was similar to when Keegan came in. At that time he was the only man who could do the job, and that's probably what happened with Bobby as well. As a seasoned Newcastle fan I was just looking on the dark side. But I'm happy to hold my hands up now and say I was wrong.\" </p> <p>Such sentiments are shared by the players Robson has transformed from whipping boys to table-toppers. \"The gaffer saved my Newcastle career,\" says the midfielder Rob Lee, a veteran of the Kevin Keegan era at St James' Park who had fallen so far in Gullit's estimation as to be denied even a squad number. \"If Gullit had been at the club for another month or so he would have wrecked a few Newcastle careers, not just mine. I would have left and I don't think Alan Shearer would have been too far behind. </p> <p>\"It's strange, but if we hadn't lost the derby against Sunderland we would never have had Bobby Robson. It was sad that it had to be that way, but I can't complain now. I'd reached the stage where it had all become too much for me. It was the most awful time of my life. I have never been treated like that by anybody. I didn't deserve it and it was all coming to a head. Now, with Bobby, everything has changed.\" </p> <p>With relatively little money to spend, Robson's principal success has been to galvanise a squad who had lost all self-belief under Gullit. Of the side that took the Magpies to the summit on Wednesday by beating Coventry 2-0, only two were bought by Robson, but the infectious enthusiasm of the manager transposed itself into the team's performance. </p> <p>\"He may be 67 but you watch him out on the training pitch, running around with the players, and it goes to show that if you're good enough you're young enough,\" added Jensen. </p> <p>\"Bobby's done it all. He'd managed one of the biggest clubs in the world at Barcelona and had taken England to a World Cup semi-final. He was also a Geordie, which helped, although that was no guarantee of success; Jack Charlton had black and white blood running through his veins and couldn't do it up here.\" </p> <p>But Robson could. \"We've worked hard to improve every segment of the team,\" he said. \"Our work ethic has been 100%, our defence looks stronger now than it has done in months and we have strengthened the squad despite letting a number of players go in the summer. </p> <p>\"We're not going to win the championship - to leap from 11th in the table to winning the Premiership is too big a jump to make in one year - but we can improve on last season. We will be chasing the dreaded four of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool.\" </p> <p>His immediate task is to try to avoid the fate of most recipients of the monthly managers' award - defeat even before the champagne has gone flat - against one of that quartet. Chelsea beat Newcastle three times last season - \"I don't think any team's done that to me in my life before\" - and Robson has spent the week keeping his players' feet firmly on the ground. </p> <p>\"Everyone's all excited about being top of the league, but it's September, not May.

Woolwich's 1.15m shareholders must now work their way through the contents of the very large envelope from Barclays which has been thumping on to doormats this week. </p> <p>And the takeover literature for the \u00a35.6bn uncontested cash and shares offer could take over even more shelf space if investors ask for the optional 200 page plus A4 Barclays \"listing particulars\". </p> <p>Despite the weight, Woolwich holders will find no advice on whether to swap their stock for Barclays shares or for cash. No one from either side will tell them if Barclays shares are a good bet or not. </p> <p>And Woolwich's retreating army will have to work their way through to page 199 in one book and page 24 in another before they find any details of tax considerations. Despite the \"This document is important and requires your immediate attention\" line on each item, few are likely to get beyond the glossy 12-page A5 questions and answers booklet where they will not find anything at all about potential tax liabilities. </p> <p>Because windfall shares were free, their entire value less a small inflation adjustment for the period up to March 1998 could be liable for capital gains tax (CGT) unless the shares were held in a personal equity plan. </p> <p>This is unlikely to affect anyone with a typical holding. But it could hit those with larger stakes or investors who have clocked up capital gains elsewhere. The annual \"exemption\" is \u00a37,200 - after that investors could pay up to 40p in the pound on their gains. </p> <p>Those with a possible tax bill will need to opt for as many Barclays shares as possible rather than take cash. Rolling over one share into another as part of a takeover does not incur a tax bill. Those holding Woolwich in a Pep are also likely to go for the shares unless they have another stock in mind - Pep rules ban long-term cash holdings. </p> <p>The \"Q &amp; A\" booklet was included on the insistence of the Woolwich team in the teeth of opposition from Barclays lawyers who did not believe in special help for small shareholders. But while it is mute on tax problems, or on whether to take the cash or the shares, it does explain the choice mechanism. </p> <p>Shareholders are being offered \u00a31.64 plus 0.1175 Barclays share for each Woolwich share. No one can be sent part of a share -cheques will compensate for fractions. </p> <p>If holders do nothing they will receive Barclays' set formula when the deal is finalised - and there is no chance it will not go through. Big investors are backing this deal so even a major small shareholder vote for continuing Woolwich independence will be futile. </p> <p>Investors can opt for all shares either for tax reasons or because they think Barclays is a good bet (see above). Alternatively they can go for cash and no shares - this choice could be popular with investors who are fed up with the stock market. </p> <p>But there are no guarantees that investor choice will be honoured. Barclays has structured the deal so that it knows exactly what Woolwich will cost - it intends to issue 179m new shares and pay out around \u00a32.7m in cash no matter how shareholders use the mix'n'match option. </p> <p>If too many go for cash, it will scale down their requests and increase the shares they receive - or vice versa. All shareholders will be treated equally in this exercise, however. And as it is unlikely that investors will select in the exact proportions of the Barclays offer, many will be disappointed. </p> <p>Investors have until October 20 to make their choice. Much will depend on the Barclays share price on that date - if it is higher than \u00a316.44, big investors will go for shares or if it is lower, the institutions may opt for cash. </p> <p>Cheques and share certificates will be sent by November 7. </p> <p><strong>Brokers banking on Barclays </strong></p> <p>Opting for Barclays shares at the fixed \u00a316.44 offer price looks like a sure fire winner - the shares are currently trading over \u00a317 - still shy of the 2000 high at \u00a318.28, though substantially above this year's \u00a313.44 low point. </p> <p>But beyond the hopes of making a quick turn, the shares are rated a longer term purchase in the City. Out of 17 brokers giving an opinion on Hemscott.net, 12 are backing Barclays as a buy with the others suggesting that investors should hold. There are no negatives. </p> <p>Big institutional broker Merrill Lynch is a Barclays fan. Its analysts believe Woolwich \"is the best placed strategically of the mortgage banks\". It likes Woolwich's Open Plan bank product and the way Barclays can move its mortgage business to the lower cost Woolwich. </p> <p>Brokers are cheered by Woolwich boss John Stewart's sticking at his post. He is willing to swap his - admittedly virtually worthless - options for those in Barclays. </p> <p>They see Barclays with an \"each way bet on financial services\" - it wins if mortgage margins crumble and wins if internet style banks take off thanks to Open Plan.</p>",

Shareholders are being offered \u00a31.64 plus 0.1175 Barclays share for each Woolwich share. No one can be sent part of a share -cheques will compensate for fractions. If holders do nothing they will receive Barclays' set formula when the deal is finalised - and there is no chance it will not go through. Big investors are backing this deal so even a major small shareholder vote for continuing Woolwich independence will be futile. Investors can opt for all shares either for tax reasons or because they think Barclays is a good bet (see above). Alternatively they can go for cash and no shares - this choice could be popular with investors who are fed up with the stock market. But there are no guarantees that investor choice will be honoured. Barclays has structured the deal so that it knows exactly what Woolwich will cost - it intends to issue 179m new shares and pay out around \u00a32.7m in cash no matter how shareholders use the mix'n'match option. If too many go for cash, it will scale down their requests and increase the shares they receive - or vice versa. All shareholders will be treated equally in this exercise, however. And as it is unlikely that investors will select in the exact proportions of the Barclays offer, many will be disappointed. Investors have until October 20 to make their choice. Much will depend on the Barclays share price on that date - if it is higher than \u00a316.44, big investors will go for shares or if it is lower, the institutions may opt for cash. Cheques and share certificates will be sent by November 7. Brokers banking on Barclays Opting for Barclays shares at the fixed \u00a316.44 offer price looks like a sure fire winner - the shares are currently trading over \u00a317 - still shy of the 2000 high at \u00a318.28, though substantially above this year's \u00a313.44 low point. But beyond the hopes of making a quick turn, the shares are rated a longer term purchase in the City. Out of 17 brokers giving an opinion on Hemscott.net, 12 are backing Barclays as a buy with the others suggesting that investors should hold. There are no negatives. Big institutional broker Merrill Lynch is a Barclays fan. Its analysts believe Woolwich \"is the best placed strategically of the mortgage banks\". It likes Woolwich's Open Plan bank product and the way Barclays can move its mortgage business to the lower cost Woolwich. Brokers are cheered by Woolwich boss John Stewart's sticking at his post. He is willing to swap his - admittedly virtually worthless - options for those in Barclays. They see Barclays with an \"each way bet on financial services\" - it wins if mortgage margins crumble and wins if internet style banks take off thanks to Open Plan.",

      "body": "<p> <br><a href=\"http://www.axa.com/nav/index_ss_dhtml_98.asp\">Axa</a>'s plans to pay out its \u00a31.7bn \"orphan estate\" received a stunning blow yesterday when the Consumers' Association said it is to take court action to block what it describes as a \"shoddy deal\" for policyholders. </p> <p>The CA has taken independent actuarial advice which it says shows that Axa's shareholders are grabbing far too large a share of the surplus cash. It now wants policyholders to contact the CA so it can mount a case against Axa at the November 20 High Court hearing at which Axa needs to gain approval for the plan to go ahead. </p> <p>Ashley Holmes, the CA's head of legal affairs, says: \"Three things are emerging. Firstly, it is becoming clear that shareholders are benefiting far more from this distribution than policyholders. Secondly, the position has been spun by Axa to make it appear that shareholders are not getting such a large share, and thirdly, the documents sent to policyholders are almost completely incomprehensible.\" </p> <p>The CA asked several actuaries, including KPMG, to go through the Axa proposals with a fine toothcomb. \"Recommendations from the Treasury have previously stated that policyholders are generally entitled to at least 90% of these funds and shareholders should receive no more than 10%. But our evidence shows that the deal will deliver just 31% to policyholders,\" it says. </p> <p>On that basis, policyholders are only receiving \u00a3527m, or \u00a31bn less than they should be earning on a 90/10 distribution. In cash terms, it suggests that the \u00a3400 average windfall for policyholders quoted by Axa should instead be just over \u00a31,000. </p> <p>The CA's research and planned court action will come as a shock to the 660,000 policyholders who received mailings from Axa last week. The packs contained an immensely complex 110-page policyholder circular, accompanied by a voting form, which Axa wants returned by October 16. Axa's plan needs the approval of 35% of policyholders, with payouts expected to be made in February 2001. </p> <p>But the CA action may halt the plan, even if it gains the 35% approval needed from policyholders. This is because the High Court has the power to block the plan if it believes it is against the interests of with-profits policyholders. </p> <p>Policyholders are now left in a difficult position. Should they vote for the cash or wait and see what happens in the High Court? They may vote yes, but find the plan blocked. Or they may vote no (or not return the voting form) in which case two scenarios could arise. The High Court may reject the plan after the CA's representations, in which case Axa will have to go back to the drawing board and produce a better alternative. But if the High Court accepts the plan, the \"no\" policyholders will have lost their right to a windfall payout. They will not lose their rights over the orphan estate, but will not receive the cash bonus; instead they will have to wait for a special bonus at an unspecified time in the future. </p> <p>\"It is a very tough decision for people to make,\" admits the CA's Mr Holmes. \"Axa has dressed this process up as 'choice' - but, in reality, they are not giving people choice. We can't take decisions for individual policyholders. What we are saying is that we have new evidence that the deal is a poor one, and that if people agree with us and are unhappy about the deal, they should contact us. We want as many people as possible to do so.\" </p> <p>Mr Holmes says policyholders should write to CA at Dept LM at PO Box 44, Hertford X, SG14 1SH, or by email to <a href=\"mailto:orphan@which.net\">orphan@which.net</a>. The CA has also prepared a briefing on the Axa deal, summarising advice from its actuaries, obtainable by ringing 020 7770 7264/7061. </p> <p>One Axa policyholder who shares the CA's concerns is Jobs &amp; Money reader Rowland Clayton of Great Malvern in Worcestershire. He wrote to us this week with his objections to the deal. He is also writing to the High Court detailing why it should reject the proposals which he says give policyholders a \"Hobson's choice.\" </p> <p>He says: \"The policyholders own 90% of the inherited estate. It is stated, but not con firmed by [Axa's] independent actuary that the share- holders' benefit will be \u00a3100-\u00a3200m, compared with the benefit to policyholders of \u00a3300m. </p> <p>\"If these figures are correct, much less than 90% is going to policyholders. The implication is that the proposals are designed to benefit the shareholders rather than the policyholders. This does not seem equitable. I suggest the High Court should refuse to sanction these proposals.\" </p> <p>Axa is standing by its proposals. Spokesman Stuart Prosser says: \"We spent a lot of time working on these proposals and believe it is a fair offer for policyholders. But it's not only us who believe this. </p> <p>\"We have the approval of an independent actuary and the Financial Services Authority feels the same way. Both the FSA and the independent actuary are acting on behalf of policyholders, not shareholders.\" </p> <p>The CA's principal concerns about the deal centre around the \u00a3836m that Axa wants to put aside for tax and lock-in liabilities. \"The reality is that careful tax planning could result in a considerable amount of this money going to shareholders. Furthermore, the lock-in deduction appears to be based on unduly stringent critieria.\" </p> <p>It also disputes that the FSA has in reality approved the Axa proposals. \"If you read the FSA document closely, it is not approval; what it says is that that it has no reason why it should stop Axa from going forward for a vote,\" says the CA's Mr Holmes. </p> <p>One thorny issue remains for the CA, though. Who will pay for the court action? CA is hoping that, in the style of the recent Equitable Life court case, Axa will fund the court challenge so it can establish that its deal is fair. Or not.</p>",

On a long flight I'm such a word junkie that I end up reading all that small print on the back of the ticket about not carrying bombs on planes if you can avoid it (it's the Warsaw Convention, check it out next time.) </p> <p>And if I'm in the bath too long, it's only a matter of time before I start reading the labels on the back of the shampoo and bubble bath. And apart from learning the Finnish for \"hair care\" (it seems to be a country where they've mistaken a stutter for a language), you'll soon discover that almost everything that's in a plastic container in a bathroom is made of the same ingredients.</p> <p>They might claim to be unique, they might be revolutionary, they might be for entirely different markets and purposes, but you can bet your backside that, apart from the packaging, they're all more or less the same stuff. Take a look at your shampoo, shaving foam, bath lotion, bubble bath, even your minty-blue cool-gel toothpaste and among the main ingredients will be aqua (water), laureth sodium sulfate (stuff that foams up) and a whole list of other near-identical contents.</p> <p>This same sense of more or less the same products dressed up in different boxes may have occurred to the hundreds of thousands of students who, in the next couple of weeks, will be choosing their first bank account and might be struggling to find the differences.</p> <p>For the banks, this is a once-a-year chance to recruit customers who could stay with them for life. And by promising a few introductory offers now, the banks hope to acquire account holders who, in a few years, will be high-earning graduates.</p> <p>This is big business, as the current total for students in higher education has reached more than 1.75 million. So what are students being offered to lure them into a lifetime relationship?</p> <p>If you cut away the slightly embarrassing attempts to be hip in the packaging, the high street banks are almost all promising the same three things: a basic current account, an interest-free overdraft and a freebie (along the lines of a CD voucher). And considering the long-term benefit to the banks, I'm always surprised how modest these efforts are.

      "bodyText": "I think I'm addicted to reading. On a long flight I'm such a word junkie that I end up reading all that small print on the back of the ticket about not carrying bombs on planes if you can avoid it (it's the Warsaw Convention, check it out next time.) And if I'm in the bath too long, it's only a matter of time before I start reading the labels on the back of the shampoo and bubble bath. And apart from learning the Finnish for \"hair care\" (it seems to be a country where they've mistaken a stutter for a language), you'll soon discover that almost everything that's in a plastic container in a bathroom is made of the same ingredients. They might claim to be unique, they might be revolutionary, they might be for entirely different markets and purposes, but you can bet your backside that, apart from the packaging, they're all more or less the same stuff. Take a look at your shampoo, shaving foam, bath lotion, bubble bath, even your minty-blue cool-gel toothpaste and among the main ingredients will be aqua (water), laureth sodium sulfate (stuff that foams up) and a whole list of other near-identical contents. This same sense of more or less the same products dressed up in different boxes may have occurred to the hundreds of thousands of students who, in the next couple of weeks, will be choosing their first bank account and might be struggling to find the differences. For the banks, this is a once-a-year chance to recruit customers who could stay with them for life. And by promising a few introductory offers now, the banks hope to acquire account holders who, in a few years, will be high-earning graduates. This is big business, as the current total for students in higher education has reached more than 1.75 million. So what are students being offered to lure them into a lifetime relationship? If you cut away the slightly embarrassing attempts to be hip in the packaging, the high street banks are almost all promising the same three things: a basic current account, an interest-free overdraft and a freebie (along the lines of a CD voucher). And considering the long-term benefit to the banks, I'm always surprised how modest these efforts are. Given that it's difficult to get young people excited about a bank account, you'd think that the free gifts could have been slightly more adventurous. For instance, Barclays offers \u00a340 worth of vouchers, NatWest promises a CD player or \u00a335 cash and HSBC will slip you \u00a350 or a young person's railcard, the level of birthday present teenagers might expect from a generous granny rather than a global financial organisation. It might not be particularly ethical, but if the banks got serious about bribing and offered free tickets to New York they could sign up a whole generation of students for the price of a few charter flights. So if the freebies aren't going to turn many heads, the interest-free overdraft limits could be the biggest attraction. These range between \u00a3500 and \u00a32,000, often with the higher limits only available to students after a couple of years.

Two years later he took early retirement, cashed in much of the fund and bought an annuity. In 1995 he asked ScotEq how much he would be entitled to on his 65th birthday. He reminded ScotEq that he had already taken money from the fund. But he was told the fund was worth \u00a3201,000. Surprised it was so high he sought confirmation and was assured the figure was correct. </p> <p>ScotEq did not realise its mistake for another 16 months: it then sought back the \u00a3172,500 extra Mr Derby had been paid. But Mr Derby had disposed of the money. He used \u00a3150,000 to buy another pension from the Norwich Union; \u00a342,000 to pay off his mortgage, and the remaining \u00a39,000 he had simply spent. </p> <p>The judge ruled the issue was whether Mr Derby had changed his position in reliance on the overpayment. He was guided by a 1991 House of Lords' decision arising from Mr Cass, a partner in solicitors Lipkin Gorman, gambling around \u00a3223,000 from the client account at the Playboy casino. When the theft was discovered the partners tried to recover the money from the club. It was held they were entitled to \u00a3154,000. </p> <p>The club had received stolen money and were not entitled to it. However, it had also paid out money when Mr Cass won. Legally it had not been obliged to pay this, as gambling contracts are unenforceable, and the partners argued it should not be entitled to deduct this from the sums it had to pay back to them. </p> <p>The Lords considered that the casino had altered its position by making these payments to Mr Cass, which were only made in the belief that he was entitled to gamble. The judge thought Mr Derby had not acted to his detriment in reliance on the over-payment. He claimed that he would have worked harder and earned more in the 16-month period had he not had the \u00a3201,000 but the judge did not believe his age and health would have let him do so. </p> <p>The only \"detriment\" Mr Derby had suffered was spending the \u00a39,000, which he would not have done had he not been misled about his financial position. As far as the mortgage was concerned he may only have repaid because of ScotEq's overpayment, but he was no worse off because of that or he would still have been liable for it. </p> <p>And his new pension could be \"unwound\" to pay back ScotEq. Spending that \u00a39,000 was analogous to the club paying Mr Cass. He had altered his position in the belief he was entitled to it, but that was the only sum he could keep. So anyone who receives overpayments from financial institutions will have more chance of keeping the extra if they fritter it away rather than invest it. Mr Derby's entitlement to keep the sum was based on his belief that he was entitled to it.

The yield from the shares goes to the holders of \"fixed-rate annuity shares\". They are a fiendishly complicated piece of financial engineering, but as they are all held by parent company Friends Provident and not traded, investors do not need to understand them. These shares are used to boost the capital to make up for the lack of income.

Alternatively, you can sell in the market.\" </p> <p>Charges are a very low 0.55% a year with no entry or exit costs. Launch investors do not pay stamp duty. </p> <p>The one thing that can go wrong is that the underlying investments fail to grow. Those who continue to take their full income will find their investment shrinks. </p> <p>It will face competition from the new LeggMason Investors American Assets fund which promises \"outstanding growth potential and 8.25% income\" although neither is guaranteed. </p> <p>This investment trust will concentrate on US stocks with around half in blue chips listed in New York, around 15% in a portfolio of dollar denominated bonds with the balance in a portfolio of UK split level investment trusts.

It allows visitors with poor vision to enlarge text on screen or change colours. </p> <p>Help the Aged director general Michael Lake says: \"The sheer power of the internet to inform and empower older people has the potential to change the way everyone lives their lives. For too long retired people have been excluded from the routes to political and social influence. This will now change as the silver surfers access services, consumer goods and government from the comfort of their own homes.\" </p> <p>So where do novice silver surfers start? If you can't afford your own computer, many public libraries and local colleges offer cheap access to PCs and hundreds of day centres are also connecting up to give thousands of low-income pensioners ready access to internet sites. </p> <p>There is a growing wealth of websites aimed at those in their middle to older years. Here is a taster of some worth visiting. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.helptheaged.org.uk\">http://www.helptheaged.org.uk</a></strong></p> <p> This user-friendly site lets you access the charity's range of advice leaflets on subjects including pensions, residential care and welfare support as well as background briefings on the older population and government policy. You can also get information on events and campaigns, make donations online and register to receive emailed monthly policy update bulletins. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.ageconcern.org.uk\">http://www.ageconcern.org.uk</a></strong></p> <p> This site comes with a useful guided tour with short cuts to its main sections including news, Age Concern publications, links to other useful websites and a huge range of factsheets on a range of topics for older people which you can read on screen or print. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbb.org.uk\">http://www.bbb.org.uk</a></strong></p> <p> Baby Boomer Bistro is \"an internet chat cafe designed for the over-50s\" set up by Age Concern's sister organisation Age Resource. After registering by choosing a chat name and a password, you to join in online discussions about day-to-day events and topics by visiting different \"rooms\", some with specific themes and some designed for private chats. The rooms are regularly monitored to ensure they are not being abused. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.arp.org.uk\">http://www.arp.org.uk</a> </strong></p> <p> The website for the Association of Retired and Persons over 50, Britain's largest campaigning organisation for people over 50 with 100,000-plus members. Lots of interesting and useful information on a wide range of topics including health, study, retirement, employment, property, caring, travel and finance, though the association is an introducer for financial products only from CGU Financial Services. Allows you to email your views on various topics. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.vavo.com\">http://www.vavo.com</a></strong></p> <p> Launched a year ago and now with over 40,000 registered members, this is described as the market leading \"portal\" or \"online community\" for people aged 45 and over where the site contents are largely dictated by what members want. </p> <p>It offers access to a several channels including news, on-line shopping, health, travel, finance and dating, where you can read features and ask questions of experts. </p> <p>You can also access more than 100 topic areas set up and run by members, complete with chat rooms, on anything from hobbies and leisure pursuits to campaigning issues such as lobbying for better pensions and getting older people back to work. </p> <p>So popular is the site that more than 200 members are meeting face-to-face for a weekend in a hotel later this month to celebrate vavo.com's first birthday. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.seniority.co.uk\">http://www.seniority.co.uk</a></strong></p> <p> Described as an, \"informative, fun and interactive online community created by and for people aged 50(ish!)\", this is a similar, but smaller, idea to vavo.com, though perhaps a bit more tricky to use. </p> <p> <strong><a href=\"http://www.idf50.co.uk\">http://www.idf50.co.uk</a></strong></p> <p> \"I don't feel 50\" is a lively site set up in 1998 as \"the first UK site for over 50s\" by Graham Andrews, who felt that existing over-50s organisations tended to be a bit, \"po-faced and institutional\". The aim of the site is to give' \"practical, unbiased help to people aged 50-plus\" and it gives lots of information on a range of serious subjects from financing your retirement to prostate cancer as well as lighter topics such as all-time favourite music albums.

Now it is time for the over-50s to fight back and claim their rightful status in cyberspace.\" It offers chat rooms and a small mix of both serious and fun topics including a section on alien life and a good humour section.

      "bodyText": "An increasing number of websites are being aimed at \"silver surfers\", the fast-growing band of older people who are discovering the power of the internet. \"It's very easy to write older people off when it comes to new technology,\" says a spokesperson for Age Concern, the UK's largest charitable operation, which celebrates its 60th birthday this week. \"But the reality is that one in four people aged 50 plus uses a computer in their spare time, some 2.2m older people already use the internet and even more email their friends and family.\" Recognising the internet as a valuable information and communication tool for older people, particularly the isolated, Age Concern, in partnership with Microsoft, is piloting Mobile IT Training Sessions (MITS) around the UK to introduce the new technology to older people. This week has also seen the launch Help the aged's website, which aims to provide 10.8m older people, their relatives and carers with information on all aspects relating to the older population. It allows visitors with poor vision to enlarge text on screen or change colours. Help the Aged director general Michael Lake says: \"The sheer power of the internet to inform and empower older people has the potential to change the way everyone lives their lives. For too long retired people have been excluded from the routes to political and social influence. This will now change as the silver surfers access services, consumer goods and government from the comfort of their own homes.\" So where do novice silver surfers start? If you can't afford your own computer, many public libraries and local colleges offer cheap access to PCs and hundreds of day centres are also connecting up to give thousands of low-income pensioners ready access to internet sites. There is a growing wealth of websites aimed at those in their middle to older years. Here is a taster of some worth visiting. http://www.helptheaged.org.uk This user-friendly site lets you access the charity's range of advice leaflets on subjects including pensions, residential care and welfare support as well as background briefings on the older population and government policy. You can also get information on events and campaigns, make donations online and register to receive emailed monthly policy update bulletins. http://www.ageconcern.org.uk This site comes with a useful guided tour with short cuts to its main sections including news, Age Concern publications, links to other useful websites and a huge range of factsheets on a range of topics for older people which you can read on screen or print. http://www.bbb.org.uk Baby Boomer Bistro is \"an internet chat cafe designed for the over-50s\" set up by Age Concern's sister organisation Age Resource. After registering by choosing a chat name and a password, you to join in online discussions about day-to-day events and topics by visiting different \"rooms\", some with specific themes and some designed for private chats. The rooms are regularly monitored to ensure they are not being abused. http://www.arp.org.uk The website for the Association of Retired and Persons over 50, Britain's largest campaigning organisation for people over 50 with 100,000-plus members. Lots of interesting and useful information on a wide range of topics including health, study, retirement, employment, property, caring, travel and finance, though the association is an introducer for financial products only from CGU Financial Services. Allows you to email your views on various topics. http://www.vavo.com Launched a year ago and now with over 40,000 registered members, this is described as the market leading \"portal\" or \"online community\" for people aged 45 and over where the site contents are largely dictated by what members want. It offers access to a several channels including news, on-line shopping, health, travel, finance and dating, where you can read features and ask questions of experts. You can also access more than 100 topic areas set up and run by members, complete with chat rooms, on anything from hobbies and leisure pursuits to campaigning issues such as lobbying for better pensions and getting older people back to work. So popular is the site that more than 200 members are meeting face-to-face for a weekend in a hotel later this month to celebrate vavo.com's first birthday. http://www.seniority.co.uk Described as an, \"informative, fun and interactive online community created by and for people aged 50(ish!)\", this is a similar, but smaller, idea to vavo.com, though perhaps a bit more tricky to use. http://www.idf50.co.uk \"I don't feel 50\" is a lively site set up in 1998 as \"the first UK site for over 50s\" by Graham Andrews, who felt that existing over-50s organisations tended to be a bit, \"po-faced and institutional\". The aim of the site is to give' \"practical, unbiased help to people aged 50-plus\" and it gives lots of information on a range of serious subjects from financing your retirement to prostate cancer as well as lighter topics such as all-time favourite music albums. Also allows exchange of views via email. http://www.hellsgeriatrics.com An intriguing site which introduces itself by saying: \"For too long the world wide web has been the domain of callow youth. Now it is time for the over-50s to fight back and claim their rightful status in cyberspace.\" It offers chat rooms and a small mix of both serious and fun topics including a section on alien life and a good humour section. Its irreverent tone is set by the caveat: \"HG is a non-profit making organisation but not intentionally so!\" http://www.saga.co.uk As the website for Saga magazine, the UK's largest monthly magazine for people aged 50 and over, this has the current issue online plus a large amount of archived material from past issues. http://www.lifebegins.net This is an online magazine for, \"discerning 50-somethings\" which offers great service for novice silver surfers because it explains the basics of website mechanics so clearly. Its forum section, for example, is,\"an electronic bulletin board on which you can submit your comments and views which stay on the board for three months and to which any number of people can respond\" while its chat section offers, \"instantaneous, simultaneous discussions without a written record of what has been said\".",

      "body": "<p>If figures from the National Centre for Volunteering are to be believed, half the population of the UK - 22 million people of working age - volunteer. They contribute 88 million hours a week to education, homelessness, the environment and many other causes. </p> <p>'One of the strongest and most exciting current trends,' according to the NCV, 'is the number of companies backing their employees to volunteer.' This change, so that companies which used to give money now actively encourage staff to become involved, is partly explained, says the NCV, by the fact that the Government is encouraging business to become more involved in social problems and that companies are recognising the links between profitability and the wellbeing of their community. </p> <p>But the main reason is that 'there are clear benefits for the company and staff - especially in skills development, team-building, enhanced public image and self-confidence', says the NCV. </p> <p>Giving Time: Volunteering in the 21st Century, from the thinktank Demos and Community Service Volunteers (CSV), predicts that this trend will become part of corporate citizenship under the influenceof two pressures: attracting consumers and retaining staff. </p> <p>The report's author, Gavin Mensah-Coker, says: 'People will look not only at prices, quality of services and merchandise but at the company's social policies and practices. Consumers will have more information and will assert their power through spending habits.' The report goes on to say that employee volunteering will be carefully managed and controlled by companies in order to maximise the return on their investment. 'Analytical models will establish the links between community involvement schemes and the profit margin of the company involved.' </p> <p>On the benefits of volunteering for employee retention, Mensah-Coker says: 'With the \"pick and mix\" approach to career development replacing the \"job-for-life\" attitude, employers will have to work much harder to build employee loyalty. Part of that will be giving employees the opportunity to volunteer in company time without penalty, supporting the community in the ways that they choose.' </p> <p>This is already happening through organisations such as CSV. Among the 100,000 people who volunteer through CSV each year are around 4,000 employee volunteers working for 300 different companies. These volunteers generate 36,000 hours of community support. According to CSV's Liz Hover: 'CSV encourages and supports employers who wish to involve their staff as volunteers in the community. This can be either through the management of a project or by providing advice, support and training to companies wishing to run the project themselves.' </p> <p>One of CSV's highest-profile collaborations with business is its partnership with TXU Europe, formerly Eastern Group, the national energy provider. The 'Energy for Action' scheme offers TXU employees regular volunteer placements within their local community. </p> <p>Erol Burns, a finance manager with Eastern Energy, is a volunteer: 'The company lets employees give half a day a month to help a local organisation with CSV and the volunteer must match that with personal time. I joined the scheme just over a year ago and have been working with the Ipswich and East Suffolk branch of Headway, which looks after people with serious head injuries.' </p> <p>By organising and assisting in outdoor activities for patients at Ipswich hospital, Burns saves them the cost of a driver for day trips. 'The outings go extremely well. CSV provides a good support system and the training required. My advice to anyone thinking of volunteering is really just to have the right attitude: keep an open mind and don't be frightened to take on anything. At Headway there are full-time staff, which helps.' </p> <p>He says: 'It is very satisfying to put something into the community, a win-win situation for everyone. It is good for my personal development, seeing how some people have to struggle in their daily lives, as well as the struggle the charity has to make ends meet; and it's good for the company, giving them the opportunity to show their commitment to a wider audience. </p> <p>'I've made a lot of new friends. I go in every second Friday afternoon. I really look forward to it and I know they look forward to my visits - and that's a really lovely feeling.' </p> <p>But volunteering is not always plain sailing. 'There can be pitfalls,' says Burns. 'Employees can find it hard to keep the commitment going. Both the volunteer and the charity have to be flexible. Balancing the pressures between work and the charity isn't always easy, and it can sometimes be hard finding half a day. </p> <p>Yet despite the seeming rise in the number of schemes to encourage volun teering, either through workplace schemes or trying to reach individuals, many voluntary organisations still find it hard to attract volunteers. </p> <p>Mark Walker is development officer at the northern region office of the Alzheimer's Disease Society and a passionate advocate of volunteering. 'We are not sexy at all. We find it hard to attract volunteers because people tend to think that we only deal with dribbling old people smelling of wee. Apart from the fact that that simply isn't the case, you can volunteer without having to have any contact with people with dementia. We pride ourselves on the support we give and the opportunities we provide for personal development. And we offer a range of options, from being a listening ear for carers, providing office support, even decorating an office badly in need of a coat of paint.' </p> <p>For some volunteers, charities can offer the chance of changing careers and finding more fulfilling work. Says Walker: 'One of our volunteers who began on our helpline wanted a more compassionate job than she had at the Benefits Agency. She went on to work for us full time for two years and has now moved to another extremely good job in the voluntary sector.' </p> <p>\u0095 CSV: 020 7278 6601; NCV: 020 7520 8900 </p> <p><strong>How to become involved</strong></p> <p>The following involve giving time or skills to the community, in or out of company time, on a regular or occasional basis: </p> <p><strong> Team challenges</strong><br>These involve events where a group of employees tackle a community problem or task, while building teamworking skills.

I have felt for a while that England would struggle to hold teams out. And much as I love watching Nwankwo Kanu or Gianfranco Zola, it would be nice to see one or two homegrown players emerge determined to protect the goal with their life.",

      "body": "<p>When L'Humanit\u00e9 was shown in Cannes last year, it was jeered to the echo. Many critics mocked the movie, denouncing it for its glacial, pseudo-Bressonian slowness and failure to function plausibly either as a policier or a psychological study. Most damningly of all, it was held to have been a disastrous follow-up to Dumont's much-admired first film, La Vie de J\u00e9sus. </p> <p>But I can't agree. Far from being a disappointment or an artistic wrong turning, Dumont's film is a cogent development from La Vie de J\u00e9sus and nothing less than a masterpiece: haunting, disturbing and daring. It resists the generic boundaries of thriller, or police drama, or realist conventions of any sort, seeming instead to attain the status of some horrifying, extended bad dream which has somehow been tricked out with the superficial appurtenances of real life. Only its inconsistencies and unrealities hint at the fact that the viewer has actually been immersed in a strange nightmare universe: a hyper-real poem of darkness. </p> <p>Just as in La Vie de J\u00e9sus, the action takes place in the grim, undistinguished countryside of northern France. Admirers of that film will remember that its hero Freddy, having been taken into police custody on a serious criminal charge, is for some reason allowed to wander out and lie down in a cornfield for the final shot. Then, Dumont hinted at the discovery of a subversive, even a darkly playful way of subtly modifying the realities of day-to-day life, these realities being the more coercive, and their contravention the more disquieting, for being police realities. </p> <p>In this film, an 11-year-old girl has been brutally raped and murdered. Dumont does not scruple to show the naked corpse, left on the edge of a ploughed field. The camera, in one of its many slow, silent takes, shows tiny ants scurrying over the pitifully pale, bruised skin. But just before this, we have seen Pharaon (Emmanuel Schott\u00e9) running over this field, and collapsing in the mud, his bulging eyes staring straight ahead. Pharaon turns out to be a police superintendent investigating the case and, moreover, a painfully inadequate individual whose strange, torpid manner is due to his girlfriend and baby having recently died. So we are invited to assume that Pharaon is in fact the murderer. </p> <p>Or are we? As the film continues, nothing in Pharaon's behaviour is obviously consistent with the classic template of a deranged murderer gradually disclosing his true self to the camera; in fact his weird running across the field might be some sort of intuitive, premonitory empathy with the victim. </p> <p>Pharaon is to all intents and purposes a simpleton, a virtual village idiot. And yet he is also a police officer, despite the fact that, as one of the locals snarls at him: \"You're too stupid to be a cop!\" Indeed, the entire police department conduct their investigations in what looks like a very lugubrious and casual manner; there seems no systematic interrogation of witnesses, no DNA analysis, and an approach to a local psychiatric hospital is casually suggested by one of the sergeants on the basis that his brother-in-law works there. The top brass from \"Paris and Lille\" are supposed to be helping but nowhere is their big-city sophistication to be seen in the film. </p> <p>But this does not diminish its haunting power, because the police-procedural qualities carry a subtly parodic air; they are a puzzle; they are defiantly at odds with a rational existence. And in any case, they are subservient to the scalp-prickling anxiety and creeping sense of horror that Dumont slowly but surely accumulates, largely through Pharaon's fascination with unpleasant phenomena, such as the beefy sweatiness of his inspector's neck, similar to the revolting pink flesh of a sow and her litter in the farmyard of the victim's family, the queasy panoply of \"humanity\". </p> <p>It is one of the most bizarre, yet somehow inspired touches of this film that Pharaon turns out to be the grandson of a distinguished artist, also called Pharaon De Winter, whose brooding self-portrait Pharaon loans to a local gallery. Is his obsessiveness, his stupefied, faintly malign obsession with pain the remnant of an artistic nature? Like so much else in this captivating film, it is a mystery. </p> <p>L'Humanit\u00e9 demands a considerable investment of attention, and a willingness to enter Dumont's islanded world of violence and dysfunction and accept it partly as an elaborate, visionary metaphor. Once that investment is made, the rewards are very great. Every time I watch it, I am possessed with an Ancient Mariner-like desire to grab the sleeves of passers-by and tell them to see it. Its scenes, its images, its strange atmospherics reverberate ineradicably in the mind.</p>",

But just before this, we have seen Pharaon (Emmanuel Schott\u00e9) running over this field, and collapsing in the mud, his bulging eyes staring straight ahead. Pharaon turns out to be a police superintendent investigating the case and, moreover, a painfully inadequate individual whose strange, torpid manner is due to his girlfriend and baby having recently died. So we are invited to assume that Pharaon is in fact the murderer. Or are we? As the film continues, nothing in Pharaon's behaviour is obviously consistent with the classic template of a deranged murderer gradually disclosing his true self to the camera; in fact his weird running across the field might be some sort of intuitive, premonitory empathy with the victim. Pharaon is to all intents and purposes a simpleton, a virtual village idiot. And yet he is also a police officer, despite the fact that, as one of the locals snarls at him: \"You're too stupid to be a cop!\" Indeed, the entire police department conduct their investigations in what looks like a very lugubrious and casual manner; there seems no systematic interrogation of witnesses, no DNA analysis, and an approach to a local psychiatric hospital is casually suggested by one of the sergeants on the basis that his brother-in-law works there. The top brass from \"Paris and Lille\" are supposed to be helping but nowhere is their big-city sophistication to be seen in the film. But this does not diminish its haunting power, because the police-procedural qualities carry a subtly parodic air; they are a puzzle; they are defiantly at odds with a rational existence. And in any case, they are subservient to the scalp-prickling anxiety and creeping sense of horror that Dumont slowly but surely accumulates, largely through Pharaon's fascination with unpleasant phenomena, such as the beefy sweatiness of his inspector's neck, similar to the revolting pink flesh of a sow and her litter in the farmyard of the victim's family, the queasy panoply of \"humanity\". It is one of the most bizarre, yet somehow inspired touches of this film that Pharaon turns out to be the grandson of a distinguished artist, also called Pharaon De Winter, whose brooding self-portrait Pharaon loans to a local gallery. Is his obsessiveness, his stupefied, faintly malign obsession with pain the remnant of an artistic nature? Like so much else in this captivating film, it is a mystery. L'Humanit\u00e9 demands a considerable investment of attention, and a willingness to enter Dumont's islanded world of violence and dysfunction and accept it partly as an elaborate, visionary metaphor. Once that investment is made, the rewards are very great. Every time I watch it, I am possessed with an Ancient Mariner-like desire to grab the sleeves of passers-by and tell them to see it. Its scenes, its images, its strange atmospherics reverberate ineradicably in the mind.",

After a meeting with various representatives of the European game, the commissioner for education and culture, Viviane Reding, is understood to have agreed that a form of compensation should replace the current system when players move between clubs during their contracts. This compromise will go some way to easing the worries of clubs throughout Europe who feared the consequences of losing transfer income, especially smaller clubs who would have faced bankruptcy. The newly formed Transfer Task Force will now set about framing specific models of compensation to put to the commission by the end of next month. The task force's first meeting is on Tuesday. The ultimate aim is to reach agreement with the commission on a replacement for transfer fees by the end of the year. \"I'm confident that with goodwill from all sides a satisfactory solution is within reach,\" said Reding. \"Between now and October the ball is in the footballers' half of the pitch.\" Uefa, the European game's governing body, which has taken the lead in negotiations with the commission after widespread disillusionment with the world body Fifa's attempts to broker a deal, was equally optimistic.\"We had a very positive and very constructive meeting,\" said Uefa's director of communications Mike Lee. \"It is the first time European football has put its concerns to the commission and they were received very well by Viviane Reding.\" The prime minister Tony Blair had promised to apply governmental pressure to safeguard some form of transfer fee and yesterday won the backing of the German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der for a French-led campaign to keep the system. \"We thought Mr Blair's statement very helpful,\" said Lee. The commission's principal objection to the current system of transfer fees is that the clubs effectively operate as a cartel, preventing the freedom of movement of labour as laid down in the Treaty of Rome. Though Uefa and the European leagues present yesterday acknowledge that some change is necessary to get round this problem, they - and various European governments - argue that football should be treated as a special case because the current system has the benefits of redistributing funds among clubs, financing investment in youth training, maintaining some contractual obligation between player and club, and ensuring a level of compensation for a player's loss.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>VAZ - WHAT IS HE GOOD FOR? </strong></p> <p>The other day the Fiver was at the airport, waving sarcastically as Leicester chairman John Elsom, Leicestershire East MP Keith Vaz and the FA's wonderful David Davies departed for Geneva, armed with only their immeasurable charm and a stack of \"collated information\" from the Foreign Office. Their mission was to persuade Uefa that Belgrade was bandit country, the sort of place that even hardened cowboys like Robbie Savage should avoid - especially on September 28th when Leicester were due to play Red Star Belgrade. And as we saw the airplane finally lift off the ground - which, with Mr Vaz on board, it did with some difficulty - the Fiver confidently predicted they didn't have a hope in hell.</p> <p>And - what do you know? - we were actually right. Well, sort of. Because today Uefa decided that the tie would still go ahead in Belgrade (home of bad man Slobodan Milosevic and a place the Foreign Office advises all Britons to avoid) but announced it will now be played a week earlier, thus avoiding all the civil unrest that's bound to kick off when President Milosevic wangles his way to an unpopular election win. Which is obviously a good thing.</p> <p>Or is it? Because Elsom didn't exactly perform triple salchows with pike at the news. \"We would have found Sofia an acceptable venue for this game as it is only four hours away from Belgrade, and Red Star played Montpellier there last year,\" he whined. \"Throughout my negotiations, the Foreign Office have been advising against non-essential travel to Yugoslavia, which implies there is some risk.\" But just as Balkan War II looked like being set into motion, Elsom relented: \"We certainly would not want to disobey a Uefa directive as that would mean being thrown out of the competition.\" Which means, we assume, that Savage will be let loose on Belgrade. Heaven help them.</p> <p><strong>PRICK UP YOUR EARS</strong></p> <p>The Fiver has only just recovered from the tinnitus caused by He Is Emmanuel Petit's year-long whine regarding his desire to leave Arsenal. So what's the first thing we are presented with the very second our poor battered ears have been nursed back to full health? That's right, an unbearable screeching sound sailing out of the very same man's mouth - and this time he's telling everyone that he never actually asked for a move at all. Gah! Why, we oughta ...</p> <p>\"I never expressed the wish to leave Arsenal,\" the pony-tailed Barcelona midfielder loudly honked in the general direction of France-Football magazine today. \"I was never asked my opinion - that's why I've fallen out with Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein. Instead, I was presented with a fait accompli. In the interest of everyone, that of Arsenal and of myself, I accepted a move - but it wasn't easy. In leaving I am losing friends.\" How selfless is that? What a great guy! And there was us thinking he couldn't get on the plane to Spain fast enough.</p> <p>Oh, hold on, we were right in the first place. \"I'm relieved above all to have finished with so-called English fair play. It's a utopia. They confuse fighting spirit with violence. The fault does not lie with the supporters, but certain younger players who take themselves for cowboys.\" The man with the reading collection of David Icke and the hair of Peter Stringfellow probably had a lot more to say for himself, but by this time we'd taped our ears up. Not for any pre-emptive safety purposes, you understand. We just couldn't be bothered to listen to him any more.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I love the man\" - Peter Taylor on Glenn Hoddle, that beautiful guy bringing his Southampton side to Filbert Street tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>BUFFON ACCUSED OF NAZI SYMPATHIES</strong></p> <p>Parma goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who was last year accused of harbouring Nazi sympathies after appearing on television in a shirt bearing a legend used by fascists in Mussolini's Italy, is preparing to explain himself after it was announced he has requested to wear the number 88 shirt for the upcoming season. The number 88 is used by neo-Nazis to say \"Heil Hitler\", H being the eighth letter of the alphabet.</p> <p>\"We want him to tell us why he chose this number and to change it out of respect for Jews, tziganes [gypsies] and homosexuals,\" Jewish sports official Vittorio Pavoncello told onefootball.com today.

      "bodyText": "VAZ - WHAT IS HE GOOD FOR? The other day the Fiver was at the airport, waving sarcastically as Leicester chairman John Elsom, Leicestershire East MP Keith Vaz and the FA's wonderful David Davies departed for Geneva, armed with only their immeasurable charm and a stack of \"collated information\" from the Foreign Office. Their mission was to persuade Uefa that Belgrade was bandit country, the sort of place that even hardened cowboys like Robbie Savage should avoid - especially on September 28th when Leicester were due to play Red Star Belgrade. And as we saw the airplane finally lift off the ground - which, with Mr Vaz on board, it did with some difficulty - the Fiver confidently predicted they didn't have a hope in hell. And - what do you know? - we were actually right. Well, sort of. Because today Uefa decided that the tie would still go ahead in Belgrade (home of bad man Slobodan Milosevic and a place the Foreign Office advises all Britons to avoid) but announced it will now be played a week earlier, thus avoiding all the civil unrest that's bound to kick off when President Milosevic wangles his way to an unpopular election win. Which is obviously a good thing. Or is it? Because Elsom didn't exactly perform triple salchows with pike at the news. \"We would have found Sofia an acceptable venue for this game as it is only four hours away from Belgrade, and Red Star played Montpellier there last year,\" he whined. \"Throughout my negotiations, the Foreign Office have been advising against non-essential travel to Yugoslavia, which implies there is some risk.\" But just as Balkan War II looked like being set into motion, Elsom relented: \"We certainly would not want to disobey a Uefa directive as that would mean being thrown out of the competition.\" Which means, we assume, that Savage will be let loose on Belgrade. Heaven help them. PRICK UP YOUR EARS The Fiver has only just recovered from the tinnitus caused by He Is Emmanuel Petit's year-long whine regarding his desire to leave Arsenal. So what's the first thing we are presented with the very second our poor battered ears have been nursed back to full health? That's right, an unbearable screeching sound sailing out of the very same man's mouth - and this time he's telling everyone that he never actually asked for a move at all. Gah! Why, we oughta ... \"I never expressed the wish to leave Arsenal,\" the pony-tailed Barcelona midfielder loudly honked in the general direction of France-Football magazine today. \"I was never asked my opinion - that's why I've fallen out with Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein. Instead, I was presented with a fait accompli. In the interest of everyone, that of Arsenal and of myself, I accepted a move - but it wasn't easy. In leaving I am losing friends.\" How selfless is that? What a great guy! And there was us thinking he couldn't get on the plane to Spain fast enough. Oh, hold on, we were right in the first place. \"I'm relieved above all to have finished with so-called English fair play. It's a utopia. They confuse fighting spirit with violence. The fault does not lie with the supporters, but certain younger players who take themselves for cowboys.\" The man with the reading collection of David Icke and the hair of Peter Stringfellow probably had a lot more to say for himself, but by this time we'd taped our ears up. Not for any pre-emptive safety purposes, you understand. We just couldn't be bothered to listen to him any more. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I love the man\" - Peter Taylor on Glenn Hoddle, that beautiful guy bringing his Southampton side to Filbert Street tomorrow. BUFFON ACCUSED OF NAZI SYMPATHIES Parma goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who was last year accused of harbouring Nazi sympathies after appearing on television in a shirt bearing a legend used by fascists in Mussolini's Italy, is preparing to explain himself after it was announced he has requested to wear the number 88 shirt for the upcoming season. The number 88 is used by neo-Nazis to say \"Heil Hitler\", H being the eighth letter of the alphabet. \"We want him to tell us why he chose this number and to change it out of respect for Jews, tziganes [gypsies] and homosexuals,\" Jewish sports official Vittorio Pavoncello told onefootball.com today. Buffon had initially declined to comment, but has agreed to hold a press conference later today to explain his actions. Meanwhile, Parma are sticking up for their player, who has earned an otherwise liberal reputation on the back of much charity work: \"The Jewish community should deal with more serious matters,\" said their director of football Michele Uva. The player's mother has also entered the fray, telling reporters that \"they should be ashamed of thinking such things\". She enigmatically went on to say that Buffon chose the number 88 \"for his own reasons\". THE RUMOUR MILL Aston Villa manager John Gregory has failed in an attempt to sign Steve McManaman from Real Madrid. \"We have spoken to him,\" admitted Gregory. \"But he is going to stick it out at Real and he has not been deterred in any way by the comments their coach has made.\" Patrick Vieira is an \u00a311.5m target for Roma, according to reports. NEWS IN BRIEF Bobby Robson has been named Carling manager of the month for August. Meanwhile, Leeds striker Alan Smith has won the Carling player of the month award. John Gregory will not face a FA disciplinary hearing for his outburst against Chelsea, despite criticising the club for being \"fake pretenders with false illusions\" and accusing them of \"tapping up\" Gareth Southgate. Henning Berg has returned to Blackburn on a three-month loan from Manchester United. The Norwegian central defender said: \"Blackburn has the ability to be a top club again, and has a fiercely ambitious manager. I had no hesitation in agreeing to the deal. If all goes well I'd like it to be a permanent move.\" Cameroon defender Lucien Mettomo has rejected a move to Blackburn. His agent said Mettomo, who plays for Saint Etienne, did not wish to step down a division. Derby striker Branko Strupar has travelled to Germany, where he is expected to have surgery on a hernia problem.

      "body": "<p>Pantaloons, knickerbockers, cigarette pants, drainpipes and combat kecks: there are numerous ways to construct four pieces of rectangular material into a pair of trousers, but am I the only woman in Britain who has difficulty finding a pair of strides to suit her? Didn't think so. I doubt my heart will be the only one to beat a little faster at the news that high-street favourite, Warehouse, has come up with a solution that promises to banish British women's trouser woes: The Collection, launched this month, comprises eight key trouser shapes from tailored lurex to sleek black, with a choice of details including kick flares and back zips, with prices ranging from \u00a330 to \u00a350. This is the first stand-alone trouser collection from a high-street store and is a shrewd homage to the success of the slightly pricier Joseph's Essentials range of trousers, which many lean-limbed shoppers already rely on. So has Warehouse come up trumps? </p> <p>Women have been wearing trousers since the beginning of the last century. Coco Chanel boosted their appeal in the 20s when she introduced \"yachting pants\" to be worn for leisurely pursuits. From working in regulation trousers in factories during the second world war to donning unisex bell bottoms in the 60s, women in trousers became acceptable. Yet it remains difficult to find a pair that flatters, with too few manufacturers understanding the trouser secret: that the length/ waist/bottom ratio has to be right. Trousers don't necessarily have to make you look \"slim\", rather, women are more concerned with making their bottom look \"fit\", that is rounded, pert and not too big. </p> <p>A quick poll among my female friends revealed that each had precise criteria when selecting trousers. For Jane, who is 5ft 3in, the perfect trousers would be \"flattering on my bum, a good length: not too loose or tight, plain not patterned, in a dark colour and with side pockets and front zip\". The ideal pair for Lucy, 5ft 11in, would need to have \"a good butt with the waist fitting perfectly and not gapey. They must not bag at knee and should be sharp and snappy.\" Louise, 5ft 2in, summed up her requirements with, \"my perfect pair of trousers manages to make my legs look longer and my bum smaller\". </p> <p>The majority of women shoppers have a fair idea of what suits them, but there are ways to cheat. The following styles seem to be universally flattering: wide leg, boot leg, flat-fronted, or slightly flared. There are also styles which look universally bad - elasticated waists, for example. Much better to have the waist of your trousers shaped with darts and seams than clenched around your middle with unforgiving elastic. Equally, tapered legs give a larger woman's figure a frog-like look so better to stick to the straight leg, or slightly flared. Trousers cut for a more mature figure, particularly those sold in stores such as M&amp;S, allow extra fabric on the hips, which is forgiving to a pear- shape, although it can lend a \"saddle-bag\" effect to women with narrower hips. </p> <p>If you are short waisted, one word: hipsters. These will create the illusion of a longer upper body - wear a snakey belt on your hips, and suddenly your waist has dropped two inches. Trouser legs should err on the long side - why make your legs look shorter, after all? - with the hem sitting on your shoe. However, a hem that brushes against the floor is best left to the young and trendy in Hoxton. </p> <p>Then there's the underwear issue. Do you want the world to see what sort of knickers you are wearing? Trousers and VPL (visible panty line) have an irritating tendency to go hand in hand and a fleshy rear cut in half by knicker elastic is plain unsexy. The solution is to get friendly with a full-length mirror and a G-string, as trousers that look fabulous from the front could be disastrous from behind. A G-string can be comfortable if you choose cotton versions that are less a \"string\" and more a \"strip\" of fabric. Tight shorts-style briefs also work - hipster versions avoid showing your pants everytime you sit down - and M&amp;S does a range of trouser knickers that lend elasticated support and uplift to your derri\u00e8re. </p> <p>We gathered four women - two over 5ft 10in, the other two only a whisper over 5ft - and shut them in a studio with a rack of trousers from Warehouse, and a few competitors. The problems started when two women, with a height difference of nearly 8in between them, tested the same pair of size 12 trousers. Inevitably, neither found a perfect fit. They were either too long or too short and while trews can be taken up, they can not be taken down. More time was spent trying on than shooting the photographs, with much sticking up of hems and yanking down waist bands in an effort to make hems reach ankles. Warehouse fared well, with thumbs up for the Prince of Wales check (\u00a345) and chalk stripe (\u00a345), but as they don't come in different lengths the taller testers were left disappointed. </p> <p>The designer versus high-street debate is a decision for your pocket rather than your figure. Predictably, the cheaper the trouser, the weaker the cut, as our testers confirmed, but that doesn't mean Miss Selfridge or Oasis won't be trouser heaven for you. Petite ranges are also a good bet for trousers with smaller proportions - try Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Dorothy Perkins. </p> <p>The rule is, if you find a pair that flatters, buy them in every colour - better still, get them made for you. Then you will know that someone somewhere has the template for your perfect trousers ready to be run off in whichever fabric takes your fancy. Trouser nirvana indeed.</p>",

Of course it's not what I wanted to do - I originally combined this bet with Leeds to win away at Coventry (surely good value at 11/10) - but as my hand hovered over my left mouse button, I suddenly saw Blue Square's Patrick Murray, covered in red body paint and with a small stake in his hand, perched on my shoulder.

They are on a high after Wednesday night's comeback at Chelsea, while Bradford have to pick themselves up after their 6-0 mauling in midweek. But didn't Arsenal lose 2-1 to Bradford early this year at Valley Parade, I hear you cry! Yes they did - but this time it will be different.

A continuing blockade by protesting farmers and hauliers prevented dozens of tankers from leaving Shell's Stanlow oil refinery near Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. Lorry drivers were planning a protest later today on the A1 near Gateshead, Tyne &amp; Wear. And farmers warned that demonstrations would continue over the weekend and spread across the country. On the continent, French attempts to blockade the Channel tunnel in a similar protest against fuel prices were thwarted by police. However, with petrol growing extremely scarce in France because of widespread blockades, the UK's Freight Transport Association reported that two British lorry drivers had their vehicles hijacked and diesel fuel syphoned off by protesters in the Cherbourg area. UK Transport Minister Lord Macdonald said British protesters did not have the right to interrupt vital supplies. But David Handley, chairman of Farmers for Action UK warned: \"This is going to be an ongoing situation. I would suggest to you this is going to be the winter of unrest.\" A Shell spokesman at Stanlow said the protest would begin to have an effect on petrol stations throughout the north of England later today. Last night, more than 250 farmers and lorry drivers used vehicles to block the Shell oil refinery. Farmers' spokesman Brynle Williams said demonstrators had travelled from North Wales, Cheshire, Lancashire, Staffordshire and Shropshire to protest at escalating pump prices. Seven fuel tankers were held up outside the plant during the six-hour protest, as police withheld from using their powers to break up the blockade. Organisers warned there will be more action at the weekend. \"The farmers and the road hauliers have now combined and have come to demonstrate their displeasure with the cost of fuel and with the possibility of a three or four pence increase,\" said Mr Williams. Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd, who has met some of the drivers - many of whom were from north Wales - said he could not condone their action, but he sympathised with their predicament. The member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said he feared someone could get hurt if the protests continued and he urged the demonstrators not to break the law. \"They have a case to put to government and I would hope very shortly that government will sit down and reconsider the matter because we are paying well over the odds for fuel in the UK,\" he said. \"One individual told me that his monthly fuel bill has gone up by \u00a31,000 in three months and he has virtually been broken completely now economically...

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that cars, vans or Land Rovers were not a luxury in rural areas, such as his constituency, but a necessity for people to get around because of a lack of reliable public transport. It was \"absolutely ridiculous\" that fuel cost almost \u00a34 a gallon. After the all-night blackade, protesters were given 10 minutes to clear the road and as the deadline passed up to 30 officers filed down the highway. There was uproar in Britain as oil companies announced another rise of 2p on the cost of a litre of fuel. It is now feared that fuel could rise to nearly 87p a litre within weeks, taking the cost of a gallon to \u00a34. The latest increase is due to a rise in the price of crude oil; oil producers' body Opec will meet in Vienna on Sunday to discuss the issue.",

Research has revealed that most parents, especially fathers, feel ill-equipped to teach their children the facts of life. School sex lessons are considered embarrassing and often leave children in desperate need of more information. The government is keen to produce a new \"non-judgmental\" campaign simply setting out the facts about sex and sexual love. <p><b>Why is the problem so acute?</b><br> The UK has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe with some 90,000 conceptions a year - nearly four times as many as most countries and seven times as many as the Netherlands. Studies suggest that on average 25% of teenagers have had sex before they are 16. Young people who are sexually active before they are 16 are less likely to use contraceptives and more likely to regret their first sexual relationships. A survey published today by the Family Education Trust claims that children under the age of 16 from broken homes are twice as likely to be sexually active than those living with two parents.</p> <p><b>What do children and young people think of the way they are taught sex education?</b><br> Most believe that they should receive sex education at school. Surveys by the Sex Education Forum, an umbrella organisation for groups with interests in issues such as health, education and religion, have found that more than two-thirds of nine-year-olds think they should be taught sex education in the classroom. 60% of young teenagers, meanwhile, believe that serious sex education should start in junior school between the ages of nine and 11. They say they want open and honest discussion, not only about the physical act but about feelings and relationships, including homosexuality, and real-life dilemmas.</p> <p><b>What obligations do schools have to provide sex education?</b><br> The basic biology of reproduction is set out in National Curriculum science, compulsory for all pupils aged between five and 16. Secondary schools must also give lessons on HIV and Aids and sexually transmitted diseases. After that, it is up to individual governing bodies in both primary and secondary schools - in consultation with parents - to formulate policies setting out what additional sex education they will be giving. Parents are allowed to examine this policy and withdraw children from any sex education outside the National Curriculum if they desire. Many schools are also beginning to teach education as part of the new \"personal, social and health and education and citizenship framework\" published last year. Among the aims of the framework is \"developing good relationships and respecting the differences between people\". Campaigners believe sex education in schools remains \"patchy\" - excellent in some places, almost non-existent in others. There is also criticism that what is taught can be \"over-biological\".</p> <p><b>Are schools allowed to teach about issues such as homosexuality?</b><br> Yes. Though Section 28 - which outlaws the \"promotion\" of homosexuality in schools by local authorities - remains on the statute books, it does not in reality impact on schools. No prosecution has ever been initiated under its terms and local authorities no longer run schools anyway. However it does cause anxiety for some teachers and legitimise the wishes of those who, for personal reasons, do not want to teach about homosexuality. The various acts covering what may be taught in schools do not specifically prohibit the discussion of certain sexual issues. However, a teacher may wish to seek advice if, for example, a pupil asks a question about an illegal act. If a child admits to under-age sex, a teacher should encourage him or her to seek professional and parental advice.</p> <p><b>What role should parents play in sex education?</b><br> Experts agree that parents must get involved. The Sex Education Forum encourages parents to \"start early\" - children need to be told about body changes and feelings before they experience them. More than one in ten girls start their periods before being told anything about them. Children will get sex education anyway from peers, from older children and from the media. The messages might well be confusing. Most experts believe that parents should begin teaching their children sex education when they start asking questions - this will probably be before primary school age. More than 95% of parents want schools to teach sex education and most wish they had had more sex education when they were at school.</p> <p><b>What other sources are available for a young person seeking sex education?</b><br> Access to the internet has opened up almost endless sources of information for young people. There are any number of websites giving children and young people access to information about sex. And earlier this year the Brook Advisory Centre came in for criticism for producing what was described as a \"good grope guide\" aimed at 14-year-olds. It described how teenagers could have fun without having full sex, but caused some headteachers and family campaigners to claim that it could encourage underage sex. </p> <p><b>How will the new campaign differ?</b><br> As the campaign is still in the planning stage, few details about it have emerged. Ministers are determined that it will not be judgmental but will provide young people with the facts they need. It might well be based around a single central idea based on love and sexual attraction, encapsulated in a jingle or slogan. It will also encourage parents to talk to their children. The campaign, however, is likely to be controversial with some church figures, right-wing morality groups and some parents if it does not give a clear message that underage sex is wrong and sex within marriage the ideal.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.famyouth.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Family Education Trust</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.ncb.org.uk/sexed.htm\" target=\"_new\">Sex Education Forum</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.nc.uk.net/\" target=\"_new\">National Curriculum</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.sexinfo.org.uk/brook.htm\" target=\"_new\">Brook Advisory Centre</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,184654,00.html\">Section 28</a></p>",

A car driver has told police a white van pulled out of the lane beside the field where Sarah's body was found, at around 11pm on July 1, the night she vanished. The Transit-style van then pulled out in front out in front of a white lorry, forcing it to brake suddenly, before the car, lorry and van all drove north up the A29. Police are now desperate to find the driver of the 35ft-long lorry, who they believe could have seen the eight-year-old's killer just after he dumped her naked body in a field beside the A29, just north of Pulborough, West Sussex. Detective Superintendent Peter Kennet, who is leading the inquiry, said: \"You could perhaps be one of the key witnesses to the entire inquiry as to what you actually saw on the night of Saturday July 1.\" He continued: \"\"Sarah probably was buried at about that time, so therefore you have seen the vehicle that carried Sarah's murderer.\" Sarah's brother Lee, 13, has told police he saw a white Transit-style van in the lane where she vanished, just minutes after she started to walk home alone towards her grandparents' home in Kingston, West Sussex, at about 7.45pm. The car driver, from London, contacted police on July 29 to tell them what he had seen. He had been following the lorry for about 10 miles before they reached Pulborough.

The car driver has also given police details about the white van, which detectives say fit the description of the van spotted by Lee Payne, but he did not see the van's driver. Mr Kennet said the van pulled out sharply from the track beside the field where Sarah's body was found and said the lorry had been forced to brake sharply to avoid a crash. He said the van only had its sidelights on and was described as a \"ghost vehicle\" by the car driver. The van turned off the A29 and headed towards Barns Green, about four miles north of the spot where Sarah's body was found on July 17. The murder hunt has now cost more than \u00a31m, with 50 officers working on the case. Police have spoken to more than 5,000 people and taken more than 1,000 statements.

      "body": "<p>William Hague suffered a blow to his election campaign last night when it emerged that a central plank of his manifesto would cost \u00a35bn, a sum that would add 2p to the basic rate of income tax.</p> <p>After the Conservative leader unveiled his pre-election manifesto this week with a pledge to reform the basic state pension, Labour released figures indicating that his plans would cost billions of pounds and jeopardise the income of pensioners.</p> <p>Mr Hague tried to woo young voters when he pledged to offer them the chance to save for retirement through a state-funded alternative to the basic state pension. Anyone who opted for the scheme would pay less in national insurance to allow them to build up a private or occupational pension scheme.</p> <p>The Tories refused to be drawn on how much their pension would cost, saying that the plan was still on drawing board. This left the way clear for Labour, which last night released an analysis to the Guardian. The costing, drawn up by the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, said the loss of national insurance revenue proposed would lead to a \u00a35bn \"black hole\" within five years \"if only half of those under the age of 45 opted out of paying national insurance. \"</p> <p>\"However, if everyone opted out - as seems likely, given this is a one-way bet - this would double the costs: \u00a310bn of lost national insurance contributions in five years time.\"</p> <p>Mr Darling claimed that the huge cost of the scheme highlighted the \"irresponsible\" approach to spending adopted by the Tories, who committed themselves in their manifesto to cut spending by \u00a316bn.</p> <p>However, the scheme also poses a threat to the pensioners of today because their weekly pensions are funded from current national insurance contributions.</p> <p>Mr Darling said last night that the scheme showed that the Tory party was \"out to lunch\" on tax and spending.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"This plan is economically illiterate. It can be funded only by increasing taxes, increasing borrowing or lowering pensions. This is ill thought out.\"</p> <p>He demonstrated Labour's determination to concentrate on the Tories' approach to tax and spending by mocking Mr Hague for his boast he would shave billions off the government's spending plans while the Tory leader was simultaneously dreaming up uncosted policies. \"For 18 years the Tories pilloried us over tax and spending,\" he said. \"Now their tax and spending plans are falling apart at the seams.\"</p> <p>Mr Darling's assault on the pension scheme will add weight to critics of Mr Hague who believe that he made a mistake by unveiling such an important policy without apparently thinking it through.</p> <p>Some Tories believe that the leadership had not realised that the plan would attract attention, and had expected the shadow social security secretary, David Willetts, to be given a free run when he presented it later this month.</p> <p>However, Labour wasted no time, attacking it as a backdoor privatisation of the state pension - an attack echoing the devastating onslaught on the Tories' pension plans in 1997 that killed off John Major's election campaign.</p> <p>The Tories will say Mr Darling's figures are grossly exaggerated.

      "bodyText": "William Hague suffered a blow to his election campaign last night when it emerged that a central plank of his manifesto would cost \u00a35bn, a sum that would add 2p to the basic rate of income tax. After the Conservative leader unveiled his pre-election manifesto this week with a pledge to reform the basic state pension, Labour released figures indicating that his plans would cost billions of pounds and jeopardise the income of pensioners. Mr Hague tried to woo young voters when he pledged to offer them the chance to save for retirement through a state-funded alternative to the basic state pension. Anyone who opted for the scheme would pay less in national insurance to allow them to build up a private or occupational pension scheme. The Tories refused to be drawn on how much their pension would cost, saying that the plan was still on drawing board. This left the way clear for Labour, which last night released an analysis to the Guardian. The costing, drawn up by the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, said the loss of national insurance revenue proposed would lead to a \u00a35bn \"black hole\" within five years \"if only half of those under the age of 45 opted out of paying national insurance. \" \"However, if everyone opted out - as seems likely, given this is a one-way bet - this would double the costs: \u00a310bn of lost national insurance contributions in five years time.\" Mr Darling claimed that the huge cost of the scheme highlighted the \"irresponsible\" approach to spending adopted by the Tories, who committed themselves in their manifesto to cut spending by \u00a316bn. However, the scheme also poses a threat to the pensioners of today because their weekly pensions are funded from current national insurance contributions. Mr Darling said last night that the scheme showed that the Tory party was \"out to lunch\" on tax and spending. He told the Guardian: \"This plan is economically illiterate. It can be funded only by increasing taxes, increasing borrowing or lowering pensions. This is ill thought out.\" He demonstrated Labour's determination to concentrate on the Tories' approach to tax and spending by mocking Mr Hague for his boast he would shave billions off the government's spending plans while the Tory leader was simultaneously dreaming up uncosted policies. \"For 18 years the Tories pilloried us over tax and spending,\" he said. \"Now their tax and spending plans are falling apart at the seams.\" Mr Darling's assault on the pension scheme will add weight to critics of Mr Hague who believe that he made a mistake by unveiling such an important policy without apparently thinking it through. Some Tories believe that the leadership had not realised that the plan would attract attention, and had expected the shadow social security secretary, David Willetts, to be given a free run when he presented it later this month. However, Labour wasted no time, attacking it as a backdoor privatisation of the state pension - an attack echoing the devastating onslaught on the Tories' pension plans in 1997 that killed off John Major's election campaign. The Tories will say Mr Darling's figures are grossly exaggerated. However, Labour believes they are in a muddle over their spending plans. The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, said at the launch of the mini manifesto that it was \"fiscally neutral\", with any spending increases balanced by savings. At the same time he refused to be drawn on his tax and spending plans, saying they would be unveiled later.",

A further six people suffered critical injuries in the Nevada crash. Rick Palmer, of the University of Nevada Medical Centre, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper that a 72-year-old man had both his arms severed near the elbows. The crash scene is five hours by road from both Las Vegas and Reno and casualties have been transferred to hospitals in both cities by helicopter and aeroplane. \"The driver for an unknown reason went off the road, crossing both lanes and went off the left hand shoulder of the highway,\" Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Trooper Richard James said. The coach was carrying 39 passengers, a tour director and driver, said a spokesman for British tour operator Archers Direct, who chartered the coach from a Californian firm. Mr James later confirmed 27 casualties were being taken to Washoe Medical Centre and the bus involved was a triple-axle Prevost registered in 1999. \"We're not sure if speed was a factor and weather conditions were clear and there was no wind,\" he said. A spokesman for Bromley-based Archers Direct said: \"Senior personnel are currently en route from the UK and staff in the USA are co-operating fully with the local authorities to determine the cause of the crash.

      "bodyText": "BBC director general Greg Dyke today led TV industry tributes to Bruce Gyngell, who died last night. Dyke, who worked with Gyngell during his days at breakfast broadcaster TV-am, said: \"Bruce was one of the more colourful characters in our business. He was widely liked. The industry will be a duller place without him.\" Gyngell, 71, who was managing director of TV-am in the 1980s, died after a battle with cancer last night in the private Lister Hospital, in Chelsea. The first face to appear on Australian TV in 1957, Gyngell was brought in to revive TV-am in 1984. The Australian-born TV executive was also managing director of ATV in the 1970s and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television in the 1990s. The news was announced this morning by David Keighley, a family friend and formerly director of corporate affairs at TV-am.",

      "body": "<p>Swirling paisley prints, mirror work, bejewelled flip flops: there is no doubt that Indian-influenced fashion has been enjoying an extraordinary popularity for the past few seasons in the west. Leaving aside the pashmina palaver of two years ago, which was more of a fad than an interest in Indian fashion, it can be seen across the high streets and on celebrities. Gold detailing and fringed shawls have been repeated to the point of cliche. Madonna sported a bindi in her video for Frozen and even Boyzone have been spotted with decorative henna work adorning their bodies. Yet something is strikingly missing here. There is a complete dearth of prominent Indian fashion designers in the west. </p> <p>Part of the problem lies, ironically, with our established appreciation of Indian fashion: it has already arrived, albeit in derivative forms. Designers such as Stella McCartney, John Galliano, Matthew Williamson, Jade Jagger and Gaultier have long been experimenting with Indian-inspired fashion - to the point that Indian designers themselves might not have sufficient novelty to swerve the cameras of the international media away from the familiar faces of Galliano et al. </p> <p>So it is a shame that last month's first India Fashion Week provoked such a lukewarm response in its own country and has received relatively little attention overseas. </p> <p>Lamke India Fashion Week, held in New Delhi over six days, showed the collections of 33 Indian designers. It marked the first attempt by the recently formed Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) to bring Indian designers to global prominence. Although fashion shows have been held in India for the past 15 years, they were genteel, quaintly old-fashioned affairs: a designer would show on his own and it was a glam evening, replete with cocktails. The fashion week was a long-overdue attempt to showcase the talents of as many Indian designers as possible and attract the attention of international buyers and media. </p> <p>The FDCI's attempts to sell the Indian fashion industry to the west were apparent throughout: designers were instructed to use western approaches in their designs, such as concentrating on ready to wear rather than couture; many showed a mix of eastern and western clothes; and some used western models, such as Jodie Kidd. </p> <p>Teething problems, though, were apparent. The Hindu, India's national newspaper, dubbed the affair \"a farce\", complaining that some shows did not begin on time. \"Many of the shows were running late and some of the designers had very short notice,\" concedes Gitanjali Kashyap, fashion designer and member of the FDCI. Jodie Kidd disagrees: \"I had a really great time in India. Now I'm just looking forward to going back again.\" </p> <p>The designers believe that the poor fashion industry infrastructure in India is the main obstacle to their attempts to break into western markets. \"India doesn't really have a retail system, so designers don't have any real back-up,\" says designer Rina Dhaka. </p> <p>Nina Patel, a designer for the eastern clothing company Red Blue Purple, based in London and Bombay, is pragmatic about the situation: \"There are just so many manufacturing problems in India. Buyers need to be able to fax through requests and know that samples will turn up on time. So no, at the moment India can't compete with London, Paris, New York and Milan, but it can with places like Hong Kong.\" </p> <p>Fellow designer Manoviraj Khosla points out the central irony of the Indian fashion industry: \"Lots of American and British stores source from India and have factories here, such as Nicole Farhi, French Connection and The Gap. Indian designers need to make their own labels, not just work in production for western companies.\" </p> <p>Many eastern designers are more than willing to accommodate their designs to western tastes and needs. Two months ago shopmahal.com, a British based website, was launched, targeting the non-Asian press. It allows visitors to learn about and buy all elements of Indian fashion, from food to clothes to health treatments. The website's PR officer, Vaishali Shah, explains: \"Six months ago we saw how all things Indian were really gaining momentum in Britain, and we wanted to take advantage of this. It's funny, two years ago I would not have worn a mirror choker or a bindi in this country because I would have thought they were 'too Indian'. Now it's trendy to wear them, especially with western clothing.\" </p> <p>Britain's links with India mean that this country might be the most fertile and accommodating ground for raising the profile of Indian designers. The current vogue for individuality and authenticity suggests a growing market for real Indian designs. Rina Dhaka's clothes, for example, have been worn by Naomi Campbell and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, and the TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss is one of Nina Patel's most loyal clients. Part of the attraction of Lamke India Fashion Week for Jodie Kidd was to see the origins of the styles she has worn for western fashion designers. \"So many designers I've worked for have been influenced by designs from the east. So I have always really wanted to go there.\" </p> <p>Whether India can break into the stronghold of the four main fashion cities is another matter. Wealthier, more established fashion weeks - Brazil, Toronto, Hong Kong - have failed to do so. But for the moment, most of the Indian designers would just be happy with some western acknowledgement. \"I'm not angry at the west, it's just frustrating that they don't know anything about Indian fashion,\" says Gitanjali Kashyap. </p> <p>The former president of the fashion house Chloe, Mounir Moufarriage, the man who recruited Stella McCartney, announced this week that he has formed a partnership with Indian designer Ritu Beri, who also showed in the fashion week. He hopes to launch her first ready-to-wear collection in the US in early October. \"The quality is outstanding, far beyond what you would expect,\" he has said. \"I think we could see a lot more from India in the next three to five years.\"</p>",

So no, at the moment India can't compete with London, Paris, New York and Milan, but it can with places like Hong Kong.\" Fellow designer Manoviraj Khosla points out the central irony of the Indian fashion industry: \"Lots of American and British stores source from India and have factories here, such as Nicole Farhi, French Connection and The Gap. Indian designers need to make their own labels, not just work in production for western companies.\" Many eastern designers are more than willing to accommodate their designs to western tastes and needs. Two months ago shopmahal.com, a British based website, was launched, targeting the non-Asian press. It allows visitors to learn about and buy all elements of Indian fashion, from food to clothes to health treatments. The website's PR officer, Vaishali Shah, explains: \"Six months ago we saw how all things Indian were really gaining momentum in Britain, and we wanted to take advantage of this. It's funny, two years ago I would not have worn a mirror choker or a bindi in this country because I would have thought they were 'too Indian'. Now it's trendy to wear them, especially with western clothing.\" Britain's links with India mean that this country might be the most fertile and accommodating ground for raising the profile of Indian designers. The current vogue for individuality and authenticity suggests a growing market for real Indian designs. Rina Dhaka's clothes, for example, have been worn by Naomi Campbell and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, and the TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss is one of Nina Patel's most loyal clients. Part of the attraction of Lamke India Fashion Week for Jodie Kidd was to see the origins of the styles she has worn for western fashion designers. \"So many designers I've worked for have been influenced by designs from the east. So I have always really wanted to go there.\" Whether India can break into the stronghold of the four main fashion cities is another matter. Wealthier, more established fashion weeks - Brazil, Toronto, Hong Kong - have failed to do so. But for the moment, most of the Indian designers would just be happy with some western acknowledgement. \"I'm not angry at the west, it's just frustrating that they don't know anything about Indian fashion,\" says Gitanjali Kashyap. The former president of the fashion house Chloe, Mounir Moufarriage, the man who recruited Stella McCartney, announced this week that he has formed a partnership with Indian designer Ritu Beri, who also showed in the fashion week. He hopes to launch her first ready-to-wear collection in the US in early October. \"The quality is outstanding, far beyond what you would expect,\" he has said. \"I think we could see a lot more from India in the next three to five years.\"",

      "body": "<p>Tim Aspinall, who has died aged 65, was a television writer, director, producer and a true original. In the 1960s he wrote and produced Coronation Street. He scripted series ranging from Love Story for ATV, to Villains and Bullman for Granada and a BBC Horizon drama documentary on Brunel.</p> <p>In 1972 he produced a landmark Thirty Minute Theatre production of Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape for BBC television. It featured Patrick Magee, the writer's finest interpreter, in the name role. Later in that decade at Thames Television, working with his close friend Verity Lambert, Tim produced Hazell, Born And Bred, Jemima Shore Investigates - for which he also wrote - and other popular, well-crafted series. He directed drama and documentaries - including Channel 4's Wine Programme and What It's Worth - and, at TVS, in the late 1980s, helped me to develop and encourage many young writers, directors and producers.</p> <p>I first met him towards the end of 1968 when he arrived at BBC Television Centre to script-edit and, soon afterwards, produce BBC2's Thirty Minute Theatre. Tim regaled us with tales of Fleet Street and Granadaland, and charmed us with his witty, sometimes racy, west London anecdotes. And, with a laidback and assured style, he delivered an extraordinary run of original television drama, week after week.</p> <p>Tim wrote many fine, often quirky scripts himself - with dialogue often close to poetry - and produced startlingly electric drama; no more so than with Rhys Adrian. At the BBC, in the early 1970s, Rhys and Tim - and I, and others - delivered television plays that included The Gardeners Of My Youth, Buffet and the brilliant Thrills Galore.</p> <p>Tim was born in Hampstead, London. His father, an army officer, was killed in Burma during the second world war, while his mother was a Spanish aristocrat of Basque origin. He was educated at Beaumont school and in his late teens joined the Eastbourne Gazette. A holiday relief stint at the Daily Mail turned into a job and he later worked at the Mirror and Express. In 1964 he went to Granada in Manchester as a script-editor, and took a director's course with the company.</p> <p>In the 1970s, post-BBC, he remained a freelance, but joined me at TVS in 1987 and never left my side during the five years I was controller of drama. He produced the first series of Perfect Scoundrels, several single plays, a strand of student films and videos, Take One, where his talent as a teacher augmented his producing brilliance.</p> <p>Tim loved life, and celebrating activities that he could share with others - cricket, jazz, soccer, classical music, the arts, wine, and eating and cooking good food - his bread-making talents were legendary and he never arrived anywhere without a warm loaf from his oven.</p> <p>Tim married first Judy, with whom he spent his 20s and very early 30s, together with James, Penny and Matty. Early in his BBC life he married his perfect foil, Mary, and they adopted Ruby and Charlie.</p> <p><b> Richard Harris writes: </b> I first met Tim Aspinall when we were young writers on an anthology of television plays produced by the inspiring Stella Richman. He wrote like a dream; his stuff didn't always work and sometimes it was so far off the wall it was out of the building, but it was always full of ideas, full of imagination. Tim had style in the way he was with people - and a kind of subversion about him.</p> <p>The second time we worked together it was with him as director, the third time as producer. Working with him was always a pleasure. It wasn't the be-all and end-all for him, but if the work could somehow lead to the real stuff of life, so much the better.

      "bodyText": "Tim Aspinall, who has died aged 65, was a television writer, director, producer and a true original. In the 1960s he wrote and produced Coronation Street. He scripted series ranging from Love Story for ATV, to Villains and Bullman for Granada and a BBC Horizon drama documentary on Brunel. In 1972 he produced a landmark Thirty Minute Theatre production of Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape for BBC television. It featured Patrick Magee, the writer's finest interpreter, in the name role. Later in that decade at Thames Television, working with his close friend Verity Lambert, Tim produced Hazell, Born And Bred, Jemima Shore Investigates - for which he also wrote - and other popular, well-crafted series. He directed drama and documentaries - including Channel 4's Wine Programme and What It's Worth - and, at TVS, in the late 1980s, helped me to develop and encourage many young writers, directors and producers. I first met him towards the end of 1968 when he arrived at BBC Television Centre to script-edit and, soon afterwards, produce BBC2's Thirty Minute Theatre. Tim regaled us with tales of Fleet Street and Granadaland, and charmed us with his witty, sometimes racy, west London anecdotes. And, with a laidback and assured style, he delivered an extraordinary run of original television drama, week after week. Tim wrote many fine, often quirky scripts himself - with dialogue often close to poetry - and produced startlingly electric drama; no more so than with Rhys Adrian. At the BBC, in the early 1970s, Rhys and Tim - and I, and others - delivered television plays that included The Gardeners Of My Youth, Buffet and the brilliant Thrills Galore. Tim was born in Hampstead, London. His father, an army officer, was killed in Burma during the second world war, while his mother was a Spanish aristocrat of Basque origin. He was educated at Beaumont school and in his late teens joined the Eastbourne Gazette. A holiday relief stint at the Daily Mail turned into a job and he later worked at the Mirror and Express. In 1964 he went to Granada in Manchester as a script-editor, and took a director's course with the company. In the 1970s, post-BBC, he remained a freelance, but joined me at TVS in 1987 and never left my side during the five years I was controller of drama. He produced the first series of Perfect Scoundrels, several single plays, a strand of student films and videos, Take One, where his talent as a teacher augmented his producing brilliance. Tim loved life, and celebrating activities that he could share with others - cricket, jazz, soccer, classical music, the arts, wine, and eating and cooking good food - his bread-making talents were legendary and he never arrived anywhere without a warm loaf from his oven. Tim married first Judy, with whom he spent his 20s and very early 30s, together with James, Penny and Matty. Early in his BBC life he married his perfect foil, Mary, and they adopted Ruby and Charlie. Richard Harris writes: I first met Tim Aspinall when we were young writers on an anthology of television plays produced by the inspiring Stella Richman. He wrote like a dream; his stuff didn't always work and sometimes it was so far off the wall it was out of the building, but it was always full of ideas, full of imagination. Tim had style in the way he was with people - and a kind of subversion about him. The second time we worked together it was with him as director, the third time as producer. Working with him was always a pleasure. It wasn't the be-all and end-all for him, but if the work could somehow lead to the real stuff of life, so much the better. But the work always got done and always to his high standards - and with that little bit extra on the budget. We fell out about five years ago, but I really missed working with him. And then, about a couple of years ago, I was taken seriously ill. One afternoon there was Tim, parking his bike in the front garden. He had brought me some home-made soup and we were off and running again. I am not saying he saved my life, but he was one of those who made bloody sure I hung on to it.

Two days after his first operation I went to see him and he was dancing with a nurse, trailing his tubes behind him. He was sent home to build up strength for his second operation: he still gave me cooking lessons, and we still went to the pictures in the afternoon.

Complications set in. He died 10 days later. He was a very special man, a one-off. Timothy Edward Aspinall, writer and television producer, born January 6 1935; died August 21 2000",

But falling ratings, tired ideas and an uninspiring presenter line-up have led Channel 4 to wonder whether there is a future for the Big Breakfast's diet of early morning mania. </p> <p>Executives are discussing whether to axe the show, after failing to persuade the current host, Johnny Vaughan, to reconsider his decision to quit. Competition is intensifying: GMTV and BBC1 are relaunching their breakfast programmes, while cable and satellite channels are capturing more young viewers in the early morning. The show has lost more than half its audience in five years. </p> <p>At the very least, the Big Breakfast will undergo a radical revamp when Vaughan leaves at the end of the year. In a final attempt to shore up the programme, Outen is being brought back to parry Vaughan's tired jokes. </p> <p>A Channel 4 executive said that in a wide-ranging review the only certainty was that the principle of \"fun at breakfast\" would be maintained; there would be no question of launching a news service to rival GMTV or BBC1. </p> <p>The show may survive in its present form if a suitably charismatic pair of presenters can be found. Dermot O'Leary, host of Channel 4's hugely successful Sunday morning strand, T4, has been standing in for Vaughan during the summer and may be offered a permanent position. </p> <p>However, critics point out that even when Vaughan fronted the Big Breakfast with Outen, praise from the press was not matched by a boost in ratings. Only its high media profile has stopped the axe from falling earlier. Its audience now languishes at 400,000, almost as low as the terrible ratings that prompted the replacement of its predecessor, the Channel 4 Daily. </p> <p>The Big Breakfast was the brainchild of Charlie Parsons, who was behind Network 7 and The Word. With his partner, Waheed Alli, and their friend Sebastian Scott, he launched Evans and Roslin to the screens in 1992. Soon the show was gaining more than 1m viewers. </p> <p>Many of its regular features achieved cult status, and its success in attracting youth audiences came from its canny sense of kitsch. Paula Yates would interview celebrities in a bed, Keith Chegwin hosted off-beat location reports, and Lily Savage made regular appearances. The mix was held together by a strong line-up of presenters, led by Evans. </p> <p>But since his departure, the show has lacked buzz. There was a disastrous relaunch fronted by Sharron Davies, but the arrival of Vaughan and Outen heralded a revival in critical acclaim, if not in ratings. </p> <p>Scott said Channel 4 should aim its breakfast show away from the overcrowded youth and children's market: \"They should be servicing viewers who don't want to watch GMTV. There's an entire generation of people who have nothing to watch in the morning.\" </p> <p>The BBC is pinning its hopes for a breakfast revival on a new show starting October 2, with the foreign correspondent Jeremy Bowen and the newsreader Moira Stuart. GMTV is offering a new set, some new presenters and a harder journalistic edge. </p> <p><strong>Highlights: sex sparks</strong></p> <p>\u0095 The Big Breakfast was launched in a blaze of publicity in 1992. Paula Yates set the tone when she turned up to meet the press in a dress made of artificial turf and covered in daisies and veg. Gaby Roslin's debut almost never happened: she was the replacement for Emma Forbes, who pulled out shortly before the launch. </p> <p>\u0095 The tempestuous relationship between Yates and Michael Hutchence is due in no small part to the Big Breakfast. In her regular slot, Yates - then married to Bob Geldof, co-owner of the show's producer, Planet 24 - interviewed the rock star in bed, where she displayed a level of intimacy that was steamy even by her flirtatious standards. The rest is showbiz history. </p> <p>\u0095 After the departure of Gaby Roslin, ratings continued to fall, and the show underwent a radical relaunch. However, the sparks of sexual chemistry failed to fly between the children's TV presenter Rick Adams and the former champion swimmer Sharron Davies. The only good thing to come out of the debacle was the employment of Denise Van Outen as the flying weather girl, whose ability to bellow over the roar of the helicopter resulted in her promotion to Johnny Vaughan's side. </p> <p>\u0095 The Big Breakfast has been the launchpad for a number of successful showbiz careers - but not for others. Kelly Brook, plucked from an obscure career as a lingerie model, ended her brief stint when producers became fed up with her difficulty in reading long words on her script. They had to be spelled phonetically. </p> <p>\u0095 Johnny Vaughan's hyperactive style, which has been the cornerstone of the show's critical success, has occasionally landed him in hot water. He regularly rants against the French, the Germans and the Millennium Dome. A particularly ill-advised tirade against travelling people brought a flood of complaints to Channel 4 - and Gypsy curses.</p>",

The show has lost more than half its audience in five years. At the very least, the Big Breakfast will undergo a radical revamp when Vaughan leaves at the end of the year. In a final attempt to shore up the programme, Outen is being brought back to parry Vaughan's tired jokes. A Channel 4 executive said that in a wide-ranging review the only certainty was that the principle of \"fun at breakfast\" would be maintained; there would be no question of launching a news service to rival GMTV or BBC1. The show may survive in its present form if a suitably charismatic pair of presenters can be found. Dermot O'Leary, host of Channel 4's hugely successful Sunday morning strand, T4, has been standing in for Vaughan during the summer and may be offered a permanent position. However, critics point out that even when Vaughan fronted the Big Breakfast with Outen, praise from the press was not matched by a boost in ratings. Only its high media profile has stopped the axe from falling earlier. Its audience now languishes at 400,000, almost as low as the terrible ratings that prompted the replacement of its predecessor, the Channel 4 Daily. The Big Breakfast was the brainchild of Charlie Parsons, who was behind Network 7 and The Word. With his partner, Waheed Alli, and their friend Sebastian Scott, he launched Evans and Roslin to the screens in 1992. Soon the show was gaining more than 1m viewers. Many of its regular features achieved cult status, and its success in attracting youth audiences came from its canny sense of kitsch. Paula Yates would interview celebrities in a bed, Keith Chegwin hosted off-beat location reports, and Lily Savage made regular appearances. The mix was held together by a strong line-up of presenters, led by Evans. But since his departure, the show has lacked buzz. There was a disastrous relaunch fronted by Sharron Davies, but the arrival of Vaughan and Outen heralded a revival in critical acclaim, if not in ratings. Scott said Channel 4 should aim its breakfast show away from the overcrowded youth and children's market: \"They should be servicing viewers who don't want to watch GMTV. There's an entire generation of people who have nothing to watch in the morning.\" The BBC is pinning its hopes for a breakfast revival on a new show starting October 2, with the foreign correspondent Jeremy Bowen and the newsreader Moira Stuart. GMTV is offering a new set, some new presenters and a harder journalistic edge. Highlights: sex sparks \u0095 The Big Breakfast was launched in a blaze of publicity in 1992. Paula Yates set the tone when she turned up to meet the press in a dress made of artificial turf and covered in daisies and veg. Gaby Roslin's debut almost never happened: she was the replacement for Emma Forbes, who pulled out shortly before the launch. \u0095 The tempestuous relationship between Yates and Michael Hutchence is due in no small part to the Big Breakfast. In her regular slot, Yates - then married to Bob Geldof, co-owner of the show's producer, Planet 24 - interviewed the rock star in bed, where she displayed a level of intimacy that was steamy even by her flirtatious standards. The rest is showbiz history. \u0095 After the departure of Gaby Roslin, ratings continued to fall, and the show underwent a radical relaunch. However, the sparks of sexual chemistry failed to fly between the children's TV presenter Rick Adams and the former champion swimmer Sharron Davies. The only good thing to come out of the debacle was the employment of Denise Van Outen as the flying weather girl, whose ability to bellow over the roar of the helicopter resulted in her promotion to Johnny Vaughan's side. \u0095 The Big Breakfast has been the launchpad for a number of successful showbiz careers - but not for others. Kelly Brook, plucked from an obscure career as a lingerie model, ended her brief stint when producers became fed up with her difficulty in reading long words on her script. They had to be spelled phonetically. \u0095 Johnny Vaughan's hyperactive style, which has been the cornerstone of the show's critical success, has occasionally landed him in hot water. He regularly rants against the French, the Germans and the Millennium Dome. A particularly ill-advised tirade against travelling people brought a flood of complaints to Channel 4 - and Gypsy curses.",

      "bodyText": "France's fuel tax standoff escalated further yesterday as serious fissures began to appear in the ruling coalition and the European commission threatened legal action to maintain the free movement of goods. With some 80 % of the country's petrol stations either empty, under tight rationing or reserved for the emergency services, taxi drivers became the latest group to join the campaign for fuel tax cuts, causing traffic chaos in more than a dozen cities with massed \"go-slow\" protests. Farmers declared there was no prospect of them withdrawing from the barricades they are helping road hauliers to man outside 125 oil refineries and fuel depots around France. Dodging riot police, several hundred farmers succeeded in blocking the entrance to the Channel tunnel at Calais late yesterday afternoon, leading to angry confrontations with motorists. The blockade was later temporarily lifted to allow furious British holidaymakers on to the shuttle. Other farmers drove tractors and trailers on to train tracks outside Strasbourg and Bordeaux, bringing high-speed TGVs in the east and west to a standstill for most of the day. Nantes, Nice and Rennes airports reported they had all but run out of aviation fuel, school meals went undelivered in the Vosges, emergency-only petrol stations went dry in Brittany, and police were called in to guard requisitioned pumps in Lyons. For the first time in the four-day blockade, the French capital began to feel the pinch. While surrounding fuel depots were largely kept open by armed riot police, Paris petrol stations began to run out of fuel, particularly diesel, in increasing numbers. Furious at the fuel tax cuts already offered to the road hauliers, the Green party, a minority member of the Socialist-led coalition, warned the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, that it would react \"forcefully\" if any more concessions were made to road users. \"I back the cabinet that I am a member of, but I want to remind everyone that I joined it on the understanding that we would work for clean air and for moving away from road to rail transport,\" said the environment minister, Dominique Voynet. She had demanded an urgent meeting with Mr Jospin and said the Greens \"were not in this government in order to do the exact opposite of what we were elected to do\". Mr Jospin said on Wednesday night there would be no further negotiations with the hauliers and the government's offer was final. In Brussels, the European commission sent a formal request to Paris \"concerning a possible obstacle to the free movement of goods\", spokesman Jonathan Todd said.

The abolition of the fuel duty escalator took the wind out of the sails of the Tory leader William Hague. He had hoped to champion the interests of motorists but in the past few days he and his party have been remarkably quiet about the oil crisis. The Tories' relative silence shows higher fuel prices are unlikely to damage Labour at the next election. Governments of every hue levy exorbitant fuel duties and voters have rarely rebelled over the price of fuel, as the dismal response to the summer's Dump the Pump campaign showed. The stoicism of British voters means there will be no repeat of the kind of protests that are paralysing France. David Russell, of the Freight Transport Association, said his members would never take to the streets because direct action would alienate voters, destroying his group's leverage over the government. \"We do not behave like the French, although there are some elements who are interested in pursuing that line out of sheer frustration,\" Mr Russell said. The failure of British truckers - or most disaffected workers - to take to the streets highlights striking cultural differences between Britain and France, according to the Labour MP and foreign office aide, Denis Macshane. \"France has always been prone to sudden sharp mobilisations because there is not the tradition of debate that we have,\" he said. \"In Britain people also seem to have become inured to rises in petrol prices.\" While ministers may calculate that they will escape punishment over petrol price rises, there will be private alarm at the threat to the economy. The Treasury played down the dangers yesterday, declaring: \"We do not have alarm bells ringing.\" However, the doomsters warned that Britain will now move towards a recession. Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University, said: \"We have never before ridden out a trebling of oil prices without a slowing down of the world economy. Oil is the world's black magic.\"",

In a move reflecting the chancellor's determination to control policy on the single currency, Bill Morris, leader of the transport union, said the euro enthusiasts, who include TUC general secretary John Monks, were \"running down the pound\" and \"preaching doom and gloom\". In an interview with the New Statesman magazine ahead of the TUC conference in Glasgow, Mr Morris insisted it should be the government that ought to \"lead the debate on the euro\", and he ridiculed claims that millions of British jobs could be lost by staying out of the single currency. The chancellor has appointed Mr Morris to the court of the Bank of England, and, as if to emphasise the closeness of his view to those of the chancellor's, Mr Morris also published a Mori opinion poll showing a 10% net increase in the proportion of those prepared to back entry by Britain if the five convergence tests stipulated by Mr Brown were met. Mr Morris's curtain raiser for the TUC euro debate next week - the chancellor will address the congress on Tuesday - was made as it emerged that Tony Blair has agreed to a formal structure of regular Downing Street meetings with the TUC for the first time since Labour returned to office. In a sign of warming relations after what Mr Monks described as a \"productive but patchy\" first three years, there will be an official quarterly meeting between the two sides, backed with exchanges of position papers and a joint secretariat. The arrangements, which supersede present ad hoc contacts, will also bring in other ministers when necessary, and follow moves for a more systematic relationship between the TUC and the trade and industry department under Stephen Byers. But Mr Blair is still resistant to pressure from the unions to establish any broader tripartite \"social partnership\", bringing together government, unions and employers, as is common throughout the rest of the EU. Although there are what Mr Monks calls \"oases of tripartism\" in Britain (such as the low pay commission and the health and safety executive) the government is reluctant to raise the spectre of 1970s-style corporatism as practiced by previous governments, though the TUC argues that use of such bodies can avoid the damage caused by \"parallel lobbying\" by unions and employers. Mr Monks yesterday pointed to a \"surge\" of recognition agreements with employers as evidence that \"unions now find themselves in the most favourable political and economic context for more than 30 years\", although membership growth has been hit by job losses in manufacturing. He also said that the TUC would press the Labour party to adopt three policies in particular for the next parliament. It wants a legal obligation on employers to provide training for workers, the provision of company information and consultation rights for British workers, and complete protection of the terms and conditions of public sector employees whose work is transferred to the private sector.",

Its Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion.</p> <p>\"The state ranks near the top in the nation in rates of Aids, diabetes, tuberculosis and teenage pregnancy, and near the bottom in immunisations, mammograms and access to physicians.\"</p> <p>The article went on to point out that Texas's health record is a deeper problem than be laid at the door of any one politician, but it also explained that Bush has not tried to tackle it.</p> <p>Health has never been one of Bush's priority issues as governor. Though Bush makes much of his positive approach to Texas's Latino population, the health situation is worst in the state's most heavily Latino counties along the Mexican border - with disease rates \"at third world levels,\" Clymer wrote.</p> <p>It was hardly surprising that Clymer's article angered the Bush campaign, because it had a story to tell and because it highlighted an area of public policy of which Bush has a weak grasp.</p> <p>While Bush is confident when he deals with subjects like education and defence, he is noticeably less chipper on health issues.</p> <p>For much of the past 10 days, the Republican camp has been on the defensive about health policy, ever since Bush launched a campaign ad that claimed he would support extending a prescription drug benefit to retired Americans who are covered by the federal government's Medicare programme.</p> <p>How will it work and how much will it cost, Al Gore responded?

One school of thought says that the overheard remarks show the real Bush, supposedly a much nastier fellow than the chirpy grin merchant with whom we are now so familiar. Another says, maybe so, but the remarks will do Bush nothing but good, since they provide proof that there is lead in his pencil. What the reporting has missed, though, is why Bush should have been moved to make his comments.

Its Mexican border is a hotbed of contagion. \"The state ranks near the top in the nation in rates of Aids, diabetes, tuberculosis and teenage pregnancy, and near the bottom in immunisations, mammograms and access to physicians.\" The article went on to point out that Texas's health record is a deeper problem than be laid at the door of any one politician, but it also explained that Bush has not tried to tackle it. Health has never been one of Bush's priority issues as governor. Though Bush makes much of his positive approach to Texas's Latino population, the health situation is worst in the state's most heavily Latino counties along the Mexican border - with disease rates \"at third world levels,\" Clymer wrote. It was hardly surprising that Clymer's article angered the Bush campaign, because it had a story to tell and because it highlighted an area of public policy of which Bush has a weak grasp. While Bush is confident when he deals with subjects like education and defence, he is noticeably less chipper on health issues. For much of the past 10 days, the Republican camp has been on the defensive about health policy, ever since Bush launched a campaign ad that claimed he would support extending a prescription drug benefit to retired Americans who are covered by the federal government's Medicare programme. How will it work and how much will it cost, Al Gore responded? Bush had to confess that he didn't know and that he was working on the details. In Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Bush finally filled in the gaps, announcing a $158bn programme (Gore would spend $253bn). But it had been a damaging week, knocking Bush off his own agenda. No wonder that the Democrats have despatched Joe Lieberman into enemy territory this morning to make a speech in Houston on Bush's health care record. Seen in this context, Bush's outburst against Clymer can be viewed as more than just another politician randomly abusing another journalist. It becomes a more specific and more significant story, of a journalist who has angered a politician by exposing his weakness on an issue that could make or break his presidential bid. In those circumstances, Bush's language was surprisingly restrained. Special report: the US elections",

      "bodyText": "Arab weddings are splendid occasions, often spread over several days. They are also horrendously expensive. In a culture where appearances are important and generosity is a much-prized virtue, lavish feasts, extravagant parties and high-priced wedding dresses have become the norm. Some families even take out the equivalent of a mortgage to pay for it. The groom is also expected to provide a dowry for his bride, which in some countries can be almost prohibitive, though in others it may just be a token amount. The cost of a typical wedding ranges from $10,000 or so in Jordan to $50,000 or more in the Gulf - four or five years' wages for someone on an average salary. For many young Arabs the solution is to delay their marriage: men seek work abroad to earn more money, though it can still take 10 years or so to save enough for the big day. The result is that Arabs are marrying later and later. In Jordan, 60 per cent of men aged 25-30 are unmarried. Women who reach the age of 30 without marrying risk being regarded as unusa - permanently unmarriable spinsters. This conflicts with the precepts of Islam, which regards marriage as a religious duty and encourages people to marry early to minimise the temptations of pre-marital sex. Arab society expects brides to be virgins and loss of virginity is a serious matter which, in some of the more traditional communities, can result in a young woman being killed by her father or brothers to protect their family's \"honour.\" These difficulties have led to a new phenomenon in the Middle East: the growth of Islamic charities which organise and pay for collective weddings, and even provide a suitable marriage partner if necessary. Last Monday, Syria had its first experience of a collective wedding when 10 couples married at Qatana, near Damascus. A second wedding - scheduled for Valentine's Day next year - will knot together 50 couples. Other collective weddings have been held in Jordan, Egypt and Yemen. Besides providing a party for 350 guests, the charity gave each couple almost \u00a3800 in cash and presents donated by individuals and businesses in the area. For the donors, these gifts count as zakat - the 2.5 per cent of disposable income that Muslims are required to donate to charity each year. The work of a Jordanian marriage-promotion charity called al-Afaf (Arabic for \"chastity\") is described in the latest issue of Third World Quarterly. By last year it had organised six collective weddings, some of them very large. At one, Pepsi donated 2,000 cans of drinks and a local bakery provided 3,000 slices of cake. The parties are organised according to \"authentic Islamic customs and morals\" - which means that men and women are kept apart, and Koranic verses are recited continuously. One wedding last year had six different bands, though the music was suitably religious. Part of al-Afaf's aim is to demonstrate to other couples that weddings need not be ostentatious, socially-competitive and financially ruinous events. The charity also acts as guarantor on interest-free bank loans, mainly for hard-up young men who would otherwise be unable to marry. To qualify, a borrower must prove that he intends to marry and that the money will be used for wedding expenses. Over four years, the scheme has provided 791 loans totalling more than $571,000 and very few borrowers have defaulted on the repayments. In one case, a young man from a wealthy family was given a loan when his family threatened to cut him off because they disapproved of the woman he was planning to marry. The charity felt that, without financial help, he might end up unhappily married or not married at all. Al-Afaf also runs a free matchmaking service. Applicants of both sexes fill in a detailed questionnaire that is examined by a committee consisting entirely of women. This satisfies a social and religious requirement that no man will see a woman's application. The committee then informs male applicants of any suitable woman. At that stage, the Arab tradition for arranged marriages takes over. The man sends a female relative to the woman's house to announce his interest. If the proposal is accepted, the male heads of the each household meet to discuss terms, such as the amount of the dowry. Representatives of the charity can be called in to help if negotiations run into trouble. Although al-Afaf's motives are basically religious, it recognises that young people are more likely to be driven to use its services by financial hardship or the difficulty of finding a marriage partner in a society where the sexes are kept apart as much as possible. The loans and marriage-broking facilities have proved more popular than the collective weddings which some couples suspect will be used to draw them into Islamic religious organisations. But al-Afaf does not seem to mind and points out that its services are available to Christians too. It argues that promoting marriage benefits society generally and discourages \"western\" alternative lifestyles. brian.whitaker@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The Prince of Wales added his voice to the growing chorus of dome critics yesterday when he took a swipe at the beleaguered structure by insisting a visit to Buckingham Palace was a better day out. Members of the public looked on in amazement as the prince, who had joined them during an official visit to Buckingham Palace, said: \"It's better than going to the dome.\" Some of the 5,600 people who take the tour each day during the summer opening did double takes as they saw the prince, accompanied by his private protection officers, wandering through the state rooms. The prince, who was on an official visit to the palace as chairman of the Trustees of the Royal Collection Trust, appeared to be significantly more impressed by his own family's visitor attraction than the one in Greenwich despite having never visited the dome. He raised his eyebrows after being informed by staff at the palace that a tour there was a much cheaper option - \u00a322.50 for a family ticket compared with \u00a357. Well known for his outspoken views attacking modern architecture, the prince has been reported as saying he does not approve of the Greenwich attraction. He was in Edinburgh on the millennium eve when the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Tony and Cherie Blair attended the official opening. A St James's Palace spokeswoman said the prince had never made any public statement on the dome.",

Gone was the traditional Conservative party fanfare Land and Hope of Glory and in its place the strains of Man Next Door by Massive Attack boomed from the speakers. To the party's image consultants it must have seemed the perfect combination for the modern Conservatives: the sound of urban Britain combined with a homely theme. There was just one problem - the band abhors everything the party stands for and yesterday announced that they would be consulting their lawyers. \"Massive Attack have not and will never support the Conservative party or their policies,\" the Bristol-based dance band said. \"If our music has been used by the Tories it is without our knowledge or our permission. The misappropriation of our music by any organisation or broadcaster will be dealt with in the strongest way we can.\" A spokesman for the band's management company said: \"The Tories couldn't have picked a worse band politically. Massive's political leanings are far more to the left than Hague, although I'm not sure they would give permission to any political party to use their music. Last night Conservative central office was keen to play down the incident. \"It's a massive attack over nothing,\" said a spokesman. \"The music was for background and was not intended for broadcast.\" The spokesman was unable to comment on whether Mr Hague is a fan of the band but said it was popular among staff at Smith Square.",

The council rushed through a six-step programme after suffering the embarrassment of seeing 500 of its peacekeeping force taken hostage by ramshackle rebel forces in Sierra Leone this year. The speed of the UN response is a sign of the extent to which the organisation's image has been battered by a decade of disastrous operations. At a 90-minute meeting, the 15-member security council backed the plan. Attending were representatives of the five permanent members: the US president, Bill Clinton, the British prime minister, Tony Blair, the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the French president, Jacques Chirac. In a lengthy declaration published at the end of the meeting, the council pledged \"to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in addressing conflict at all stages, from prevention to settlement to post-conflict peace-building\". In an early test of its new resolve, it also issued a separate statement condemning the African countries involved in the fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The UN has begun organising a peacekeeping force for Congo but last night the security council reiterated that the troops will not be committed until the countries involved in the conflict abide by the ceasefire agreed in Lusaka last year. The reform of the peacekeeping operations was recommended in a report by a UN panel of experts a fortnight ago after investigations into why the UN had performed so badly in Rwanda and the Balkans.

      "body": "<p>Armed police used stun grenades to free eight illegal immigrants believed to have been held hostage by a Chinese \"Snakehead\" gang in the largest anti-kidnap operation ever mounted in the UK.</p> <p>Seven women and one man were freed during the raid on a house in Poplar, east London, on Wednesday afternoon. Two women were discovered crammed into a tiny cupboard space measuring 2ft by 1ft behind a false wall in the two-bedroom maisonette.</p> <p>The women, who, along with the rest of the victims had been held captive for at least 10 days, were distressed and received medical attention.</p> <p>The other hostages were said to be shaken but in relatively good health given the length of their ordeal and the strain of being held against their will. All eight have been taken to a secret address under police protection and will be questioned by immigration officials tomorrow.</p> <p>Thirteen people found in the flat were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and false imprisonment and were being questioned last night at three central London police stations. Another person arrested at the scene, a juvenile, was released from custody yesterday.</p> <p>A police source said the abductions appeared to be an \"archetypal snakehead kidnap\". The gangs specialise in trafficking illegal immigrants into the UK using extensive smuggling networks.</p> <p>Police were alerted when one of the hostages, a man in his early 20s, escaped from the house on Byng Street in the Isle of Dogs on Monday morning. He was found in a distressed state by a taxi driver who took him to a local police station.</p> <p>Officers from Scotland Yard's kidnap and specialist investigations unit mounted a 24-hour surveillance operation to locate the remaining captives. More than 100 officers were involved in the operation over three days.</p> <p>Shortly before 1pm on Wednesday, officers from the specialist firearms unit fired stun grenades through the front window of the maisonette. A small explosive charge was then fired to remove the lock on the front door and officers stormed the flat.</p> <p>There was no resistance from the suspects although a replica firearm was found in the flat.</p> <p>An eyewitness, Sharon Hurley, 39, who runs a mobile snack business near the flat, described seeing armed officers dressed in black and wearing gas masks storm the flat. \"We heard a series of loud bangs right on 1pm and all wondered 'what the hell was that',\" she said.</p> <p>\"Then we saw all hell breaking loose outside the flat. There were at least four or five armed police dressed all in black, over half a dozen police vans and two ambulances in the street. The officers were carrying rifles or machine guns. They told us later that the bangs we heard were stun grenades.\"</p> <p>All 22 people in the flat, some of whom were dressed only in underwear, were marched on to the street, searched, photographed and then clothed in white boiler suits before being driven away for questioning.</p> <p>Human traffickers charge up to \u00a320,000 to organise passage from China and the majority of the money is paid when the illegal immigrants reach the UK. The majority of Chinese illegal immigrants come from Fujian province, a largely agricultural area.</p> <p>Last month four men were arrested and charged with kidnapping and false imprisonment after a police raid at an address on the Thamesmead estate in Greenwich on the opposite bank of the Thames.</p> <p>Figures released by the national criminal intelligence service (NCIS) show an increase in incidents of kidnapping and extortion involving Chinese-organised gangs in the last year. The number of kidnaps in the UK rose from 41 in 1998 to 72 last year.</p> <p>An NCIS source said there were typically three scenarios in kidnap cases: \"Groups of illegal immigrants smuggled into the country by one gang may be kidnapped by a rival gang and money demanded; they may be taken hostage by the people they payed to smuggle them into the country; or they may be kidnapped after falling behind on payments.\"</p> <p>Jabez Lam, a Chinese community activist, said economic hardship and political repression were behind the increasing numbers of immigrants.</p> <p>\"Unemployment is rising fast in China and it forces people into increasingly desperate choices. These people sometimes leave children and family behind in order to try and make money abroad to support them.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Armed police used stun grenades to free eight illegal immigrants believed to have been held hostage by a Chinese \"Snakehead\" gang in the largest anti-kidnap operation ever mounted in the UK. Seven women and one man were freed during the raid on a house in Poplar, east London, on Wednesday afternoon. Two women were discovered crammed into a tiny cupboard space measuring 2ft by 1ft behind a false wall in the two-bedroom maisonette. The women, who, along with the rest of the victims had been held captive for at least 10 days, were distressed and received medical attention. The other hostages were said to be shaken but in relatively good health given the length of their ordeal and the strain of being held against their will. All eight have been taken to a secret address under police protection and will be questioned by immigration officials tomorrow. Thirteen people found in the flat were arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and false imprisonment and were being questioned last night at three central London police stations. Another person arrested at the scene, a juvenile, was released from custody yesterday. A police source said the abductions appeared to be an \"archetypal snakehead kidnap\". The gangs specialise in trafficking illegal immigrants into the UK using extensive smuggling networks. Police were alerted when one of the hostages, a man in his early 20s, escaped from the house on Byng Street in the Isle of Dogs on Monday morning. He was found in a distressed state by a taxi driver who took him to a local police station. Officers from Scotland Yard's kidnap and specialist investigations unit mounted a 24-hour surveillance operation to locate the remaining captives. More than 100 officers were involved in the operation over three days. Shortly before 1pm on Wednesday, officers from the specialist firearms unit fired stun grenades through the front window of the maisonette. A small explosive charge was then fired to remove the lock on the front door and officers stormed the flat. There was no resistance from the suspects although a replica firearm was found in the flat. An eyewitness, Sharon Hurley, 39, who runs a mobile snack business near the flat, described seeing armed officers dressed in black and wearing gas masks storm the flat. \"We heard a series of loud bangs right on 1pm and all wondered 'what the hell was that',\" she said. \"Then we saw all hell breaking loose outside the flat. There were at least four or five armed police dressed all in black, over half a dozen police vans and two ambulances in the street. The officers were carrying rifles or machine guns. They told us later that the bangs we heard were stun grenades.\" All 22 people in the flat, some of whom were dressed only in underwear, were marched on to the street, searched, photographed and then clothed in white boiler suits before being driven away for questioning. Human traffickers charge up to \u00a320,000 to organise passage from China and the majority of the money is paid when the illegal immigrants reach the UK. The majority of Chinese illegal immigrants come from Fujian province, a largely agricultural area. Last month four men were arrested and charged with kidnapping and false imprisonment after a police raid at an address on the Thamesmead estate in Greenwich on the opposite bank of the Thames. Figures released by the national criminal intelligence service (NCIS) show an increase in incidents of kidnapping and extortion involving Chinese-organised gangs in the last year. The number of kidnaps in the UK rose from 41 in 1998 to 72 last year. An NCIS source said there were typically three scenarios in kidnap cases: \"Groups of illegal immigrants smuggled into the country by one gang may be kidnapped by a rival gang and money demanded; they may be taken hostage by the people they payed to smuggle them into the country; or they may be kidnapped after falling behind on payments.\" Jabez Lam, a Chinese community activist, said economic hardship and political repression were behind the increasing numbers of immigrants. \"Unemployment is rising fast in China and it forces people into increasingly desperate choices. These people sometimes leave children and family behind in order to try and make money abroad to support them.\"",

But all that involves is adding 1% to the current figure of 74.6% (of working age population in work). At the moment, only half of lone parents, 46% of disabled people, two-thirds of men over 50 and two-thirds of people from ethnic minorities are in work. What if they became targets for \"full employment\"? The table offers some targets. 1 is getting parents with children aged 5+ into jobs; 2 is halving the current difference between employment for disabled and non-disabled people; 3 is getting men aged 50+ into at the same rate as in the late 70s; 4 is raising employment among ethnic minority people of working age to the same level as whites.

The doctors want to save one child at the expense of the other, the parents don't. How everyone has relished the moral, ethical and legal dilemmas.

Only the extraordinary personal anguish expressed by the judges themselves reminds us of the human horror at the centre of it all.</p> <p>The big beasts of medical ethics have been locking horns, the rationalists against the religious as usual. The parents are represented as simple deeply religious Catholics from a faraway rural community who want to leave things to \"God's will\". They ask: \"Why should we kill one of our daughters to enable the other to survive?\" Supported by the Pro-Life Alliance, they have been offered a safe haven in Italy by a Roman Catholic cardinal to escape the murderous knives of British medicine.</p> <p>The (somewhat Jesuitical) Catholic doctrine of double effect says that the intention is what counts: if doctors thought there was a shred of a chance of saving Mary's life then her subsequent unfortunate death would be acceptable, but she cannot be deliberately murdered to save her sister. It is never right to do a bad thing for a greater good. (No, put aside all thoughts on the history of the Vatican.) Catholic theologians say death is unimportant, a transition to the next life, so saving every life in every situation is not a priority. Given the great lengths they will go to to save an unborn life against a mother's will, it seems odd. But that's their position. Jodie's death is preferable to Mary's murder.</p> <p>In the other corner, upholding the first judge, are the rationalists. Dame Mary Warnock has pronounced. It's a simple matter. Either one or both dies, which is best? Easy. Professional philosophers take us through a lively set of hypotheticals displaying the criteria needed to reach that position through a sifting of the options.</p> <p>Professor Bernard Williams, the celebrated ethicist offers these: 1) The spelunker case: a fat man is jammed in the only exit to a pothole. Do the other cavers kill him to escape? Answer: yes, because it's an unavoidable emergency, a situation of no one's contriving. 2) The trolley case: a rail trolley is speeding towards a man strapped to the line, do you intervene to change the points and save him? Yes, of course. Ah, but what if there were five men strapped to the other line, would you let him die to save more lives? If you let him die, can he sue regardless of saving the other five? No, the decision is imposed on the man at the points, so in extremis numbers of lives saved must count.</p> <p>But that raises the cannibalisation case: if a healthy man walks into a hospital where three others are about to die for lack of his organs, do you kill him to save the others? No, you can't go arbitrarily redistributing lives but sometimes in emergencies you have to make the best of bad choices, in which case numbers of lives saved do count. So on that analysis, one live child is better than two dead. However, as Professor Williams himself says, in the real world things don't always look quite like his philosophy.</p> <p>Nothing in this case is clear-cut. The finicky arguments continue as to whether Mary exists as a legal entity - has she drawn breath or is she a growth? But it's emerging in court that the medical outcome for Jodie is far from clear. The twins are joined almost right down the front to the anus like a seamless cylinder with mingled bowels. If separated, Jodie might well be doubly incontinent and she might never walk. Her brain function might not be 100% either.</p> <p>The reason her parents should be allowed to make this decision themselves is that either way, they are the ones who will have to live forever with the outcome. They may have to care for a severely disabled child with very little help. Since they cannot live with the idea that one child has been murdered to save the other, they are likely to pass those feelings on to the child. So they must be free to decide, relieving the squeamish judges of their sleepless nights.</p> <p>Ah, say the rationalists, but wouldn't you intervene to save a Christian Science child dying of appendicitis or a Jehovah's Witness child in need of a blood transfusion? Parents are not always right and children do need to be protected from cranks. The extraordinary thing about these life and death medical ethics cases is that they knit a tangled web of contradictory principles. The right to life is a very flexible principle. Pro-lifers were passionately opposed to letting the vegetative patient Tony Bland die through having his feeding tube removed and yet they want to see these twins die. As for the rationalists, is it really so rational to strive to keep alive a frail baby in need of many painful operations against its parents' will on some semi-religious notion of the sanctity of life?</p> <p>Far too much effort goes into officiously keeping alive damaged specks of humanity as ground-breaking paediatricians save ever-younger foetuses. Last month the British Medical Journal reported that nearly half of very premature babies grow up with some kind of neurological disability: a quarter of babies born at 22-25 weeks are severely disabled - blind and unable to walk. The report highlighted the importance of telling parents the risk and letting them, not doctors or courts, make decisions about life-saving treatment.</p> <p>A study from the national perinatal epidemiology unit last month studied the high number of premature babies with cerebral palsy and the phenomenal cost not just to the NHS, but in their 50% greater chance of needing special schools and having life-long health problems and loss of family income, with increased family breakdown. Newspapers like stories of the smallest baby ever saved by the doctors, but there are no follow-ups after the home-from-hospital picture.</p> <p>The right to life is not an absolute. It is inextricably and untidily linked in almost every case with social and psychological considerations, as well as the money that might have bought more health and happiness elsewhere. For the courts to demand that parents must keep alive severely deformed children against their will is perverse and unkind. The Catholic arguments confuse the issue, but this time, for all the wrong reasons, the Pope is infallible.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

After last month's cliffhanging five-four decision in favour of \"no change,\" the committee was probably just as divided over the rate decision yesterday. There will still have been those worried that private sector spending is not slowing rapidly enough to allow room for Gordon Brown's generous public sector spending plans to kick in, while the doves on the committee will have been cheered by a decline in earnings growth and a further easing of the property boom.

It would have been inconsistent for it to have raised rates yesterday after a month of conflicting signals from the economy. Doing nothing yesterday might have been boring, but it was the right thing. Invensys sinks Those who believe mergers destroy as much value as they create will be adding Invensys - the tie-up between Siebe and BTR - to their textbook studies unless a turnaround is effected pretty sharpish. The company yesterday reported trading difficulties in many of its core areas and, ominously, in software, where it has just forked out \u00a3470m to take majority control of the troubled Dutch group Baan. Invensys' Canadian-born chief executive, Allen Yurko, blames an array of market difficulties - such as a slowdown in US residential building and a reduction in demand from the oil and gas sector as well as reductions in semi-conductor prices. Unsurprisingly, the City was sceptical of these claims pointing out that the US economy is booming, oil prices are rocketing and software sales are up everywhere.

But what value the merger of Siebe and BTR with the thousands of job losses and sales of businesses if it were not to make Invensys leaner, fitter and able to weather a storm? So the markets gave Mr Yurko a serious clout on the head yesterday. A 37% share price fall in a Footsie company in a single day is almost unheard of. One thing in particular which has stuck in the City's collective craw is the admission that software margins are being squeezed. Having sold off businesses such as automotive products, environmental technology and aerospace operations, Invernsys faces a real question over whether it really needed to move into software. If it was an attempt to bring a bit of e-glamour to a business rooted in the old economy, it has all gone horribly wrong. Stout surfeit Are the Irish finally falling out of love with the creamy black stuff? It appears so, according to Diageo, which yesterday revealed that sales of Guinness had fallen in the Emerald Isle for the first time. The 4% decline is hardly cause to sell shares in the world's biggest drinks company. But it does point to a longer-term trend - Diageo blamed Ireland's booming economic growth , which means \"people are doing other things, rather than just going to the pub\". The problem, for Diageo is that Guinness has traditionally been the drink of the working man in Ireland. It hardly ranks alongside vodka and Red Bull as a trendy tipple for young, urban Dubliners or for the legions of employees of the country's burgeoning hi-tech industry. In countries where Guinness has been introduced much more recently the drink is doing fine - because it is associated with Rutger Hauer's stylish marketing patter and with glossy advertisements showing horses bursting through waves. Such a renaissance could take a while in the drink's home territory, where Guinness will always be the devil's buttermilk first produced by Arthur Guinness in 1759.

The automation and controls specialist said trading activity had been \"below expectations\" with a downturn in a range of main markets such as US residential, oil and gas, and software systems. Reference to the computer sector particularly upset the City because Invensys has just completed an unpopular deal to take over troubled Dutch software group Baan where 1,000 jobs have already gone. Allen Yurko, chief executive of Invensys - the product of a merger between Siebe and BTR 18 months ago - plans to cut up to 3% of the group's total staff and shut several plants in the US and Mexico. He blamed some of the staff reductions on the dollar's strength against the euro and said only 300 jobs at most would go in Britain. But he admitted there were wider problems: \"The expected recovery in our capital goods markets has not materialised, with oil and gas expenditure down a further 3% year on year.

Who will ever forget the sheer, joyous, fan-bloody-tastic feeling of mind-blowing exhilaration we all felt on that bright, confident dawn of May 2 1997, after New Labour had swept to power?</p> <p>This is what I wrote at the time, as part of a text that is still studied in media courses around the land: \"After 18 long, hard years, the forces of good have triumphed, sleaze has been vanquished and this poor benighted country has been instantly transformed.</p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, no child need ever look plaintively up at a tree, unable to reach for that rosy apple.</p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, no senior citizen at a supermarket till need ever fumble for loose change in an old coat.</p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, no discontented youth need ever again perform an armed robbery on a sub-post office in order to be able to afford a brand new motor-scooter.</p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, there will be no greenhouse effect, no BSE, no negative equity, no traffic snarl-ups on the M25, no deaths from drunk-driving, no feuds in Northern Ireland, no toxic waste, no increased bank charges and no inner-city kiddies under- performing in their GCSEs.</p> <p>\"Under Tony Blair, Britain will be transformed into a land of hope and plenty, a land from which we will all be filled with a new glow of confidence to march into a golden future. Hail Tony! Hail New Labour! And welcome, my friends: welcome to tomorrow!\"</p> <p>Reading this text today, over three years on, I have every reason to feel disenchanted. I had slogged my guts out for a New Labour victory, often talking until the early hours in other people's houses of the great benefits Tony Blair would bring not just the ordinary, decent people of this country, but those of us involved in the London media, too.</p> <p>An end to parking restrictions on the north side of Upper Street. A revitalised ICA, with free access to early Tarkovsky movies to all people, regardless of race or creed, on the presentation of a birth certificate. An open invitation to dinner with Chris Smith for ongoing dialogue to encourage increased state funding for the arts. And - just as importantly - an end to disease, prejudice and poverty not only in the capital but in every city in Britain.</p> <p>And now what? Or - to put it another way, a way that conveys just a small part of my anger - and NOW BLOODY WHAT?</p> <p>For too long, I suffered in silence. When the Millennium Dome was built, I applauded it as a \"soaraway success story - a fitting emblem for a new kind of Britain: efficient, forward-looking, popular and, above all, supercool\". Why, I even found signs for optimism when hospital waiting lists grew longer. \"It all goes to show,\" I wrote, \"that never before has the NHS been so popular, so vibrant, and, perhaps above all, so supercool.\"</p> <p>But I can hold my tongue no longer.

      "bodyText": "My god, I thought it would be so different. All so very different. Who will ever forget the sheer, joyous, fan-bloody-tastic feeling of mind-blowing exhilaration we all felt on that bright, confident dawn of May 2 1997, after New Labour had swept to power? This is what I wrote at the time, as part of a text that is still studied in media courses around the land: \"After 18 long, hard years, the forces of good have triumphed, sleaze has been vanquished and this poor benighted country has been instantly transformed. \"Under Tony Blair, no child need ever look plaintively up at a tree, unable to reach for that rosy apple. \"Under Tony Blair, no senior citizen at a supermarket till need ever fumble for loose change in an old coat. \"Under Tony Blair, no discontented youth need ever again perform an armed robbery on a sub-post office in order to be able to afford a brand new motor-scooter. \"Under Tony Blair, there will be no greenhouse effect, no BSE, no negative equity, no traffic snarl-ups on the M25, no deaths from drunk-driving, no feuds in Northern Ireland, no toxic waste, no increased bank charges and no inner-city kiddies under- performing in their GCSEs. \"Under Tony Blair, Britain will be transformed into a land of hope and plenty, a land from which we will all be filled with a new glow of confidence to march into a golden future. Hail Tony! Hail New Labour! And welcome, my friends: welcome to tomorrow!\" Reading this text today, over three years on, I have every reason to feel disenchanted. I had slogged my guts out for a New Labour victory, often talking until the early hours in other people's houses of the great benefits Tony Blair would bring not just the ordinary, decent people of this country, but those of us involved in the London media, too. An end to parking restrictions on the north side of Upper Street. A revitalised ICA, with free access to early Tarkovsky movies to all people, regardless of race or creed, on the presentation of a birth certificate. An open invitation to dinner with Chris Smith for ongoing dialogue to encourage increased state funding for the arts. And - just as importantly - an end to disease, prejudice and poverty not only in the capital but in every city in Britain. And now what? Or - to put it another way, a way that conveys just a small part of my anger - and NOW BLOODY WHAT? For too long, I suffered in silence. When the Millennium Dome was built, I applauded it as a \"soaraway success story - a fitting emblem for a new kind of Britain: efficient, forward-looking, popular and, above all, supercool\". Why, I even found signs for optimism when hospital waiting lists grew longer. \"It all goes to show,\" I wrote, \"that never before has the NHS been so popular, so vibrant, and, perhaps above all, so supercool.\" But I can hold my tongue no longer. No longer can I hold my tongue. It is my tongue that can no longer be held by me. Mo Mowlam has announced her departure. She no longer feels like working with Blair, Put simply - and I write this with tears in my eyes - Mo is to go. I have known and loved Mo for more than a quarter of a century now, ever since we both sat around on beanbags setting the world to rights, smoking what we probably shouldn't have been smoking and all to the radical, thought-provoking, but above all caring, sound of Justin Hayward and the Moody Blues. I suppose it was when I first witnessed her performing a miracle - she fed a gathering of up to 5,000 on no more than a handful of loaves and fishes - that I first realised Mo was someone rather special.

The footage included sickening images of the dead and dying.</p> <p>Several families left the inquest to watch the three videos, lasting about 10 minutes, in a side room. Their wailing could be heard outside, and they said afterwards that the sounds of screaming on the footage were as upsetting as the gruesome pictures.</p> <p>Greater Belfast coroner John Leckey is presiding over the inquest into the deaths of 29 people, killed when a 500lb car bomb went off in the Co Tyrone town on August 15, 1998. It is expected to last four weeks, and yesterday was the second day of the hearing.</p> <p>Only a short clip of the first video to be shown yesterday has been screened on television news. None of the rest of the footage has been shown.</p> <p>Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan, 21, died in the explosion, said: \"I thought at first how could someone stand there and video a scene like that. Now I am glad they did. The opportunity should be given so everyone can see it, so that they can see the true horror of Omagh.\"</p> <p>Mario Radford, whose son Alan, 16, was also killed, said: \"When I saw the videos. I could not believe one human being could contemplate such destruction on another. It makes me angry these people are walking the streets. I have never felt anger or bitterness, but I do want justice.</p> <p>\"It was my solicitor who pointed Alan's body out to me. I was very near him. I don't know how I couldn't find him. I would probably have ended up in a mental hospital if I had.\"</p> <p>The first film to be shown depicted an injured girl, aged about 13, wandering in a daze close to the bomb scene. She was crying: \"Where's mummy? Where's mummy?\"</p> <p>The background sound of screaming was constant, and a badly injured woman, her face bloody, staggered about in shock. Her hands were raised and she constantly cried: \"Oh my God. Oh my God.\"</p> <p>As several people crouched over one victim, a man desperately instructed them on first aid. He said: \"Keep the pressure on it. Hold pressure on it. Hard. Keep pressure on it.\"</p> <p>One of the dead or injured was shown being carried away in a tattered red tarpaulin. A little girl was being helped to an ambulance.</p> <p>The second video had a commentary from the man filming it. He had an Australian accent. He said: \"You just would not believe this. You just would not believe what has fucking happened. The centre of the town had been wrecked by a fucking bomb two minutes again, less than that. You would not fucking believe it. So much for the fucking peace process.\"</p> <p>His video was filled with the sound of crunching glass underfoot. At one point a woman shouted: \"Somebody help me. Somebody help me.\"</p> <p>Mr Leckey said the video was important because it showed that a water mains had been ruptured. That hampered the rescue, because victims and body parts moved under the force of the water.</p> <p>In the third video there was a glimpse of the remains of a body, looking like a slab of raw meat. There was also a severed leg, partly covered in a bin-liner. In both cases, the operator quickly averted his camera.</p> <p>One woman was lying on the ground alongside another, comforting her. The victim was motionless.</p> <p>The camera swept along a bus used to ferry the injured to hospital. They had a catalogue of bloody injuries, and were in shock. One girl, her back terribly ripped, was supported by two friends. She lolled as if unconscious.</p> <p>One man said: \"Look for bodies. Keep your eyes going.\" Another muttered: \"They were only doing their shopping.\" A third said: \"Terrible. Terrible.\"</p> <p>Patsy McElhatton, 59, a member of the Fintona cycling club, shot one of the videos, believed to be the third.

      "bodyText": "Relatives of the 29 people killed in the Omagh atrocity broke down and wept yesterday as they watched for the first time horrifying amateur videos shot immediately after the Real IRA car bomb blast. The footage included sickening images of the dead and dying. Several families left the inquest to watch the three videos, lasting about 10 minutes, in a side room. Their wailing could be heard outside, and they said afterwards that the sounds of screaming on the footage were as upsetting as the gruesome pictures. Greater Belfast coroner John Leckey is presiding over the inquest into the deaths of 29 people, killed when a 500lb car bomb went off in the Co Tyrone town on August 15, 1998. It is expected to last four weeks, and yesterday was the second day of the hearing. Only a short clip of the first video to be shown yesterday has been screened on television news. None of the rest of the footage has been shown. Michael Gallagher, whose son Aidan, 21, died in the explosion, said: \"I thought at first how could someone stand there and video a scene like that. Now I am glad they did. The opportunity should be given so everyone can see it, so that they can see the true horror of Omagh.\" Mario Radford, whose son Alan, 16, was also killed, said: \"When I saw the videos. I could not believe one human being could contemplate such destruction on another. It makes me angry these people are walking the streets. I have never felt anger or bitterness, but I do want justice. \"It was my solicitor who pointed Alan's body out to me. I was very near him. I don't know how I couldn't find him. I would probably have ended up in a mental hospital if I had.\" The first film to be shown depicted an injured girl, aged about 13, wandering in a daze close to the bomb scene. She was crying: \"Where's mummy? Where's mummy?\" The background sound of screaming was constant, and a badly injured woman, her face bloody, staggered about in shock. Her hands were raised and she constantly cried: \"Oh my God. Oh my God.\" As several people crouched over one victim, a man desperately instructed them on first aid. He said: \"Keep the pressure on it. Hold pressure on it. Hard. Keep pressure on it.\" One of the dead or injured was shown being carried away in a tattered red tarpaulin. A little girl was being helped to an ambulance. The second video had a commentary from the man filming it. He had an Australian accent. He said: \"You just would not believe this. You just would not believe what has fucking happened. The centre of the town had been wrecked by a fucking bomb two minutes again, less than that. You would not fucking believe it. So much for the fucking peace process.\" His video was filled with the sound of crunching glass underfoot. At one point a woman shouted: \"Somebody help me. Somebody help me.\" Mr Leckey said the video was important because it showed that a water mains had been ruptured. That hampered the rescue, because victims and body parts moved under the force of the water. In the third video there was a glimpse of the remains of a body, looking like a slab of raw meat. There was also a severed leg, partly covered in a bin-liner. In both cases, the operator quickly averted his camera. One woman was lying on the ground alongside another, comforting her. The victim was motionless. The camera swept along a bus used to ferry the injured to hospital. They had a catalogue of bloody injuries, and were in shock. One girl, her back terribly ripped, was supported by two friends. She lolled as if unconscious. One man said: \"Look for bodies. Keep your eyes going.\" Another muttered: \"They were only doing their shopping.\" A third said: \"Terrible. Terrible.\" Patsy McElhatton, 59, a member of the Fintona cycling club, shot one of the videos, believed to be the third. He had his camera with him because of a club event. Mr McElhatton said outside the inquest: \"I was down at the scene less than four minutes after it went off. I knew a lot of people there, and, as I was filming, I was wondering why am I doing this? But I thought at least this will be shown around the world, and people will know what a bomb can do.\" He had handed the video to police, after considering getting rid of it. Mr McElhatton said: \"The full horror of it all only hit me seven weeks ago. I won't walk down that street anymore. I wish I was never there, to tell you the truth.\" The Police Federation in Northern Ireland announced it was appointing counsel to represent all of its members appearing at the inquiry. The move follows tough questioning of police witnesses over their reactions to the three confused bomb warnings, and has divided the families. Michael Mansfield QC, appearing for Lawrence Rush, widower of Libby, 57, and Barry Fox, an Omagh solicitor representing the families of victims Esther Gibson, 36, and Avril Monaghan, 30, and her daughter Maura, 18 months, have led the probing. They are focusing on police procedures. Ken Duncan, a solicitor for the family of Deborah Anne Cartwright, 20, who also died, objected. He wanted the questioning halted until the officers' legal teams arrived, and, after debate, the video evidence was taken. Mr Leckey will rule this morning on whether he will subpoena Francie Mackey, the Omagh-based chairman of the 32-County Sovereignty Movement. It is believed to be linked to the Real IRA.",

Mr Clinton held separate discussions with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, on the fringes of the summit. The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said he could report no progress on the contentious issue of control of Jerusalem and that no further meetings were planned. Time is running out for Mr Clinton, with the US presidential election only two months away and Mr Barak's coalition government facing collapse next month. More pressing, Mr Arafat and his colleagues will meet this weekend to decide whether unilaterally to declare Palestinian independence on September 13, as they had threatened unless a deal was in place. The Palestinian delegation said the declaration could be delayed. Mr Clinton had been desperate to secure a Middle East settlement as the main legacy of his presidency. He met Mr Barak and Mr Arafat on the upper floor of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in an attempt to see if there was a compromise that would complete the deal almost secured in July at Camp David. But White House officials said the positions had slipped back since then. Mr Arafat, in his speech to the millennium summit, took an uncompromising stance, declaring that Palestine should have sovereignty over Arab east Jerusalem, ditching the possibility of a compromise that might have seen the city share sovereignty or come under international control. Mr Arafat told the summit that the Palestinians had already made painful sacrifices for peace. An Israeli official said nothing could happen in the peace negotiations until Mr Arafat demonstrated he was ready to discuss ideas offered at or since Camp David. The public mood in Israel swung from anticipation to gloom yesterday after President Clinton failed to break the deadlock. The acting foreign minister, Shlomo Ben Ami, warned against over-optimism at the prospects of reaching a peace agreement while Mr Clinton remains in power. The mood darkened perceptibly as Israeli negotiators said there was no further room for manoeuvre with the Palestinians.\" We cannot be more flexible in our stances regarding Jerusalem,\" Gilead Sher, a negotiator, told Israel's army radio. Although the focus of negotiations since the collapse of the Camp David summit in July has been the status of Jerusalem, Mr Ben Ami emphasised that there were wide gaps between the two sides on refugees, as well as on less contentious issues like borders and settlements. \"We should not make the mistake of thinking that some symbolic compromise that Arafat agrees to on the Temple Mount solves the rest of the problems,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations proudly subscribes to the principle that all nations and all people are equal. But that maxim took a knock yesterday when it published the official picture of the world leaders attending the millennium summit in New York. The UN recognises 189 countries and here were most of them. Only 14 of the world leaders attending the summit were missing. It was an opportunity to demonstrate a new look for the 21st century, a happy mix of nations, an informal huddle, free of status. Instead, the old order was reaffirmed. The developing nations were pushed to the back as the western leaders took pride of place. The US president, Bill Clinton, was near the centre, with Tony Blair, close by. The Cuban leader, Fidel Castro managed to squeeze into the second row. Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, was pushed all the way to the back row. A spokeswoman for the UN protocol department insisted there was a logic behind the positioning. She said the secretary-general, Kofi Annan, had been placed in the centre, with the two co-chairmen of the summit flanking him, and then the permanent members of the security council. After that the order was decided alphabetically by country, beginning with heads of state, then heads of government, and then deputies. The protocol was disrupted by some who were too infirm to climb to the back and by the inclusion of interlopers. The picture was meant to have only one representative from each country but Jordan and Norway had two on show. So too did San Marino, but in its case it was justified as it has joint leadership, two captain regents of equal standing.",

      "bodyText": "Governors of a south Wales primary school voted last night to maintain the year-old suspension of Marjorie Evans, the headteacher cleared last week of slapping an unruly 10-year-old pupil across the face. The decision followed an hour-and-a-half meeting at the school which is at the centre of a separate police investigation into allegations of inappropriate emotional and physical handling of pupils. The National Union of Teachers, which has supported Mrs Evans throughout her suspension, said it was extremely disappointed at the governors' conclusion and complained that the appropriate procedures had not been followed before the suspension was renewed at the beginning of this month. Graham Powell, the chairman of governors who has been a strong supporter of Mrs Evans's reinstatement, said the decision had been taken following the advice of Monmouthshire county council's legal and education department. He said a further meeting would be held on September 28. In a statement after the meeting, he said \"The governors wish to emphasise that the suspension is not a disciplinary step and is without prejudice.\" Mrs Evans, 56, has been suspended since September last year when the 10-year-old special needs pupil accused her of slapping him when he became difficult after being told he could not go swimming with his classmates because of previous bad behaviour. Neither the boy nor the school can be identified for legal reasons. Governors decided last week to maintain the suspension in the light of the continuing inquiry by Gwent police despite Mrs Evans' successful appeal against a conviction for common assault following a trial at Abergavenny magistrates court in July. A judge at Cardiff crown court told her she left the court with her good character entirely intact. Mrs Evans's supporters have complained that she has become the victim of a witch-hunt by a small group of parents and staff seeking to remove her from the school. Gwent police, whose handling of the new investigation has come under fierce criticism, have refused to comment on the nature of the alleged mistreatment of children at the 210-pupil school. One mother has expressed concern that her children had become \"pawns\" in the affair even though she had made no complaints against Mrs Evans or another teacher, Janet Bowen, who has been suspended in connection with the inquiry. Mr Powell confirmed last night that the police had not informed him of the allegations or by whom they had been made. NUT spokesman Gethin Lewis called for a meeting to hear the nature of the allegations. In a statement Mrs Evans said she was disappointed that the governing body had not decided to lift her suspension. \"At no time have the police interviewed me regarding the further allegations, nor have these allegations been put to me.

      "bodyText": "From the outside, Joan Stock's neat, white bungalow in the village of Saltford on the outskirts of Bristol looks like the ideal retirement home. Step inside, however, and you enter something of a technological time warp. Instead of a colour television and video, a 12-inch black and white portable sits incongruously on a stand designed for something much bigger. The telephones belong to an earlier era. Even the washing machine and tumble drier have long been overtaken by advances in white goods technology. The lack of modern conveniences does not reflect an unusual form of asceticism. Nor is it due to parsimony, but to a rare hypersensitivity to microchips that has made Mrs Stock's life a misery for more than 25 years. Mrs Stock says that if she goes near a computer or sits in a modern motor car she quickly begins to suffer with a pain that she likens to a pencil boring through the back of her head. \"I have earache and toothache and my vision goes distorted. It is just as though you are drunk and you don't know what you are doing,\" she said yesterday. \"I find it very scary, especially when the eyes go. They can be like that for hours and I worry that they may not become all right again. The pains in my head can last for days.\" Mrs Stock, a sprightly 79, says that she first noticed the problem in the mid-1970s when an electronic typewriter was introduced to the office where she worked as a secretary for the old Wessex water authority. But life has become increasingly problematic as the years have progressed because of the widespread use of microchips in everyday items. Supermarket checkouts have become a no-go area; modern telephones with their number storage facilities are out of the question; and even a trip to a favourite local pub is no longer a possibility since they installed electronic bar equipment. Mrs Stock's problem has been attributed to a rare sensitivity to electromagnetic fields of a particular frequency given out by some modern electronic goods. According to David Dowson, a specialist in complementary and environmental medicine to whom she turned for help several years ago, her condition is extremely rare. He said he had only come across eight similar cases in 15 years, but although people often dismissed the problem as psychological, it was not. \"Avoidance is the best answer,\" he said yesterday. \"I have one patient who has moved to the middle of Dartmoor.\" Mrs Stock, a great-grand mother who spends much of her time reading and listening to the radio, says her own GP has been very understanding. \"He doesn't know what to do for me, but he has been very kind and when I do have to go and see him about something he gives me the last appointment so he can switch the computer off in the surgery.\" The biggest disappointment Mrs Stock and her husband Roy face lies in the restriction that her sensitivity to 21st century life has placed on their activities. They are unable to travel by public transport, making foreign holidays an impossibility, and have even had to stop going to the theatre because of computerised tills and lighting systems. Mr Stock, a retired solicitor who served with the RAF during the second world war, drives an Escort which he bought secondhand almost 15 years ago. He would like to buy a newer car but knows it could be packed full of electronic gadgetry. At the same time he is worried about breakdowns in case his wife has to travel home in a modern vehicle. It is a concern she shares. Mrs Stock added: \"When I am out in the open air there is no problem - it is in confined spaces, such as houses, shops and cars. \"My biggest regret is not being able to go and visit people. I'm a sociable person and there are lots of things I would like to do. \"But my friends and family know I'm not potty and have been very supportive.

      "bodyText": "The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund last night sought to defuse growing protests at the sluggish pace of international debt relief efforts, with a pledge to give help to 20 of the world's poorest countries by the end of the year. With the IMF's new managing director, Horst Kohler, set for a confrontation with debt campaigners and charities at a lunch hosted by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, today, the Fund and the Bank issued a joint statement promising to end the delays and bottlenecks. Western leaders committed themselves a year ago to giving 24 countries debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative by the end of 2000, but with less than four months to go only 10 have received any assistance. Debt campaigners have blamed the two international financial institutions for dragging their feet on debt relief, accusing them of ring-fencing debt relief with new time-consuming conditions which poor countries must fulfil. Although the fund and the bank deny that they have been erecting fresh road blocks to debt relief, they have been coming under pressure from politicians including Mr Brown and the development secretary, Clare Short, to accelerate the process. \"We are doing everything possible to achieve speedy implementation of the HIPC initiative,\" said Mr Kohler and the World Bank president, James Wolfensohn, in a joint statement. The IMF and World Bank have agreed to show greater flexibility when assessing the economic track records of poor countries applying for debt relief - a move which they say will increase the number of countries eligible for debt relief this year from 20 to 24. The move comes as the World Bank and IMF are bracing themselves for mass protests at their annual meetings in Prague later this month, at which the slow progress on debt relief will be one of the contentious issues.

From October, Safeway's like-for-like sales comparatives start to get tough which means there will be a risk that its January trading statement will disappoint.",

At Merrill Lynch, one of the top tier American banks, new graduates are given signing-on bonuses of \u00a36,500 and a yearly basic salary of \u00a337,500.

The architect was there, on the lookout too, presumably. Discovering that I had no couchette for the journey, he insisted on trying to book one for me; he took my ticket (which I meekly gave him), returned triumphant and then helped me with my cases and backpack to the train. Predictably enough, as it now seems (though I'm sure I didn't foresee it at the time), what he had actually booked was a two-berth first-class wagon-lit. He bundled me in, took off my clothes and had sex, before departing to the upper bunk.

John Burland, a soil engineer and professor at Imperial College, London, is instrumental in the \u00a315m plan to save Italy's most famous construction error. He told the British Association the tower was moving back at 1.5mm a day, as 15 cubic metres of soft silt and clay were gently sucked from underneath the foundations at one side. The aim was to move its highest point 45cm, restoring the tilt to what it had been before a lurch in 1838. Professor Burland was the soil engineer who estimated the possible tilt of the tower of the Houses of Parliament with the construction of an underground car park in 1970. \"We didn't do too badly, but the clock tower moved in the opposite direction from the one we predicted,\" he confessed. In 1990 he joined a commission set up by the Italian prime minister to stabilise Pisa's tower, the ultimate civil engineering challenge. Previously he had helped in the 40-metre deep excavation of the Jubilee tube line under Big Ben, and here he used the experience of the 1970s in order to protect the tower by gently injecting 132 cubic metres of grout (sand and cement) under it. The solution adopted to rescue Pisa was a mirror image of that for Big Ben. \"Instead of pumping grout on the low side of the tower - which would have had it over, it was so close to collapse - we did the reverse.

The Gypsy Council and Eli Frankham, who - like his forefathers - has been going to the fair at Horsmonden all his life, had claimed that the decision to stop the event, which takes place on the village green every second Sunday of September, was an \"unnecessary overreaction\". Their counsel, Jan Luba QC, told deputy judge David Pannick in London that to the Romany community the fair was \"an essential part of their remaining limited calendar of social and cultural events and its existence is integral to their traditional way of life\". But the judge, who had to give his ruling before 6pm when the order banning the fair under the 1986 Public Order Act was due to start, said Tunbridge Wells borough council and the home secretary had acted lawfully. The order lasts until Monday morning. He said it was surprising that the Romany community had not made its challenge in April when the local parish council decided to cancel the fair - the first step in the process. The parish council said the fair had outgrown the village, giving rise to disorder and disruption to the community. The judge said the impact of the cancellation was mitigated by the existence, 20 miles away at Dartford, of an alternative private site for the fair. He made no order for costs and refused permission to appeal. Press Association",

Union officials, contractors and reputed members of the Lucchese crime family were among those charged with a racket in which a 5% \"mob tax\" was levied on work in New York, worth $40m (about \u00a327m) over the past three years. Steven Crea, said to be the Lucchese family's 53-year-old acting boss, and 10 other members or associates of organised crime were alleged to have bought off corrupt union leaders and extorted money from contractors by promising protection from other mobsters. The projects included building three schools, road and bridge repairs and work on the Park Central hotel in midtown Manhattan, formerly known as the Park Sheraton, where the fabled hitman Albert Anastasia was shot dead in a barber's chair 43 years ago. The Mafia's grip on the construction industry was thought to have been broken after dozens of gangsters, building firms and union officials were convicted in the late 1980s and early 90s. \"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance,\" said Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. \"You can't declare victory and walk away. The fight against organised crime is far from over.\" The power and influence of New York's so-called Five Families were reduced drastically by internecine warfare and aggressive legal action, with a large measure of the credit taken by Rudy Giuliani, then a prosecutor and now the city's mayor. When John Gotti, the Teflon Don who headed the Gambino family, was jailed for life for murder and racketeering in 1992, that was taken to be the mob's nadir. Popular culture has taken to representing the Mafia as warped buffoons rather than figures from a corpse-strewn opera, the most recent examples being the television series The Sopranos, Analyze This, the movie starring Robert De Niro, and Jim Jarmusch's film Ghost Dog. But there have been signs of regrouping and claims that the Bonanno family, thought 10 years ago to be on the brink of expiring, has forged its way back to a position second only to the dominant Genovese. This is said to be the work of one Joe Massino, an unflashy character who has imposed order and discipline on an organisation that supposedly specialises in the relatively low-risk areas of illegal book-making and loan-sharking. \"I don't believe there is such a thing as the Mafia,\" said Mr Massino. \"A bunch of Italians go out to eat and they say it's the Mafia.\"",

He made his first movie, the punk classic Repo Man, on Hollywood money, then did his best to get as far away from Tinseltown as possible.</p> <p>\"The film director's career is designed to take you to Hollywood - Alan Parker is a good example. He started on commercials, then he made films that glorify the FBI,\" says Cox, referring to his fellow compatriot's film Mississippi Burning. \"Now he's head of the Film Council.\" </p> <p>Cox's career has taken a different path. Between occasional acting jobs and presenting the BBC's Moviedrome, he has made the junkie saga Sid and Nancy, the spaghetti western homage Straight to Hell, the Nicaraguan odyssey Walker, and the Spanish-language police-corruption drama, Highway Patrolman. \"After Sid and Nancy, I kept getting junkie scripts, which was the last thing I wanted to do.\" </p> <p>Cox's tastes are as catholic as his creations. At his Liverpool base, he keeps the videos that continue to inspire him. At the top of the heap are 20 by the great surrealist Luis Bunuel. \"He's the man. I don't think he ever made a bad film, and most directors do. I like his Mexican films best, in particular The Exterminating Angel, which is his first satire of the bourgeoisie. But Bunuel was really a bourgeois himself, for all that he was an anarchist; he was unfaithful to his wife, he was a wine connoisseur and a gourmand. He was just like Fernando Rey, who always plays the character in his films that is satirised the most.\" </p> <p>Cox has recently made a documentary on another of his heroes, Kurosawa. \"He was cantankerous, exigent, a difficult person. I'm very impressed by his last film, Madadayo, which is critical of Japanese society and of his own status within it - as an old man revered by a bunch of fools - very like King Lear, and therefore Ran [Kurosawa's film of Lear]. It's about the fallibility of old age, and of the false nature of the great man, and Kurosawa was that great man.\" </p> <p>How direct an influence do these cherished films have? \"You just steal from them. We stole the structure of Kiss Me Deadly for Repo Man. Before that it was just an anecdotal tale of LA punks and a car repossession firm.\" Straight to Hell was a tribute to another film in his collection, Django Kill. \"After the success of Django, there were all kinds of spin-offs, and this is a particularly obscure, violent and perverse one which you would only know about if you were a spaghetti western fanatic. I have two versions of it.\" </p> <p>Cox also has the original Django, another obscurity called Tepepa, which features Orson Welles as a Mexican general, and three versions of Big Silence, a slice of Italian nastiness by Sergio Corbucci, director of the original Django. \"It's the only film I know where the bad guys win. Films like this killed the American westerns - Peckinpah politicised the genre, and spaghetti westerns turned it inside out. They were dances of death.\" </p> <p>Moviedrome detritus also fills the shelf space: Tarkovsky's Solaris, Godard's Alphaville, Mike Hodges' Get Carter, along with the work of German pioneers Fassbinder and Herzog - although Cox's admiration really lies with Herzog's old leading man Klaus Kinski, demonised by his former friend in a documentary. \"As a director, you're complicit in what happens to your cast, yet he makes out that it was Kinski who was impossible and not him. What he doesn't appreciate is how loyal Kinski was to him. Many actors betray their talent for money, and Kinski never did that.\" </p> <p>If the films in Cox's collection have anything in common, it is that they all possess a certain defiance, and you get the impression that he is unforgiving on those who fall short of this. One of his favourite films is Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man. \"Anderson came from a patrician background, yet he was a standard-bearer for breaking down its conventions. But I lost respect for him after he made a TV film called The Old Crowd. The critics hated it, and up until then he had been their golden boy. He lost his confidence, went on to make absolute rubbish and just became a wimp. These rich kids can't take a licking.\" Has Cox ever had a licking? \"Oh, now and then.\" </p> <p>Cox also keeps a selection of little-known Russian and Mexican favourites close at hand, and King Kong and Citizen Kane, but few modern Hollywood movies. He can recognise a fellow dissident spirit, however. \"I admire Paul Verhoeven. He's making these giant special effects films, but he's managed to maintain his own sense of perversity. Starship Troopers has teenage heroes who are Nazis - didn't the studio heads realise? </p> <p>\"But even he had a price to pay. He was on our Kurosawa documentary and a Dutch guy saw it and said, 'That's not Verhoeven. Those aren't his teeth.' He has to deal with studio execs and actors the whole time, and you've got to have perfect teeth to do that. The question is, is it worth it?\" Cox's teeth, by the way, are all over the place.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is currently a clutch of Hollywood directors who share a similar reputation for big-budget, star-studded and visually extravagant movies. They also share something slightly more improbable: a background in 30-second adverts for sports shoes. </p> <p>Next week sees the release of The Cell, the first feature film to be directed by prince among ad directors, Tarsem Singh. He is the latest to have joined the prestigious alumni of Nike commercials directors who have successfully transferred their skills to a feature length format. </p> <p>For company, he has the likes of David Fincher, Spike Jonze and Dominic Sena and he will soon be joined by Anthony Hoffman, director of the forthcoming Val Kilmer movie, Red Planet. Can it be mere coincidence that the Nike campaign has for over a decade been breeding Hollywood directors at such an impressive rate? Perhaps. After all, a company with such a glamorous brand and big budget is likely to recruit the world's hottest ad directors - and these ad directors invariably end up dabbling in features anyway. (Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne and the brothers Scott proved this point long ago). </p> <p>The advertising agency who create the ads and hire the directors would beg to differ. \"We've always gone for the directors who will take our ideas and run with them, regardless of whether they're big names or not,\" says Wieden and Kennedy producer Henry Lu, who works on the Nike campaign. It appears that when inexperienced directors walk into Wieden and Kennedy for meetings with Nike executives, they come out again ready to shoot multi-million dollar movies for Hollywood's biggest studios. So what's their secret?</p> <p> Certainly, it's an ad agency with a reputation for an absurdly creative atmosphere - complete with an in-house basketball court and games of hockey in the corridors. Tarsem is keenly aware of the advantages of working for such a company: \"Nike always come to you with a more open brief,\" he says. \"They don't give you a storyboard and tell you to make an ad in the way their executives have already decided. Instead, they seek out directors that they think will bring their own ideas along. They're not interested in giving you a present that you just have to put on film.

In 1994's Good Versus Evil ad, he created a visual spectacular while simultaneously conveying a compelling storyline whereby the Devil was destroyed by Eric Cantona. He is keen to play down the significance of his narrative skills, how ever. \"The advertising trend, particularly with Nike, is for aggressive, explosive visuals,\" he says. \"That's also a very popular look in Hollywood and so they will ask me to do that sort of a film. No one in Hollywood is going to look at my Nike ads and think: 'This guy would be perfect for a film that's dialogue-driven.' They're going to think I'd be good for a very visually dramatic film. In fact, if they hired me on the basis of my ads then asked me to do something where the narrative was driven by dialogue I'd be shocked.\"</p> <p> There is more to winning the attentions of Hollywood producers than a few spectacular shots. Nike's advertising agency are particularly proud of their endeavours to tell universal tales. \"For better or for worse, we've always tried to concentrate on the entertainment rather than the advertising,\" says Henry Lu. \"And Nike are more lenient with us in that sense. If we'd taken the idea for Good vs Evil to other clients, they would have said: 'Yeah right! When do we get to see the shoes?' But Nike just loved it and let us get on with it.\" </p> <p>Nike's size helps. You could show a Hollywood producer the greatest 30-second ad ever created but if it turned out to be promoting the virtues of, say, Winalot, they wouldn't be convinced.

He is certain of the brand's cachet. \"No matter what other ads I had on my reel, the Hollywood executives always responded to Nike,\" he says.\"The guys in Hollywood are already aware that there are a lot of ad directors who can shoot the hell out of something,\" he says. \"But they also want to know if you can tell a story.

Tarsem says that working on a movie makes you long to make an ad - just as being back in ads makes you long for another movie. He, along with Hoffman and Fincher, will get the chance to prove their worth when their brand new Nike ads are broadcast throughout the forthcoming Olympics. \"Directors love to shoot,\" he says. \"Hollywood is all about lunches and meetings. You've got to be shooting something in between and, as it happens, once you've made a movie you come back as a better ad director.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Cell is released on September 15.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is currently a clutch of Hollywood directors who share a similar reputation for big-budget, star-studded and visually extravagant movies. They also share something slightly more improbable: a background in 30-second adverts for sports shoes. Next week sees the release of The Cell, the first feature film to be directed by prince among ad directors, Tarsem Singh. He is the latest to have joined the prestigious alumni of Nike commercials directors who have successfully transferred their skills to a feature length format. For company, he has the likes of David Fincher, Spike Jonze and Dominic Sena and he will soon be joined by Anthony Hoffman, director of the forthcoming Val Kilmer movie, Red Planet. Can it be mere coincidence that the Nike campaign has for over a decade been breeding Hollywood directors at such an impressive rate? Perhaps. After all, a company with such a glamorous brand and big budget is likely to recruit the world's hottest ad directors - and these ad directors invariably end up dabbling in features anyway. (Alan Parker, Adrian Lyne and the brothers Scott proved this point long ago). The advertising agency who create the ads and hire the directors would beg to differ. \"We've always gone for the directors who will take our ideas and run with them, regardless of whether they're big names or not,\" says Wieden and Kennedy producer Henry Lu, who works on the Nike campaign. It appears that when inexperienced directors walk into Wieden and Kennedy for meetings with Nike executives, they come out again ready to shoot multi-million dollar movies for Hollywood's biggest studios. So what's their secret? Certainly, it's an ad agency with a reputation for an absurdly creative atmosphere - complete with an in-house basketball court and games of hockey in the corridors. Tarsem is keenly aware of the advantages of working for such a company: \"Nike always come to you with a more open brief,\" he says. \"They don't give you a storyboard and tell you to make an ad in the way their executives have already decided. Instead, they seek out directors that they think will bring their own ideas along. They're not interested in giving you a present that you just have to put on film. I wouldn't say they train you to be a feature film director, it's just that they happen to look for the same sort of people that Hollywood look for. \"They want their directors to be able to work with constantly-shifting goal posts and ideas that evolve continually throughout the shoot. And because their ads very often involve superstars, they want directors who are going to be able to deal with them. These are things that aren't necessary with all ads but are necessary when you're making a feature film.\" Tarsem had also spent years displaying an abundance of craft via his work for Nike.

In fact, if they hired me on the basis of my ads then asked me to do something where the narrative was driven by dialogue I'd be shocked.\" There is more to winning the attentions of Hollywood producers than a few spectacular shots.

      "body": "<p>Say hello to the brilliant young man, the great hope of modern Hollywood. And the first thing you notice is the absence; what he doesn't walk in with. Because however you define star quality - the glint of an eye, the ease of a smile - Edward Norton doesn't have it. If you're searching for a movie idol, you're in the wrong place. With his black jeans and Gap T-shirt, he looks just like what he is: an intelligent, educated American of a certain age and background. </p> <p>Handshake, small talk about his jet lag. Nothing special. But take a look at that CV: it's immaculate. A breakthrough from nowhere in the 1996 thriller Primal Fear, followed by triumph after triumph after triumph. No wrong moves, just critical sweet talk every time he steps onscreen, supported by the patronage of directors as diverse as Woody Allen and Milos Forman, John Dahl and David Fincher. A list to which, two weeks after his 31st birthday, his own name can now be added with the romantic comedy Keeping the Faith, wherein he appears both behind and in front of the camera. </p> <p>We should have seen it coming. Ascension always came naturally for Norton, the eldest son of a teacher and an attorney, brought up in Columbia, Maryland, a planned community designed by his architect grandfather, James Rouse. He attended Yale, majoring in history between theatre productions and Japanese classes. Even now, there's something unshakably Ivy League about him: a hesitant laugh, a pensive articulacy. </p> <p>But don't think you can pin him down that quickly, the rich boy with the good life. After working in Osaka for his grandfather's Enterprise Foundation (\"designed to create decent housing for low-income families\"), he spent five years in New York, in dead-end jobs, appearing off-Broadway, losing out in auditions. He wasn't brilliant. Not yet. He only turned brilliant with Primal Fear. When Leonardo DiCaprio - remember him? - exited the project, he screen-tested for the pivotal role of an altar boy with a venomously split personality. Norton gently stuttered through a peach of an Appalachian accent. The gig was his; he stole the film. </p> <p>Afterwards, with scripts his for the taking, he cherry-picked: an east coast fop in Allen's Everyone Says I Love You, an eager lawyer in Forman's The People Vs Larry Flynt, a Bacchanalian gambler in Dahl's Rounders, a brutal neo-Nazi in the flawed but fascinating American History X. Then came Fincher's Fight Club, in which he flaunted his bruises with corporate fascism and Swedish furniture. It was quite some performance, in quite some film. He was the new Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro rolled into one: the leading man du jour, a face fit for magazine covers. </p> <p>Not that he likes that part of the deal. Sure, he enjoys discussing the mechanics of his trade. Ask him about The Score, his next project, in which he stars opposite both De Niro and Marlon Brando, and he shakes his head in excitement: \"God, when I was watching those two guys, those two great, gestural, non-verbal guys, I realised I was just staring at them - they could have been reciting the phone book.\" Mention Method acting and there's a 10- minute discourse: \"In terms of using your sense memory, that's something I've never agreed with. I was discussing it with Bob on-set...\" Talk shop with Edward Norton, and you get the same fierce, focused engagement you assume he had when, at eight, he turned to his teacher while rehearsing Annie Get Your Gun and enquired: \"What's my objective here?\" </p> <p>It's the fluff that's the problem. Forget, his rumoured relationships (rumoured because he refuses to discuss them) with Courtney Love, Drew Barrymore and, lately, Salma Hayek. For Norton, the dispassionate demeanour and the average-Joe garb aren't accidental, as much as pathological. \"I've kind of reached a point,\" he says, \"where I can manage the media process. But I rarely find that anything of value results from it. I mean, I recognise it's regarded as necessary by the commercial engine behind the films, so I'm happy to talk about the film in question and the field I'm in, without having to talk about me per se. I just think there are higher-minded conversations to be had than talking about my fairly humdrum daily life.\" </p> <p>Only there's something else to his reserve, a longstanding conviction that blank canvases make the best actors (\"the more you load people up on your own life, the more disbelief they have to suspend\") and a repulsion at the idea of selling himself to the media. The rest of us may be amusing ourselves to death but, to Norton, the entire celebrity circus needs moving on. He looks as angry as he gets when I ask why the films themselves are never enough. \"The thing is, whether you're an intelligent journalist or an intelligent actor, there's this consistent pressure to deliver for the broadest common denominator, and an assumption of a lack of sophistication on the part of the audience. And I think that's wrong. I really do. I think that's fundamentally wrong. And I actually think it's in the best interests of democracy not to just blithely accept it.\" </p> <p>He'll stash his anonymity for Keeping the Faith. And, at least in the US, the reward has been yet more garlands; even if, this time round, the plaudits are exaggerated. Because, while Norton's directorial debut is far from shoddy, it is deeply, weirdly anachronistic: a screwball New York menage a trois concerning a priest (played by Norton), his rabbinical best friend, and the girl both are pining for. It's laden with peppy one-liners and incessant group hugs. </p> <p>The result is not dissimilar to a two-hour episode of Friends. Which is a strange enough place to see Edward Norton appearing, let alone find him starting his career as a film-maker. \"Oh yeah, I see that. But it wasn't done out of any conscious desire to have people say, 'Oh, how different for him.' I mean, I'd written the film with Stuart [Blumberg, a friend from Yale], I was producing it, the window came up and I started to think what was the point in giving this to someone else so we could sit around wondering if they would get the jokes? And I even called Fincher and Milos and said, 'Listen, is there any downside to this not being the kind of film I would have expected to do?' And they both said absolutely, categorically no. Just take the chance.\" </p> <p>Still, it takes some swallowing that, after the racist thugs and pugilistic salarymen, Keeping the Faith just happened to be so frothy; that a man whose first movie centred on a Catholic priest sexually abusing his choristers is now casting himself as a minister whose only foible appears to be his incompetence at basketball. \"Well, I love those kinds of movies. I loved The Philadelphia Story and Jules et Jim, those complicated, relationship-based comic dramas. And, besides it being fun, there was a substantive foundation. I mean, if you strip away the fact it's about a rabbi and a priest, what you have is three people wrestling with turning 30, which I was at the time, where certain assumptions you had about yourself just don't seem to work any more.' </p> <p>But, even in a film like Keeping the Faith, there's an undercurrent: the same undercurrent that marked out Derek, anti-hero of American History X, and the anarchist narrator of Fight Club, and now ripples through Father Brian, the kindly cleric. It's the need for something to believe in, for something real. And if Faith and Fight Club have anything in common, it's that same hostility to the hip, the knowing, and the ironic: the desire for authenticity, whether via God or an Ikea-baiting revolution. So, is this what's pulling Edward Norton's strings? </p> <p>\"Yeah. And actually, in Larry Flynt as well. Hmmm. I mean, I personally have never really connected with that vision of our generation as this aimless, angst-ridden mass, that's one of the reasons I liked Fight Club - because it was about something I believe, that our generation's disease is not aimless angst, but a real despair. It's like what Radiohead are getting at on OK Computer, that feeling of being truly oppressed by modernity, and having a desperate need to reconnect with an authentic self. And, yeah, one of the things I like about Keeping the Faith is that these characters are searching for that same authenticity.\" </p> <p> All of which, with Hollywood busy grooming him as a hybrid of Jimmy Stewart's everyman and Orson Welles's precocious genius, raises a question: namely, once you've got the world's attention, what do you do with it? What does the man who could be anything do with his time? Do a De Niro and keep hacking out the character roles? Use that actorly gravitas and follow the lead of Warren Beatty, who once called him out of the blue to offer him career advice, and flirt with political power beyond the confines of Beverly Hills? Or maybe just try to make better, more honest films? </p> <p>\"Well,\" he says, \"I get a little tired of irony being the only way of looking at the world, and of deflecting our vulnerability with glib denials. I don't think that's anything like what our generation is really about. And yeah, in both Keeping the Faith and Fight Club, you've got these characters who are opening their arms and getting ready to be whacked, whether that's through loving another person, or being seduced by nihilism. And if people come to equate me with that kind of openness, then I take that as a compliment.\" </p> <p>And what if - or when - the lustre comes off in his hands, if, after the promotional dust settles, people aren't shocked at the bold departure of Keeping the Faith as much as disappointed by it. What happens to a brilliant young man when he falls on his face? \"Oh, I'm prepared for that. Sure. I mean, in the industry town where I have to work, a lot of people regard Fight Club as a failure, simply because it lost money, which to me is ridiculous. But, yeah, at some point something I'm working on won't come as close to what I wanted as the films I've done so far. It's too potentially disastrous a process for that. I mean, there are great Beatles songs, and there are lesser Beatles songs...\" </p> <p>He spins around, makes sure to catch my eye. \"Not that I'm comparing myself to the Beatles. But yes, I'd rather take the chance and work on something which is on some level a discussion of how we're living, and where we should be going. And if that doesn't come off, which one day it won't, then fine. You know? At least I took the chance.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Keeping the Faith is released on September 15.</p>",

But, yeah, at some point something I'm working on won't come as close to what I wanted as the films I've done so far. It's too potentially disastrous a process for that. I mean, there are great Beatles songs, and there are lesser Beatles songs...\" He spins around, makes sure to catch my eye. \"Not that I'm comparing myself to the Beatles. But yes, I'd rather take the chance and work on something which is on some level a discussion of how we're living, and where we should be going. And if that doesn't come off, which one day it won't, then fine. You know? At least I took the chance.\" \u0095 Keeping the Faith is released on September 15.",

      "body": "<p>Charlie Lustman recalls the first time he saw the Silent Movie Theatre lying derelict on Hollywood's Fairfax Avenue: \"I walked past the place one day and I swear it was saying, 'Save me.'\" That was in April 1999; six months and $1m later, the Silent Movie Theatre had reopened for business. \"I knew nothing about restoring buildings and had never seen a silent film,\" Lustman continues. \"I think that's important, because I was not saying to the kids, 'Hey, you must see this silent film, it's always been in my life.' But I'm saying, 'Give it a try, you might learn something.'\" </p> <p>On its first week, the audience were so advanced in years that some had even worked in the movies they were about to watch. One attendee observed: \"It looked as if the youngest person in the house was about 88.\" But things were to change, as professionals, college students and kids started to buy tickets. A month on and the whisper was that silent movies had actually become fashionable. Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie were seen sitting in the back row. Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid were said to sit mesmerised by the flickering images before them. Suzanne Ault, of the entertainment bible Variety, said: \"Hollywood people are always looking for something new. Right now this is it.\" </p> <p>Lustman believes that the Silent Movie Theatre, as a permanent fixture, will entice the filmgoer long after the initial honeymoon period has worn off. \"There is a yearning for purity that is self-evident in silent film. It unites people of all nations - because these films are silent, there is no dialogue. And their appeal is universal.\" </p> <p>The Silent Movie Theatre has stood in its present position for the last 58 years. Like so many other buildings of historical interest in Los Angeles, it had been earmarked for demolition. But two years ago, a restaurateur stepped in to save the building, planning to turn it into a Mexican gourmet food store. Then Lustman appeared: \"It didn't seem like a solid investment at first.\" </p> <p>The theatre's previous owner was Lawrence Austin, a film enthusiast who had acquired the building from Dorothy Hampton. She and her husband John didn't believe people would ever want to see a silent film again when they bought it in the early 40s, but intended to keep it as shrine to a bygone era, and would screen films for their own enjoyment and that of close friends. Mark McLaughlin, a colleague of Charlie Lustman, says: \"It is largely thanks to the Hamptons that a number of classic masterpieces survived. They would tour the studios to buy silent films and, because nobody wanted them, they amassed a sizeable collection.\" </p> <p>When the theatre was boarded up in the 70s it was believed, wrongly, that the couple had gone from whence they came. \"John and Dorothy hadn't gone away,\" remembered actress Mae Madison, a former Busby Berkeley Girl. \"They hid like church mice behind the broken-down facade, hanging onto their films. I don't know how they survived.\" </p> <p>John Hampton died in 1990 from lung cancer, apparently contracted from exposure to the chemicals he used in his pioneering attempts to restore the old negatives. To meet medical bills, the Hamptons sold their print collection for some $400,000. Lawrence Austin, a son of one of the couple's friends who sometimes paid visits to see films, approached Dorothy about opening the theatre again. The shutters came off in 1991 and, although rather haphazard, public screenings recommenced. </p> <p>Then, in January 1997, the cinema's history took a dark turn: Austin was murdered in the auditorium as a Larry Semon comedy short was flickering before a small audience. A gunman walked up and shot him twice in the chest. The gunman, a 19-year-old called Christian Rodriguez, was hired by James Van Sickle, Austin's gay lover, who worked as a projectionist. Van Sickle, heavily in debt, was to inherit the business after Austin's death and felt he couldn't afford to wait for his boyfriend to die of natural causes. With Austin now dead, and Van Sickle and his accomplice charged with murder, the doors were padlocked shut. Further down Fairfax Avenue, Dorothy sat in a nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's disease, totally unaware of what had happened to her beloved theatre. </p> <p>It was two years later that Charlie Lustman noticed the \"For Sale\" signs as he munched a falafel sandwich at a nearby stall. The $1m Lustman needed to restore the cinema was raised through a consortium of investors and rich friends. \"I persuaded enough people so I could take the place back to its former glory.\" </p> <p>Finding the film stock to screen was another task. Most of the major studios had either lost or destroyed cans of silent films to make way for sound, thinking that it was history and so obsolete. Former silent film stars were tracked down through the Screen Actors Guild in the hope that they might have an original print of their own. Charles Rosher was once the most famous and highly paid cameraman in the world, having worked at Universal Studios before becoming a cinematographer to the biggest silent screen actress of them all, Mary Pickford; his daughter, Joan Marsh, herself an actress working in silents throughout the 1930s and early 40s, remembered when a call came through requesting any film material. \"I knew this young guy was trying to locate old movies,\" said Marsh, who sadly died last month. \"I had some of father's in the barn outside. I should've investigated earlier, as when I opened the cans there was nothing but dust!\" </p> <p>Despite the odds, Lustman began to find footage and to his amazement complete and beautifully restored films, mostly belonging to private collectors. A few let him show them for nothing. </p> <p>Irving Thalberg said that silent film was never truly silent because it always had someone in the orchestra pit hammering away at an organ. The organist would watch the movie and play, adjusting the score to the mood of the film. </p> <p>Bob Mitchell's career waned when the talkies arrived. He, more than anyone else, is excited by Lustman's venture as, after nearly six decades as an out of work organist, he has a job again. Bob, now 94, plays with a new passion. His eyes light up as the house fills with an audience. \"It's great to see young people settle down and watch the screen. Those kids with shaved heads, baggy pants and skateboards are fascinated by the films they've paid to come and see.\" </p> <p>Bob stands in the lobby holding onto his walking stick. The walls behind him bear the portraits of the silent screen actors who were superstars when he was young: Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Harold Lloyd, Billie Dove, Gloria Swanson, Harry Langdon and the Talmadge sisters. \"I think I actually helped their careers by accompanying their movies with music. Yeah, I honestly believe that. My job was very sought after in 1922.\" </p> <p>\"The circumstance surrounding the theatre could make for a great movie\", grins Lustman. \"It could be silent, but no one is serious about financing a silent movie anymore. That is why it is important to keep this place alive. I love it when I look into the dark and see 50 faces six nights a week waiting in anticipation to watch a movie with Rudolph Valentino, Garbo, Chaplin, Gloria Swanson or Clara Bow.\" </p> <p>And people still flock to the final resting-places of Hollywood's golden icons. Tom DeMille (no relation to Cecil) is the managing director of the Hollywood Cemetery. He is a tall thin man with pure white teeth and an orange suntan and looks like some thing between magician David Copperfield and Barry Manilow. He has been employed there for the past eight years, although has been a daily visitor for the last 15. \"Old stars are big,\" he told me. \"Every week we have someone come into the mausoleum where Rudolph Valentino is buried to clean the lipstick-prints off his tomb... No sooner is your back turned than they are back again. The Hollywood Cemetery is one of the city's biggest tourist attractions; lots of people come out here to find the final resting-place of their heroes. Sure Lustman's movie house will be a big success. Old movie stars are big business.\" </p> <p>The actress Anita Page, who was there the night the theatre officially re-opened, is about the last of the silent stars still living and it is she who has the last word: \"If I'd known my films were going to be watched again by a whole new audience, I'd have acted a whole lot better!\" </p> <p> \u0095 For more information: <a href=\"http://www.silentmovietheatre.com\">www.silentmovietheatre.com</a></p>",

However, writer/director Paul Anderson (Shopping; Event Horizon) is keen to point out that he came up with the idea way back in 1994, before The Sixth Sense had been dreamt up. Perhaps influenced by The X-Files, he's created a piece of TV with a similarly striking visual impact: \"I really wanted to get away from the rather hackneyed idea of just another detective story, so I decided to create a central character who solves the mystery but isn't a professional policeman. I decided to make him an architect, partly because it's different, but also because the murders of the children take place in specific places which are an integral part of the mystery.\" </p> <p>Anderson came up with the idea of Andrew McCarthy early on in the project: \"I'm very instinctual when it comes to casting, and as soon as he walked through the door to meet me in Los Angeles, I knew he was the right person. He was literally the first person I saw for the role, and I knew there and then that he'd be perfect. What's great about Andrew is that as he's moved away from the Brat Pack image, he's got this slightly haunted look about him, so you can believe he can see these ghosts. He has that great combination of the depth required to play the scary stuff, mixed with a light comic touch. It was important to me to find somebody who had that range.\" </p> <p>Executive Producer Jeremy Bolt was also thrilled when they managed to sign up the former pin-up: \"To us he's a kind of icon. The boy that we all loved watching in those movies has now become a man and he carries a lot of history in his eyes. It was important to us to cast someone who could be convincing as an architect and someone who the audience would accept as intellectual - there's an intelligence about Andrew. We were after someone who was handsome and strong without being macho; someone who could look tormented; who you'd believe had these demons, but who also had a sense of humour and lightness. We basically wanted an actor who could play light and dark and who also had name value.\" </p> <p>McCarthy himself is too modest to wallow in this sort of praise, but he does admit to ditching the \"pejorative\" Brat Pack label. It's something he's always tried to ignore. \"Only in hindsight was I aware that it was a big deal,\" he explains. \"I don't think I've seen any of those people since we finished St Elmo's Fire. And I've never met Anthony Michael Hall.\" </p> <p>McCarthy was the Mr Nice of the 80s, the sensible member of the Brat Pack. The characters he played seemed a touch deeper than those played by Lowe, Estevez and Nelson. Films like 1983's Class and John Hughes' Pretty In Pink (with McCarthy as a rich boy courting Molly Ringwald) rewarded him with a million-dollar lifestyle. He had follow-up roles in Less Than Zero and Weekend At Bernie's, but by this time the Brat Pack craze was dying down as grown-ups returned to the cinema. </p> <p>The 38-year-old recently returned to the stage with a role in an off-Broadway play. Now he's waiting for reactions to the pilot for The Sight, as is Anderson, who has pledged to stay involved if a series is commissioned. Anderson has already tried to emulate Hollywood blockbusters (his attempt to cash in on the Terminator series with his futuristic thriller Soldier failed to achieve similar success), but whether Architect Michael Lewis can become as popular as Agent Fox Mulder remains to be seen. </p> <p>\u0095 The Sight, 9pm, Sunday, Sky One</p>",

Instead we've been given a steady drip of the stuff that really matters. We know, for example, that on a photo shoot Ritchie and producer Matthew Vaughn got locked in a high-stakes poker game from which they couldn't be distracted. That Ritchie plucked some of the cast off the street (Andy the doorman from Bow, Addy the east end wheeler dealer); that Brad Pitt didn't use a stand-in for his bare-knuckle boxing scenes and that between takes the cast would play chess, gamble, and generally muck about at full \"Oi! On me 'ead\" volume, in their own brand of rhyming slang. </p> <p>We know that Ritchie used many of the same actors and crew as he did on Lock, Stock and that, when the big Hollywood finger comes out of the sky, those boys are going with him. Somehow the issue with Snatch is not whether Ritchie has pulled off another artful dodgy movie but whether he's still the geezer, the captain of macho mateyness, the self-styled king of camaraderie. You don't even need to have seen the film to know that it has achieved what it set out to, namely to create a bloke bonding session that makes Arsenal supporters look like a bunch of noncommittal ponces. </p> <p>What Ritchie and Vaughn have spotted is not (as their imitators imagined) a gap in the market for homegrown gangster movies, but a chance to exploit something at which the British male is still perceived to be a world leader - old fashioned camaraderie. Ritchie's milieu is a post-Krays fantasy, populated with Crombie-wearing diamond geezers who may be murderers, but they'd never let you down. It's about friends, male friends, the kind that Chris Evans and Gazza and Danny Baker longed to be. </p> <p>This is why Brad Pitt, who seems to be more than usually afflicted with the \"acting is a poof's job\" complex, asked to be in on whatever Ritchie did after Lock Stock: because it was a guaranteed mate-fest about mates, for mates and just being there, having a laugh over the pints and pickled eggs, and would do more for his cred than $10m. Pitt has been quoted saying that the cast blew him away: \"I was really taken with the camaraderie these guys have together.\" No mention of the genius of the director, the brilliance of the script, just bloody marvellous testosterone-tanked up mates. </p> <p>Coincidentally, Brad has just married Jennifer Aniston, who was made by the 90s pals comedy, Friends. Ritchie, further down the line, detected that all that fluffy, girly, H\u00e4agen-Dazs-sharing stuff has run its course (especially if you are male) and his partner, Madonna, was naturally first to go with the change in mood. One minute she was Miss Tricky, with Rupert Everett at her beck and call, the next she was \"the missus\", up the duff, having her cheeks chucked by Vinnie Jones and being dragged around in a Ritchie armlock, claiming to like nothing more than a pint of Guinness down the Windsor Castle. </p> <p>So it's a shame that Snatch turns out to be the visual equivalent of one of the entries in the Met officer's handbook to London's ethnic and religious minorities. Snatch is the intellectually challenged person's guide to a caricature of London gangland. Every line is delivered at duuuur speed, every bit of geezer dialogue laboured to allow you to memorise the jargon so when you nip round the corner for some pasta afterwards you can start calling the Irish waiter \"piker\", and each other \"mincey faggoty balls\". </p> <p>A bit of illegal boxing, dog fighting, hare coursing, a lot of shooting and sawing up of bodies, endless nothing queer about us jokes, some luverly slang and there you have it: the potted excellent adventure out east for morons. Since Lock, Stock you can't move down the dogs for would-be Vinnies from Kensington. Who knows what'll happen now. </p> <p>Well, for a start, guess who was in the cinema watching Snatch on Saturday night? Gwynie Paltrow and Ben Affleck (she was wearing cream cords and a jumper). Now you'd have thought that they could have arranged to see it without paying \u00a37 and enduring the scrum. But then that would have been to miss the whole point of the exercise, which is to soak up some of the old Brit camaraderie, the old Saturday night fancy-a-Snatch-and-a-sausage scene, and to feel like a real guy and his missus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is alone in the house, with a killer in a ghost mask stalking the neighbourhood. She answers the phone - it appears to be the killer. \"I'm in the house,\" he whispers menacingly. \"Do you know where I am?\" Cindy gasps, then sprints into the living room. The killer continues goading her, laughing maniacally. \"I could be anywhere... I'm like the wind, baby.\" Cindy looks around the room in panic. \"Where am I?\" Cindy notices a pair of feet poking out from behind the sofa. \"Er, you're behind the couch.\" The killer stops laughing. \"Huh? How did you know that?\" \"I can see your feet.\" The killer kneels up, then looks around. Shrugging, he rises to his feet, then chases Cindy up the stairs. She throws a vase at him; he brushes it aside. Next she hurls a bicycle; he ducks out of the way. Finally, she pushes her grandmother (Babe Dolan) down the stairs, who falls in a crumpled heap on top of the killer. As both stagger to their feet, Cindy pushes a piano towards them. Missing the killer completely, it then flattens her grandmother.
