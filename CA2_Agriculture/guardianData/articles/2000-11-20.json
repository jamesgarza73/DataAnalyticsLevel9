And of course the Pakistan spinners were favourites to do the producing. </p> <p>The stalemate that fizzled out yesterday pointed to two major factors. The pitch has proved too slow for all the bowlers, and the batsmen on both sides produced obdurate cricket. It was not a pretty match but it will boost England more than the hosts. </p> <p>Nick Botting, the artist commissioned by MCC for a series of paintings at this game, had more fun watching his own paint dry on the final day than the spectators had viewing the action, such as it was. </p> <p>The game ended in a draw thanks mainly to a wonderful innings over the weekend by Yousuf Youhana. One of the younger members of the Pakistan side at 26, he has played 25 matches and averages more than 36, a figure which will increase over the next few years. Significantly he is the only player ever present in the Pakistan team this year, having played nine Tests and 41 one-day internationals. </p> <p>His innings of 124 was his career best and spanned six hours and 13 minutes. Whether he saved Pakistan from defeat may be a moot point but he certainly saved them from following on on Saturday evening. </p> <p>He came to the crease when Pakistan were 199 for three and stayed until he was ninth out at 400, undone eventually by the persevering Ashley Giles who nicked his outside edge. At 236 for six Pakistan still needed 45 to avoid the follow-on and Youhana's heart must have skipped a beat when, eight short of the 281, his former captain and senior partner Wasim Akram tamely popped a catch to mid-wicket. </p> <p>From this point, though, Youhana took total control of the innings, nursing his partner Saqlain past the follow-on and then ensuring Pakistan were safe by batting until lunch on the last day. This was an innings of maturity and class and marked him alongside Saeed Anwar and Inzamam-ul-Haq as the key to Pakistan's batting strength. </p> <p>Yousuf Youhana is a local boy from a working-class background. His father was a railway worker and the family lived only yards from the Lahore railway station. The streets were his playground and, with such limited facilities and resources at his disposal, it is almost a fairy tale that he has assumed hero status in his own city and his own country. Lahore is his favourite ground. In three Tests here he has had scores of 120 not out, 83, 0 and now 124, averaging an amazing 109. </p> <p>Astute observers will have noticed that Youhana crosses himself as he steps into the ground and again when he gets to the milestones of 50 and 100. He is only the fifth non-Muslim to play for Pakistan. Thus his Christian beliefs set him apart from the rest of his side but there is no exclusion, his popularity with team-mates and the opposition bears witness to that. </p> <p>His contribution was not lost on the Pakistan captain Moin Khan: \"Our boys did well to avert the follow-on. It was a good toss to win for England and they batted well with Thorpe showing the grit. I am extremely pleased with the performance of our boys, especially Saqlain and Youhana.' </p> <p>\"We may look at the option of making a couple of changes for the second Test,\" he added. </p> <p>Both teams will prepare for it, in Faisalabad, in reasonable heart. England still have their fair share of injury worries - Nasser Hussain's wrist as well as his back - but equally worrying was Ian Salisbury's performance. He was handled with kid gloves by Hussain and curiously by Pakistan's batsmen, who were never in any danger of getting out to the leg-spinner but never collared him either. </p> <p>He may well play in a week's time but England will be stronger if they pick another batsman, Michael Vaughan, or the ebullient Dominic Cork who is always likely to make things happen.</p>",

After an immense ninth-wicket stand between the centurion Yousuf Youhana and Saqlain Mushtaq had propelled the home side to within 79 runs of England's first-innings total, their bowlers reduced the visitors to 77 for four by the time the draw was agreed at four o'clock yesterday. </p> <p>Of course, once Pakistan had avoided the follow-on by the skin of their teeth on Saturday afternoon the remainder of the game was going to be about little more than scoring points. On such days, when the pressure eases and tired cricketers can be vulnerable, it is important to try to escape unscathed. But that went by the board in the course of a memorably fierce new-ball burst from Wasim Akram, proving a point after some criticism of his lacklustre bowling in the first innings; he had spent time icing an ankle, so there may have been mitigation. </p> <p>The England captain Nasser Hussain received a nasty blow on his right wrist in attempting to hook a short ball from Wasim, only the third delivery he faced. He immediately dropped his bat and called for help, and it was obvious he was in some distress. After on-field treatment from Dean Conway he walked disconsolately back to the pavilion. </p> <p>An x-ray revealed no fracture and after the game Hussain, his wrist encased in strapping, explained that the injury would be treated as one to soft tissue and that he was hopeful of being fit for the second Test on Wednesday week in Faisalabad. \"I've got brittle bones so I was concerned,\" he admitted. \"I've been hit a good few times and this is the first time I've ever retired hurt. But I couldn't feel my fingers or get my hand back into the glove. It felt very sore and still does, and it took half an hour for the feeling to come back to the fingers.\" </p> <p>It may be some days before there is confirmation that all is well, because often a fracture reveals itself only once swelling has subsided. Hussain will have a further consultation with a specialist today when he also receives an injection to ease the discomfort in his back. </p> <p>If, however, he thinks that this is the cherry on the cake of a duff year that has seen him score only 267 first-class runs in 23 innings and break his thumb during the summer, then maybe the tide is turning just a little. In striking his wrist, the ball ricocheted down and knocked against the leg stump without dislodging the bail. Even a week ago that would have fallen to the ground as well. </p> <p>Hussain was pleased with the overall performance of his team in a match which many observers expected to be over inside three or four days, with England struggling against the Pakistan spinners. In fact, although it was an exceptional toss to win - as no doubt will also be the case in the next two Tests - England showed a lot of character and variation in method in countering the spin of Saqlain and Mushtaq, in particular Graham Thorpe's diligent century and the vibrancy of Craig White. </p> <p>Saqlain bowled himself inside-out during this match and deserved his nine wickets (it helps to have a bit of mystery on slow pitches, was Hussain's view) but Mushtaq did not take a wicket until he had Mike Atherton lbw in the second innings, looked short of form and may find himself ousted by the young pretender Danish Kanaria. </p> <p>There is a feeling, though, that England, should they encounter precisely these conditions next time around, might well consider a different XI. Unquestionably the situation demanded two spinners but, whereas Ashley Giles acquitted himself through 56 overs, Ian Salisbury represented too high a risk; this was made clear on Saturday when, until Youhana had taken Pakistan to safety, he was allowed only two mundane overs at the start of play and another four after lunch. </p> <p>If the captain cannot trust his spinner then the bowler may as well not be there. White's fine use of reverse swing, and some good work from Andy Caddick too - and indeed Wasim's riposte yesterday afternoon when he also removed Marcus Trescothick with his speed and movement - showed that pace has its place even on placid, dusty pitches. Without trying to prejudge next week's pitch, England would do well to consider the option of the extra batsman in Faisalabad. </p> <p>It took England until 25 minutes after lunch yesterday before White had Mush taq leg-before to end the Pakistan innings. </p> <p>On Saturday they had had just the sniff of something more positive when, with Pakistan needing 281 to avoid the follow-on, seven wickets were down for 273. </p> <p>At this point Youhana had only 37 but he found an adhesive partner in Saqlain. Together the pair added 127 for the ninth wicket, Youhana reaching 124 with a six and eight fours in more than six hours - his fourth and highest Test hundred and third in eight innings - before he gave Giles his fourth wicket by edging to Alec Stewart. Saqlain, though, remained steadfast to the end, 32 not out in four hours' batting. White may have been a challenger for the man-of-the-match award but few quibbled when it went to the off-spinner.

For the second successive year Sunderland had conquered Tyneside; the Toon army sat in stunned silence, struggling to come to terms with Saturday's breathless derby while the 3,000 visiting fans bounced joyfully up in the gods of St James' Park. For Geordies everywhere it promises to be another galling season. </p> <p>Yet it could have been so different. With seven minutes of this pulsating match remaining, Niall Quinn clattered Rob Lee as he scuttled into the area.

You can't put any points tally on this game and it was very emotional in the dressing room. I was close to tears; you don't know how to express your happiness.\" </p> <p>The same goes for grief. Newcastle could have won this 121st derby at a canter but harder still for their fans to comprehend was the lack of any plausible scapegoat. Last year they could hide behind Ruud Gullit's sacrilegious decision to leave Shearer on the bench, replacing him with the Mackem Paul Robinson. Fingers could even be pointed accusingly at the deluge that engulfed St James' Park on that miserable night when Sunderland, as on Saturday, came from a goal down to win. </p> <p>But this time the crestfallen manager was one of their own; the guilt-edged culprit the darling of Gallowgate. Bobby Robson, the usual spark in his eye eclipsed by disappointment, could hardly summon the words. \"I feel very low because I thought we would win this one. It's a horrible disappointment but this isn't the end of our season,\" he said. </p> <p>The visitors could have been swamped in Newcastle's riotous early attacks. After only 18 seconds Gary Speed found himself bearing down on goal, only for the ball to squirm awkwardly off his left boot. Sunderland, wheezing from the speed of the Geordie onslaught, were then floored as Nolberto Solano's cross was headed against a post by Speed. With Sorensen static and his defence in tatters, the midfielder prodded the ball over the line as he lay sprawled on the turf. The wave of attacks persisted with Clarence Acuna and Speed narrowly failing to convert a pair of Solano free-kicks. </p> <p>Pressed into action, the Sunderland manager Peter Reid gambled after 66 minutes by hauling off Chris Makin - the defender was inconsolable as he trudged off the field - in favour of the Argentine winger Julio Arca. The move could have backfired but instead it paid dividends to win the match. </p> <p>Within two minutes Kevin Phillips, turning inside Aaron Hughes, crossed for Don Hutchison to twist his body and smash a left-foot volley inside the post. For a split second there was jaw-dropping silence as even Hutchison, a Geordie, gauged exactly what had happened. Then the visiting fans exploded in raucous celebration. </p> <p>Newcastle's response was swift - Solano thumping the post with a 20-yard free-kick - but they were just as rattled and, after 76 minutes, behind. Another Solano attempt was blocked, Sunderland broke at speed with Alex Rae sliding the ball through to Michael Gray whose wonderful cross was met by a wondrous header from Quinn. </p> <p>\"It was entertaining and passionate,\" admitted Reid. \"We didn't get the credit we deserved last year but that was a great performance.

Winning the title looks beyond Liverpool this season and unless their defence stops dropping its guard, a place in next season's Champions League by finishing second or third will again pass them by. </p> <p>Yesterday Liverpool lost a match they initially looked well capable of winning because, in the words of their French manager G\u00e9rard Houllier, \"we made two childish defensive mistakes\". </p> <p>These errors saw Tottenham score twice in nine minutes towards the end of the first half after Robbie Fowler had given Liverpool the lead with his first league goal of the season. </p> <p>After that Houllier's team, for all their possession, did not regain the initiative in the face of tenacious and disciplined resistance by the youthful defence George Graham fielded in the absence of the injured Sol Campbell and the suspended Ben Thatcher. </p> <p>There is never a bad time to beat opposition of Liverpool's stature, and for Spurs the moment was especially opportune given the prospect of demonstrations by supporters disgruntled by what they see as a lack of progress in signing new players. Not for nothing did Graham observe that \"five of the players we had out there today were home grown\". </p> <p>For Houllier, Liverpool's repeated defensive lapses are all the more frustrating as they come after a season in which they were the most parsimonious opponents in the Premiership. And after this match it was clear that his patience was nearing exhaustion. </p> <p>While both of Tottenham's goals were avoidable, the first must have struck a raw Gallic nerve. Having taken the ball off Sergei Rebrov, Spurs' Ukrainian striker, near the corner flag, the Liverpool central defender St\u00e9phane Henchoz played it straight up the touchline to the advancing Stephen Clemence, who then received a return backheeled pass from Rebrov before centring low for Les Ferdinand to turn in the equaliser. </p> <p>\"When you are under pressure you don't try to pass the ball,\" Houllier grumbled, \"you clear it. This was not an 18-year-old, this was an international player. </p> <p>\"We've now conceded 21 goals in the league this season and 10 of them could have been avoided. And I think that in 11 of the 14 matches we've played we have scored first. Had we won all of those we would now have 33 points, the same as Manchester United. </p> <p>\"Until we solve this problem we will not be up there with the leaders. United scored in the first two minutes at Manchester City on Saturday and defended well enough to win. That is the difference between us.\" </p> <p>From Houllier's point of view Tottenham's second goal was hardly more forgivable. This time Liverpool's defence stood still, appealing for offside against Ferdinand, who was running back, as a long pass from Luke Young reached Clemence on the left. This time the midfielder's cross was high and true, and Tim Sherwood rose well to head the ball past Sander Westerveld. </p> <p>Relatively cheap though the goals were, they restored the confidence of a Spurs side starting to lose its way against Liverpool's superior passing and the efficiency with which Gary McAllister, Dietmar Hamann and Danny Murphy were denying Darren Anderton and Sherwood space in midfield. </p> <p>Once Fowler had scored, moreover, Tottenham's unbeaten home league record looked to be ending as Liverpool moved forward to settle the contest by half-time. Fowler's goal was typical of his style, a clinical left-footed shot low inside the right-hand post after Murphy had cleverly hooked a long ball from Hyypia into his path. </p> <p>Once behind, however, Liverpool rarely regained their rhythm, and after Neil Sullivan had pushed wide a shot from Owen at the start of the second half they came no closer. In fact Stephen Carr nearly extended Tottenham's lead after 67 minutes when his intended centre beat Westerveld and rebounded from the far post. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

For Houllier, Liverpool's repeated defensive lapses are all the more frustrating as they come after a season in which they were the most parsimonious opponents in the Premiership. And after this match it was clear that his patience was nearing exhaustion. While both of Tottenham's goals were avoidable, the first must have struck a raw Gallic nerve. Having taken the ball off Sergei Rebrov, Spurs' Ukrainian striker, near the corner flag, the Liverpool central defender St\u00e9phane Henchoz played it straight up the touchline to the advancing Stephen Clemence, who then received a return backheeled pass from Rebrov before centring low for Les Ferdinand to turn in the equaliser. \"When you are under pressure you don't try to pass the ball,\" Houllier grumbled, \"you clear it. This was not an 18-year-old, this was an international player. \"We've now conceded 21 goals in the league this season and 10 of them could have been avoided. And I think that in 11 of the 14 matches we've played we have scored first. Had we won all of those we would now have 33 points, the same as Manchester United. \"Until we solve this problem we will not be up there with the leaders. United scored in the first two minutes at Manchester City on Saturday and defended well enough to win. That is the difference between us.\" From Houllier's point of view Tottenham's second goal was hardly more forgivable. This time Liverpool's defence stood still, appealing for offside against Ferdinand, who was running back, as a long pass from Luke Young reached Clemence on the left. This time the midfielder's cross was high and true, and Tim Sherwood rose well to head the ball past Sander Westerveld. Relatively cheap though the goals were, they restored the confidence of a Spurs side starting to lose its way against Liverpool's superior passing and the efficiency with which Gary McAllister, Dietmar Hamann and Danny Murphy were denying Darren Anderton and Sherwood space in midfield. Once Fowler had scored, moreover, Tottenham's unbeaten home league record looked to be ending as Liverpool moved forward to settle the contest by half-time. Fowler's goal was typical of his style, a clinical left-footed shot low inside the right-hand post after Murphy had cleverly hooked a long ball from Hyypia into his path. Once behind, however, Liverpool rarely regained their rhythm, and after Neil Sullivan had pushed wide a shot from Owen at the start of the second half they came no closer. In fact Stephen Carr nearly extended Tottenham's lead after 67 minutes when his intended centre beat Westerveld and rebounded from the far post. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>For two minutes, about as long as their club president can go without offending someone, Radcliffe Borough dared to dream. Half an hour later, four down - and it should have been eight - for once in his life even Bernard Manning admitted he was speechless. </p> <p>So much for the romance of the Cup. At least the admirably vocal Radcliffe supporters, who had made the short journey to Bury's more accommodating ground, were disabused of hope quickly and so could relax and enjoy the occasion. </p> <p>\"We came with no intention of defending and sure enough, for most of the first half we didn't,\" said their manager Kevin Glendon. By the time his team twigged that they were in fact allowed to tackle, kick and mark the opposition just like a normal game, they were looking at a double-figure hiding. </p> <p>At least a determination not to be completely humiliated saw Radcliffe produce a second-half performance in which they could take pride. </p> <p>Ironically Borough had the first chance of the game, Simon Carden acrobatically volleying wide after just 90 seconds; 32 minutes later the skipper Mark Dempsey forced the City goalkeeper Alan Fettis to save well. In between they handed York the freedom of Gigg Lane. </p> <p>Perhaps a dozen times the visitors were given clear sight of goal and Graham Potter (unmarked left-foot volley from edge of area), Lee Bullock (unmarked header from cross), David McNiven (unmarked shot from 20 yards) and Scott Jordan (just unmarked) duly took advantage. </p> <p>The rest of the time, assorted York players contrived to hit the post, bar (twice) or somehow miss altogether. </p> <p>After the break, while York continued to create and miss chance after chance, Radcliffe created several opportunities of their own. Fettis again saved from Dempsey, before the striker Niell Hardy turned his marker on the edge of the area and scored 20 minutes from full-time. </p> <p>The dream may have been long forgotten, but the applause and more to the point, financial contribution, of a crowd some 25 times higher than average may persuade Manning to take the club, for which he is currently open to offers, off the market. </p> <p>\"If we could get just a tenth of these people to come every week there wouldn't be a problem,\" said the chairman Bernard Manning (Jr). </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "For two minutes, about as long as their club president can go without offending someone, Radcliffe Borough dared to dream. Half an hour later, four down - and it should have been eight - for once in his life even Bernard Manning admitted he was speechless. So much for the romance of the Cup. At least the admirably vocal Radcliffe supporters, who had made the short journey to Bury's more accommodating ground, were disabused of hope quickly and so could relax and enjoy the occasion. \"We came with no intention of defending and sure enough, for most of the first half we didn't,\" said their manager Kevin Glendon. By the time his team twigged that they were in fact allowed to tackle, kick and mark the opposition just like a normal game, they were looking at a double-figure hiding. At least a determination not to be completely humiliated saw Radcliffe produce a second-half performance in which they could take pride. Ironically Borough had the first chance of the game, Simon Carden acrobatically volleying wide after just 90 seconds; 32 minutes later the skipper Mark Dempsey forced the City goalkeeper Alan Fettis to save well. In between they handed York the freedom of Gigg Lane. Perhaps a dozen times the visitors were given clear sight of goal and Graham Potter (unmarked left-foot volley from edge of area), Lee Bullock (unmarked header from cross), David McNiven (unmarked shot from 20 yards) and Scott Jordan (just unmarked) duly took advantage. The rest of the time, assorted York players contrived to hit the post, bar (twice) or somehow miss altogether. After the break, while York continued to create and miss chance after chance, Radcliffe created several opportunities of their own. Fettis again saved from Dempsey, before the striker Niell Hardy turned his marker on the edge of the area and scored 20 minutes from full-time. The dream may have been long forgotten, but the applause and more to the point, financial contribution, of a crowd some 25 times higher than average may persuade Manning to take the club, for which he is currently open to offers, off the market. \"If we could get just a tenth of these people to come every week there wouldn't be a problem,\" said the chairman Bernard Manning (Jr). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Cardiff's revival under Alan Cork continued in spectacular style yesterday as Bristol Rovers of the Second Division were dumped out of the competition. </p> <p>A second-half hat-trick by the 19-year-old Robert Earnshaw extended their unbeaten run under the latest member of the former Crazy Gang to arrive in South Wales to six matches and what is more, Cardiff are doing it in a most un-Wimbledon-like way. </p> <p>Since the owner Sam Ham mam moved Bobby Gould upstairs and made Cork head coach six weeks ago, Cardiff have collected 11 points out of 15 by playing a passing game. Although he may have profited from long-ball tactics as a no-nonsense target man, Cork has virtually outlawed them at Ninian Park and yesterday the policy paid dividends. </p> <p>After falling behind early on, Cardiff refused to panic and were level by the break before overwhelming a lacklustre Rovers side with an impressive four-goal spell. </p> <p>\"I felt Earnie was below average today and I was thinking about taking him off before his second goal ,\" Cork revealed. </p> <p>\"As long as the boys keep being enthusiastic and wanting to pass the ball, we'll always score goals. Sam is driving me mad at the moment. He says he spent 14 years at Wimbledon teaching me how to elbow and kick people and now I've got people passing the ball!\" </p> <p>Since missing out on a play-off place by losing here in May, Rovers have declined. The strikers Jason Roberts and Jamie Cureton have gone and the team are now becalmed in the middle of the table. </p> <p>As his visibly shaken players boarded their coach, Ian Holloway could not hide his anger. \"That's the worst performance I've seen in my time as manager of Bristol Rovers,\" he admitted. \"It was 1-1 at half-time but we looked punchless and that's what happens when you keep selling your centre- forwards. I apologise to our supporters for that performance; it was absolutely awful.\" </p> <p>Rovers took the lead in the eighth minute when a cross by Vitalijs Astafjevs was headed into his own net by Andy Jordan. It was hardly the best way for the 19-year-old defender to start his first full game since arriving from the other team in Bristol last month. </p> <p>Cardiff equalised seven minutes later when Nick Culkin failed to hold Andy Legg's long throw-in and Keith Evans hooked the ball in from 10 yards. Six minutes after the break Evans sent in Earnshaw and, as Culkin rushed out, the diminutive striker slipped the ball into the far corner. </p> <p>On 71 minutes, Fortune-West headed in a Legg corner and soon after Josh Low capped a fine performance by setting up Earnshaw for his second, this time rounding Culkin before sliding home. Fortune-West nodded for the Welsh Under-21 striker to complete his hat-trick with a precise finish from 16 yards nine minutes from time. </p> <p>Having not watched Cardiff's resurgence under Cork, the superstitious Gould decided to stay away yesterday. And Hammam, after acknowledging fans' chants from his usual position alongside the dugout, may well be tempted to impose a permanent ban on the former Wales manager - don't put it past him. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

A second-half hat-trick by the 19-year-old Robert Earnshaw extended their unbeaten run under the latest member of the former Crazy Gang to arrive in South Wales to six matches and what is more, Cardiff are doing it in a most un-Wimbledon-like way. Since the owner Sam Ham mam moved Bobby Gould upstairs and made Cork head coach six weeks ago, Cardiff have collected 11 points out of 15 by playing a passing game. Although he may have profited from long-ball tactics as a no-nonsense target man, Cork has virtually outlawed them at Ninian Park and yesterday the policy paid dividends. After falling behind early on, Cardiff refused to panic and were level by the break before overwhelming a lacklustre Rovers side with an impressive four-goal spell. \"I felt Earnie was below average today and I was thinking about taking him off before his second goal ,\" Cork revealed. \"As long as the boys keep being enthusiastic and wanting to pass the ball, we'll always score goals. Sam is driving me mad at the moment. He says he spent 14 years at Wimbledon teaching me how to elbow and kick people and now I've got people passing the ball!\" Since missing out on a play-off place by losing here in May, Rovers have declined. The strikers Jason Roberts and Jamie Cureton have gone and the team are now becalmed in the middle of the table. As his visibly shaken players boarded their coach, Ian Holloway could not hide his anger. \"That's the worst performance I've seen in my time as manager of Bristol Rovers,\" he admitted. \"It was 1-1 at half-time but we looked punchless and that's what happens when you keep selling your centre- forwards. I apologise to our supporters for that performance; it was absolutely awful.\" Rovers took the lead in the eighth minute when a cross by Vitalijs Astafjevs was headed into his own net by Andy Jordan. It was hardly the best way for the 19-year-old defender to start his first full game since arriving from the other team in Bristol last month. Cardiff equalised seven minutes later when Nick Culkin failed to hold Andy Legg's long throw-in and Keith Evans hooked the ball in from 10 yards. Six minutes after the break Evans sent in Earnshaw and, as Culkin rushed out, the diminutive striker slipped the ball into the far corner. On 71 minutes, Fortune-West headed in a Legg corner and soon after Josh Low capped a fine performance by setting up Earnshaw for his second, this time rounding Culkin before sliding home. Fortune-West nodded for the Welsh Under-21 striker to complete his hat-trick with a precise finish from 16 yards nine minutes from time. Having not watched Cardiff's resurgence under Cork, the superstitious Gould decided to stay away yesterday. And Hammam, after acknowledging fans' chants from his usual position alongside the dugout, may well be tempted to impose a permanent ban on the former Wales manager - don't put it past him. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But I detected a new level of excitement over City-United. The Hollywood-style trailers, running all week - Return of the Jedi, Batman ... And Now the Most Eagerly Awaited Sequel of All - were something to behold. </p> <p>Soccer AM's take on the match was leavened, I am pleased to say, with a touch more irony. Sitting on the sofa beside the bass guitarist Mani, who represented the red half of Manchester, was the City fan Noel Gallagher of Oasis, who in his cool, semi-detached way, seemed to be as bang up for it as anyone. </p> <p>Soccer AM, which I switch on most Saturday mornings prepared to scoff at the posing and mugging of the presenters Tim Lovejoy and Helen Chamberlain, invariably ends up entertaining me hugely. It is children's television, I suppose, but in the tradition of the genre, there is plenty there for mums and dads, and the tone of voice remains more or less adult. </p> <p>This is not an easy trick to pull off, as BBC1's Football Fever on a Sunday morning is proving. Football Fever is clearly aimed at a similar audience to Soccer AM, with Matt Smith and Katy Hill standing in for Tim and Helen, but fails dismally to cut the mustard. There is nothing inherently wrong with the material - the jokes are not very funny but a lot of those on Soccer AM are not either - but Matt and Katy are trying far too hard. </p> <p>The kind of connection with the audience Soccer AM manages is not achieved overnight. It will not happen for Football Fever without a good, long run and without some more adult features (obviously not in any top-shelf sense of the word) out of which the humour can grow organically. My guess is that Football Fever will disappear from the schedules before any of that occurs. A new vehicle should be found for Matt Smith, though, who is nearly as relaxed as Tim Lovejoy without being quite so \"involved with himself\", as the Americans might put it. </p> <p>One of the secrets of Soccer AM is the quality of its guests, selected from a rarely changing cast list. Neil Ruddock is a regular: \"always revealing something that's going to make the papers,\" according to Tim. His revelation this week was that he had decided to retire from international football to spend more time with his family. </p> <p>Mani has also been on the show a time or two, as has Noel, so both had an easy familiarity with Tim and Helen. \"I know you're rivals,\" said Tim, \"but do you still like to get together for the craic?\" \"I haven't done drugs for two years,\" protested Oasis's cheeky chappie. When Tim expressed mock outrage at their casual style of dress, Noel said they had decided to dress like a carpet fitter and a plasterer - my thoughts exactly - so they would not be confused with a boy band. </p> <p>Mani, who helped officiate over the draw for the LDV Vans Trophy - n\u00e9e the Auto Windscreens Cup - was described by Noel as \"the drinking man's Ted Croker,\" a joke I suspect which flew straight over the head of the show's mostly young audience but still drew a chuckle from the young ones round my place. </p> <p>This, I think, is exactly the tone for which this sort of programme should be striving. Meanwhile regular features such as the five-minute phone-in, the Third Eye and Feed The Goat (don't ask), keep the show rattling along. The production team is to be congratulated on the finest show of its type since the heyday of Fantasy Football. </p> <p> In a way this sort of programme helps put football in its place, unlike the irony-free zone that is Sky Soccer. It seemed odd moving straight from Mani and Noel to the match itself, the title sequence for which made the trailer for Jaws appear a model of restraint. \"It's been a long time, too long,\" intoned the announcer over portentous music. \"It is a city awash with red and blue. Today, as the tides come together, at last the wait is over. One city united.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is planning to expose a paedophile tonight in an extraordinary undercover investigation by Newsnight. In a disturbing documentary, a young woman uses secret cameras to confront her abuser and members of the paedophile ring into which she and other members of her family were sold. The Newsnight special has been six months in the planning but has been kept a strict secret for fear of reprisals and injunctions. It has been made with the co-operation of the victims of the abuse as well as participation of organisations working with the victims. The programme also includes an interview with the alleged abuser. The decision to go ahead with tonight's Newsnight film was taken after legal advice and approval from BBC2 controller Jane Root and head of editorial policy Phil Harding. Newsnight's special investigation highlights how the public and media's pre-occupation with paedophiles snatching young children masks the reality that most child abuse occurs within the home or amongst family and friends. The programme will also cause clashes with the police and social services who come in for criticism.",

Established business will be housed alongside new start-ups in an enterprise that could mean 14,000 new jobs within three years.</p> <p>Mr Bourne said: \"We are very pleased to be given the preferred bidder status. We've worked very hard on our offer and we are delighted the government has awarded it to us.\"</p> <p>Asked if they had forced the government into the move by threatening to withdraw their bid, Mr Bourne said: \"Both ourselves and the government wanted to come to a decision as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\"Obviously the governmnet have a huge investment in the dome and these things take time. We have been patient and our patience has been rewarded.\"</p> <p>He said that his company's creation - to be known as Knowledge City - would aim to become \"one of the world's leading centres of innovation and excellence in the fields of high technologies, e-commerce and bio-science, so that the Dome can become a real symbol of Enterprise Britain\".</p> <p>Legacy said that Knowledge City had the support of such organisations as BT, the London Business School and the Open University.</p> <p>David James, the chief executive of the dome, said there would now be a period of \"detailed negotiaions with Legacy on the terms attached\" which would hopefully be completed by February next year.</p> <p>He said a formal exchange of contracts would then follow and that after the dome closes at the end of the year, the decommissioning process would begin as expected.</p> <p>Asked if he thought Legacy may bulldoze the super-structure of the dome, which is not built to last indefinitely, Mr James said: \"I am certain they are not and that would be part of the acceptable terms.\"</p> <p>Mr Bourne said: \"We have built into our business plans maintaining its fabric. Our plan is a long-term plan which will see \u00a3150m invested over three years.\"</p> <p>And Mr Bourne added: \"There is an opportunity to move a number of companies in quite early on in the process. The dome itself will be decommissioned and that process will last until May-June next year.</p> <p>\"But there is space outside the main part of the dome where we can accommodate companies from as early as the spring of next year.\"</p> <p>Asked if Legacy's plans would suffer from negative stigma surrounding the dome, Mr Bourne said: \"No, not at all.

      "bodyText": "The government today named the Legacy company, which wants to turn the Millennium Dome into a hi-tech business centre, as its preferred bidder for the attraction. The firm, headed by Labour party-supporting property entrepreneur Robert Bourne, had threatened to pull out of the deal unless a favourable government response was not forthcoming soon. Now, with the dome closing to the public at the end of the year, the attraction's immediate future seems secure. Legacy wants to create a business mini-city within the dome, in Greenwich, south-east London. Established business will be housed alongside new start-ups in an enterprise that could mean 14,000 new jobs within three years. Mr Bourne said: \"We are very pleased to be given the preferred bidder status. We've worked very hard on our offer and we are delighted the government has awarded it to us.\" Asked if they had forced the government into the move by threatening to withdraw their bid, Mr Bourne said: \"Both ourselves and the government wanted to come to a decision as quickly as possible. \"Obviously the governmnet have a huge investment in the dome and these things take time. We have been patient and our patience has been rewarded.\" He said that his company's creation - to be known as Knowledge City - would aim to become \"one of the world's leading centres of innovation and excellence in the fields of high technologies, e-commerce and bio-science, so that the Dome can become a real symbol of Enterprise Britain\". Legacy said that Knowledge City had the support of such organisations as BT, the London Business School and the Open University. David James, the chief executive of the dome, said there would now be a period of \"detailed negotiaions with Legacy on the terms attached\" which would hopefully be completed by February next year. He said a formal exchange of contracts would then follow and that after the dome closes at the end of the year, the decommissioning process would begin as expected. Asked if he thought Legacy may bulldoze the super-structure of the dome, which is not built to last indefinitely, Mr James said: \"I am certain they are not and that would be part of the acceptable terms.\" Mr Bourne said: \"We have built into our business plans maintaining its fabric. Our plan is a long-term plan which will see \u00a3150m invested over three years.\" And Mr Bourne added: \"There is an opportunity to move a number of companies in quite early on in the process. The dome itself will be decommissioned and that process will last until May-June next year. \"But there is space outside the main part of the dome where we can accommodate companies from as early as the spring of next year.\" Asked if Legacy's plans would suffer from negative stigma surrounding the dome, Mr Bourne said: \"No, not at all. It is a great opportunity and the dome is an icon, a fantastic structure. The investment in the infrastructure of the dome gives us a great head start.\" Legacy had finished second to the Dome Europe consortium in the competition to take over the site at the end of this year. But, backed by Japanese finance group Nomura, Dome Europe pulled out in September as the full extent of the dome's financial crisis became apparent. The government then turned to Legacy again, but the company had grown increasingly frustrated by the delay in getting the official green light for its bid. Last week, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, headed a meeting where ministers heard a report on the Legacy bid from regeneration agency English Partnerships which owns the Dome site. Despite Legacy initially saying they would \"regretfully withdraw\" if no favourable decision was made by the end of last week, Mr Prescott said more time was needed to study the bid. Legacy responded by retreating from its earlier stance, saying it was happy to give the government a few more days. Ministers are still reeling from the political embarrassment caused by the dome's financial flop caused by far-lower-than-expected visitor numbers. The extent of the mismanagement by all concerned was highlighted in this month's report by government spending watchdog body, the National Audit Office. News of the preferred bid came in a parliamentary written answer given by Hilary Armstrong, the minister for local government and the regions. She said: \"Legacy has been awarded preferred bidder status because they have confirmed that they will resolve all outstanding contractual issues within an agreed timetable. \"Negotiations will continue and if all goes well we expect to exchange contracts during February. Progress will be reviewed regularly. English Partnerships will be working closely with Legacy to agree a masterplan for the dome and associated land.\" Ms Armstrong added that English Partnerships and Greenwich council were working together to put in place a new partnership for the next stage of the regeneration of the Greenwich peninsula. Lord Falconer, the government minister with responsibility for the Dome, said tonight: \"Though much work has to be done before negotiations can be completed, Legacy's plans offer a high-quality, high-tech and exciting future for the dome, for Londoners and especially the people of Greenwich. \"The dome has proved to be the top pay-to-visit tourist attractions in this country and has acted as a catalyst for the regeneration of what was a poisoned peninsula, scarred by hundreds of acres of wasteland.\" Related stories Press release - government 15 November, leader: Don't dump the dome Audio Audio: David Hencke (3mins 10) Useful links Key player: New Millennium Experience Company Key player: Legacy Key player: Department for Culture, Media and Sport National Audit Office dome report (PDF file) Commons select committee report Greenwich 2000",

As questionnaires this weekend showed, Spain's younger generations see Franco merely as \"a thing of the past\". There are new heroes to worship now: men like Rivaldo, Figo and Mendieta. And McManaman. </p> <p>It's true - reports of Macca's footballing death have been greatly exaggerated. Real Madrid's Scouse superstar has played four games on the trot, and this weekend he was the toast of the football press after Madrid's 1-0 win away at giant killers Villarreal. It was Macca whose, admittedly tame, cross ex-Barca man (double the fun) Guillermo Amor turned past his own keeper to secure victory for Vicente Del Bosque's side. </p> <p>Madrid sports daily AS was even kind enough to declare it: \"Macca's goal with some help from Amor\". But it's off the field where MacManaman is really winning them over. To judge by the Spanish press, Macca, who didn't complain \"and asked for nothing but respect\" when the club shunned him during the summer, is the very incarnation of the perfect English gentleman. It's nice to know that it's not just the Sun and the Mail that indulge in comforting national stereotypes.</p> <p>McManaman's \"goal\" was all the more valuable for the failure of Valencia and Deportivo to collect all three points. The top two both played poorly and drew 1-1. Valencia in Vitoria against Alav\u00e9s, and Depor down the road in Pamplona against Osasuna. </p> <p>Scaloni headed the season's fastest goal - 17 seconds - to give Depor the perfect start, but the current champions couldn't capitalise and Cruchaga equalised 15 minutes later. Meanwhile Valencia came from behind against Alav\u00e9s, with the awkward but strangely effective John Carew finishing off Mendieta's pass.</p> <p>Things only continue to get worse for Barcelona however - this time it was Zaragoza who beat them 3-0. Three goals in 15 minutes either side of half time were enough to sink a Bar\u00e7a side looking desperately short of ideas up front and comically awful at the back. This goalkeeping hilarity just runs and runs - this time it was Arnau's turn. A backpass from Petit wasn't even dangerous - not that is, until Arnau decided he could play a bit and ended up gifting Zaragoza their second. </p> <p>Up in the director's box, Joan Gaspart, who afterwards said there was \"no reasonable excuse\" for Bar\u00e7a's performance could barely watch. Not surprising. What is surprising is that Gaspart continues to support Lorenzo Serra Ferrer and that poll on Catalan TV this weekend suggested that only 50 per cent of the cul\u00e9s want him to go. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Rayo Vallecano moved into a Champions League place with a 4-2 home win against M\u00e1laga, with Bolo, Bolic, Bartelt and Bravo (as in Juliet) getting the goals. There were four goals, too, for Real Sociedad at home to Numancia (4-1), and Oviedo against Valladoilid (4-1). </p> <p>Las Palmas ended Mallorca's five game unbeaten run with a comfortable 1-0 win in the Canary Islands, and Racing scored late on to secure a 1-1 draw with Celta in Vigo. Meanwhile Rangers must be kicking themselves - Raul Tamudo scored again as Espanyol secured a 2-1 win against Athletic Bilbao, taking them to tenth in the table. </p> <p>Among all the additional column inches on Franco this weekend was the revelation that the dictator didn't support Real Madrid after all. Not that that's likely to have any effect on the club's membership - these days even Madrid's right-wing Ultras have long-since transferred their loyalties to Raul and co.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Internet giant Yahoo has been ordered to ban French web users from accessing its English-language sites that sell Nazi memorabilia. In what French authorities are hailing as a landmark ruling, Yahoo has been given 90 days to stop French internet traffic from straying into prohibited territory. Under French law, Yahoo can be fined F100,000 for each day it exceeds the deadline, if the company ignores the judgement. The case, prompted by a short-lived auction of Nazi memorabilia on Yahoo.fr, will have far-reaching implications for international internet law. It was brought by the Paris-based International League against Racism &amp; Anti-Semitism (LICRA) and the Union of French Jewish Students (UEJF). A third French anti-racist group, MRAP, joined the action at a later stage. The organisation used French law, which bans the sale of Nazi memorabilia, to get the site closed down. However, they pursued the case to the courts in a bid to establish a precedent that would stop users in one country gaining access to illegal material in another. While Yahoo's French-language portal, Yahoo.fr, does not host such auctions, French internet users, like all others, can move over to Yahoo.com and come across memorabilia such as Nazi books, daggers, SS badges and uniforms. Yahoo's defence was that its English-language Yahoo.com services are US-governed and that auctions of Nazi material cannot be barred because of US constitutional rights to freedom of speech. The ruling could have repercussion on other big US internet businesses that tap into local markets, especially Amazon.com and eBay, which dallies in consumer-to-consumer auctions.",

      "bodyText": "Recruitment to teacher training has risen for the first time in eight years, according to government figures published today. Ministers hope the figures - which appear to show the impact of new training salaries as well as more opportunities for on the job training - will quash the Tories' claims of a deepening teacher recruitment crisis. Nevertheless they still reveal that while targets in the primary sector have again been met, there is a 13% shortfall of trainees required to fill jobs in secondary schools. The latest figures published by the teacher training agency (TTA) show that 28,000 trainee teachers have been recruited. The rise means that there are now more than 2,000 more new trainees than the same time last year. Overall there has been an 8% rise, with a 14% increase in graduates. There has also been an increase in the number of graduate recruits to shortage subjects - technology, modern languages, science and maths. Labour inherited declining recruitment from the Tories and has since introduced a series of measures intended to make teaching and training, more attractive. These include performance-related pay for teachers, as well as the new training salaries and \"golden hellos\" of \u00a34,000 for post-graduates training in shortage subjects. The government has succeeded in attracting the 13,000 trainees it needs to meet its targets in the primary sector, but there is a 13% shortfall in meeting the targets for secondary schools. There, it has attracted 14,508 trainees compared with the 16,615 it needs. Drop-out rates for trainees also remain high, with many failing to enter the classroom once they are qualified. The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, said: \"We welcome these figures but cannot be complacent. We know that schools are still finding it hard to recruit the teachers they need in subjects such as maths and physics because of the hugely competitive labour market for such specialisms. Areas like London and the south-east are especially tough when graduates may have an even wider range of careers to choose from.\" Publication of the new figures comes three weeks after the TTA launched a recruitment drive, backed by a \u00a37m advertising campaign on television and in newspapers. Ralph Tabberer, chief executive of the TTA, said: \"It is a competitive market and we are not complacent about the need to attract many more high quality people into the profession.\" The shadow education secretary, Theresa May, said: \"No matter what they are saying about the past, it is the future that counts.

      "body": "<p>The differences in Florida vote totals remain paper-thin today as lawyers for Al Gore and George W Bush prepare to argue before the state's supreme court over a manual recount of punch ballots that could determine America's next president.</p> <p>Republicans want to stop the ongoing hand recounts in three heavily Democratic counties. Democrats, looking for new votes to whittle down Bush's 930-vote lead, are fighting to get them included in the final official tally. The court is expected to begin hearing the legal arguments at 7pm GMT today.</p> <p>Around six million votes were cast overall in make-or-break Florida. A weekend tally of overseas absentee ballots has stretched Mr Bush's official lead. However, uncompleted hand recounts over the weekend in Broward and Palm Beach counties cut it slightly to 834 votes as of midnight Sunday.</p> <p>The hand counting resumed today in Palm Beach County, to be followed later in the morning by Broward, while Miami-Dade County was expected to begin its hand tally.</p> <p>Mr Gore narrowly won the nationwide popular vote and holds a slight edge over Mr Bush in the all-important electoral college tally. But neither candidate will reach the required 270 electoral votes to be declared the nation's 43rd president without Florida's 25 electors.</p> <p>Prospects for an abrupt end to the election deadlock are highly uncertain. Mr Gore's allies are not ruling out pressing ahead on other fronts if the state supreme court does not support them.</p> <p>Floridian Democratic senator Bob Graham, who is close to the Gore campaign, said today that the state's entire vote should be counted again by hand. \"What we're trying to achieve here is an election that has credibility by the American people. That credibility would likely be enhanced if all Florida voters had their ballots hand counted,\" he said.</p> <p>Both candidates maintained low profiles yesterday, with each going for a run and then to church. Meanwhile, their lawyers filed legal briefs with the Florida supreme court, which had ruled on Saturday that Florida's controversial secretary of state, Katherine Harris, could not certify the state results until the court decided whether to allow the hand recounts to be included.</p> <p>Mr Bush's lawyers said it would be unfair \"to keep the state and the nation on hold\" during interminable recounts while Mr Gore's attorneys argued for some counties to get more time to complete hand tallies.</p> <p>Ms Harris, a Republican activist, tried to distance herself from the presidential rivals. Mr Gore's supporters pointed to her campaigning for Mr Bush as a sign of bias. Ms Harris said in separate court filing: \"It is clear, that for the Democrats and the Republicans, the object is to win, and that is understandable. The stakes are very high.\"</p> <p>Mr Gore's legal team asked the court to set a generous standard for officials to \"ascertain the electorate's will\" when ballots were punched in the disputed presidential election. They said local election officials in close cases can \"determine the voter's intent\" by closely examining the ballot.</p> <p>The Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joseph Lieberman, said: \"It seems to be that they're doing everything they can to stop the recounting of votes because they're slightly ahead and they fear that after the recounting they won't be.\"</p> <p>In Broward County, Mr Gore's count by Sunday night showed a net gain of 108 votes, with more than two-thirds of the 609 precincts counted.

      "bodyText": "The differences in Florida vote totals remain paper-thin today as lawyers for Al Gore and George W Bush prepare to argue before the state's supreme court over a manual recount of punch ballots that could determine America's next president. Republicans want to stop the ongoing hand recounts in three heavily Democratic counties. Democrats, looking for new votes to whittle down Bush's 930-vote lead, are fighting to get them included in the final official tally. The court is expected to begin hearing the legal arguments at 7pm GMT today. Around six million votes were cast overall in make-or-break Florida. A weekend tally of overseas absentee ballots has stretched Mr Bush's official lead. However, uncompleted hand recounts over the weekend in Broward and Palm Beach counties cut it slightly to 834 votes as of midnight Sunday. The hand counting resumed today in Palm Beach County, to be followed later in the morning by Broward, while Miami-Dade County was expected to begin its hand tally. Mr Gore narrowly won the nationwide popular vote and holds a slight edge over Mr Bush in the all-important electoral college tally. But neither candidate will reach the required 270 electoral votes to be declared the nation's 43rd president without Florida's 25 electors. Prospects for an abrupt end to the election deadlock are highly uncertain. Mr Gore's allies are not ruling out pressing ahead on other fronts if the state supreme court does not support them. Floridian Democratic senator Bob Graham, who is close to the Gore campaign, said today that the state's entire vote should be counted again by hand. \"What we're trying to achieve here is an election that has credibility by the American people. That credibility would likely be enhanced if all Florida voters had their ballots hand counted,\" he said. Both candidates maintained low profiles yesterday, with each going for a run and then to church. Meanwhile, their lawyers filed legal briefs with the Florida supreme court, which had ruled on Saturday that Florida's controversial secretary of state, Katherine Harris, could not certify the state results until the court decided whether to allow the hand recounts to be included. Mr Bush's lawyers said it would be unfair \"to keep the state and the nation on hold\" during interminable recounts while Mr Gore's attorneys argued for some counties to get more time to complete hand tallies. Ms Harris, a Republican activist, tried to distance herself from the presidential rivals. Mr Gore's supporters pointed to her campaigning for Mr Bush as a sign of bias. Ms Harris said in separate court filing: \"It is clear, that for the Democrats and the Republicans, the object is to win, and that is understandable. The stakes are very high.\" Mr Gore's legal team asked the court to set a generous standard for officials to \"ascertain the electorate's will\" when ballots were punched in the disputed presidential election. They said local election officials in close cases can \"determine the voter's intent\" by closely examining the ballot. The Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joseph Lieberman, said: \"It seems to be that they're doing everything they can to stop the recounting of votes because they're slightly ahead and they fear that after the recounting they won't be.\" In Broward County, Mr Gore's count by Sunday night showed a net gain of 108 votes, with more than two-thirds of the 609 precincts counted. Set aside for the time being were ballots with tiny pieces of paper in the punch-card. Republicans had accused Broward's three-member canvassing board of bowing to political pressure from Democrats in undoing a decision to throw out ballots that did not have two corners poked out of the punch-hole. Ed Pozzuoli, a Republican, said: \"The Gore campaign now wants to lower the bar because it needs more votes.\" Democrats said the ruling allows voters' intentions to be noted. Democratic attorney Charles Lichtman said: \"These chad marks didn't get on the ballot by osmosis.\" Miami-Dade County mechanically sorted ballots by machine yesterday in preparation for beginning its hand count. Mr Bush's attorneys protested the action, saying it would alter the delicate ballots, but a circuit judge gave the go-ahead.

      "body": "<p>World leaders gathered in the Netherlands today at the start of the ministerial negotiating round of vital talks aimed at curbing climate change. </p> <p>The meeting, which began last week at a preliminary level, is in deadlock after a long-running argument between the US and Europe. Environment ministers from at least 150 countries have arrived in the Hague with the aim of overcoming this.</p> <p>An agreement reached in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, called for a worldwide reduction of emissions of carbon-based gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels during the five-year target period of 2008-2012. Europe is committed to cutting emissions by 8%, Japan by 6%, the US by 7%. </p> <p>However US negotiators want to trade their requirement to cut emissions against lower-than-expected pollution from Russia and the developing world. </p> <p>On Thursday, the European Union rejected a US proposal which would enable it to meet half its Kyoto target without reducing emissions. </p> <p>This morning Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands appeared at the Congress Centre at the Hague before speeches by French president Jacques Chirac and Dutch premier Wim Kok. Britain's deputy prime minister John Prescott, who is leading the UK delegation, is due to make a keynote address to the conference tomorrow. </p> <p>Mr Prescott is expected to underline how flooding, which in past weeks has devastated properties and farmland in the south of England, the Midlands and Yorkshire, has brought home to Britons the urgency of the situation. Yesterday, he acknowledged that there were differences between Europe and the US, though he held out hope that a compromise could be reached. \"I wait and see what their final negotiating position is before I come to a conclusion.

      "bodyText": "World leaders gathered in the Netherlands today at the start of the ministerial negotiating round of vital talks aimed at curbing climate change. The meeting, which began last week at a preliminary level, is in deadlock after a long-running argument between the US and Europe. Environment ministers from at least 150 countries have arrived in the Hague with the aim of overcoming this. An agreement reached in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, called for a worldwide reduction of emissions of carbon-based gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels during the five-year target period of 2008-2012. Europe is committed to cutting emissions by 8%, Japan by 6%, the US by 7%. However US negotiators want to trade their requirement to cut emissions against lower-than-expected pollution from Russia and the developing world. On Thursday, the European Union rejected a US proposal which would enable it to meet half its Kyoto target without reducing emissions. This morning Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands appeared at the Congress Centre at the Hague before speeches by French president Jacques Chirac and Dutch premier Wim Kok. Britain's deputy prime minister John Prescott, who is leading the UK delegation, is due to make a keynote address to the conference tomorrow. Mr Prescott is expected to underline how flooding, which in past weeks has devastated properties and farmland in the south of England, the Midlands and Yorkshire, has brought home to Britons the urgency of the situation. Yesterday, he acknowledged that there were differences between Europe and the US, though he held out hope that a compromise could be reached. \"I wait and see what their final negotiating position is before I come to a conclusion. I do think you can get an agreement ... There are some signs that some give is coming in this situation,\" he said. Margot Wallstrom, the EU commissioner on the environment, argued that it was not too late to preserve the environment, but stressed that the time had come for decisive action. Asked whether she felt that America was the \"villain of the piece\", Ms Wallstrom said: \"It would be absurd if the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases would not sign the Kyoto Protocol, or ratify it.\" There has been speculation that US president Bill Clinton may decide to attend the Hague talks on his way back from a trip to Vietnam.

      "bodyText": "ITV bosses are furious with suggestions that they have dumbed down the questions on tonight's Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in a concerted attempt to kill off the BBC in the ratings. Suspicions were immediately raised about the quality of questions when reports emerged that someone will win the \u00a31m jackpot for the first time in the two-year history of the show. The BBC believes it is more than just coincidence that a millionaire emerges because tonight's episode is scheduled head-to-head with the last ever episode of One Foot in the Grave. But sources at ITV have pointed out that the Chris Tarrant quiz show has actually strengthened its lead over the BBC sitcom over the last five weeks. One source said: \"It is a great shame to see the BBC reacting with such cynicism. Who Wants to be a Millionaire? has been winning the ratings battle with One Foot in the Grave for weeks now. They are both great British programmes. Why can't the BBC just accept that Millionaire is hugely popular without these unpleasant and unfounded attacks.\" Five weeks ago when One Foot in the Grave began it was neck and neck with Millionaire with 10.2m viewers. But by week two One Foot in the Grave was trailing by 1m viewers and by last week the gap had widened to 2.4m. Celador, the maker of the quiz show, was due to hold a press conference at 2.30pm giving reporters the first chance to meet winner Judith Keppel, a 58-year-old garden designer from Fulham. She impressed viewers immediately after she emerged as the only one to correctly answer the fastest finger first round which involved putting four prime ministers in chronological order. ITV only confirmed Ms Keppel's victory at lunchtime, under pressure from reporters. 'We are very disappointed that news of this win has leaked in advance of transmission origin. We really wanted to keep it a secret so as not to spoil viewers' enjoyment of the programme,\" said the spokeswoman.",

Chief executive Kelly Moulton has been replaced by operations, business development and marketing director Simon Walker, and the games and diaries editors have both been made redundant. A number of technical staff have also lost their jobs, although new CEO Mr Walker said these staff were all contractors brought in to set up the website. \"You don't keep the builders around when they've built the house do you?\" he said. Explaining the reason for the two editorial redundancies, Mr Walker said PeopleNews was rejigging the site so that the diaries and games channels could be integrated more into the rest of the site. He said the two channels didn't work well as separate entities and would be dropping into the news sections of the site. \"It's all about getting the right people doing the right things,\" explained Mr Walker. \"Sources close to the latest developments questioned the given explanation, saying they had been told the cut-backs were part of a cost-saving exercise and that a lot of money had already been spent. Mr Walker denied that PeopleNews would be the next dot.com disaster and maintained that the site had \"plenty of money left\". He said the next step would be to pull in big sponsorship deals and boost ad sales across the site. A number of content distribution deals are to be announced in December and a deal with a digital TV company to run a PeopleNews branded short daily slot is in the pipeline. Mr Walker said PeopleNews was on track to rack up 45,000 unique users by the end of the year, having already pulled in 20,000 unique users since launch.

The decision to appoint General Rainer Schuwirth as chief of staff and General Graham Messervy-Whiting as his deputy came as unpleasant and thoroughly unexpected news in Paris and will be seen as something of a put-down here for the country that, together with Britain, pioneered the historic plans for a joint EU military capability. But it may well have been unavoidable given the strong misgivings in Whitehall and Washington about France's precise intentions with the 60,000-strong EU force, which is due to be in place by 2003 and will be deployed if Nato as a whole does not want to get involved in a new crisis in, for example, the Balkans or Africa. From the outset at the Franco-British St Malo conference two years ago, warnings have come thick and fast from British conservatives - a notably strident Lady Thatcher among them - that the creation of a self-sufficient European defence capability was all part of a deliberate French strategy to weaken Nato. \"The real drive towards a separate European defence is the same as that towards a single European currency - namely the Utopian venture of creating a single European super-state to rival the US on the world stage,\" Lady Thatcher said last year. Britain, she said, in a sentiment shared by many in the British eurosceptic camp, should be extremely wary of any move to lever it away from a strictly US-led Nato strategy in support of France's \"long-standing ambition to end US military hegemony in Europe\". More recently, British officials in Brussels confirmed they feared an attempt by president Jacques Chirac to push EU defence too far away from Nato, and Alexander Vershbow, the US ambassador to Nato, warned of \"new political frictions in the transatlantic relationship\" if the EU created a planning unit for its fledgling defence policy. The exact terms of Nato's relationship with the new EU military capability, most particularly in terms of strategy, planning and information-gathering, is at the heart of the disagreement, which will prove difficult to resolve before the proposed deadline of next month's Nice summit that close France EU presidency. Officials involved in negotiations so far have often complained privately that France has tried to keep Nato \"at arm's length\", and are worried that the Nice summit could adopt proposals leading to the sort of duplication of strategic resources that the North Atlantic alliance insists must be avoided. While most European Nato members want the EU to have access to Nato planning so as to avoid the risk that Brussels will create its own intelligence organisation, Paris, for so long ambivalent if not downright hostile to involvement with Nato, is keen for the EU to do just that - in opposition to London, which remains influenced by Britain's traditional ties with the US in the intelligence field. \"It is often said that Nato has top-level strategic resources that should not be duplicated,\" said France's defence minister, Alain Richard, recently. \"But in fact, these are basically American national resources.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is a \"huge distance\" between the US and the European Union after the first week of talks between 160 countries trying to negotiate a legally binding agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions, it was warned yesterday. </p> <p>Jan Pronk, the Dutch environment minister and president of the conference, said: \"We have made no progress in the first week. The only good thing to say is we are no further apart.\" </p> <p>Mr Pronk had just been briefing John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, who with more than 100 politicians from around the world arrived in the Hague yesterday to take over from his officials for the final week of talks. </p> <p>Mr Prescott was more optimistic. \"There are difficult areas and all sorts of stumbling blocks but I do not think it is impossible. This is still Sunday, not Wednesday or Thursday... We all must find agreement, we will be unforgiven if we have not found agreement by the end of the week.\" </p> <p>The talks are expected to deliver greenhouse gas reduction targets for the developed world of 5% by 2010, but each country has a widely different target and different ideas of how to reach it. Mr Prescott said that in Kyoto when the original agreement for reductions was reached the EU had wanted 15% and the US 0%. \"No one thought we would make a deal there but we did,\" he said. </p> <p>The US has been widely criticised for not taking domestic action to cut fossil fuel emissions. Instead it is claiming credit for removing carbon from the atmosphere by encouraging tree growth, changing farming practices and growing energy crops to burn in power stations. It claims that by managing existing forests properly it saves 300m tonnes of carbon a year - about half the US emissions. </p> <p>If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a new global code of behaviour on emissions will require ratification by most of the industrial countries. Without a US endorsement, it would be difficult for such a treaty to come into force. The US Senate has passed a resolution making its ratification conditional on assurances that US competitiveness on world markets will not be harmed. </p> <p>Although the focus has been on the row between the so-called umbrella group - the US, Japan, Russia, Canada, Australia , New Zealand - and the EU, little has been heard of the role of developing countries.

      "bodyText": "There is a \"huge distance\" between the US and the European Union after the first week of talks between 160 countries trying to negotiate a legally binding agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions, it was warned yesterday. Jan Pronk, the Dutch environment minister and president of the conference, said: \"We have made no progress in the first week. The only good thing to say is we are no further apart.\" Mr Pronk had just been briefing John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, who with more than 100 politicians from around the world arrived in the Hague yesterday to take over from his officials for the final week of talks. Mr Prescott was more optimistic. \"There are difficult areas and all sorts of stumbling blocks but I do not think it is impossible. This is still Sunday, not Wednesday or Thursday... We all must find agreement, we will be unforgiven if we have not found agreement by the end of the week.\" The talks are expected to deliver greenhouse gas reduction targets for the developed world of 5% by 2010, but each country has a widely different target and different ideas of how to reach it. Mr Prescott said that in Kyoto when the original agreement for reductions was reached the EU had wanted 15% and the US 0%. \"No one thought we would make a deal there but we did,\" he said. The US has been widely criticised for not taking domestic action to cut fossil fuel emissions. Instead it is claiming credit for removing carbon from the atmosphere by encouraging tree growth, changing farming practices and growing energy crops to burn in power stations. It claims that by managing existing forests properly it saves 300m tonnes of carbon a year - about half the US emissions. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a new global code of behaviour on emissions will require ratification by most of the industrial countries. Without a US endorsement, it would be difficult for such a treaty to come into force. The US Senate has passed a resolution making its ratification conditional on assurances that US competitiveness on world markets will not be harmed. Although the focus has been on the row between the so-called umbrella group - the US, Japan, Russia, Canada, Australia , New Zealand - and the EU, little has been heard of the role of developing countries. They do not have emission reduction targets, but under the agreement they should benefit from technology transfer and green funds to reduce their pollution as they develop. Most are critical of progress because funds and technology have not yet flowed. However, a senior US source described as \"chilling\" a letter from the Nigerian government to Mr Pronk on behalf of Opec countries demanding compensation for lost oil revenues if cuts in carbon emissions took place. \"They have promised to wreck the talks if we do not accede to their demands,\" the source said. Kelee Kreider, speaking on behalf of the four largest US environmental groups, said the US was exploiting loopholes. The group estimated that 84% of US emissions could be discounted through not ploughing land and allowing existing trees to grow. \"It is unclear to us that there will be any benefit to the climate,\" she said. Roger Ballentine, President Bill Clinton's climate adviser, said: \"The rift between the US and EU has been somewhat overblown...We want a deal out of these talks.\" Another unresolved issue is how to enforce the treaty. The EU and some developing countries favour a fine for carbon emissions above the treaty target. The money would be ploughed back into carbon saving measures. A figure of \u00a330 a tonne has been mentioned, which could potentially cost the US billions of dollars. Who wants what US, Russia, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Canada \u2022 Forests, crops etc at home counted as carbon credits. \u2022 Aiding forestation abroad to be counted as a credit. \u2022 States that have met carbon reduction targets can sell their surplus to those that have not.

      "bodyText": "The Daily Mail has been ruled out of the bidding race for the Express newspapers, it emerged today. Industry sources say the battle for ownership has turned into a two-horse race between the Hinduja brothers and OK! magazine publishing tycoon Richard Desmond. United News &amp; Media, owner of the titles, wants the sale settled within one week and will plump for the party which carries the least regulatory baggage. Sources say the issue of the Express has become \"a complete distraction\" for United boss Lord Hollick, who is now determined to get on with transforming the company into a business information player, now retitled United Business Media. Bids from the Hindujas and surprise entrant Mr Desmond, who owns publisher Northern &amp; Shell, are Lord Hollick's favourites because they can be rushed through. This is because they will escape the clutches of regulators because neither party owns another newspaper. The Daily Mail's \u00a3120m bid would be immediately referred to regulators under newspaper watchdog rules. However, they may be in a position to pick up the Daily Star, which could be sold on if the Hindujas win the race. The brothers have already let it be known that they would be interested in selling the Star to the Mail. The Daily Mail has been pushed out of the picture by United's shock demand for a non-refundable \u00a360m deposit to see private financial documents related to the Express. Such demands also appear to have put off a possible bid from Hollinger, owner of the Daily Telegraph. Mr Desmond has refused to comment on his interest in the Express.",

In a separate move, Bill McCarthy, his deputy director of finance and one of the architects of the NHS plan, is also to leave, for an unspecified operational job in the health service. The moves are the latest in a shake-up of the top tier of the NHS executive following the publication of the NHS plan, and the arrival in October of a new NHS chief executive Nigel Crisp. Reeves, who has held the top NHS finance job for the past six and a half years, is to head up the review board of the Accountancy Foundation, a body set up to regulate and advise the accountancy profession.

One manager paid tribute to Reeves as \"a manager with great good humour, which often disguised how much impact his thinking had\" on the development of NHS finance. McCarthy was instrumental in drawing up the NHS plan.

      "bodyText": "Companies that paid out millions of pounds to become official sponsors of the Sydney Olympics may have wasted their money, according to research from advertising strategists CIA Medialab. A survey carried out by the company showed almost 50% of adults didn't know who any of the Olympic sponsors were, despite prompting by interviewers. The findings are even more shocking given that over 80% of those questioned said they had watched at least some of the games. Worse still for the sponsors, levels of brand recognition were the same for many of the sponsors' biggest competitors as they were for the sponsors themselves. This is because of so-called hijack sponsorship, where companies that aren't official sponsors ally themselves to the games. Nike, which paid an estimated \u00a315m for its official sponsor status, actually scored slightly lower than arch-rival Adidas, which paid far less to be the official outfitter for the US Olympic team. CIA says this is because Nike and Adidas spent roughly the same amount on advertising on television during the Olympics. Oliver Rowe, operations manager at CIA Medialab, said: \"I wouldn't agree that sponsorship fails to deliver, but the way people explain their involvement is crucial.

      "bodyText": "Magazines are a growing cause of offence with watchdogs upholding more complaints against them than newspapers. With a glut of celebrity magazines providing a lucrative new home for paparazzi photographs, the Press Complaints Commission now faces a new regulatory battle. Sources at the PCC, which ruled against OK! magazine for publishing unauthorised photographs of Prince William while on his gap year, said today it had upheld more decisions against magazines than against any other section of the press in the past year. The PCC ruled that the magazine was guilty of \"harassment\" and \"breach of privacy\", after photographs appeared of the prince in the South American jungle. According to sources, the photographs had been offered to all the tabloid newspapers but had been turned down. The PCC refused to comment on the ruling until its official publication, which will not be made until three months after the date of the complaint. But an insider said that the growth of the magazines sector and the importance of showbusiness in news meant that magazines now had as high profile a role in press ethics as newspapers. The PCC has made a number of rulings against magazines concerning privacy and ethics, notably against Hello! for publishing pictures of Sir Paul McCartney praying in a cathedral, FHM for an article about student suicide, and Front for paying former gangster Reggie Kray. The commission decided to investigate the Prince William incident following a complaint by Stephen Lamporte, principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales. The ruling, which is the first concerning the prince, is likely to be seen as a warning to the press before he starts university next year. The ruling is understood to state that the prince was in a place where he would normally have been able to expect a reasonable degree of privacy. An insider said: \"The view that the commission took was that he was so far into the jungle that it's a bit different from just walking down the King's Road.\" Meanwhile, the commission is waiting to hear from the Mail on Sunday as to whether it can resolve a complaint made by Buckingham Palace on behalf of Prince Andrew, after the paper published a story linking the prince with an alleged drug dealer.",

It says it will only happen on two occasions and the soap will be broadcast on ITV at 9.45pm after the football.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"Coronation Street is moved anyway because of the football and normally there is also football on ITV2. On these two nights we thought we would put it on at the normal time on ITV2 to give those viewers who have ONdigital and cable a chance to see it. Otherwise it will be on ITV as normal - after the football.\"</p> <p>The move is a sign of the ITV companies' determination to beef up ITV2. As part of their strategy for closer cooperation, Carlton Communications and Granada Media are expected to focus on improving the programming, marketing and distribution of ITV2.</p> <p>The channel is currently only available in around 2.7m ONdigital and cable homes in England and Wales, because of ITV's refusal to do a distribution deal with Sky Digital.</p> <p>ITV2 has a 7.30pm window for Coronation Street because there is only one English team playing live in peak-time on Wednesday. Usually, the channel would carry live coverage of the second game involving an English side.</p> <p>The next time this will happen is expected to be Wednesday December 6.</p>",

Wednesday night's instalment of the flagship ITV soap will go out first on ITV2 at 7.30pm, when the main channel is showing live Champions League football coverage of Leeds v Real Madrid. ITV bosses insist it is not the slippery slope for the soap, which has been the linchpin of the schedules for decades. It says it will only happen on two occasions and the soap will be broadcast on ITV at 9.45pm after the football. A spokeswoman said: \"Coronation Street is moved anyway because of the football and normally there is also football on ITV2. On these two nights we thought we would put it on at the normal time on ITV2 to give those viewers who have ONdigital and cable a chance to see it. Otherwise it will be on ITV as normal - after the football.\" The move is a sign of the ITV companies' determination to beef up ITV2. As part of their strategy for closer cooperation, Carlton Communications and Granada Media are expected to focus on improving the programming, marketing and distribution of ITV2. The channel is currently only available in around 2.7m ONdigital and cable homes in England and Wales, because of ITV's refusal to do a distribution deal with Sky Digital. ITV2 has a 7.30pm window for Coronation Street because there is only one English team playing live in peak-time on Wednesday. Usually, the channel would carry live coverage of the second game involving an English side. The next time this will happen is expected to be Wednesday December 6.",

And that's the scaled down estimate. Schwarzenegger told Metro newspaper on Friday: \"The two drafts I read were so big it would have cost $250m to make. So now they're toning it down. I think we can do it on a football field somewhere so it doesn't cost that much.\" As we reported last summer, Schwarzenegger is overseeing rewrites of the script himself, and during promotion for his current box-office outing The Sixth Day, the star began hinting at plot details. The villain will be a female Terminator, he revealed. \"She can disappear, she can mould into someone else, and she is sometimes just an energy,\" he told The New York Post, in refreshingly plain English. Big Arn let slip more of his cunning plan to Ananova. \"They used a girl as one of the villains in X-Men and it worked for them. Our lady would also be very attractive and, of course, have a thing about me.\" Lucky lass Carrie-Anne Moss (best known for The Matrix) is reputed to be the producers' first choice for the role. The current script focuses on the rise to self-awareness by global artificial intelligence system Skynet, before it turns on its makers and attempts to eliminate mankind. Only Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong, who played the young John Connor in Terminator 2, have agreed to star in the movie. As we reported earlier this month, Linda Hamilton has declined to reprise her role as feisty mum.",

It is a result that has eluded the hit game show since it began more than two years ago. And the question everyone is asking this morning is whether the questions in the show are any easier than normal? For ITV will be screening the nail-biting episode at 9pm, at exactly the same time as Victor Meldrew bids the nation farewell on the BBC. The grumpy pensioner, played by Richard Wilson, makes his final appearance in One Foot in the Grave and BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey has been looking forward to it for weeks. She has planned a documentary on the making of One Foot in the Grave to precede it and hopes are high that it will pull in at least as many viewers as the 13m that final Inspector Morse attracted last week. Now, however, the nation will be divided between the final episode of the BBC sitcom and the spectacle of TV's first ever true millionaire game show winner - Chris Evans gave away \u00a31m last year on TFI Friday, but there was little hype or viewer interest. Executives at the BBC are suspicious that the ITV show has been dumbed down to boost the ratings for the game show. One BBC insider said: \"It is bemusing.

Judith Keppel, 58, scooped the jackpot in the programme, which was recorded last night. She appeared on Saturday night's episode and had got to the \u00a316,000 level using only one lifeline.

      "byline": "Giles Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Remember those wonderful old Citroens from the 60s, shaped like boats, low-slung, with the bodywork that almost covered the rear wheels? Those ones that it was technically illegal to drive without smoking Gauloises and wearing a pair of effortlessly tasteful sunglasses at the same time? Well, the new Citroen Xsara has absolutely nothing in common with them, except the name Citroen. </p> <p>The Xsara may in fact be the most characterless car on the market right now, apart from the Ford Fiesta - which actually forces you to admire it, the way you have to admire anyone who pursues a project right to its very end. In its determination to offer as little as possible in the way of troublesome excitement, the Xsara goes to virtually heroic degrees of self-restraint. All you can do, in the end, is take off the shades, put out the cigarette and bow before it in unmitigated approval - along with 1m other Citroen Xsara drivers already out there on the roads. </p> <p>Here's how exciting things get in the crazy world of the new Citroen Xsara: if you have a crash, the hazard lights come on automatically. Great news. You might be upside down in a field, but at least your indicators will be winking. </p> <p>I should point out that, tempted though I was to see this innovative facility in action - and tempted though I was, for a variety of reasons, to put the car in a field - I contrived not to have a crash in my Citroen Xsara. I am therefore obliged to take Citroen's word on the blinker gimmick. But I believe it. </p> <p>Other advances made by this new take on the old Citroen Xsara include three new ridges along the bonnet, clear glass in the headlamps and a bigger Citroen badge on the boot - which may now be opened using the remote control, or, as we must learn to call it, the \"plip\". </p> <p>Plus the radio aerial has been repositioned. It's now at the back. And the buttons that operate the electric windows have been moved. But I'm not going to tell you where they are, because I don't want to spoil the suspense. </p> <p>My Xsara came painted in a shade that Citroen refer to as Misty Lilac, or, as I preferred to think of it, Psychedelic Undercoat. Its message of a curtailed good time was at one with most of what lay within the car. The interior feels solid, reliable, uncomplaining, concerned not to startle you in any way. Even the screen for the navigation system (a daringly party-style extra in the context of the Xsara) is a modest strip, sitting quietly in the dashboard, rather than the usual loud screen, screaming for attention. </p> <p>I drove one of the diesel models. There's a lot to be said for diesel engines, particularly in relation to fuel consumption, but also in relation to the creation of cars that are boring to drive. Traditionally with diesel, acceleration is sluggish. You put your foot down, and the car gets the idea a few minutes later, by which time you probably need to brake anyway. </p> <p>Theoretically, in the Xsara, these are minutes you could usefully fill by catching up with some work on the Citroen Auto PC system - an on-board computer set-up, offering a voice-activated telephone service and email. Citroen's literature happily envisages the hyper-busy executive dictating orders to head office and confirmations to clients, \"using time that could otherwise be wasted sitting in traffic\". </p> <p>Except you can't yet, because the Auto PC system is only fitted to the continental models of the Xsara and Citroen says it is \"currently assessing the likely demand for such a system before deciding on availability in the UK\". I wonder what's keeping it. Why would British drivers not go for computers in Citroens as avidly as, say, French drivers? My own research at the wheel - which caused me to log sensations of peculiar disengagement in a variety of on-the-road scenarios - suggested fairly firmly that the need for distraction in a Citroen Xsara was a pan-European phenomenon. </p> <p>But it does seem generally that the exciting add-ons for the Xsara are only coming later to Britain, subject to further local testing. For instance, my time with the Xsara would have been perked up enormously, I feel sure, by the proposed incorporation of a reversing sensor - one of those devices which makes the car bleep at you in a panic when you start backing into the personal space of large objects. But again, for some reason, that's not coming along until next year. </p> <p>To be fair to the Xsara's diesel engine, it's a high-pressure direct-injection model - which means that that traditional diesel sluggishness is, in actual fact, chivvied out of existence. No time to go shopping on the net between gear changes after all. </p> <p>But only BMW, it seems to me, has genuinely got to grips with the most off-putting aspect of diesel engines, which is that loose, chesty cough they suffer from when ticking over. It's fine for idling post vans, but not necessarily the kind of soundtrack you want from a saloon, or even an enlarged hatchback like the Xsara. </p> <p>That said, there's something about that unperturbable rumble which suits the car right up to its aerial. It's a steady and sturdy vehicle, but it's never going to flip your plip. </p> <p><strong>The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Citroen Xsara 2.0 HDi </strong> </p> <p><strong>Price:</strong> \u00a312,995 </p> <p><strong>Maximum speed: </strong> 112 mph </p> <p><strong>Acceleration: </strong> 0-62 in 11.6 seconds </p> <p><strong>Consumption:</strong> 52.3 mpg </p> <p><strong>At the wheel:</strong> Delia Smith </p> <p><strong>On the stereo:</strong> Sade </p> <p><strong>En route for: </strong> The Norfolk Broads</p>",

      "bodyText": "Remember those wonderful old Citroens from the 60s, shaped like boats, low-slung, with the bodywork that almost covered the rear wheels? Those ones that it was technically illegal to drive without smoking Gauloises and wearing a pair of effortlessly tasteful sunglasses at the same time? Well, the new Citroen Xsara has absolutely nothing in common with them, except the name Citroen. The Xsara may in fact be the most characterless car on the market right now, apart from the Ford Fiesta - which actually forces you to admire it, the way you have to admire anyone who pursues a project right to its very end. In its determination to offer as little as possible in the way of troublesome excitement, the Xsara goes to virtually heroic degrees of self-restraint. All you can do, in the end, is take off the shades, put out the cigarette and bow before it in unmitigated approval - along with 1m other Citroen Xsara drivers already out there on the roads. Here's how exciting things get in the crazy world of the new Citroen Xsara: if you have a crash, the hazard lights come on automatically. Great news. You might be upside down in a field, but at least your indicators will be winking. I should point out that, tempted though I was to see this innovative facility in action - and tempted though I was, for a variety of reasons, to put the car in a field - I contrived not to have a crash in my Citroen Xsara. I am therefore obliged to take Citroen's word on the blinker gimmick. But I believe it. Other advances made by this new take on the old Citroen Xsara include three new ridges along the bonnet, clear glass in the headlamps and a bigger Citroen badge on the boot - which may now be opened using the remote control, or, as we must learn to call it, the \"plip\". Plus the radio aerial has been repositioned. It's now at the back. And the buttons that operate the electric windows have been moved. But I'm not going to tell you where they are, because I don't want to spoil the suspense. My Xsara came painted in a shade that Citroen refer to as Misty Lilac, or, as I preferred to think of it, Psychedelic Undercoat. Its message of a curtailed good time was at one with most of what lay within the car. The interior feels solid, reliable, uncomplaining, concerned not to startle you in any way. Even the screen for the navigation system (a daringly party-style extra in the context of the Xsara) is a modest strip, sitting quietly in the dashboard, rather than the usual loud screen, screaming for attention. I drove one of the diesel models. There's a lot to be said for diesel engines, particularly in relation to fuel consumption, but also in relation to the creation of cars that are boring to drive. Traditionally with diesel, acceleration is sluggish. You put your foot down, and the car gets the idea a few minutes later, by which time you probably need to brake anyway. Theoretically, in the Xsara, these are minutes you could usefully fill by catching up with some work on the Citroen Auto PC system - an on-board computer set-up, offering a voice-activated telephone service and email. Citroen's literature happily envisages the hyper-busy executive dictating orders to head office and confirmations to clients, \"using time that could otherwise be wasted sitting in traffic\". Except you can't yet, because the Auto PC system is only fitted to the continental models of the Xsara and Citroen says it is \"currently assessing the likely demand for such a system before deciding on availability in the UK\". I wonder what's keeping it. Why would British drivers not go for computers in Citroens as avidly as, say, French drivers? My own research at the wheel - which caused me to log sensations of peculiar disengagement in a variety of on-the-road scenarios - suggested fairly firmly that the need for distraction in a Citroen Xsara was a pan-European phenomenon. But it does seem generally that the exciting add-ons for the Xsara are only coming later to Britain, subject to further local testing. For instance, my time with the Xsara would have been perked up enormously, I feel sure, by the proposed incorporation of a reversing sensor - one of those devices which makes the car bleep at you in a panic when you start backing into the personal space of large objects. But again, for some reason, that's not coming along until next year. To be fair to the Xsara's diesel engine, it's a high-pressure direct-injection model - which means that that traditional diesel sluggishness is, in actual fact, chivvied out of existence. No time to go shopping on the net between gear changes after all. But only BMW, it seems to me, has genuinely got to grips with the most off-putting aspect of diesel engines, which is that loose, chesty cough they suffer from when ticking over. It's fine for idling post vans, but not necessarily the kind of soundtrack you want from a saloon, or even an enlarged hatchback like the Xsara. That said, there's something about that unperturbable rumble which suits the car right up to its aerial. It's a steady and sturdy vehicle, but it's never going to flip your plip.

You have been the victim of an act of depravity And you may never love again, Nevertheless you have only been raped And in the books that I have read Rape does not constitute torture, Not within the ordinary meaning of the word, So go home And take your exceptional circumstances with you. \u00a9 Benjamin Zephaniah",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We are desperate to impress. Barbara Taylor Bradford, possibly the world's most popular novelist, probably Britain's second wealthiest woman, definitely the country's richest author, is riding with us. I'm togged out in best shirt and tie, and the cabbie is pretending to be a chauffeur. He holds open the door while BTB pinches her fur to her bosom and slides into the back seat. We are driving a few hundred yards from the Dorchester hotel to Hyde Park so she can have her picture taken. </p> <p>She looks magnificent, positively regal. Her russet gloves match her russet Hermes bag and russet shoes. Those amethyst and gold earrings twinkle in unison with the amethyst necklace. She smells of face powder and seems to have a giant butterfly attached to her nose, which just adds to the atmosphere. I feel as if I'm in a movie. Perhaps a remake of A Woman of Substance. Our Barbara, the Yorkshire lass who once scoured her mother's front steps, has grown into this formidable woman who can make or break multinational publishing companies. </p> <p>Twenty years ago A Woman of Substance turned Barbara Taylor Bradford into a phenomenon. Until then she had merely been Barbara Taylor, successful journalist (woman's editor of the Yorkshire Post at 18, Fleet Street columnist at 20), and Mrs Bradford, wife to successful film producer Bob Bradford. The domestic saga of the servant girl who became a tycoon sold millions. Since 1980 she has written virtually a book a year, all of them blockbusters. Nowadays she is so famous, so feted, that she doesn't simply jet over from New York to launch new books. She launches films of the book and videos of the film and any number of BTB add-ons. Today she is in Britain to launch the BTB stamp. </p> <p>It's a bright, windy day. The trees are bending, the leaves dancing their frenzied dance across the park. The only immovable object is BTB's awesomely lacquered hair. She gives me her Hermes bag to hold, removes her sunglasses and moues into the photographer's lens. She tells me how fans come up to her and say: \"There was a terrible mistake in the newspaper the other day when they said you were 67, because you're only 50 aren't you?\" </p> <p>I think we're getting on well. BTB suggests we give lunch in the grill room a miss and head off straight to her suite. They say she's worth more than \u00a370m. \"You don't think the coat makes makes me look fat do you,\" she asks in languid Americanese with just a bristle of Yorkshire. \"Not that I care.\" </p> <p>She opens the door, ushers me in and introduces me to film producer Bob. I try not to look too disappointed. Bob, who doubles as BTB's manager, also has an amazing head of tanned hair. If BTB is a transatlantic Mrs Slocombe, Bob is a lugubrious Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple. </p> <p>He orders sandwiches before presenting me with a plastic wallet containing two stamps. The people of Grenada and St Vincent have decided BTB is just the woman for their new $5 and $6 stamps. Bob and Barbara know it's a first, even if they're not quite sure how. \"I'm the first woman other than the Queen of England on a stamp,\" Barbara says. </p> <p>Barbara has reinvented the word stamp. She opens her mouth wide and stretches the solitary syllable into a grandiose whinny. \"Normally in the United States and Europe, you cannot be on a stemmmmmp if you're alive unless you're the Queen of England.\" So she has become royalty? \" Ooooh! I wouldn't dare compare myself to royalty.\" </p> <p>Bob decides it's best to leave us alone. \"Bye honey. Get some air!\" BTB says. I tell her Bob reminds me of Walter Matthau. \"Oh, why? Didn't he just die? Bob has a very dry wit. He makes me chuckle every day.\" </p> <p>With Bob out of the way she gets straight down to business. \"I've just staggered away from a verrrry complicated book . . . it's a murder mystery.\" This is BTB's first murder mystery. Normally she writes sagas about women who face up to all kinds of adversity and come out smiling and rich. She gets upset when her books are labelled romances. The novel she is proudest of, The Women in His Life, is based on Bob's childhood as a Jewish boy caught up in the Holocaust. </p> <p>BTB says her heroines are role models for her readers. \"I tend to write about women going out and achieving things, strong women who have integrity. While being strong they are not hardbitten. I might have a bitchy woman in a book, but she'd never be the lead. I have to write about the kind of women I admire. I've always admired achievers, doers, women who won't permit themselves to be victims.\" I ask whether she has been the template for her heroines or whether her earliest heroine, Emma Harte, became a template for her. \"You know, I think it's a bit of both.\" </p> <p>BTB has lived in New York since she married Bob almost 40 years ago. Does she miss England? \"Oh yes. But you see I can't bring the dogs.\" Ah, the two poodles? She corrects me. \"Bichon frises. Beaji and Chammi are four. We had a dog who died in '92 at the age of 12, Gemmy.\" Gemmy was short for Gemini, even though Gemmy was a Scorpio. \"My parents were both Gemini and so is Bob, and my agent is, and his assistant is. So I'm surrounded by Geminis. I think I've got a photo of a painting of Gemmy.\" She digs into her wallet and produces a beautiful portrait of her dead dog. </p> <p>The sandwiches arrive, and BTB looks put out. She lifts up the phone. \"Vanessa, it's Mrs Bradford. Could I have some horseradish sauce and mustard, and also some lemon for the smoked salmon, thank you.\" </p> <p>BTB admits she is demanding, impatient of tardiness, laziness and incompetence. \"I think a woman should be able to cook a meal and look after family affairs. I'm very old-fashioned like that. I wouldn't let any maid touch the wooden furniture. Only I polish it. Put too much polish on and you ruin an antique.\" </p> <p>She and Bob don't argue because they are equally pedantic and bossy. \"But we've nobody to boss, except each other and the dogs.\" Does she regret not having children? \"I tend not to regret things that I can't change. I had a miscarriage and never got pregnant again, and I'm not someone who wants to go to two dozen doctors to find out why because I'm always too busy, too much in a hurry.\" She says it would be churlish to harp on about it when there has been so much love and luck in her life. Soon after the miscarriage, she began writing her novels. </p> <p>The phone rings. \"Oh Adrian! How are you? Oh, did I sound like Margaret Thatcher? Ha-ha-ha!\" Adrian is not the first person to compare BTB with Lady T. \"It was Lord Bellwin, a friend of mine who did a lot of work for Margaret Thatcher. He saw me giving a talk without notes and said, 'You remind me of a young Margaret Thatcher . . .' Please eat this because I've eaten so much today. I'll order some more.\" </p> <p>Does she think she is like Thatcher? \"I think I'm businesslike, organised, brisk, so there you might have an analogy. I did admire her. I do admire her.\" Once she was invited to Downing Street and, staring at a painting of Churchill, turned around and found Thatcher was standing alongside her. \"I said to her, 'I was just thinking, when I was a little girl in Leeds I never dreamed I'd be invited by the prime minister to 10 Downing Street and be standing here looking at that painting,' and she said, 'Oh yes, I know what you mean Barbara.' \" </p> <p>The longer we talk, the flatter BTB's vowels become. As the hours pass, I lose sight of the huge-haired New York caricature and find myself talking to Barbara the bluff, likable Yorkshirewoman. I ask her whether she feels embarrassed by her money. She says she doesn't see it so she doesn't think about it, and anyway she has earned every penny. What does she do with it all? \"I think one of the pleasures is to be able to give things to family and friends . . . not that either of us have much family.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the price of her success is that the critics laugh at the dark handsome men and tall blonde women of BTB's world. Does that hurt her? \"Well they haven't really read it; that's why. Well maybe you laugh. I don't know whether you do, but millions don't. Millions go out and pay good money.\" </p> <p> She tells me about an actor who had been hammered by a critic. \"I said, 'Let me tell you something. No critic has ever given one person one moment of pleasure, and you have, and I have.' I know it's a borrowed quote, but the public love me. They do. Otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you, and I wouldn't be on a stamp.\" </p> <p>Bob has returned, refreshed. \"Bob, Simon says you remind him of Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple.\" </p> <p>\"Why? He's dead isn't he?\" </p> <p>\"Bob, Adrian's three-quarters of the way through the book and he said I don't have enough superlatives. I think its brilliant. Are you listening to me? Baaaaarrrrrb? Simon, have a banana . . . I'm feeding up the boy from Manchester.\" </p> <p>\" Give him two bananas! \" Bob bawls from behind his desk. </p> <p>I ask BTB whether she likes herself. \"I do like myself very much. I think I'm a very nice woman, and I think I've accomplished a lot. I'm a good friend, wouldn't you say that Bob? Baaaaarrrrrb? I'm loyal, very generous . . .' </p> <p>\"Yeah,\" Bob grunts lovingly. </p> <p>\"Understanding heart, compassionate.

      "bodyText": "We are desperate to impress. Barbara Taylor Bradford, possibly the world's most popular novelist, probably Britain's second wealthiest woman, definitely the country's richest author, is riding with us. I'm togged out in best shirt and tie, and the cabbie is pretending to be a chauffeur. He holds open the door while BTB pinches her fur to her bosom and slides into the back seat. We are driving a few hundred yards from the Dorchester hotel to Hyde Park so she can have her picture taken. She looks magnificent, positively regal. Her russet gloves match her russet Hermes bag and russet shoes. Those amethyst and gold earrings twinkle in unison with the amethyst necklace. She smells of face powder and seems to have a giant butterfly attached to her nose, which just adds to the atmosphere. I feel as if I'm in a movie. Perhaps a remake of A Woman of Substance. Our Barbara, the Yorkshire lass who once scoured her mother's front steps, has grown into this formidable woman who can make or break multinational publishing companies. Twenty years ago A Woman of Substance turned Barbara Taylor Bradford into a phenomenon. Until then she had merely been Barbara Taylor, successful journalist (woman's editor of the Yorkshire Post at 18, Fleet Street columnist at 20), and Mrs Bradford, wife to successful film producer Bob Bradford. The domestic saga of the servant girl who became a tycoon sold millions. Since 1980 she has written virtually a book a year, all of them blockbusters. Nowadays she is so famous, so feted, that she doesn't simply jet over from New York to launch new books. She launches films of the book and videos of the film and any number of BTB add-ons. Today she is in Britain to launch the BTB stamp. It's a bright, windy day. The trees are bending, the leaves dancing their frenzied dance across the park. The only immovable object is BTB's awesomely lacquered hair. She gives me her Hermes bag to hold, removes her sunglasses and moues into the photographer's lens. She tells me how fans come up to her and say: \"There was a terrible mistake in the newspaper the other day when they said you were 67, because you're only 50 aren't you?\" I think we're getting on well. BTB suggests we give lunch in the grill room a miss and head off straight to her suite. They say she's worth more than \u00a370m. \"You don't think the coat makes makes me look fat do you,\" she asks in languid Americanese with just a bristle of Yorkshire. \"Not that I care.\" She opens the door, ushers me in and introduces me to film producer Bob. I try not to look too disappointed. Bob, who doubles as BTB's manager, also has an amazing head of tanned hair. If BTB is a transatlantic Mrs Slocombe, Bob is a lugubrious Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple. He orders sandwiches before presenting me with a plastic wallet containing two stamps. The people of Grenada and St Vincent have decided BTB is just the woman for their new $5 and $6 stamps. Bob and Barbara know it's a first, even if they're not quite sure how. \"I'm the first woman other than the Queen of England on a stamp,\" Barbara says. Barbara has reinvented the word stamp. She opens her mouth wide and stretches the solitary syllable into a grandiose whinny. \"Normally in the United States and Europe, you cannot be on a stemmmmmp if you're alive unless you're the Queen of England.\" So she has become royalty? \" Ooooh! I wouldn't dare compare myself to royalty.\" Bob decides it's best to leave us alone. \"Bye honey. Get some air!\" BTB says. I tell her Bob reminds me of Walter Matthau. \"Oh, why? Didn't he just die? Bob has a very dry wit. He makes me chuckle every day.\" With Bob out of the way she gets straight down to business. \"I've just staggered away from a verrrry complicated book . . . it's a murder mystery.\" This is BTB's first murder mystery. Normally she writes sagas about women who face up to all kinds of adversity and come out smiling and rich. She gets upset when her books are labelled romances. The novel she is proudest of, The Women in His Life, is based on Bob's childhood as a Jewish boy caught up in the Holocaust. BTB says her heroines are role models for her readers. \"I tend to write about women going out and achieving things, strong women who have integrity. While being strong they are not hardbitten. I might have a bitchy woman in a book, but she'd never be the lead. I have to write about the kind of women I admire. I've always admired achievers, doers, women who won't permit themselves to be victims.\" I ask whether she has been the template for her heroines or whether her earliest heroine, Emma Harte, became a template for her. \"You know, I think it's a bit of both.\" BTB has lived in New York since she married Bob almost 40 years ago. Does she miss England? \"Oh yes. But you see I can't bring the dogs.\" Ah, the two poodles? She corrects me. \"Bichon frises. Beaji and Chammi are four. We had a dog who died in '92 at the age of 12, Gemmy.\" Gemmy was short for Gemini, even though Gemmy was a Scorpio. \"My parents were both Gemini and so is Bob, and my agent is, and his assistant is. So I'm surrounded by Geminis. I think I've got a photo of a painting of Gemmy.\" She digs into her wallet and produces a beautiful portrait of her dead dog. The sandwiches arrive, and BTB looks put out. She lifts up the phone. \"Vanessa, it's Mrs Bradford. Could I have some horseradish sauce and mustard, and also some lemon for the smoked salmon, thank you.\" BTB admits she is demanding, impatient of tardiness, laziness and incompetence. \"I think a woman should be able to cook a meal and look after family affairs. I'm very old-fashioned like that. I wouldn't let any maid touch the wooden furniture. Only I polish it. Put too much polish on and you ruin an antique.\" She and Bob don't argue because they are equally pedantic and bossy. \"But we've nobody to boss, except each other and the dogs.\" Does she regret not having children? \"I tend not to regret things that I can't change. I had a miscarriage and never got pregnant again, and I'm not someone who wants to go to two dozen doctors to find out why because I'm always too busy, too much in a hurry.\" She says it would be churlish to harp on about it when there has been so much love and luck in her life. Soon after the miscarriage, she began writing her novels. The phone rings. \"Oh Adrian! How are you? Oh, did I sound like Margaret Thatcher? Ha-ha-ha!\" Adrian is not the first person to compare BTB with Lady T. \"It was Lord Bellwin, a friend of mine who did a lot of work for Margaret Thatcher. He saw me giving a talk without notes and said, 'You remind me of a young Margaret Thatcher . . .' Please eat this because I've eaten so much today. I'll order some more.\" Does she think she is like Thatcher? \"I think I'm businesslike, organised, brisk, so there you might have an analogy. I did admire her. I do admire her.\" Once she was invited to Downing Street and, staring at a painting of Churchill, turned around and found Thatcher was standing alongside her. \"I said to her, 'I was just thinking, when I was a little girl in Leeds I never dreamed I'd be invited by the prime minister to 10 Downing Street and be standing here looking at that painting,' and she said, 'Oh yes, I know what you mean Barbara.' \" The longer we talk, the flatter BTB's vowels become. As the hours pass, I lose sight of the huge-haired New York caricature and find myself talking to Barbara the bluff, likable Yorkshirewoman. I ask her whether she feels embarrassed by her money. She says she doesn't see it so she doesn't think about it, and anyway she has earned every penny. What does she do with it all? \"I think one of the pleasures is to be able to give things to family and friends . . . not that either of us have much family.\" Perhaps the price of her success is that the critics laugh at the dark handsome men and tall blonde women of BTB's world. Does that hurt her? \"Well they haven't really read it; that's why. Well maybe you laugh. I don't know whether you do, but millions don't. Millions go out and pay good money.\" She tells me about an actor who had been hammered by a critic. \"I said, 'Let me tell you something. No critic has ever given one person one moment of pleasure, and you have, and I have.' I know it's a borrowed quote, but the public love me. They do. Otherwise I wouldn't be here talking to you, and I wouldn't be on a stamp.\" Bob has returned, refreshed. \"Bob, Simon says you remind him of Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple.\" \"Why? He's dead isn't he?\" \"Bob, Adrian's three-quarters of the way through the book and he said I don't have enough superlatives. I think its brilliant. Are you listening to me? Baaaaarrrrrb? Simon, have a banana . . . I'm feeding up the boy from Manchester.\" \" Give him two bananas! \" Bob bawls from behind his desk. I ask BTB whether she likes herself. \"I do like myself very much. I think I'm a very nice woman, and I think I've accomplished a lot. I'm a good friend, wouldn't you say that Bob? Baaaaarrrrrb? I'm loyal, very generous . . .' \"Yeah,\" Bob grunts lovingly. \"Understanding heart, compassionate. Compassionate, Bob?\" \"A good wife . . . you're a good wife.\" \"My friend Bobbie Caplin said just the other day, 'Of course she has changed because she's a sophisticated woman of the world, but inside she's still the same girl from Leeds.' And I am when it comes to values. So there. So there.\"",

The lucky Victorians who travelled through the tunnels from Farringdon to Paddington - in steam trains - were amazed and enthralled by the feats of engineering. When the escalator was introduced, the underground had to employ staff to ride it to prove its safety to an overawed public. The stations built in the 30s are among the finest examples of art deco architecture in London. Yet when I told a friend I was applying for the job of station assistant he warned me, quite accurately, that underground staff rank alongside traffic wardens in the London public's hall of disdain.</p> <p>But it still looked like a pretty good deal. When I was in the dole office and I saw the advert, all I noticed was the wages: about \u00a315,000 a year. They have since risen. Today the starting salary is \u00a317,000 a year. Not bad for a job for which you do not need qualifications. Station supervisors in central London can earn around \u00a330,000, and, with sympathetic bosses, you can go from station assistant to station supervisor in two years.</p> <p>In the old days, wages were poor, drinking among staff was rife and the fact that King's Cross did not burn down every day truly is a reason to believe in God. After the 1987 fire, however, nothing could be the same again, and the so-called Company Plan shook up the organisation with a lot of mission statements, sackings and wage rises. Those who held on to their jobs were soon mingling with graduates and ex-professionals who had not found anywhere else to earn such a living wage.</p> <p>So I took the job in good faith, with a half-formed plan to let all the fare evaders off, take night walks in the tunnels and even be friendly to the weary public. I was, after all, one of them, born and bred in the shadow of the underground roundel, and I had this dream of a station where the locals would know we were on their side - a place where only tourists would buy tickets and we would have a friendly word for the regulars at the end of their journey. Perhaps Jeffrey Archer's mayoral dreams crumbled faster, but there can't have been much in it.</p> <p>The first thing that happened to me when I was set to work on my own on a ticket barrier was that I was immediately extremely bored. There is no adjective to describe clearly the state of mind into which a person can pass on a quiet day on the barrier. Like they say about enlightenment, to know it you have to experience it. There, however, the similarity ends.</p> <p>Secondly, I found that the general public seemed to be, for some unfathomable reason, pissed off all the time. Once, early in my career, a man laden with luggage approached me at the barrier and asked to be allowed through the gate. Naively, I asked for his ticket. Luckily, the gentlemen was happy to put me straight, at no charge. \"You fucking cunt. You want to see my fucking ticket do you. You want me to put all my bags down to show you my fucking ticket? I'll show it to you when I'm fucking through, you fucking cunt . . .\" Meekly suggesting that showing me the ticket either side would require him to put down his luggage made no difference.</p> <p>After a few of those kind of encounters the thrill of delivering excellent customer service begins to pall, to be frank. On another occasion I was checking tickets at the barrier and one lady showed me her ticket back to front. Innocently I asked her if I could see the front side of the ticket. \"I was fucking showing you it, you stupid prick . . .\" I hastened to point out that I would never have risked such an ear bashing had I seen the ticket, but this had no effect. She was convinced I was doing it simply to annoy her.</p> <p>Rudeness comes in many forms, from the tramp who wants to beg in your ticket hall to the young whippersnapper who wants to get himself and 13 mates through the gates with one child's travelcard. There is also the faux-rebel who wants to prove himself by being rude to a uniform. This kind of person saunters straight past you at the barrier as though he is hard and bunking the fare and then, when you pull him up, gives a great big sneer and produces his monthly travelcard.</p> <p>You soon develop tactics to maintain your self-esteem. Some are noble, but the most effective is simply to be ruder, faster - which is no mean feat - and the experts at this game are the booking clerks, secure behind bulletproof glass. The clerk's life is an exercise in frustration - trapped at the window, doing a job that requires concentration but little actual intelligence, faced with hordes of incomprehensible and indecisive idiots who are all trying to maximise the amount of effort you have to put in just to sell them a ticket. After days or, to be honest, hours of \u00a32.10 tickets bought by credit card and unintelligible tourists on top of a rush-hour crowd of miserable Londoners, the more sensitive clerk starts to wilt, and only dishing out tongue lashings, not always appropriately, can restore his sense of pride.</p> <p>\"Why are you always so rude?\" one customer asked the ticket clerk on my duty. \"The others here are always nice.\" \"Well come back when they're here then,\" he replied. On another occasion a customer couldn't believe what he had been hearing. \"I've never heard such rudeness in all my life,\" he exclaimed. \"You want to get out more,\" came the response.</p> <p>Letters of complaint are inevitable. Every so often, usually long enough after an incident that only hypnotism will bring it back to mind, a hapless manager trots along from wherever it is they while away their hours, a piece of paper in his hand, and asks for your response to such a letter. This will be a litany of accusations that have been so dressed up that if it turned out you had been clad in a devil's costume and torturing small children it would come as a relief. Of course, the manager has his job to do, so he usually admonishes you in some manner, with increasing vehemence as the weeks go by until finally, driven by boredom as much as anything else, he threatens you with a warning and you try to keep your head down for a while.</p> <p>The only behaviour, apart from rudeness, that can be safely relied upon is acute stupidity. Almost everyone who travels on the underground seems to be braindead by the time they reach the station. People constantly come and ask where to go to get the train and are then surprised to be told to go down an escalator. Sometimes they walk out of another exit back to the street. Even if there are only two platforms and two escalators, no questions are too humiliating to ask. Some ask where the Southern line is, so they can get back to where they came from that morning! There is no reasoning with these people, who take their right to be cretinous as God-given, and when the odd sarky remark slips out all hell breaks loose.</p> <p>For the humble station assistant - fortunately not stuck behind glass - the only way to avoid all this is simply to skive. The younger staff are quite brutal about this, going to the toilet for 20 minutes at a time and taking two hours to go three stops up the line and back again. But the older staff, schooled in the heady 70s, when doing your duty meant getting your round in, are in another world.</p> <p>I bumped into Derek, one such old-timer, one morning about four hours into his shift and he was off home. He had apparently been asked to take some urgent dispatch around the local stations, but when he showed me the envelopes they were all empty, having been planted there by him early that morning. This was such a regular feature of his day that I once asked him why he did not just come in three days a week. He said that then he would have to take his wife shopping. I asked him if he was satisfied with his job, but he looked at me blankly.</p> <p>\"I mean, don't you want to get more out of your job?\" His eyes lit up. \"Oh yes, I do,\" he said brightly. \"I want more hours out of my job.\"</p> <p>Once one of the managers went to him during the round of pay talks. \"What do you think of this rubbish the RMT want, Derek,\" he asked. \"They're never going to get a 35-hour week, you know.\" \"Thirty-five-hour week!\" Derek spluttered. \"No one's getting me to work a 35-hour week!\"</p> <p>Of course, the familiarity Londoners have with the tube tends to be familiarity with overpricing, overcrowding and under-running. The consequences of 30 years of efficiency savings has left a skeletal system that has no slack to accommodate the inevitable mishaps. In addition, the inexorable rise in passenger numbers means that even a fully functioning train service is bursting at the seams.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the organisation is being broken up in preparation for the most bizarre sell-off of them all, so that contractors working for the Victoria line, for example, cannot now attend an emergency job under the Northern line's jurisdiction - even if they are on the same station.</p> <p>The current crisis on the national rail system is a sure indicator of the direction the underground is taking as management fragments and the staff are required to be multiskilled, in order that one person can do three people's jobs.

The managers who bounce in, full of energy and enthusiasm, are soon worn down by the sloth and malaise of the whole place.</p> <p>It is this culture that has survived and even thrived despite the best efforts of the Company Plan. The underground clearly took on a lot of consultancy in the 90s, and so, suddenly, head offices are all open-plan; we are all getting personal development tasks, even if, in practice, these consist of being told to pick up more litter; and, most importantly, everyone is stressing our all-new customer focus. This all crumbles when it meets the wall of the culture, the negative, antisocial, institutionalising mindset, which nevertheless maintains people's self-esteem as they struggle to get by in stressful, frontline jobs with no incentive but the pay packet.</p> <p>Most of the managers have not come up through the ranks at all; most have been shifted over from some office or other - I sometimes suspect there is a factory in Milton Keynes churning them out - and are not always sympathetic to the plight of those on the front line.

No more than one sickness in six months, no matter how short or how well verified by professionals, is acceptable to keep warnings from your file. Once you are into the warning system, the amount of time you have to be illness-free grows exponentially. Invariably you end up coming into work sick as a dog.</p> <p>Infectious illnesses, I might just add, spread fastest on the underground. But don't worry because the public-private partnership is coming and we will all be out of our jobs soon anyway.

      "bodyText": "The London underground is a great example of familiarity breeding contempt. The lucky Victorians who travelled through the tunnels from Farringdon to Paddington - in steam trains - were amazed and enthralled by the feats of engineering. When the escalator was introduced, the underground had to employ staff to ride it to prove its safety to an overawed public. The stations built in the 30s are among the finest examples of art deco architecture in London. Yet when I told a friend I was applying for the job of station assistant he warned me, quite accurately, that underground staff rank alongside traffic wardens in the London public's hall of disdain. But it still looked like a pretty good deal. When I was in the dole office and I saw the advert, all I noticed was the wages: about \u00a315,000 a year. They have since risen.

Moreover, many local authorities learned long ago that they could negotiate better pricing agreements by pooling their collective purchasing power.</p> <p>The Improvement and Development Agency (Idea) has taken this one step further with its plan to set up the Idea marketplace - essentially, an online shopping mall for councils. The plan, quite simply, is to establish an electronic procurement portal that will enable councils to trawl through vast catalogues of goods and services, until they hit upon exactly the right combination of price and specification.</p> <p>Gary Richardson, director of assets and resources at Slough borough council, was seconded to develop the project. He has calculated that local authorities make more than 35m separate purchasing transactions a year, and that the cost of just administering the present system is more than \u00a32.5bn a year.</p> <p>He estimates that setting up a web-based system for ordering and buying goods could save councils a minimum of 15% - releasing significant resources for other local council priorities.</p> <p>Some 50 interested companies have joined forces to form 16 consortia that have lodged bids to set up and run the online service. A panel of experts is examining the final bids and the successful winners are due to be announced before the end of November.</p> <p>\"This is a impressive response from high-quality and blue-chip companies. We are amazed and delighted at just how many of the companies who attended the conference have put in a bid,\" says Richardson. </p> <p>In a separate initiative by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which is linked to the drive to secure best value in council services, Hilary Armstrong, the local government and minister, has set up a task force to review local authority commissioning and procurement policies.</p> <p>The review, like the Idea project, is designed to highlight existing council purchasing practices and subject them to critical examination. It is being led by former water regulator Sir Ian Byatt, who has stressed the need for purchasing policies to be carried out \"more effectively, so that local people get the services they deserve at prices they can afford\".</p> <p>Councils, contractors, professional organisations and unions have been given till December 8 2000 to respond to the review. The task force will hear oral evidence in the new year, and is expected to report by the end of May 2001.</p>",

Consortia exist that encourage bulk buying. Moreover, many local authorities learned long ago that they could negotiate better pricing agreements by pooling their collective purchasing power. The Improvement and Development Agency (Idea) has taken this one step further with its plan to set up the Idea marketplace - essentially, an online shopping mall for councils. The plan, quite simply, is to establish an electronic procurement portal that will enable councils to trawl through vast catalogues of goods and services, until they hit upon exactly the right combination of price and specification. Gary Richardson, director of assets and resources at Slough borough council, was seconded to develop the project. He has calculated that local authorities make more than 35m separate purchasing transactions a year, and that the cost of just administering the present system is more than \u00a32.5bn a year. He estimates that setting up a web-based system for ordering and buying goods could save councils a minimum of 15% - releasing significant resources for other local council priorities. Some 50 interested companies have joined forces to form 16 consortia that have lodged bids to set up and run the online service. A panel of experts is examining the final bids and the successful winners are due to be announced before the end of November. \"This is a impressive response from high-quality and blue-chip companies. We are amazed and delighted at just how many of the companies who attended the conference have put in a bid,\" says Richardson. In a separate initiative by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which is linked to the drive to secure best value in council services, Hilary Armstrong, the local government and minister, has set up a task force to review local authority commissioning and procurement policies. The review, like the Idea project, is designed to highlight existing council purchasing practices and subject them to critical examination. It is being led by former water regulator Sir Ian Byatt, who has stressed the need for purchasing policies to be carried out \"more effectively, so that local people get the services they deserve at prices they can afford\". Councils, contractors, professional organisations and unions have been given till December 8 2000 to respond to the review. The task force will hear oral evidence in the new year, and is expected to report by the end of May 2001.",

A succession of recent reports, starting with the audit commission's first local authority performance tables in 1995, has shown a steady decline across most services. Five years ago the borough was at the bottom of the league table, taking 37.4 weeks to let a vacant flat (compared to Knowsley's two weeks) and with 20% of its tenants at least 13 weeks in arrears (compared to Merseyside's 5%).

Industry sources hinted that a deal could come as early as this week. Mr Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell Group, publisher of celebrity magazine OK! and soft porn titles such as Asian Babes, has been regarded as a serious contender only in the past few days. United News &amp; Media, owner of the Express titles, was initially sceptical but is now thought to favour Mr Desmond over the billionaire Hinduja brothers. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank advising United on the sale, is due to continue discussions with bidders and senior executives at United today. Observers say an announcement regarding the sale is expected to be made \"very soon\". Mr Desmond is understood to be planning a stock market flotation for Northern &amp; Shell, which also includes the adult TV Fantasy Channel. The group's OK! magazine now outsells rival Hello! and is reported to have paid Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas \u00a31m for the exclusive rights to their New York wedding over the weekend. Mr Desmond is said to believe that the addition of the Express stable, which includes the Daily Star as well as the Daily and Sunday Express titles, would provide a pre-flotation boost. Speculation over the Express group's future has been intense, with no less than seven groups said to have expressed an interest, but the emergence of Mr Desmond as the lead contender will come as a shock to the Hindujas who were reported to be close to an agreement with United. The brothers, who have manufacturing and oil interests across India and Europe, are believed to have tabled a bid of about \u00a3120m. Any acquisition would be made through Amas UK, their wholly owned subsidiary. Yesterday it was revealed that the pair were looking to bring Gulf Oil, described as their prize asset, to Britain after taking over and rebranding a chain of petrol stations. The Hindujas are also known to be interested in buying 40% of Air India from the Indian government, but reports that they are mounting a \u00a3400m bid for Go, the British Airways-owned cut-price airline, were last night dismissed by their spokesman as \"pure speculation\". Prior to Mr Desmond, the brothers' main rival for the Express has been the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail newspaper, which is understood to have put in a similar bid. But its approach began to falter after it was made clear that, as a rival, a non-refundable \u00a360m deposit would have to be made to gain access to commercially sensitive information. Among the other parties said to be interested were Hollinger International, publisher of the Daily Telegraph, but it, too, would need to post a similar deposit to proceed. The Barclay brothers, who own the Scotsman and Sunday Business, pulled out of the running last month, although industry observers are refusing to write them off as bidders completely. Weekend reports also suggested that two other groups were considering putting together rival bids. A consortium involving showbusiness PR man Matthew Freud, Labour peer Lord Alli and media entrepreneur Chris Evans is said to be at an \"early stage\", while David Sullivan, owner of the Daily and Sunday Sport, is said to want the Express group's Daily Star title. Mr Sullivan is understood to have hired investment bankers to put together his bid but was not interested in either of the Express titles.",

But a copy leaked to the Times newspaper said: \"It was clear to the commission that Prince William was on a trip to a place where he had reasonable expectation of privacy and publi cation of these photographs was a breach of the code.\" </p> <p>It also agreed with the palace that they had been obtained as a result of harassment.

      "bodyText": "The Press Complaints Commission has censured OK! magazine for publishing unauthorised photographs of Prince William during his gap year in South America. In the landmark ruling on the prince's privacy, the press watchdog ruled that the mag azine was guilty of harassment and a breach of privacy in printing shots of Prince William during a 10-week expedition with Raleigh International in Chile, St James's Palace confirmed last night. The photographs of him hiking and crossing a river were taken with a telephoto lens, contravening the rules gov erning the young princes which were hammered out by the PCC and the British media after Prince William left Eton. The PCC's ruling is the first concerning the prince and will be seen as a warning to the press before he takes up his place at St Andrew's University, in Scotland, next year. The two-page ruling was not due to be published until January, three months after the complaint was lodged by the palace at the end of October. But a copy leaked to the Times newspaper said: \"It was clear to the commission that Prince William was on a trip to a place where he had reasonable expectation of privacy and publi cation of these photographs was a breach of the code.\" It also agreed with the palace that they had been obtained as a result of harassment. OK! has apologised to the Prince of Wales and Prince William. The magazine said that as far as it could ascertain the photographs were taken in a public place. Last night a St James's Palace spokesman said: \"It is very important to be clear that, during Prince William's gap year and his time at university, if pictures are used and they have been gained in a disruptive fashion, that is unacceptable.\"",

While the industry moguls have been tearing out their greying hair over spotty, scooter-hopping teenagers taking over their business, the artists themselves have been busy building up their own mini web empires, or at least laying the foundations for a time when they could conceivably bypass the retailer, the distributor, even the record company, and go directly to their fans. </p> <p>Creative thinkers from David Bowie to Badly Drawn Boy have been using the internet to disseminate their material for almost as long as the internet has been around. In the meantime, fan sites - where you can go to chat about Kylie's new hair colour, or discuss the deep political message behind Eminem's latest lyrics - have become big business. Nsync.com boasts 800,000 unique users; BritneySpears.com, 500,000 and Eminem.com, 300,000 - figures any dot.com would die for. </p> <p>It is only lately, however, that \"brand-name\" celebrities, such as Cher and novelist Stephen King, have woken up to the fact that the internet could be their future. And the former Baywatch star Pamela \"Don't Call Me Babe\" Anderson is about to launch PamTV.com, with assistance from the incubator Digital Media Campus. The trailer says it will offer everything from video clips to personalised photos, greetings cards and other exciting merchandise (what else would you want?). The fact that the founders haven't yet figured out how to make money from it doesn't matter. Despite 350,000 fan sites already dedicated to Pammy, they are halfway to digital domination. Why go anywhere else when you can get the real thing on PamTV, and start a pension plan for her? </p> <p>The recent skirmishes between record companies and artists such as Courtney Love, The Offspring and Aimee Mann is an early indication of what the industry feels about stars \"going behind their backs\". When punk rockers The Offspring declared they would release their new album Conspiracy of One over the web as MP3 a month before the official release, their label, Columbia, ordered their manager to withdraw immediately or face the consequences. Meanwhile Courtney Love (a longtime member of the netterati) and her band Hole are still in dispute with their label, Geffen records, over Love's threats to distribute their music on the web. </p> <p>Solo artist Mann, however, had no choice but to release her third album online after she was dropped by her label, Interscope. On her website <a href=\"http://www.aimeemann.com\">www.aimeemann.com</a> she launches into a polemic against her former employers and warns her fans off Aimee Mann - the Ultimate Collection, a \"sub-standard and misleading\" product, released without her permission. </p> <p>For many artists, divided from their fans by several degrees of management, the net is a chance to wrest back creative control. Cult solo artist Momus, who was signed to Alan McGee's Creation Records in the 1980s, took matters into his own hands in 1995. He built a home studio, started designing his own record sleeves on a Mac and got a website <a href=\"http://www.demon.co.uk/momus\">www.demon.co.uk/momus</a> where he could centralise his words, images and sounds. His 1999 album Stars Forever offered fans \"portrait songs\" on commission. He sold two a day and made $30,000 (\u00a321,000). He points out that if he had been able to keep up the output, he would have made $730,000 that year. </p> <p>\"For me, it's about taking control of the means of production. Being signed to Creation was exciting, but also frustrating. They'd do all the things that artists are not supposed to be able to do, but they'd do them badly. There would be horrible artwork bungles (your face would be blurred or smeared), marketing campaigns directed solely at spotty guitar music fans in paisley shirts, press releases and ads marred by poor spelling and terrible syntax.\" Other artists, such as the Cuban Boys, Ani di Franco, kd lang and DJ Scissorkicks, who have turned to the net for alternative marketing techniques, would probably agree. </p> <p>Bowienet (<a href=\"http://www.davidbowie.com),\">www.davidbowie.com),</a> the fansite and \"rock's coolest ISP\", demonstrates just how masterful a marketing medium the net can be. On top of the conventional fan fare - chatrooms, music archive, biography, the avuncular \"Ask David\" service and so on - you can buy original Bowie artwork (at New York gallery prices), artwork of art students vetted by David, as well as CDs and downloads. </p> <p>What Bowie devotee could resist this heartfelt request on the homepage from the reinvented cyber-Starman: \"[use the message boards and email more please] and we'll continue to grow by leaps and bounds, I believe, and this gives me a lovely, gooey, sticky kind of fun-filled feeling\"? </p> <p>Other official fansites that have grown enormously and are now threatening to become media channels are <a href=\"http://www.normancook.net\">www.normancook.net</a> (Fat Boy Slim's award-winning fansite) <a href=\"http://www.bjork.com\">www.bjork.com</a> (a recent merger between the two biggest bjork sites), <a href=\"http://www.Cher.com\">www.Cher.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.marilynmanson.com.\">www.marilynmanson.com.</a> Sting also obviously had plans for <a href=\"http://www.sting.com,\">www.sting.com,</a> the web domain that he tried, but failed, to \"claim back\" in a recent arbitration case, and we should watch out for further developments at <a href=\"http://www.-Madonna.com,\">www.-Madonna.com,</a> the domain name the star recently won. </p> <p>Is the Fan.com phenomenon something that should be keeping the suits at Warners and EMI awake at night? Chris Cass, MD of Vitaminic.co.uk, a digital A&amp;R network that aggregates artists' sites, thinks they are worried and with good cause. \"They spend all their money branding artists, and suddenly these brands are getting legs of their own. They're weighing up their options at the moment. To all these web upstarts, they are offering two alternatives: either capitulate, or play the game. Basically, they are afraid of creating another MTV - they don't want to have to spend ridiculous amounts of money on advertising something which they can't control.\" </p> <p>Marc Geiger, CEO of the Artist Direct.com, a network that enables fans to get everything they want about their favourite band or artist in one place and provides artists such as Marilyn Manson, Beck, Rage, Mandy Moore, Korn, Neil Young and the Beastie Boys with their own media channels, has no doubt that \"star-to-peer\" direct marketing is the biggest shake-up the industry has had in years. But he does not see it as a threat. \"The opportunity [for the industry] is far greater. Of course artists still need their record company relationships, their distribution offline, they still need marketing promotion. Direct marketing is a piece of the action, not a substitute.\" </p> <p>Geiger believes the net has created \"multiple new revenue buckets\" for the artists and distributors, who are partners on the site. For the artists, it's a chance to expand their traditional income (from recording, publishing, merchandising and touring) to retail, e-commerce (online ticketing being a big hit) and advertising. More importantly, in the long term they can capture the data of their fans for the first time and build up a global network. </p> <p>Geiger admits that it is still early days for artists on the net. \"Only if the artist puts themself fully into it is it going to work. Yes, when Courtney Love gets on the bulletin board to have a rant, it lights up like a Christmas tree, but not all artists have the time.\" Perhaps in 10 years, he speculates, we will see the Oasis.net lifestyle community or the Spice World virtual theme park. </p> <p>The day may indeed come when artists will free themselves of their management shackles and stand alone as brands, communities and retail outlets unto themselves. A few obvious ones, such as Madonna and Prince, are there already. It is more likely, however, that artists will continue to sit back and allow people to make money for them. After all, as Geiger points out, \"Rock stars don't as a general rule drive their own limos, tune their own guitars, or produce their own records.\" So why would they start now?</p>",

Yes, when Courtney Love gets on the bulletin board to have a rant, it lights up like a Christmas tree, but not all artists have the time.\" Perhaps in 10 years, he speculates, we will see the Oasis.net lifestyle community or the Spice World virtual theme park. The day may indeed come when artists will free themselves of their management shackles and stand alone as brands, communities and retail outlets unto themselves. A few obvious ones, such as Madonna and Prince, are there already. It is more likely, however, that artists will continue to sit back and allow people to make money for them. After all, as Geiger points out, \"Rock stars don't as a general rule drive their own limos, tune their own guitars, or produce their own records.\" So why would they start now?",

So how has she done since replacing Phil Hall? </p> <p>Let's start with the main controversy: the name-and-shame campaign that undoubtedly put Wade on the map. Few newspaper initiatives have provoked as big and sustained a public row, and none has led to such disgraceful outbursts of intemperate, and ill-informed, vigilante action. </p> <p>Following the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, Wade's attempt \"to protect Britain's kids from perverts\" by identifying a rogue's gallery of alleged paedophiles aroused roughly equal amounts of wrath and applause. </p> <p>Her aim was to pressure the government into enacting \"Sarah's Law\", making a register of convicted paedophiles available to the public. But it was pressure on her from the authorities that quickly forced the abandonment of the naming-and- shaming aspect of her campaign. There were too many instances of mobs taking the law into their own hands, with virtually indiscriminate attacks on houses and people. </p> <p>I never doubted Wade's sincerity. I also accepted that it was not a cynical exercise to raise sales. But it was dangerous. As a friend wrote to me: \"What am I expected to do with the information Rebekah gives me if my neighbour is a paedophile, except to ensure he is no longer my neighbour?\" </p> <p>On the other hand, in my local Brighton pub, I heard nothing but praise for the News of the World. This was her core audience and her populist crusade is certainly the major reason circulation suddenly leaped back above 4m by August. </p> <p>It is a campaign Wade is unlikely to win, but the recent decline in sales probably has little to do with that. Part of it is due to the inexorable downward trend for Sunday red-tops. The problem for all of them is how to survive in the face of growing apathy. Is there something wrong with the old formula of sex and sport? Is closure inevitable, or dare they try another course? How do they accommodate changes in society? </p> <p>My reading of the News of the World under Wade suggests that it is trying to introduce an entirely different editorial agenda from that of her predecessors. There is still sin, of course. The revelations about the private life of Liberal Democrat peer Lord Holme, forcing him to resign as chairman of the broadcasting standards commission, were a sad reminder of the paper's past excesses. The public interest defence, that he was a moral arbiter, was paper thin. He didn't really warrant exposure. </p> <p>But the NoW's sexual content now is generally less intrusive, relying more on titillating pictures than sordid copy. A story two weeks ago about \"an orgy\" involving pop star Martine McCutcheon's boyfriend stopped well short of embarrassing him. </p> <p> In these days of safe sex, the News of the World now appears to be wearing a metaphorical condom. Even its exposure of Frank Bruno's alleged misbehaviour with a prostitute was noticeably restrained, as was a romp featuring EastEnders actor Michael Greco. </p> <p>Many more pages are devoted to politics, though I can't see what qualities columnist Sion Simon has that his sacked predecessor Richard Stott lacks. Last week Julie Burchill was given a full page to profile Hillary Clinton, and the leader page was also devoted to the American election. It's impossible not to be struck by the paper's gradual, if hesitant, move towards the middle market, becoming a kind of red-top Mail on Sunday, or even a red-top Sunday Times. If the intention is to give it a Mail-style feel then it could well explain the baffling decision by Rupert Murdoch and his Wapping supremo, Les Hinton, to fire Hall at the end of May after five reasonably successful years. </p> <p>Perhaps they thought he couldn't have carried through the kind of changes necessary to take the NoW into a new direction. News of the World editors have always faced difficulty in dealing with Murdoch who - despite the absurd Dirty Digger stereotype - has always preferred a less salacious paper. </p> <p>Yet the whole ethos of the news and features operation is imbued with scandalous exposure. It's what the executives and reporters know and do best, and previous editors, while acknowledging Murdoch's strictures, could not ignore the weekly ration of sales-winning filth presented to them. Scared of sales falling too rapidly, they found it impossible to satisfy both the diktats of their boss and the appetites of their audience. Hall, as others did, therefore tried to steer a path between the two. </p> <p>Wade appears to be on her way, if gradually, to a wholesale change. To help in her transformation she is being rewarded with substantial investment. In January, the paper is to be revamped into three distinct sections. There are rumours that its Sunday magazine is to become a 48-page Hello!-OK!-style celebrity-led glossy. Then there will an entirely separate TV and listings section, thought to be 56 pages. Both are evidently in dummy form and undergoing market research. </p> <p>That kind of package could well make the going even tougher for the NoW's rivals - the Sunday Mirror and the People. The Mirror, after a brief moment of hope following a direct-mail initiative, is just about holding on to a regular 1.9m sale. The People, losing sales at a dizzying 5% a year, despite a lively editorial blend, is now down below 1.5m. </p> <p>Wade's NoW therefore has a mammoth lead and she can, if she has her management's full support, dare to take risks. That \"if\" is important though. Underlying all that I've said is the implication that Murdoch, Hinton and Wade are united in their vision of a new millennial News of the World. </p> <p>My hunch is that they certainly agree in outline, if not yet in detail. Wade has been given her head and it's up to her to strike the right balance. This is no easy task because much of the decision-making is a matter of nuance: \"sexy\" is acceptable, while \"sleazy\" is not; serious is good, dullness is unforgiveable. </p> <p>But how does one draw the line? And what happens if a rival, spotting the NoW moving away from its old habits, tries to take advantage by invading its former territory? Murdoch, his eye always on both circulation and advertising revenue num bers, hates to see any sacrifice in sales and income, and will want Wade to accomplish her revolution without losing copies. </p> <p>Given the decline of the market, and the likelihood of desertions among readers who, in the words of a rival journalist, \"only buy the Screws for the shagging\", it is surely impossible to expect the traditional reader to stay while Wade increases serious content at the expense of the trivial. </p> <p>It will mean a good deal of trimming week after week as Wade tries to maintain that balance. So this is an appropriate moment to offer a warning to people in public life currently indulging in philandering, or thinking about it.

      "body": "<p>Debbie Klein's report on women in advertising is valuable and timely - if only to remind us what a fabulous business it is and to congratulate ourselves (women, that is) on doing so well. In terms of numbers, it's a tiny business (13,000); in terms of impact on UK plc, it's really significant. </p> <p>But her research has found some unappetising examples of laddish culture in creative departments. Bizarrely, there are tales of pool tables being installed by the blokes as a symbol of masculinity. I know there are some ad agencies where the testosterone level hits you at the front door, and you know there will be only one token female inside, but I'm sure this is changing. In my own field of media planning and buying, most of the media owners are men, but the worst incident I have come across was when, in front of a client, an ad agency colleague called me \"dear\". </p> <p>Women are hugely influential in the ad business. We make up half the staff in the industry and a third more of us are in professional roles than 10 years ago. We now occupy 22% of the most senior staff positions and 9% of agency management posts. But do these statistics really matter? </p> <p>During the past decade there was an obsession with the \"names above the door\" of ad agencies. If women displayed their names more, they might be more visible. Nowadays ad agencies are more collaborative, more into team-working, and call themselves St Luke's, Mother or Circus, rather than Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. </p> <p>The important thing is to get the right mix of people, qualities and attitudes. At Walker Media, I've got a male partner (and I've managed to keep his name off the door). He's much cleverer than I am, but I've got more energy. We both recognise that. Let's not haggle over numbers. </p> <p>This report reflects some interesting social trends. Women in the ad business want a better balance between life and work. But so do men. As the author says, \"What was once a women's issue is now a human issue.\" The fact that advertising is no longer the only sexy business in town poses a threat to the ad industry. It risks losing talented women and men - those who are already in the industry and those who might be contemplating it as a career. </p> <p>When I started, I played the double bass. And hockey and tennis. I soon realised that I didn't have time to pursue them. But I did find time to have two children. </p> <p>What we've got to recognise is that if we want to attract talent, we must, as far as possible, accommodate the aspirations and ambitions of the people who are drawn to this exciting business.

      "bodyText": "Debbie Klein's report on women in advertising is valuable and timely - if only to remind us what a fabulous business it is and to congratulate ourselves (women, that is) on doing so well. In terms of numbers, it's a tiny business (13,000); in terms of impact on UK plc, it's really significant. But her research has found some unappetising examples of laddish culture in creative departments. Bizarrely, there are tales of pool tables being installed by the blokes as a symbol of masculinity. I know there are some ad agencies where the testosterone level hits you at the front door, and you know there will be only one token female inside, but I'm sure this is changing. In my own field of media planning and buying, most of the media owners are men, but the worst incident I have come across was when, in front of a client, an ad agency colleague called me \"dear\". Women are hugely influential in the ad business. We make up half the staff in the industry and a third more of us are in professional roles than 10 years ago. We now occupy 22% of the most senior staff positions and 9% of agency management posts. But do these statistics really matter? During the past decade there was an obsession with the \"names above the door\" of ad agencies. If women displayed their names more, they might be more visible. Nowadays ad agencies are more collaborative, more into team-working, and call themselves St Luke's, Mother or Circus, rather than Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The important thing is to get the right mix of people, qualities and attitudes. At Walker Media, I've got a male partner (and I've managed to keep his name off the door). He's much cleverer than I am, but I've got more energy. We both recognise that. Let's not haggle over numbers. This report reflects some interesting social trends. Women in the ad business want a better balance between life and work. But so do men. As the author says, \"What was once a women's issue is now a human issue.\" The fact that advertising is no longer the only sexy business in town poses a threat to the ad industry. It risks losing talented women and men - those who are already in the industry and those who might be contemplating it as a career. When I started, I played the double bass. And hockey and tennis. I soon realised that I didn't have time to pursue them. But I did find time to have two children. What we've got to recognise is that if we want to attract talent, we must, as far as possible, accommodate the aspirations and ambitions of the people who are drawn to this exciting business. If that means saying yes to flexi-time arrangements and part-time jobs, let's find a way to make it work. People in the ad business work long hours at full creative stretch. We'd be crazy to lose good people just because they want to work part-time. I believe clients not only understand that but are experiencing the same challenges in their own businesses. In terms of recruitment and management, the ad industry has to grow up. It shouldn't pretend to clients that someone is working five days a week when they're not. We should say: \"This is a fantastic person: they will make a great contribution to your business.\" We should offer our people managed careers, not just jobs. Graduates coming on the job market these days are debt-ridden, and already anxious about their financial security. Working in the ad industry is not a difficult sell to new recruits. But those of us who have prospered have an obligation to keep the business healthy. We should improve our involvement with universities. And once we've attracted bright individuals, we should be generous and imaginative about recognising their needs and rewarding their work. \u0095 Christine Walker is a partner in Walker Media.

      "body": "<p>The Economist insists it is a weekly newspaper - not a business magazine. Though with its relentless championing of free markets, \"viewspaper\" is surely more accurate. And from the moment you step inside its London headquarters off St James's Street and hang your coat on a stand crafted from an artful collection of sticks, you know you're a far cry from Grub Street. </p> <p>The tall, thin and ugly building has amazing views from its goggle-eyed windows, and not of Canary Wharf. From the boardroom, you look due south into the heart of Westminster. From editor-in-chief Bill Emmott's corner eyrie the view is due west over Green Park and into the sunset. A fine contemporary art collection lines the corridor walls (a former chief executive now runs the Royal Academy). Even the mugs in which the amiable, precise Emmott - who earned a cool \u00a3586,000 last year - produces afternoon tea are decorated with an Economist cartoon. </p> <p>Does this breed a master-of-the- universe mentality? Economist salaries are high enough to tempt anyone Emmott wants. And on top of that staffers receive an annual bonus related to performance (last year it amounted to 38% of salaries), and 20% of them own shares in the company. This munificence sugars the pill of the title's celebrated ban on bylines, designed to reinforce its authority and hide its use of freelance stringers. </p> <p>\"I don't think we're arrogant,\" Emmott insists. \"We argue a lot. We're a Marxist-style collective really - we're the most pro-free market collective ever invented. We have a great, argumentative character, and the great thing [as editor] is that you know the argument will go on in front of you and you can pick the winner.\" </p> <p>Though best known for its political and economic coverage, the publication which relishes ticking off Gordon Brown and gets excited by the American election photo-finish, also has an eclectic, ideas-driven side. Three weeks ago it ran a feature about British design education. It runs erudite book reviews, and advises you to run along to Sunday morning concerts at the Wallace Collection. Executive editor Anthony Gottlieb popped up last month as a guest on Radio 4's Start the Week, having written a philosophy book, Dream of Reason, while also running the magazine's expanding website, economist.com. </p> <p>Emmott himself is the author of two respected books on Japan's polit ical economy. After a shy start he amused a packed Media Society dinner earlier this year by jousting with another ex-Economist chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, still the only woman running a FTSE 100 company. Pearson, which she now runs, owns 50% of the Economist. </p> <p>In the New Year, this great British brand - originally conceived in 1843 to further the cause of free trade during the ferment provoked by the Corn Laws - will undergo its first full redesign since 1987, and Emmott plans to stir up the current affairs weekly sector with a big circulation drive. Banishing its traditional greyness, the magazine will switch in March to full colour throughout, with more emphasis on pictures. The typefaces are being cleaned up. It will also have a brand-new cover look - although a debate about the size of its masthead title, and just how stripped-down and cool it can afford to be, is still raging. </p> <p>\"We have resisted colour for a long time for two reasons,\" says Emmott. \"One is because our readers thought it was downmarket, that we'd be dumbing down like Newsweek. And it was very expensive and disruptive to our schedules.\" </p> <p>Also likely is a change to the name of the Economist's \"surveys\" (\"The name tells you nothing,\" says Emmott, \"it undersells the item\"), the celebrated extended essays by staffers on subjects ranging from e-commerce and Islam to marine ecology. And starting next month there will be a new quarterly supplement on technology: \"The genome was cracked this summer,\" says Emmott. \"I'd be against just an IT section, but the IT wave is added to by biotechnology, changes to fuel, and so on. It will be a broader magazine within a magazine, connecting these trends, how they disrupt and hopefully improve our lives.\" </p> <p>Why the shake-up? \"Readers' expectations have changed,\" Emmott replies. \"Colour is no longer an automatic sign of dumbing down, though it could have sent the wrong signals five years ago. And the technology is now there. It's designed to make the paper less inaccessible. Sales [up 4% last year] are growing healthily, but readers' letters and our research says there are barriers to entry: it feels a bit dull, the name is a bit forbidding, and a design that suggests grey and technical loses potential readers.\" </p> <p>Especially in Britain, which though it accounts for only 18% of sales - worldwide circulation averages 723,000, with around 125,000 in the UK - generates a large percentage of premium advertising, and has a higher proportion of news-stand casual sales than the global average of 70% mailed to subscribers: as the Economist's sister title, the Financial Times, sells 190,000 copies in the UK, Emmott argues: \"I don't see why we shouldn't sell 150,000-200,000 in Britain. It's the same sort of people. We compete in editorial terms.\" </p> <p>There is no intention, he insists, of changing content. \"We think we have carried a wide range of subjects for ever. Our name hides them.\" Shorter articles, then? \"We've always thought length and depth are not the same thing. There won't be less words, but I don't plan to make articles longer.\" </p> <p>The Economist Group's annual report for 2000 makes clear that it is setting itself some pretty ambitious new sales targets, ultimately aiming for 1m worldwide. Emmott, 44, and seven years in the post, says he sees no reason why his paper cannot double its current North American circulation of 324,000 (\"we're nowhere near Time or Business Week in saturation\"), though he will not tie himself to a timescale. </p> <p>And worldwide there is scope aplenty. \"The number of people feeling comfortable in English is growing all the time. Globalisation is here to stay and we are the house magazine of globalisation. We advocate it and report on it in all its aspects. We aren't a business magazine, we're a magazine that looks at the connections between business and politics, economics and social change, technology and the military. We stand for the interest of the informed, educated, curious person in the inter-connectedness of all these things.\" </p> <p>Isn't this a long-winded way of saying the magazine is about power? Emmott disagrees. \"Our readers who work for Oxfam aren't interested in power, they're interested in world affairs. I think there's an increasing interest in business coverage, but that's not specifically the market we are in. There is an increased market for serious, sophisticated coverage, in print and television. It's a niche, but a growing niche.\" </p> <p>In the UK market, where Emmott inherited a flat 100,000 circulation, he has used different covers from the international edition to boost sales. \"Big foreign news sells - the Gulf war, the American election fiasco. But normally local sells a bit better than global on the cover. </p> <p>\"Because of its rapid expansion overseas and its need to serve an international readership, the Economist of the 1980s wasn't paying enough attention to British coverage, which means we didn't have enough depth and didn't have enough impact from its British content. </p> <p>\"The crucial thing I did was to expand the number of British pages from six to nine, but cut to four in overseas issues. That meant I could put British stories on the cover more often, and we did big, meaty pieces on the BBC, the health service, reforming the constitution, Charter 88, transport issues, road pricing.\" </p> <p>I asked if the Economist's love of free markets had alienated readers during the 1990s as Britain rediscovered values Thatcherism rejected. Squashed again. \"Britain became more free market in the 1990s,\" Emmott counters. \"Blair is a continuation of Thatcher in many ways.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, on the online front Economist.com is being expanded as a privileged site for readers to drive subscriptions, with two-thirds of the content available only to print subscribers. Will the internet take over? Emmott answers without missing a beat: \"It depends on what readers want. If they want to get international analysis through the internet rather than print, that's the way we will operate. That's the beginning and end of it. An editor's interest is in the message rather than the medium. </p> <p>\"But for the moment readers are buying print in growing numbers but want something different - print plus internet. The internet is not proving to be a substitute so far.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the Matlock Mercury's cramped newsroom - a converted record shop storeroom next to Allday's in Matlock high street - editor Don Hale's phone rings every few seconds. The Times is clamouring to speak to him, as is the Express and the Mail on Sunday, then Dutch TV wants a word. Yesterday he appeared on an American lunchtime news bulletin, where he was introduced as \"editor of the Matlock Mockery\". </p> <p>Hale is wearing his \"anti-establishment\" tie - a comedy number with cartoon illustrations of men behind bars. The prisoners are captioned \"my lawyer\", \"my accountant\" and \"my estate agent\". He tries to deal with everyone calmly and politely, agreeing to meet the journalists who want to interview him. He has just put to bed this week's edition of his own paper. Its front page splash - \"He's coming home!\" - explains the media bedlam. </p> <p>\"I could have done with the cavalry a few years ago, but nobody wanted to know,\" he says ruefully of the current press interest. For six years, Hale has waged a lonely and occasionally dangerous crusade to reverse the conviction of Stephen Downing, a 17-year-old gardener with learning difficulties, for the 1973 murder of typist Wendy Sewell, in Bakewell, Derbyshire. </p> <p>Downing, who has served 27 years in what is probably Britain's longest running miscarriage of justice, had his case referred back to the Appeal Court last Tuesday and when Hale and I meet on Thursday, Downing was just days away from freedom. </p> <p>The local newspaper editor has dug up evidence of inconsistencies in the original police investigation - evidence that casts serious doubt on the semi-literate teenager's conviction. He also uncovered an army of potential witnesses who had either not come forward or been dismissed by the authorities, who could clear Downing and pin the blame on another man, who is alive and well and not in prison. </p> <p>In doing so, Hale has received death threats which have persuaded him to move house and go ex-directory, and there has been at least one serious attempt on his life. Also, the police threatened to sue him soon after he first broke the story. When he ignored this, the police backed down. </p> <p>Hale expresses only the mildest frustration that at the very end of the campaign a Sunday newspaper has signed a deal with Downing for his exclusive story of life in prison. The tabloid paper has minders guarding Downing's parents and will not let even Hale speak to the family. </p> <p>Hale's story is even more remarkable in an era when local papers are increasingly run from distant head offices, where profit-driven executives look on editorial as so many school fete reports filling space between the adverts. \"Time is the biggest enemy,\" he says when asked why this kind of journalism is out of vogue. \"You've got to have a gut feeling that you're going to get somewhere at the end of the day. But I felt so strongly that this was an injustice, and I wanted to see it through to its conclusion.\" </p> <p>Even Hale had doubts about the case to start with. It is hardly the Mercury's usual fare (headlines from the latest edition of the paid-for weekly include \"Praise for fire fight ers\", \"Four months inside for auto-crime man\" and \"2,000 plus at latest farmers' market\"). </p> <p>Hale remembers, \"An attractive young lady had been murdered by a local lad and he'd admitted it at the time. My immediate reaction was - don't touch it with a bargepole. But the more I looked at it the more anomalies there were.\" </p> <p>Hale has doggedly pursued the truth. He spent five months investigating between the time Downing's parents first contacted him in 1994 and January 1995 when the Mercury first splashed on the story under the headline \"Innocent or guilty ?\". </p> <p>The 48-year-old editor, who heads a team of three young reporters, is a former professional footballer (a \"promising junior\" for Bury, Blackburn Rovers and York City) who got into journalism through commentating for BBC radio, and freelance sports and feature writing for the Manchester Evening News. </p> <p>When Hale arrived in Matlock in 1985, transferred from a paper owned by the same publishers, he knew nothing about the Downing case and educated himself from scratch for the campaign. He sifted through court records and newspaper cuttings, knocked on doors and lobbied ministers, including then Home Secretary Michael Howard. </p> <p>He obtained a court order forcing police to release documents which they had previously denied existed. In the close-knit Peak district town of Bakewell, a place with an old-fashioned sense of neighbourliness, he has ruffled many feathers. </p> <p>On a dark and rainy night soon after the first exclusive, he was out side the local cinema when a sports car with its lights off accelerated towards him as he stood on the pavement.

      "bodyText": "In the Matlock Mercury's cramped newsroom - a converted record shop storeroom next to Allday's in Matlock high street - editor Don Hale's phone rings every few seconds. The Times is clamouring to speak to him, as is the Express and the Mail on Sunday, then Dutch TV wants a word. Yesterday he appeared on an American lunchtime news bulletin, where he was introduced as \"editor of the Matlock Mockery\". Hale is wearing his \"anti-establishment\" tie - a comedy number with cartoon illustrations of men behind bars. The prisoners are captioned \"my lawyer\", \"my accountant\" and \"my estate agent\". He tries to deal with everyone calmly and politely, agreeing to meet the journalists who want to interview him. He has just put to bed this week's edition of his own paper. Its front page splash - \"He's coming home!\" - explains the media bedlam. \"I could have done with the cavalry a few years ago, but nobody wanted to know,\" he says ruefully of the current press interest. For six years, Hale has waged a lonely and occasionally dangerous crusade to reverse the conviction of Stephen Downing, a 17-year-old gardener with learning difficulties, for the 1973 murder of typist Wendy Sewell, in Bakewell, Derbyshire. Downing, who has served 27 years in what is probably Britain's longest running miscarriage of justice, had his case referred back to the Appeal Court last Tuesday and when Hale and I meet on Thursday, Downing was just days away from freedom. The local newspaper editor has dug up evidence of inconsistencies in the original police investigation - evidence that casts serious doubt on the semi-literate teenager's conviction. He also uncovered an army of potential witnesses who had either not come forward or been dismissed by the authorities, who could clear Downing and pin the blame on another man, who is alive and well and not in prison. In doing so, Hale has received death threats which have persuaded him to move house and go ex-directory, and there has been at least one serious attempt on his life. Also, the police threatened to sue him soon after he first broke the story. When he ignored this, the police backed down. Hale expresses only the mildest frustration that at the very end of the campaign a Sunday newspaper has signed a deal with Downing for his exclusive story of life in prison. The tabloid paper has minders guarding Downing's parents and will not let even Hale speak to the family. Hale's story is even more remarkable in an era when local papers are increasingly run from distant head offices, where profit-driven executives look on editorial as so many school fete reports filling space between the adverts. \"Time is the biggest enemy,\" he says when asked why this kind of journalism is out of vogue. \"You've got to have a gut feeling that you're going to get somewhere at the end of the day. But I felt so strongly that this was an injustice, and I wanted to see it through to its conclusion.\" Even Hale had doubts about the case to start with. It is hardly the Mercury's usual fare (headlines from the latest edition of the paid-for weekly include \"Praise for fire fight ers\", \"Four months inside for auto-crime man\" and \"2,000 plus at latest farmers' market\"). Hale remembers, \"An attractive young lady had been murdered by a local lad and he'd admitted it at the time. My immediate reaction was - don't touch it with a bargepole. But the more I looked at it the more anomalies there were.\" Hale has doggedly pursued the truth. He spent five months investigating between the time Downing's parents first contacted him in 1994 and January 1995 when the Mercury first splashed on the story under the headline \"Innocent or guilty ?\". The 48-year-old editor, who heads a team of three young reporters, is a former professional footballer (a \"promising junior\" for Bury, Blackburn Rovers and York City) who got into journalism through commentating for BBC radio, and freelance sports and feature writing for the Manchester Evening News. When Hale arrived in Matlock in 1985, transferred from a paper owned by the same publishers, he knew nothing about the Downing case and educated himself from scratch for the campaign. He sifted through court records and newspaper cuttings, knocked on doors and lobbied ministers, including then Home Secretary Michael Howard. He obtained a court order forcing police to release documents which they had previously denied existed. In the close-knit Peak district town of Bakewell, a place with an old-fashioned sense of neighbourliness, he has ruffled many feathers. On a dark and rainy night soon after the first exclusive, he was out side the local cinema when a sports car with its lights off accelerated towards him as he stood on the pavement. He dived out of the way and landed in a heap as the car sped off. \"The following day I got a call in the office saying: 'That's your last warning'. The first thing I thought was: 'I'm getting somewhere with this because I've upset these characters.'\" He believes another near-miss with a car, when he was out jogging a few weeks before that, was also an attempt on his life. The hit-and-run attack and the malicious calls were duly reported in the paper. \"It has boosted circulation,\" Hale admits. \"People have been wanting to know what's going on - it's like a soap opera.\" Other people think he is barmy. But the impression Hale gives is quite the contrary; he comes across as a modest, quietly industrious hack who has built up a head of steam over an issue he cares deeply about. And Stephen Downing is not the end of it, either. Hale has begun to acquire something of a reputation among prisoners, and has become involved in three other miscarriages of justice. He says he has helped to achieve a release in one, a quashing of a conviction in another, and hopes for a result in the third. He recalls a prison visit to see Downing, when 20 other inmates lined up as he was walking out. Downing had been attacked in prison, and Hale feared trouble. \"Then they introduced themselves. They said: 'We're the innocent brigade.'\" For the innocent brigade, journalists such as Hale are often the only hope - and there are all too few of them around.",

      "body": "<p>Amazingly, we look as if we are going to get, in the Communications white paper, a genuinely liberal reform. Half a century of bureaucratic censorship, of nanny telling us what we can and can't see on our televisions, may be over. </p> <p>The signs are that the white paper will propose that, instead of the regulator drawing up a detailed code for programmes and advertisements, the broadcasters will do the job themselves. </p> <p>Since this is Britain, we won't go the whole hog - the new regulatory authority which will replace the Independent Television Commission will probably have reserve powers. It will be able to impose sanctions on broadcasters and programme-makers who break their own codes. None the less, it will be a significant change - the state no longer needs the elaborate panoply of control erected since ITV was created in the mid-50s. </p> <p>Why not? There has not exactly been a widespread public campaign demanding freedom of expression for programme-makers. The main reason is that when people in Whitehall looked at the implications of devising legislation which covered everything from the internet to the BBC they saw that technology was rapidly undermining their elaborate \"consumer protection\" system. When pornography on the internet is only a couple of clicks away, asking the ITC to police a 9pm watershed begins to look pointless. </p> <p>Instead, the self-regulation of the telecoms industry and internet service providers has become the model for broadcasting. The regulators themselves have argued for change. The broadcasters could scarcely oppose this, though it had not been high on their list of priorities. And the availability of parental control mechanisms in the new digital receiving equipment demolished a large part of the case for existing constraints. </p> <p>Of course, such a liberal proposal will have to run the gauntlet of moral guardians at the Daily Mail, with their fondness for vilifying late-night programming on Channel 5. Parliament may yet take fright - the House of Commons is not full of principled liberals eager to take on Paul Dacre. </p> <p>But, in the end, the underlying logic of the situation, together with a much greater common-sense tolerance among the public at large, plus the fact that we would be unlikely to see much immediate change - the broadcasters would probably import the current codes wholesale - should see this kind of reform through. </p> <p>There is of course another aspect to the existing nanny culture of broadcasting which liberals like me have always supported - the provision of public service programmes. (Heaven forbid that we should let the market on its own determine what we see on our screens.) Here the prognosis is slightly more dodgy. </p> <p>The white paper will endorse the continuation of public service broadcasting. It will probably propose various sensible reforms, such as the end of detailed supervision of the schedules. It will try to sort out some of the current anomalies in the way the BBC is governed. It may well try to create a long-term framework in which both the BBC and commercial public service broadcasters have a chance of surviving the arrival of subversive new technologies. But however sympathetic the government, it cannot guarantee the commercial success of ITV and Channel 4 in a world of growing choice. </p> <p> I ndeed, I suspect the biggest threat to public service broadcasting comes not from politicians but from the changing tastes and habits of both producers and consumers. The cultural differences between the over-30s and the 20somethings are wider than ever. Tim Gardam, Channel 4's director of programmes, argues that one of his biggest tasks is to provide young viewers who have grown up in a multi-channel world with a sense of the value of public service television - a concept to which they are largely indifferent. </p> <p>The different attitudes are beginning to be apparent in programme-makers as well. But then it is not surprising that a generation that has grown up in the casualised and ratings-dominated world of today's television has not imbibed the values that came automatically to their equivalents in the secure broadcasting organisations of the 70s and 80s. Public service television may be hollowed out from within. </p> <p>It would be ironic if, in a few years' time, millions of pensioners and middle-aged viewers who want public service television can't get it because the people who make the programmes have no idea how to provide it. I'm not sure the white paper can do much about that. </p> <p> Chris Smith would make quite a good Anne Robinson. The culture secretary might have some trouble with those Armani heels, but we all know he yearns to host a BBC governors' special of her TV quiz just so he can say to the chairman: \"Sir Christopher, you are the weakest link. Goodbye!\" </p> <p>The communications reform white paper is hardly in the same league as a gameshow, but the result was designed to be the same. After the BBC's perceived arrogance towards the last licence fee settlement, and an apparent divine belief in an untrammelled right to delve into the nation's pockets, Smith saw the forthcoming legislation as a chance to clip the wings of an organisation that had got too big for its boots. </p> <p>Unfortunately for those of us who were relishing the playground scrap that would inevitably have followed, the Guardian has learned that spoilsports at No 10 and the Department of Trade and Industry have confiscated Smith's toys. Instead of radical plans to strip the governors of key powers, the white paper will merely state the options and put off further debate until after the election. </p> <p>But that is not to say that the white paper will be an anodyne fudge. For, while some of the controversial aspects of broadcasting and telephony legislation have been put on the back-burner, this blueprint for legislation is intended to map out the way towards what Smith himself has termed the \"third broadcasting revolution\". Getting this right is essential now, because there will be no chance to revisit the legislation for at least a decade after it reaches the statute book. </p> <p>Those who have seen drafts of the white paper, which is nearing completion, say it is indeed a radical document. For the first time it treats all media, including the internet, telecommunications and traditional broadcasting, as merely different channels of the same multimedia world. </p> <p>This requires, of course, a major reorganisation of the confused and archaic regulatory system that currently governs broadcasting, the press and telecommunications. It requires, too, a redefinition of how the public interest - and the interests of the public - should be served in this new media age. And it requires a legal framework to ensure that creativity and growth are encouraged, not held back. </p> <p>For the past year, officials at the Department of Culture and the DTI have been working on this momentous document. Some observers suggest that it has suffered because of the relative inexperience of officials at the DCMS, but publication is now scheduled for December 12. Parliament rises two days later, and if there is any further delay, the white paper will not see the light of day until next year. </p> <p>But as the finishing touches are put to it, a fairly clear picture is beginning to emerge of the likely feel of the final document. </p> <p><strong> Regulation</strong><br> </p> <p> The most eagerly anticipated aspect is the nature of the regulatory framework that the white paper envisages. As expected, an over-arching super-regulator provisionally titled Ofcom will replace the plethora of existing bodies. Into it would go the indepen dent television commission, the broadcasting standards commission, Oftel, the radio authority and - interestingly - the radio communications authority, which awards spectrum space. </p> <p>It will be a formidable body: many observers had predicted it would have distinct arms to deal with the differing demands of content and economic regulation, but the latest drafts simply talk of one jumbo organisation. </p> <p>The white paper will spell out most of the areas over which Ofcom will have control. It will also specify that the BBC governors will come under the single regulatory umbrella. But the passages in this part of the document will be distinctly \"green\" - in other words, they will have the vague language of a parliamentary green paper rather than the traditionally more prescriptive basis of a white paper. Clearly, while Smith wants to wreak revenge on Sir Christopher for his brusqueness (the BBC chairman recently dismissed the culture secretary as just another \"licence-fee payer\"), he has been leaned on to tone down the language in the run-up to the general election. </p> <p>The BBC has lobbied hard against the imposition of an independent regulator. In private, the corporation concedes the principle and will rub its hands at the extra time that will now be given to haggle over the detail of what influence Ofcom would have. A senior BBC policy-maker says that the corporation will agree that industry-wide standards on content regulation should apply to the BBC and be monitored externally. The BBC will probably also come under more standard economic regulation on issues such as cross-subsidy of services and cross-promotion on air. </p> <p>\"They have been talking for some time about taking more of a non-executive director type role dealing with issues like strategic direction, monitoring the performance of management and making sure the licence fee payers' money is well spent,\" one source said. But it will fight tooth and nail any attempt to curb the governors' powers as the \"first line of defence\", answerable to the licence payers on political impartiality, fairness and the corporation's remit. It seems that, despite losing key policy wonks Patricia Hodgson, Dominic Morris and Robin Foster, it has won the argument. </p> <p><strong> Consolidation</strong><br> </p> <p> There is no suggestion, however, of any foundation to last week's reports that the white paper will back away from paving the way towards a single ITV company. The suggestion that the maximum 15% of total audience share rule would be abolished, yet the bar on one company holding both London ITV franchises (LWT and Carlton) would remain, seems absurd and does not appear in any of the white paper drafts seen by Guardian sources. \"I'd be staggered if they left this anachronism in there because this bill can't be revisited for years,\" said one ITV executive. </p> <p>All the noises from Chris Smith and government so far have suggested strong sympathy with the network being owned by a single company - a sentiment which he has repeated privately to the ITV companies. </p> <p>At the time of the recent deals, which narrowed the field to two, Smith said publicly that he wanted ITV to be a world-beater. In return, however, Smith seems likely to demand some key concessions on commitment to regional programming - an issue about which he is said to care passionately. </p> <p>So, it is expected that the audience share-limit will be raised to 25%, after which the competition authorities would decide on whether further mergers could take place. At the moment, the whole of ITV currently has a share of total audience of around 28.5% and, with the increasing proliferation of new channels, that should come down comfortably to 25% shortly after legislation is enacted in 2002/3. </p> <p>The radio industry, always cowering in the shadow of its more glamorous cousin, feels it has most to lose by being swallowed up into a single regulator. The major radio companies are already aggrieved by existing regulation, which they regard as confused and full of anomalies. One senior radio executive says that Janet Anderson, the minister responsible for broadcasting, has \"reasonably clear\" views that the ownership limits need to change. If the rules are relaxed, it is expected that many companies will take up small stakes in each other to mark their territory before the legislation is eventually passed - in much the same way that the ITV companies did when ownership limits were lifted. GWR, Capital and Emap have all made it clear they are poised to acquire further businesses if allowed. </p> <p>But while the march to a digital TV world continues apace, it seems that digital radio will continue to be a Cinderella service. Ministers have decided not to make even the vaguest statement about analogue radio switch-off: \"There are no votes in it,\" said one radio industry executive. </p> <p><strong> Public service </strong><br> </p> <p> One key issue that the new regulator will have to police is the sensitive area of public service broadcasting. At the moment, all five terrestrial broadcasters have public service obligations of varying degrees, without a clear over-arching idea of what all the various rules are meant to achieve. One regulator who has seen the latest draft says the white paper \"has a stab\" at defining public service broadcasting in the digital age. It seems that while the BBC retains its strict rules, ITV's \"box-ticking\" days are over. Possibly in return for higher spectrum fees, the rules that force ITV to broadcast certain hours of religious, arts and other programmes every week will be relaxed in favour of more general guiding principles. </p> <p>The definition of public service broadcasting, while essentially still based on the \"market failure\" model, will be widened considerably and it is likely that other broadcasters such as Sky and Discovery will be able to apply to a small central fund that would allow them to make a certain amount of public service programmes too. </p> <p>Clearly, there will be clear obligations placed upon the terrestrial broadcasters for some time. But there will be changes. An influential paper on content commissioned by the DCMS from Damian Tambini of the Institute of Public Policy Research, and Liz Forgan, a former BBC executive, introduced the concept of a regulatory \"league table\", ranking the degree of control over channels on a six-point scale, ranging from BBC1 at the top end to the internet at the bottom. </p> <p>The principle has been taken up, and a higher level of expectation will be placed on free-to-air universal services, such as mainstream BBC, Channel 4 and ITV, than subscription services and specialist niche ones directly paid for by consumers. This is an important - and under-reported - concession, for it means that the government is essentially admitting that it is impossible (and perhaps unnecessary) to regulate vast swathes of modern media. </p> <p><strong> Cross-media ownership</strong><br> </p> <p> In the emotive area of cross-media ownership, the white paper will introduce an important new principle: \"share of voice.\" The current rules, for example, ban a newspaper owner with a market share of 20% or more from holding an ITV, Channel 5 or radio franchise. The rationale is to ensure the public has access to a diverse range of \"voices\". </p> <p>However, the internet, which provides a bewildering array of voices, has thrown doubt on the need for this kind of social policy. It is also impossible to judge the issue of market share on the net. In this new age of pluralism, it makes no sense to have strict, separate rules on the ownership of newspaper, radio and TV interests when the media has become a multi-platform business. </p> <p>It is likely, therefore, that the white paper will do away with the different ceilings for the TV, radio and newspaper markets and lump them into a \"share of voice\" system, which will allow a company to straddle all forms of media. </p> <p>It is a fine principle, but as with the BBC's arguments over regulation, the devil is in the detail. The bigger media players are sure to demand flexibility, while the minnows are likely to object to any system that threatens their precarious existence. </p> <p>A further problem is how to com bine the factors of broadcast audience and advertising share with newspaper circulation figures. These will have to be blended into a single points system, so a circulation of 500,000 could be worth 2 units in the share of voice tally, and a 10% slice of terrestrial TV viewers could rack up 4 units. </p> <p>The government can put off the tough decisions, such as putting a ceiling on the amount of points available to a company, by leaving them to Ofcom. Those who argue for tighter cross-media ownership rules cite the Rupert Murdoch principle: he owns over 20% of the national newspaper market through titles such as the Sun and the News of the World, and has nearly 5m people watching BSkyB. But the horse has already bolted in Murdoch's case, as he has a foothold in the future of broadcasting thanks to BSkyB's market leading position in digital TV. </p> <p>Clearly, ministers are worried about offending the newspaper groups in the run-up to the general election. \"Why have any hostages to fortune if you don't intend to pass this until 2002 anyway?\" said one senior newspaper executive. \"I think they are becoming a bit risk-averse.\" </p> <p>In many areas, there are tensions between the DTI and the DCMS. The DTI is keen to sweep away many of the restrictions but Smith's depart ment is determined to uphold traditional public service values. </p> <p><strong> Public interest</strong><br> </p> <p> But while Smith may have lost some ground to No 10 and the DTI, his determination to introduce a powerful consumers' voice appears to have won through. Such a \"consumer council\" would be a focal point for complaints, dealing with issues like pricing and league tables on quality. </p> <p>To some extent Smith has already shown his consumer credentials by insisting that the current move to digital - driven by BSkyB, OnDigital and cable - is monitored by an advisory group of consumer/lobbyist representatives, to ensure people are not excluded on price and that the government is not bamboozled into announcing an analogue broadcasting switch-off date too early. It has also extended the list of protected national sporting events, and introduced improved public consultation for BBC new service proposals. </p> <p>But this does not mean lobbyists such as the National Consumer Council have won the case for a stand-alone statutory consumer watchdog. What seems more likely is that the new body will have a major duty to consult, order research and take soundings through devices including citizens' juries. It certainly means that many of the traditional worries about programme content, fairness, impartiality, the provision of high quality news, privacy, protection of children and the citizen's right of access to high-quality programmes reflecting British society will not be abandoned overnight. </p> <p>Preparation of this white paper has been long and tortuous. Many of its provisions will be distinctly vague, with plenty more tedious \"consultation\" ahead - conveniently putting off some decisions until after the next election. Much of the battle will be fought out in Commons committees and in the House of Lords. But, fundamentally, this white paper embodies the hopes of those who believe in the advance of the digital age: the revolution, it seems, is nigh. </p>",

For, while some of the controversial aspects of broadcasting and telephony legislation have been put on the back-burner, this blueprint for legislation is intended to map out the way towards what Smith himself has termed the \"third broadcasting revolution\". Getting this right is essential now, because there will be no chance to revisit the legislation for at least a decade after it reaches the statute book. Those who have seen drafts of the white paper, which is nearing completion, say it is indeed a radical document. For the first time it treats all media, including the internet, telecommunications and traditional broadcasting, as merely different channels of the same multimedia world. This requires, of course, a major reorganisation of the confused and archaic regulatory system that currently governs broadcasting, the press and telecommunications. It requires, too, a redefinition of how the public interest - and the interests of the public - should be served in this new media age. And it requires a legal framework to ensure that creativity and growth are encouraged, not held back. For the past year, officials at the Department of Culture and the DTI have been working on this momentous document. Some observers suggest that it has suffered because of the relative inexperience of officials at the DCMS, but publication is now scheduled for December 12. Parliament rises two days later, and if there is any further delay, the white paper will not see the light of day until next year. But as the finishing touches are put to it, a fairly clear picture is beginning to emerge of the likely feel of the final document. Regulation The most eagerly anticipated aspect is the nature of the regulatory framework that the white paper envisages. As expected, an over-arching super-regulator provisionally titled Ofcom will replace the plethora of existing bodies. Into it would go the indepen dent television commission, the broadcasting standards commission, Oftel, the radio authority and - interestingly - the radio communications authority, which awards spectrum space. It will be a formidable body: many observers had predicted it would have distinct arms to deal with the differing demands of content and economic regulation, but the latest drafts simply talk of one jumbo organisation. The white paper will spell out most of the areas over which Ofcom will have control. It will also specify that the BBC governors will come under the single regulatory umbrella. But the passages in this part of the document will be distinctly \"green\" - in other words, they will have the vague language of a parliamentary green paper rather than the traditionally more prescriptive basis of a white paper. Clearly, while Smith wants to wreak revenge on Sir Christopher for his brusqueness (the BBC chairman recently dismissed the culture secretary as just another \"licence-fee payer\"), he has been leaned on to tone down the language in the run-up to the general election. The BBC has lobbied hard against the imposition of an independent regulator. In private, the corporation concedes the principle and will rub its hands at the extra time that will now be given to haggle over the detail of what influence Ofcom would have. A senior BBC policy-maker says that the corporation will agree that industry-wide standards on content regulation should apply to the BBC and be monitored externally. The BBC will probably also come under more standard economic regulation on issues such as cross-subsidy of services and cross-promotion on air. \"They have been talking for some time about taking more of a non-executive director type role dealing with issues like strategic direction, monitoring the performance of management and making sure the licence fee payers' money is well spent,\" one source said. But it will fight tooth and nail any attempt to curb the governors' powers as the \"first line of defence\", answerable to the licence payers on political impartiality, fairness and the corporation's remit. It seems that, despite losing key policy wonks Patricia Hodgson, Dominic Morris and Robin Foster, it has won the argument. Consolidation There is no suggestion, however, of any foundation to last week's reports that the white paper will back away from paving the way towards a single ITV company. The suggestion that the maximum 15% of total audience share rule would be abolished, yet the bar on one company holding both London ITV franchises (LWT and Carlton) would remain, seems absurd and does not appear in any of the white paper drafts seen by Guardian sources. \"I'd be staggered if they left this anachronism in there because this bill can't be revisited for years,\" said one ITV executive. All the noises from Chris Smith and government so far have suggested strong sympathy with the network being owned by a single company - a sentiment which he has repeated privately to the ITV companies. At the time of the recent deals, which narrowed the field to two, Smith said publicly that he wanted ITV to be a world-beater. In return, however, Smith seems likely to demand some key concessions on commitment to regional programming - an issue about which he is said to care passionately. So, it is expected that the audience share-limit will be raised to 25%, after which the competition authorities would decide on whether further mergers could take place. At the moment, the whole of ITV currently has a share of total audience of around 28.5% and, with the increasing proliferation of new channels, that should come down comfortably to 25% shortly after legislation is enacted in 2002/3. The radio industry, always cowering in the shadow of its more glamorous cousin, feels it has most to lose by being swallowed up into a single regulator. The major radio companies are already aggrieved by existing regulation, which they regard as confused and full of anomalies. One senior radio executive says that Janet Anderson, the minister responsible for broadcasting, has \"reasonably clear\" views that the ownership limits need to change. If the rules are relaxed, it is expected that many companies will take up small stakes in each other to mark their territory before the legislation is eventually passed - in much the same way that the ITV companies did when ownership limits were lifted. GWR, Capital and Emap have all made it clear they are poised to acquire further businesses if allowed. But while the march to a digital TV world continues apace, it seems that digital radio will continue to be a Cinderella service. Ministers have decided not to make even the vaguest statement about analogue radio switch-off: \"There are no votes in it,\" said one radio industry executive. Public service One key issue that the new regulator will have to police is the sensitive area of public service broadcasting. At the moment, all five terrestrial broadcasters have public service obligations of varying degrees, without a clear over-arching idea of what all the various rules are meant to achieve. One regulator who has seen the latest draft says the white paper \"has a stab\" at defining public service broadcasting in the digital age. It seems that while the BBC retains its strict rules, ITV's \"box-ticking\" days are over. Possibly in return for higher spectrum fees, the rules that force ITV to broadcast certain hours of religious, arts and other programmes every week will be relaxed in favour of more general guiding principles. The definition of public service broadcasting, while essentially still based on the \"market failure\" model, will be widened considerably and it is likely that other broadcasters such as Sky and Discovery will be able to apply to a small central fund that would allow them to make a certain amount of public service programmes too. Clearly, there will be clear obligations placed upon the terrestrial broadcasters for some time. But there will be changes. An influential paper on content commissioned by the DCMS from Damian Tambini of the Institute of Public Policy Research, and Liz Forgan, a former BBC executive, introduced the concept of a regulatory \"league table\", ranking the degree of control over channels on a six-point scale, ranging from BBC1 at the top end to the internet at the bottom. The principle has been taken up, and a higher level of expectation will be placed on free-to-air universal services, such as mainstream BBC, Channel 4 and ITV, than subscription services and specialist niche ones directly paid for by consumers. This is an important - and under-reported - concession, for it means that the government is essentially admitting that it is impossible (and perhaps unnecessary) to regulate vast swathes of modern media. Cross-media ownership In the emotive area of cross-media ownership, the white paper will introduce an important new principle: \"share of voice.\" The current rules, for example, ban a newspaper owner with a market share of 20% or more from holding an ITV, Channel 5 or radio franchise. The rationale is to ensure the public has access to a diverse range of \"voices\". However, the internet, which provides a bewildering array of voices, has thrown doubt on the need for this kind of social policy. It is also impossible to judge the issue of market share on the net. In this new age of pluralism, it makes no sense to have strict, separate rules on the ownership of newspaper, radio and TV interests when the media has become a multi-platform business. It is likely, therefore, that the white paper will do away with the different ceilings for the TV, radio and newspaper markets and lump them into a \"share of voice\" system, which will allow a company to straddle all forms of media. It is a fine principle, but as with the BBC's arguments over regulation, the devil is in the detail. The bigger media players are sure to demand flexibility, while the minnows are likely to object to any system that threatens their precarious existence. A further problem is how to com bine the factors of broadcast audience and advertising share with newspaper circulation figures. These will have to be blended into a single points system, so a circulation of 500,000 could be worth 2 units in the share of voice tally, and a 10% slice of terrestrial TV viewers could rack up 4 units. The government can put off the tough decisions, such as putting a ceiling on the amount of points available to a company, by leaving them to Ofcom. Those who argue for tighter cross-media ownership rules cite the Rupert Murdoch principle: he owns over 20% of the national newspaper market through titles such as the Sun and the News of the World, and has nearly 5m people watching BSkyB. But the horse has already bolted in Murdoch's case, as he has a foothold in the future of broadcasting thanks to BSkyB's market leading position in digital TV. Clearly, ministers are worried about offending the newspaper groups in the run-up to the general election. \"Why have any hostages to fortune if you don't intend to pass this until 2002 anyway?\" said one senior newspaper executive. \"I think they are becoming a bit risk-averse.\" In many areas, there are tensions between the DTI and the DCMS. The DTI is keen to sweep away many of the restrictions but Smith's depart ment is determined to uphold traditional public service values. Public interest But while Smith may have lost some ground to No 10 and the DTI, his determination to introduce a powerful consumers' voice appears to have won through. Such a \"consumer council\" would be a focal point for complaints, dealing with issues like pricing and league tables on quality. To some extent Smith has already shown his consumer credentials by insisting that the current move to digital - driven by BSkyB, OnDigital and cable - is monitored by an advisory group of consumer/lobbyist representatives, to ensure people are not excluded on price and that the government is not bamboozled into announcing an analogue broadcasting switch-off date too early. It has also extended the list of protected national sporting events, and introduced improved public consultation for BBC new service proposals. But this does not mean lobbyists such as the National Consumer Council have won the case for a stand-alone statutory consumer watchdog. What seems more likely is that the new body will have a major duty to consult, order research and take soundings through devices including citizens' juries. It certainly means that many of the traditional worries about programme content, fairness, impartiality, the provision of high quality news, privacy, protection of children and the citizen's right of access to high-quality programmes reflecting British society will not be abandoned overnight. Preparation of this white paper has been long and tortuous. Many of its provisions will be distinctly vague, with plenty more tedious \"consultation\" ahead - conveniently putting off some decisions until after the next election. Much of the battle will be fought out in Commons committees and in the House of Lords. But, fundamentally, this white paper embodies the hopes of those who believe in the advance of the digital age: the revolution, it seems, is nigh.",

While it's still early days, the results have been an eye-opener. Bill Green, chief executive officer of ZagMe, says the service has done wonders for British reserve, with shoppers taken over by greed, unabashed about racing around Lakeside shopping centre screaming loudly. Green cites as an example an offer ZagMe ran on Wednesday which, in his words, practically caused a riot. Messages were sent to consumers to say they could get free CDs if they hot-footed it to the ZagMe stand and shouted at the top of their lungs. </p> <p>Reebok has already discovered that random text messages to nearby people has the potential to create essential footfall into shops.

She could see it taking off, and thought the fit between New Look customers and the age range of ZagMe users was strong. \"I'm sure we're going to be running lots more promotions,\" she says. </p> <p>After less than a week of service, ZagMe has already learnt a lot about its consumers and how they want to use the service. Green says the way in which shoppers interact with ZagMe is already developing. For instance when they arrive at Lakeside, they are encouraged to send ZagMe a simple message (\"LAK4\", for example, to mean \"I'll be at Lakeside for the next four hours\"), or leave a voice message to activate the service. Instead, says Green, consumers have started treating ZagMe like a friend and sending personal text messages. One example is \"Zag Me baby for the next 6 hours\".</p> <p>ZagMe is delighted with this, believing it shows that people think the service is fun and feel comfortable with it and the brand as a whole. Another early perception is that consumers have started to view ZagMe as a shopping agent, something to help them hunt down bargains. </p> <p>Also likely to be tweaked are the messages sent to shoppers as some have started sending messages such as: \"I'm in McDonald's, have you got anything for me?\", which is effectively a \"pull\" rather than a \"push\" service. Green says there are plans to beef up that side of the service and encourage consumers to ask for offers to make ZagMe even more personalised. </p> <p>Those worried about being inundated with messages from retailers clogging up their phone inboxes can rest easy, adds Green, as ZagMe promises not to send more than two messages an hour, unless users opt to change their preferences and agree to receive more. Accounts can be managed via a soon-to-launch website, zagme.com, and Zagpoints - points collected when signing up, referring new users and receiving messages - can be redeemed for pre-pay phone or store vouchers. </p> <p>Given that the penetration of mobile phones in the UK is now reaching 58%, and that 18- to 24-year-olds send an average of 10 SMS messages a day, it is no surprise that marketers are waking up to the potential of SMS marketing. </p> <p>According to a recent survey from Ericsson and mobile marketing specialist Mediatude, mobile phone- users are receptive to the idea of ads on their phones if they're getting something in return. It doesn't have to be much. The Ericsson survey pushed ads to participants who, in return, were merely given free text messaging. The results were encouraging: almost 40% found the ads compelling, and 20% asked for more information after viewing the ads.</p> <p>So is ZagMe just another flash-in- the-pan gimmick? Not according to retailers who, understandably, are happy that for once they are not being cut out of the equation because of a new piece of technology.</p> <p>The fact that Carphone Warehouse is one of the main backers of Spotflash, the start-up behind ZagMe, with a 20% stake, and the company raised \u00a31.9m in the summer in seed funding, should mean that the service is not just a fly-by-night trial that never makes it to a national roll-out. </p> <p>Green, a 36-year-old Canadian and former partner at Andersen Consulting who set up the company last year, says he is blown away by the response. \"It's way ahead of expectations. People love it and retailers are enjoying it as they've already seen it's a powerful mechanism to channel people into stores with simple loss-leaders,\" he says. \"We haven't even had the viral effect kick in yet.\"</p> <p>With Christmas just around the corner and retailers at Lakeside bracing themselves for riots, ZagMe is going to have a busy few months.</p>",

The results were encouraging: almost 40% found the ads compelling, and 20% asked for more information after viewing the ads. So is ZagMe just another flash-in- the-pan gimmick? Not according to retailers who, understandably, are happy that for once they are not being cut out of the equation because of a new piece of technology. The fact that Carphone Warehouse is one of the main backers of Spotflash, the start-up behind ZagMe, with a 20% stake, and the company raised \u00a31.9m in the summer in seed funding, should mean that the service is not just a fly-by-night trial that never makes it to a national roll-out. Green, a 36-year-old Canadian and former partner at Andersen Consulting who set up the company last year, says he is blown away by the response. \"It's way ahead of expectations. People love it and retailers are enjoying it as they've already seen it's a powerful mechanism to channel people into stores with simple loss-leaders,\" he says. \"We haven't even had the viral effect kick in yet.\" With Christmas just around the corner and retailers at Lakeside bracing themselves for riots, ZagMe is going to have a busy few months.",

      "trailText": "Downing Street is bracing itself for a spate of embarrassing leaks after more confidential accounts of cabinet meetings were published yesterday.",
      "byline": "Nicholas Watt, political correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Downing Street is bracing itself for a spate of embarrassing leaks after more confidential accounts of cabinet meetings were published yesterday.</p> <p>Tony Blair faced particular embarrassment from the latest instalment which quoted him declaring in 1997 that rail travel was not an issue. \"Railways are not a top priority,\" the prime minister reportedly told the first cabinet meeting after the election.</p> <p>Downing Street dismissed the lengthy accounts of cabinet meetings in 1997 which were published in the Mail of Sunday, following on from a report last week of a stormy cabinet meeting when the prime minister overruled objections to the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>A spokesman turned the government's fire on Simon Walters, the newspaper's political editor and thriller writer, who is believed to have compiled the accounts with the help of a former Downing Street civil servant, Mark Adams.</p> <p>\"We think that Simon Walters is in danger of going from fiction to fantasy,\" the spokesman said. \"Like last week's instalment - what the Mail on Sunday publishes bears no resemblance to the official record of cabinet meetings it is supposed to relate to.\"</p> <p>The spokesman's remarks were technically correct because the colourful language in yesterday's account would not have made it into the dry official minutes. However, one government aide thought that Walters was providing an accurate account.</p> <p>\"Simon Walters has got piles of stuff,\" the source said. \"This is going to go on for weeks.\"</p> <p>The instalments yesterday will provide excruciating reading for the prime minister. In a discussion about press coverage of the government at the first cabinet meeting after the election in May 1997, he demanded that ministerial special advisers should not talk to the press, an edict which has been ignored.</p> <p>\"I don't want to see [special advisers] talking to the media now we are in government,\" Mr Blair is quoted as saying. \"The last government got into great difficulties over special advisers.\"</p> <p>In another press discussion a month later, the prime minister is quoted as saying: \"I am worried about two kinds of story. One, that we can't handle it, and two, that we are arrogant and drunk with power. I have to say that of the two I prefer the latter.\"</p> <p>Downing Street's attempts to rubbish the Mail on Sunday are undermined by the prime minister's complaint at a cabinet meeting in June 1997 of his frustration at leaks. \"I am still getting reports of cabinet committee meetings being leaked,\" he said. \"Alastair [Campbell] has been alarmed to get complete read outs from journalists... It's going to be very difficult when the going gets tough.\"</p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, is also embarrassed. At a cabinet meeting in May 1997, Mr Cook was quoted as saying that the merger of the Western European Union with the EU - a demand of the French and the Germans - would undermine Nato. The merger has since happened.</p> <p>In a discussion on the legislative programme, the then cabinet office minister Jack Cunningham argues for a food standards agency bill. \"This is a health and welfare issue, not like freedom of information which is for the chattering classes.\"</p> <p><b>'We must turn the arrogance charge around'</b></p> <p><b>The following are claimed extracts from minutes of cabinet meetings.</b></p> <p><b> May 8 1997 </b></p> <p>Discussion of changes to legislation.</p> <p>Clare Short: \"On railways, we need to be able to give instructions to the regulator.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair: \"Railways are not a top priority.\"</p> <p>John Prescott: \"On rail, colleagues mustn't assume things haven't been bid for. We have many things to do on the railways.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair: \"Something else may have to be ditched. We need some eye catching stuff for later.\"</p> <p><b>June 5 1997 </b></p> <p>Tony Blair addresses the cabinet.</p> <p>Tony Blair: \"I am worried about two kinds of story. One, that we can't handle it; and two, that we are arrogant and drunk with power. I have to say that of the two I prefer the latter.</p> <p>\"We have to tackle this issue and deal with it, for example the Mail on Sunday story about a snub to the Palace. [A row over Bill Clinton not taking tea with the Queen.] We must meet these head on, and not allow ourselves to be diverted.</p> <p>\"Bill Clinton said to me that the biggest mistake he made in his first two years was not communicating, that he was too busy governing. Everything should be linked to a clear message.</p> <p>\"There are a number of issues. An agenda for the people of this country. It's their government. We are doing what they want, we are building one nation, a partnership. The country is coming together. This is very important, especially if the Tories go for a moderate leader. [Spoken just before William Hague's election]. We are preparing Britain for a modern world.</p> <p>\"There must be a strong direction and strong leadership. We must turn the arrogance charge around. We have had a good first few weeks, but we need to deal with the arrogance issue and keep campaigning. Translating good intentions into results will be difficult. We must let people speak, but they expect results. We must let people take it step by step. We can do it as long as there is a big picture there.\"</p> <p><b>May 8 1997 </b></p> <p>Discussion of legislation.</p> <p>Jack Cunningham: \"I am convinced we should have a food standards agency bill. If we don't, we will get more more problems later with food hygiene.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair: \"What do you suggest should be dropped?\"</p> <p>Jack Cunningham: \"That is an invidious position to put me in. This is a health and welfare issue, not like freedom of information, which is for the chattering classes.\"</p> <p><b>July 10 1997 </b></p> <p>The cabinet is told of an SAS operation against two Bosnian alleged war criminals.</p> <p>Tony Blair: \"We are continuing to track down war criminals. The SAS went after two this morning. One came quietly, and the other fired and was killed. The shot man was responsible for the genocide of Muslims and Croats.\"</p> <p>George Robertson: \"I don't want British troops in Bosnia to become targets. Lives could be lost if confidentiality is broken. It was a very difficult operation by very brave soldiers. Never say it was the SAS, just British soldiers.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street is bracing itself for a spate of embarrassing leaks after more confidential accounts of cabinet meetings were published yesterday. Tony Blair faced particular embarrassment from the latest instalment which quoted him declaring in 1997 that rail travel was not an issue. \"Railways are not a top priority,\" the prime minister reportedly told the first cabinet meeting after the election. Downing Street dismissed the lengthy accounts of cabinet meetings in 1997 which were published in the Mail of Sunday, following on from a report last week of a stormy cabinet meeting when the prime minister overruled objections to the Millennium Dome. A spokesman turned the government's fire on Simon Walters, the newspaper's political editor and thriller writer, who is believed to have compiled the accounts with the help of a former Downing Street civil servant, Mark Adams. \"We think that Simon Walters is in danger of going from fiction to fantasy,\" the spokesman said. \"Like last week's instalment - what the Mail on Sunday publishes bears no resemblance to the official record of cabinet meetings it is supposed to relate to.\" The spokesman's remarks were technically correct because the colourful language in yesterday's account would not have made it into the dry official minutes. However, one government aide thought that Walters was providing an accurate account. \"Simon Walters has got piles of stuff,\" the source said. \"This is going to go on for weeks.\" The instalments yesterday will provide excruciating reading for the prime minister. In a discussion about press coverage of the government at the first cabinet meeting after the election in May 1997, he demanded that ministerial special advisers should not talk to the press, an edict which has been ignored. \"I don't want to see [special advisers] talking to the media now we are in government,\" Mr Blair is quoted as saying. \"The last government got into great difficulties over special advisers.\" In another press discussion a month later, the prime minister is quoted as saying: \"I am worried about two kinds of story. One, that we can't handle it, and two, that we are arrogant and drunk with power. I have to say that of the two I prefer the latter.\" Downing Street's attempts to rubbish the Mail on Sunday are undermined by the prime minister's complaint at a cabinet meeting in June 1997 of his frustration at leaks. \"I am still getting reports of cabinet committee meetings being leaked,\" he said. \"Alastair [Campbell] has been alarmed to get complete read outs from journalists... It's going to be very difficult when the going gets tough.\" Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, is also embarrassed. At a cabinet meeting in May 1997, Mr Cook was quoted as saying that the merger of the Western European Union with the EU - a demand of the French and the Germans - would undermine Nato. The merger has since happened. In a discussion on the legislative programme, the then cabinet office minister Jack Cunningham argues for a food standards agency bill. \"This is a health and welfare issue, not like freedom of information which is for the chattering classes.\" 'We must turn the arrogance charge around' The following are claimed extracts from minutes of cabinet meetings. May 8 1997 Discussion of changes to legislation. Clare Short: \"On railways, we need to be able to give instructions to the regulator.\" Tony Blair: \"Railways are not a top priority.\" John Prescott: \"On rail, colleagues mustn't assume things haven't been bid for. We have many things to do on the railways.\" Tony Blair: \"Something else may have to be ditched. We need some eye catching stuff for later.\" June 5 1997 Tony Blair addresses the cabinet. Tony Blair: \"I am worried about two kinds of story. One, that we can't handle it; and two, that we are arrogant and drunk with power. I have to say that of the two I prefer the latter. \"We have to tackle this issue and deal with it, for example the Mail on Sunday story about a snub to the Palace. [A row over Bill Clinton not taking tea with the Queen.] We must meet these head on, and not allow ourselves to be diverted. \"Bill Clinton said to me that the biggest mistake he made in his first two years was not communicating, that he was too busy governing. Everything should be linked to a clear message. \"There are a number of issues. An agenda for the people of this country. It's their government. We are doing what they want, we are building one nation, a partnership. The country is coming together. This is very important, especially if the Tories go for a moderate leader. [Spoken just before William Hague's election]. We are preparing Britain for a modern world. \"There must be a strong direction and strong leadership. We must turn the arrogance charge around. We have had a good first few weeks, but we need to deal with the arrogance issue and keep campaigning. Translating good intentions into results will be difficult. We must let people speak, but they expect results. We must let people take it step by step. We can do it as long as there is a big picture there.\" May 8 1997 Discussion of legislation. Jack Cunningham: \"I am convinced we should have a food standards agency bill. If we don't, we will get more more problems later with food hygiene.\" Tony Blair: \"What do you suggest should be dropped?\" Jack Cunningham: \"That is an invidious position to put me in. This is a health and welfare issue, not like freedom of information, which is for the chattering classes.\" July 10 1997 The cabinet is told of an SAS operation against two Bosnian alleged war criminals. Tony Blair: \"We are continuing to track down war criminals. The SAS went after two this morning. One came quietly, and the other fired and was killed. The shot man was responsible for the genocide of Muslims and Croats.\" George Robertson: \"I don't want British troops in Bosnia to become targets. Lives could be lost if confidentiality is broken. It was a very difficult operation by very brave soldiers. Never say it was the SAS, just British soldiers.\"",

Something rather more serious - no, literally apocalyptic - lurks behind these frenzied American revels; something that, this week links Palm Beach and the Hague. A simple question: can democracy save the world? </p> <p>Guardian readers know that teams from 180 countries have gathered in Holland to try, one more time, to secure an agreement which reduces the greenhouse gas emissions that threaten the future of our globally warmed globe. Three years ago, in Kyoto, the leaders of those 180 countries solemnly promised to cut these emissions. They have not, however, been cut: they have risen. </p> <p>Even Kyoto, with the modest reductions it set, hasn't held. And, in particular, the US - with 5% of world population and 25% of emissions - has not kept to its word or the puny, insufficient targets it accepted in Japan. Unless the new rulers in Pennsylvania Avenue, whoever they turn out to be, can be persuaded to wake up and shape up, then we might as well not bother. A world environment policy without the polluter-in-chief is a hole in the head and a hole in the ozone layer. There will be no more important conference - for America or any of us - this year. </p> <p>Guardian readers know this because the Guardian reports it. American readers are less well served. In the US you may wade through dead forests of newsprint this morning without finding mention of the Hague. It might as well be happening on another planet, not the other side of our planet. And, anyway, George W Bush says he does not believe in global warming. He doesn't think it exists. Al Gore believes all right, yet he hasn't managed, over eight years in power, to do much about it. </p> <p>Hang on though! Isn't there, at last, a strong, growing American Green party now? And didn't it, in many ways, shape the whole presidential debate, raising causes that others feared to touch? Ralph Nader made the death penalty and privatised prisons and failed drug wars real issues. He put his old enemy, corporate power, in the firing line. It would have been a far poorer election without him. </p> <p>The thing that haunts me, 12 days on, is that it would also have been a different election. Without the irate grey panthers of Palm Beach waving their butterfly ballots, George W would already be far into his triumphant transition - and the clear divide between his victory or defeat was, and is, Nader's Green vote. We're talking 80,000-plus, not a frail 930. Nader, taking Florida Democrat votes quite disproportionately, filled out Bush's White House pass. </p> <p>Democrat bosses are bitter about that, but Nader just shrugs. Without him, he says, there was only a choice of two evils. Evil, whatever its shade, is still evil. President Gore would be an evil, too. \"Al Gore lost this election for Al Gore.\" Nader, with his calm fury and idealism, brought in hundreds of thousands of young people turned off by standard campaigning. He was an energising force (and a prophet his supporters keep comparing with Gandhi). </p> <p>Fair enough. But I went to Nader's last great Washington rally, almost as the polls opened a fortnight ago, and sat through four hours of oratory and ambition. I did not once hear the words \"global warming\" uttered. Nor \"ozone layer\". These were Green warriors who seemed more anxious to talk at length about statehood for the district of Columbia. These were environmentalists reserving their biggest cheers for legalising pot smoking. </p> <p>Now, of course, Nader does have the requisite policies somewhere in the greenhouse.

      "bodyText": "Let us for the moment leave chads, whether pregnant or dimpled, twisting in the wind. The supreme court of Florida is welcome to them. Something rather more serious - no, literally apocalyptic - lurks behind these frenzied American revels; something that, this week links Palm Beach and the Hague. A simple question: can democracy save the world? Guardian readers know that teams from 180 countries have gathered in Holland to try, one more time, to secure an agreement which reduces the greenhouse gas emissions that threaten the future of our globally warmed globe. Three years ago, in Kyoto, the leaders of those 180 countries solemnly promised to cut these emissions. They have not, however, been cut: they have risen. Even Kyoto, with the modest reductions it set, hasn't held. And, in particular, the US - with 5% of world population and 25% of emissions - has not kept to its word or the puny, insufficient targets it accepted in Japan. Unless the new rulers in Pennsylvania Avenue, whoever they turn out to be, can be persuaded to wake up and shape up, then we might as well not bother. A world environment policy without the polluter-in-chief is a hole in the head and a hole in the ozone layer. There will be no more important conference - for America or any of us - this year. Guardian readers know this because the Guardian reports it. American readers are less well served. In the US you may wade through dead forests of newsprint this morning without finding mention of the Hague. It might as well be happening on another planet, not the other side of our planet. And, anyway, George W Bush says he does not believe in global warming. He doesn't think it exists. Al Gore believes all right, yet he hasn't managed, over eight years in power, to do much about it. Hang on though! Isn't there, at last, a strong, growing American Green party now? And didn't it, in many ways, shape the whole presidential debate, raising causes that others feared to touch? Ralph Nader made the death penalty and privatised prisons and failed drug wars real issues. He put his old enemy, corporate power, in the firing line. It would have been a far poorer election without him. The thing that haunts me, 12 days on, is that it would also have been a different election. Without the irate grey panthers of Palm Beach waving their butterfly ballots, George W would already be far into his triumphant transition - and the clear divide between his victory or defeat was, and is, Nader's Green vote. We're talking 80,000-plus, not a frail 930. Nader, taking Florida Democrat votes quite disproportionately, filled out Bush's White House pass. Democrat bosses are bitter about that, but Nader just shrugs. Without him, he says, there was only a choice of two evils. Evil, whatever its shade, is still evil. President Gore would be an evil, too. \"Al Gore lost this election for Al Gore.\" Nader, with his calm fury and idealism, brought in hundreds of thousands of young people turned off by standard campaigning. He was an energising force (and a prophet his supporters keep comparing with Gandhi). Fair enough. But I went to Nader's last great Washington rally, almost as the polls opened a fortnight ago, and sat through four hours of oratory and ambition. I did not once hear the words \"global warming\" uttered. Nor \"ozone layer\". These were Green warriors who seemed more anxious to talk at length about statehood for the district of Columbia. These were environmentalists reserving their biggest cheers for legalising pot smoking. Now, of course, Nader does have the requisite policies somewhere in the greenhouse. Leaf through his position papers and you'll find him endorsing the standard Ozone Action programme and shredding Gore as an \"environment poseur\" playing a cynical con game. But he made precious little of it, one brick amongst many, at the close. The \"uncompromising political force\" he aimed to create was more interested in enfranchising Washington voters. Which is why I worry so deeply about what democracy can address, and what it can achieve, in a true environmental crisis. There are 90 or so Green parties around the world.

Eight per cent of incidents, 15 out of 195 errors, involved drugs given in doses 10 times too high or too low. </p> <p>No patient died as a result but two cases, involving the wrong concentration of an anti-cancer treatment and the intravenous infusion of a sedative that was 100 times too high, were said to have had the potential to cause serious harm. Three others could have had moderately serious consequences. </p> <p>Nearly 10% of the patients needed extra treatment or investigation, including, in four cases, an extra drug to mitigate the effects of the errors. </p> <p>The authors of the study, published in Archives of Diseases in Childhood, said those responsible for recording errors sometimes thought it was not worth telling parents about labelling errors noticed before drugs were given. In other cases, it was considered unnecessary to cause \"undue stress\" when the child had come to no harm. </p> <p>The researchers, from the department of child health at Glasgow University and the hospital's pharmacy department, say many hospitals have no system for reporting errors, unlike the Royal where there has been a mandatory scheme for years. This is to change soon when the NHS introduces compulsory national arrangements. </p> <p>More than half the mistakes involved intravenous treatments, including antibiotics, anti-viral medication, anti-cancer drugs and feeding fluids and a third involved oral medication. Most errors happened on the medical wards and were reported by nurses. </p> <p>The authors say it is important for staff to check calculations and avoid decimal points. Most errors were not down to negligence but organisational failures. </p> <p>In a commentary on the study, Terence Stephenson, of the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, suggests that, extrapolating the figures, there would be at least 1,675 avoidable medication errors a year involving children under 16 in English hospitals. Of those, 85 might involve moderate or severe reactions. The true figures were probably higher and although there had been no deaths in the Scottish study, fatalities did occur because of medication errors. </p> <p>Improvements could include standardisation of infusion pumps regulating intravenous treatments and more thorough checking of prescriptions and calculations.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Many parents are never told about errors in their children's hospital treatment, a study suggests today. Nearly half the families of patients who were administered the wrong medicine, given or prescribed the wrong dose, or drugged by the wrong route, were not informed of the mistakes, according to a review of errors over five years at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. Although the overall error rate was low - one per 662 admissions - 40% of the botched treatments involved children under two. Eight per cent of incidents, 15 out of 195 errors, involved drugs given in doses 10 times too high or too low. No patient died as a result but two cases, involving the wrong concentration of an anti-cancer treatment and the intravenous infusion of a sedative that was 100 times too high, were said to have had the potential to cause serious harm. Three others could have had moderately serious consequences. Nearly 10% of the patients needed extra treatment or investigation, including, in four cases, an extra drug to mitigate the effects of the errors. The authors of the study, published in Archives of Diseases in Childhood, said those responsible for recording errors sometimes thought it was not worth telling parents about labelling errors noticed before drugs were given. In other cases, it was considered unnecessary to cause \"undue stress\" when the child had come to no harm. The researchers, from the department of child health at Glasgow University and the hospital's pharmacy department, say many hospitals have no system for reporting errors, unlike the Royal where there has been a mandatory scheme for years. This is to change soon when the NHS introduces compulsory national arrangements. More than half the mistakes involved intravenous treatments, including antibiotics, anti-viral medication, anti-cancer drugs and feeding fluids and a third involved oral medication. Most errors happened on the medical wards and were reported by nurses. The authors say it is important for staff to check calculations and avoid decimal points. Most errors were not down to negligence but organisational failures. In a commentary on the study, Terence Stephenson, of the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, suggests that, extrapolating the figures, there would be at least 1,675 avoidable medication errors a year involving children under 16 in English hospitals. Of those, 85 might involve moderate or severe reactions. The true figures were probably higher and although there had been no deaths in the Scottish study, fatalities did occur because of medication errors. Improvements could include standardisation of infusion pumps regulating intravenous treatments and more thorough checking of prescriptions and calculations.",

Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the shadow strategic rail authority, will meet Railtrack's chairman, Sir Philip Beck, today and has another meeting planned with the new chief executive, Steven Marshall, for tomorrow. Mr Marshall, formerly Railtrack's finance director, was appointed on Friday after the unexpected resignation of Gerald Corbett a month after he first offered to go following the Hatfield crash. Although Mr Corbett insisted that his decision to quit was personal, speculation was growing that Mr Prescott had been angered by Mr Corbett's assertion that there was a conflict between safety, punctuality and reliability. The SSRA chief has been asked to find out if the new chief executive shares that view and will report to Mr Prescott in time for the weekly rail crisis meeting, now held by the government each Thursday. Mr Prescott told the BBC yesterday: \"My obligation is to see that Railtrack, whoever is the chief executive or chair, carry out their obligations.\" Sir Alastair, the former chairman of Eurotunnel who has a reputation as one of the toughest men in British business, is also understood to have been charged with ensuring that Railtrack recruits the right person as its next chairman. The authority is said to have little faith in the current board and could force a wholesale clearout. Sir Philip, who is to quit next year, has been widely criticised for his low profile.

      "bodyText": "Passengers on a flight from Newcastle to Paris were asked by their captain to leave their seats and gather at the front or the craft would lose balance and crash, it emerged yesterday. The 78 passengers and crew on Gill Airways flight AF5105 suspected a problem when the Fokker 100 began to vibrate around 90 minutes into its journey. As it prepared to land at Charles de Gaulle airport, the passengers were assured the shaking would stop and the plane would land safely if they and the five cabin crew took seats at the front of the plane to balance it out. The plane was travelling at 11,000ft but could not maintain its height. Passengers sat at the front for 15 minutes until it landed.They had been asked to occupy the few empty front seats on a flight that was around 80% full. Executives at the Tyneside airline, which operates an Air France franchise, had not identified the cause of the problem yesterday. However, nine days after the incident on November 3, the plane was back in service. Stan Abbott, a spokesman for Gill Airways, said: \"Passengers at the back of the plane were asked to go to sit in the empty seats at the front of the cabin. It was to assist with weight distribution, basically. I don't want to speculate with an investigation still ongoing, but the crucial thing is that the aircraft is back in service.\" He said the plane was back in use with the endorsement of the manufacturer and the air accident investigation branch of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions. Fittings such as the flight control computer had been replaced and Gill Airways continued to operate its fleet of three Fokker 100 aircraft in Air France colours. Mr Abbott added: \"The plane has operated without incident since.\" The department is investigating the incident, and a company insider said yesterday: \"I am concerned. There was no fault found by engineers, so the aircraft was sent flying again with passengers on board and still is. \"At the same time, teams of investigators are still trying to find out what caused it by going through the flight data recorder and flying the simulator.\"",

But the higher probability is that Europe's first postcommunist revolution against corruption, crony capitalism and flawed democracy will not be its last. jonathan.steele@theguardian.com",

The precise job toll was unclear but the highly paid traders, analysts and investment bankers of the ING Barings unit are expected to arrive at their desks this morning shocked by the revelation that the business's future is being reviewed. In a complete reversal of its strategy, Amsterdam-based ING last night appeared to signal the end of the operation it bought in 1995 for \u00a31 after \"rogue trader\" Nick Leeson ran up millions of pounds in losses in Singapore. Less than six months ago, ING bought stockbroker Charterhouse Securities in a move that was re garded as sign of commitment to the ING Barings operation by the Dutch bank. Last night, in a hastily prepared statement, the bank said: \"ING is reviewing the future position of its investment banking activities.\" It has appointed Goldman Sachs to find a buyer for its US operation while its European business is to be integrated into its \"wholesale\" banking business. The Asian, central European and Latin American businesses, however, are expected to emerge relatively unscathed. City sources said the new chairman, Ewald Kist, had been shocked by the wage bill of the investment bankers. A review had already been under way under the auspices of David Robins, the head of ING Barings, which took a knock during the Asian crisis three years ago. This latest review appeared deeper, however, even though ING tried to insist last night that the decision to review the future of the investment bank was one of its \"normal business assessments\". \"An update on the review process will be provided early next year at the latest,\" the bank said. Speculation about the long-term future of ING Barings is expected to prompt a swath of departures, even ahead of the annual bonus round. \"The big boys will just walk out,\" one senior source said.

He is suing Commerzbank for \u00a315m.</p> <p>But last night both sides were trying to reach an agreement which would keep secret the details of the way City salaries work.</p> <p>There is speculation that if he wins the case, Mr Duffield may attempt to lure away his former colleagues at Jupiter to New Star, an investment management firm he is setting up.</p> <p>While the case is expected to last several weeks, neither side has ruled out the possibility of reaching a settlement.</p> <p>Mr Duffield, who was chairman of the company, was dismissed following negotiations about the structure of the operation, and in particular about new pay and bonus arrangements, after Commerzbank took full control of the business early this year.</p> <p>It had owned 75% of the business and paid \u00a3500m for the remaining 25% owned by the Jupiter fund managers.</p> <p>Mr Duffield, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator, was said to have received \u00a3175m for his stake. He built up Jupiter from little more than a one-man operation into what was until recently Britain's most popular fund manager, known for its ubiquitous bill board advertisements depicting the planet Jupiter.</p> <p>The group manages more than \u00a315bn in funds.

      "bodyText": "A \u00a315m court case which could lift the veil of secrecy over lucrative City pay deals was on a knife-edge last night. John Duffield, the former head of fund management group Jupiter - one of the biggest sellers of Isas to small investors - was last night trying to thrash out a settlement with German Commerzbank over an unfair dismissal claim due to start in the high court this morning. Mr Duffield, who founded Jupiter in 1985, was ousted in May this year following a row over pay and bonuses. He is suing Commerzbank for \u00a315m. But last night both sides were trying to reach an agreement which would keep secret the details of the way City salaries work. There is speculation that if he wins the case, Mr Duffield may attempt to lure away his former colleagues at Jupiter to New Star, an investment management firm he is setting up. While the case is expected to last several weeks, neither side has ruled out the possibility of reaching a settlement. Mr Duffield, who was chairman of the company, was dismissed following negotiations about the structure of the operation, and in particular about new pay and bonus arrangements, after Commerzbank took full control of the business early this year. It had owned 75% of the business and paid \u00a3500m for the remaining 25% owned by the Jupiter fund managers. Mr Duffield, who has a reputation as a tough negotiator, was said to have received \u00a3175m for his stake. He built up Jupiter from little more than a one-man operation into what was until recently Britain's most popular fund manager, known for its ubiquitous bill board advertisements depicting the planet Jupiter. The group manages more than \u00a315bn in funds. Its best known product is the \u00a31.5bn Jupiter Income unit trust, held by more than 200,000 investors and managed by William Littlewood from 1991 until this year - when he quit because of problems with his health.",

      "body": "<p>It is a delightful conceit. As it yaws into view from the window of your incoming jet, the new Bilbao airport looks like a giant bird or plane that has made it to the ground shortly ahead of you. Perched on a virgin hillside site, untainted by the usual miasma of support buildings, Santiago Calatrava's operatic design, known locally as la paloma (the dove), is as precious as it is special. It has been designed - unlike, say, Heathrow or Gatwick, which have grown as if organically - as a gateway to the Basque capital, which in recent years has become a showcase for show-off contemporary architecture. </p> <p>The old airport was a low-set, dour affair. But then, although a fascinating city, the Bilbao of just 10 and 15 years ago was known (by those who didn't know it) for little more than oily docks, ETA, salted cod, failing heavy industry and a mysterious language as old as the taut muscle of stubby mountains that hides Euskadi from the rest of mainland Spain. </p> <p>In fact, Bilbao has never been less than fascinating, if a little secretive, in the past. The old city centre is a haunting gridded canyon of handsome stone buildings, of deep arcades sheltering coffee drinkers from the rain that falls in bucketloads. How there can be any left for the plains of Spain is quite beyond me. </p> <p>But, boy, when Bilbao got the modern bug and crept out from behind its defensive carapace a little more than a decade ago, it attracted some of the most magnetic new architecture anywhere in the world. The global tourist industry can't get enough of Frank Gehry's titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum; the new metro, an engineering marvel in a city dug into high rocks, has been given the Norman Foster treatment and is one of the finest and easiest to use anywhere in the world; restaurants and bars have smartened up their acts. Cesar Pelli, the architect who brought the Canary Wharf tower to London's Docklands, is designing a skyscraper for this groundscraping city, and Michael Wilford, architect of the Lowry centre in Salford, is to design the new railway station. And there's more to come. </p> <p>Spain has consistently produced some of the very best new buildings of the past 20 years, and remains the single most rewarding country for students of modern architecture. Much of the finest work, however, is, if not reserved, then quite severe and intellectually rigorous as befits the country that produced the cool magnificence of the Escorial, Philip II's palace outside Madrid. Bilbao, as usual, is slightly out of step: its new architecture is exuberant, and none more so than Calatrava's airport. </p> <p>Bird-like imagery has been used before, by Calatrava himself, as well as Eero Saarinen in his gull-wing TWA terminal (1962) at what was soon to be renamed John F Kennedy Airport, New York. Getting an airport to look like a bird or plane taking off or coming in to land could be a corny thing to do 40 years on from Saarinen, yet the conceit works well. It promises a poetic ascent into the realm of the sky gods, even if we know that the reality, sadly, is closer to a thrombosis- inducing trip in a bus with wings, with food that is neither ambrosia nor honey-dew, and with singed coffee and tea that tastes like tin. </p> <p>In this sense, Calatrava's airport is a brilliant lie: the building offers such things as dreams are flown on but that the airlines themselves cannot deliver, when so many people want to fly as frequently and as cheaply as possible. The airport, though, does its engaging best to redeem at least a part of the banality of modern air travel. It has a purity of vision that is rare in airport complexes: the four-storey car park, for instance, is tucked into a grassy embankment, out of sight and mind once the car has been abandoned. The departure hall - in the shape of a giant bird about to take flight - is a spectacular space that tries its best to lift passengers into the sky even before they have reached their plane. </p> <p>Unlike British airports, there are no shabby carpets with eye-jarring patterns: the floors are of shining marble. And, also unlike British airports, with their stink of burgers, lavatories and fetid, mechanically cooled air, Bilbao is clean: clear of visual clutter and awash with daylight. There are those working in the airport who say that the famous Spanish engineer has been given too much of a free hand, that the airport's architecture is so deterministic that it may prove to be incapable of adapting readily to change. </p> <p>Maybe. Yet, if change means - as it usually does in airports - more shops selling things you wouldn't normally want in a month of dumb days, more fast-food joints, more signs indicating even more exciting retail opportunities and generally more ways of making your journey longer and bittier, then it is rather comforting to know that Calatrava's all-of-a-piece design may yet resist such spoilsport developments. We'll see. </p> <p>The ribbed concrete wings of the departure hall roof lead the eye up, up and away into the sky beyond its lofty apex. On the ground, passengers reach the sky by way of the departure hall and the four-storey departure gallery that lies beyond it, connected to the aircraft by beaky steel gangways. The departure gallery is a triumph, a kind of racetrack grandstand where passengers can watch planes swoop up and out between green hills. Although the \u00a3130m airport is designed to handle 6m passengers a year, it may soon be coping with as many as 10m, and its light and airy design should enable it to deal with Bilbao's increasing importance as both a tourist attraction in its own right and as a junction box for crisscross European travel. </p> <p>Best of all is the sense all around you that this is a special building, designed to put a little mystery and magic back into air travel, even after you land: the baggage reclaim hall, with its mesmeric roof of arching concrete ribs, is like an air industry Aladdin's cave. Special, too, is the journey by road into the airport. You drive down towards it and can see quite clearly how Calatrava and his team have woven the building into its landscape in a way that actually enhances rather that detracts from the hillside scenery. For an airport this is quite something. </p> <p>Calatrava's designs can seem a bit over the top, especially in photographs; yet in reality they have a kind of 3-D cinematic quality that redeems them every time. His many bridges - such as the Almillo over the Guadalquivir, Seville (1992) or the Lusitania spanning the Guadiana, Merida (1991) - resemble giant musical instruments: harps, lyres. And his best buildings - Lyon-Satalas TGV station (1994) and the Wohlen High School, Aargau, Switzerland (1988) - have an anthropomorphic power brimming with barely restrained energy. The British have yet to take Calatrava to heart; his design for the Dartford river crossing, linking Kent and Essex, was rejected some years ago for a design that singularly fails to stir the imagination; and a sensational revamp of a tall, if dreary, City of London office block was watered down and then effectively abandoned. </p> <p>Calatrava's is a kind of Gotham City or Metropolis architecture, sometimes almost cartoony, yet never less than distinctive and stirring. As your jet makes its final approach, you can't help but look down on the new Bilbao airport and think: is it a bird, is it a plane?</p>",

      "body": "<p>Beneath the Wicklow Mountains, behind electric gates at the end of a mile-long driveway, lies Humewood Castle. Eithne Ni Bhraonain, better known as Enya, has come here to talk about A Day Without Rain, her first new album since 1995's The Memory of Trees. She lazes in front of a log fire, a velvet-clad, sparrow-like figure. She promptly ruins the effect by hacking a piece of well-worn chewing gum into a tissue. Enya, 39, is not one of life's natural gigglers, but she giggles anyway. </p> <p>Castles are so Enya that she has purchased one herself, Ayesha Castle in Killiney, south Dublin. On one side she overlooks the Wicklow Mountains, on another, the Irish Sea. \"It's very castle on the exterior,\" she says, \"but it's very much a home inside. It's actually a very small castle and I fell in love with it.\" </p> <p>Enya's fortress - still being renovated three years after she purchased it for \u00a32.5m - towers over Bono's compound, in much the same way as her sales have towered over U2's since she sold the first of 44m non-soundtrack albums in 1988. \"When I first walked in, someone said it overlooked Bono's,\" she smiles wryly, eyebrows slowly rising. \"I thought, 'Hmm, so it does.' \" </p> <p>Enya's operation is tight-knit. Enya herself composes. Her manager Nicky Ryan arranges and produces. Ryan's poet wife Roma - who so closely resembles an older Enya that in some circles she is referred to as the \"stunt double\" - is responsible for the lyrics. Outsiders are unwelcome. \"I don't like anybody else's opinion,\" she states firmly. </p> <p>Enya is shy, but she is also not to be trifled with. Last month, in a move that harked back to more extravagant days, her record company stopped river traffic on the Thames to launch A Day Without Rain with a fireworks display. Enya was heard to remark how spectacular it all was, but that the money would have been better spent on point-of-sale displays in record shops. </p> <p>From the very beginning, she has been an aloof, mysterious figure, untarnished by scandal. She is simply there: the blankest of canvases, rather quietly selling millions of albums (her publicity material claims that total sales of her recordings rival those of Cher, Tina Turner, Madonna and Whitney Houston). If the plan was to ensure that the artist's personality never obscured the artist's music, it has worked spectacularly well. \"My private lifestyle bothers a lot of people,\" she sighs. \"It's not a hanging offence not wanting to go to nightclubs. What happened to choice? My choice is that after a certain amount of promotion, I feel it gets very false and then I'm not interested. When the album has been out for, say, 10 months, people will start focusing on me and I really don't want that. I love the music to be known, but I'm not after fame for myself.\" </p> <p>Enya's life was always musical. Her father, Lee O, was a Donegal showband leader, while her mother Marie was a music teacher. In 1970, two of her four older brothers, one of her four older sisters and two cousins formed Clannad, who enjoyed moderate suc cess in Ireland and abroad. A decade later, Nicky Ryan, Clannad's manager, soundman and producer, invited Enya, now classically trained, to join Clannad.

      "bodyText": "Beneath the Wicklow Mountains, behind electric gates at the end of a mile-long driveway, lies Humewood Castle. Eithne Ni Bhraonain, better known as Enya, has come here to talk about A Day Without Rain, her first new album since 1995's The Memory of Trees. She lazes in front of a log fire, a velvet-clad, sparrow-like figure. She promptly ruins the effect by hacking a piece of well-worn chewing gum into a tissue. Enya, 39, is not one of life's natural gigglers, but she giggles anyway. Castles are so Enya that she has purchased one herself, Ayesha Castle in Killiney, south Dublin. On one side she overlooks the Wicklow Mountains, on another, the Irish Sea. \"It's very castle on the exterior,\" she says, \"but it's very much a home inside. It's actually a very small castle and I fell in love with it.\" Enya's fortress - still being renovated three years after she purchased it for \u00a32.5m - towers over Bono's compound, in much the same way as her sales have towered over U2's since she sold the first of 44m non-soundtrack albums in 1988. \"When I first walked in, someone said it overlooked Bono's,\" she smiles wryly, eyebrows slowly rising. \"I thought, 'Hmm, so it does.' \" Enya's operation is tight-knit. Enya herself composes. Her manager Nicky Ryan arranges and produces. Ryan's poet wife Roma - who so closely resembles an older Enya that in some circles she is referred to as the \"stunt double\" - is responsible for the lyrics. Outsiders are unwelcome. \"I don't like anybody else's opinion,\" she states firmly. Enya is shy, but she is also not to be trifled with. Last month, in a move that harked back to more extravagant days, her record company stopped river traffic on the Thames to launch A Day Without Rain with a fireworks display. Enya was heard to remark how spectacular it all was, but that the money would have been better spent on point-of-sale displays in record shops. From the very beginning, she has been an aloof, mysterious figure, untarnished by scandal. She is simply there: the blankest of canvases, rather quietly selling millions of albums (her publicity material claims that total sales of her recordings rival those of Cher, Tina Turner, Madonna and Whitney Houston). If the plan was to ensure that the artist's personality never obscured the artist's music, it has worked spectacularly well. \"My private lifestyle bothers a lot of people,\" she sighs. \"It's not a hanging offence not wanting to go to nightclubs. What happened to choice? My choice is that after a certain amount of promotion, I feel it gets very false and then I'm not interested. When the album has been out for, say, 10 months, people will start focusing on me and I really don't want that. I love the music to be known, but I'm not after fame for myself.\" Enya's life was always musical. Her father, Lee O, was a Donegal showband leader, while her mother Marie was a music teacher. In 1970, two of her four older brothers, one of her four older sisters and two cousins formed Clannad, who enjoyed moderate suc cess in Ireland and abroad. A decade later, Nicky Ryan, Clannad's manager, soundman and producer, invited Enya, now classically trained, to join Clannad. Two years, two albums and several tours later, Ryan quit Clannad with his protegee. \"He loved the way Clannad harmonised,\" recalls Enya, \"but he had this idea about recording a voice and layering it. He suggested I harmonise with myself and build it up spontaneously.\" It sounded vague, but Enya intuitively understood what Ryan was searching for. Roma Ryan enticed David Puttnam to use Enya on his 1985 film The Frog Prince. The BBC commissioned her for an episode of The Celts in 1987.

Turnout in US presidential elections has been falling more or less steadily since 1960.

Here in western Europe turnout levels average close to 80%. On this side of the Atlantic, democracy is alive and well.</p> <p>It is a comforting myth but myth it is. Take European-level elections. In the 1999 contest for the European parliament, turnout in one ward in the north of England was 1.7%: of the 1,000 or so registered voters 17 actually took part. Although an extreme example, this was indicative of lack of interest in the European polls.</p> <p>Across the UK as a whole, turnout in 1999 reached just 24%. In the Netherlands it was 30%, in Germany 45%. No other election in any of these countries had ever met with such popular indifference.</p> <p>European elections are unique, of course. They choose representatives with little control over the European executive, whether in the form of commission or council of ministers. They are held simultaneously in 15 countries, each of which is busy with its own particular national agenda. They are contested by parties that take their terms of reference from national politics, often scarcely making reference to issues that will be dealt with in the European parliament. Finally, they involve candidates who seek to assign legitimacy to an institution that has become notorious, perhaps unjustly, for feather-bedding its occupants. That voters should prove indifferent is hardly surprising.</p> <p>Elections inside the nation states of Europe are a different matter, of course. But even here there is less and less reason for democrats to be complacent. For although levels of turnout in national elections in most European countries might still be regarded as impressively high, they are also tending to fall. In their most recent national elections many European countries registered record low levels of participation. In 1999 Austria, Finland and Iceland recorded their lowest ever postwar turnouts. The Netherlands and Sweden reached their nadir in 1998, as did the UK and Ireland in 1997. Italy did so in 1996.</p> <p>Nor are these simply one-off exceptions. Average turnout in national elections in western Europe has been falling slowly but consistently since the 1960s. Then, an average of more than 85% of eligible voters in the countries of Europe cast their votes in national elections - nearly 90% in Germany and more than that in the Netherlands. In the 1970s, this fell very slightly to just under 85% and then to just under 83% in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the drop was even bigger, falling noticeably below 80% for the first time in postwar history. Look at the Netherlands again - a drop of nearly 20%. The UK has, by contrast, proved relatively stable over the 40 years. (But note how European averages in the 90s are still high by comparison with the US.)</p> <p>It is also noteworthy that the fall has been reasonably consistent across the different countries. In other words, not only do the 1990s record the lowest average turnout across western Europe as a whole, they also record the lowest average turnout in the vast majority of the individual countries. This itself is unusual, if only because it has usually been impossible to find trends that are common across so many different countries. Yet we see turnout hitting decade lows in the 1990s in polities as diverse as Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - countries where the ideological profile of the parties are quite different.</p> <p>The only countries to buck the trend are Belgium, where voting is compulsory and almost invariant; Malta, which now records the highest turnout of any democracy; and the UK itself, where the record decade low was recorded in the 1980s, during the halcyon years of the Thatcher government.</p> <p>Switzerland is the one country that comes anywhere near the levels of disengagement in America - not much more than 40% participated in national elections in the 1990s. But there referendums are a key instrument of democratic control.</p> <p>So are we in Europe following the American way in electoral behaviour? In the context of what John Kenneth Galbraith called the culture of contentment, in a world in which competing political leaders seem less and less easy to differentiate, citizens appear to be becoming increasingly indifferent to politics. But won't they then also become increasingly indifferent to democracy itself? Whatever they do in the US, here in Europe there is little to be smug about.</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Mair is professor of comparative politics at Leiden University in the Netherlands.<br></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Mair@fsw.leidenuniv.nl\">Mair@fsw.leidenuniv.nl</a></p>",

Yet we see turnout hitting decade lows in the 1990s in polities as diverse as Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - countries where the ideological profile of the parties are quite different. The only countries to buck the trend are Belgium, where voting is compulsory and almost invariant; Malta, which now records the highest turnout of any democracy; and the UK itself, where the record decade low was recorded in the 1980s, during the halcyon years of the Thatcher government. Switzerland is the one country that comes anywhere near the levels of disengagement in America - not much more than 40% participated in national elections in the 1990s. But there referendums are a key instrument of democratic control. So are we in Europe following the American way in electoral behaviour? In the context of what John Kenneth Galbraith called the culture of contentment, in a world in which competing political leaders seem less and less easy to differentiate, citizens appear to be becoming increasingly indifferent to politics. But won't they then also become increasingly indifferent to democracy itself? Whatever they do in the US, here in Europe there is little to be smug about. \u0095 Peter Mair is professor of comparative politics at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Mair@fsw.leidenuniv.nl",

      "bodyText": "An Israeli diplomat was wounded by a gunman in the Jordanian capital, Amman, yesterday, reawakening fears that the violence in the West Bank and Gaza may spread. Foreign ministry officials in Jerusalem said the Israeli deputy consul Yoram Havivian was injured when a man opened fire on his car with an assault rifle yesterday morning. He was treated for cuts and returned to Israel. Jordan promised to catch his assailant. It was the first attack on an Israeli envoy in Jordan for a year, although there have been weeks of violent demonstrations by the kingdom's large population of Palestinian refugees. Jordan has come under pressure from other Arab states to cut its ties with Israel, with which it signed a peace treaty in 1994. Two previously unknown groups, the Jordanian Islamic Resistance Movement for Struggle and the Group of the Holy Warrior Ahmed al-Daqamsah, called after the Jordanian soldier who killed seven Israeli schoolgirls three years ago, claimed responsibility. The shooting threatened the mood of cautious optimism which has grown in Israeli officials with the reduction in violence since the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, issued a call for restraint. On the same day Israel plucked the former president Ezer Weizman from retirement for a meeting with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, who exerts a great deal of influence over Mr Arafat. Mr Weizman, who shepherded Israel to a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, spent more than two hours with Mr Mubarak at the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Mr Arafat is to visit Sharm tomorrow. Mr Weizman said he hoped Mr Mubarak could prevail on Mr Arafat to enforce his ban on opening fire from areas under full Palestinian control, such as Beit Jalla, from where gunmen regularly fire on the Jewish settlement of Gilo, outside Jerusalem. Israel has unleashed harsh retribution for the gunfire against the residents of Beit Jalla, an easier target than the mobile, lightly armed gunmen. Yesterday, Palestinian officials outlawed gunfire at demonstrations and funerals and banned schoolchildren from taking part in protests. Shops were ordered to resume normal hours. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, responded by telling his weekly cabinet meeting that the army would not retaliate for Saturday's ambush in the Gaza Strip, which killed one soldier and wounded two others.",

Four deaths in Tyrolean avalanches yesterday added to the fears generated by the mountain train inferno near Salzburg which killed 155 skiers and snowboarders a week earlier. Tourist chiefs throughout the country are reeling as an increasing number of holidaymakers cancel their Austrian bookings and choose to ski elsewhere. In and around Kaprun, the all-year skiing resort where the train caught fire last weekend, tour operators and hoteliers say that up to 90% have cancelled. The area is a jewel in the crown of Austrian winter sports, generating an annual turnover of about \u00a3175m. Tourism officials met in Salzburg last week for crisis talks on how to cushion the blow to the industry, which has suffered a large number of disasters in recent years. Their most significant decision was to cancel all tourism advertising for the rest of the season as a \"sign of piety\". \"It is a nationwide tragedy,\" the tourism minister, Mares Rossmann, said. But she added that the industry was \"resilient\" and would \"bounce back fast\". Now empty of tourists and journalists, Kaprun is beginning to feel the weight of a burden it will probably carry for years. The town has 3,000 residents and more than twice that number of beds to fill, and its tourist office is on the defensive. \"The tourist industry accounts for 75-80% of our economy,\" said Christian Pfeffer, the deputy tourism director. \"What's now important is to give visitors a sense of security and to be upfront about what's happened.\" So what does he tell the many thousands of people who have been calling in with enquiries? \"We tell them there has been a tragic fire, a tragedy in a tunnel and not outside.

The sacking, for characteristically blunt remarks made in a newspaper interview in which he criticised government labour reforms and cabinet colleagues, comes just three days ahead of a crucial visit to the Greek capital by a delegation from the International Olympic Committee headed by Jacques Rogge, the IOC vice-president. Mr Rogge will be looking for assurances that Athens is back on track after a catalogue of delays and personnel changes that have put the city's ability to stage the games into serious doubt. In April, the IOC president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, said that Greece was so far behind in its preparations that it was heading towards the \"danger zone\", where the Olympics could be given to another city. Mr Simitis then appointed himself head of a new government co-ordinating committee and brought in the flamboyant Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, who had fronted Greece's winning bid in 1997, to head the organising committee. IOC leaders meeting in Warsaw last week acknowledged the progress made since then and said Athens could hold \"excellent games\". But the bickering among Greece's ministers - many of whom were suspicious, even jealous, of Angelopoulos's role - did not stop, prompting the IOC to call for a truce. With the IOC team about to arrive in Athens, an increasingly exasperated Mr Simitis was determined to show that his government was unified, sources said last night. \"A minister cannot hold a public dispute with the government, and cannot use reprehensible language against his colleagues,\" Mr Simitis said. In an interview with the Sunday paper Ethnos, Mr Pangalos had questioned the socialist government's proposed labour reforms - which have sparked a wave of strikes across the country - and charged the foreign minister, George Papandreou, with naivety for his dealings with Turkey. It is the second time that Mr Simitis has sacked Mr Pangalos. In 1999, the veteran politician was removed from his post as foreign minister for his part in a bungled attempt to offer sanctuary to the fugitive Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. The burly 62-year-old has an impressive record of gaffes and his appointment as culture minister following national elections in April raised more than a few eyebrows.

      "body": "<p>Bill Clinton ended his three days in Vietnam last night with the tide of popular support for his visit still apparently surging. But the enthusiasm masked dangerous undercurrents which suggested that the trip had been less than a total triumph.</p> <p>Mr Clinton spent yesterday in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, once the capital of South Vietnam and now the country's business hub. Had the security men allowed it, he would have been mobbed once more by delighted crowds.</p> <p>But, as Air Force One took off for Washington, the response of his official hosts was somewhat colder.</p> <p>Local television did not show the delighted crowds in the streets. And Mr Clinton's earlier calls for greater democracy have left some bruises on Vietnam's Communist leaders. Le Kha Phieu, the party secretary general, who is regarded as the most powerful figure in the country, resurrected the word \"imperialists\" to describe the Americans. He is reported to have told the president: \"We respect other nations' way of life and political systems. We also demand that other nations respect our country's political system and choices.\" Mr Clinton called their discussion \"a nice little debate\".</p> <p>He leaves Vietnam heading joltingly towards economic, if not political, liberalisation. But the tone adopted by his hosts suggests that the process is not necessarily helped by American hectoring.</p> <p>\"There is no question there is still a different vision of economics at the highest level of government,\" Mr Clinton's chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said.</p> <p>\"There is a notable difference of philosophy.\"</p> <p>Several smaller incidents suggest that the Americans are as indelicate about Vietnamese sensibilities as they were in the old days.</p> <p>Mr Clinton was horribly late for his night at the Hanoi opera house on Friday, keeping everyone waiting.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton ended his three days in Vietnam last night with the tide of popular support for his visit still apparently surging. But the enthusiasm masked dangerous undercurrents which suggested that the trip had been less than a total triumph. Mr Clinton spent yesterday in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, once the capital of South Vietnam and now the country's business hub. Had the security men allowed it, he would have been mobbed once more by delighted crowds. But, as Air Force One took off for Washington, the response of his official hosts was somewhat colder. Local television did not show the delighted crowds in the streets. And Mr Clinton's earlier calls for greater democracy have left some bruises on Vietnam's Communist leaders. Le Kha Phieu, the party secretary general, who is regarded as the most powerful figure in the country, resurrected the word \"imperialists\" to describe the Americans. He is reported to have told the president: \"We respect other nations' way of life and political systems. We also demand that other nations respect our country's political system and choices.\" Mr Clinton called their discussion \"a nice little debate\". He leaves Vietnam heading joltingly towards economic, if not political, liberalisation. But the tone adopted by his hosts suggests that the process is not necessarily helped by American hectoring. \"There is no question there is still a different vision of economics at the highest level of government,\" Mr Clinton's chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said. \"There is a notable difference of philosophy.\" Several smaller incidents suggest that the Americans are as indelicate about Vietnamese sensibilities as they were in the old days. Mr Clinton was horribly late for his night at the Hanoi opera house on Friday, keeping everyone waiting. The tableau on Saturday night when he solemnly presided over the return of some bone shards wrapped in the Stars and Stripes seemed merely to emphasise the difference in weight accorded to the 58,000 American war dead compared to the millions of dead Vietnamese. And there was a little argument between two security men about some detail of crowd positioning that seemed to sum up everything. It ended with an American shrug. \"It's your country,\" the American said to the Vietnamese official, before adding: \"But you're wrong.\" That is the US view of Vietnam in a nutshell. As in Hanoi, most of Mr Clinton's fans on the streets here were under 25, and thus born after the war. But northern youngsters grew up being told that the Americans were bombers, killers. Many southerners fought alongside them in what was, after all, primarily a civil war. Their folk memory is tinged with nostalgia, handed down by parents who saw the GIs as friends and patrons. \"My father fought with the Americans,\" said Cheong, a T-shirt seller, as he waited for the motorcade. \"Good people, good people.\" He sounded wistful. Many of the older generation in the south died; many have emigrated; the rest keep their heads below the parapet. But the entrepreneurial spirit remains strong here, and the president devoted most of the day to economic themes, backed by a little light shopping. He certainly could not have done much sightseeing. The Museum of Chinese and American War Crimes has changed its name to the War Remnants Museum, but the principle is the same: captured tanks and reproachful messages. Other guidebook suggestions are the Revolutionary Museum, the Ho Chi Minh Museum, the No 7 Army Museum, the Cu Chi tunnels (a Viet Cong stronghold which the US could never overrun), the People's Committee Building and the Binh Soup Shop, which was the Viet Cong's secret wartime headquarters. Instead, Mr Clinton made his setpiece appearance far from the city centre, at the new freight terminal as the guest of the US shipping company APL: American President Lines.

His criticism is contained in excerpts from his diary published in the newspaper Welt am Sonntag. They provide the first written account of Mr Kohl's reaction to the unfolding of the illicit party funding affair that led to his resignation as honorary party chairman last year. Showing only mild remorse for the fact that he had illegally channelled more than \u00a3600,000 in undisclosed donations into party funds, Mr Kohl denied allegations that he had accepted cash in return for political favours. Instead, he lashed out at his critics, the media and senior CDU members. \"They are engaged in an attempt to portray me as a corrupt and power hungry politician. The aim of this campaign is to criminalise me and to discredit my 16 years as chancellor,\" he wrote. \"I will not permit this. I will fight with every means at my disposal to defend my domestic and foreign policy successes and our struggle to find the best political solution for Germany and Europe.\" Some of the most damaging criticism was reserved for his two successors as CDU leader, his former close adviser Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, and the current CDU leader Angela Merkel, who was appointed early this year in an attempt to show that the party had made a clean break with the Kohl era. At the height of the scandal last December Mrs Merkel, who was then CDU general secretary, published an attack on Mr Kohl in the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, demanding his resignation from political office to prevent the party's image being further tarnished. In yesterday's diary account, Mr Kohl accused both Mr Scha\u00fcble, then CDU party leader, and Mrs Merkel of in effect plotting his downfall. In an entry dated \"Christmas 1999\" he wrote: \"It is becoming increasingly clear that this is a prearranged game with separate parts being played by the general secretary and the party leader.\" Mr Kohl made several bitter comments about Mrs Merkel, a former east German politician who was brought into Mr Kohl's cabinet after reunification in 1990. \"If I had not voted clearly in her favour, this woman from the political fringe would not have been able to make her exemplary political career,\" he wrote. \"I supported her for years and to such an extent that cabinet colleagues would say behind my back that Mrs Merkel could do anything because I was besotted by her.\" Mrs Merkel made no comment about Mr Kohl's revelations yesterday. The publication of the diary, which is due to be serialised daily by Die Welt this week, has come at an awkward moment for Germany's main opposition party and Mrs Merkel herself. The CDU has not fully recovered from the Kohl scandal and is still lagging six percentage points behind the ruling Social Democrats in the opinion polls. Mrs Merkel's inability to reverse her party's popularity slide have diminished her chances of becoming the CDU's chancellor candidate for the 2002 general election. The party is expected to select a candidate early next year. In an attempt to restore its relations with Mr Kohl, the CDU allowed him to return to his seat in parliament in September. The slush fund affair is far from being resolved, however. The parliamentary committee investigating it has yet to establish whether bribes influenced the Kohl government's decision to sell tanks to Saudi Arabia in 1990. It also wants to find out whether backhanders were paid during the 1993 sale of the giant east German Leuna oil refinery to the French petrochemical concern Elf Aquitaine.",

Many party leaders from that era are still in powerful government positions. President Ricardo Lagos, a socialist, who is not implicated in the scandal, is under pressure from congress to investigate current CIA activities in Chile. \"I'm not naive. I know that intelligence practices - to put it elegantly - or spying are as old as humanity,\" he said. \"But I would hope that this is a throwback to the cold war, and it doesn't happen any more, because it can affect relations between countries.\" The documents are allowing historians to piece together the secret diplomacy used by the US to set the stage for a coup, then to prop up the military junta leader Augusto Pinochet throughout his 1973-1990 rule. They include previously unknown details about the workings of the Pinochet regime, including the dictator's role in foreign assassinations and his troubled attempts to travel abroad as the legal net tightened around him in the early 1990's. The Chilean government says it will formally protest at the US interference, and the leading newspaper El Mercurio has tried to limit the fallout from the revelation that it received about $1.6m (\u00a31m) in covert support from US agents. El Mercurio was a leading critic of the government of Salvador Allende, and a crucial cog in the CIA's propaganda machine. The documents - many of them heavily censored - released by the US state department, the defence intelligence agency, the CIA, the FBI and the justice department are the fourth and last round of disclosures ordered by President Clinton. They cover US activities in Chile in 1968-1991. Approximately 1,400 CIA documents were released after the Clinton administration spent months overcoming the reluctance of the agency's director, George Tenet. \"The CIA as an institution suffers form a pathology of secrecy,\" said Peter Kornbluh of the National Security Archives, a research institution in Washington. \"It is as difficult for them to give up a document as it is for a child to share a toy.\" Gen Pinochet is under court supervision in Chile, where he is being investigated for nearly 200 criminal offences. The new documents may also prompt the US to request his extradition, since they include evidence of his direct role in the car bombing of the Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976. While the US efforts to overthrow the democratically elected Allende and support Gen Pinochet are hardly secrets, the details show the extent to which US officials were willing to abuse Chilean sovereignty. A CIA memo prepared three years before the 1973 coup states: \"If civil disorders were to follow from a military action, the USG [US Government] would promptly deliver necessary support and material, (but not personnel).\" In a state department memo written weeks after the coup that put Gen Pinochet in power, Jack Kubisch wrote: \"The junta does not appear to represent a threat to our major national interest.

      "bodyText": "Pursued by a snowballing corruption scandal involving his disgraced spy chief, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru confirmed early today that he would resign. He told ministers of his decision from Tokyo, where he arrived on Thursday. A statement issued from his hotel room, which was guarded by the police, said he would resign within 48 hours. He said he was acting in response to \"the new composition of the forces in congress\". The Peruvian congress reverted to opposition control on Thursday for the first time in eight years and reinstated three constitutional court judges sacked in May. Mr Fujimori's immediate future remains unclear. He refused to say if he would return to Peru after his resignation is submitted, or seek political asylum in Japan, the homeland of his parents. Since taking office in July 1990, when he was the almost unknown rector of an agrarian university, Mr Fujimori has been both hailed and reviled for ruling Peru with an iron fist. His maverick style, a mixture of populism and authoritarianism, prompted him to carry out a coup in April 1992, when he dissolved congress and sacked supreme court judges. His tough treatment of suspected rebels was credited with quashing a bloody insurgency, and he was lauded for putting Peru back on an economic even keel by slashing hyperinflation with tight fiscal policies. But he was increasingly criticised for giving free rein to what critics called \"the obscure power\" of the secret service. He also pushed through constitutional reform to allow his third, controversial election in May 2000 in a dubious polling process marred by dirty tricks and claims of fraud. His government has been falling to pieces since his former spy chief and key personal adviser Vladimiro Montesinos was exposed as the alleged chief of a vast money laundering ring involved in arms-trafficking, blackmail, corruption and fleecing drugs traffickers. The special prosecutor for the Montesinos case, Jose Ugaz, has said there is no evidence incriminating Mr Fuji mori, but he will investigate claims by Roberto Escobar, brother of the late Colombian drugs baron Pablo Escobar, that he gave Mr Montesinos \u00a3700,000 to fund the 1990 campaign. The crisis was triggered by the release on September 14 of a video that showed Mr Montesinos handing a congressman a wad of dollar bills, apparently to seal his defection from the opposition to the government benches. During the 1990s Mr Fujimori ceded to Mr Montesinos control of appointments in the armed forces and of the all-pervasive secret police. His adviser built up a spider's web of influence in the courts, the media, the cabinet and congress through a mixture of favours and blackmail. But in the past two months Mr Fujimori's grip on power slipped. The crisis came to a head when Mr Montesinos flew back to Peru, prompting Mr Fujimori to embark on a showy but failed manhunt for his ex-adviser. It looks likely that the second vice-president, Ricardo Marquez, will assume the presidency if the first vice-president, Francisco Tudela, who resigned in protest at Mr Montesinos' return, declines the post. Fernando Olivera, leader of the Independent Moralising Front, the opposition party which leaked the fateful video, said Mr Fujimori's resignation was \"great news for Peru\" and served to confirm Mr Fujimori's responsibility for the mafia-style management of Peru in the past 10 years But an opposition MP, Absalon Vasquez, said that Mr Fujimori was \"the greatest president Peru ever had\".",

      "body": "<p>David Boies, the grinning lawyer with the frayed edges whose job it is to talk Al Gore into the White House, likes to gamble in casinos.</p> <p>The 59-year-old advocate for mostly liberal causes is out of luck in Tallahassee, Florida's state capital: it just isn't that sort of place. But he gets to indulge his instincts today as the lead lawyer for the Democrats in the state supreme court, where the Gore campaign is fighting to have recounted votes added to the final tally.</p> <p>Mr Boies is something of a contradiction. He headed the legal team in the US government's anti-trust case against Microsoft, yet before that he acted for the defence when the government brought an anti-trust case against IBM.</p> <p>He represented Napster, which allowed people to trade music on the internet for free, yet he does not use a personal computer and has his family and secretary check his emails.</p> <p>His appearance barely reflects his fees of about $700 an hour. The blue suits come off the peg at $200 a piece, the knit-tie is wound into a big knot, sports shoes are on his feet and his wispy hair sticks out at the back. This leaves the man with the Timex watch worn over his sleeve with plenty for the craps table.</p> <p>\"It is the casino game that you have the best chance of winning,\" he says of the pastime that helps him to relax. \"The second thing is that, perfectly played, it's pure luck. It's literally a roll of the dice.\"</p> <p>Mr Boies, a Yale graduate whose team will have an hour to make its case in the supreme court today, labours under what might to others be an insurmountable handicap: he is dyslexic. \"He overcompensates with an overwhelming memory,\" says his wife, Mary, who is also a lawyer.</p> <p>He will need it if the legal aspects of the post-presidential deadlock endure for as long as he suggests. \"You don't call the end of the game after the first innings or the second innings,\" he says.</p> <p>Mr Boies's main opponent today is likely to be Barry Richard, whose tongue is reputed to be as silvered as his generous mane of hair. Even though he is the lead advocate for the George W Bush campaign, the 58-year-old Tallahassee attorney is a registered Democrat.</p> <p>Mr Richard's strength is in his local Florida connections. He is the son of a former mayor of Miami Beach, was a member of the state legislature for four years in the 1970s and is considered an expert in open meetings and public records law. But he has also won three cases in the US supreme court.</p> <p>\"He's one of the sharpest people I know,\" says Dick Shelton, director of the Florida Press Association, for which he has long been a lobbyist. \"He's brilliant and has a great analytical mind. If I was in trouble, he's the one I'd hire to represent me.\"</p> <p>Whatever happens in court today, somebody will still be in trouble.

      "bodyText": "David Boies, the grinning lawyer with the frayed edges whose job it is to talk Al Gore into the White House, likes to gamble in casinos. The 59-year-old advocate for mostly liberal causes is out of luck in Tallahassee, Florida's state capital: it just isn't that sort of place. But he gets to indulge his instincts today as the lead lawyer for the Democrats in the state supreme court, where the Gore campaign is fighting to have recounted votes added to the final tally. Mr Boies is something of a contradiction. He headed the legal team in the US government's anti-trust case against Microsoft, yet before that he acted for the defence when the government brought an anti-trust case against IBM. He represented Napster, which allowed people to trade music on the internet for free, yet he does not use a personal computer and has his family and secretary check his emails. His appearance barely reflects his fees of about $700 an hour. The blue suits come off the peg at $200 a piece, the knit-tie is wound into a big knot, sports shoes are on his feet and his wispy hair sticks out at the back. This leaves the man with the Timex watch worn over his sleeve with plenty for the craps table. \"It is the casino game that you have the best chance of winning,\" he says of the pastime that helps him to relax. \"The second thing is that, perfectly played, it's pure luck. It's literally a roll of the dice.\" Mr Boies, a Yale graduate whose team will have an hour to make its case in the supreme court today, labours under what might to others be an insurmountable handicap: he is dyslexic. \"He overcompensates with an overwhelming memory,\" says his wife, Mary, who is also a lawyer. He will need it if the legal aspects of the post-presidential deadlock endure for as long as he suggests. \"You don't call the end of the game after the first innings or the second innings,\" he says. Mr Boies's main opponent today is likely to be Barry Richard, whose tongue is reputed to be as silvered as his generous mane of hair. Even though he is the lead advocate for the George W Bush campaign, the 58-year-old Tallahassee attorney is a registered Democrat. Mr Richard's strength is in his local Florida connections. He is the son of a former mayor of Miami Beach, was a member of the state legislature for four years in the 1970s and is considered an expert in open meetings and public records law. But he has also won three cases in the US supreme court. \"He's one of the sharpest people I know,\" says Dick Shelton, director of the Florida Press Association, for which he has long been a lobbyist. \"He's brilliant and has a great analytical mind. If I was in trouble, he's the one I'd hire to represent me.\" Whatever happens in court today, somebody will still be in trouble. Perhaps, if it is Mr Boies, he will seek solace in his love of country music, specifically Hank Williams, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. Somewhere in his photographic memory will be lodged one of Nelson's greatest songs: Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground.",

This is intriguingly candid as the narrative-driving chap - Patrick Standish - is a remorseless philanderer who treats a provincial virgin, Jenny Bunn, like ground to be seized in a war. </p> <p>In 1960, he deals with objections from his American publisher to the novel's tone. Two key scenes - Standish's fling with another woman while courting Jenny and Miss Bunn's eventual submission while drunk - are regarded by the Manhattan book-man as \"more depressing than comic\" ... \"turned my stomach a bit\". Amis's reply is that \"he hoped for some pretty dark places in the comedy\". </p> <p>Four decades later - with the English novel's trip to those dark places completed by Kingsley's son, Martin - it's a measure of how laughter has darkened in contemporary fiction that Take A Girl Like You now serves on television as genteel nostalgia. </p> <p>There's American money in this, and so perhaps rather too much is made of Julian the toff in his country house (the Letters reveal that a friend of Amis's thought this the weakest part of the book), but the delineation of class and accents is in general subtle, and the picture of England in the 50s feels as if it would satisfy historians as well as American viewers who know the country through Agatha Christie and Princess Diana. </p> <p>Take A Girl Like You is the kind of series in which the set-dresser is as important as the director. Most scenes depend on a period detail: Morgan sports cars, scratchy lavatory paper, a needle skidding on the shellac of a 78 record, French films being chic or an English cuisine still shaped by rationing. With its sax-and-drum jazz soundtrack, it also deliberately has the feel of a 50s film. </p> <p>But the book and the adaptation are most interesting as erotic history. Take A Girl Like You has the feel of a brother-piece to the Larkin poem in which he envies the sexual freedom of his students and laments that \"sexual intercourse began in 1963... rather late for me\". </p> <p>David Lodge once said that the advantage of writing Catholic novels in the 60s was that, post-Chatterley, this was the last area of fiction in which the stakes remained high in sexual encounters: virginity, contraception and adultery were still an issue. With even many adherents of Rome now lax in these matters, writers must travel to the past in the hope of sexual tension. </p> <p>Take A Girl Like You trembles with bottled-up longing. In a TV environment in which the characters usually travel from first kiss through ripped-off clothes to orgasm in about half a minute, there's a novelty in seeing sex scenes in which the foreplay resembles chess. Fingers inch towards a move and then rethink it or are checked by the opponent. The lingo of sexual negotiation - the woman wanting \"it\" to be \"special\", the man apologising for \"making a complete fool of myself\" when he makes a touch too far - are captured with anthropological relish in the script by Andrew Davies, who previously adapted Amis's The Old Devils for TV with some success. The sexual tension is helped by deliberately provocative casting. </p> <p>Rupert Graves as Patrick and Sienna Guillory as Jenny are both so attractive that viewers may be smashing through the screen to get at them. </p> <p>Like his son, Kingsley Amis often called on broad comic characters - Take A Girl Like You has a nerdy socialist, a French bird, a shy plodder - but makes them special through the crackle of the narrative description. For a novelist, television adaptation is a choice between laryngitis and strep throat. It's bound to hurt - the only question is exactly how much of your voice you lose. </p> <p>In this case, the production employs an unusual technical device to give the novelist a presence. Rather than the conventional voiceover of passages from the book, this series freezes the action during a scene, like football on TV, but, instead of Alan Hansen, the analysis comes from the character, as if speaking inner thoughts. </p> <p>Like most other aspects of the version, this works. The shifting of long-established television news bulletins would almost certainly have drawn from Amis, if still alive, Garrick Club harrumphing or letters to The Times. </p> <p>But his novel now makes him a posthumous warrior in the battle of the moved-news schedules. But, however Sir Kingsley's shade might hate the idea of being a beneficiary of change, this adaptation of Take A Girl Like You - redolent of the 50s, sexy because of the absence of sex - rewards the sharp attention brought to drama by the new programming. </p> <p>\u0095 Take A Girl Like You, Sunday, 9.05pm, BBC1</p>",

Rupert Graves as Patrick and Sienna Guillory as Jenny are both so attractive that viewers may be smashing through the screen to get at them. Like his son, Kingsley Amis often called on broad comic characters - Take A Girl Like You has a nerdy socialist, a French bird, a shy plodder - but makes them special through the crackle of the narrative description. For a novelist, television adaptation is a choice between laryngitis and strep throat. It's bound to hurt - the only question is exactly how much of your voice you lose. In this case, the production employs an unusual technical device to give the novelist a presence. Rather than the conventional voiceover of passages from the book, this series freezes the action during a scene, like football on TV, but, instead of Alan Hansen, the analysis comes from the character, as if speaking inner thoughts. Like most other aspects of the version, this works. The shifting of long-established television news bulletins would almost certainly have drawn from Amis, if still alive, Garrick Club harrumphing or letters to The Times. But his novel now makes him a posthumous warrior in the battle of the moved-news schedules. But, however Sir Kingsley's shade might hate the idea of being a beneficiary of change, this adaptation of Take A Girl Like You - redolent of the 50s, sexy because of the absence of sex - rewards the sharp attention brought to drama by the new programming. \u0095 Take A Girl Like You, Sunday, 9.05pm, BBC1",

A stroke of good fortune occurred when Julian Bream brought him a lute for repair, and was much impressed when he saw the one finished flamenco guitar David had made.</p> <p>This connection led to an invitation from Bream for David to set up a workshop at Bream's home in Semley, Wiltshire. David and Nest left New York in 1967. The space at Semley, however, was unsuitable. They had to look elsewhere and, in 1968, bought a derelict Tudor farmhouse in the Oxfordshire village of Duns Tew. David had already developed an interest in making copies of earlier string instruments, such as lutes, theorbos and baroque guitars, so it was a natural progression to move into harpsichord making as well.</p> <p>At that time, the early music scene was burgeoning, and there was much demand for good copies of historical instruments. In the 1970s top players, including Howard Schott, David Lumsden, Trevor Pinnock and Gustav Leonhardt, were among his customers. He was associated with making baroque violins as well as harpsichords, and latterly many modern violin-family instruments, including a number of complete \"quartets\". This was after a move to Cambridge in 1979, which also coincided with a period of intense research into the techniques of makers such as Stradivari, Amati and Guarneri, which he pursued in collaboration with scientists at Cambridge University.</p> <p>On one visit to his house and workshop, David showed me, with an almost boyish enthusiasm, electron microscope pictures of the structure of violin varnish, and explained to me his machine for checking the vibrations of a violin soundboard. This delight in all aspects of his work was typical, and also infectious: many of the earlier workers at Duns Tew went on to set up workshops of their own.</p> <p>A year ago, at David's request, I finished his last harpsichord, an instrument originally made in the late 1980s but never completed. At the time he was already very ill with cancer, and it was fitting that, in February, Cambridge University conferred on him an honorary master's degree.

Only federal matters can be heard there. So the Gore camp would have to switch to a whole new legal track, starting with a lower federal court. They would be unlikely to get much of a hearing: the federal bench is wary of meddling in state matters and, though it may seem puzzling to outsiders, elections are deemed a responsibility for the 50 states not the federal government.

A Bush presidency would be a joy to run against in 2002's mid-term elections: Democrats in opposition could well regain the control of the House and Senate they lost in 1994.

      "bodyText": "Farmland birds are under threat of extinction because of intensive farming, conservationists warn today. The skylark, grey partridge and corn bunting have fallen in numbers by more than 50% in 25 years and continue to fall at an alarming rate, according to the annual breeding bird survey compiled by the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The protectionists blame changes in farming methods over the same period - use of herbicides and shifts in crop growing routines being the most likely causes. The report says some farmland birds have been put on the conservationist UK Red list, higlighting species that have been reduced in numbers by at least 50% during the last 25 years. Information collated by volunteer birdwatchers on 217 species found that between 1994 and 1999 the the grey partridge population fell by 43%, the bullfinch by 28% and the corn bunting by 26%; the turtle dove population decreased by 18%, the skylark by 16%, and the linnet by 14%. Graham Madge, of the RSPB, said: \"Most of these birds were widespread 50 to 100 years ago, and we are now seeing the results of changes in the countryside. \"The time of year when crops are sown may seem insignificant, but it means that now many birds cannot find food in the winter.\" Research has shown that the introduction of autumn planting of wheat and barley had robbed farmland birds of the stubble fields that helped feed them during the winter. \"We will continue to see further decimation of the bird population unless we address the issue,\" Mr Madge warned. The government made a specific pledge in August to take action to stabilise the population of farmland bird, but this was widely described as an enormous task and one of the most ambitious conservation commitments any British government had given. The dramatic decline of farmland species, as well as a number of woodland species such as the wood warbler and willow tit, are described in the report as \"worrying\". Other birds causing concern include the shelduck, the redshank, the kestrel, the lapwing, the oystercatcher, and the great black-backed gull. The report does cite some exceptions to the gloomy trend, with 35 species increasing in numbers over 1995 to 1999. Mr Madge said: \"Most are small species that have benefited from a run of mild winters. Small birds find it very difficult to keep warm and find food during cold spells. The goldcrest in particular has gone up by 61% since 1994.\" The wren, the great-spotted woodpecker and the redstart are up 42%. Species that appear to be stable include the wood pigeon, the collared dove, the song thrush, the swallow, the wheatear, the pied wagtail, the whitethroat, the goldfinch and the greenfinch.

      "bodyText": "Women who look on the bright side of life will give birth to healthier babies, sleep well and remain slimmer, new research claimed today. In two separate studies, both published in the American Psychological Association's (APA) journal of Health Psychology, women aged between 20 and 46 from differing socio-economic backgrounds in America were examined by psychiatrists. The women were asked to describe their outlook on life and to place themselves on an imaginary social ladder with the 10th and highest rung implying a good job, strong education and secure finances while the first rung suggested insecurity and poverty. In the first survey, 129 high-risk pregnant women were interviewed and questioned about their attitude towards life. They were considered high-risk because they had either already had a miscarriage, suffered from diabetes or were having bleeding problems during their current pregnancies. Mantras such as \"I always look on the bright side, I always expect the best\" or \"I hardly ever expect things to go my way\" were put to these women. Those who responded most positively gave birth to stronger, heavier babies and the process of birth was less arduous. Psychologist Marci Lobel, who carried out the experiment, said: \"More optimistic women had better birth outcomes in part because they exercised more frequently, which improved a baby's greater gestational age at birth. \"These factors may be as important to maternal and foetal health as other factors like medical risk which have traditionally received greater attention.\" In the second survey, 160 healthy women aged between 30 and 46 were examined by Nancy Adler, professor of psychiatry at the University of California in San Francisco. When the women ranked themselves on the socio-economic ladder, those who had a good image of themselves were healthier as a whole. They had no trouble falling asleep at night, kept slimmer and generally felt more fit. The hormone cortisol which is associated with stress leads to abdominal weight gain and was evident in women who had placed themselves lower down on the scale.

But that also meant the idea of permanence and maturing into older middle-age, indulging the grandchildren, and participating in community networks, was changing too.

      "bodyText": "Britain's over-50s will increasingly be split into two nations, affluent early retirers in search of a better quality of life and low-paid men and women compelled to continue beyond pension age because of financial necessity, researchers said yesterday. Huge increases in the number of middle-aged people living alone after divorce or separation would mean growing demand for rented rooms while more men sliding towards alcoholism and depression would create a new burden for welfare services. The warning of a dark flipside to the \"grey panthers\" generation of well-off older consumers, who still see themselves as young, active and sociable, was made in a report for the economic and social research council. The generation divide over daily lifestyle between those over 50 and young people was disappearing, it suggested. But that also meant the idea of permanence and maturing into older middle-age, indulging the grandchildren, and participating in community networks, was changing too. The report suggested that for some over-50s \"more self-focused, hedonistic attitudes will emerge as they imitate the lifestyles of the young\". Already surveys suggested that they had similar alcohol consumption, TV, video and reading habits, and DIY and gardening interests, even if they listened to less music or engaged actively in sport. And the fireside and slippers image was further slipping as men and women went in search of self-fulfilment. More women, who were enjoying independence because of educational and employment opportunities, could choose to live alone. That meant the divorce rate, which has already tripled in 20 years from 3% to 9% among those in their 50s, could soar as increasing numbers in the age group re-examined their marriages and relationships in the light of their higher expectations. The majority would, however, suffer increasing financial hardship. More would have to care for their parents, and the problem would be made bigger by the fact that more of the parents would be older men living on their own. Today one in 10 men over 60 live alone, but by 2020 the figure could be one in three. \"This could lead to greater economic hardship for sons and daughters in their 50s as it forms an added burden for those who may still be contributing to the upbringing of their own children from present or past relationships.\" In addition, the longer life expectancy of parents meant their children now might have to wait until their 60s for inheritances that would help to pay off mortgages and fund their children's education. Richard Scase, of Kent University, and Jonathan Scales, of Essex University, authors of Fit and Fifty?, said all this was happening as those in managerial and professional occupations had an entrenched expectation of early retirement. But for many there would be economic and other burdens. \"Evidence suggests that women are more capable than men of managing their emotional and social lives, suggesting that the growth of single person households among those in their 50s is likely to lead to growing social and psychological problems for men.\"",

Two of her closest friends, Charlotte Holgate and Lisa Eastwood, who had been fellow students at Imperial College, London, also flew out to help and the family hired three Mexican private investigators. The company where Ms Searle worked, ab.fab Interactive Media Group, in Amsterdam, created a web page for information. Three Mexican police departments are liaising with Dutch police and Britain's Foreign Office to investigate the disappearance. Ms Searle grew up in Princes Risborough. Her father, Geoffrey, is English and her mother, Marjo, Dutch. The family moved to the Netherlands when she was 11 but she returned to study in Britain in the early 1990s.",

But for her to describe the new alliance as \"sounding distinctly spineless\" is premature and unkind - for the simple reason that it has not yet been launched.</p> <p>Toynbee writes that the alliance should be \"tough, political, savvy and negative\". And indeed, it will face an early test of its \"savvy\": how to explain why a movement for the end of child poverty is being launched after a government has so recently committed itself to ending child poverty.</p> <p>The government's pledge to end child poverty in 20 years is unambiguous. There is a danger of any new movement failing into a trap: if it fails to generate the same headlines as pensioners and fuel protestors, will the government use this as an excuse to quietly drop its commitment to ending child poverty? Or does that sound too negative?</p> <p>Children's organisations face a difficult challenge: how to become a sharper critic of government while responding positively to the government's wish to cement relationships between the voluntary, private and statutory sectors.</p> <p>Toynbee claims that the chancellor has created the children's alliance. This came as a bit of a surprise. The Child Poverty Action Group has a proud history of working with coalitions. However, despite the need for a new campaign, it values its independence. We will have to think long and hard before joining any movement for which ministers seem keen to take the credit. <br><b>Martin Barnes</b> <br>Director, Child Poverty Action Group</p> <p>\u0095 Polly Toynbee helpfully reminds us of a central thesis for this government, that child poverty is fundamental in reproducing social failure. Yet over at the Department for Education and Employment, David Blunkett and his fellow ministers spend a lot of time and energy denying any link between child poverty and educational attainment.</p> <p>It's high time the government decided as a whole what it really thinks about education and poverty, and stopped delegating this question to the opportunistic pretences of Blunkett and Tony Blair. <br><b>Nigel Blake</b> <br>Byfleet, Surrey</p> <p>\u0095 On Friday the BBC's Children in Need celebrated its 21st anniversary. Yet nowhere in the self-congratulatory hype was it mentioned that there are now three times more children living in poverty than in 1979. <br><b>Alan Mathison</b> <br>Harrow <br>alan.mathison@ntlworld.com</p>",

      "bodyText": "I agree with Polly Toynbee that an alliance for children is needed to keep child poverty at the top of the political agenda (Ladders to the good life, November 17). But for her to describe the new alliance as \"sounding distinctly spineless\" is premature and unkind - for the simple reason that it has not yet been launched. Toynbee writes that the alliance should be \"tough, political, savvy and negative\". And indeed, it will face an early test of its \"savvy\": how to explain why a movement for the end of child poverty is being launched after a government has so recently committed itself to ending child poverty. The government's pledge to end child poverty in 20 years is unambiguous. There is a danger of any new movement failing into a trap: if it fails to generate the same headlines as pensioners and fuel protestors, will the government use this as an excuse to quietly drop its commitment to ending child poverty? Or does that sound too negative? Children's organisations face a difficult challenge: how to become a sharper critic of government while responding positively to the government's wish to cement relationships between the voluntary, private and statutory sectors. Toynbee claims that the chancellor has created the children's alliance. This came as a bit of a surprise. The Child Poverty Action Group has a proud history of working with coalitions. However, despite the need for a new campaign, it values its independence. We will have to think long and hard before joining any movement for which ministers seem keen to take the credit. Martin Barnes Director, Child Poverty Action Group \u0095 Polly Toynbee helpfully reminds us of a central thesis for this government, that child poverty is fundamental in reproducing social failure. Yet over at the Department for Education and Employment, David Blunkett and his fellow ministers spend a lot of time and energy denying any link between child poverty and educational attainment. It's high time the government decided as a whole what it really thinks about education and poverty, and stopped delegating this question to the opportunistic pretences of Blunkett and Tony Blair. Nigel Blake Byfleet, Surrey \u0095 On Friday the BBC's Children in Need celebrated its 21st anniversary. Yet nowhere in the self-congratulatory hype was it mentioned that there are now three times more children living in poverty than in 1979. Alan Mathison Harrow alan.mathison@ntlworld.com",

With Christmas just five weeks away and the government voicing concern over ads promoting expensive toys, leading European psychologists and researchers will report from a range of studies on the subject.

Dr Bjurstrom's work played a key role in persuading the Swedish government to ban all TV advertising to children under 12. He will be joined by Dr Brian Young of the University of Exeter, a leading authority on children and advertising, and Ingrid Kjordstad of the National Institute for Consumer Research in Norway, an expert on children and internet advertising. The issue of advertising for children is increasingly making headlines. Last week, the Chartered Institute of Marketing released research that suggested advertising may have more power over children than their own parents. The IPA may have its work cut out to prevent a ban in the light of findings that showed 36% of adult consumers in the UK believe that advertising is the biggest influence on children's lives. The debate was also fuelled by chancellor Gordon Brown's comments yesterday about the damaging effects of TV adverts on poor families who can't afford expensive brand name toys. Negative PR surrounding children's drink brands like Sunny Delight also do little to help the IPA's cause. While Sunny Delight has been marketed as a healthy alternative to fizzy drinks, it has a high sugar content and contains only 5% juice.",

      "body": "<p>For latter day new agers, the believers in the digital economy, oil is such an old fashioned commodity that it barely rates a mention. In their visions of the future, the economy will run on ideas and computer codes, and somehow escape one of the iron laws of economics: scarcity. </p> <p> But if the laws of supply and demand have apparently been suspended in the digital world, they are back with a vengeance in the world of energy, as Opec has demonstrated this year. The production cuts that the oil producers' cartel implemented last year have trebled the price of crude, and some economists believe the soaring price of energy will inevitably send the industrialised world into recession. </p> <p> \"The modern world turns on energy; and the biggest provider of that is petroleum,\" says Professor Andrew Oswald, from the University of Warwick. \"I am sceptical when people tell me that Bill Gates and computers have taken over so we don't need to worry about oil stocks any more.\" </p> <p> Rather than being the bad guys, though, it is possible that Opec has done the west a good turn this year by putting up the costs of its favourite fuel, even if the price is a painful slump. </p> <p> We simply cannot afford to consume as much of the stuff as we have been doing. Burning oil is choking the world with carbon dioxide, an important cause of global warning. Second, even without the hand of Opec interfering, oil prices could be about to rise steeply because of dwindling supplies. </p> <p> The nightmare scenario is outlined by David Fleming in a recent article - After Oil Prospect, November 2000. \"The steep decline in the discovery of oil since 1965 means that production, too, must decline, and the turning point is expected in 2005,\" he writes. </p> <p> Such gloomy prognoses have been dismissed in the past by analysts, who argue that there are further reserves out there waiting to be discovered. </p> <p> But Mr Fleming says that many of these new fields are of lower quality than great oil fields which have fuelled world industry since the war and will be more expensive and slower to extract. The turning point will come when demand outstrips supply, sending prices through the roof. </p> <p> Higher prices will prompt new exploration and make some marginal fields viable. This will only delay the inevitable, according to Mr Fleming. \"Within the period 2001-3, the tension between demand and the reduced growth in supply can only be expected to raise the price of oil supplies even further,\" he says. </p> <p> Even the relatively conservative International Energy Agency agrees that world oil supply will peak, although it predicts a deadline of 2012. </p> <p> But its analysis is based on assuming demand grows in line with past trends. An even scarier possibility is raised by Prof Oswald. At present the US, with its 250m consumers, sucks up the largest proportion of world oil - 19m of the 74m barrels the world uses daily.

      "bodyText": "For latter day new agers, the believers in the digital economy, oil is such an old fashioned commodity that it barely rates a mention. In their visions of the future, the economy will run on ideas and computer codes, and somehow escape one of the iron laws of economics: scarcity. But if the laws of supply and demand have apparently been suspended in the digital world, they are back with a vengeance in the world of energy, as Opec has demonstrated this year. The production cuts that the oil producers' cartel implemented last year have trebled the price of crude, and some economists believe the soaring price of energy will inevitably send the industrialised world into recession. \"The modern world turns on energy; and the biggest provider of that is petroleum,\" says Professor Andrew Oswald, from the University of Warwick. \"I am sceptical when people tell me that Bill Gates and computers have taken over so we don't need to worry about oil stocks any more.\" Rather than being the bad guys, though, it is possible that Opec has done the west a good turn this year by putting up the costs of its favourite fuel, even if the price is a painful slump. We simply cannot afford to consume as much of the stuff as we have been doing. Burning oil is choking the world with carbon dioxide, an important cause of global warning. Second, even without the hand of Opec interfering, oil prices could be about to rise steeply because of dwindling supplies. The nightmare scenario is outlined by David Fleming in a recent article - After Oil Prospect, November 2000. \"The steep decline in the discovery of oil since 1965 means that production, too, must decline, and the turning point is expected in 2005,\" he writes. Such gloomy prognoses have been dismissed in the past by analysts, who argue that there are further reserves out there waiting to be discovered. But Mr Fleming says that many of these new fields are of lower quality than great oil fields which have fuelled world industry since the war and will be more expensive and slower to extract. The turning point will come when demand outstrips supply, sending prices through the roof. Higher prices will prompt new exploration and make some marginal fields viable. This will only delay the inevitable, according to Mr Fleming. \"Within the period 2001-3, the tension between demand and the reduced growth in supply can only be expected to raise the price of oil supplies even further,\" he says. Even the relatively conservative International Energy Agency agrees that world oil supply will peak, although it predicts a deadline of 2012. But its analysis is based on assuming demand grows in line with past trends. An even scarier possibility is raised by Prof Oswald. At present the US, with its 250m consumers, sucks up the largest proportion of world oil - 19m of the 74m barrels the world uses daily. Two-thirds is used for transportation. \"Forget software taking over from steel mills,\" says Mr Oswald. \"It is the rise and rise of the motor car and the lorry which is the issue.\" At the moment, the average American consumes 25 times the amount of oil used by the average Chinese citizen. China consumes just 4m barrels of oil a day for transport, despite having five times as many people as the US. But what happens when the growing Chinese middle classes trade in their bicycles for cars? China is about to open its markets and join the World Trade Organisation, a process which involve painful disruptions for many of its citizens, but growing wealth for many others - and the arrival of foreign car firms will provide the opportunity to spend their money. The country is industrialising rapidly, and while there are only 15m cars in the country now - one for every 125 people - the numbers are rising rapidly. Prof Oswald says that once China gets the motor car all bets are off. \"It's not clear how world oil demand and supply will cope in our children's lives,\" he says. It is a problem, too, for the politicians gathering at The Hague this week to thrash out an agreement on cuts to carbon dioxide emissions to tackle global warming. Developing countries such as China were excluded from the agreement outlined three years ago in Kyoto, when industrialised countries agreed to cut emissions back to an average of 5% below 1990 levels over the next decade. The US is calling on developing nations to shoulder some of the burden of cutting emissions - provoking outrage from their politicians, who point out that it was the west that put most of the carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The US position is particularly galling because it has not even managed to sell the relatively modest cuts outlined at Kyoto to an American electorate hooked on oil. The US economy has been firing on all cylinders during the past few years, increasing its demand for energy, and it would now have to cut back its emissions by 20% - a target US industry says is impossibly painful.

      "body": "<p>English National Opera's Italian Season dispatches the 20th century in a single evening. The entire tradition since Puccini is defined by a trio of one-act works, two of them never meant to be staged at all. One of the results is that Berio, arguably the most important Italian opera composer since Puccini, is represented not by one of his six full-scale theatre works (five of which have yet to be seen fully staged in this country), but by a twee and wholly unnecessary dramatic packaging of his Folksongs, one of the most widely performed of all his concert works. </p> <p>The musical perfection of Berio's settings, with their endlessly inventive instrumental accompaniments to a joyously polyglot collection of texts and melodies, is swamped here by Neil Armfield's insufferably cutesy production; the singer Susan Parry appears onstage with a trio of children in tow, to whom she addresses the songs - and the raw directness of Berio's settings, which were written for his first wife Cathy Berberian, is totally lost in the process. The whole thing is too genteel, too comfortable. Sadly it sets the tone for the whole programme. </p> <p>Furthermore, the choice of Nina Rota's film music for Fellini's La Strada to form the centrepiece of the programme is plain mystifying.

      "bodyText": "English National Opera's Italian Season dispatches the 20th century in a single evening. The entire tradition since Puccini is defined by a trio of one-act works, two of them never meant to be staged at all. One of the results is that Berio, arguably the most important Italian opera composer since Puccini, is represented not by one of his six full-scale theatre works (five of which have yet to be seen fully staged in this country), but by a twee and wholly unnecessary dramatic packaging of his Folksongs, one of the most widely performed of all his concert works. The musical perfection of Berio's settings, with their endlessly inventive instrumental accompaniments to a joyously polyglot collection of texts and melodies, is swamped here by Neil Armfield's insufferably cutesy production; the singer Susan Parry appears onstage with a trio of children in tow, to whom she addresses the songs - and the raw directness of Berio's settings, which were written for his first wife Cathy Berberian, is totally lost in the process. The whole thing is too genteel, too comfortable. Sadly it sets the tone for the whole programme. Furthermore, the choice of Nina Rota's film music for Fellini's La Strada to form the centrepiece of the programme is plain mystifying. Armfield turns this episodic and trivial score into wordless children's street theatre, which is part Lord of the Flies, part Billy Elliott. Though ENO doubtless gains lots of Brownie points by being able to involve its outreach organisation, The Baylis Programme, in the show, the result is never remotely interesting or even diverting, just the waste of a precious slot in this otherwise so enterprising and intelligent series.

      "body": "<p>Poppy Max spent his first night in America sleeping under Brooklyn Bridge. And the next night, and then the next two weeks as well, until he finally got started in the rag trade, peddling clothes out of a hand-cart. </p> <p>Today, when his great-granddaughter Nancy Lublin zips up her suitcase for the flight to London, she follows Poppy Max's own path. He never forgot the other guys under the bridge - when he'd got on his feet, there would always be clothes for the others who still had nothing. </p> <p>So, when Poppy Max died in 1996 and left Lublin $5,000 (\u00a33,500), she decided to found a non-profit, self-help organisation for women wanting to make a new start. How can you pull yourself up by your bootstraps if you don't have boots, she argued - if a woman doesn't have a job, she can't afford clothes; but without the right clothes, she won't get the job. </p> <p>Four years later, Dress for Success has suited 40,000 women for their new starts across 60 American cities, Canada, and New Zealand. Her most recent project in London has already clothed 300 clients for interviews. </p> <p>And as she arrives in the UK today to discuss how British office workers can contribute through her workplace \"suit drives\", Lublin is politely curious about recent publicity for the new Ready2Work initiative. Reed in Partnership has started a similar scheme to that practised by Dress for Success, but grabbed the headlines by inviting celebrities to donate unwanted clothes for use by job-hunting women. </p> <p>Liz Hurley, Cherie Blair, Geri Halliwell, Ali MacGraw and Glenys Kinnock were among the first donors, and the reaction was diverse. On the one hand, there was approval for the celebs, whose generosity was followed in sprightly fashion by chain stores making donations in bulk. In contrast, there was a certain cattiness over whether a Liz Hurley outfit would give the right or wrong impression at an interview - and questions about what the jobhunter would wear on Day 2 if she got the job. There was even some quite uncharitable discussion of the celebrities' own taste in what they wore and gave. </p> <p>\"Yeah, an English ex-boyfriend just phoned to tell me that he read about this in the papers there,\" says Lublin. \"I guess somebody copying our idea is a high form of flattery. On the other hand, I'd be pretty disgusted if the original idea just turned into big headlines about fancy suits from flashy women. </p> <p>\"This isn't about 'ladies who lunch' sprinkling love and charity on the poor. The Dress for Success thing is about working women helping other working women - how a woman with a job and kids will take time to pull three suits from her closet just so that three other women can feel confident and make a great first impression at a job interview. </p> <p>\"I have never solicited celebrity suits,\" she adds. \"We get them, but they go right on the rack next to the others, because our focus isn't on who the suits came from - it is on who they are going to.\" </p> <p>While the American operation is strictly non-profit, Reed in Partner ship sprang from the holding company's employment division, set up in 1998 to bid for the government's welfare-to-work schemes that were put out to the private sector. It now runs four New Deal schemes and four Employment Zones, in London, Liverpool and Darlington. </p> <p>Before the celebrity donations idea was born, Reed originally put its own money into buying clothes to help jobseekers. Now there is a target of 200 star-given outfits, with bulk donations from House of Fraser, Whistles and Etam, plus support and storage provided by Susannah Constantine and Trinny Woodall at their Ready2Shop business. It's estimated that 200 job-seeking women will be helped this year alone. </p> <p>By contrast, the American operation remains relatively homespun in approach. \"When I first got the idea, I reached out to three nuns in Spanish Harlem to help me start it - which was a little weird for a Jewish kid - but I knew that these women had great experience in the community,\" Lublin explains. \"They would refer clients to us, and we still operate this way: only there are now 143 member agencies here in New York sending clients. </p> <p>\"We don't ever scrutinize the clients - instead, we carefully select member agencies who send them to us. Our sister programmes who dress the clients are run by passionate and smart people who have dedicated long hours to work for women in their community. Some have even quit jobs to do it.\" </p> <p>Dress for Success equips its clients with one suit of clothes for the interview, perhaps with a smart handbag, or an overcoat in winter, and then gives successful job-winners a second outfit to see them through their first week in work. But what is the ideal interview suit? </p> <p>Ready2Work has stoically put up with taunts about its clients turning up for interviews in stars' party frocks. In fact, those running the scheme explained quite clearly to the celebrities that jobseekers were going for a range of jobs, and would require practical suits or smart separates. The celebs who donated were asked to include a personal message of support for the career hopefuls - and a note of thanks from the jobseeker can be passed back to the celebrity. </p> <p>Lublin sympathises with the cheap laughs that the star strategy drew, but has no such problems with unsuitable clothes. \"To me, an interview suit is just like soccer kit - you can't compete unless you are dressed the appropriate way. We're trying to give women suits so appropriate that their clothing doesn't matter. That means when you are dressed appropriately, then the interviewer will pay attention to your skills and your character, not to what you're wearing. I think the perfect interview outfit is something that the interviewer themselves would wear.\" </p> <p>Instead of approaching the stars, Lublin and her British team are about to target working women here, particularly those in large companies, with the introduction of two of her favourite American promotions: \"Clear your Closet Week\" and \"suit drives\". </p> <p>\"Oh, we love suit drives,\" she says. \"We encourage offices to set up collection sites for women to bring in clean, contemporary, almost-new suits. It's a great way for busy working women to contribute to the community. Goldman Sachs hosted one in London a couple of weeks ago.\" </p> <p>That, says Lublin, was an object lesson in corporate goodwill. Goldman Sachs took over the entire organisation of the project, and cleverly ran it across three days - because people always forget to bring things in \"on the day\". The result was 200 suits offered by working women to their direct out-of-work contemporaries. </p> <p>It was also, says Lublin, a demonstration of the co-operative principle. \"These suits aren't handouts - each suit is one woman's token of faith in another woman's ability to succeed.\"</p>",

Now there is a target of 200 star-given outfits, with bulk donations from House of Fraser, Whistles and Etam, plus support and storage provided by Susannah Constantine and Trinny Woodall at their Ready2Shop business. It's estimated that 200 job-seeking women will be helped this year alone. By contrast, the American operation remains relatively homespun in approach. \"When I first got the idea, I reached out to three nuns in Spanish Harlem to help me start it - which was a little weird for a Jewish kid - but I knew that these women had great experience in the community,\" Lublin explains. \"They would refer clients to us, and we still operate this way: only there are now 143 member agencies here in New York sending clients. \"We don't ever scrutinize the clients - instead, we carefully select member agencies who send them to us. Our sister programmes who dress the clients are run by passionate and smart people who have dedicated long hours to work for women in their community. Some have even quit jobs to do it.\" Dress for Success equips its clients with one suit of clothes for the interview, perhaps with a smart handbag, or an overcoat in winter, and then gives successful job-winners a second outfit to see them through their first week in work. But what is the ideal interview suit? Ready2Work has stoically put up with taunts about its clients turning up for interviews in stars' party frocks. In fact, those running the scheme explained quite clearly to the celebrities that jobseekers were going for a range of jobs, and would require practical suits or smart separates. The celebs who donated were asked to include a personal message of support for the career hopefuls - and a note of thanks from the jobseeker can be passed back to the celebrity. Lublin sympathises with the cheap laughs that the star strategy drew, but has no such problems with unsuitable clothes. \"To me, an interview suit is just like soccer kit - you can't compete unless you are dressed the appropriate way. We're trying to give women suits so appropriate that their clothing doesn't matter. That means when you are dressed appropriately, then the interviewer will pay attention to your skills and your character, not to what you're wearing. I think the perfect interview outfit is something that the interviewer themselves would wear.\" Instead of approaching the stars, Lublin and her British team are about to target working women here, particularly those in large companies, with the introduction of two of her favourite American promotions: \"Clear your Closet Week\" and \"suit drives\". \"Oh, we love suit drives,\" she says. \"We encourage offices to set up collection sites for women to bring in clean, contemporary, almost-new suits. It's a great way for busy working women to contribute to the community. Goldman Sachs hosted one in London a couple of weeks ago.\" That, says Lublin, was an object lesson in corporate goodwill. Goldman Sachs took over the entire organisation of the project, and cleverly ran it across three days - because people always forget to bring things in \"on the day\". The result was 200 suits offered by working women to their direct out-of-work contemporaries. It was also, says Lublin, a demonstration of the co-operative principle. \"These suits aren't handouts - each suit is one woman's token of faith in another woman's ability to succeed.\"",

Just when we were in danger of turning into a nation of politically-correct, moralising, brown-nosing teachers' pets, up comes a new survey to prove we are all every bit as devious, two-faced, unprincipled and downright underhand at work as I'd expected.</p> <p>Blabbing is the name of the game. Remember those tasty personal secrets you've been confiding to trusted work colleagues on a reasonably regular basis, safe in the knowledge that all the lurid details of your health and sex life will go no further than the one or two pair of ears you whispered into?</p> <p>Well forget it. According to new statistics from Office Angels you would have done better in terms of security if you'd plastered your intimate details on the world-wide web. For not only do 77% of office workers find it impossible to keep a secret, evidently, but they'll have told at least two other people within the same working day.</p> <p>Big communal sigh of relief, then. It's not just me who can't keep her mouth buttoned. It's not that we mean to be disloyal, is it? It's just that personal secrets and work gossip are only worth listening to if you can then spread them around.</p> <p>And you needn't get all whey-faced with moral indignation if you're the one being betrayed. You would never have told in the first place if the secret was that sacred. The minute you uttered the words: \"Don't tell anyone else, but...\" you must have known that half the room were already alerting the neon light man at Piccadilly Circus to be on the ready for breaking news.</p> <p>If you really want to confide in private then see a priest or a psychiatrist Or phone a friend outside your workplace who will only broadcast it about her own office, rather than yours. Because gossip is what makes the world of work go around. It is the only form of business communication that actually works, and works wonderfully well, to boot. I do try to be discreet, honestly. We all do, don't we? But then we meet up with this huge predicament.

      "bodyText": "Isn't it just lovely to discover you're not the only one with a hideous personality flaw? Just when we were in danger of turning into a nation of politically-correct, moralising, brown-nosing teachers' pets, up comes a new survey to prove we are all every bit as devious, two-faced, unprincipled and downright underhand at work as I'd expected. Blabbing is the name of the game. Remember those tasty personal secrets you've been confiding to trusted work colleagues on a reasonably regular basis, safe in the knowledge that all the lurid details of your health and sex life will go no further than the one or two pair of ears you whispered into? Well forget it. According to new statistics from Office Angels you would have done better in terms of security if you'd plastered your intimate details on the world-wide web. For not only do 77% of office workers find it impossible to keep a secret, evidently, but they'll have told at least two other people within the same working day. Big communal sigh of relief, then. It's not just me who can't keep her mouth buttoned. It's not that we mean to be disloyal, is it? It's just that personal secrets and work gossip are only worth listening to if you can then spread them around. And you needn't get all whey-faced with moral indignation if you're the one being betrayed. You would never have told in the first place if the secret was that sacred. The minute you uttered the words: \"Don't tell anyone else, but...\" you must have known that half the room were already alerting the neon light man at Piccadilly Circus to be on the ready for breaking news. If you really want to confide in private then see a priest or a psychiatrist Or phone a friend outside your workplace who will only broadcast it about her own office, rather than yours. Because gossip is what makes the world of work go around. It is the only form of business communication that actually works, and works wonderfully well, to boot. I do try to be discreet, honestly. We all do, don't we? But then we meet up with this huge predicament. One of our colleagues is taking us to one side and implying there is some great secret in his/her life that we would give a right arm and two kidneys to hear. All we have to do to be privy to this astounding, mind-boggling, life-changing piece of gossip is to swear it will go no further.

They have already played the secret up to a point where the drool of anticipation is running down your chest. So what would you do? I tell all for two reasons: either the so-called secret is so dull that I forget I had sworn on my first-born's life not to blab (Always a good wheeze, as I have no kids), or it is of such national interest that keeping it to myself would be borderline illegal. According to the survey, other reasons for leaking all include: \u0095 Craving the attention associated with revealing information \u0095 Using the knowledge as a means to demonstrate power \u0095 Breaking the confidence with the aim of helping the situation Or: \u0095 Revealing it by accident Of course the disgusting downside of all this harmful fun comes when the excrement hits the fan and the blabbermouth is unmasked.

There's no substitute for experience and that's a pain for most people, but it's true.\" </p> <p>Yahoo itself is a very young company; in just four years it has become a household name. The brainchild of two American students, David Filo and Jerry Yang, it began from their college campus and garden shed as a directory for sumo wrestlers. Yahoo has since grown internationally to become one of the most popular search engines on the world wide web. </p> <p>Harding says she is definitely not a technophile, but enjoys and appreciates the uses of computers. \"I'm not a boffin - I wouldn't know what to do with a computer program if it bit me in the arse.\" Her duties include the regular secretarial tasks, but one of her major concerns is to ensure that her boss never gets snowed under. \"I look after her schedule and make sure she gets where she needs to be. I don't always get a chance to sit with her everyday. I keep an eye on her schedule and make sure she has enough DND [do not disturb] sessions so that she can get her head down and do the work that she needs to.

She's always on the radio: a lot of people want to get her opinion on things,\" she says. But keeping up with a dynamic boss rarely fazes Harding. Over the years she has had a colourful employment history. She landed her first job in Frankfurt, Germany, working as a PA in the American army when she ran out of money while travelling after graduating from St Martin's School of Art. </p> <p>What happened to the art? \"Reality slapped me very hard at a very early age, and I quickly learnt that reality meant I had to earn a living,\" she says. \"I know I'm supposed to say how great it is being a secretary, but it wasn't the plan. I learnt to type so that I would have something to fall back on.\" </p> <p>But there have been good times: she seems to have enjoyed her time as PA at the Zoological Society of London, where she organised events, conferences and exhibitions. Much of her time was spent dealing with VIPs, including the likes of Lady Thatcher and Ken Livingstone. Her greatest achievement was arranging the visit of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Japan. You can almost hear the drum roll. </p> <p>\"It was just such a huge operation. The Japanese don't think of him as a god anymore but his status is still huge. For security purposes you won't get one or two people checking things out, you'll get four or five - and then you'll get another 10 after them, just to make sure. It was my biggest challenge because the Japanese culture is such a precise culture and we had to get all the formalities right.\" </p> <p>Moving from London Zoo, where other experiences ranged from having a boa constrictor wrapped around her neck to a room full of bats defecating on her head, into an office took some adjusting to. \"Yahoo is the fastest paced office I've ever worked in.

But we have got quieter sections: the producers who design the pages usually work with headphones on so that they can concentrate. Then we've got the engineers who are really focused - they're about the most techie people you can get, and down there you can hear a pin drop,\" she says. </p> <p>Being the eldest in the team, staff consider her a comforting figure. \"A lot of them call me matron!

WPM is not entirely sure, however, that her \"a funny thing happened on the way to the party\" tales wouldn't descend into wails of commuting misery. </p> <p>Your companion's body language is, as the Aziz Corporation wisely points out, an excellent indicator of how scintillating your conversation is proving. If he or she starts looking over your shoulder to scout the room for more interesting - or coherent - colleagues, you know you're in trouble. No word, though, on whether staring intently at your cleavage (well, it is Christmas) is good or bad. </p> <p>One piece of advice that WPM will certainly be taking to heart, or maybe inking onto her free arm, is the \"40-second soundbite\" on who she is and what the hell she's doing at this party. Handy for blather-free introductions, sure, but handier still for those late-in-the-evening moments when all memories of your own name have deserted you. Oh, hang on - top tip number 10: don't drink too much. Ah. </p> <p>*Glad to hear that Marks &amp; Spencer's chairman and directors have decided to take to the shop floors during the run-up to Christmas. Pitching in with the packing, stacking and wrapping is fairly standard for the big cheeses at many retailers, including Tesco, but this is the first time that M&amp;S bosses will have joined workers at the tills. \"The staff in the stores will tell us what they want us to do,\" explained marketing director Alan McWalter. Now, now staff - be kind. WPM does wonder, though, whether the bosses will return with such goodwill in the New Year to welcome back all those Christmas shoppers armed with receipts and unwanted presents . . . </p> <p>*Way back in August, Office Hours lamented the depressing state of Britain's workplaces. A potplant here and there is all very well, we moaned, but what about some real change. The Canon Campaign for Better Offices was thinking along the same lines and last week unveiled the winner of its competition to revamp a tired workspace. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy in Edinburgh will receive a facelift over the coming weeks and WPM can only assume - without wishing to sound too disparaging about the exising decor - that it thoroughly deserved it. And not a Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen in sight. </p> <p>*An apology. Last week, this column encouraged readers to contact the House of Commons employment select committee with their views on age discrimination in the workplace. Unfortunately, WPM then made it as difficult as possible for you to do so, by printing the wrong email address to contact. Sorry about that. For those of you who are still keen - and you've got until January to concoct your submission - the correct address is mulleyj@parliament.uk. Honestly. You can check out what the investigation aims to cover by looking at <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/\">www.parliament.uk/</a> commons/selcom/edepnt45.htm </p> <p>*And while you're at it, you could take a quick peek at <a href=\"http://www.workplaceviolence.co.uk,\">www.workplaceviolence.co.uk,</a> a new site from conflict management specialists Maybo, the CBI and other interested bodies. It aims to provide a platform for employers and their staff to share advice and experiences, and in turn the site offers research and ideas on how to deal with this increasingly prevalent problem (local government workers and front-line reception staff are often targets). The site's in its early stages, so be patient and expect more information to appear over the next few weeks or so.</p>",

Your companion's body language is, as the Aziz Corporation wisely points out, an excellent indicator of how scintillating your conversation is proving. If he or she starts looking over your shoulder to scout the room for more interesting - or coherent - colleagues, you know you're in trouble. No word, though, on whether staring intently at your cleavage (well, it is Christmas) is good or bad. One piece of advice that WPM will certainly be taking to heart, or maybe inking onto her free arm, is the \"40-second soundbite\" on who she is and what the hell she's doing at this party. Handy for blather-free introductions, sure, but handier still for those late-in-the-evening moments when all memories of your own name have deserted you. Oh, hang on - top tip number 10: don't drink too much. Ah. *Glad to hear that Marks &amp; Spencer's chairman and directors have decided to take to the shop floors during the run-up to Christmas. Pitching in with the packing, stacking and wrapping is fairly standard for the big cheeses at many retailers, including Tesco, but this is the first time that M&amp;S bosses will have joined workers at the tills. \"The staff in the stores will tell us what they want us to do,\" explained marketing director Alan McWalter. Now, now staff - be kind. WPM does wonder, though, whether the bosses will return with such goodwill in the New Year to welcome back all those Christmas shoppers armed with receipts and unwanted presents . . . *Way back in August, Office Hours lamented the depressing state of Britain's workplaces. A potplant here and there is all very well, we moaned, but what about some real change. The Canon Campaign for Better Offices was thinking along the same lines and last week unveiled the winner of its competition to revamp a tired workspace. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy in Edinburgh will receive a facelift over the coming weeks and WPM can only assume - without wishing to sound too disparaging about the exising decor - that it thoroughly deserved it. And not a Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen in sight. *An apology. Last week, this column encouraged readers to contact the House of Commons employment select committee with their views on age discrimination in the workplace. Unfortunately, WPM then made it as difficult as possible for you to do so, by printing the wrong email address to contact. Sorry about that. For those of you who are still keen - and you've got until January to concoct your submission - the correct address is mulleyj@parliament.uk. Honestly. You can check out what the investigation aims to cover by looking at www.parliament.uk/ commons/selcom/edepnt45.htm *And while you're at it, you could take a quick peek at www.workplaceviolence.co.uk, a new site from conflict management specialists Maybo, the CBI and other interested bodies. It aims to provide a platform for employers and their staff to share advice and experiences, and in turn the site offers research and ideas on how to deal with this increasingly prevalent problem (local government workers and front-line reception staff are often targets). The site's in its early stages, so be patient and expect more information to appear over the next few weeks or so.",

As a result, managers can, and do, contact their support staff at home, in the theatre or restaurant, in bed, or even abroad on holiday. This blurs the distinction between professional and private in both the PA's and the boss's job.\" </p> <p>Even temps now tend to have mobile phones on which their bosses can reach them, says Gill Stewart, director of recruitment consultancy Tate Appointments. </p> <p>But you're still most likely to be asked to do things outside your remit if you have a male boss, confirms Sarah El Doori of recruitment agency Office Angels. \"I can remember one incident of a PA being sent out by her male boss to buy toupee tapes - sticky pads that hold a hairpiece in place,\" she laughs. Age is also relevant, she says. \"It's my experience that the older the boss and the older the PA, the more likely it is that your role will extend into the personal.\" </p> <p>Jo Ashby, a 47-year-old secretary for a health insurance company in Berkshire, agrees. \"My boss, who's 59, thinks nothing of telling me to lie to his wife when he's out to lunch with his mistress.
