Equitable policyholders - some of whom have as many as 10 votes - have been told to vote against Mr Doogan. </p> <p>And even the complicated electoral system appears stacked against him.

Supporters of mutuality say carpetbaggers are pursuing selfish short-term gain instead of long-term benefit. Further, they say, the assets of mutual societies have been built up over generations and that this generation is not entitled to the profits. In effect, demutualising is selling off the family silver and expecting the next generation to eat off paper plates. </p> <p>Of course carpetbaggers see it differently, especially those salivating over the biggest payouts - some pension policies and long-term endowments may pay out in excess of \u00a310,000 - but policyholders and savers in other investments such as unit linked funds, unit trusts and protection policies will probably get nothing. </p> <p>No one can see into the future, the pro-proprietary camps say. So while the mutual societies may be right about mutuality being in the long-term interest of policyholders, they are happy to take their chances - and the money - and run. </p> <p>The issue will not go away. So Jobs &amp; Money asked Standard Life and Friends Provident about the pros and the cons. </p> <p><strong>Standard Life</strong> </p> <p>Standard Life, Europe's largest mutual life insurer with \u00a379bn worth of assets under management, has made no secret of its desire to remain mutual. The Edinburgh firm is having the issue forced upon it, with windfall-seeking carpetbaggers, led by Australian Fred Woollard who could scoop \u00a3150,000 or more, tabling resolutions on the issue. It is firmly committed to being run purely for customers, who are understood to include one in six UK adults, although only a minority will qualify for a payout if the anti-mutual line prevails. Its pro-mutuality arguments include: </p> <p>Better rates and better service - because they don't give profits to shareholders. </p> <p>Proprietary companies normally pay 10% of profits to shareholders so the with-profits policyholders get less each year. Over a 25-year plan the gap can be huge, as each extra slice from mutual ownership is compounded each year. </p> <p>Conversion may lead to short-term gain through windfall payouts but in the long-run consumers will suffer from higher rates, higher charges and lower quality service. </p> <p>Pro-mutuality campaigners point to Consumers Association research which shows mortgage customers of converted building societies soon lose out even after taking their windfall into account. </p> <p>Submission to City presssure - quoted companies have to please investors rather than customers. </p> <p>Industry competition: by offering competitive rates they stop banks and other financial services providers raising the margins. </p> <p>Social inclusion - it is helpful for the country to have insitiutions that will offer members accounts. </p> <p><strong>Friends Provident</strong> </p> <p>It won't go beyond saying \"a listing would provide a more flexible corporate structure to achieve strategic goals in today's competitive marketplace and for members to gain the benefits of share ownership while continuing to enjoy the benefits of their policyholding\". But based on previous life insurers demutualising, these are the reasons likely to be going through the directors' minds. </p> <p>Raising capital - to strengthen existing opera tions or to expand - stockmarket companies can ask for capital from investors but mutuals rely on internal resources </p> <p>Expansion - through acquisitions they can buy other companies with shares. </p> <p>Growth - non-mutuals find it easier to fund new ventures because they can raise permanent capital on the stock market. Mutuals can borrow but they must pay interest and eventually hand back the capital </p> <p>Risk taking - plcs can take more risks because in the event of a substantial loss it can ask its shareholders for more money. Mutuals have to be more careful as their funds back policyholders' savings and pensions. </p> <p>Strengthening management - with analyst, shareholder and press attention focused on public companies, they believe they are better managed than mutuals. </p> <p>Equality of customers - in a proprietary company, the gap between members who are holders of with-profits funds and other investors and policyholders disappears. Mutuality only offers benefit for some.</p> <p><strong>Doing the right thing</strong></p> <p>If you're confused about the pros and cons of demutalisation and looking for someone to give you quick and easy advice on the issue, independent financial adviser Roddy Kohn won't make things any easier. He thinks demutualisation is right for some, but not for others, and only a proper analysis of a company's workings will establish if it is right for them. \"If a company has not got the individual resources to stay in business or develop its business as a mutual, then it is in the best interests of its policyholders that it goes public.\" This, he says, was the case with Norwich Union which demutualised in 1996, writes Jessica McCallin.</p> <p>Mr Kohn kept his life endownment policy with Norwich Union through the demutualisation until the present day. And so far says he is happy with the way it is performing: \"Publicly listed companies are always under pressure from shareholders. I don't mind this and don't mind the fact that they may not be paying me the maximum possible rate because of it, so long as at the end of my endowment policy's term it meets with my satisfaction.\" But this is where the problem starts. So far, Norwich Union might be doing fine, but the issue with these newly-demutualised companies and the policies they sell is with their long-term performance. Mr Kohn concedes that it is still too early to say if Norwich Union will continue to meet the mark, but if it were to do badly, any benefits he gained from his windfall shares would be lost. </p> <p>In Standard Life's case Mr Kohn is adamant that it should remain mutual. \"The company has produced consistently outstanding results. It has been a very innovative company, developing very competitive products.\" When a company is looking at a demutualisation he thinks it is these kinds of issues which should be considered. But, he says it is hard for voting members to understand the subtlety of these issues, which can be very technical and are usually only of interest to analysts and advisers. </p> <p>Mr Kohn bought an endowment policy with Standard Life six weeks ago. He will not be entitled to any windfall profits, but says this dosn't matter as he intends to vote against demutualisation anyway. At the moment he has every confidence in Standard Life, but concedes that if it goes public he might have to re-evaluate both his policy with them and the extent to which he recommends them to clients.</p>",

He thinks demutualisation is right for some, but not for others, and only a proper analysis of a company's workings will establish if it is right for them. \"If a company has not got the individual resources to stay in business or develop its business as a mutual, then it is in the best interests of its policyholders that it goes public.\" This, he says, was the case with Norwich Union which demutualised in 1996, writes Jessica McCallin. Mr Kohn kept his life endownment policy with Norwich Union through the demutualisation until the present day. And so far says he is happy with the way it is performing: \"Publicly listed companies are always under pressure from shareholders. I don't mind this and don't mind the fact that they may not be paying me the maximum possible rate because of it, so long as at the end of my endowment policy's term it meets with my satisfaction.\" But this is where the problem starts. So far, Norwich Union might be doing fine, but the issue with these newly-demutualised companies and the policies they sell is with their long-term performance. Mr Kohn concedes that it is still too early to say if Norwich Union will continue to meet the mark, but if it were to do badly, any benefits he gained from his windfall shares would be lost. In Standard Life's case Mr Kohn is adamant that it should remain mutual. \"The company has produced consistently outstanding results. It has been a very innovative company, developing very competitive products.\" When a company is looking at a demutualisation he thinks it is these kinds of issues which should be considered. But, he says it is hard for voting members to understand the subtlety of these issues, which can be very technical and are usually only of interest to analysts and advisers. Mr Kohn bought an endowment policy with Standard Life six weeks ago. He will not be entitled to any windfall profits, but says this dosn't matter as he intends to vote against demutualisation anyway. At the moment he has every confidence in Standard Life, but concedes that if it goes public he might have to re-evaluate both his policy with them and the extent to which he recommends them to clients.",

Yet the banks are now certain that millions of us are going to switch to full internet banking over the next year; either the divorce rate is about to soar or the net is really going to shake off the average customer's inertia about moving their bank account. </p> <p>E-banking is currently at fever pitch. On Monday, Abbey National unveiled its own-brand net bank, integrated into existing Abbey branch and phone-based services. On Tuesday it was Halifax's turn, with the launch of IF - Intelligent Finance - a completely new-brand electronic bank which it believes is so revolutionary that it is trying to patent its business processes. </p> <p>Wednesday and it was LloydsTSB shouting about Evolvebank.com, another separately branded bank - although you won't see it until the end of the year. On Thursday, Egg said it was going to open internet current accounts in September. Then on Friday it was back to Abbey National, releasing some details about its separate net bank launch, Cahoot, due to go live in June. </p> <p>IF claims it is going to mop up 4m customers; Abbey National is going for 1m by the year end; Egg already has 1m savers; LloydsTSB, knowing that it is much more at risk of cannibalising its own customers, is a little more coy about numbers. </p> <p>A blaze of TV publicity awaits us as the banks attempt to go hip and trendy; IF has paid \u00a30.5m to use Fatboy Slim music in its ads. </p> <p>The freebies are also flowing. IF has snapped up 150,000 internet-enabled Wap phones (there's currently only 200,000 in the whole of the UK) to hand out free to customers who pay in their salary; Woolwich has a similar deal with Nokia phones, while Abbey National is following a different tack. So keen is it to get financial journalists logged on to its service that this week it was handing them, on long-term loan, \u00a31,000 Hewlett Packard laptops loaded with free money. </p> <p>Should you make the leap into cyberspace and trust the net with your monthly salary cheque? Jobs &amp; Money found this week that promises about hassle-free switching of direct debits and standing orders can ring hollow, and the instant transfer hopes of users may be disappointed. </p> <p>Yet there is a growing number of 'early adopter' satisfied users, and if promises of interest maximisation (or minimisation for those with overdrafts and credit cards) come true, millions may follow in their footsteps. The price, however, is likely to be paid in widespread axing of bank branches that will make Barclays' recent controversial closures look small beer. </p> <p>Eammon Anderson, a chartered accountant with Wal-Mart from Ilkley, Yorkshire, is one of the enthusiastic early adopters. \"I joined Lloydstsb.com two months ago and the service at both the website and the phonebank alternative is exceptional. But it was completely different at NatWest, where I had a big battle just trying to get my mother's account put online.\" </p> <p>Like most e-bank users, Mr Anderson tends to use lunchtimes to go online at work. \"I can click, see my balance, transfer \u00a350, pay a bill, all in a couple of minutes. I love it.\" His only gripe is that the net service does not yet completely mirror the phone service; at Lloydstsb.com you can change your standing orders, but you can't set one up from scratch. </p> <p>Far less impressed is Connie Harvey, a community support worker in Camden, North London. She joined Smile, one of the first net-only banks (set up by Cooperative Bank) but it certainly hasn't clicked with her. She signed up in November last year, switching her account from Nationwide Building Society. \"I really wish I had never bothered,\" she says. </p> <p>Smile told her, \"don't worry, we'll switch your standing orders and direct debits over - just sign here\". Except that it didn't happen. In December and January her mortgage payment bounced - because it was still coming out of her now-defunct Nationwide account. </p> <p>The same happened with a string of other direct debits and standing orders. In total she was charged more than \u00a3300 in fees for bounced payments. Smile has since paid her nearly \u00a3400 in compensation, but Ms Harvey says: \"It's been the worst financial decision I've ever made. They've now paid up, but it should never have happened, and all along they were never very apologetic.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Smile says Ms Harvey's case is highly unusual, if not unique. \"Such problems are certainly extremely rare. The vast majority of our customers will tell you that the system has worked perfectly for them.\" </p> <p>But it is the hassle factor about switching salary, direct debits and standing orders that will hold most people back from going to a new internet bank. The internet banks promise to provide pain-free switching by asking applicants to sign a mandate which will allow the bank to approach your existing bank to obtain a list of your direct debits and standing orders. A copy is emailed to you, and you confirm which ones must be transferred. </p> <p>With direct debits, the internet bank approaches the company, such as the gas or electricity company, and tells them to debit your new inter net account in future. \"Normally it works like clockwork,\" says Smile. </p> <p>You can obtain the convenience benefits of internet banking without the potential hassle of switching your salary and direct debits by applying for an online account with your existing bank, although HSBC is yet to go online in the same way as Barclays, LloydsTSB and NatWest. LloydsTSB claims that any of its existing customers can sign up and go online within 2-3 minutes, although others will not allow you to go live until you are sent a password in the post. </p> <p>Using your existing bank also has the advantage that your internet account will be integrated with your branch-based account. You retain your relationship with your existing branch and telephone banking service as well as being able to view your account, pay bills and transfer money on-screen at any time over the internet. </p> <p>But the drawback is that convenience is all you gain. You won't receive any extra interest on your savings or current account above what you already earn at the branch. In contrast, the pure internet banks, which don't have the huge cost of maintaining branch networks and old IT systems, will offer you rates on savings, mortgages and credit cards that will be hard to beat. </p> <p>This is the philosophy behind IF from Halifax, Smile from Co-op, Cahoot from Abbey National and Evolve from LloydsTSB, though don't jump too soon; only Smile is actually open today. </p> <p>IF's offering (it opens in July) is currently one of the most impressive.

      "bodyText": "Statistics tell us that people are more likely to get divorced than switch their bank accounts. Yet the banks are now certain that millions of us are going to switch to full internet banking over the next year; either the divorce rate is about to soar or the net is really going to shake off the average customer's inertia about moving their bank account. E-banking is currently at fever pitch. On Monday, Abbey National unveiled its own-brand net bank, integrated into existing Abbey branch and phone-based services. On Tuesday it was Halifax's turn, with the launch of IF - Intelligent Finance - a completely new-brand electronic bank which it believes is so revolutionary that it is trying to patent its business processes. Wednesday and it was LloydsTSB shouting about Evolvebank.com, another separately branded bank - although you won't see it until the end of the year. On Thursday, Egg said it was going to open internet current accounts in September. Then on Friday it was back to Abbey National, releasing some details about its separate net bank launch, Cahoot, due to go live in June. IF claims it is going to mop up 4m customers; Abbey National is going for 1m by the year end; Egg already has 1m savers; LloydsTSB, knowing that it is much more at risk of cannibalising its own customers, is a little more coy about numbers. A blaze of TV publicity awaits us as the banks attempt to go hip and trendy; IF has paid \u00a30.5m to use Fatboy Slim music in its ads. The freebies are also flowing. IF has snapped up 150,000 internet-enabled Wap phones (there's currently only 200,000 in the whole of the UK) to hand out free to customers who pay in their salary; Woolwich has a similar deal with Nokia phones, while Abbey National is following a different tack. So keen is it to get financial journalists logged on to its service that this week it was handing them, on long-term loan, \u00a31,000 Hewlett Packard laptops loaded with free money. Should you make the leap into cyberspace and trust the net with your monthly salary cheque? Jobs &amp; Money found this week that promises about hassle-free switching of direct debits and standing orders can ring hollow, and the instant transfer hopes of users may be disappointed. Yet there is a growing number of 'early adopter' satisfied users, and if promises of interest maximisation (or minimisation for those with overdrafts and credit cards) come true, millions may follow in their footsteps. The price, however, is likely to be paid in widespread axing of bank branches that will make Barclays' recent controversial closures look small beer. Eammon Anderson, a chartered accountant with Wal-Mart from Ilkley, Yorkshire, is one of the enthusiastic early adopters. \"I joined Lloydstsb.com two months ago and the service at both the website and the phonebank alternative is exceptional. But it was completely different at NatWest, where I had a big battle just trying to get my mother's account put online.\" Like most e-bank users, Mr Anderson tends to use lunchtimes to go online at work. \"I can click, see my balance, transfer \u00a350, pay a bill, all in a couple of minutes. I love it.\" His only gripe is that the net service does not yet completely mirror the phone service; at Lloydstsb.com you can change your standing orders, but you can't set one up from scratch. Far less impressed is Connie Harvey, a community support worker in Camden, North London. She joined Smile, one of the first net-only banks (set up by Cooperative Bank) but it certainly hasn't clicked with her. She signed up in November last year, switching her account from Nationwide Building Society. \"I really wish I had never bothered,\" she says. Smile told her, \"don't worry, we'll switch your standing orders and direct debits over - just sign here\". Except that it didn't happen. In December and January her mortgage payment bounced - because it was still coming out of her now-defunct Nationwide account. The same happened with a string of other direct debits and standing orders. In total she was charged more than \u00a3300 in fees for bounced payments. Smile has since paid her nearly \u00a3400 in compensation, but Ms Harvey says: \"It's been the worst financial decision I've ever made. They've now paid up, but it should never have happened, and all along they were never very apologetic.\" A spokesman for Smile says Ms Harvey's case is highly unusual, if not unique. \"Such problems are certainly extremely rare. The vast majority of our customers will tell you that the system has worked perfectly for them.\" But it is the hassle factor about switching salary, direct debits and standing orders that will hold most people back from going to a new internet bank. The internet banks promise to provide pain-free switching by asking applicants to sign a mandate which will allow the bank to approach your existing bank to obtain a list of your direct debits and standing orders. A copy is emailed to you, and you confirm which ones must be transferred. With direct debits, the internet bank approaches the company, such as the gas or electricity company, and tells them to debit your new inter net account in future. \"Normally it works like clockwork,\" says Smile. You can obtain the convenience benefits of internet banking without the potential hassle of switching your salary and direct debits by applying for an online account with your existing bank, although HSBC is yet to go online in the same way as Barclays, LloydsTSB and NatWest. LloydsTSB claims that any of its existing customers can sign up and go online within 2-3 minutes, although others will not allow you to go live until you are sent a password in the post. Using your existing bank also has the advantage that your internet account will be integrated with your branch-based account. You retain your relationship with your existing branch and telephone banking service as well as being able to view your account, pay bills and transfer money on-screen at any time over the internet. But the drawback is that convenience is all you gain. You won't receive any extra interest on your savings or current account above what you already earn at the branch. In contrast, the pure internet banks, which don't have the huge cost of maintaining branch networks and old IT systems, will offer you rates on savings, mortgages and credit cards that will be hard to beat. This is the philosophy behind IF from Halifax, Smile from Co-op, Cahoot from Abbey National and Evolve from LloydsTSB, though don't jump too soon; only Smile is actually open today. IF's offering (it opens in July) is currently one of the most impressive. It has taken the all-in-one account concept pioneered by Virgin and First Active, and taken it a step further. All-in-one accounts put your salary, mortgage, savings and credit card into one pot of money and then calculate the interest. So as soon as your salary is paid into the account it reduces your mortgage amount, cutting the amount of interest paid. And instead of earning an after-tax 3% on your savings, it reduces your mortgage by the same amount, saving you interest charged at 7-8%. So far the vast majority of people have been resistant to the concept of throwing all their accounts together into one; IF challenges this by keeping all the money in separate pots, but uses sophisticated technology to treat your account as if it was in one pot only, and clips your costs accordingly. IF says the process will save the average customer \u00a3750 a year. Another feature of IF is that it will issue cash machine cards that can be used free across the Halifax ATM network, and will have a call centre that allows you to handle your accounts over the phone if you can't, or don't want to, use the net. However, customers can only open an IF account if they agree to pay their monthly salary cheque to the account. IF chief executive Jim Spowart says: \"The trouble with the Virgin account is that you always look permanently overdrawn. All our research suggests that keeping Chinese Walls between accounts is what customers want.\" However, Mr Spowart says there will be no loss-leading special internet deals such as those offered by Egg. Of the others, there is barely a whisper about the products Cahoot will offer, but Evolve is promising to beat all comers.

Television sets fitted to receive Open TV digital broadcasts via satellite will offer the same interactive banking services currently limited to PCs connected to the internet.

Matthews's Pluto has a cold, brittle orbit. </p> <p>The choir of female voices appears in Pluto with the final music of the piece, but this point of contact with Holst only emphasises the differences between the two endings. </p> <p>Pluto is a kind of negative coda to The Planets, where the comforting characterisations of the other movements seem to dissipate into the furthest, frozen reaches of the cosmos. But paradoxically, it is only because Matthews's music is so well integrated as part of the trajectory of Holst's original that his Pluto is so effective in expressing this emotional difference and distance: a fascinating and illuminating compositional feat.</p> <p><br> ***** Unmissable<br> **** Recommended<br> *** Enjoyable<br> ** Mediocre<br> * Terrible</p>",

Matthews's solution is remarkably successful in treading a thin musical line between keeping faith with the intentions of Holst's original project, without descending into mere pastiche of The Planets' harmonic and textural idiosyncrasies. Matthews's Pluto emerges seamlessly from the wordless choir at the end of Neptune, who instead of disintegrating into nothingness, as Holst suggested they should, disappear into Pluto's pianissimo and prestissimo music of scurrying but evanescent string figuration and glittering tuned percussion. Matthews doffs his cap to Holst with Pluto's metre of five-four, which it shares with Holst's Mars and Neptune, as well as in the distinctly Martian rhythms that periodically break through to Pluto's surface. But what Matthews has added is a series of elemental contrasts between intense melodiousness, biting rhythms and extreme dynamics that define a music of the outer, elusive limits. Matthews's Pluto has a cold, brittle orbit. The choir of female voices appears in Pluto with the final music of the piece, but this point of contact with Holst only emphasises the differences between the two endings. Pluto is a kind of negative coda to The Planets, where the comforting characterisations of the other movements seem to dissipate into the furthest, frozen reaches of the cosmos. But paradoxically, it is only because Matthews's music is so well integrated as part of the trajectory of Holst's original that his Pluto is so effective in expressing this emotional difference and distance: a fascinating and illuminating compositional feat. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

      "body": "<p>This is the time in their tour when the Zimbabweans ought to be conducting clandestine investigations into who among the side might have run over a black cat or smashed the mirror while shaving. Things do not seem to be going their way in the run-up to the first test, which begins on Thursday. </p> <p>There was a crumb of comfort yesterday, however, with the indication that their most effective bowler, Heath Streak, will play at Lord's even though he is unlikely to be 100% fit, having aggravated a knee injury during Zimbabwe's trouncing at Kent last week. </p> <p>The tourists' captain Andy Flower confirmed that he was desperate for Streak to play next week. \"It is too early for us to say definitely that he will play, but my understanding is that he will be looking to. He is the linchpin of our attack and its effectiveness is reduced that much without him. He is not exactly a talisman but the rest of the attack are happier with him there. We shall just have to nurse him through in short spells.\" </p> <p>The injury originally occurred during Zimbabwe's test against Australia in Harare last October when Streak took five for 93 in the first innings. An operation meant he then missed single tests home and away against South Africa and a three-match series against Sri Lanka, before returning to face West Indies in the Caribbean. However, after he took nine wickets in the first test in Trinidad, bowling his side into what ought to have been a winning position, the knee went again during the second match. </p> <p>The news of Streak's likely return was a fillip on a day when the rain again intervened. Having ruined the opening match of the tour against Hampshire, it washed out the first day of the four-day match in Chelmsford yesterday, Zimbabwe's final chance of practice before the first test begins.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This is the time in their tour when the Zimbabweans ought to be conducting clandestine investigations into who among the side might have run over a black cat or smashed the mirror while shaving. Things do not seem to be going their way in the run-up to the first test, which begins on Thursday. There was a crumb of comfort yesterday, however, with the indication that their most effective bowler, Heath Streak, will play at Lord's even though he is unlikely to be 100% fit, having aggravated a knee injury during Zimbabwe's trouncing at Kent last week. The tourists' captain Andy Flower confirmed that he was desperate for Streak to play next week. \"It is too early for us to say definitely that he will play, but my understanding is that he will be looking to. He is the linchpin of our attack and its effectiveness is reduced that much without him. He is not exactly a talisman but the rest of the attack are happier with him there. We shall just have to nurse him through in short spells.\" The injury originally occurred during Zimbabwe's test against Australia in Harare last October when Streak took five for 93 in the first innings. An operation meant he then missed single tests home and away against South Africa and a three-match series against Sri Lanka, before returning to face West Indies in the Caribbean. However, after he took nine wickets in the first test in Trinidad, bowling his side into what ought to have been a winning position, the knee went again during the second match. The news of Streak's likely return was a fillip on a day when the rain again intervened. Having ruined the opening match of the tour against Hampshire, it washed out the first day of the four-day match in Chelmsford yesterday, Zimbabwe's final chance of practice before the first test begins.",

      "body": "<p>Brian Lara last night performed one of the most astonishing U-turns in cricket history. The charismatic West Indian batsman announced that he would tour England this summer, less than 24 hours after saying he would stay at home in the Caribbean. </p> <p>It left West Indies followers in a state of bewilderment mixed with profound relief and, in some quarters, anger. At Lord's there was merely undisguised delight that he would be touring. But his actions have renewed speculation that all is far from well with the brilliant but impetuous former captain, who had psychiatric counselling last month in a New Jersey clinic. </p> <p>The news that he will tour is a relief not only to the marketing men at Lord's and West Indies' sponsor Sandals but also to cricket lovers throughout both nations. But the latest episode has reopened the tired debate about his future in the game. </p> <p>Yesterday West Indians awoke to the news that he had retired from international cricket. Later in the morning Michael Findlay, West Indies' chairman of selectors, announced the 16-man squad that will leave for England on May 31. Lara's name was included. </p> <p>The selectors - Findlay, the coach Roger Harper, Joel Garner, Joey Carew and the captain Jimmy Adams - had met in Guyana on Tuesday to select the squad. Immediately before the meeting, Lara informed Findlay that he would be unavailable because his mother was unwell. When this story was broken by Tony Cozier, the leading commentator in the Caribbean, it immediately led to exaggerated reports that Lara's entire international career was over. Then on Wednesday evening Lara told Findlay he would be available after all. </p> <p>Findlay said yesterday: \"You are all aware that Brian Lara had indicated to the board he wanted a rest from the game and was seeking professional help. He has done so and is satisfied with the help he has received. </p> <p>\"Shortly before we selected the squad to tour England, Lara then announced that he was unavailable. It was a sudden announcement that caught all of us by surprise. </p> <p>\"However, Lara has since told the board that he is available. His letter said, 'I am pleased to inform you that I will be available for the upcoming tour of England. As you are aware, the family circumstances which prompted my letter remain unchanged. But arrangements have been put in place while I am on tour. I am looking forward to this tour of England and the board can count on my full support in this regard. I wish to thank the board for their patience and understanding.' </p> <p>\"The family circumstances are very delicate,\" Findlay continued. \"Brian Lara's mother is ill. A couple of days before we met in Guyana to select the squad Brian visited his mother and felt she looked a little weaker and was concerned. I think that must have prompted his decision, on the spur of the moment, to make himself unavailable for the tour. </p> <p>\"Subsequently he has had discussions with people close to him. I received a call late yesterday evening from an official of the board based in Trinidad telling me that Brian had informed him that he was available once again. I immediately contacted Brian, he explained the circumstances to me and he gave me an assurance that he was fully committed to the tour and that he is prepared to get himself ready and to practise between now and when the team leaves.\" </p> <p>After a dismal winter tour of New Zealand, Lara announced that he would be unavailable for the recent triangular series against Pakistan and Zimbabwe as well as the current test series against Pakistan. He said he needed a break. He always said, however, that he would tour this summer. </p> <p>If he had withdrawn from the England tour it would have cost him an estimated \u00a3100,000.

      "bodyText": "Brian Lara last night performed one of the most astonishing U-turns in cricket history. The charismatic West Indian batsman announced that he would tour England this summer, less than 24 hours after saying he would stay at home in the Caribbean. It left West Indies followers in a state of bewilderment mixed with profound relief and, in some quarters, anger. At Lord's there was merely undisguised delight that he would be touring. But his actions have renewed speculation that all is far from well with the brilliant but impetuous former captain, who had psychiatric counselling last month in a New Jersey clinic. The news that he will tour is a relief not only to the marketing men at Lord's and West Indies' sponsor Sandals but also to cricket lovers throughout both nations. But the latest episode has reopened the tired debate about his future in the game. Yesterday West Indians awoke to the news that he had retired from international cricket. Later in the morning Michael Findlay, West Indies' chairman of selectors, announced the 16-man squad that will leave for England on May 31. Lara's name was included. The selectors - Findlay, the coach Roger Harper, Joel Garner, Joey Carew and the captain Jimmy Adams - had met in Guyana on Tuesday to select the squad. Immediately before the meeting, Lara informed Findlay that he would be unavailable because his mother was unwell. When this story was broken by Tony Cozier, the leading commentator in the Caribbean, it immediately led to exaggerated reports that Lara's entire international career was over. Then on Wednesday evening Lara told Findlay he would be available after all. Findlay said yesterday: \"You are all aware that Brian Lara had indicated to the board he wanted a rest from the game and was seeking professional help. He has done so and is satisfied with the help he has received. \"Shortly before we selected the squad to tour England, Lara then announced that he was unavailable. It was a sudden announcement that caught all of us by surprise. \"However, Lara has since told the board that he is available. His letter said, 'I am pleased to inform you that I will be available for the upcoming tour of England. As you are aware, the family circumstances which prompted my letter remain unchanged. But arrangements have been put in place while I am on tour. I am looking forward to this tour of England and the board can count on my full support in this regard. I wish to thank the board for their patience and understanding.' \"The family circumstances are very delicate,\" Findlay continued. \"Brian Lara's mother is ill. A couple of days before we met in Guyana to select the squad Brian visited his mother and felt she looked a little weaker and was concerned. I think that must have prompted his decision, on the spur of the moment, to make himself unavailable for the tour. \"Subsequently he has had discussions with people close to him. I received a call late yesterday evening from an official of the board based in Trinidad telling me that Brian had informed him that he was available once again. I immediately contacted Brian, he explained the circumstances to me and he gave me an assurance that he was fully committed to the tour and that he is prepared to get himself ready and to practise between now and when the team leaves.\" After a dismal winter tour of New Zealand, Lara announced that he would be unavailable for the recent triangular series against Pakistan and Zimbabwe as well as the current test series against Pakistan. He said he needed a break. He always said, however, that he would tour this summer. If he had withdrawn from the England tour it would have cost him an estimated \u00a3100,000. It is understood that before he changed his mind he spoke to Alloy Lequay, the president of the Trinidad and Tobago Board of Control who is involved in a power struggle with Jamaica's Pat Rousseau for the presidency of the West Indies board. Feelings of relief are slowly being replaced by a resentment that Lara has once again placed the board and the selectors in a difficult situation. There are also rumours that his original decision to quit the tour was not motivated by family illness alone. At 31 he is getting on a bit to be a mixed-up kid but his mind is clearly still in a state of turmoil. So far, no one has bettered the opinion of the former Trinidad captain Bryan Davis, who said: \"Brian is a very talented, very charming big-headed boy.\" West Indies squad: J Adams (capt), S Campbell (vice-capt), B Lara, A Griffith, C Gayle, S Chanderpaul, W Hinds, R Jacobs (wkt), F Rose, C Ambrose, C Walsh, R King, R Sarwan, M Nagamootoo, N McLean, C Collymore.

The inaugural meeting of the Assembly, held at the Emmanuel Centre, Westminster, had been intended to bury the party divisions which are the hallmark of the Houses of Parliament. With the independent mayor Ken Livingstone sitting in the public section of the auditorium, party politics dominated from the start when the 25-strong body decided the election of a chairman and deputy chairman. Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green Assembly members successfully backed Labour's Trevor Phillips for chairman and the Liberal Democrats' Sally Hamwee for deputy chairman over two Conservative candidates - Elizabeth Howlett and Roger Evans. Conservative member Brian Coleman condemned the \"unpleasant little deal\" between the other parties. Making his opening address, Mr Phillips, who ran as deputy to Labour's defeated mayoral candidate Frank Dobson, said he hoped the forum would not become \"a sterile debating chamber\". He added: \"If I could say to my colleagues on the Conservative group: this is not a place for cheap debating points.\" For the Conservatives, group leader Bob Neill said his party would be a \"constructive opposition\". Green leader Darren Johnson appealed: \"We need to move away from the Westminster model of politics.\" Despite agreeing technical measures about the running of the Assembly, the politicians were again divided on party lines in a debate on whether to impose congestion charges to deter traffic in central London. The Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green alliance voted down a Conservative motion that called on the mayor to rule out congestion charging.",

The cabinet is divided over the issue, but Mr Murphy's remarks indicate that the position of the anti-reform camp has been strengthened by the difficulties over devolution. His remarks will be welcomed by opponents of electoral reform, who include the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. The two camps are gearing up for a battle over PR at this year's Labour party conference, although there is speculation that Blairites will shelve the issue to avoid an embarrassing defeat for supporters of reform. Mr Murphy's admission of the damage inflicted by the Alun Michael affair demonstrates that ministers are working hard to learn the lessons from the government's cack-handed approach to devolution. Today the popular Rhodri Morgan, who replaced Mr Michael as leader of Labour's minority administration in Wales, is the toast of Downing Street, despite Tony Blair's campaign to deny him the leadership of the party in Wales. Labour took a devastating pounding in last year's Welsh assembly elections, losing seats in its heartland areas of the South Wales valleys, as voters registered their disgust with the way in which Mr Michael was imposed as leader. Labour strategists hope that the combination of Mr Morgan, a popular footsoldier, and Mr Murphy, a Blair favourite with more street credibility than Mr Michael, will restore the party's fortunes. A coal miner's son, whose London office is decorated with a portrait of miners drawn with coal, Mr Murphy has been one of the government's most impressive performers. As Mo Mowlam's deputy in Northern Ireland, he played a crucial role in the negotiations running up to the Good Friday agreement. However, the new Morgan-Murphy double act has not led to an easier ride for Labour in the assembly where opposition parties have found yet more ammunition with which to attack the hapless agricul ture secretary, Christine Gwyther. In scenes worthy of a Whitehall farce, assembly members were told this week that they were powerless to keep Wales a GM free zone - as they have voted to do - after it emerged that farm-scale trials of a genetically modified form of forage maize were taking place in a field in Flintshire, north east Wales. Ms Gwyther was caught on the hop, believing that officials in London were trying to persuade the farmer in question to sow the crop in a field across the border in neighbouring Cheshire. Amid stormy scenes in the assembly chamber she made clear her unhappiness, but insisted that neither the assembly nor the UK government had the power to block the trial because the crop had consent under an EU directive. Plaid Cymru 's business manager, Ieuan Wyn Jones, acknowledges that relationships have become easier now that Labour is under the more relaxed leadership style of Mr Morgan. But he says it remains to be seen whether the new first secretary is willing to show a change in policy direction.

Read the debate and have your say <a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7527e\"> here.</a><br></p> <p><b>Dear Sara,</b> <br><br> There are very good reasons why the Independent Television Commission prohibits many goods and services from being advertised on television, among them faith healing, miracle working, the occult, religious fund-raising, pornography, guns and gun clubs, and why celebrities and medical practitioners are prohibited from promoting or endorsing medical products and services. This week's news that the ITC is consulting on a proposed relaxation of virtually all these rules reinforces the need for rigorous analysis of why such advertising has been banned in the past. Why is the ITC now recommending the removal of these prohibitions? Its press release says the aim is to \"modernise and simplify the regulatory approach in response to the changing broadcast and consumer environment\". But have you noticed viewers demanding a relaxation of these rules? I haven't. The ITC director of advertising, Stephen Locke, claims the intention is to find \"the right level of regulation to meet the changing marketplace\", but it seems more like a slippery slope taking Britain towards an American situation, where any product or service, no matter how dubious, is fair game, as long as it makes money for the advertisers and television companies. Take medical products. Television is the most powerful advertising medium devised; it reaches into every home and attracts the attention of all viewers, from the most sophisticated to the most vulnerable. Celebrity endorsements are more likely to sway the vulnerable than the sophisticated; advertising miracle cures could tempt the desperately ill or vulnerable to part with large sums of money.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Jocelyn Hay,<br> Chair,Voice of the Listener and Viewer<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Jocelyn,</b><br><br></p> <p>We are discussing a public consultation. The ITC hasn't made any final decisions and is encouraging viewers to send in their opinions. In contrast to your implication that the ITC has an ulterior motive, it is legally obliged to carry out this review, and has been asked to do so by the government. The human rights act obliges public authorities to ensure that any prohibition on the advertising of a legal product or service can be justified under the act, which guarantees commercial freedom of speech. In your rush to express outrage, you have neglected to note what the paper says. If you had, you would know that there is no question of the prohibition on advertising pornography, guns or gun clubs being lifted, and that your statement about relaxing \"virtually all\" rules is misleading in the extreme. Even if the ITC does lift existing prohibitions, advertisers would still have to abide by some of the most stringent regulations on taste, decency and misleadingness in Europe. We should encourage proper consideration of the paper itself, rather than a kneejerk reaction to it.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Sara Price<br> Head of public affairs, The Advertising Association<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Sara,</b><br><br></p> <p>I'm not criticising consultations, but the recommendations for removing rules or amending them. The rules are there to protect viewers and the integrity of TV programmes. I have concerns about both. If viewers have been adversely affected, the ITC will take it up with the advertiser. But this seems to place the burden of proof on the viewer. Who decides whether an ad for a miracle cure was misleading? What redress will a viewer have from the offending advertiser if it doesn't work? The ITC proposals seem to shift the burden of proof to the viewer. Are we to turn every viewer's claim into a legal case in which both sides have to be represented by lawyers? You mention the proposed human rights act. Under the European convention on human rights, advertisers have always been able to challenge the ITC's code of advertising in the European court, but, significantly, have never availed themselves of this. The new act merely simplifies that procedure and enables UK judges to take specific decisions. And the television without frontiers directive of the EU requires member states to protect the mental, moral and physical health of minors.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Jocelyn<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Jocelyn,</b><br><br> Read the details of the consultation paper. Under the proposed new rules, religious advertisers who believe in the power of God to heal (faith healing) could exercise their religious freedom of expression and make reference to that as an article of faith. They could not make claims for the efficacy of faith healing. The question of who decides whether those claims are misleading would not arise. As regards permissible claims, the burden of proof is clearly on the advertiser and not with the viewer. Nothing in the ITC consultation undermines that principle or strict rules prohibiting misleadingness that will remain part of the codes. To protect viewers, advertisements are subject to a stringent and compulsory procedure prior to broadcast, carried out by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre. Any advertiser who wishes to make a claim must provide the BACC with objective, verifiable evidence or its ad is refused clearance. The only proposed change to the rules on advertising to children in the UK is to allow advertisements for merchandise based on children's programmes to be shown during children's television. No product or service which might be harmful to children may be advertised during children's programming and certain ads may only be broadcast after the watershed. So, unless there is some reason to believe that Pok*mon yoyos would undermine the principle of child protection, I'm not clear what your objection is. <br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Sara<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Sara</b><br><br> My concern is still the lack of any evidence for public demand for lighter rules on advertising. Your support of advertising merchandise based on children's programmes during children's television will alarm many parents. New technology and the incorporation of the human rights convention are being used as an excuse to relax the laws. Neither justifies such a change, which surely results from a long campaign by the advertisers, supported by satellite and cable operators, and now the ITV companies, for lighter regulation. ITC concessions on sponsorship have already begun to compromise the integrity of programmes. If all these new recommendations are accepted, they might end high-quality commercially funded public service television in Britain. Please attend our conference in London next week on public service broadcasting and the information society, focusing on the funding and scheduling of children's television and how European and World Trade Organisation policies will affect the future regulation of British broadcasting, telecommunications and the internet. I hope all readers will send the ITC comments about this week's recommendations. <br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Jocelyn<br><br></p> <p><b>Dear Jocelyn,</b><br><br> You appear to assume that the interests of viewers and advertisers are opposed. But is it in the interests of the industry to promote high quality programmes that generate good audiences. If programme integrity and standards, and audience viewing figures, were under threat, this industry would be the first to complain. You refer to the human rights act as an excuse, as though the ITC were able to ignore its legal obligations. This code review does not require an excuse, nor is the impetus behind it industry pressure, unless you classify the government as an industry pressure group. It is very rare that consumers make vociferous demands for deregulation. In 1955, toilet paper was a restricted category. I doubt there was huge public demand for deregulation. But I think it unlikely that anyone would argue that restrictions on the advertising of toilet tissue could be justified now, nor that viewers have suffered any major disbenefit from the Andrex puppy. Viewers have benefited from the competition and product improvement that advertising has brought to this and other categories. I look forward to explaining to your conference delegates the importance of advertising revenue in providing investment in high quality programming. I, too, encourage readers to write to the ITC: that is the point of a public consultation. I am sure their responses will be thoughtful and not kneejerk reactions. If only the strict rules on misleadingness that apply to advertising applied to headlines, perhaps some of this week's unfounded outrage could have been avoided.<br><br> Yours sincerely,<br> Sara<br></p>",

      "body": "<p>At the end of the Coen brothers film Barton Fink, the eponymous writer finds himself face to face with shotgun-toting Madman Mundt. Until then Barton has only known Madman Mundt as Charlie Meadows, a working stiff in the next hotel room about whom he knows nothing but presumes to be the personification of the \"common man\" he celebrates in his plays. \"Why me, Charlie, why me?\" asks Barton, fearing for his life as the hotel blazes and the Madman prepares to kill some more. Charlie tells him why: \"Because you DON'T LISTEN!\" </p> <p>This failure to listen has become a preoccupation in several recent American films whose protagonists become violent in order to define and perhaps even to redeem themselves. In an affectless society in which next almost everybody is alienated from everybody else, violence may seem to be the only way of connecting. In American Psycho the yuppie Wall Street dealer Patrick Bateman leaves a long confession to a series of murders on his lawyer's answering machine, but his lawyer regards it as a joke. He tells people to their faces that he would like to kill them and eat their remains, but no one hears. </p> <p>In Fight Club, too, the Narrator inhabits a world in which \"nobody cares if you live or die, and the feeling is fucking mutual\". He attends cancer support groups in order to get someone to listen to him, in order to experience the human warmth denied to him in the rest of his life. In the book, he explains this fascination with such encounters (with dubious syntax): \"This is why I loved support groups so much, if people thought you were dying, they gave you their full attention.\" True, the Narrator isn't dying like many of the other men who attend the support groups, but to be a faker in such circumstances is as authentic as he can manage. Until, that is, he gets into fighting. </p> <p>The spark for Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club, came when the author got beaten up on holiday. \"The other people who were camping near us wanted to drink and party all night long, and I tried to get them to shut up one night, and they literally beat the crap out of me. I went back to work just so bashed, and horrible looking. People didn't ask me what had happened. I think they were afraid of the answer. I realised that if you looked bad enough, people would not want to know what you did in your spare time. They don't want to know the bad things about you. And the key was to look so bad that no one would ever, ever ask. And that was the idea behind Fight Club.\" </p> <p>Inspired by the camping trip, Palahniuk got into more fights. \"I discovered that I'd never been in fights, and went, wow, that was sort of fun. That was a great release, and yeah, it hurts a little bit, but I lived through it. And it made me really curious about what I was capable of. And after that, if the opportunity arose, I didn't hesitate to get in a fight. So through the writing of the book, there was a period where I was in fights pretty regularly. My friends never wanted to go out with me, because I was always looking.\"</p> <p>Pleasant, soft-spoken and surprisingly unthreatening (at least during our phone conversation), Palahniuk tells me that what he found most striking was that whenever he returned to work cut and bruised no one would want to hear what he had really got up to at the weekend: \"They want you to say, 'No, I didn't do anything special.' And then they'll tell you about their weekend.\" </p> <p>There's more to Palanhiuk's taut, hilarious, anti-consumerist, nihilistic novel than transformative fisticuffs, of course, but the notion that you might learn something useful from recognising that society trundles along through denying the ugly, destructive, even healthily self-destructive parts of ourselves, is Fight Club's chief idea. It's why the novel's anarchic anti-hero, Tyler Durden, sets up a string of clandestine fight clubs where men can escape the alienation of their day jobs and the sterile acquisitiveness of their apartments, and connect through physical contact. In Palahniuk's literary world, black eyes and fat lips are signs of spiritual health on the part of otherwise alienated white collar young men. \"There's a redeeming value to taking a punch under controlled circumstances,\" says Palanhiuk. </p> <p>Fight Club is in many respects the 90s reply to American Psycho, Bret Easton Ellis's satire on youthful white collar greed and banality in Wall Street in the 80s. Like American Psycho's narrator Patrick Bateman, Fight Club's Narrator is devoid of identity; Palahniuk doesn't even bother to give him a name. Like Bateman, his identity, such as it is, is composed mostly from the things he owns. The Narrator admits at one point, \"I'd collected shelves full of different mustard, some stone-ground, some English pub style. There were 14 different flavors of fat-free salad dressing, and seven kinds of capers.\" Nobody needs seven kinds of capers and, when they realise they don't, everything has to change. </p> <p>The best thing that happens to the Narrator is when his apartment is blown up into the night sky. Perhaps the Narrator did it himself, to escape a life in which he didn't so much own things as was owned by them. Or perhaps Durden did it. Durden is the flip side to the Narrator, an anarchic unconscious come to life, someone whose passionate impulses are not sublimated into acquiring dishwasher-safe crockery, and whose natural mode of speech is trenchant, tendentious and not a little bit preachy.</p> <p>\"You are not your job,\" he tells the Narrator in a salutary speech. \"You are not the money in your bank account. You are not the car you drive. You are not how much money is in your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis.\" You can imagine how this sort of stuff plays to alienated twentysomething desk clerks from Sacramento to Southend - or indeed anybody existentially dissatisfied with their lot. </p> <p> Hence the mantra that the Narrator recites to himself on the way to spiritual redemption: \"Deliver me from Swedish furniture. Deliver me from clever art. May I never be complete. May I never be content. May I never be perfect.\" </p> <p>Throughout the novel, men regularly get hospitalised after fights, clam chowders are defiled by urinating waiters in posh restaurants, men wound each other to focus on the spiritual aspect of pain, apartments are destroyed, BMWs ruined with baseball bats, and by the end a coast-to-coast secret society called Project Mayhem established by Durden seems poised to blow up corporate USA and dance in its ashes. And all this, Palahniuk encourages us to believe, is a good thing. Durden, who takes over the life of the Narrator in what one critic called a \"jihad against the American way\", tells his charge: \"Self improvement is masturbation. Self destruction is the answer.\" </p> <p>In Fight Club, the destruction has a nihilistic force. \"Without a period of ruin and collapse, we can't have anything better,\" Palahniuk tells me. He has read his Kierkegaard, Sartre and Camus and it shows in his nihilistic insistence on destroying lifestyles that serve nobody well, and recognising the importance of mortality.</p> <p>Palahniuk also found that Susan Faludi's book about the crisis of the modern male, Stiffed, struck a chord. But what is the modern male? In David Fincher's virtuosic, exciting film adaptation of Fight Club, Tyler Durden and the Narrator find themselves looking at a poster for Calvin Klein underwear - a pair of designer pants topped by an extraordinary sculpted washboard stomach and pumped pecs. \"Is that what a man looks like?\" asks Pitt rhetorically, sarcastically of this icon of self-improvement. Of course it isn't, we are meant to think: real men don't get so ludicrously buffed. </p> <p>True, there is something unconvincing about this scene in the film, mainly because Durden is played by Brad Pitt whose pristinely buffed upper body is as much part of the problem as the solution - it is as commodified as capers, though more sexy. Ever since his character in Thelma and Louise seduced Geena Davis by allowing her to strum his washboard stomach, Brad Pitt, with his perfect body, has been something women want and men want to be like. </p> <p>But Palahniuk's point remains: to neurotically perfect one's body is to submit to the same kind of tyranny that leads the Narrator to collect mustards. It is a point that Pitt, ironically, recognises: \"I find this truly insidiously damaging, this focus on exterior beauty, things, clothes, cars.\" No wonder the book has proved so appealing to men of a certain age. At times it seems to be exclusively about men whose fathers were absent during their childhoods. Durden, when contemplating a lover moving into his house, rejects the idea: \"We are a generation of men raised by women,\" he says. \"I'm beginning to wonder if another woman is what we really need.\" </p> <p>What's more, the men of the Narrator's generation are not able to define themselves in relation to male sacrifice or great challenges as their ancestors were. \"Our generation has had no Great Depression, no Great War,\" says Durden. \"Our war is spiritual. Our depression is our lives.\" At points like this, the novel suggests that all-male clubs are the only way men can re-establish their male potency. </p> <p>Edward Norton, who plays the Narrator in the film with aplomb, found the novel struck a chord: \"This was the first thing I read that said: 'This expresses the depth of the paralysis and the numbness and the despair that I feel in a lot of people I know.' \" \"But Fight Club isn't just for men, says Palahniuk. \"I find a lot of women getting in touch with me to ask where they can find fight clubs. The truth is I don't know.\" </p> <p>Palahniuk, 32, is surprised at Fight Club's critical and commercial success. \"I can't believe the response to the book. I never expected the book to be published. I had been rejected so many times because my work was seen as too dark and depressing, that when I sent off Fight Club, I thought it was just a fuck off to New York publishing. It was my last gesture.\" </p> <p>A journalism graduate from the University of Oregon, Palahniuk couldn't get a job in newspapers and instead became a diesel mechanic in Portland, where he still lives. \"It was dark, and frustrated, and sort of subversive, with lots of stunts because we were so frustrated with our jobs and our lives.\" Like Palahniuk's fights, some of these stunts have found their way into his books. The urinating waiters were his friends. He and some friends would tour show homes and steal prescription drugs they found in the medicine cabinets. This found its way into his latest novel. </p> <p>Since the success of Fight Club, Palahniuk has published two other novels. Survivor comes from the same dark corner of his mind as its predecessor: it transcribes the voice on a 747's recovered black box recorder. The voice belongs to a former cult member, Tender Branson, who has hijacked the airliner at 39,000 feet. The passengers have been forced to deplane, and the pilot has been invited to jump out with a parachute, leaving the plane on autopilot and Branson to record his memoir about life as a drone in a fundamentalist community and, later, a media messiah, before the plane crashes into the Australian outback. A satire both on cults and media manipulation, it is being adapted for the screen.</p> <p>His latest book, Invisible Monsters, yet to be published in Britain, is about a model who becomes disfigured when her jaw gets blown off. \"She's so used to being the centre of attention because of how she looks, and then becomes culturally invisible, no one will even acknowledge she's in the room, because she looks so hideous. It's about the process of discovering that she has so much more power being invisible than she did as a beautiful person.\" That interest in the redeeming force of self-destruction again. </p> <p>These two novels, he claimed on the internet recently, \"make Fight Club look like Little Women. My agent says offended folks will be standing in line to take my head off with a gun. I'm pretty much OK with that.\" At least such a reaction would show that people are finally listening to Chuck Palahniuk.</p> <p>\u0095 Fight Club is straight in at No 1 in the video chart.

      "bodyText": "At the end of the Coen brothers film Barton Fink, the eponymous writer finds himself face to face with shotgun-toting Madman Mundt. Until then Barton has only known Madman Mundt as Charlie Meadows, a working stiff in the next hotel room about whom he knows nothing but presumes to be the personification of the \"common man\" he celebrates in his plays. \"Why me, Charlie, why me?\" asks Barton, fearing for his life as the hotel blazes and the Madman prepares to kill some more. Charlie tells him why: \"Because you DON'T LISTEN!\" This failure to listen has become a preoccupation in several recent American films whose protagonists become violent in order to define and perhaps even to redeem themselves. In an affectless society in which next almost everybody is alienated from everybody else, violence may seem to be the only way of connecting. In American Psycho the yuppie Wall Street dealer Patrick Bateman leaves a long confession to a series of murders on his lawyer's answering machine, but his lawyer regards it as a joke. He tells people to their faces that he would like to kill them and eat their remains, but no one hears. In Fight Club, too, the Narrator inhabits a world in which \"nobody cares if you live or die, and the feeling is fucking mutual\". He attends cancer support groups in order to get someone to listen to him, in order to experience the human warmth denied to him in the rest of his life. In the book, he explains this fascination with such encounters (with dubious syntax): \"This is why I loved support groups so much, if people thought you were dying, they gave you their full attention.\" True, the Narrator isn't dying like many of the other men who attend the support groups, but to be a faker in such circumstances is as authentic as he can manage. Until, that is, he gets into fighting. The spark for Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club, came when the author got beaten up on holiday. \"The other people who were camping near us wanted to drink and party all night long, and I tried to get them to shut up one night, and they literally beat the crap out of me. I went back to work just so bashed, and horrible looking. People didn't ask me what had happened. I think they were afraid of the answer. I realised that if you looked bad enough, people would not want to know what you did in your spare time. They don't want to know the bad things about you. And the key was to look so bad that no one would ever, ever ask. And that was the idea behind Fight Club.\" Inspired by the camping trip, Palahniuk got into more fights. \"I discovered that I'd never been in fights, and went, wow, that was sort of fun. That was a great release, and yeah, it hurts a little bit, but I lived through it. And it made me really curious about what I was capable of. And after that, if the opportunity arose, I didn't hesitate to get in a fight. So through the writing of the book, there was a period where I was in fights pretty regularly. My friends never wanted to go out with me, because I was always looking.\" Pleasant, soft-spoken and surprisingly unthreatening (at least during our phone conversation), Palahniuk tells me that what he found most striking was that whenever he returned to work cut and bruised no one would want to hear what he had really got up to at the weekend: \"They want you to say, 'No, I didn't do anything special.' And then they'll tell you about their weekend.\" There's more to Palanhiuk's taut, hilarious, anti-consumerist, nihilistic novel than transformative fisticuffs, of course, but the notion that you might learn something useful from recognising that society trundles along through denying the ugly, destructive, even healthily self-destructive parts of ourselves, is Fight Club's chief idea. It's why the novel's anarchic anti-hero, Tyler Durden, sets up a string of clandestine fight clubs where men can escape the alienation of their day jobs and the sterile acquisitiveness of their apartments, and connect through physical contact. In Palahniuk's literary world, black eyes and fat lips are signs of spiritual health on the part of otherwise alienated white collar young men. \"There's a redeeming value to taking a punch under controlled circumstances,\" says Palanhiuk. Fight Club is in many respects the 90s reply to American Psycho, Bret Easton Ellis's satire on youthful white collar greed and banality in Wall Street in the 80s. Like American Psycho's narrator Patrick Bateman, Fight Club's Narrator is devoid of identity; Palahniuk doesn't even bother to give him a name. Like Bateman, his identity, such as it is, is composed mostly from the things he owns. The Narrator admits at one point, \"I'd collected shelves full of different mustard, some stone-ground, some English pub style. There were 14 different flavors of fat-free salad dressing, and seven kinds of capers.\" Nobody needs seven kinds of capers and, when they realise they don't, everything has to change. The best thing that happens to the Narrator is when his apartment is blown up into the night sky. Perhaps the Narrator did it himself, to escape a life in which he didn't so much own things as was owned by them. Or perhaps Durden did it. Durden is the flip side to the Narrator, an anarchic unconscious come to life, someone whose passionate impulses are not sublimated into acquiring dishwasher-safe crockery, and whose natural mode of speech is trenchant, tendentious and not a little bit preachy. \"You are not your job,\" he tells the Narrator in a salutary speech. \"You are not the money in your bank account. You are not the car you drive. You are not how much money is in your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis.\" You can imagine how this sort of stuff plays to alienated twentysomething desk clerks from Sacramento to Southend - or indeed anybody existentially dissatisfied with their lot. Hence the mantra that the Narrator recites to himself on the way to spiritual redemption: \"Deliver me from Swedish furniture. Deliver me from clever art. May I never be complete. May I never be content. May I never be perfect.\" Throughout the novel, men regularly get hospitalised after fights, clam chowders are defiled by urinating waiters in posh restaurants, men wound each other to focus on the spiritual aspect of pain, apartments are destroyed, BMWs ruined with baseball bats, and by the end a coast-to-coast secret society called Project Mayhem established by Durden seems poised to blow up corporate USA and dance in its ashes. And all this, Palahniuk encourages us to believe, is a good thing. Durden, who takes over the life of the Narrator in what one critic called a \"jihad against the American way\", tells his charge: \"Self improvement is masturbation. Self destruction is the answer.\" In Fight Club, the destruction has a nihilistic force. \"Without a period of ruin and collapse, we can't have anything better,\" Palahniuk tells me. He has read his Kierkegaard, Sartre and Camus and it shows in his nihilistic insistence on destroying lifestyles that serve nobody well, and recognising the importance of mortality. Palahniuk also found that Susan Faludi's book about the crisis of the modern male, Stiffed, struck a chord. But what is the modern male? In David Fincher's virtuosic, exciting film adaptation of Fight Club, Tyler Durden and the Narrator find themselves looking at a poster for Calvin Klein underwear - a pair of designer pants topped by an extraordinary sculpted washboard stomach and pumped pecs. \"Is that what a man looks like?\" asks Pitt rhetorically, sarcastically of this icon of self-improvement. Of course it isn't, we are meant to think: real men don't get so ludicrously buffed. True, there is something unconvincing about this scene in the film, mainly because Durden is played by Brad Pitt whose pristinely buffed upper body is as much part of the problem as the solution - it is as commodified as capers, though more sexy. Ever since his character in Thelma and Louise seduced Geena Davis by allowing her to strum his washboard stomach, Brad Pitt, with his perfect body, has been something women want and men want to be like. But Palahniuk's point remains: to neurotically perfect one's body is to submit to the same kind of tyranny that leads the Narrator to collect mustards. It is a point that Pitt, ironically, recognises: \"I find this truly insidiously damaging, this focus on exterior beauty, things, clothes, cars.\" No wonder the book has proved so appealing to men of a certain age. At times it seems to be exclusively about men whose fathers were absent during their childhoods. Durden, when contemplating a lover moving into his house, rejects the idea: \"We are a generation of men raised by women,\" he says. \"I'm beginning to wonder if another woman is what we really need.\" What's more, the men of the Narrator's generation are not able to define themselves in relation to male sacrifice or great challenges as their ancestors were. \"Our generation has had no Great Depression, no Great War,\" says Durden. \"Our war is spiritual.

Edward Norton, who plays the Narrator in the film with aplomb, found the novel struck a chord: \"This was the first thing I read that said: 'This expresses the depth of the paralysis and the numbness and the despair that I feel in a lot of people I know.' \" \"But Fight Club isn't just for men, says Palahniuk. \"I find a lot of women getting in touch with me to ask where they can find fight clubs.

Witness events in Cheltenham, where a row over the design of a wooden shed culminated in two neighbours attacking each other with garden implements. Trouble started when Martin Jones, 42, began building a shed hard against the fence dividing his garden from that of neighbour Laurence Pratt, 45. \"Pratt started it,\" claimed one of Mr Jones's friends. \"He said Martin's shed was a load of crap. Then Martin insulted Pratt's hydrangeas and it sort of escalated from there.\" Over the next few days the men exchanged increasingly vituperative remarks about each other's gardening skills, with Mr Pratt branding Mr Jones's geraniums \"tragic\" and Mr Jones calling Mr Pratt's herb garden \"an insult to herbs the world over\".

But if local reports are to be believed, the town and surrounding countryside have of late become something of a magnet for alien visitors. Over the past few months there have been a series of sightings of UFOs in the area, with witness reports proving remarkably consistent on the appearance of the flying saucers. \"It was a big ball of very bright light,\" recalled one woman. \"I thought I could see figures with big ears inside it, but to be honest it was moving so fast I couldn't be sure.\" People have been seeing strange objects in the sky around Hereford for almost two decades now. The number of incidents currently being reported, however, is unprecedented. \"We're getting three or four sightings a week at the moment,\" said one local UFO enthusiast. \"I've never known anything like it.\" Opinion is divided as to whether the mysterious balls of light are indeed alien spacecraft, and why they should be drawn to Hereford, although one local butcher has come up with a novel theory. \"It's our pies,\" he explained. \"They have the sort of delicate crust and deep meat filling that you just don't get anywhere else in the universe.\" Hereford Times Daring detective The Bill met Baywatch in Essex this week when a policeman commandeered a jet-ski in order to arrest a pair of suspected boat thieves. The excitement started when PC Graham Warboys, who was patrolling along the front at Shoebury West, received a radio message informing him that a stolen yacht had been spotted offshore. Lesser men might have been daunted by the 600 yards of freezing water between them and the suspect craft. Not so PC Warboys, who, spotting a jet-ski close to the water's edge, called the rider in and demanded he ferry him out to the boat. \"At first the jet-skier said told the copper to go away in no uncertain terms,\" explained a witness. \"But as soon as he realised it wasn't a joke, he got the policeman up behind him and whizzed off across the water.\" Two men were subsequently arrested, and PC Warboys was hailed as a hero. \"He might be a big, burly copper,\" said one colleague. \"But to us he'll always be Pamela Anderson.\" Essex Online Letter of the week Having had the privilege of appearing in The Witches at Hull New Theatre, I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed by one of my fellow witches, Marie Housam (Mail, May 4). However, I feel special thanks should go to both the professional cast and all the staff at the New Theatre for their helpful attitude towards us. I would also like a special mention to go to the dresser of the company, Gillie, who, with patience and good humour, transformed the 12 of us into hideous bald-headed witches, twice a day.

      "body": "<p><strong>AND THE WINNER (IE: LOSER) IS...</strong></p> <p>Let the Fiver take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London's West End and into the Worst Player of the Season 1999-2000 awards. Look, who are those ruffians hanging around the theatre? Get out of the way Chris Armstrong, you're not invited. Sling your hook John Hartson, you're yesterday's man. Have you no respect, Curtis Fleming? And as for that blind Italian picking at his studs...</p> <p>No, not everyone can get into the WPotS awards - no matter how many rogue votes they receive. Our shortlist contained only five of the poorest, most malingering Premiership players, and you voted for them in your hundreds. In fifth position (which makes him the best worst player of the year) was Dagenham Davor Suker, whose comedy misses against Leicester in the Cup won him a few sympathy votes. And in fourth place was Wim(p) Jonk, derided by Wednesday fans for his lack of commitment, abused by everyone else for his name.</p> <p>This pair can rest easy however, as they fell some way short of our top three. Steffen Freund, with 17% of the vote, romped into third place after mining a large seam of support amongst Tottenham fans. \"I wouldn't have him in my table football side,\" Guy Robbins insisted, while John Hindmarch observed that \"to stand out for badness in this Spurs team is saying something\". Perhaps Peterleic summed it up best when he lamented: \"If only he could have run toward Roy Keane\". Guess we'll never know.</p> <p>In second place came Mickael Silvestre. Like the blue-rinse Tories, you can be assured that the anti-Man Utd vote will mobilise at the slightest prompting and 'Melonhead' Mickael duly reaped 25% of the vote. The most common criticism of the young Frenchman was that he \"makes Jaap Stam / Gary Neville / Phil Neville / David May look good\", although Gordon K Smith was not alone in nominating him for \"pushing Raul onto his good foot in Big Cup\". His Championship medal will be hanging on his neck like an albatross, we're sure.</p> <p>But with 45% of the vote, \u00a310m Chris Sutton is the overwhelming winner of a poll some were surprised even took place, so convinced were they of the outcome. \"The worst buy since President Kennedy's convertible,\" said the nattily-named /I=M/S=Brown/GQ=1/. For JRJ Crump, Chris is \"the only player who makes Andy Booth look like a six-a-season goal machine\", while Craig Allen will never forget the man who \"p*ssed on my mate's bar in Norwich in 1992\". Chris Sutton, you are the Fiver's Worst Player of the Season 1999-2000 and if you are in any way related to a M Sutton of Woldingham, Surrey, then we're afraid he's disowned you.</p> <p><strong>ACROSS THE WATER THIS SUMMER</strong></p> <p>You can now subscribe to the Euro, the Fiver's major-championship-in-a-bottle, by going to <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk\">our home page</a> and clicking on some box or other on the front page.

As long as the word 'succeeded' appears on it, everything's fine, me hearties!</p> <p><strong>IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON</strong></p> <p>Sun, sea and sand. Pints, powders and prostitutes. But while most football players are already planning their summer holidays, there's still a job to be done this Sunday for some Premiership teams. Bradford and Wimbledon will be psyching themselves up to uselessly clump the ball about the pitch in the hope of avoiding relegation, while Leeds and Liverpool will preparing to stylishly grab the final Big Cup place by, er, uselessly clumping the ball about the pitch.</p> <p>No-longer-crazy (and that's official!) Wimbledon have injury problems ahead of their visit to the Dell. They're without broken-leg victim Michael Hughes and are sweating on the state of Kenny Cunningham's groin. But it's not all bad news for Terry Burton because John Hartson, the big lumbering oaf, is serving out a suspension and won't be getting in the way.</p> <p>And at least the Dons have their fate in their own hands (as do Leeds, whose only injury worry for their visit to West Ham concerns captain Lucas Radebe). The same can't be said of Bradford or Liverpool, who will both be scuttling around Valley Parade in a pathetically desperate fashion.</p> <p>The hosts are hoping the slightly-knocked Peter Beagrie and Wayne Jacobs will be fit to start, while Liverpool have wrapped Sander Westerveld and Sami Hyypia in Rick Parry-approved cotton wool until kick-off. The return to the Liverpool ranks of Michael Owen and Dietmar Hamann could give the visitors the edge, but whatever happens here, chances are there'll be tears before bedtime.</p> <p>Now, where did we put that brochure for Torremolinos?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"They meet in a restaurant and write on pieces of paper; that one will get the title, that one will be relegated. I no longer have any confidence in anything or anyone.\" - A low point, shall we say, for a reflective Gheorgie Hagi, who has pledged to fight corruption in the Romanian league.</p> <p><strong>WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD</strong></p> <p>Yes, yes, we hear you. Fifa executive David Will isn't English, as we stated in yesterday's Quote of the Day, he's Scottish. By the way, all your nasty emails made us cry. Happy now?</p> <p><strong>JOIN US!</strong></p> <p>When Fifa head honcho Sepp Blatter was heckled during a particular boozy PFA dinner recently, England's chances of hosting the 2006 World Cup went down quicker than a German striker in the penalty box. But while everybody else was writing off our chances, Martin Peters and Gordon Banks decided to get up off their World Cup-winning backsides and launch www.backthebid.com, an FA-backed website to collect messages of support for England's bid. </p> <p>Jolly good show, the Fiver thought - and we gaily logged on to express our good wishes. But when we saw the spaced-out video intro and the bogey-green background - surely Banksy's only got one gammy eye? - we started to have serious doubts. Those doubts escalated when we realised the content consisted of a solitary speech bubble proclaiming: \"England hasn't hosted Fifa's World Cup since 1966, the last time we won!\" and a countdown clock. And then the whole thing crashed. </p> <p>With that kind of organisation we'll all be heading to Murdersville in 2006 - after all, there's a limit to the amount of people Bobby Charlton can dazzle with his shiny head. So the Fiver has decided to do its bit. There's got to be somebody, somewhere who is willing to do something for (or to) Sepp Blatter to make him change his mind and support our glorious nation.

      "bodyText": "AND THE WINNER (IE: LOSER) IS... Let the Fiver take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London's West End and into the Worst Player of the Season 1999-2000 awards. Look, who are those ruffians hanging around the theatre? Get out of the way Chris Armstrong, you're not invited. Sling your hook John Hartson, you're yesterday's man. Have you no respect, Curtis Fleming? And as for that blind Italian picking at his studs... No, not everyone can get into the WPotS awards - no matter how many rogue votes they receive. Our shortlist contained only five of the poorest, most malingering Premiership players, and you voted for them in your hundreds. In fifth position (which makes him the best worst player of the year) was Dagenham Davor Suker, whose comedy misses against Leicester in the Cup won him a few sympathy votes. And in fourth place was Wim(p) Jonk, derided by Wednesday fans for his lack of commitment, abused by everyone else for his name. This pair can rest easy however, as they fell some way short of our top three. Steffen Freund, with 17% of the vote, romped into third place after mining a large seam of support amongst Tottenham fans. \"I wouldn't have him in my table football side,\" Guy Robbins insisted, while John Hindmarch observed that \"to stand out for badness in this Spurs team is saying something\". Perhaps Peterleic summed it up best when he lamented: \"If only he could have run toward Roy Keane\". Guess we'll never know. In second place came Mickael Silvestre. Like the blue-rinse Tories, you can be assured that the anti-Man Utd vote will mobilise at the slightest prompting and 'Melonhead' Mickael duly reaped 25% of the vote. The most common criticism of the young Frenchman was that he \"makes Jaap Stam / Gary Neville / Phil Neville / David May look good\", although Gordon K Smith was not alone in nominating him for \"pushing Raul onto his good foot in Big Cup\". His Championship medal will be hanging on his neck like an albatross, we're sure. But with 45% of the vote, \u00a310m Chris Sutton is the overwhelming winner of a poll some were surprised even took place, so convinced were they of the outcome. \"The worst buy since President Kennedy's convertible,\" said the nattily-named /I=M/S=Brown/GQ=1/. For JRJ Crump, Chris is \"the only player who makes Andy Booth look like a six-a-season goal machine\", while Craig Allen will never forget the man who \"p*ssed on my mate's bar in Norwich in 1992\". Chris Sutton, you are the Fiver's Worst Player of the Season 1999-2000 and if you are in any way related to a M Sutton of Woldingham, Surrey, then we're afraid he's disowned you. ACROSS THE WATER THIS SUMMER You can now subscribe to the Euro, the Fiver's major-championship-in-a-bottle, by going to our home page and clicking on some box or other on the front page. That way, you'll get a constant flow of updates from the lowlands streaming into your inbox from June 5. You can also send a mail to euro2000-request@footballunlimited.co.uk with 'subscribe' in the subject line. Before you know it - drip, drip, drip... why, it's Euro 2000 news! Oh, if you get a incomprehensible mail back, blame our software. As long as the word 'succeeded' appears on it, everything's fine, me hearties! IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON Sun, sea and sand. Pints, powders and prostitutes. But while most football players are already planning their summer holidays, there's still a job to be done this Sunday for some Premiership teams. Bradford and Wimbledon will be psyching themselves up to uselessly clump the ball about the pitch in the hope of avoiding relegation, while Leeds and Liverpool will preparing to stylishly grab the final Big Cup place by, er, uselessly clumping the ball about the pitch. No-longer-crazy (and that's official!) Wimbledon have injury problems ahead of their visit to the Dell. They're without broken-leg victim Michael Hughes and are sweating on the state of Kenny Cunningham's groin. But it's not all bad news for Terry Burton because John Hartson, the big lumbering oaf, is serving out a suspension and won't be getting in the way. And at least the Dons have their fate in their own hands (as do Leeds, whose only injury worry for their visit to West Ham concerns captain Lucas Radebe). The same can't be said of Bradford or Liverpool, who will both be scuttling around Valley Parade in a pathetically desperate fashion. The hosts are hoping the slightly-knocked Peter Beagrie and Wayne Jacobs will be fit to start, while Liverpool have wrapped Sander Westerveld and Sami Hyypia in Rick Parry-approved cotton wool until kick-off. The return to the Liverpool ranks of Michael Owen and Dietmar Hamann could give the visitors the edge, but whatever happens here, chances are there'll be tears before bedtime. Now, where did we put that brochure for Torremolinos? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"They meet in a restaurant and write on pieces of paper; that one will get the title, that one will be relegated. I no longer have any confidence in anything or anyone.\" - A low point, shall we say, for a reflective Gheorgie Hagi, who has pledged to fight corruption in the Romanian league. WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD Yes, yes, we hear you. Fifa executive David Will isn't English, as we stated in yesterday's Quote of the Day, he's Scottish. By the way, all your nasty emails made us cry. Happy now? JOIN US! When Fifa head honcho Sepp Blatter was heckled during a particular boozy PFA dinner recently, England's chances of hosting the 2006 World Cup went down quicker than a German striker in the penalty box. But while everybody else was writing off our chances, Martin Peters and Gordon Banks decided to get up off their World Cup-winning backsides and launch www.backthebid.com, an FA-backed website to collect messages of support for England's bid. Jolly good show, the Fiver thought - and we gaily logged on to express our good wishes. But when we saw the spaced-out video intro and the bogey-green background - surely Banksy's only got one gammy eye? - we started to have serious doubts. Those doubts escalated when we realised the content consisted of a solitary speech bubble proclaiming: \"England hasn't hosted Fifa's World Cup since 1966, the last time we won!\" and a countdown clock. And then the whole thing crashed. With that kind of organisation we'll all be heading to Murdersville in 2006 - after all, there's a limit to the amount of people Bobby Charlton can dazzle with his shiny head. So the Fiver has decided to do its bit. There's got to be somebody, somewhere who is willing to do something for (or to) Sepp Blatter to make him change his mind and support our glorious nation. If such a kind (or debauched) soul exists, contact the Fiver's campaign at debase_yourself_for_england@hotmail.com. Remember - your country needs you! THE RUMOUR MILL Benito Carbone is being tracked by Serie B promotion candidates Napoli, according to reports in La Gazzetta dello Sport. Chelsea defender Frank Leboeuf has admitted he has had contact with Lyon and will end his career with the club. The 33 year-old French international said: \"Contacts have been made between Lyon and myself. Without doubt, they will be the last club in my career.\" Tottenham striker Chris Armstrong is apparently on his way to Leicester in a \u00a33m deal. NEWS IN BRIEF Steven Gerrard, Rio Ferdinand, Kieron Dyer, Richard Wright and Emile Heskey have a good chance of being selected for Kelvin Koogan's provisional 28-man Euro 2000 squad after being omitted from England's squad for the Under-21 European championships. But Frank Lampard is almost certainly ruled out of the senior squad after being selected for the Slovakia tournament. The squad in full: Weaver (Man City), Robinson (Leeds), Thompson (Liverpool), Chadwick (Man Utd), Mills (Leeds), Barry (Aston Villa), Young (Tottenham), King (Tottenham), Carragher (Liverpool), Johnson (Derby), Harley (Chelsea), Lampard (West Ham), Hendrie (Aston Villa), Murphy (Liverpool), Dunn (Blackburn), Carrick (West Ham), Bridges (Leeds), Cort (Wimbledon), Jeffers (Everton), Campbell (Middlesbrough). The Football Trust is to be disbanded and replaced by the Football Foundation. Trust spokesman Philip French explained the objectives of the new body: \"Whereas the Trust's main role became investing in stadia... this new partnership will be to help make money available for grass-roots facilities. It will also differ in that it will seek to target the regions that need funding.\" Rangers have officially taken over Australian National Soccer League club Northern Spirit. Their 51% controlling interest is believed to have cost \u00a31m. Celtic chief executive Allan MacDonald today admitted it will be \"weeks rather than days\" before they appoint a new coach. But he insisted: \"We are now tightening the net and are very satisfied with the quality of the shortlisted candidates.\" Wolves manager Colin Lee has vowed to clear his name after being charged with misconduct by the FA. The charge follows comments allegedly made to referee Kevin Lynch after Lee was ordered from the dug-out in the closing stages of Wolves' 2-1 defeat at Bolton last week. \"I may have been a little aggressive in what I said to him,\" Lee admitted today. \"But that is all and I will not let this rest. The report says that I swore and I didn't.\" TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (5pm) Ee, the stories they could tell you about football.

What am I talking about? The number 2, of course. According to the ancient art of numerology, these are the qualities 2 embodies. Aficionados use numbers to guide them through life, consulting them on all manner of subjects: when to invest, marry, travel, change jobs. Even, perhaps, which number to wear emblazoned across their chests this spring. </p> <p>Of course, some might say it's going a little far in the pursuit of Ultra Fashion to consult a quack before nipping down the high street for a T-shirt. When shopping for the season's essential accessory - anything with a number on it - going with your own instinct should be enough.

What am I talking about? The number 2, of course. According to the ancient art of numerology, these are the qualities 2 embodies. Aficionados use numbers to guide them through life, consulting them on all manner of subjects: when to invest, marry, travel, change jobs. Even, perhaps, which number to wear emblazoned across their chests this spring. Of course, some might say it's going a little far in the pursuit of Ultra Fashion to consult a quack before nipping down the high street for a T-shirt. When shopping for the season's essential accessory - anything with a number on it - going with your own instinct should be enough.

They're drinking outside their homes less and less, which means it's women drinking out more and more, and propping up the drinks industry's sales.\" </p> <p>Sophie Spence, 32-year-old head of new product development at Whitbread, has a lot of ideas about female drinking. Someone in her position has to have. Over the past five years, the young, style-conscious, affluent, urban woman has become the single most influential customer for British bars and breweries - \"our new holy grail\" as Spence puts it. </p> <p>This woman is earning more money and spending more of it on booze (in 1994 only 23% of women said they visited bars regularly, now 55% do). The problem for the industry is that it has been so male-oriented for so long that it just doesn't understand her very well: until the 90s, most drinks companies thought women so unimportant that they didn't even bother to research the market. The catch-up work now being done should lead to major changes in what we all drink, and where we drink it, over the next few years. </p> <p>The big battle for the female pound (or \u00a32.50) is currently taking place in the chiller cabinet behind the bar. It's between the \"spirit mixers\", chiefly Bacardi Breezer (market leader, now outselling lots of big-name bottled beers), Vodka Source (fastest growing brand, street-style marketing) and Smirnoff Ice (relative newcomer but booming). These are essentially the upmarket versions of the alcopops that helped set off the boom in female drinking a few years ago. Until the age of the alcopop, women drinking in bars tended to be caught between wine (always poor quality), spirits (overpriced) and beer (many didn't like the taste enough). They didn't have the anytime, anyplace, anywhere default choice that men have in the pint-o-lager; the alcopop went some way to filling that gap and when the bad publicity started putting off older drinkers, the Breezers, Moscow Mules and Metzs turned up to help out. </p> <p>That default-choice drink, the female version of the bloke's pint, is the holiest part of the holy grail, Spence says. The problem with inventing it is that men, being simpler creatures, are happy to drink lager on pretty much any social occasion, from lads' night out to quiet night in. Women, on the other hand, have a comparatively vast repertoire of drinks and will choose from it according to their circumstances. Whitbread's research identifies eight drinking behaviour patterns for women (see below). But even though a group will be sharing a pattern, it is still impossible to buy a round for six women as you would for six men. With men, it will as often as not be six lagers; with women, it will be two white wines, a vodka tonic, half a lager, a Source and a Breezer, no, actually, maybe just a wine. </p> <p>The trickiness of all this means drinks companies are looking at other tactics for attracting female custom, the most interesting of which involves \"regendering\". This is the marketing term for the current convergence of male and female taste and consumption; the way women now get tattoos, like football, watch strippers, buy erotic fiction and go on lone holidays, for example, while men learn to use cosmetics, do aerobics, cook and read magazines. As far as the statistics go, women are certainly now drinking more like men: 26% of them drink pints, 33% drink beer and lager, 45% go out drinking to pull. </p> <p>The smart drinks companies, though, are realising that this doesn't mean you should think of them as ladettes. Instead, they are talking of \"gender neutrality\" and the \"CKOne approach\". \"After all,\" says Chris McDonough, marketing controller at Bacardi Breezer producers Westbay, \"40% of Breezer drinkers are male. That's interesting because a lot of the signals the drink sends out - the colour, the packaging - are feminine. I see it as part of a feminisation of drinking, which itself is part of a wider feminisation of society as a whole.\" </p> <p>Spence points out: \"Beer advertising has been deeply sexist in the past, very macho, with women portrayed as one-dimensional stereotypes. But you can't do that any more; why should you ignore the female drinkers? We're launching a new draught lager in the autumn, called GB, and we have commissioned non-sexist advertising for it. It's not about being explicitly pro-women; it's just a question of not alienating them. The important thing to realise about these changes is that they aren't about girls acting like blokes; it's about girls being able to do some of the things blokes do without compromising their femininity.\" </p> <p>Well, as they say, we'll drink to that one. The growing influence of female drinkers has already registered favourably in the look of our cities' bars and pubs (style bars, flowers and cosmetics in the loos, bigger windows, better food, use of aspirant male models as bar staff), and the next developments in drinks and how they are sold to us is guaranteed to be interesting. And, of course, reasonably enjoyable to research. </p> <p><strong> Make mine a...</strong></p> <p>Spirit mixers are the big guns in the battle for women drinkers' money. Top names are Bacardi Breezer, Vodka Source and Smirnoff Ice. Meanwhile the following drinking patterns have been identified in women: </p> <p><strong>1</strong> Being (vegging out, basically, goes with gin and tonic) </p> <p><strong>2</strong> Bonding (girlie gossip, shared bottle of wine, bottled lager) </p> <p><strong>3</strong> Shepherding (having to behave yourself, half pint of lager) </p> <p><strong>4</strong> Indulging (obvious enough, Baileys, wine) </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Minxing (don't tell your mother, power drinking, cocktails, pints) </p> <p><strong>6</strong> Princessing (out on a first date, glass of wine, single spirits) </p> <p><strong>7</strong> Bloking (as in acting like one, draught lager, doubles) </p> <p><strong>8</strong> Hunting (ie pulling, spirit mixer, cocktails)</p>",

I see it as part of a feminisation of drinking, which itself is part of a wider feminisation of society as a whole.\" Spence points out: \"Beer advertising has been deeply sexist in the past, very macho, with women portrayed as one-dimensional stereotypes. But you can't do that any more; why should you ignore the female drinkers? We're launching a new draught lager in the autumn, called GB, and we have commissioned non-sexist advertising for it. It's not about being explicitly pro-women; it's just a question of not alienating them. The important thing to realise about these changes is that they aren't about girls acting like blokes; it's about girls being able to do some of the things blokes do without compromising their femininity.\" Well, as they say, we'll drink to that one. The growing influence of female drinkers has already registered favourably in the look of our cities' bars and pubs (style bars, flowers and cosmetics in the loos, bigger windows, better food, use of aspirant male models as bar staff), and the next developments in drinks and how they are sold to us is guaranteed to be interesting. And, of course, reasonably enjoyable to research. Make mine a... Spirit mixers are the big guns in the battle for women drinkers' money. Top names are Bacardi Breezer, Vodka Source and Smirnoff Ice. Meanwhile the following drinking patterns have been identified in women: 1 Being (vegging out, basically, goes with gin and tonic) 2 Bonding (girlie gossip, shared bottle of wine, bottled lager) 3 Shepherding (having to behave yourself, half pint of lager) 4 Indulging (obvious enough, Baileys, wine) 5 Minxing (don't tell your mother, power drinking, cocktails, pints) 6 Princessing (out on a first date, glass of wine, single spirits) 7 Bloking (as in acting like one, draught lager, doubles) 8 Hunting (ie pulling, spirit mixer, cocktails)",

The pair of them are fine-tuning the recital programme they're due to give in two nights' time of French songs written for the mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori. Upshaw claims she doesn't speak much French, though you wouldn't guess it from the way she's navigating Ravel's supple phrases. </p> <p>With Ducros, Upshaw carefully massages rhythms and cadences until she's sure that accompaniment and vocal line are in perfect balance. You can tell from her body language how close she feels she is to getting it right. The better it gets, the more she jabs her arms and hops up and down on the spot. Occasionally, Ducros - who is French - quietly ventures a suggestion about some nuance of diction. \"Ah, so you are mocking my French accent,\" Upshaw sighs, shaking her head in bogus lamentation. </p> <p>This kind of intimate, exploratory music-making is very much Upshaw's style. The programme of French music is one of the less daunting projects currently on her plate, since she has already performed it in Europe and recorded chunks of it on the live album, Hommage \u00e0 Jane Bathori. Meanwhile, she has been working up a collection of Broadway songs called Round About to perform at New York's John Jay College Theatre, and preparing to go on tour with the Kronos Quartet with a selection of multi-ethnic pieces collectively entitled Tonight Is the Night. After that, Upshaw will spend the summer flitting round Europe performing works by George Crumb, Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho. </p> <p>So do Upshaw's multiple musical personalities baffle her listeners? \"I do sense that people don't know what to do with me sometimes,\" she says. \"Sometimes I get people in the audience who wish they were at something else, like, 'Well, I didn't think she was gonna do this!' If I ever felt my range was so confusing to people that it affected my ability to get work or have an audience, I would maybe think about it more.\" </p> <p>It is Upshaw's willingness to intersperse the familiar with the unknown that has earned her a unique cachet among international singers. Most big-ticket performers know their place, whether it be classical, baroque or grand opera. Upshaw, meanwhile, enjoys freakish popular success as the soprano on Gorecki's lugubrious Third Symphony one moment, and the next she's at Glyndebourne, flashing back 300 years to Handel's Theodora. As Peter Sellars, who directed her in Theodora, puts it: \"Her restlessness, her self-doubt, her lack of self-satisfaction, her risk-taking keep her constantly moving forward.\" </p> <p>Her career may be an illuminating example of the way ambitions and expectations can differ on either side of the Atlantic. If Upshaw had been trained in Britain or Germany, her m\u00e9tier would probably have been the classical lieder repertoire, with a smattering of 20th-century music for variety. But having been born in Nashville, then raised in the Chicago suburb of Park Forest, Upshaw was exposed to a different set of circumstances. Classical music was by no means the earliest influence on her. </p> <p>\"My parents were great music lovers, and there was music being played almost all the time. But the closest I got to classical music was hearing The Swingle Singers Sing Bach. Otherwise I was interested in music theatre, and so were my parents, We were involved in a community drama group.\" </p> <p>And wasn't she a member of the Upshaw Family Singers, too? \"Oh dear,\" she mutters. \"Before they got involved in the drama group, my parents were quite active politically in the community. This was during the civil rights movement in the 60s. They both had nice voices and my dad plays the guitar, so they had this idea of the family singing for children in schools. It was all civil rights music, so we were hopefully bringing this important message to children, if they hadn't gotten it at home already.\" </p> <p>When she went to junior high school, Dawn Upshaw, social crusader, began to develop a more single-minded musical direction: \"All I wanted to do when I got home was go into my room and sing.\" </p> <p>It was only when she moved up to high school that she found a teacher who made a point of encouraging her obvious abilities. \"It's probably a typical story. A teacher says, 'Let me help you take this more seriously.' Then I went to college thinking I would get a music degree and then hopefully sing on Broadway, but through the music I had to study, I became more interested in classical music.\" </p> <p>She considers herself fortunate that her teachers stressed the importance of striking a balance between new and historical music. \"Nobody made a big deal out of it at the time. It seemed kind of natural that, in order to appreciate music from several hundred years ago, we might learn something from what's written today. I'm thankful for that. Sometimes I'm asked, 'How did you get interested in contemporary music?' Well, it was just a natural part of it.\" </p> <p>American and proud of it, Upshaw doesn't hesitate to promote the virtues of singing in one's native tongue. \"In the States, a lot of students go through college as voice majors and only sing in their own language 10% of the time,\" she points out. \"That seems ridiculous to me. It makes more sense to start with what you know and then add to it.

If Kronos had a permanent vacancy for a go-anywhere, try-anything soprano, she'd be tempted to apply. \"When I'm with them, there's just something so right about presenting music of your own time and committing yourself to that. I just feel good about the world when I'm with Kronos. I think there's hope for humanity and there's hope for music.\" Upshaw bursts out laughing at her own hyperbole. \"They're devoted to whatever they play, and that's not so far from how I feel myself.

Although most reviewers commented on the film's failure to sustain what is essentially a 5-minute sketch idea in a 90-minute feature film, an insider told the magazine: \"We always thought there might be more scope from these two characters than just one film.\" But he added that Enfield, who co-wrote and co-produced the movie, would not consider a sequel until he sees how well his film fares in the US. The last British TV comedy show to be turned into a feature film - Rowan Atkinson's Bean - turned out to be very much to American taste; whether our oldest and most truculent teenagers will tickle America's collective funny bone is less certain.",

It also pointed up politicians' hypocrisy towards immigrants and asylum seekers, who were \"being used and abused\" for cheap labour on both sides of the Atlantic and treated as if they were \"a blot on the environment\".</p> <p>\"We have governments like Mr Blair's who talk only about the flexibility of labour, who claim to be on the left but are actually continuing the policies of the right, which are all about the rights of the employer. The social, living wage is under attack, and the people who are masterminding this are the people who got to power on the back of a workers' movement which they now want to change.\"</p> <p>Loach said the home secretary was contributing to the hysteria over asylum seekers. \"Sometimes Straw lets the mask slip, like after that hijack when he said he would send those Afghans back as quickly as possible.

      "bodyText": "The director Ken Loach last night launched a blistering attack on the government for \"playing to the rightwing gallery\" over asylum seekers. Loach, the only British film-maker in the main competition at Cannes, branded the home secretary, Jack Straw, \"repressive\" and warned that New Labour's anti-immigrant rhetoric was in danger of becoming \"a rallying cry for the far right\". His film Bread and Roses, which premiered at the film festival last night, tells how illegal immigrants working as cleaners in Los Angeles overcame their exploitative employers and union racism by organising themselves. Loach said working on the film, his first in America, brought home to him how Tony Blair was \"throwing away\" workers' rights won after more than a century of struggle. It also pointed up politicians' hypocrisy towards immigrants and asylum seekers, who were \"being used and abused\" for cheap labour on both sides of the Atlantic and treated as if they were \"a blot on the environment\". \"We have governments like Mr Blair's who talk only about the flexibility of labour, who claim to be on the left but are actually continuing the policies of the right, which are all about the rights of the employer. The social, living wage is under attack, and the people who are masterminding this are the people who got to power on the back of a workers' movement which they now want to change.\" Loach said the home secretary was contributing to the hysteria over asylum seekers. \"Sometimes Straw lets the mask slip, like after that hijack when he said he would send those Afghans back as quickly as possible. His instincts are quite repressive; he plays to the rightwing gallery. \"We have got to keep reminding ourselves that these refugees have come here for a reason. They are not coming for a holiday; it is often because they have been put through some terribly tragedy or hardship or worse. We should be showing them some solidarity, not this.\" Loach, director of Kes, Land and Freedom and My Name is Joe, which won a best actor award for Peter Mullan, has never been afraid of taking on controversial subjects or imbuing his work with his politics. Bread and Roses, which was turned down for a national lottery grant, has been warmly received by critics, but some American critics were uneasy about the film, which makes no bones about how Hollywood's lavish standards of living are built on the poverty wages paid to the mostly Latino illegal immigrants, who clean offices, look after children and work in the fields and factories. A drama was unfolding at the festival around the Iranian director Samira Makhmalbaf, who, barely out of her teens, is the youngest director ever chosen to take part in the main competition, with her film The Blackboard. She shot it in the mountains of Kurdistan without government permission, and her Italian producers smuggled it out. Like The Apple, which she shot when she was 17, her new film is a subtle allegory rather than overtly political, following two itinerant teachers through a desert landscape on the Iraqi border. Also like The Apple, it has been rapturously received. The producer, Marco Muller, said he wanted to take no risks with officials in Tehran. But he stressed that neither Makhmalbaf nor her father, the director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, had anything to do with the cloak and dagger operation. \"It had to be our responsibility. We want them to continue making films in Iran.\" Although Makhmalbaf denied that she had ever been censored, it is widely known that religious officials vet all work there.

      "bodyText": "The education secretary, David Blunkett, last night attacked hardline leftwingers, including teachers, who \"sneered\" at the government's attempts to create a better educated society. Defending Labour's education reforms, he criticised people who refused to recognise the need for change: those on the right who clung to \"elitism\" and those on the left preaching \"egalitarianism\". In his Rivington lecture to teachers and educationalists in Bolton, Lancashire, he emphasised the need to move on from the old fashioned view of education which involved equipping an elite with basic skills to prepare them for apprenticeships or office work. Times had moved on, and now every youngster had the right to expect a top quality education to enable them to participate in \"a dynamic economic and social force\". \"The more I tackle the basic inequality of opportunity and the preparation for the future, the more I am criticised by the old right clinging to the elitism, on the one hand, and the pretence of egalitarianism from the left, on the other\". But it was the attitude of the latter that he found the most worrying: \"They preach equality of opportunity but then cling on to shibboleths which actually deny diversity, underplay excellence, pour cold water on aspiration and expectation, and accept a dreary, miserably mediocre sameness which has trapped too many children in the most disadvantaged areas.\" Sources close to Mr Blunkett made it clear that this reference was mainly to hard left factions such as the militant members of the National Union of Teachers who staged a walkout during a speech by the school standards minister, Estelle Morris, at its annual conference at Easter. But other leftwing Labour figures, who include prominent politicians such as the former deputy leader Lord Hattersley, have been fiercely critical of the party's policies on selection and grammar schools. \"They are accompanied by the British disease - cynical sneering,\" said Mr Blunkett. \"In education this means that anything short of pouring vast sums of money into the system and leaving it alone is considered to be either interference or some sort of counter-reaction.\" The basics of education - literacy and numeracy - were being addressed through measures such as the compulsory daily maths lesson and literacy hour in primary schools. \"Acquiring a literate, numerate population is the first prerequisite to something else,\" he said. \"The something else is a creative, innovative and dynamic economic and social force, in which men and women can cope with rapid change, and in which they feel, and are, included in the community and society. \"That is why we have begun the task of transforming secondary as well as primary education, and why we are investing in information and communications technology.\" Details of what ministers think children should learn between the age of three and completion of the reception year in primary school were published yesterday in guidance to people working in 35,000 nurseries, playgroups, childminder networks and schools. The employment and equal opportunities minister, Margaret Hodge, said the document, Foundation Stage and Early Learning Goals, aimed to encourage a love of learning. \"Whatever the child's background and wherever they experience their early years' education, this new framework will ensure the best start for every child.\"",

Could our Bestie really have suffered an existential crisis as he knocked in six against Northampton? OK, he leans against the post in my George Best video and looks a bit knackered, but giving a primal scream as he blocks out the world? Leave that to the City fans.</p> <p>Trouble is, we can't suspend disbelief for football: we've seen the grainy footage a hundred times, we analyse the moves on the telly constantly and we know all too well what a footballer in action looks like. I thought John Lynch portayed Best admirably as an alcoholic. But then I don't watch Gary Lineker introducing \"Impending Liver Failure of the Day\" every Saturday.</p> <p>To be fair, it's probably not the worst football movie ever made - Sean Bean in When Saturday Comes retains that crown - and there are laughs to be had, namely seeing Jerome Flynn in an evolving Bobby Charlton wig. And it's not just the action on the pitch that lets it down.</p> <p>The dialogue flutters between footy banter and sudden Shakespearean moments. So they had the late Ian Bannen playing Sir Matt Busby. But it's still hard to credit that United bosses were giving pre-Agincourt style team-talks just 10 years before Ron Atkinson with his \"early doors\" defined manager-speak for an entire generation. </p> <p>In a biopic that pins itself so firmly to United's ups and downs rather than developing any substantial plot, the audience shouldn't be fobbed off with vague claims of artistic licence. If directors want to make football films - and only the hardcore footy fan would sit through one - credibility is key.</p> <p>In terms of portraying on-pitch action, only the absurd Escape to Victory comes close to succeeding, by the cunning device of employing professional footballers to do the actual kicking. In time-honoured playground tradition, the crap footballer - Sly Stallone - is forced to play in goal. Now that's realism.</p>",

I thought John Lynch portayed Best admirably as an alcoholic. But then I don't watch Gary Lineker introducing \"Impending Liver Failure of the Day\" every Saturday. To be fair, it's probably not the worst football movie ever made - Sean Bean in When Saturday Comes retains that crown - and there are laughs to be had, namely seeing Jerome Flynn in an evolving Bobby Charlton wig. And it's not just the action on the pitch that lets it down. The dialogue flutters between footy banter and sudden Shakespearean moments. So they had the late Ian Bannen playing Sir Matt Busby. But it's still hard to credit that United bosses were giving pre-Agincourt style team-talks just 10 years before Ron Atkinson with his \"early doors\" defined manager-speak for an entire generation. In a biopic that pins itself so firmly to United's ups and downs rather than developing any substantial plot, the audience shouldn't be fobbed off with vague claims of artistic licence. If directors want to make football films - and only the hardcore footy fan would sit through one - credibility is key. In terms of portraying on-pitch action, only the absurd Escape to Victory comes close to succeeding, by the cunning device of employing professional footballers to do the actual kicking. In time-honoured playground tradition, the crap footballer - Sly Stallone - is forced to play in goal. Now that's realism.",

England's leading Test runmaker makes his TMS home debut in the second Test against Zimbabwe on June 1, and has also been picked as a summariser for two of the West Indies Tests. </p> <p> The producer, Peter Baxter, explains: \"I don't want to denigrate our existing summarisers - Vic Marks, Mike Selvey and Graeme Fowler, who are all very good - but we felt we had a little bit of a hole. We hadn't got a great player.\" </p> <p> Mike Atherton, who impressed behind the microphone last season, could also come into the picture if he loses his England place.</p> <p> The fresh look, as Baxter calls it, follows TMS's near-death experience in the winter. The BBC nearly lost the rights to home internationals for 2001-2005 to a much higher bid from TalkSport, and clung on only because the new director-general Greg Dyke promised to use 5 Live and Radio 1 to promote the game more widely. </p> <p> Baxter has signed up two run-of-play commentators in their mid-thirties. Simon Mann, a well-known voice on 5 Live who has commentated for TMS overseas, and Jon Champion, familiar to viewers of Match of the Day, have a Zimbabwe Test each. Inevitably, Champion has already been christened \"Champers\". </p> <p> The programme will at last have a regular female voice, as the youthful Eleanor Oldroyd fills the new role of roving reporter. She will not be alone: Donna Symmonds from Barbados returns to commentate on four West Indies Tests, and the deposed England women's captain, <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,218970,00.html\">Karen Smithies</a> - who made a somewhat nervous debut at this week's B&amp;H quarter-final at Headingley - gets two one-day internationals.</p> <p> \"The number of debuts,\" Baxter says proudly, \"is embarrassing.\"</p> <p> He has another novelty up his sleeve for the Zimbabwe Tests: a summariser assessing the side he's responsible for. Andy Pycroft made it clear when he was asked to step in as the tourists' acting coach that he would only do so if he was allowed to honour his media commitments. So he will be dashing between the dressing-room and the TMS box.

At one stage he was in such a bad way that Warwickshire gave him a fortnight off work.</p> <p> In his updated autobiography, White Lightning (CollinsWillow, \u00a36.99, May 15), Donald details how he blamed himself for the running mix-up with Lance Klusener that left the semi-final tied and let Australia go through on run rate. He confesses: \"It looked terrible - amateurish, panicky, the sort of thing you see on the village green every Sunday...I had blown it.\"</p> <p> When he returned to Edgbaston as Warwickshire's overseas player, Donald was soon injured, and found himself at home, endlessly replaying the video of the run-out. \"I watched the tape over and over again,\" he writes. \"Bob Cottam, our bowling coach at Edgbaston, said to me one day, 'Al - you look terrible. You need some time off.' It's true that I was emotionally drained, and very tired. I wasn't sleeping very well, my mind still pored over that daft moment.\"</p> <p> Donald - currently out of action again with two broken ribs - concludes: \"It took me at least four months to get that match out of my system. Having worn out that videotape, I never want to watch that run-out ever again.\"</p> <p> <strong>Pollock marries beauty queen</strong></p> <p> THE DEEP gloom which descended on South African cricket with the Cronje scandal lifted briefly last Saturday when the country's new captain, Shaun Pollock, married his long-standing girlfriend. Tricia Lauderdale is a name in her own right. Once a beauty queen, she reached the finals of the 1993 Miss South Africa pageant.</p> <p> An informal church ceremony was followed by a reception at a Durban country club, and the occasion was described by one South African newspaper as \"one of the society weddings of the year\". </p> <p> Pollock's team-mates Jonty Rhodes, Mark Boucher and Nantie Hayward were all there, along with South Africa coach Graham Ford, former West Indies all-rounder Eldine Baptiste and the bridegroom's uncle, Graeme Pollock. Shaun's father Peter, another leading former player and until recently chairman of selectors, read a prayer blessing the union.</p> <p> \"Shaun was a perfect bridegroom,\" says one of the 150 guests. \"He and his bride were both very lively, bubbly and excited. And there was an unusually respectful atmosphere. It was very private, too.\" </p> <p> Hansie Cronje, to whom Pollock dedicated the team's recent victory over Australia, was sent an invitation, but declined, pleading a \"long-standing prior engagement\".</p> <p> Mr and Mrs Pollock are now on honeymoon in Mauritius. This weekend it's the turn of Lance Klusener, who will marry Isabelle Potgieter, also in Durban. \"I am more afraid of my wedding day,\" Klusener said recently, \"than of every fast bowler in the world who has ever played against me.\"</p> <p> <strong>Slater signs for C4</strong></p> <p> MICHAEL SLATER, who had a thin time with Derbyshire last year, is returning to take up a rather more glamorous job.

Or one of his many demolitions of Lillee and Thomson?</p> <p> In fact, it's none of the above. As Richards finally reveals in his impressive new autobiography, his most treasured performance is one which reflects his disdain for statistics - a largely forgotten 61 in the first Test against India at Kingston in 1982-83.</p> <p> Not only did he lead West Indies' improbable pursuit of 172 off what turned out to be 26 overs, despite a broken thumb, but his brilliant assault brought to sudden life a game which had looked a dull draw even late on the final day.</p> <p> Richards explains that he went out to bat \"relishing the freedom\" granted by skipper Clive Lloyd's instruction to \"fire on all cylinders\". In Viv's own phrase, he simply went \"berserk\", hitting four sixes and five fours off 35 balls.</p> <p> Amid frenzied crowd scenes, West Indies won by four wickets with four balls to spare. \"It was a trial and a tribulation to accomplish what we did,\" says Richards in Sir Vivian (Michael Joseph, \u00a316.99, published May 25). \"This to me was what it was all about, not doing it just for you but for the team and for the cause...it could not have been better.\"</p> <p> <strong>Lord's and kings</strong></p> <p> IN CASE you missed it - the programme lasted no longer than a Shoaib Akhtar over - the egalitarian spirit of Caribbean cricket was nicely captured in a recent taster for Channel 4's live coverage of next month's Lord's Test against West Indies. </p> <p> Looking back on his 40 years as a steward at the ground, Jamaican-born Eric Dawson fondly recalled an encounter with Viv Richards and Brian Lara in the nets last season. \"I went up to both of them and said: 'A great pleasure to be amongst the King and the Prince.'

There is no shortage of star quality this season in the overseas department: Aussie Bevan is joined on the circuit by 11 of his countrymen, three Indians and one South African, with a pair of Pakistanis due to arrive after their country's tour of the Caribbean. Batsmen in the Championship's first division will need to have spent the winter revising the art of facing spin: Shane Warne, Anil Kumble and Saqlain Mushtaq are all bringing some flight into the top flight.

Their performances provide a lot of the interest in county cricket. Why should we restrict ourselves to just 18 big names? Let's double the number and double the fun. If each county were permitted two overseas players, the intrigue would be greater. Would the overseas stars form partnerships? Imagine Akhtar and McGrath bowling in tandem trying to break up a stubborn partnership between Justin Langer and Rahul Dravid: that's the way to sell the county game.</p> <p> County cricket exists both to feed the England Test side and to provide a spectacle in its own right. A higher number of quality players on the circuit helps both objectives: talented team-mates can act as tutors (recall how Roger Twose benefited from a season with Brian Lara in 1994); talented opponents provide a stiffer test. Some people say the presence of overseas players makes it harder for young county cricketers to break into the first team. Though the argument has some merit, consider this: of the 18 overseas players over here this season, 11 are batsmen. There are 108 top-six batting slots in county cricket. Doubling the number of overseas players and, for the sake of argument, assuming that the number of batsmen doubles too, that leaves 86 batting spots for home-grown players. That's still more than twice as many as there are in Australian domestic cricket - the country which has produced the best Test team of modern times.</p> <p> This column last week championed Warne's arrival at Hampshire and noted that watching county games there is becoming fashionable. This is also true at Worcester: McGrathmania has caught on in a way that Leatherdalemania never quite did. It will continue to do so while the man himself spits venom, like that he showed against Yorkshire in Sunday's National League match. Bringing youngsters into the game should be a top priority in these times. Granted, McGrath will come back an even better bowler with the Australian touring side next summer, but that price is one worth paying.</p> <p> Allowing more overseas players will also help fill the void that Surrey and Nottinghamshire are finding themselves in now: their Pakistan players (Saqlain Mushtaq and Akhtar) are tied up in the West Indies. The expanding winter international calendar is encroaching more and more into the English summer (on May 18, Tests will be starting in both London and Bridgetown), placing extra demands on Test cricketers. We want counties to bring the best players to these shores - not just the available ones - so increasing the allowance of overseas stars will mean Surrey and Notts are not totally deprived.</p> <p> Two overseas players per county is not a foreign invasion: the lesson of football is to be wary of flooding the game with overseas players at the expense of the home-grown. But their presence is evidently important, and thus restrictions should be loosened. After all, a child will drop a joystick to go to watch Shane Warne bowl.

Allowing more overseas players will also help fill the void that Surrey and Nottinghamshire are finding themselves in now: their Pakistan players (Saqlain Mushtaq and Akhtar) are tied up in the West Indies. The expanding winter international calendar is encroaching more and more into the English summer (on May 18, Tests will be starting in both London and Bridgetown), placing extra demands on Test cricketers. We want counties to bring the best players to these shores - not just the available ones - so increasing the allowance of overseas stars will mean Surrey and Notts are not totally deprived. Two overseas players per county is not a foreign invasion: the lesson of football is to be wary of flooding the game with overseas players at the expense of the home-grown. But their presence is evidently important, and thus restrictions should be loosened. After all, a child will drop a joystick to go to watch Shane Warne bowl. Who can find fault with that? Overseas players, 2000 Derbyshire: Michael Di Venuto (Aus); Durham: Simon Katich (Aus); Essex: Stuart Law (Aus); Glamorgan: Matthew Elliott (Aus); Gloucestershire: Ian Harvey (Aus); Hampshire: Shane Warne (Aus); Kent: Rahul Dravid (Ind); Lancashire: Sourav Ganguly (Ind); Leicestershire: Anil Kumble (Ind); Middlesex: Justin Langer (Aus); Northamptonshire: Matthew Hayden (Aus); Nottinghamshire: Shoaib Akhtar (Pak); Somerset: Jamie Cox (Aus); Surrey: Saqlain Mushtaq (Pak); Sussex: Michael Bevan (Aus); Warwickshire: Allan Donald (SA); Worcestershire: Glenn McGrath (Aus); Yorkshire: Darren Lehmann (Aus). Matthew Hancock was editorial assistant on Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2000. Lawrence Booth returns next week.",

      "body": "<p>Aside from the annual World Poker Championships held in Las Vegas, few competitions string out nerves like the divisional play-offs. The stakes are massive, defeat is devastating, luck is a massive factor and success has more to do with bottle than technique.</p> <p>A big wager on the overall outcome is not recommended but it's still worth having a handy little treble combining the outright winners. Take Bolton, Stoke and Darlington to be grinning wildly and dancing very poorly at the final whistle.</p> <p>The Trotters first have to get past Ipswich, who are on a bit of a downer after seeing Manchester City sneak up on the inside to secure automatic promotion. The East Anglian side are now famous for their play-off yips and can falter again.</p> <p>Sam Allardyce's side are on a nice run of five wins and a draw over their last six league games and have raised their game at Wembley already this season in defeat against Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final. Dean Holdsworth will want to atone for the point-blank gaffe that day which, more accurately struck, should have won it for them and made Wembley a home-from-home for the season. With no fresh injury problems to report, Bolton should be bang on for victory at the weekend.</p> <p>Stoke will be the choice of most form-followers to escape from Division Two.

      "bodyText": "Aside from the annual World Poker Championships held in Las Vegas, few competitions string out nerves like the divisional play-offs. The stakes are massive, defeat is devastating, luck is a massive factor and success has more to do with bottle than technique. A big wager on the overall outcome is not recommended but it's still worth having a handy little treble combining the outright winners. Take Bolton, Stoke and Darlington to be grinning wildly and dancing very poorly at the final whistle. The Trotters first have to get past Ipswich, who are on a bit of a downer after seeing Manchester City sneak up on the inside to secure automatic promotion. The East Anglian side are now famous for their play-off yips and can falter again. Sam Allardyce's side are on a nice run of five wins and a draw over their last six league games and have raised their game at Wembley already this season in defeat against Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final. Dean Holdsworth will want to atone for the point-blank gaffe that day which, more accurately struck, should have won it for them and made Wembley a home-from-home for the season. With no fresh injury problems to report, Bolton should be bang on for victory at the weekend. Stoke will be the choice of most form-followers to escape from Division Two. Before going down to Reading last weekend, they won seven on the bounce. And like Bolton, they have played well at Wembley already this season in taking the Auto Windscreens Shield.

Mr Shepherd said he is due to leave Boo today but will spend a few more days with the firm over the next few weeks to ensure a smooth handover to his successors. At Chello he will be responsible for defining its content strategy and developing its broadband services.",

This year, the festival decided to turn the Palais upside down for two days in preparation for the opening night gala. So, while half the building is cordoned off with red drapes, journalists have been exploring various alternative routes to screening and press boxes, via a labyrinth of back staircases, corridors and service lifts. If only someone had seen fit to explain these routes to the festival staff, most of whom will give you the famous Cannes shrug if you ask directions. </p> <p>As an added distraction, the maintenance people were still at work with power tools all the way through the preview of Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her, which opened the Un Certain Regard section. It couldn't have happened to a more inappropriate film - half the dialogue of Rodrigo Garcia's tender, low-key and extremely quiet portmanteau piece was obscured by loud drilling from behind the screen. The crowd's patience finally broke in a delicate scene in which Holly Hunter's character goes for an abortion. \"This may hurt a little,\" goes the gynaecologist. \"Vreeeee,\" goes the drill. The audience explodes in hysterics. </p> <p>It's a tribute to the film's fine tuning that the film survived, just about. Director and writer Garcia - whose debut first showed at Sundance this year - is the son of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but his narrative style is decidedly different from Papa's, much closer to the fine limning of short story specialists such as Carol Shields or Alice Munro. </p> <p>Despite the title, which promises a goofy high-school dating comedy, this is a collection of five sparingly told, more or less open-ended vignettes about single women in the San Fernando Valley, framed by one woman's unexplained suicide. The detective investigating the case (NYPD Blue's Amy Brenneman) lives with her blind sister (Cameron Diaz), who gets all the dates.</p> <p>A teacher (Kathy Baker) gets to know her neighbour, an acidly witty accountant played by Seinfeld regular Danny Woodburn. Holly Hunter's bank manager has her soul read by a bag lady, then starts a flirtation with one of her male employees. Glenn Close is a doctor caring for her elderly mother, who has her tarot read by Calista Flockhart's mournfully insightful hippie chick, who in turn cares for her dying lover (Valeria Golino). And so it all loops round, though rather more mutedly than, say, that other Valley tale, Magnolia. </p> <p>As the title suggests, this is an investigation into the possibility of ever really knowing people from what you can (or can't) see. What is remarkable about the performances is how little most of them give away on the surface, even while managing to reveal unsounded depths to all these people. The tarot reading scene is a marvel - Garcia holds the camera straight on Glenn Close's unflinching gaze, while Flockhart simply tells her everything about the inner life she can fathom in the cards. We don't know whether she's right, but the very fact that Close's poker face neither confirms nor denies her reading proves she has touched a nerve. </p> <p>The film suffers from being slightly too close to the old-fashioned stereotype of the intelligent independent \"chick flick\", as they say at Sundance, where they go down a storm (producer Jon Avnet directed Fried Green Tomatoes, one of the more mawkish of the genre). Garcia undoubtedly has a dangerously soft touch. Some of his symbols - canaries, a bonsai tree - are awkwardly twee, and he is not immune to touches of farce and sentiment. He certainly makes a bad choice in Edward Shearmur's decorous paper-doyly of a score. Garcia can be witty, though: Diaz, apparently poring over Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus in braille, witters on about realising her emotional potential, before revealing that she's actually reading One Hundred Years of Solitude. </p> <p>Garcia's understated approach to understated emotions depends on a sensitive cast, and there are some surprises here. Hunter and the underrated Baker are the standouts, but Diaz also proves much tougher and smarter than she is often given credit for, wryly jousting with her cop sister. </p> <p>Flockhart isn't quite in the same league, but she's clearly determined to slough off the kooky Ally McBeal image: she performs here with a sort of sotto voce depressiveness, as if she's about to fade into the background, but it's the sort of modest underplaying that could really come alive, given a tougher director. </p> <p>Garcia's intimate suburban storytelling doesn't quite have the hard intelligence of, say, Atom Egoyan's multi-stranders or Todd Haynes's Safe, although the film's clean, sober look suggests he's going that way. At the very least, Things You Can Tell is a weepie with brains and restraint, which is a rare enough distinction.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I read an interesting phrase the other day, conjured up by the American essayist Philip Lopate, who talked of \"the heroic age of moviegoing\" that he grew up with in New York in the 60s. He doesn't mean that he once dressed up in armour and rode a white steed to the cinema with his lady fair. He was referring to a sense of adventure and discovery that used to characterise moviegoing in the pre-video age.</p> <p> I too grew up and became acquainted with the cinema at the tail end of the period he's talking about (he is 20 years older than me) and I share his nostalgia, but my visits to the cinema now seem anything but heroic.</p> <p>Let me tell you about an average visit to the cinema today, in what I've started to think of as \"the villainous age of moviegoing\".</p> <p> I arrive. I buy my ticket. At the concession stand, there are no hot dogs. The girl behind the counter should be in school. Not just because she's the right age, but because she needs to learn mathematics before she tries giving me change from a 20.</p> <p> Then again, I've bought a small Pepsi - perhaps there just isn't any change. In the auditorium, I find I'm early. The PA system is playing prerecorded in-house promo bullshit. (\"Visit our concession stand!\" \"No thank you!\") On the screen is a series of still images with questions about not-very-obscure movie trivia, to which somehow the answer is always An Officer and A Gentleman or Pretty Woman.</p> <p>The questions remain on the screen as long as silent-movie intertitles did back in 1916, when everybody was either a newly landed non-English speaker or just illiterate. Finally the lights go down, and we endure for the millionth time the scratchy old Mann General Theatres logo clip, which has been rolling before every show since Jimmy Carter was president.</p> <p> At last it is trailer time, which often proves more interesting than the movie I've laid down my seven bucks to see. Not today, though. We get the trailer for Frequency, which has been playing for the last three months, one of those ads that tells you the entire plot and ruins the movie for you.</p> <p>A long detailed trailer is always a sign of desperation from a studio that knows the movie in question is an all-time leg-lifting dog - still, it's their way of warning discerning moviegoers to hold on to their money.</p> <p> I adjourn to the gents for a pre-emptive wizz. I find it's wise to go, even if I don't need to. Movies are so long these days that if you don't make the necessary arrangements, micturation-wise, you'll find yourself the sweaty-faced owner of a boiling, lava-filled bladder come the zillion-dollar climax.</p> <p>Returning to the auditorium, I see to my disgust that I've missed most of the Mission Impossible 2 trailer, the only one I did want to see again. I settle for watching the audience for the last few seconds. Their heads are moving violently to catch all the kinetic Woo-isms on the screen, as if they are on a virtual-reality rollercoaster simulator. At least I'm looking forward to one movie this summer.</p> <p>Trailers over, I settle in for the feature. But no, first we must endure... commercials. The LA Times ad always prompts audience hisses, but this time there's another one, for a credit-card company. A horrified woman in the audience utters my own thoughts aloud: \"Oh please, not a fucking credit-card commercial!\"</p> <p> I project myself five years into the future and imagine a time when trailers will be replaced as pre-movie filler by live executions of Visa defaulters on the stage at the foot of the screen. By now I'm screaming inwardly: \"Just gimme the goddamn movie!\" For my sins, they give it to me.</p> <p>Now I despise nostalgia as a rule. By and large, things are much better than they used to be, but I really do miss the good old days of moviegoing, the heroic age that Lopate describes.</p> <p> He's referring to the blizzard of new and old movies that swept across America from the late 50s to the early 70s, thanks largely to new, and still primitive distribution circuits like college campuses and local arts cinemas, of which there used to be at least one in every medium-sized American town (usually it showed art movies till midnight, porno till 2am).</p> <p>The video age killed off both these and the wonderful old midnight movie circuit that offered a place to see pothead movies like El Topo, obscene freak-outs and renegade classics like Eraserhead and Night of the Living Dead. Audiences were raucous and bizarre, and I remember making friends after the shows with just the kinds of freaks and wierdos I'd waited all my life to meet (folks just like me).</p> <p>I'd bump into them again a week later - and 60 miles away - at some obscurely advertised screening that involved a stolen 16mm print of Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life being projected on a bedsheet in a basement. That's the only time I've ever seen Bigger Than Life - it's still one of my favourite movies.</p> <p> I remember watching my first porno movie from the top of a hill (it took us an hour to climb it) overlooking a gigantic drive-in screen outside Asheville in North Carolina. The leading man's erection was the size of Apollo 13. I remember solitary teenage treks to a rat-infested ghetto grindhouse to catch some rotten dubbed martial arts flick, and its polar opposite, a beautiful outdoor cinema in San Diego where I saw Hitchcock's Young and Innocent under the stars.</p> <p> And, finally, I remember driving from northern Virginia to Baltimore - a 100-mile round-trip - one night shortly after I got my driving licence in 1980. It was July 4 and as I rode the Washington Beltway, I saw hundreds of magical fireworks displays.</p> <p>I felt like a newly-minted patriot - and since it was the first time I'd ever driven on a freeway to another city, I also felt, yes, a little \"heroic\" - as I walked to the box-office of Baltimore's beautiful Charles Cinema and said, \"One for Pink Flamingos, please. Midnight show.\" I don't get that same glow any more, and I miss it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I read an interesting phrase the other day, conjured up by the American essayist Philip Lopate, who talked of \"the heroic age of moviegoing\" that he grew up with in New York in the 60s. He doesn't mean that he once dressed up in armour and rode a white steed to the cinema with his lady fair. He was referring to a sense of adventure and discovery that used to characterise moviegoing in the pre-video age. I too grew up and became acquainted with the cinema at the tail end of the period he's talking about (he is 20 years older than me) and I share his nostalgia, but my visits to the cinema now seem anything but heroic. Let me tell you about an average visit to the cinema today, in what I've started to think of as \"the villainous age of moviegoing\". I arrive. I buy my ticket. At the concession stand, there are no hot dogs. The girl behind the counter should be in school. Not just because she's the right age, but because she needs to learn mathematics before she tries giving me change from a 20. Then again, I've bought a small Pepsi - perhaps there just isn't any change. In the auditorium, I find I'm early. The PA system is playing prerecorded in-house promo bullshit. (\"Visit our concession stand!\" \"No thank you!\") On the screen is a series of still images with questions about not-very-obscure movie trivia, to which somehow the answer is always An Officer and A Gentleman or Pretty Woman. The questions remain on the screen as long as silent-movie intertitles did back in 1916, when everybody was either a newly landed non-English speaker or just illiterate. Finally the lights go down, and we endure for the millionth time the scratchy old Mann General Theatres logo clip, which has been rolling before every show since Jimmy Carter was president. At last it is trailer time, which often proves more interesting than the movie I've laid down my seven bucks to see. Not today, though. We get the trailer for Frequency, which has been playing for the last three months, one of those ads that tells you the entire plot and ruins the movie for you. A long detailed trailer is always a sign of desperation from a studio that knows the movie in question is an all-time leg-lifting dog - still, it's their way of warning discerning moviegoers to hold on to their money. I adjourn to the gents for a pre-emptive wizz. I find it's wise to go, even if I don't need to. Movies are so long these days that if you don't make the necessary arrangements, micturation-wise, you'll find yourself the sweaty-faced owner of a boiling, lava-filled bladder come the zillion-dollar climax. Returning to the auditorium, I see to my disgust that I've missed most of the Mission Impossible 2 trailer, the only one I did want to see again. I settle for watching the audience for the last few seconds. Their heads are moving violently to catch all the kinetic Woo-isms on the screen, as if they are on a virtual-reality rollercoaster simulator. At least I'm looking forward to one movie this summer. Trailers over, I settle in for the feature. But no, first we must endure... commercials. The LA Times ad always prompts audience hisses, but this time there's another one, for a credit-card company. A horrified woman in the audience utters my own thoughts aloud: \"Oh please, not a fucking credit-card commercial!\" I project myself five years into the future and imagine a time when trailers will be replaced as pre-movie filler by live executions of Visa defaulters on the stage at the foot of the screen. By now I'm screaming inwardly: \"Just gimme the goddamn movie!\" For my sins, they give it to me. Now I despise nostalgia as a rule. By and large, things are much better than they used to be, but I really do miss the good old days of moviegoing, the heroic age that Lopate describes. He's referring to the blizzard of new and old movies that swept across America from the late 50s to the early 70s, thanks largely to new, and still primitive distribution circuits like college campuses and local arts cinemas, of which there used to be at least one in every medium-sized American town (usually it showed art movies till midnight, porno till 2am). The video age killed off both these and the wonderful old midnight movie circuit that offered a place to see pothead movies like El Topo, obscene freak-outs and renegade classics like Eraserhead and Night of the Living Dead. Audiences were raucous and bizarre, and I remember making friends after the shows with just the kinds of freaks and wierdos I'd waited all my life to meet (folks just like me). I'd bump into them again a week later - and 60 miles away - at some obscurely advertised screening that involved a stolen 16mm print of Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life being projected on a bedsheet in a basement. That's the only time I've ever seen Bigger Than Life - it's still one of my favourite movies. I remember watching my first porno movie from the top of a hill (it took us an hour to climb it) overlooking a gigantic drive-in screen outside Asheville in North Carolina. The leading man's erection was the size of Apollo 13. I remember solitary teenage treks to a rat-infested ghetto grindhouse to catch some rotten dubbed martial arts flick, and its polar opposite, a beautiful outdoor cinema in San Diego where I saw Hitchcock's Young and Innocent under the stars. And, finally, I remember driving from northern Virginia to Baltimore - a 100-mile round-trip - one night shortly after I got my driving licence in 1980. It was July 4 and as I rode the Washington Beltway, I saw hundreds of magical fireworks displays. I felt like a newly-minted patriot - and since it was the first time I'd ever driven on a freeway to another city, I also felt, yes, a little \"heroic\" - as I walked to the box-office of Baltimore's beautiful Charles Cinema and said, \"One for Pink Flamingos, please. Midnight show.\" I don't get that same glow any more, and I miss it.",

Performing my own personal jump-cuts, I start to wonder what I was feeling so self-satisfied about a few minutes earlier, and realise how effortlessly Temple has manipulated my emotions. Presenting his selective overview of 1975, he's cunningly hypnotised me into believing that this would have been my 1975 too - which, of course, it wouldn't, any more than Dale Winton, Kilroy and a cocker spaniel stuck in an airing cupboard in North Yorkshire would represent my 2000. </p> <p>The subtext of The Filth and the Fury is that The Sex Pistols \"had to happen\": the economic, cultural, and musical climate made them a necessity. It's a brilliant, noble film, depicting the band members as individual, self-sufficient timebombs, and countering the \"manufactured yob\" image propounded by ex-manager Malcolm McLaren. But for all its grit and honesty, its portrayal of the Sex Pistols as the saviours of music is, like so many reappraisals of punk, rose-tinted and theatrical.</p> <p>Everything in bell-bottoms is the enemy, washed-up and smug. You could be forgiven for thinking that Yes and Emerson, Lake and Palmer had the charts entirely to themselves, that every popular song featured a 10-minute drum solo, that Bowie, KC And The Sunshine Band, Steely Dan and Black Sabbath weren't all making groundbreaking albums, that black music wasn't enjoying its strongest-ever phase, and that sunshine was yet to be invented. </p> <p>Doesn't Temple think that journalists and film-makers tend to over-idealise punk, that they single out the most bloated offenders of the environment it was unleashed into, in order to delineate it as more of a breath of fresh air than it really was? Apparently not. \"It was all very overblown at that time, lots of long drum solos,\" he says. \"Kilburn and The High Roads were good, and Roxy Music, but there was a sense that the energy had died. Black disco was good, of course, but you couldn't relate to it.\" </p> <p>This is the least insightful thing Temple says to me. Millions of white kids related to black disco's \"live for the weekend, spread the love\" message - not because they were copping out, but because it made their humdrum lives so much more bearable: for one night a week, they were a star. One of punk's most heinous bits of elitism is its tendency to over-romanticise dirt, to imply that if something isn't caked in vomit it's not real or valid. </p> <p>Early on in The Filth and the Fury, Johnny Rotten remembers the anger he would feel walking down Chelsea's King's Road, observing manicured hippies and resenting their escapism, the way they pretended \"the world wasn't happening\". But Steve Jones contradicts him by waxing uncynical about pop stars who seemed like \"they'd fallen from the sky\".</p> <p>By taking reality to extremes, the Sex Pistols became unreal. They were more interesting than the Clash, not merely because they had better songs, but because the Clash looked and played like electricians. The Sex Pistols epitomised the \"dropped from the sky\" effect that Rotten rejected - because they were the first band to hate everything, and few \"real\" people, even if they were being totally honest with themselves, could possibly have so much hate for this many things: hippies, the government, abortion, the songs they covered, themselves... \"You don't write a song like God Save The Queen because you hate the English race,\" says Rotten to Temple today, \"you do it because you love them.\" Pretty obvious in retrospect, perhaps, but would he have admitted the same thing in June 1977?</p> <p>The plan to offend as many people as possible in the space of two years might have served as a tumultuous national wake-up call, but there was nothing particularly down-to-earth about it. The Sex Pistols - gob-loose warlords, perforated alien ragamuffins - were hardly less outlandish than Bowie's space cadet or Alice Cooper's goth avenger, and, to the outside observer at least, they might have seemed no less contrived. Temple showed the film to schoolkids not old enough to have heard of the band, and they thought it was fiction, \"a dark version of Spinal Tap\". </p> <p>Temple's biggest tribute to the band is to reveal that it wasn't all planned. \"I think punk has been over-intellectualised,\" he argues, \"and I hope this film reclaims the Pistols' own street anger as a major source of what they were writing about. They didn't go to situationist school and get indoctrinated with anarchist theory. It was very much the other way around, and it annoys me when people say they were puppets or tabloid yobs.\" </p> <p>There are little beautiful, revelatory cracks and admissions in The Filth and the Fury - Steve Jones' overall humility (his admission that he \"didn't even know who the Prime Minister was at the time\"), Rotten's deep-seated bewilderment that the whole thing could lead to the death of his friend, Sid Vicious as a mummy's boy gone wrong. This wasn't scheming media manipulation but an innocent bunch of working-class lads striving to change the world from their backyard without a \"how-to\" book. It is, all in all, a very human story, but there's still that somewhat dubious propagation of the punk fairy tale: world is rubbish, apathetic and grey; Sex Pistols arrive; quality of life is improved for all concerned. </p> <p>Just what has punk done for the now generation? Temple admits it's a mixture of bad and good: \"Without punk, the Guardian probably wouldn't have a pop section. Then there's London street art, Damien Hirst. There'd be no Virgin Airlines without the Pistols.\" He might have also mentioned Marilyn Manson, Billy Idol, attitude-over-talent bands, Sham 69, Offspring, every mindless no-mark excuse for a singer who ever mistook Rotten's eloquent rage for mindless nihilism, the music business's over-emphasis on everything new and temporary, and pop's current, apparently terminal, lack of glamour. </p> <p>Punk values itself above other, so-called \"empty\" genres (psychedelia, soul, prog) because of its alleged altruism, its concern for more than its own well-being, for the future - but ultimately its triumphs were fleeting: a brief ego boost for society's outcasts, a transient swing towards inspired amateurism and... that's about it. Revolution? Better world? We should think about this more closely. Punk begins: the hedonistic 70s are in full swing. Punk finishes its work: the Conservative 80s are about to begin. </p> <p>It's as preposterous to believe that great anti-establishment music wouldn't have been made without the Sex Pistols as it is to pretend that it hadn't been made before them. For all their continuing resonance, the Sex Pistols' most cataclysmic, if inadvertent, accomplishment was to speed up pop music's decline. Where do you go after Never Mind The Bollocks but into more anarchy and extremism until you lose sight of the fact that there's music to be made and music fans to be made to feel good as well? Plus, if your music happens to be intelligent and subversive on the inside and confrontational and vacuous on the surface, you can always rely on the general public (assisted by Mr Big Corporate Cigar) to swipe the icing off an idea and run with it. </p> <p>Temple struggles to come up with an equivalent to the Sex Pistols today. \"I think there are areas in dance music that are interesting...\" But not thought-provoking? \"No - you could make them more thought-provoking, though.\" He hesitates. \"It's becoming increasingly desperate and hard to come up with something new, especially when your ideas are sold back to you on the Internet the very next day. Big Brother is already here in a sense, and people seem to be welcoming it. For the underground these days you have to dig so much deeper.\"</p> <p>In The Filth and the Fury, Johnny Rotten's final wish is \"that future generations go 'Fuck it, had enough, here's the truth'.\" The Sex Pistols told a simple, momentous truth, but simultaneously might have obliterated the opportunity for a pop group to develop the idea of \"telling it like it is\" with such force ever again.</p>",

Temple showed the film to schoolkids not old enough to have heard of the band, and they thought it was fiction, \"a dark version of Spinal Tap\". Temple's biggest tribute to the band is to reveal that it wasn't all planned. \"I think punk has been over-intellectualised,\" he argues, \"and I hope this film reclaims the Pistols' own street anger as a major source of what they were writing about. They didn't go to situationist school and get indoctrinated with anarchist theory. It was very much the other way around, and it annoys me when people say they were puppets or tabloid yobs.\" There are little beautiful, revelatory cracks and admissions in The Filth and the Fury - Steve Jones' overall humility (his admission that he \"didn't even know who the Prime Minister was at the time\"), Rotten's deep-seated bewilderment that the whole thing could lead to the death of his friend, Sid Vicious as a mummy's boy gone wrong. This wasn't scheming media manipulation but an innocent bunch of working-class lads striving to change the world from their backyard without a \"how-to\" book. It is, all in all, a very human story, but there's still that somewhat dubious propagation of the punk fairy tale: world is rubbish, apathetic and grey; Sex Pistols arrive; quality of life is improved for all concerned. Just what has punk done for the now generation? Temple admits it's a mixture of bad and good: \"Without punk, the Guardian probably wouldn't have a pop section. Then there's London street art, Damien Hirst. There'd be no Virgin Airlines without the Pistols.\" He might have also mentioned Marilyn Manson, Billy Idol, attitude-over-talent bands, Sham 69, Offspring, every mindless no-mark excuse for a singer who ever mistook Rotten's eloquent rage for mindless nihilism, the music business's over-emphasis on everything new and temporary, and pop's current, apparently terminal, lack of glamour. Punk values itself above other, so-called \"empty\" genres (psychedelia, soul, prog) because of its alleged altruism, its concern for more than its own well-being, for the future - but ultimately its triumphs were fleeting: a brief ego boost for society's outcasts, a transient swing towards inspired amateurism and... that's about it. Revolution? Better world? We should think about this more closely. Punk begins: the hedonistic 70s are in full swing. Punk finishes its work: the Conservative 80s are about to begin. It's as preposterous to believe that great anti-establishment music wouldn't have been made without the Sex Pistols as it is to pretend that it hadn't been made before them. For all their continuing resonance, the Sex Pistols' most cataclysmic, if inadvertent, accomplishment was to speed up pop music's decline. Where do you go after Never Mind The Bollocks but into more anarchy and extremism until you lose sight of the fact that there's music to be made and music fans to be made to feel good as well? Plus, if your music happens to be intelligent and subversive on the inside and confrontational and vacuous on the surface, you can always rely on the general public (assisted by Mr Big Corporate Cigar) to swipe the icing off an idea and run with it. Temple struggles to come up with an equivalent to the Sex Pistols today. \"I think there are areas in dance music that are interesting...\" But not thought-provoking? \"No - you could make them more thought-provoking, though.\" He hesitates. \"It's becoming increasingly desperate and hard to come up with something new, especially when your ideas are sold back to you on the Internet the very next day. Big Brother is already here in a sense, and people seem to be welcoming it. For the underground these days you have to dig so much deeper.\" In The Filth and the Fury, Johnny Rotten's final wish is \"that future generations go 'Fuck it, had enough, here's the truth'.\" The Sex Pistols told a simple, momentous truth, but simultaneously might have obliterated the opportunity for a pop group to develop the idea of \"telling it like it is\" with such force ever again.",

      "body": "<p>\"But will it make me go... schizo ?\" It is 1962, or rather it is 1962 viewed from the comfortable perspective of 1978. A puppy-like Tom Hulce asks the question as he's offered his first joint by beatnik college professor Donald Sutherland. In the world on screen, marijuana is all in the future, still as exotic to Hulce as the idea of a man walking on the moon. It is still The Weed With Roots in Hell. To be caught in possession carries the threat of lengthy incarceration. In the uptight, grey-flannel post-Eisenhower era its alleged capacity for rearranging one's preconceptions of the status quo, and its reputation as a first step towards depravity, perversion and mental collapse, are almost terrifying. </p> <p>Sutherland - the stoner tank commander from Kelly's Heroes - replies, \"Quite possibly.\" On the set in 1978 though, and in the world at large, marijuana is part of the national post-Watergate cultural furniture, something most young people are now encountering for the first time in junior high school rather than in college.</p> <p>Its praises are cheerfully sung by Cheech and Chong on record and in their movie debut Up In Smoke, currently doing gangbusters box office with teenagers across America. It is associated with Indian ritual, mystic contemplation and spiritual health, and its sweetly scented dissemination throughout mainstream society in the years since the 60s still give it a strong cultural link with progressive politics, acid rock and groovy domestic arrangements - in short, with the Revolution, man. LSD may open the doors of perception, but pot, with its fewer risks and more manageable buzz, offers a nice long gaze through the catflap. </p> <p>In these comradely, macrobiotic times it has other positive associations. It grows up out of the ground, like those \"Amber waves of grain\" in America The Beautiful. In fact it even grew up out of the ground owned and tilled by George Washington, the republic's most noted cultivator of hemp. The one-dollar bill that bears Farmer George's plump face on the obverse, and a masonic-looking eye-in-a-pyramid symbol in the back, is the source of much gormless stoner speculation, and as Slater the pothead comments in Dazed and Confused (set in 1976), \"the money's like... green, man!\" </p> <p>And the drugs laws have changed a little in the 16 years between the script and the set. Although marijuana is still illegal, the focus of law-enforcement is largely on distribution, with so-called \"personal use\" possession informally treated as a minor misdemeanour. \"Why, out in California,\" cried a mock-outraged Steve Martin on his 1977 album Let's Get Small, \"you can get a ticket for that!\"</p> <p>These days it's more likely to be a one-way ticket to the Big House. Cut to the late 90s, and the marijuana-farming comedy Homegrown, starring Billy Bob Thornton and Hank Azaria. Now there's no peace at all among the potheads. Gone are the days of laid-back amateur backyard growing operations, because these days they won't just confiscate the pot, they'll confiscate your house too (you'll get a roof over your head, though - in prison).</p> <p>Now we are in the thickly forested backwoods of Humboldt County in northern California, where growers protect their secret farms with landmines and AK-47s. Gone are the gaudy, tie-dyed colours of Woodstock and the hippie dream. Here the landscape is as green and treacherous as Vietnam, the hippie nightmare. Welcome to ground zero in the War on Drugs, a social experiment whose tendency to deprave the polity and vandalise a citizen's constitutional rights has been matched only by the moronic disaster that was Prohibition. </p> <p>For the record Tom, the answer is no, it won't make you go schizo, unless you're unbelievably repressed. Amateur scientific studies conducted by users the world over have concluded that pot doesn't lead inevitably to harder things like cocaine and heroin. Quite the opposite, in fact: it leads to much softer things, like beds and beanbag chairs, couches and piles of cushions. The ones who do \"go schizo\" are the government and Hollywood, each of which is usually years out of step with broad-based social attitudes towards drugs, even when they think they're busy reflecting them. </p> <p>During the 60s, the high tide of hippiedom, there was in Hollywood movies as little mention of marijuana as there was of Vietnam. For that we had to wait until Easy Rider. When attention was paid to the drug, the tone was more often hysterical, paranoid and idiotic. If legislators had ever actually tried pot (and inhaled) they would be attempting feverishly to legalise and control it, not just for the tax income, but because it would make a perfect social pacification agent, like the drug Soma in Huxley's Brave New World. </p> <p>Like the lawmakers, moviemakers have for years been all over the place about Mary Jane. The template is a film like Reefer Madness, from 1936, which is so one-dimensional and alarmist in its overstatement that it was revived by college audiences in the late 60s as a comedy best viewed while stoned. Audiences of squinty longhairs and associated freaks cheered every infraction by the golden-haired hero, a straight-A student whose good grade-point average and mean tennis backhand are steadily eroded by his hellish descent into a world of perverts, sex-criminals and wall-eyed tea-heads. First he's consorting with hookers, then he's killing his mates, and the last we see of him he's in terminal catatonic brain-meltdown. </p> <p>Reefer Madness reflected the way marijuana had been demonised by the Hearst newspapers. Hearst was in fact responsible for rechristening this quintessentially American plant, then still known as hemp, with the appropriately alien, and thus inherently suspicious, name of marijuana, unjustly smearing Mexican immigrants and Chicanos in the process. </p> <p>There was a blip in 1948, when Robert Mitchum - never reticent about his semi-criminal youth - walked away in triumph from a potentially career-killing pot-bust and jail sentence. He was almost a star in 1948. In 1950 he was box-office dynamite. But Reefer Madness's ridiculous moral parameters were still intact a decade later in klutzy B-features like High School Confidential, a film we remember now mainly because Jerry Lee Lewis was in it, not because Russ Tamblyn played a teenage undercover agent working to bust a deadly high school pot ring. </p> <p>Of course, you'd think the 60s might have propelled marijuana into the forefront of cinematic consciousness - that it would have turned up in every other movie just as it had already turned up in every other household. Oddly this wasn't the case, even though Hollywood was the most drug-addled place in America after 1965. When pot does rate a positive mention, in movies like Easy Rider, MASH, Richard Rush's Getting Straight or Milos Forman's Taking Off, it seems to have been invoked surreptitiously, an in-joke for the freaks at the expense of The Man, part of the subterranean lingua franca of the youth movement seeping into the uncomprehending straight mainstream. </p> <p>It's more often seen than discussed, as in the single shot in MASH of Marine quarterbacks on the sidelines of the final football game passing a joint (Marines? Quarterbacks? Smoking pot? That was truly subversive in 1970). It appears intermittently in 70s movies in much the same way, Jack Nicholson, a manic spliffologist in his private life, was a note-perfect neophyte pot-smoker in The Last Detail (just as he had in Easy Rider), and director John Milius makes a small personal statement playing a swarthy Mexican pot dealer in his one-word cameo in Big Wednesday (the one word is \"Marijuana!\"). </p> <p> Although pot does show up fairly regularly through the 70s, it is never really at the centre of things. Coke and heroin do make you schizo; thus they offer greater dramatic possibilities for the movies. By the time potheads were appearing regularly in movies it was the 80s, and gone were the associations with grooviness and the positive drug culture that had sanctified weed in the previous 15 years.</p> <p>Now the ur-stoner was Sean Penn's surfer-savant Jeff Spicolli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, a character that has been replicated in more or less every high school comedy since. Spicolli, who orders pizzas to be delivered to his desk in class and gets high between classes in his foetid van, has for too long looked far too deeply into the bong. Cheech and Chong aren't making comedies for Jeff - they're describing his life, like a documentary. His brains are way out there, and they're never coming home. </p> <p>High school movies like The Breakfast Club made the point that pot had unifying qualities. The only thing that prompts any unanimity between the various students in detention is a joint produced by Judd Nelson. For a short while it makes them all friends. This eminently sensible approach to pot was reflected in the wave of revisionist movies about the 60s that began to crest in the mid-80s after Platoon (which recreated the gun-barrel pipe), and even in movies like Withnail and I, which depended for its humour on its retrospective \"what a dumb shit I once was\" point of view and gave the world the Camberwell Carrot. Britain gives us a very different doper movie this month in Saving Grace, in which bankrupt widower Brenda Blethyn turns to hemp cultivation. Saving Grace, which won the audience award at Sundance, also features co-writer Craig Ferguson and Martin Clunes as a dope fiend doc. </p> <p>Typically, Hollywood displayed a fairly non-judgmental new attitude to soft drugs even as Reagan and his 60s-phobic cabinet were legislating all narcotics from A to H back to the margins in the wake of the crack epidemic. As the lawmakers embarked on a new era of prohibition, film-makers were beginning to say, \"Hey, can I try some of that?\" What we have today is an uneasy compromise between finger-wagging and acceptance (plus the tedious hemp-advocacy of Woody Harrelson et al). </p> <p>Stoners are idiots, by and large, at least if you watch enough Pauly Shore movies like BioDome and California Man, but the connotations of criminality and mental collapse have for the most part disappeared. It has also lost most of its progressive ideological baggage, in that it's no longer really considered a tool for aiding perception, but as a reducer of stress, a tool that makes bad television seem good (cf Brad Pitt's angelic stoner in True Romance, whose idea of social engagement is the invitation, \"Wanna watch a li'l TV?\") </p> <p>Hip-hop has celebrated the demon weed for so long that blazin' it is accepted as almost an official part of everyday life - and when Al Gore recently admitted that he'd smoked a lot of pot in college and Vietnam, it barely made the papers. And why should it? Marijuana is the post-60s equivalent of the martinis that the hippie's suburban parents used as a social lubricant. It's everywhere, and it's still illegal. Apparently we're still schizo after all these years.</p> <p>\u0095 Saving Grace opens next Friday.</p>",

I mean, when a Roman sits down and relaxes, what does he unbuckle?\"</p> <p>A very pertinent question. The \"unbuckling\" issue - the micro-imagining of a world routinely conceived in giant terms - is where a film could so easily slip into Python territory and Ridley Scott's richly enjoyable Gladiator, the first proper Roman romp for 40 years, does not quite answer Wyler's query. But it is so entertaining and carried off with such dash and chutzpah, it makes you forgive the odd absurdity and wonder where this genre has been all your life. </p> <p>Between the reign of Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius and his pampered, petulant son Commodus at the end of the second century AD, Scott deftly imagines a doughty soldier, bearing the outrageously virile name of Maximus. He is played by Russell Crowe, processing through a kind of triumphal arch into the A-list arena, grizzled and stubbled and troubled, his lips permanently pursed with suppressed contempt for the sinister and humbug- ridden politicians buzzing around him. </p> <p>Having kicked some Teutonic butt in Germania - the uproarious battle-scene that starts the movie - Maximus is secretly ordered by the ailing emperor Aurelius (Richard Harris) to succeed him, ruling Rome as a kind of Cromwellian Lord Protector. The evil Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is very cross and lisps sandal-stamping lines like: \"I am terribly vexed!\" He promptly murders his father, announces his own succession, and orders Maximus and innocent wife and son to be slain. But Maximus escapes, is sold into slavery, obsessively trains as an awe- inspiring gladiator and returns to Rome in triumph as the darling of the mob to exact a terrible revenge. </p> <p>Throughout it all, Crowe maintains a tough, slot-mouthed reticence; he is very persuasive as the superman of the Colosseum. Maximus is a slave by now of course, and this picture warily allows him one African comrade in the fellowship of chain and shackle. (Maximus is also supposed to hail from Spain, pointedly given his own ethnic identity as \"The Spaniard\"; I had a microsecond reverie of Maximus raising his sword and buckler in the cause of Elian Gonzalez.) </p> <p>He is unmistakably patrician, however, and physically very like Richard Burton, with Burton's battered face and gravel-voiced machismo. But Crowe's Maximus is no Mark Antony; there is no destructive love interest in the picture. Maximus is sweetly devoted to his late wife; though it turns out he once had a bit of an unbuckling thing going in his backstory for Commodus's lovely sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).</p> <p>Among the toga- and tunic-wearing ranks, Derek Jacobi supplies some I Claudius-style classiness as Senator Gracchus, and the late Oliver Reed gives a rather sweet, poignant performance as Proximo, the gladiator trainer who dreams of his own former glories - his presence, like so much in the film, partly computer-generated. David Hemmings, the former exquisite youth, sports two enormous windswept eyebrows as Cassius, the director of the gladiatorial revels. </p> <p>But no hanky-panky here. Scott's movie here effectively endorses the Roman virtue of manly restraint, though here the question that must be asked is: where, oh where is the traditional homoeroticism? The massive hunks of male flesh on display do not have that deeply bronzed, oiled, chicken-basting look of yore, and the pecs lack the mammary fleshiness of a Victor Mature or a Stephen Boyd. And Crowe is certainly not into climbing into any communal male bathing area with his brother officers for some ambiguous small-talk about snails. When Peter Graves asks the little boy in Airplane if he likes movies about gladiators, this surely wasn't what he had in mind. </p> <p>Where Scott really scores is in his big Rome set-pieces, especially Crowe's combat with men and tigers in a computer-enhanced Colosseum much bigger and more monumental than the original. Forty years ago, these great spectacles were intended to lure cinema audiences away from their new television sets,and part of the thrill lay in knowing that those sets and extras were real. Now they have the same effect as the battle set-pieces and crowd scenes in Phantom Menace: impressive in their way, but that epic innocence, for good or ill, is quite gone. To add to this state-of-the-art craftsmanship, however, Scott introduces a technique of a perceptibly earlier vintage: a gimmicky pop-video flashing and flickering when Maximus has to wield his sword and shield around: a kind of battle-strobe effect, which grates a bit. </p> <p>What finally has to be said is that for all its implausible silliness and towering high camp, Scott's movie tells an engaging story, and the central arena fight-sequence in which Maximus and his gladiators playing the doomed Carthaginians end up defeating the Romans and reversing history \"to the emperor's horror\" is wittily and adroitly done: a sly demonstration of the confluence of politics and mass entertainment.

She quoted back Mr Byers's infelicitous phrase of last Tuesday, when he claimed to have \"rolled up his sleeves\" to tackle the Rover crisis. Shouldn't he \"roll up his sleeves\" and cut back business taxes? She used the phrase three times in the session. It was meant to sound full of magisterial contempt. It didn't.</p> <p>The session continued, often interrupted by the Tories' Eric Forth, a ferocious heckler, who was wearing a frog-green tie decorated with huge and sinister pairs of eyes, so it looked as if an alien monster were about to burst out of his chest and go \"boo!\" to Mr Byers.</p> <p>Sometimes a question was answered by Patricia Hewitt, the minister for scary modern technology. But there is something irredeemably old-fashioned about Ms Hewitt. She has a precise, fluting, perfectly modulated Joyce Grenfell kind of voice which makes Mary Poppins sound like Two-Ton Tessie O'Shea.</p> <p>\"George, don't do that!\" you expect her to say, but gently and understandingly. Ms Linda Perham of Ilford is an archetypal apple-polishing Blair babe, always anxious to suck up to the teachers.</p> <p>She asked a \"question\" about reducing the burdens on business. Wasn't it true, she asked in the low but hurried monotone of a child who has committed Wordsworth's Daffodils to memory and is trying to get it all out before she forgets the last line, that the last Tory government had imposed 10,000 more regulations on British industry? (This improbable figure works out at more than four new regulations per parliamentary day for all 18 years.)</p> <p>She continued at a mumbling gallop. \"And would my honourable friend not agree that this government is delivering fairness at work, through the minimum wage, paid holidays...\" To my horror, I saw that Ms Hewitt had swivelled round on the bench and was smiling beatifically up at Ms Perham, while nodding encouragingly, exactly like a teacher whose most backward child is performing for the governors.</p> <p>When Ms Perham had finally got it all out, and sat down in evident relief, the minister rose, smiled again and trilled, \"my honourable friend is absolutely right, and gets a gold star on her exercise book!\" Well, she only said the first six words, but the rest were implied.</p> <p>I sometimes wonder if it's like that in the Labour whips' office, when somebody rebels against the government. Are the naughty MPs summoned to meet Ann Taylor, and told by her, \"the chief whip isn't angry. She is just very, very sad.\"</p>",

The session continued, often interrupted by the Tories' Eric Forth, a ferocious heckler, who was wearing a frog-green tie decorated with huge and sinister pairs of eyes, so it looked as if an alien monster were about to burst out of his chest and go \"boo!\" to Mr Byers. Sometimes a question was answered by Patricia Hewitt, the minister for scary modern technology. But there is something irredeemably old-fashioned about Ms Hewitt. She has a precise, fluting, perfectly modulated Joyce Grenfell kind of voice which makes Mary Poppins sound like Two-Ton Tessie O'Shea. \"George, don't do that!\" you expect her to say, but gently and understandingly. Ms Linda Perham of Ilford is an archetypal apple-polishing Blair babe, always anxious to suck up to the teachers. She asked a \"question\" about reducing the burdens on business. Wasn't it true, she asked in the low but hurried monotone of a child who has committed Wordsworth's Daffodils to memory and is trying to get it all out before she forgets the last line, that the last Tory government had imposed 10,000 more regulations on British industry? (This improbable figure works out at more than four new regulations per parliamentary day for all 18 years.) She continued at a mumbling gallop. \"And would my honourable friend not agree that this government is delivering fairness at work, through the minimum wage, paid holidays...\" To my horror, I saw that Ms Hewitt had swivelled round on the bench and was smiling beatifically up at Ms Perham, while nodding encouragingly, exactly like a teacher whose most backward child is performing for the governors. When Ms Perham had finally got it all out, and sat down in evident relief, the minister rose, smiled again and trilled, \"my honourable friend is absolutely right, and gets a gold star on her exercise book!\" Well, she only said the first six words, but the rest were implied. I sometimes wonder if it's like that in the Labour whips' office, when somebody rebels against the government. Are the naughty MPs summoned to meet Ann Taylor, and told by her, \"the chief whip isn't angry. She is just very, very sad.\"",

It was, after all, one of the founding members of the 123-year-old London Metal Exchange, which this week became the latest London exchange to bow to the forces of demutualisation. </p> <p>So it is all the more appalling that, four years after the Sumitomo scandal, which cost the Japanese conglomerate of that name around \u00a32bn, it has been landed with a \u00a31m fine by the LME. </p> <p>Stripping away the jargon (which has always helped make the metals market impenetrable to outsiders) Wolff has effectively been found guilty of forging invoices over a period of seven years, so helping a super-profitable client (Yasuo Hamanaka, Sumitomo's chief copper trader) cook his books. </p> <p>The LME has already fined two other firms for their role in the Sumitomo affair - Deutsche Sharps Pixley Metals and Merrill Lynch. Yes, that is two banks which are said to number among the finest financial institutions on the planet. And by the account of the best market insiders, three more firms are due to receive swingeing fines. </p> <p>Yet no mention has been made of Winchester Commodities, the provincial copper trader which initially attracted the attention of regulators looking at the copper market in the early 1990s and which was widely assumed to be at the centre of the scandal. </p> <p>The matter should be clarified. Because either Winchester is as guilty as the rest, or the City's financial police (and the LME's own supervisors) spent five years or more looking in the wrong direction. </p> <p><strong> Boo for backers </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.boo.com\">Boo.com</a>, the ever-so enthusiastic online retailer which once promised to be Europe's answer to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a>, may yet secure the rescue finance it so obviously needs to keep going. Whether or not it does, the affair is proving very embarrassing for backers LVMH, Benetton, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who have patently failed to provide the management and advice it has so clearly lacked. Names such as these should know better than anyone that while it is easy to spray money around, successful businesses need careful nurturing - even in the new economy.</p>",

It just shows how many schoolyard bullies get to be top of the class. Not so pukka Rudolf Wolff &amp; Co has long enjoyed what is usually described in the City of London as a pukka reputation. It was, after all, one of the founding members of the 123-year-old London Metal Exchange, which this week became the latest London exchange to bow to the forces of demutualisation. So it is all the more appalling that, four years after the Sumitomo scandal, which cost the Japanese conglomerate of that name around \u00a32bn, it has been landed with a \u00a31m fine by the LME. Stripping away the jargon (which has always helped make the metals market impenetrable to outsiders) Wolff has effectively been found guilty of forging invoices over a period of seven years, so helping a super-profitable client (Yasuo Hamanaka, Sumitomo's chief copper trader) cook his books. The LME has already fined two other firms for their role in the Sumitomo affair - Deutsche Sharps Pixley Metals and Merrill Lynch. Yes, that is two banks which are said to number among the finest financial institutions on the planet. And by the account of the best market insiders, three more firms are due to receive swingeing fines. Yet no mention has been made of Winchester Commodities, the provincial copper trader which initially attracted the attention of regulators looking at the copper market in the early 1990s and which was widely assumed to be at the centre of the scandal. The matter should be clarified. Because either Winchester is as guilty as the rest, or the City's financial police (and the LME's own supervisors) spent five years or more looking in the wrong direction. Boo for backers Boo.com, the ever-so enthusiastic online retailer which once promised to be Europe's answer to Amazon.com, may yet secure the rescue finance it so obviously needs to keep going. Whether or not it does, the affair is proving very embarrassing for backers LVMH, Benetton, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, who have patently failed to provide the management and advice it has so clearly lacked. Names such as these should know better than anyone that while it is easy to spray money around, successful businesses need careful nurturing - even in the new economy.",

The paucity of agave, which must come from a specific province in Mexico to allow tequila to be called tequila, could dent Allied Domecq's prospects for years and possibly cost as much as \u00a38m. For Philip Bowman, the newish chief executive, the problems could not have come at a worse moment. The drinks group was trying to prove its credentials as a spirits company after selling its pubs to Punch Taverns. Its 16% rise in pre-tax interim profits to \u00a3210m announced at the start of the month was driven by a 15% rise in the contribution from its top four brands - Sauza, the tequila now troubled by the agave problem, Beefeater gin, Kahlua and Ballantines. The rise appeared to justify its aim of becoming a leading spirits group. Now it appears that Allied Domecq may not be able to satisfy its shareholders without embarking on an acquisitions spree, and names such as Seagram and Pernod Ricard have been quickly rolling off corporate financiers' tongues. But after the fiasco surrounding its attempts to sell the pubs chain - first to Whitbread and then eventually to Punch - the City will be looking for reassurance that any acquisition can be made to work first time around.",

Buoyed by private opinion poll data which suggests that the Conservatives may finally be closing Labour's huge lead, the Tory leader invoked James Callaghan's mythical response during the 1978-9 winter of discontent - \"Crisis, what crisis?\" - to describe Labour's response to job losses in 2000. \"The government would have us believe that Dagenham, like Longbridge, is just an island of unavoidable job losses in a broad sea of economic good news. \"Unfortunately it is not. For Dagenham is just the latest example of the crisis now afflicting British manufacturing,\" Mr Hague said as Ford prepares to shed 2,000 jobs at its 70-year-old Essex plant. Mr Hague believes that ICM's poll findings - Labour's lead cut to 8%, or from 43% to 35% - vindicate his decision to use populist tactics on law and order and asylum seekers to capture public attention before last week's elections in which the Tories won 600 council seats. Speaking to a City audience at Lambeth palace last night the Tory leader claimed to be \"speaking again for the mainstream majority of the British people\" with \"common sense alternatives\" to Labour's policies on health, education and transport as well. Michael Portillo, his shadow chancellor, will also aim at the new Tory target - manufacturing problems - in a speech in Glasgow tonight, billed as an attack on Gordon Brown's still-formidable reputation. Mr Hague argued last night: \"Across Britain, manufacturing businesses are struggling, exporters are hit, investment is threatened, profit margins are shrinking and disappearing.\" He blamed policies Mr Brown is responsible for - taxes and \"red tape\" and said that cutting both is the only way to compete with the US and Asia on equal terms. Ministers dispute the Tory claim that they have imposed a \u00a310bn burden of regulation on business since 1997, though the \u00a35bn of higher taxes is harder to deny. In a further twist to the economic debate yesterday, Giles Radice, Labour chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, argued that Labour should declare its intention to join the eurozone soon after the coming election. Britain will face economic and political costs if it stays out, the MP, who is also chairman of the European Movement, predicts in a new pamphlet. \"Polls show that the voters' hostility is more pragmatic than ideological and could be converted to support if they thought that joining the euro was both in their and their nation's interest.\"",

The cabinet is divided over the issue, but Mr Murphy's remarks indicate that the position of the anti-reform camp has been strengthened by the difficulties over devolution. His remarks will be welcomed by opponents of electoral reform, who include the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. The two camps are gearing up for a battle over PR at this year's Labour party conference, although there is speculation that Blairites will shelve the issue to avoid an embarrassing defeat for supporters of reform. Mr Murphy's admission of the damage inflicted by the Alun Michael affair demonstrates that ministers are working hard to learn the lessons from the government's cack-handed approach to devolution. Today the popular Rhodri Morgan, who replaced Mr Michael as the leader of Labour's minority administration in Wales, is the toast of Downing Street, despite Tony Blair's campaign to deny him the leadership of the party in Wales. Labour took a devastating pounding in last year's Welsh assembly elections, losing seats in its heartland areas of the South Wales valleys, as voters registered their disgust with the way in which Mr Michael was imposed as leader. Labour strategists hope that the combination of Mr Morgan, a popular footsoldier, and Mr Murphy, a Blair favourite with more street credibility than Mr Michael, will restore the party's fortunes. A coal miner's son, whose London office is decorated with a portrait of miners drawn with coal, Mr Murphy has been one of the government's most impressive performers. As Mo Mowlam's deputy in Northern Ireland, he played a crucial role in the negotiations running up to the Good Friday agreement. However, the new Morgan- Murphy double act has not led to an easier ride for Labour in the assembly where opposition parties have found yet more ammunition with which to attack the hapless agriculture secretary, Christine Gwyther. In scenes worthy of a Whitehall farce, assembly members were told this week that they were powerless to keep Wales a GM free zone - as they have voted to do - after it emerged that farm-scale trials of a genetically modified form of forage maize were taking place in a field in Flintshire, north east Wales. Ms Gwyther was caught on the hop, believing that officials in London were trying to persuade the farmer in question to sow the crop in a field across the border in neighbouring Cheshire. Amid stormy scenes in the assembly chamber she made clear her unhappiness, but insisted that neither the assembly nor the UK government had the power to block the trial because the crop had consent under an EU directive. Plaid Cymru's business manager, Ieuan Wyn Jones, acknowledges that relationships have become easier now that Labour is under the more relaxed leadership style of Mr Morgan. But he says it remains to be seen whether the new first secretary is willing to show a change in policy direction. Signs of the previous tensions were in evidence again this week amid mounting concern over the fate of the Llanwern and Port Talbot steelworks, two of Wales's biggest manufacturing employers.

He tends to work about four hours a day on his holidays.\"</p> <p>Quite why the government is going full steam ahead on this case is unclear, to say nothing of mad. Ms Booth, representing the TUC, will make a case that now looks almost unlosable. The EU's parental leave directive, which Labour brought in reluctantly and minimally, gives all parents up to 13 weeks off in the first five years of a child's life to cope with illness or crises. Stephen Byers said that he wanted to ensure \"the goodwill of employers is maximised\", so he made it apply only to children born after December 15 1999. At a stroke that eliminated 3m parents' rights.</p> <p>The Irish government tried the same trick but they have just lost a challenge in the European courts: it's an illegal restriction. Labour can expect the same rebuke. But daftly, the case continues, costing taxpayers an arm and a leg so that the Department of Trade and Industry can say to employers that it's not their fault, Europe made them do it. It won't lift the hearts of overworked voters.</p> <p>This was National Work/Life Balance week. It's not made great impact on the news agenda - only a bit more than Lupus Awareness Week which it also is. But it has stirred the expected announcement that there will be a review of maternity and parental rights certain to recommend paid parental leave in time for the next manifesto. It has taken the Blair baby to force the issue, for Labour's record on introducing better working conditions from European directives has hardly been inspiring.</p> <p>The working time directive was a humble thing, uncontroversial everywhere else. Britain alone demanded the right to drive workers beyond 48 hours a week. We work an average 44 hours, to the EU's 40. One in five of us works 50 hours or more: half of managers work most evenings and every other weekend. British stress and unhappiness outstrip that of our neighbours in every EU survey. Labour encouraged this overwork tradition with a special clause allowing workers to \"volunteer\" to work more than 48 hours. Other countries have opt-outs for highly paid posts, but only Britain has 4m workers signing \"voluntary\" waivers to work over 48 hours - many under unsubtle duress.</p> <p>The part-time working directive aims to give all EU part-timers the same pay, promotion and holiday rights as full-time workers. This government, alone in the EU, tried to make most of our 6m part-timers ineligible with a legal loophole: only 45,000 would have benefited. The outcry made them retreat but they've still refused to let part-timers compare their conditions with workers in equivalent jobs (so a care worker can compare her pay and conditions with, say, the gardener working in the same care home).</p> <p>Labour's parental leave law offered only unpaid leave: it will hardly be used. (Other countries pay). It applies only after a year in a job, so single mothers urged back to work wondering if they can hurry home in a crisis will be told yes, of course, but only in a year's time. Britain is good at using small print to destroy the original purpose of a directive.</p> <p>That's a pretty dismal record so far for Labour, overlaid on Britain's already bad working conditions. Our maternity pay is worse, our time off is worse, there is no paternity pay. British governments seem uniquely terrified of employers, at the expense of a workforce measurably the most unhappy in Europe. What do we have to show for it? Nothing at all. We work longer but dumber. Our productivity is among the lowest in the EU, our living standards and per capita income lower than all our main competitors, and their growth rate is higher. Yet our government has the cheek to lecture them on their socialist, dirigiste, unreformed working practices, their crippling unions and doomed future. Even as our factories close, as foreign investors warn they are looking more to France and Germany, we boast about our \"unregulated labour market\" as we drop dead of overwork. It has to stop.</p> <p>The Netherlands this year introduces the universal right to work part-time. All workers can move at will between full and part-time. Most can work four days a week if they wish. (Yes, sensible flexibility has been built in to suit particular employers). Imagine the liberation of knowing that if and when you can afford it, you have that choice without losing status or other rights, choosing hours to suit your life cycle. Meanwhile in France, the 35-hour week which Labour mocked so loudly looks as if it is working well. Unemployment is dropping fast, very few employers are still complaining, productivity and growth are rising steeply in a country far richer than us. Why not?</p> <p>None of the better conditions abroad happened through government exhortation or goodwill from employers - Tony Blair's mantra. Despite these countries' good union-employer cooperation, it has always taken the law to effect change. So all the government's waffle urging employers to do the right thing - Stephen Byers' speech for Work/Life Balance week was a template of this airy nonsense - won't lead to change. If Labour wants a civilised working life for its citizens then it has to face down the whingeing employers (partly by stuffing their mouths with compensation as other countries do). It needs proper wholehearted labour laws, not Labour's legal colanders full of loopholes.</p> <p>This week's announcement of a review of all maternity and parental rights will discuss the vital right for women to return to work part time. The review is bound to recommend paid parental leave, the sum to be kept for the next manifesto. The women running the review - Jay, Hodge, Primarolo and Hollis - are intent on a tough fight, armed with the shocking new figures on how little effect the equal pay act has had on women's incomes. There are five deregulation task forces to cut \"red tape\" round employers' necks. Here's one to stop women being strangled by employers.</p> <p>The next manifesto has to take these women's rights and turn them into a vision for civilising everyone's work. The whole quality-of-life, happiness, work/life agenda is there for the taking, a new vista if Labour is imaginative enough to seize it. In 10 years the country will be at least 30% richer.

Whether motorists used hand-held phones or the hands-free versions, there was a slowing of responses and a substantially increased risk of accident.</p> <p>This was because talking on the phone was inherently more distracting than talking to a passenger in the next seat, rather than because of any effect of the phone as such. But the report called only for their use to be \"discouraged\".</p> <p>Last Christmas, 4m mobile phones were sold, bringing the total in Britain to 25m, one for every two people.</p> <p>But the revolution that their use has brought has been accompanied by a groundswell of worry about possible long-term health hazards, and eruptions of local concern about the siting of radio masts near schools and hospitals.</p> <p>After a series of inconclusive or disputed reports, the national radiological protection board, a government agency, sponsored an independent group of scientists and lay people, chaired by Sir William, a former government chief scientific adviser, to look at all the evidence and all the issues. Yesterday the committee said that it had found no evidence mobiles damaged human health but did raise the spectre of \"subtle biological effects\" which might follow from a mobile phone pressed against an ear.</p> <p>It said the radiation dose from cellphone masts would be hundreds or even thousands of times less than the international guidelines - but for fear of \"indirect\" health risks, an anxiety about possible dangers from the transmitters that could affect wellbeing, the report called for all such masts to be subject to planning restrictions, for there to be an ombudsman to resolve disputes about their siting, and for greater levels of information to be given the general public.</p> <p>Sir William said yesterday: \"I don't want you to go away with the impression, whatever you do, that mobile phones are responsible for ill effects all over the place.\"</p> <p>The committee, which included lay people, an astronomer, radiation experts, neuroscientists and doctors, was not worried about fears that microwaves from mobiles could \"cook\" brains, but they did concede that there could be subtle, unknown effects which might have long-term consequences.</p> <p>One neuroscientist, Colin Blakemore of Oxford, studied more than 300 papers on effects of radio frequency radiation; many were done in Russia under Soviet rule and predated the mobile revolution. \"Frankly, the literature is very muddy and I think it was more politically determined, than determined by the quality of the science,\" he said.</p> <p>\"However, since the 1970s onwards there has been a number of studies in reputable laboratories in the US and Europe, suggesting subtle biological effects.\"</p> <p><b>The risks: Why scientists cannot answer all the questions</b></p> <p><b> Surely all radiation is potentially harmful?</b> In theory. High energy, short wavelength gamma rays and x-rays can burn cells and trigger cancers. Until now, long wavelength, \"microwaves\" used for mobile phone signals have been held to be safe. But mobiles are held closer to the ear, so more radiation penetrates the skull.</p> <p><b> What is the safe level?</b> Nobody knows where the dangers start. \"We know if you go and sit in a microwave oven, you will do yourself a lot of harm, but if you put a mobile phone against your head, we don't know yet whether there is any level of harm at all,\" said one expert yesterday.</p> <p><b> Do mobile phones heat the brain?</b> Yes, at the most by about 0.1C. Sunbathing warms up the brain by 10 times as much. So does jogging.</p> <p><b> Might they damage the brain in some way that won't show up for years?</b> That question cannot be answered finally until millions have used them for many years. The experts want more studies of the workers most at risk, and more studies of the effects of radiation. But at the moment, they don't think so.</p> <p><b> So why are they worried about children?</b> The human brain continues growing and developing after birth, and goes on doing so till puberty. Children's skulls are thinner and heads are smaller, so radiation would go deeper. So the experts say: err on the safe side.</p> <p><b> Why don't they call for a ban on child use?</b> Because there are real risks and merely possible risks. Most people would want a child to be able to call home if lost, or to dial 999 in an emergency.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.iegmp.org.uk/IEGMP-re.htm\" target=\"_new\">IEGMP on setting-up the Stewart report</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,219807,00.html\">The issue explained</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/mobile.htm\">Department of Health: government response to Stewart report</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.fei.org.uk/fei/issues/mobile/\" target=\"_new\">Federation of the Electronics Industry:response to mobile phone health concerns</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nrpb.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">National Radiological Protection Board</a></p>",

Only one group was found to be clearly at risk from mobile phones: drivers. Whether motorists used hand-held phones or the hands-free versions, there was a slowing of responses and a substantially increased risk of accident. This was because talking on the phone was inherently more distracting than talking to a passenger in the next seat, rather than because of any effect of the phone as such. But the report called only for their use to be \"discouraged\". Last Christmas, 4m mobile phones were sold, bringing the total in Britain to 25m, one for every two people. But the revolution that their use has brought has been accompanied by a groundswell of worry about possible long-term health hazards, and eruptions of local concern about the siting of radio masts near schools and hospitals. After a series of inconclusive or disputed reports, the national radiological protection board, a government agency, sponsored an independent group of scientists and lay people, chaired by Sir William, a former government chief scientific adviser, to look at all the evidence and all the issues. Yesterday the committee said that it had found no evidence mobiles damaged human health but did raise the spectre of \"subtle biological effects\" which might follow from a mobile phone pressed against an ear. It said the radiation dose from cellphone masts would be hundreds or even thousands of times less than the international guidelines - but for fear of \"indirect\" health risks, an anxiety about possible dangers from the transmitters that could affect wellbeing, the report called for all such masts to be subject to planning restrictions, for there to be an ombudsman to resolve disputes about their siting, and for greater levels of information to be given the general public. Sir William said yesterday: \"I don't want you to go away with the impression, whatever you do, that mobile phones are responsible for ill effects all over the place.\" The committee, which included lay people, an astronomer, radiation experts, neuroscientists and doctors, was not worried about fears that microwaves from mobiles could \"cook\" brains, but they did concede that there could be subtle, unknown effects which might have long-term consequences. One neuroscientist, Colin Blakemore of Oxford, studied more than 300 papers on effects of radio frequency radiation; many were done in Russia under Soviet rule and predated the mobile revolution. \"Frankly, the literature is very muddy and I think it was more politically determined, than determined by the quality of the science,\" he said. \"However, since the 1970s onwards there has been a number of studies in reputable laboratories in the US and Europe, suggesting subtle biological effects.\" The risks: Why scientists cannot answer all the questions Surely all radiation is potentially harmful? In theory. High energy, short wavelength gamma rays and x-rays can burn cells and trigger cancers. Until now, long wavelength, \"microwaves\" used for mobile phone signals have been held to be safe. But mobiles are held closer to the ear, so more radiation penetrates the skull. What is the safe level? Nobody knows where the dangers start. \"We know if you go and sit in a microwave oven, you will do yourself a lot of harm, but if you put a mobile phone against your head, we don't know yet whether there is any level of harm at all,\" said one expert yesterday. Do mobile phones heat the brain? Yes, at the most by about 0.1C. Sunbathing warms up the brain by 10 times as much. So does jogging. Might they damage the brain in some way that won't show up for years? That question cannot be answered finally until millions have used them for many years. The experts want more studies of the workers most at risk, and more studies of the effects of radiation. But at the moment, they don't think so. So why are they worried about children? The human brain continues growing and developing after birth, and goes on doing so till puberty. Children's skulls are thinner and heads are smaller, so radiation would go deeper. So the experts say: err on the safe side. Why don't they call for a ban on child use? Because there are real risks and merely possible risks. Most people would want a child to be able to call home if lost, or to dial 999 in an emergency.

      "bodyText": "Fourteen redundant nuclear submarines will be cut up and their still radioactive reactors brought ashore for disposal at a site yet to be chosen, the Ministry of Defence announced yesterday. The submarines, including the four boats of the recently retired Polaris fleet which for 28 years provided Britain's nuclear deterrent, have been stored afloat. Seven are tied up at Rosyth in Scotland, another four are at Devonport, and a further three are due to be retired by 2012. By then available dock space will have run out. The original intention of the Conservative government was to dump the submarines at sea but eventually, after international pressure, it accepted the UN's London dumping convention ruling that such a practice was unnacceptable. A site for land disposal is likely to be an already licensed nuclear site, probably Rosyth or Devonport, but it could be Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria or Aldermaston in Berkshire. Since the the first of the nuclear propelled submarines, HMS Dreadnought, was declared redundant in 1982, hunter killer submarines and Polaris types have been tied up one by one. Once the fuel is removed and sent to Sellafield in Cumbria for storage by British Nuclear Fuels, the reactors and hulls are left floating and maintained at the dockside. This costs around \u00a3800,000 a year per submarine. In order to prevent dangerous deterioration, the submarines are dry docked and repaired every 10 years at a cost of \u00a33m and would need a major overhaul after 30 years, adding another \u00a38m each to the bill. Yesterday the defence minister, Lewis Moonie, said that the government had been reviewing what to do with the submarines since 1998 when it became clear that the dock space for old submarines would run out. Once sea dumping had been abandoned the plan had been to leave the boats tied up until a national repository for nuclear waste had been built, but there was no prospect of this happening in time to help the Ministry of Defence out of its space problem. The 800 tonne reactor compartments, which average 32ft by 36ft in size, would be cut out of the centre of the submarines and brought ashore. The ministry has yet to decide whether to cut them up, remove the individual parts and encase them in concrete or leave them in one piece. It has asked industry and anyone else interested to suggest methods of dealing with them. Dr Moonie said: \"Safety remains of paramount importance - we are seeking a safe and practical solution, not a cheap option. We will work to the same standards of safety that apply to the civil nuclear industry.\" Badcock Rosyth Defence Ltd, the company which runs the privatised Rosyth yard, is putting forward proposals to cut up HMS Renown, one of the redundant boats in its charge. Dr Moonie said it was hoped that valuable information would be gained from the proposal about how to deal with the rest of the fleet. The rest of the submarine, none of which is radioactive, would be sold for scrap. This revenue, plus the smaller cost of storing the reactors on land, could make this option cheaper in the long run. The Polaris submarines came into service in 1967 and with a range of 3,000 miles one boat was always on patrol under the sea to act as a deterrent to Russian attack. They each carried 16 ballistic missiles, 16 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb and capable of destroying Moscow. They were replaced with Trident in 1994 and the last boat, HMS Repulse, was retired in 1996 with the boast that their undersea presence had never been detected by an enemy.",

The presence of British soldiers was also reported at various locations round the country. SAS units were said to have gone deep into the countryside to provide intelligence about rebel movements.</p> <p>Abandoning his previously cautious line, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"If our troops are attacked, they will fight back, I don't want the rebels to be under any misunderstanding about that.</p> <p>\"They [the rebels] would be very wise not to attempt anything that posed any form of threat to our forces.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations is pressing Britain to keep its 800 paratroopers in Sierra Leone to fight rebels advancing on the capital of Freetown. Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has abandoned hope that the United States might provide soldiers for a rapid reaction force to tackle the Revolutionary United Front and dismissed the presence of a US navy ship off the coast of the west African country as insignificant. British involvement expanded yesterday when paratroopers dug in alongside UN soldiers preparing perimeter defences for the expected rebel assault on the capital. The Ministry of Defence said British helicopters had helped ferry Jordanian UN forces upcountry from Freetown. \"Whilst we have capacity and we are there, we are open to requests to assist,\" an MoD spokesman said. The increased British involvement on the ground contrasted with the continued cabinet claims in London yesterday that the mission primarily remained to evacuate British citizens and protect the airport. Two hundred members of the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment were digging in at Aberdeen Peninsula on the outskirts of Freetown. The presence of British soldiers was also reported at various locations round the country. SAS units were said to have gone deep into the countryside to provide intelligence about rebel movements. Abandoning his previously cautious line, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"If our troops are attacked, they will fight back, I don't want the rebels to be under any misunderstanding about that. \"They [the rebels] would be very wise not to attempt anything that posed any form of threat to our forces. When I say they will not be combat troops, I don't want any misunderstanding by the rebels that these people cannot hit back and cannot hit back hard if they are attacked, and that should be fully understood by the rebels. \"But I repeat, we are not committing our forces as combat troops with the UN mission. They are there to safeguard the airport, they are there to make sure we have a means of evacuation for the 200 British nationals still there.\" Cabinet ministers last night held a crisis meeting to agree how far Britain should commit itself. Ministers are acutely sensitive after criticism from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats that they have failed to clarify the role of the British forces. A naval task force led by the helicopter carrier HMS Ocean, with a contingent of 600 Royal Marines, is due to arrive offshore tomorrow. The prime minister, Tony Blair, sees the Sierra leone crisis as a moral issue on a much more serious scale than Zimbabwe, according to officials. Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's spokesman, said: \"The prime minister emphasised that we do have extra responsibilities as a former colonial power, it would be wrong not to be there, but emphasised the troops are there for evacuation, not for combat.\" Mr Annan believes that the proposed 1,600 Nigerian troops would not be capable of defending the capital and in any case would not be sent in until after May 17, when west African leaders are due to decide on intervention. \"We would have liked to see some of the governments with capacity, with good armies and well-trained soldiers, to participate,\" said Mr Annan. \"But they are not running forward to contribute to this force.

A roly-poly fury in black Spandex and face glitter, she attempted to rub her husband's nose in the dirt (\"I'm going out quite a lot now\") only to have her plans misfire badly when he took the kids back to Auntie Mel, disgusted by Joanna's nightlife antics. </p> <p>Betrayed by her family and deprived of her children, Joanna began a desperate quest for love that was, by turns, painful and hilarious to watch. Her face, during intercourse with her new boyfriend, revealed a woman dangerously out of control of her life. </p> <p>A happy ending was dangled in front of our eyes during a seaside rapprochement, in which an older, wiser Steve and Joanna contemplated the possibility of a new life together. Her eyes lit up. \"I love Mel, Jo,\" he said, and it was all over. For Joanna, there was only escape, via Port Talbot Parkway station, and the forced optimism of a woman who's lost everything. The three protagonists, all virtual unknowns, made just about every other actor currently on TV look very silly indeed. Joanna Griffiths, on this showing, is a star. </p> <p>There was a very different sort of star on show in <strong> Predators</strong> (BBC1): a fleshy pink star with 12 tentacles which burst through earth walls like a psychotic sea anemone before pouncing on the writhing forms of its slimy victims. (Excuse the purple prose: it's difficult not the be influenced by the sometimes ludicrous melodrama of John Hannah's voiceover.) The star-nosed mole was the most charismatic of a peculiar cast of characters, all of whom use \"super-senses\" to track their prey. While Mole snaffled slugs (the appearance of teeth in the middle of its pink, fleshy, tentacled snout caused a Freudian frisson), the hammerhead shark tracked prey through electrical sensors. All of these tracking mechanisms were presented with an outrageous overuse of special effects, currently so beloved of BBC2 documentaries (remember Ape-Man?) - lemmings suddenly showing up as orange blobs, strange jump-cuts and morphing distracting from the animals' beauty. Most surprising of all was a glass shrimp being hunted by a cuttlefish. \"The shrimp signs its own death warrant,\" said John Hannah, conjuring an image much funnier than it was meant to be.</p>",

A roly-poly fury in black Spandex and face glitter, she attempted to rub her husband's nose in the dirt (\"I'm going out quite a lot now\") only to have her plans misfire badly when he took the kids back to Auntie Mel, disgusted by Joanna's nightlife antics. Betrayed by her family and deprived of her children, Joanna began a desperate quest for love that was, by turns, painful and hilarious to watch. Her face, during intercourse with her new boyfriend, revealed a woman dangerously out of control of her life. A happy ending was dangled in front of our eyes during a seaside rapprochement, in which an older, wiser Steve and Joanna contemplated the possibility of a new life together. Her eyes lit up. \"I love Mel, Jo,\" he said, and it was all over. For Joanna, there was only escape, via Port Talbot Parkway station, and the forced optimism of a woman who's lost everything. The three protagonists, all virtual unknowns, made just about every other actor currently on TV look very silly indeed. Joanna Griffiths, on this showing, is a star. There was a very different sort of star on show in Predators (BBC1): a fleshy pink star with 12 tentacles which burst through earth walls like a psychotic sea anemone before pouncing on the writhing forms of its slimy victims. (Excuse the purple prose: it's difficult not the be influenced by the sometimes ludicrous melodrama of John Hannah's voiceover.) The star-nosed mole was the most charismatic of a peculiar cast of characters, all of whom use \"super-senses\" to track their prey. While Mole snaffled slugs (the appearance of teeth in the middle of its pink, fleshy, tentacled snout caused a Freudian frisson), the hammerhead shark tracked prey through electrical sensors. All of these tracking mechanisms were presented with an outrageous overuse of special effects, currently so beloved of BBC2 documentaries (remember Ape-Man?) - lemmings suddenly showing up as orange blobs, strange jump-cuts and morphing distracting from the animals' beauty. Most surprising of all was a glass shrimp being hunted by a cuttlefish. \"The shrimp signs its own death warrant,\" said John Hannah, conjuring an image much funnier than it was meant to be.",

      "bodyText": "The Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, yesterday berated the British adoption laws for being so demanding of couples wishing to adopt children that even he would not qualify as a good parent. Dr Carey, who has four children, now grown-up, spoke of one of his sons who, with his wife, struggled through the system to adopt two small boys. The disclosure came in a speech to theologians in Texas during a week long visit by the archbishop to the US. The remarks chime with the recent call by the prime minister, Tony Blair, for adoption to be made easier in Britain and mounting concerns that some local authorities have interpreted the regulations so severely that many suitable couples are turned away or put off applying in the first place. Dr Carey said: \"In our family one of our sons has adopted two little boys. He and his wife could not have children of their own so they set out on the long and difficult journey of adoption. \"We shared this journey with them and learned a lot. We learned for example that it is not easy to adopt. English adoption laws are very tough and we were amazed by the rigorous examination of the two young people to make sure they were up to adoption. By such high standards those of us who have had children of our own would have failed time and again. Those who adopt are motivated by love.\" Concern has been raised recently that many children in residential homes would be suitable for adoption and that some authorities have been slow in following the process. A report last month, following the first nationwide survey of local authorities' adoption performances, suggested that last year 5,000 such children were suitable for adoption. However barely half had been matched with families. Although adoptions have been rising recently - up 10% in 1998-99 - only 4% of all those in care were adopted that year. The report indicated wide regional variations in the proportions of children passed for adoption by local authorities. In south London, while Sutton passed 20% of the children in its care for adoption, similar boroughs such as Barnet, north London, Ealing in west London and Lambeth, also in south London, had adoption rates of less than 1%. The issue has been further complicated by questions of extending the backgrounds of those considered eligible to adopt, following changes in the emphasis of adoption procedures from the needs of childless couples to those of the children involved. The Church of England Children's Society has been a pioneer in expanding the range of those considered suitable to include gay and unmarried couples. A government task force is studying ways of easing the adoption process and particularly for speeding up the length of time it takes couples to complete their application. Social services directors have agreed to share information and set up regional and national registers of children suitable for adoption. But care workers have cautioned that reform is more difficult than it appears because many of the children are so damaged that they need sophisticated help from adopters with more than just parenting skills. They have been scathing of politicians for jumping into a highly charged and complex issue. Last night the archbishop's 35-year-old son Mark, a former social worker who is now a vicar in Ossett, West Yorkshire, was unwilling to discuss his father's revelations. However he said that it had been easier for him and his wife to adopt the children than for other couples because of his professional background.",

      "body": "<p>I first met Jerry Hall years ago, at a party given by Jade Jagger, and she struck me then - this extraordinary, swan-like figure - as somebody I would have to paint one day. Only after I had accepted the proposal to make a television programme, and she had agreed to participate, did I discover she had already been painted by Andy Warhol and Lucian Freud. A hard act to follow, I remember thinking at the time.</p> <p>And then this modern-day icon turned up in my studio. I had the impression, from the media, of a slightly chilly persona - despite the great big smile on her face - and I was hoping to find somebody softer than the public image. I was very pleasantly surprised: she turned out to be incredibly approachable. She has, of course, been photographed countless times, but as with many models, it's only the surface that people have been photographing. An amazing surface, of course, but the great challenge with portrait painting is to go beneath and beyond that, to the person as they really are.</p> <p>There are as many motives for wanting your portrait painted as there are portraits. For English people, it's often because their families have always been painted and they don't want to be the odd one out, the empty space on the stairwell. Others love looking at portraits, love the idea of the form as a record of each generation's physiologies. But with Jerry, I think it was just the fact that it was something out of the ordinary that appealed: modelling, in a sense, but not for a camera.</p> <p>An extraordinary intimacy built up between us very quickly. This happens, to some degree, with many of my subjects: having painted many people in the public eye, I've become almost immune to their status. I find I can bypass all the awkward, embarrassing social barriers, that I can apprehend my subjects as regular people who share human troubles. But it seemed particularly the case with Jerry, and we became friends. Later on, she invited me to dinner at her house with Mick Jagger, from whom she seems extremely amicably separated. He paints, too, she said, and sends pictures to their children.</p> <p>The process of portraiture involves a certain kind of surrender on the part of the person being painted: I've painted businessmen who find it very difficult to let go, to subject themselves to a painter's brush, and others for whom the chance to relinquish professional control is surprisingly exhilarating. With Jerry, there was none of that: the portrait relies on the subject contributing their focus, their energy, and she did that amazingly well.</p> <p>I would have liked to go further. There are things you can't ask when the cameras are on you, when you know millions of people will be watching, and neither Jerry nor I could let go completely. Given the chance, I would have liked to zoom in a little more, understand a bit more about who she really is and where she comes from.</p> <p>Nevertheless, for someone so frequently photographed, so frequently interviewed, and so practised at those forms as Jerry, the portrait sitting reveals things that no other situation could. It was not an interview: if it was, I would have felt extremely uncomfortable in the role of interviewer. Instead, the portrait sitting is a discussion, and an intimate discussion at that: one-on-one, with another activity - the painting - going on, it proves very easy for people to let go of their normal social controls. They reveal things about themselves they would never dream of revealing to anyone else - and they ask me some extremely intimate questions, too. It's worth remembering that the time people spend with me, during the period I'm painting them, frequently represents a larger chunk of time than they tend to spend with their spouses. You can imagine how easy it is to become intimate.</p> <p>Or at least that's what one aims for. I took a decision a long time ago that if I was going to paint people, I really wasn't going to get into the business of pre-empting what they want to see or flattering them for money. That is an insult to the painter, but also to the subject: a flattering portrait merely reveals the vanity of the sitter, how their looks are less than perfect and how they are unhappy with how they look. I remind them that this portrait is going to be seen every day by people who love them, and that they probably love them as they are rather than as they think they might prefer to look.</p> <p>The moment I revealed the finished work to her was somewhat artificial: we wanted to see her reactions, as a filmic device, so I had probably allowed her to see much less of the work in progress than is normal. I tend not to mind my subjects seeing what I'm painting: the point about the portrait is that it is my subjective view of them, and I want the person being painted to become used to that vision over time, to become as invested in it as I am. If you present it to them only at the end, there is this awful period during which they get used to the idea that this is the image of them you've built up over many days. You want them to be pleased, and there's a terrible moment where they might not get it at all.</p> <p>So unveiling the portrait to Jerry was a fairly nervewracking moment. I stood behind her, watching, and waiting for her reaction. There was a long silence as she stared at it. Eventually, I asked her what she thought. \"It's definitely mine,\" she said. \"No one else is having it.\"</p> <p>I will be doing more paintings of Jerry, probably later in the summer: ours is a continuing friendship now, and she has commissioned me to paint her children. She even bought one of my landscapes as a gift for Mick. Apparently, he likes it.</p> <p><b>'It's beautiful'</b><br>\"I worried about whether we would get on personally, whether it would be easy to talk to him. It's a very intimate thing, having your portrait taken, [but] I like Paul's paintings, I have a lot of faith in him... The portrait is beautiful, much better than I thought.

Let us know how you get on.</p> <p>\u0095 At the BBC, Greg Dyke underlines the new openness by emailing all staff with some thoughts. \"I've just passed my 100th day as director general so I thought I'd let everyone know how things are going and in particular what's happening on some of the initiatives I've started,\" he writes. I think it's no exaggeration to say a revolution is under way. \"Believe it or not a couple of things have actually happened,\" he goes on. \"The bus service linking the BBC's different London headquarters in W1 and W12 started last week ...\" Tremendous. Get the bus service right - as I think Lord Reith himself once put it - and all else will follow.</p> <p>\u0095 In Tribune this week is a fiery polemic by a certain Michael Dougher, who works for the AEEU, about Millbank's handling of the mayoral campaign. Oddly, Mr Dougher is known as an ultra-Blairite apparatchik, and even wrote some of Dobbo's speeches, so this volte face shows great spirit, and certainly, it has nothing to do with any opportunistic attempt to boost Michael's attempts to gain the parliamentary nomination for Sheffield Healey.</p> <p>\u0095 The Sun devoted its leader column yesterday to gloating over Piers Morgan. \"Alone among newspapers,\" reads one bit, \"the Mirror did not print a word of the allegations that Morgan... bought shares that were tipped on the City Slickers page.\" We try to ring David Yelland to ask if he can recall a newspaper that failed to mention how Murdoch ditched Chris Patten's book on China - a story on many front pages at the time - but without success. It's all very well being squeaky clean in our fiscal lives, David, but at what cost if we continually lose sight of our manners?</p> <p>\u0095 Surprising news reaches us, meanwhile, of Paul Routledge, the working-class warrior marooned among the Mirror's wheeler dealers. Routers has been overheard moaning about having to have a medical - generally something one takes at the request of a private health care scheme. Can it be? Routers, valiant defender of the cradle to grave NHS? I don't believe it. After all, he could have just stuck the policy in his wife's name, surely, and got Mrs Routers to take the medical for him.</p> <p>\u0095 Complaints arrive about balloting for the NEC elections, which has been contracted out to a private firm. Many members have yet to receive their papers, and so quiet does High Command keep nowadays about the NEC elections that some may not be aware that voting closes next Thursday. Anyone who has received their papers is reminded that the fact that there are only five Grassroots Alliance candidates this year (you may recall how the West Midlands party controversially ruled out leftie Raghib Assan's nomination) doesn't mean they have to give the sixth vote to Baldrick if they don't want to.</p>",

Let us know how you get on. \u0095 At the BBC, Greg Dyke underlines the new openness by emailing all staff with some thoughts. \"I've just passed my 100th day as director general so I thought I'd let everyone know how things are going and in particular what's happening on some of the initiatives I've started,\" he writes. I think it's no exaggeration to say a revolution is under way. \"Believe it or not a couple of things have actually happened,\" he goes on. \"The bus service linking the BBC's different London headquarters in W1 and W12 started last week ...\" Tremendous. Get the bus service right - as I think Lord Reith himself once put it - and all else will follow. \u0095 In Tribune this week is a fiery polemic by a certain Michael Dougher, who works for the AEEU, about Millbank's handling of the mayoral campaign. Oddly, Mr Dougher is known as an ultra-Blairite apparatchik, and even wrote some of Dobbo's speeches, so this volte face shows great spirit, and certainly, it has nothing to do with any opportunistic attempt to boost Michael's attempts to gain the parliamentary nomination for Sheffield Healey. \u0095 The Sun devoted its leader column yesterday to gloating over Piers Morgan. \"Alone among newspapers,\" reads one bit, \"the Mirror did not print a word of the allegations that Morgan... bought shares that were tipped on the City Slickers page.\" We try to ring David Yelland to ask if he can recall a newspaper that failed to mention how Murdoch ditched Chris Patten's book on China - a story on many front pages at the time - but without success. It's all very well being squeaky clean in our fiscal lives, David, but at what cost if we continually lose sight of our manners? \u0095 Surprising news reaches us, meanwhile, of Paul Routledge, the working-class warrior marooned among the Mirror's wheeler dealers. Routers has been overheard moaning about having to have a medical - generally something one takes at the request of a private health care scheme. Can it be? Routers, valiant defender of the cradle to grave NHS? I don't believe it. After all, he could have just stuck the policy in his wife's name, surely, and got Mrs Routers to take the medical for him. \u0095 Complaints arrive about balloting for the NEC elections, which has been contracted out to a private firm. Many members have yet to receive their papers, and so quiet does High Command keep nowadays about the NEC elections that some may not be aware that voting closes next Thursday. Anyone who has received their papers is reminded that the fact that there are only five Grassroots Alliance candidates this year (you may recall how the West Midlands party controversially ruled out leftie Raghib Assan's nomination) doesn't mean they have to give the sixth vote to Baldrick if they don't want to.",

The office of the army's inspector general has substantiated charges by Lieutenant-General Claudia Kennedy - whose career has often been cited as an example to encourage women to enter the armed services - that Major-General Larry Smith touched her in a sexually inappropriate manner and tried to kiss her in a Pentagon office in 1996. The monumentally embarrassing finding comes after Gen Kennedy, who had initially decided not to press for a formal investigation of the incident, was outraged when Gen Smith was appointed deputy inspector general of the US army last year. In that post, Gen Smith would have been responsible for army discipline and misconduct investigations, includ ing sexual harassment claims. Details of the allegations against Gen Smith were leaked in March, but Pentagon officials have now confirmed that investigators who interviewed other witnesses have upheld Gen Kennedy's account of what occurred.

After Abba won the Eurovision with Waterloo, the organisers ruled that each song had to be sung in its country's own language. It was harsh but fair.

Now we're genuflecting before Air, Daft Punk and Dimitri From Paris. It's got to the stage where a British DJ has renamed himself Les Rythmes Digitales. It must be a sign of desperation that the UK's Eurovision entry this year is called Nicki French. </p> <p>Not to worry, though. A few continentals might have shaken off the naffness that is their birthright, but at Eurovision their true colours are revealed.

I feel tempted to get in touch but, having hurt her once already, would not want to do her any harm.</p> <p><b> Think of your sons</b><br>You lost everything not by doing the \"right thing\" but through playing around with another woman when you were married. Both the women you hurt have started other relationships and what you're feeling is plain old jealousy. Wishful thinking and gossip are giving you ideas about muscling in on your ex's marriage now you've nobody else to keep you company.</p> <p>You've been lucky to retain a relationship with your sons. Concentrate on setting them a good example, leave your ex alone and treat your pregnant wife with respect. Be thankful for what you still have.<br> <b> Mike Bernard</b>, Staffordshire</p> <p><b> Let go of the bitterness</b><br>Having been the \"other woman\" in a similar situation, I'd guess your former lover wouldn't welcome any overtures you make now. It isn't for others to evaluate the happiness of her marriage. She has probably heard of the change in your circumstances and chosen not to contact you.</p> <p>I think your distress is really about the end of your marriage and your fear of being usurped by your children's stepfather. My advice would be to regain some peace of mind before you begin or renew any relationships. You did the best you could in an impossible situation and your ex-lover will understand that. If you can let go of the bitterness and regret you feel, you will be able to make positive decisions about your future.<br><b>KL</b>, South London</p> <p><b> Don't approach her</b><br>My husband also left his girlfriend to come back to me and the children and for a whole year I tried to understand his mood swings. It was like living with a lovesick adolescent.</p> <p>If asked, he would claim that he was \"trying to make our marriage work\". He obviously thought that I would be grateful for his mere physical presence. I had to ask him to leave before my self-respect and self-confidence were eroded. Perhaps your wife felt the same, that you were there under duress.</p> <p>I would think carefully before approaching the other woman. You've already wrecked one marriage. My husband went back to his girlfriend but the relationship did not last. Once they were free to be together the excitement soon fizzled out.<br><b> Natalie Lewis</b>, London</p> <p><b> If she's happy, walk away</b><br>I too ended a relationship with someone I believe was the love of my life. Being with this man and knowing I should be acting responsibly by remaining with my partner to bring up our daughter drove me close to a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>However, by doing the \"right thing\" I now have a stable home life. I love my partner dearly, but that does not compensate entirely for what I have lost. I think it was Woody Allen who said: \"The heart wants what the heart wants.\" Look up your former lover to see if she is happy; if so, be content to walk away. <br><b>Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>My ex-partner, the father of four of my children, and the woman for whom he left me, moved in next door a year ago. My ex has told me that the move was not made in the interests of the children, who live with me, my new partner and our toddler, but because he liked the house. They have spent a great deal of money on it and yet cannot contribute to our four children.</p> <p>The children see their father for four hours one weekday and four hours on Saturday. A month ago one daughter asked if she could stay the night, only to be told that he was \"busy\". He was also too \"busy\" to see his kids on Christmas Day.</p> <p>Our proximity seems to be an irritant and it has been suggested that \"we move, if we don't like it\".</p> <p>What can we do?</p> <p>\u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

      "bodyText": "Five years ago I left the love of my life to go back to my wife and two sons. It broke my heart to do so but I was under pressure from family and friends and did what was perceived as the right thing. I tried to make it work but, ironically, two years later, my wife left me for another man, taking the children. Today I heard she is pregnant and I am unbearably bitter. My wife left, accusing me of not trying hard enough. I feel I lost everything through trying to do what was right. The woman I still love is now married but I've been told she isn't happy. I feel tempted to get in touch but, having hurt her once already, would not want to do her any harm. Think of your sons You lost everything not by doing the \"right thing\" but through playing around with another woman when you were married. Both the women you hurt have started other relationships and what you're feeling is plain old jealousy. Wishful thinking and gossip are giving you ideas about muscling in on your ex's marriage now you've nobody else to keep you company. You've been lucky to retain a relationship with your sons. Concentrate on setting them a good example, leave your ex alone and treat your pregnant wife with respect. Be thankful for what you still have. Mike Bernard, Staffordshire Let go of the bitterness Having been the \"other woman\" in a similar situation, I'd guess your former lover wouldn't welcome any overtures you make now. It isn't for others to evaluate the happiness of her marriage. She has probably heard of the change in your circumstances and chosen not to contact you. I think your distress is really about the end of your marriage and your fear of being usurped by your children's stepfather. My advice would be to regain some peace of mind before you begin or renew any relationships. You did the best you could in an impossible situation and your ex-lover will understand that. If you can let go of the bitterness and regret you feel, you will be able to make positive decisions about your future. KL, South London Don't approach her My husband also left his girlfriend to come back to me and the children and for a whole year I tried to understand his mood swings. It was like living with a lovesick adolescent. If asked, he would claim that he was \"trying to make our marriage work\". He obviously thought that I would be grateful for his mere physical presence. I had to ask him to leave before my self-respect and self-confidence were eroded. Perhaps your wife felt the same, that you were there under duress. I would think carefully before approaching the other woman. You've already wrecked one marriage. My husband went back to his girlfriend but the relationship did not last. Once they were free to be together the excitement soon fizzled out. Natalie Lewis, London If she's happy, walk away I too ended a relationship with someone I believe was the love of my life. Being with this man and knowing I should be acting responsibly by remaining with my partner to bring up our daughter drove me close to a nervous breakdown. However, by doing the \"right thing\" I now have a stable home life. I love my partner dearly, but that does not compensate entirely for what I have lost. I think it was Woody Allen who said: \"The heart wants what the heart wants.\" Look up your former lover to see if she is happy; if so, be content to walk away. Name and address withheld Next week My ex-partner, the father of four of my children, and the woman for whom he left me, moved in next door a year ago. My ex has told me that the move was not made in the interests of the children, who live with me, my new partner and our toddler, but because he liked the house. They have spent a great deal of money on it and yet cannot contribute to our four children. The children see their father for four hours one weekday and four hours on Saturday. A month ago one daughter asked if she could stay the night, only to be told that he was \"busy\". He was also too \"busy\" to see his kids on Christmas Day. Our proximity seems to be an irritant and it has been suggested that \"we move, if we don't like it\". What can we do? \u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

The idea that the workforce is stuck in a 70s time-warp, playing cards when they should be making cars, is an utter myth. This is no industrial dinosaur. It produces as many cars per worker as the Cologne plant, to which production of the Fiesta will be transferred next year. Why then is Ford taking this step?

Car companies take investment decisions on a 20-year time horizon, not on short-term currency fluctuations, so we have to look elsewhere for the true explanation. </p> <p>The first reason is simple. This is how companies are forced to behave in the modern world. There is massive overcapacity in the industry. Either the company had to stop producing cars somewhere or it would feel the impact on its bottom line. Restructuring and consolidation of the industry has been going on apace in recent years, which is why Daimler has tied the knot with Chrysler, Nissan has clambered into bed with Renault, and the new owners of Longbridge are desperately looking around for a suitable match. But that still does not explain why the people in Detroit have picked on Dagenham rather than on Cologne. Both sites were built at around the same time - 1930 for Cologne, 1931 for Dagenham - and both produce around the same number of cars, just short of 200,000 a year. So, the second reason why Dagenham has lost out is because it is far easier and cheaper for Ford to end production of the Fiesta in Britain than it would be in Germany, where workers enjoy far more protection and the costs to the company of mass redundancies would be far higher. This is the price we pay for Britain's much vaunted labour-market flexibility; it may encourage firms to come here, but it makes it simpler for them to pull the plug as well. </p> <p>Ford's actions say much about the power structures of the new globalised world. None of the options available to the UK government looks all that attractive. As an administration committed to the Anglo-Saxon model, and one which has lectured the rest of Europe about the merits of deregulating labour markets, Labour is hardly likely to start importing the sort of social protection which may have kept those Cologne workers in their jobs. Likewise, the government is not about to slap on import controls, take Dagenham into public ownership or hand Ford a pot of money to bribe it to stay. This does not leave ministers many options. But that does not mean that they should be allowed to get away with offering little more than tea and sympathy in the form of retraining and counselling while yet another industrial community is disembowelled. The dreadful experience of abandoned pit villages is testimony to the failure of an exclusively supply-side approach to regeneration. When the guts are ripped out of an area, the result can be a downward spiral in which the affluent and the mobile move out, leaving behind what Frank Field has called welfare economies. </p> <p>Mr Field argues that the government needs to reflate demand in these areas through cutting employers' national insurance contributions, concentrating government contracts in unemployment blackspots and using local labour and public money to rebuild the social fabric through investment in schools, in libraries and in public spaces.

The DVLA said it was considering lodging a formal complaint with the telecommunications watchdog, Oftel, after discovering that BT's actions had prevented callers from getting through to its 0870 inquiry line. The Swansea-based DVLA customer service centre, which handles 8m inquiries a year, is manned by staff offering advice on subjects as diverse as new driving licences, medical requirements for driving, car number plates, driver training and vehicle registration. The government motoring agency, already under severe strain with the introduction of photo driving licences and the new rates of vehicle excise duty, claims BT has been preventing its customers from getting through even when lines are available, to the frustration of motorists who find the number engaged for days on end. In response, BT said it had no option but to restrict calls to the helpline at peak periods or it would risk \"paralysing the whole of Swansea's phone network\". It said it used a similar call blocking technique whenever the DVLA issued cherished number plates or new vehicle registrations. It also used call blocking for TV programmes which encouraged telephone participation, such as Who Wants to be a Millionaire? A DVLA report said the agency was considering making a formal complaint to Oftel after BT said it could do nothing to solve the problem, which worsened this week after a network fault on Tuesday paralysed the entire 0870 call system.

The protest was the latest sign of continuing resistance to the campaign against the Falun Gong, which began last July after the meditation and Buddhism-inspired movement outraged China's leaders by organising a peaceful 10,000-strong sit-in outside government headquarters. The government says the Falun Gong is an evil cult, and accuses the New York-based Mr Li of causing more than 1,500 deaths by encouraging his followers not to use medicine.

At the time the town had four museums. Their treasures included archaeological finds from nearby Vucedol, and the Bauer collection of mainly 19th century oil paintings.</p> <p>There were also impressive private collections of paintings, as well as the ecclesiastical artefacts in the Franciscan monastery and the Serbian Orthodox Church of St Nicholas.</p> <p>During the siege, many items were stored in the basement of the monastery. By the time the Croats defending Vukovar realised the importance of moving them, it was too late - all roads out were cut. The city fell to Serb forces in November 1991.</p> <p>At this point, Serb and Croat versions of the story differ.</p> <p>According to the Institute for the Protection of Monuments in Serbia, the items were moved to Serbia - mainly to Novi Sad - for their own protection.</p> <p>\"Vukovar was in ruins, we could hardly move for the rubble,\" says Marko Omcikus, an art historian from the institute who took part in the evacuation of the objects on lorries donated by the Yugoslav army, and in private cars.</p> <p>The Croatian authorities accuse the Serbs of looting the museums, thereby flouting the 1954 Hague convention. According to Visnja Zgaga of the museum documentation centre in Zagreb, the Croats have not received a single direct communication from the relevant Serb authorities. She also says that inventory lists allegedly provided by the Serbs to a Unesco-Council of Europe fact-finding mission in 1995 never reached Croatia.</p> <p>\"According to the testimony of people who were transporting these objects, a lot of things didn't arrive where they were supposed to,\" says Ksenija Popovic, head of the cultural department of Novi Sad council. \"Which means that during the transportation, there was an organised robbery, and every trace of these objects was simply lost.\"</p> <p>Paintings stolen from elsewhere in what was Serb-occupied Croatia have been discovered on sale in Hungary and Germany. Ms Popovic believes that all the objects which have survived should be returned to Vukovar. But she fears that they have already become bargaining chips in a long list of unresolved property issues between Croatia and Serbia.</p> <p>Tentative negotiations have taken place between the Croatian and Yugoslav foreign ministries on the subject. In 1998, it was agreed that \"a future bilateral agreement on cultural cooperation\" will be based on the registration and return to Croatia of cultural property.</p> <p>The Serbs have since turned to Unesco with their own problem - the destruction or disappearance of Serbian Orthodox artefacts from Kosovo.</p> <p>In the museum in Novi Sad, Mr Gacic points to two huge wooden doors. \"When Nato bombed the bridges a year ago, these were blown off their hinges,\" he says. And the ancient pots from Vukovar nearly perished again.</p>",

At the time the town had four museums. Their treasures included archaeological finds from nearby Vucedol, and the Bauer collection of mainly 19th century oil paintings. There were also impressive private collections of paintings, as well as the ecclesiastical artefacts in the Franciscan monastery and the Serbian Orthodox Church of St Nicholas. During the siege, many items were stored in the basement of the monastery. By the time the Croats defending Vukovar realised the importance of moving them, it was too late - all roads out were cut. The city fell to Serb forces in November 1991. At this point, Serb and Croat versions of the story differ. According to the Institute for the Protection of Monuments in Serbia, the items were moved to Serbia - mainly to Novi Sad - for their own protection. \"Vukovar was in ruins, we could hardly move for the rubble,\" says Marko Omcikus, an art historian from the institute who took part in the evacuation of the objects on lorries donated by the Yugoslav army, and in private cars. The Croatian authorities accuse the Serbs of looting the museums, thereby flouting the 1954 Hague convention. According to Visnja Zgaga of the museum documentation centre in Zagreb, the Croats have not received a single direct communication from the relevant Serb authorities. She also says that inventory lists allegedly provided by the Serbs to a Unesco-Council of Europe fact-finding mission in 1995 never reached Croatia. \"According to the testimony of people who were transporting these objects, a lot of things didn't arrive where they were supposed to,\" says Ksenija Popovic, head of the cultural department of Novi Sad council. \"Which means that during the transportation, there was an organised robbery, and every trace of these objects was simply lost.\" Paintings stolen from elsewhere in what was Serb-occupied Croatia have been discovered on sale in Hungary and Germany. Ms Popovic believes that all the objects which have survived should be returned to Vukovar. But she fears that they have already become bargaining chips in a long list of unresolved property issues between Croatia and Serbia. Tentative negotiations have taken place between the Croatian and Yugoslav foreign ministries on the subject. In 1998, it was agreed that \"a future bilateral agreement on cultural cooperation\" will be based on the registration and return to Croatia of cultural property. The Serbs have since turned to Unesco with their own problem - the destruction or disappearance of Serbian Orthodox artefacts from Kosovo. In the museum in Novi Sad, Mr Gacic points to two huge wooden doors. \"When Nato bombed the bridges a year ago, these were blown off their hinges,\" he says. And the ancient pots from Vukovar nearly perished again.",

Recent Strasbourg cases where Liberty has successfully used the convention to challenge injustice include the MoD Four, which resulted in the lifting of the ban on lesbians and gay men serving in the military, and Steel Lush and Others v UK, concerning the detention of peaceful, law abiding protesters under \"breach of the peace\" powers. The Act will have profound implications for many public authorities, not just the courts and the police, and of course for the individual citizen, whose civil and political rights will be written down, easily understood and enforceable in the domestic courts for the first time in history.

A great designer and a rare human being, she was the last survivor of the famous design team known as Motley. </p> <p>Percy came from a genteel background in Kent. She had two brothers, one who died when he was four, and the other in the first world war. Her mother died when she was 12, leaving her elder sister, Sophie, to take care of the family. At 17, Percy went to art school with Sophie, where they met Elizabeth Montgomery. They immediately became friends and started going to the theatre together. </p> <p>They had no theatrical experience, and there was much that they found boring and visually unattractive, especially at the Old Vic. They made drawings of some of the actors in costume and sent them to the theatre, hoping the players would buy them. John Gielgud saw the work and suggested that the young women should be asked to design the costumes for the 1932 production of Romeo And Juliet that he and George Devine were planning. </p> <p>This proved to be a truly historic production, which laid the foundation of Percy's long association with Gielgud, and her lasting friendship with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Devine who, as well as being president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society at the time, played Mercutio and helped machine the costumes. </p> <p>When the trio started to design professionally, they chose the name \"Motley\". Gielgud hated it: \"So anonymous,\" he said. But it was typical of those three talented girls that they were not seeking fame or recognition; they just wanted to work, and with the best people. </p> <p>Motley's first big success was Richard of Bordeaux (1932), with Gielgud, which precipitated the need for more space and their move into a derelict studio in St Martin's Lane, London. The studio became the heart of theatre life, with people dropping in before and after performances; there was work and talk, talk and work going on all the time, with passionate discussions about the theatre, far into the night. Devine became financial manager, to rescue the team from financial chaos. </p> <p>From then on, the Motleys were at the centre of a new flowering of English theatre led singlehandedly by Gielgud (for which Percy thought he was never given proper credit). </p> <p>Richard of Bordeaux was a breakthrough in terms of theatre design. It was a visual revolution in the West End, then dominated by costumes of rich materials covered with tinsel, bright gilt braid and other elaborate trappings. In contrast, Motley created beautiful effects in scenery and costumes with the humblest of materials and a quarter of the budget. In Richard, the costumes were mostly made of wool, but they also used unbleached calico, dishcloths, mosquito netting, painted linen, huckaback towelling and felt. To make leather, they took thick felt and treated it with kitchen soap and paint - with miraculous results. </p> <p>Hamlet (1934) was another Gielgud production that Percy was proud of. They used scene canvas sprayed with gold, silver and copper metallic pigment for the first time. To begin with, Percy worked mostly with Gielgud, then with Michel St Denis and Devine. During this period, she designed, among others, St Denis's famous production of The Three Sisters, Noah, The Merchant Of Venice, The White Guard and The Cherry Orchard, in all of which Gielgud played a leading part. </p> <p>In spite of being in constant demand as a designer, Percy somehow found time to teach, first at the London Theatre Studio, where I was one of her students. She was a born teacher - calm, clear and encouraging. She was completely honest in her opinions of one's work, but her criticisms were never destructive. She managed to say what she thought didn't work in terms of the interpretation, or for technical reasons, but always left you feeling you could see your way to improve your design. </p> <p>The beginning of the second world war found Percy in the United States, designing yet another Romeo And Juliet, this time for Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. It was performed in California and New York. Percy, unlike Elizabeth Montgomery, did not like Hollywood or New York. Luckily, she met the furniture designer Charles Eames in the drawing office of MGM, became friends with him and his wife, and was able to divide her time between designing and making splints for the wounded in his studio in Los Angeles and dashing back to New York to work. </p> <p>After the war, Michel, George and Glen Byam Shaw asked Percy to return to England to help with their plan to start a new school. Working at the Old Vic school, and designing for Stratford and the West End, was a gruelling task, but she managed it in her indomitable way. This was the beginning of her long collaboration with Glen Byam Shaw, which culminated in opera at Sadler's Wells and the Coliseum. </p> <p>Percy worked with Byam Shaw so often that she could anticipate when he would agree or disagree. Often, they didn't know which of them had thought up an idea. Glen's family called him \"the kitten\", and Angela Baddeley called Percy and Glen \"the owl and the pussycat\" when they were working together. That started Percy's owl collection - to which friends added all her life. The productions she worked on with Byam Shaw at Stratford include Antony And Cleopatra, Coriolanus, Julius Caesar, Much Ado About Nothing, and King Lear with Charles Laughton. </p> <p>When Devine became artistic director of the Royal Court theatre in 1956, Percy created the first permanent surround, and designed The Mulberry Bush, The Country Wife, Major Barbara and Rosmersholm, among others. She eventually became resident designer at Sadler's Wells with Glen, and they both moved to the Coliseum when the ENO took it over. </p> <p>In 1968, while still at Sadler's Wells, Percy started her own design school, which became the Motley Theatre Design School (now in Drury Lane). In her gallant way, she continued running the school until a few months ago, when, as a result of a series of small strokes, she had finally to give up. </p> <p>She may have thought of the school as her finest achievement. It was for graduate designers and, over the years, has provided hundreds of students with an intense training in the art of theatre design. In her gentle and unobtrusive way, Percy conveyed her beliefs on the role of the designer in the theatre, and the values that had influenced her life and work - values formed by working with all the major directors in Europe and the US. </p> <p>Recently, she taught less herself, preferring to leave it to younger colleagues, but she still auditioned new students, knew all their names and was always there to listen to a problem and give encouragement when needed. If you meet an ex-student of Motley and ask them about the school, it is always Percy they remember. The school went through numerous financial crises, and many changes of venue; the fact that it survived was due to the loyalty, generosity and hard work of a small group of supporters inspired by Percy's dogged determination to keep it going. </p> <p>Percy was in many ways a loner and didn't socialise much, even as a child. She never married, but established long and lasting friendships with many of the people she worked with. Her work was her life, and the amount she achieved in the theatre and in opera was prodigious. </p> <p>If I was asked to find one word to describe Percy, it would be \"integrity\". She was someone of supreme talent, not fussed about being famous, a person of simplicity, honesty and extraordinary humility, not seemingly aware of what she had achieved in her long life, or why so many people loved and admired her so much. </p> <p> Margaret 'Percy' Frances Harris, theatre designer, born May 28 1904; died May 10 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain will block ambitious plans for a new European charter of fundamental rights when France takes over the EU presidency later this summer, the Guardian has learned. After months of claiming that Britain is winning arguments in Europe, Tony Blair is signalling strong objections to the charter as well as to wider French ideas for a hard core of nations that could forge ahead with integration. Mr Blair sees Jose-Maria Aznar, the Spanish prime minister and a conservative nationalist, as a vital ally during a period of tough negotiations, officials said yesterday. France takes over the rotating presidency from Portugal on July 1, and must forge agreement on crucial institutional reforms that have to be written into the Treaty of Nice in December. Diplomats were last night predicting a bloody battle over the re-weighting of votes, a key element of changes necessary if the 15-strong EU is to avoid paralysis when it takes some 12 new members in coming years. But it is the charter of rights, initiated by federalist-minded MEPs and backed by a powerful coalition including Germany and Italy, that is causing most anxiety in London. MEPs and representatives of national parliaments and governments are close to completing a document enshrining the right to strike and other social and economic rights that the CBI has warned will damage labour market flexibility. Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister, told the national assembly in Paris on Tuesday that the charter, which supporters see as an embryonic European constitution, would have to deal with growth and employment, health and social security, as well as liberty and justice. Whitehall officials insist the charter should be a showcase for existing rights, not a launchpad for new ones. Britain is worried that even outside the treaty a strong charter could affect judgments in the European court of justice. \"We will be tough in going beyond existing rights,\" said one senior source. \"We're really going to crack the whip on that.\" Generally, British officials fear attempts by France to revive its flagging relationship with Germany - as the indispensable motor of the EU. London is already feeling the chill of being excluded from the euro-11 group of finance ministers who participate in the single currency. France was stung by criticism of its passivity at March's Lisbon \"dot.com\" summit, where Mr Blair, allied with counterparts from Spain, Portugal and Belgium, did much to set the agenda on market liberalisation and e-commerce. Paris and Berlin are reacting to a mounting sense that the core values and purpose of the founding members of the EU are being diluted by enlargement and an Anglo-Saxon plot to transform the union into a glorified free-trade area.
