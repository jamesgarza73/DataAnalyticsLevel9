      "bodyText": "The foot and mouth crisis which has assailed Britain was becoming a global problem today as an outbreak was confirmed in Argentina and the world increasingly shunned European meat. The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea have all moved to ban some agricultural imports from Europe, following the first continental confirmation of an outbreak in a rural corner of north-west France yesterday. The European Union responded to the outbreak by ruling all exports of live animals from France will be banned, but many countries are taking more extreme precautionary measures against the disease. Meanwhile, more suspected cases are being investigated in France as farmers slaughtered and burned affected livestock. The outbreak in Argentina has put the country's \u00a3344m beef export sector at risk and sent shockwaves through the US farming community that the disease has reached the American continent. In Britain, 26 new cases were confirmed today, bringing the national total to 231. The scale of the crisis is already worse than the 1967 epidemic at the same stage, the chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said yesterday. The government today repelled growing pressure from countryside leaders to delay elections as the foot and mouth crisis escalated. Almost half the rural county councils affected by the disease have expressed their opposition to elections in May, because of the impact on campaigning, according to a survey. The leaders of 10 of the 25 affected councils said the prime minister, Tony Blair, should delay the elections until June at the earliest, with only three saying he should press ahead, the Times newspaper found. But the environment minister, Michael Meacher, who is heading the foot and mouth task force, said the government still intended to schedule local elections on May 3 unless the situation degenerated. In Cornwall, the opening of the world's largest greenhouse, the \u00a380m Eden project, will take place as planned this Saturday despite the present foot and mouth crisis gripping the countryside. In the US, officials yesterday suspended all imports of livestock and fresh meat from the EU, and Canada slapped a similar ban on imports of livestock, farm products and even used farm equipment from the EU. A similar Canadian ban was already in place for Britain. The ban is expected to have the biggest impact on imports of pork from the Netherlands and Denmark. Imports of beef from the EU were already banned because of mad cow disease. However, EU officials expressed surprise that the US import ban extended to all 15 member countries. \"Thirteen EU states are disease free.

Peter Mandelson, Keith Vaz and their numerous officials were guilty of no wrong- doing; their relationships with the Hinduja brothers were perfectly sound.</p> <p>On Monday the House of Commons sleazebusting committee of MPs issued another set of exonerations, this time not quite as complete. Their probe into the earlier affairs of Mr Vaz cleared him of nine charges, finding him guilty on only one: failing to declare that a man he had nominated for inclusion in the honours' list just so happened to be a contributor to his own constituency fund. Still, that was not too serious, certainly not worthy of any punishment. The committee decided no action was necessary.</p> <p>And there has been an equally cheery verdict on the weekend reports that Downing Street intervened in a controversial planning application by the billionaire arms broker, Wafic Said. Sure, an official memo spoke of \"pressure from the prime minister's office not to delay the decision\" on Said's plan to build a business school on the site of a much-loved old railway station in Oxford. But that means nothing. Number 10 insists it was merely concerned with the timing of the decision, not the decision itself. Once again, everybody behaved perfectly properly.</p> <p>So given this rash of good news - confirming our public officials' complete probity and propriety - why do we feel so bad? Why is this sequence of denials, rebuttals and exonerations not good enough? If the rules say nothing wrong happened, why doesn't it feel quite right?</p> <p>The answer is common sense. Forget what the reports and inquiries say; these cases are all versions of the same, all-too-familiar story: someone, somewhere got special treatment because they have money.</p> <p>Hammond confirms it. Even as he insists there was no wrongdoing, he provides chapter and verse on the extraordinary efforts made in pursuit of the Hindujas' applications for British citizenship. Their forms weren't processed by some overworked staffer in the passport office - they were championed by the head of the immigration and nationality directorate himself. The rules were bent, too, so that SP Hinduja got his passport in a quarter of the normal time, even though he clearly did not meet the usual residency requirements. Watching over it all were a choir of guardian angels, from Margaret Thatcher and Edward Heath to Peter Mandelson and Jack Straw, all doing their bit to make sure the Hindujas' request was dealt with \"helpfully\".</p> <p>Hammond accepts all this as perfectly proper, but we don't have to. We know what it amounts to: special treatment for the wealthy. Just as we knew it when Tony Blair exempted Formula One from the ban on tobacco advertising after Bernie Ecclestone gave \u00a31m to the Labour party. We knew it when the Tories bagged a peerage for Michael Ashcroft soon after he gave the party so much money he became their treasurer. The officials may tell us everything is \"proper\"; but all that proves is their definition of \"proper\" is wrong - and we ought to get a new one.</p> <p>But how? How can we stop money talking? The default response is to demand that politicians stay well clear of millionaires, by freeing them of the need to raise cash in the first place. Then Blair and William Hague wouldn't have to grovel to the likes of Ecclestone and Ashcroft. The state could fund political parties and all would be well.</p> <p>Wrong. Even if state funding did not contain risks of its own - like squeezing out new movements by denying them funds - it would not solve the problem. After all, the Hindujas were not offering money to the Labour party, but to the dome.

But that's what the MPs who just cleared Vaz are meant to do - and just look how ineffective they are. They had to give up on eight additional charges against the minister because he refused to cooperate with their inquiries.

And we may find it in, of all places, the law.</p> <p>For what is the real offence in the Hinduja case, or episodes like it? Surely it's the clear evidence that there's one rule for the rich and another for everyone else. It is a violation of our deep belief that everyone should be equal under the law. That can be more than a sentimental hope. In the United States, the 14th amendment's insistence on \"equal protection of the laws\" has formed the basis for countless civil rights actions demanding fairness and an end to discrimination. It was that clause which underpinned 1954's legendary Brown v Board of Education decision, ending the racial segregation of America's schools. It has been invoked regularly ever since, with Americans petitioning their courts to outlaw preferential treatment for one group of individuals over another.</p> <p>That option is now open to us. Under a happy coincidence, we have a 14th amendment of our own: article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, now absorbed into British law as the Human Rights Act. That article bars discrimination on grounds of sex, race, colour and \"any other status.\" That \"other status\" could be wealth.</p> <p>Put simply, there is nothing to stop two, hypothetical Patel brothers petitioning the courts to demand why the passport request they made for their third brother was not treated as swiftly as Prakash Hinduja's. A Wafic Smith could complain that the decision on his planning project was not announced as swiftly as Wafic Said's. Bernie Bloggs could claim discrimination denied him the policy exemption that so pleased Bernie Ecclestone.</p> <p>Such scenarios need not be fanciful. Leading human rights lawyer Keir Starmer says: \"The whole point of the Human Rights Act is to give protection against discrimination - and discrimination against those with less money could come within the prohibitions set out in article 14.\" As long as you amassed the evidence and could prove that, say, the Patels and the Hindujas were genuinely comparable in every other respect bar riches, Starmer reckons you could make a serious challenge under the act. At the very least, it would force the discriminating authority to explain why they favoured one set of individuals over another.</p> <p>The experts always told us this new law would make a big difference. In the US the bill of rights has long been used to advance civil rights, from abortion to women's status at work, that were too hot for the politicians to handle. Now it can be our turn.

      "body": "<p>Ministers were yesterday seriously starting to consider delaying the election set for May 3 in the wake of the spread and persistence of foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>Cabinet members and party strategists were anxiously looking in their diaries for possible booby traps and disasters that might await them if they put off the election until the autumn.</p> <p>No prime minister likes to get knocked off a preferred election date, let alone be at the mercy of a disease that no one seems to be able to control. But the danger for Tony Blair is that if he presses ahead with the election, as well as the 34 county council polls, it would be viewed as another sign that Labour does not care for the countryside. Even worse, it could deteriorate into a slanging match about whether or not the election is being conducted freely and fairly in rural constituencies.</p> <p>Labour's local goverment chief, Sir Jeremy Beecham, protested: \"This is a non issue. Anyone can apply for a postal vote and post is being delivered to outer reaches of farms. The Tories do not have any door to door canvassers. They do it by phone\" But some ministers, including those in agriculture, fear that Labour could be hit by cries of \"fix\". Rural seats are, after all, still overwhelmingly Conservative.</p> <p>Unless the prime minister can hold a postponed election in June, he will probably have to delay it until October, or even later.</p> <p>The Conservatives, given their current poll standing, are desperate for a delay, but cannot say so publicly. \"Things can only get better for them,\" one minister said yesterday.</p> <p>There are some unwelcome events between now and the autumn that might make the electorate look at Labour in a more jaundiced light. The single biggest factor is the world economy.</p> <p>At present, the British economy could not be in a better position. Inflation is consistently undershooting its 2.5% target. Interest rates are likely to fall further. Unemployment is set to dip below 1m today for the first time in 25 years.</p> <p>Mr Blair will mark the moment with an employment green paper promising \u00a3120m in measures to target the jobless who are not claiming the job seekers' allowance. He will hold out the prospect of a return to full employment. However, there are storm clouds gathering, with US shares falling fast in the wake of corporate profit warnings, especially high technology stocks. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock index fell by 3.6% yesterday to its lowest level since April 1985. The EU's economy has also been slowing in the past five months.</p> <p>The already-tricky timetable for handling the euro-referendum would also be complicated by an election delay.</p> <p>Not all the factors work against postponment. The home secretary, Jack Straw, will be under less pressure as police numbers continue to rise slowly, judging by the figures for the numbers of police in training. He might also be able to claim the government is getting closer to meeting its target of halving the amount of time it takes for young offenders to be sentenced.</p> <p>At health, Alan Milburn, the heath secretary, might welcome delay. NHS waiting lists go up over winter and drop through the summer and early autumn. If the election is held in October, Labour would be able to say it has more than met its target to cut 100,000 from the inherited waiting list.</p> <p>John Prescott's marathon tussle with London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, and Bob Kiley over control of the scheme for modernising the London Underground is also awkwardly timed for a spring poll. With commuters iincreasingly frustrated by erratic trains and tubes, more time might mean progress.</p> <p>Downing Street and Millbank publicly remain determined to push ahead with the May 3 timetable - despite growing concern among rural MPs in all parties. If so, parliament would have to clear up its business by April 5 to comply with election law.</p> <p>There are two jokers in the pack. The government has missed the deadline for delaying the county council elections in the 34 county councils in England. Mr Straw would need to make pass primary legislation to delay the council elections, probably with all-party support.

      "bodyText": "Ministers were yesterday seriously starting to consider delaying the election set for May 3 in the wake of the spread and persistence of foot and mouth disease. Cabinet members and party strategists were anxiously looking in their diaries for possible booby traps and disasters that might await them if they put off the election until the autumn. No prime minister likes to get knocked off a preferred election date, let alone be at the mercy of a disease that no one seems to be able to control. But the danger for Tony Blair is that if he presses ahead with the election, as well as the 34 county council polls, it would be viewed as another sign that Labour does not care for the countryside. Even worse, it could deteriorate into a slanging match about whether or not the election is being conducted freely and fairly in rural constituencies. Labour's local goverment chief, Sir Jeremy Beecham, protested: \"This is a non issue. Anyone can apply for a postal vote and post is being delivered to outer reaches of farms. The Tories do not have any door to door canvassers. They do it by phone\" But some ministers, including those in agriculture, fear that Labour could be hit by cries of \"fix\". Rural seats are, after all, still overwhelmingly Conservative. Unless the prime minister can hold a postponed election in June, he will probably have to delay it until October, or even later. The Conservatives, given their current poll standing, are desperate for a delay, but cannot say so publicly. \"Things can only get better for them,\" one minister said yesterday. There are some unwelcome events between now and the autumn that might make the electorate look at Labour in a more jaundiced light. The single biggest factor is the world economy. At present, the British economy could not be in a better position. Inflation is consistently undershooting its 2.5% target. Interest rates are likely to fall further. Unemployment is set to dip below 1m today for the first time in 25 years. Mr Blair will mark the moment with an employment green paper promising \u00a3120m in measures to target the jobless who are not claiming the job seekers' allowance. He will hold out the prospect of a return to full employment. However, there are storm clouds gathering, with US shares falling fast in the wake of corporate profit warnings, especially high technology stocks. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock index fell by 3.6% yesterday to its lowest level since April 1985. The EU's economy has also been slowing in the past five months. The already-tricky timetable for handling the euro-referendum would also be complicated by an election delay. Not all the factors work against postponment. The home secretary, Jack Straw, will be under less pressure as police numbers continue to rise slowly, judging by the figures for the numbers of police in training. He might also be able to claim the government is getting closer to meeting its target of halving the amount of time it takes for young offenders to be sentenced. At health, Alan Milburn, the heath secretary, might welcome delay. NHS waiting lists go up over winter and drop through the summer and early autumn. If the election is held in October, Labour would be able to say it has more than met its target to cut 100,000 from the inherited waiting list. John Prescott's marathon tussle with London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, and Bob Kiley over control of the scheme for modernising the London Underground is also awkwardly timed for a spring poll. With commuters iincreasingly frustrated by erratic trains and tubes, more time might mean progress. Downing Street and Millbank publicly remain determined to push ahead with the May 3 timetable - despite growing concern among rural MPs in all parties. If so, parliament would have to clear up its business by April 5 to comply with election law. There are two jokers in the pack. The government has missed the deadline for delaying the county council elections in the 34 county councils in England. Mr Straw would need to make pass primary legislation to delay the council elections, probably with all-party support. In theory the legislation need not be passed until days before the council elections, but in reality - to ensure pointless canvassing did not go ahead - it would have to be passed earlier. The second joker is the census, due to take place on April 29 and requiring an army of government enumerators to knock on the nation's front door.

France confirmed its first outbreak and EU vets banned all livestock exports from the country for a fortnight.</p> <p>The dramatic increase in the scale of the problem in the last few days has upset all hopes of an early end to the crisis and the government is now seriously considering delaying the general election beyond May.</p> <p>The disease has been randomly spread over the country by sheep dealers, Mr Scudamore said. Many movements were untraceable and there were unknown numbers of animals incubating the disease.</p> <p>In 1967, there was only one centre of the disease, on the Welsh border with Shropshire. Now there are three large areas where the outbreaks are both intensifying and spreading across neighbouring farms.</p> <p>Although the number of farms where foot and mouth has been confirmed is fewer than at the same stage of the 1967 epidemic, the scale of modern farms means much bigger numbers of animals are in contact with the disease. Farms are six times as big as the average holding in 1967 and many have more than 1,000 animals, compared with an average of 100 then.</p> <p>The large-scale slaughter being carried out daily to try to contain the disease is causing logistical problems in the disposal of carcasses: instead of burying small herds or flocks on farms as happened in 1967, dead animals are having to be burned or rendered, both far more difficult to organise.</p> <p>In the first three weeks of the present outbreak, 170,000 animals had been earmarked for slaughter on 333 premises, compared with 430,000 animals on 2,300 farms in the six months of the 1967 outbreak, Mr Scudamore said.</p> <p>Yesterday, for example, at William Davidson's farm at Poldean Wamphrey, Moffat, in Dumfries, 483 cattle and 1,612 sheep were condemned in one new outbreak.</p> <p>The average number of animals to be slaughtered per confirmed case has risen from fewer than 200 in 1967 to more than 600 this time.</p> <p>The sheer size of the flocks being condemned seems to have initially masked the seriousness of the outbreak. A few sick sheep in 1,000 would not be noticed. A second or third wave of infection is breaking out before enough animals became ill for the farmer to notice.</p> <p>Mr Brown, the agriculture minister, said: \"We did what we could right at the beginning. We put movement restrictions on as quickly as possible but it had already got out into the national flock and is still incubating.</p> <p>\"It is a very serious situation; we do not know where it will emerge and we do not know how much of it there is. We are not able to make any judgments at all about when it will peak.\"</p> <p>Mr Scudamore added: \"Once we reach a peak we can begin to estimate how long it will take to go down, how long the tail will be. It could be a very long tail.\"</p> <p>Jim Walker, president of the Scottish National Farmers' Union said after meeting Tony Blair yesterday: \"It is time for pre-emptive action to take possible carriers out of the system. While such steps will bring further heartache to farmers, there is little doubt that we are dealing with a disease that is crippling our industry.\"</p> <p>Yesterday a task force was set up under Michael Meacher, the environment minister, to try to help beleaguered rural industries heavily dependent on the tourist trade, which is collapsing in affected areas. The government is discussing compensation, including not paying business rates, to stave off a wave of bankruptcies. Rural tourism supports 380,000 jobs in England alone.</p> <p>Emergency measures will be announced in the next 48 hours to try to rescue half a million sheep forced to give birth to lambs away from the shelter of home farms and stranded in open fields because of movement restrictions.Mr Brown is reluctant to destroy healthy flocks but nervous about allowing movements which could spread infection. The army might be used as escorts.</p> <p>The idea of using army snipers to kill farm animals has been discussed by ministers but will only be used as a last resort. While troops are trained to use guns, they know nothing of humane slaughter of animals.</p> <p>Among yesterday's new cases, the three areas which were of most concern were a large area of the north including Northumberland, Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway, the central border area of Wales, where Powys was becoming an increasing problem, and Devon where the disease had centred on the sheep dealer Willy Cleave's 13 farms and spread. It is these areas where there are large concentrations of sheep.</p> <p>\"Potentially, in these three areas we have a very serious problem indeed,\" Mr Scudamore said.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

He also called on Tony Blair to instruct all ministers to answer questions from the watchdog after it emerged that Mr Vaz had refused to deal with Mrs Filkin so she could not complete her inquiries into eight allegations against the Foreign Office minister. The aftermath of the Vaz inquiry - despite official support from Mr Blair's spokesman and the foreign secretary, Robin Cook - is pointing to the minister being dropped from the government after the election. Even though he was cleared on nine points, his attitude towards the commissioner was being seen as \"arrogant\" by many MPs. The situation is also leading to renewed support for Mrs Filkin from MPs who had been previously been silent on the matter and had privately dubbed her \"Mrs Longnose \" because of her detailed inquiries into their business interests. The growing support for Mrs Filkin follows anger among members of the standards and privileges committee about the way she was treated by MPs and by lawyers called in to advise MPs and witnesses. Correspondence from one solicitor, Mark Stephens, of the law firm, Finers Stephens Innocent, to be published next week, is unanimously described by the committee as \"unacceptable\".

Officially, as it claims at every election, the party is fighting to win every seat in England, Scotland and Wales, in an effort to build on its record total of 47 seats (including last year's surprise byelection victory in Romsey). In 1997, strategists believe, they set their sights too low, ending up narrowly missing some former Tory strongholds. So, where former leader Paddy Ashdown spent a great deal of the 1997 campaign yomping round the target seats of the south-west, Mr Kennedy will hop by plane, bus and helicopter through every region with - organisers hope - at least a fraction of his predecessor's energy.</p> <p><b> Calculation</b><br></p> <p>Alongside the rhetoric of \"every seat a target seat\", the Lib Dems are privately playing their usual game of campaigning by numbers, albeit this time with more precise calculation and information than ever before.</p> <p>With a campaign budget of only \u00a33m against their rivals' \u00a315m, it makes financial and electoral sense to focus on holding existing seats and snatching a further 20 which shifted towards the marginal category at the last election.</p> <p>\"This will be a more targeted campaign than ever,\" according to one insider. \"We'll throw everything at 60 or 70 seats - effort, advice, speakers, tours, research.\"</p> <p>Chris Rennard, the Lib Dems' newly-enobled campaign director and chief psephologist, denies any targets cut-off point, but cheerfully admits that \"quite a lot of seats will be told to fight like a byelection\", with particularly energetic flurries of posters, leaflets and the party's usual efforts to portray each contest as a two horse race in an attempt to win tactical votes against the incumbent.</p> <p>Labour voters disappointed at the slow pace of change and Conservatives fearful of their party's rightward drift will both be in Lib Dem sights.</p> <p>In all but a handful of their best-hope seats, the Lib Dems will be chasing a Tory, just as 40 of their 47 seats have the Conservatives in pursuit. Campaigners will pound the pavements repeating the mantra \"remember Romsey\" - the traditionally true-blue Hampshire seat where the Conservatives were ousted by a stay-at-home Tory vote and an intensive Lib Dem campaign overseen by Lord Rennard.</p> <p>The formula could work again if the Tories collapse, although - with the Lib Dems currently polling 15% against 17% in the 1997 election - many believe they will do well to maintain their existing number of seats.</p> <p>Whatever their poll ratings, the Lib Dems boast they are ahead of both rivals in terms of campaign preparations. Party workers have just moved back into their Cowley Street HQ after a comprehensive refurbishment intended to make the wood-panelled, Edwardian building more like Labour's open-plan 21st century command centre down the road at Millbank.</p> <p>The demolition of a few internal walls has created less a war room than a series of large bunkers with freshly painted cornicing, but the party's media, research and policy operations are now at least all gathered in one building at the shiny new Ikea-style pine desks and souped-up computers they will use during the campaign.</p> <p>Lord Rennard, together with his fellow peer and co-campaign leader, Tim Razzall, will sit at adjoining desks in the first floor war room - a floor above the press office - overseeing operations.</p> <p>Lord Rennard, an experienced political enthusiast so immersed in election statistics and strategy he claims to \"get paid for my hobby\", will run the so-called ground war (the constituency battles) and air war (the party's national positioning, leader's tour, advertising and policy launches), assisted by deputy Kate Fox, election planning manager and partner of the party's health spokesman, Nick Harvey. Lord Razzall, a well-to-do lawyer and fixer-about-town referred to by one insider as \"our Charlie Falconer\", will share strategic responsibility, and chair daily 8am press conferences, the earliest of the three main parties, in the old Transport House on nearby Smith Square.</p> <p>Experienced former Ashdown aides Neil Sherlock and Ian Wright will be brought back to work on leader's speeches and attack and rebuttal lines of the day.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy, accompanied by his youthful spin doctor, Daisy Sampson, principal aide Anna Werrin, tour fixer-in-chief Niall Johnston and sometimes his partner, Sarah Gurling, will head each morning for City airport to the waiting plane - where even the air hostesses will be dressed in cheery Lib Dem yellow - before joining his battlebus at the day's campaign destination.</p> <p>The tour schedule, organisers say smugly, is already planned, while the party's manifesto is also completed bar a few post-budget tweaks. Its author, chief policy wonk Richard Grayson, reputedly handed his university essays in similarly early, though several frustrated party figures whisper they would have preferred a later document with more fresh ideas.</p> <p><b> Slogan</b><br></p> <p>The party will campaign under the slogan \"A real chance for real change\", though its posters, designed surprisingly by the hip agency Bank, will appear on the side of campaign vans rather than on costly billboards.</p> <p>Party election broadcasts, meanwhile, will be made with input from the production company Tiger Aspect, whose programme Streetmate sees passers-by being hauled off the street to go on blind dates. Rumours that the same approach will be used to drag apathetic voters to the polling booths are hotly denied.</p>",

With a campaign budget of only \u00a33m against their rivals' \u00a315m, it makes financial and electoral sense to focus on holding existing seats and snatching a further 20 which shifted towards the marginal category at the last election. \"This will be a more targeted campaign than ever,\" according to one insider. \"We'll throw everything at 60 or 70 seats - effort, advice, speakers, tours, research.\" Chris Rennard, the Lib Dems' newly-enobled campaign director and chief psephologist, denies any targets cut-off point, but cheerfully admits that \"quite a lot of seats will be told to fight like a byelection\", with particularly energetic flurries of posters, leaflets and the party's usual efforts to portray each contest as a two horse race in an attempt to win tactical votes against the incumbent. Labour voters disappointed at the slow pace of change and Conservatives fearful of their party's rightward drift will both be in Lib Dem sights. In all but a handful of their best-hope seats, the Lib Dems will be chasing a Tory, just as 40 of their 47 seats have the Conservatives in pursuit. Campaigners will pound the pavements repeating the mantra \"remember Romsey\" - the traditionally true-blue Hampshire seat where the Conservatives were ousted by a stay-at-home Tory vote and an intensive Lib Dem campaign overseen by Lord Rennard. The formula could work again if the Tories collapse, although - with the Lib Dems currently polling 15% against 17% in the 1997 election - many believe they will do well to maintain their existing number of seats. Whatever their poll ratings, the Lib Dems boast they are ahead of both rivals in terms of campaign preparations. Party workers have just moved back into their Cowley Street HQ after a comprehensive refurbishment intended to make the wood-panelled, Edwardian building more like Labour's open-plan 21st century command centre down the road at Millbank. The demolition of a few internal walls has created less a war room than a series of large bunkers with freshly painted cornicing, but the party's media, research and policy operations are now at least all gathered in one building at the shiny new Ikea-style pine desks and souped-up computers they will use during the campaign. Lord Rennard, together with his fellow peer and co-campaign leader, Tim Razzall, will sit at adjoining desks in the first floor war room - a floor above the press office - overseeing operations. Lord Rennard, an experienced political enthusiast so immersed in election statistics and strategy he claims to \"get paid for my hobby\", will run the so-called ground war (the constituency battles) and air war (the party's national positioning, leader's tour, advertising and policy launches), assisted by deputy Kate Fox, election planning manager and partner of the party's health spokesman, Nick Harvey. Lord Razzall, a well-to-do lawyer and fixer-about-town referred to by one insider as \"our Charlie Falconer\", will share strategic responsibility, and chair daily 8am press conferences, the earliest of the three main parties, in the old Transport House on nearby Smith Square. Experienced former Ashdown aides Neil Sherlock and Ian Wright will be brought back to work on leader's speeches and attack and rebuttal lines of the day. Mr Kennedy, accompanied by his youthful spin doctor, Daisy Sampson, principal aide Anna Werrin, tour fixer-in-chief Niall Johnston and sometimes his partner, Sarah Gurling, will head each morning for City airport to the waiting plane - where even the air hostesses will be dressed in cheery Lib Dem yellow - before joining his battlebus at the day's campaign destination. The tour schedule, organisers say smugly, is already planned, while the party's manifesto is also completed bar a few post-budget tweaks. Its author, chief policy wonk Richard Grayson, reputedly handed his university essays in similarly early, though several frustrated party figures whisper they would have preferred a later document with more fresh ideas. Slogan The party will campaign under the slogan \"A real chance for real change\", though its posters, designed surprisingly by the hip agency Bank, will appear on the side of campaign vans rather than on costly billboards. Party election broadcasts, meanwhile, will be made with input from the production company Tiger Aspect, whose programme Streetmate sees passers-by being hauled off the street to go on blind dates. Rumours that the same approach will be used to drag apathetic voters to the polling booths are hotly denied.",

A report by four Commons select committees also said the supply of gun spares to Morocco should not have been allowed and that officials should have told ministers that British arms could have been used by Israeli forces occupying south Lebanon. The report renewed demands for prior parliamentary scrutiny of export licence aplications by British companies. The Foreign Office gave MPs incorrect information about how many export licences were awarded to Zimbabwe over the sale of spares for Hawk aircraft, said the Commons trade and industry, defence, foreign affairs, and international development committees. Zimbabwe forces are involved in the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The MPs also said the government owed a \"debt of honour\" to enact the recommendations in Sir Richard Scott's 1996 report on the arms-to-Iraq affair, which called for proper parliamentary scrutiny of arms exports.

Downing Street has been working on guidance from Railtrack that the network would be back to normal by Easter.

Tony Blair is understood to be furious about Railtrack's broken promise on restoring the network to its pre-Hatfield accident levels. Downing Street realises that the effect will be to make the state of the industry more of an issue during the election campaign. Railtrack said last night that more than 90% of the network would be back to normal by Easter, although some parts would still be under repair over the Easter holiday. The company admitted that more than 100 new sites involving rail cracks had been discovered in addition to those identified in Railtrack's recovery programme after the Hatfield crash in October. Railtrack said 263 speed restrictions were currently in operation, of which 34 were 20mph, 150 were 40 mph and 79 were 60 mph. The company said rail cracks known as \"gauge corner cracking\", the cause of the Hatfield crash, was a well known problem on other rail systems.

Under plans to be unveiled by the prime minister and three of his senior cabinet ministers, Labour will seek to underpin its support in middle England by denying benefits to adult workers and their partners who refuse to take one of the four options offered by the New Deal. Claimants will be forced to take a subsidised job, training, voluntary work or a place on an environmental taskforce, or lose their entitlement to jobseeker's allowance. Up until now the sanctions have only been applied to 18-to 25-year-olds, but the government believes it can sell its hardline message as a result of the first fall in unemployment below 1m for 25 years, com bined with more than 1m unfilled job vacancies. \"The tough approach adopted so far has helped to get 270,000 people into work and as we move into the second stage of the New Deal we need an even tougher regime,\" said a senior Whitehall source. The source said that from now on the government would adopt an \"employment first\" principle, with the unemployed being required to attend an interview with the employment service before signing on for benefit rather than the other way round. \"This will enable them to think about job opportunities and the steps they are ready to take to find one before they get benefits,\" said the source.

Tony Higgins, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, which administers the applications system, told MPs on the Commons education select committee that '\"a head of steam\" was getting behind the new system, which he himself had first recommended back in 1993.

      "bodyText": "The UK publisher Heinemann has pulled out at the last minute from publishing a leading British historian's study of the Holocaust denial libel case, it was disclosed yesterday. The book, Telling Lies About Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the Irving Libel Trial, was put on sale by another publisher in the US two weeks ago. The British edition - due out last week - continues to be advertised on the website of Random House, Heinemann's parent company, as \"a major contribution to our understanding of the Holocaust\". But it was never sent to a printer and is still in typescript. Heinemann has told the author, Richard Evans, professor of modern history at Cambridge University, that it has abandoned the project. The decision apparently sprang from fears that publication might provoke further libel action from David Irving, despite his humiliating defeat last July in a libel action which cost the publisher contesting it, Penguin Books, more than \u00a32m in legal costs, which are still unpaid. Heinemann's climbdown enabled Irving to rejoice on his website yesterday: \"Book has been pulped by British publisher William Heinemann Ltd because it libels Mr Irving\". But the book is now likely to be taken over by another British publisher, Granta, which said last night after reading the typescript that it was \"very enthusiastic and keen to publish\". Gail Lynch, Granta's associate publisher, said: \"We do not see any terrible legal nightmares ahead\". Professor Evans, who has published 16 previous books, most of them on German history, was academic team leader for Penguin's defence in the 32-day high court case which resulted from Irving's libel action against the American author and scholar Deborah Lipstadt. He took two years preparing for the court a 740-page report on the historiography of the Holocaust. At the end of the action, Mr Justice Charles Gray ruled that a book by Professor Lipstadt was justified in branding Mr Irving a Holocaust denier. The judge found that Mr Irv ing was \"an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-semitic and racist; and that he associates with rightwing extremists who promote neo-Nazism. \"The content of his speeches and interviews often displays a distinctly pro-Nazi and anti-Jewish bias. He makes surprising and often unfounded assertions about the Nazi regime which tend to exonerate the Nazis for the appalling atrocities which they inflicted on the Jews. \"In my view, the defendants have established that Irving has a political agenda. It is one which, it is legitimate to infer, disposes him, where he deems it necessary, to manipulate the historical record in order to make it conform with his political beliefs.\" The ruling left Irving facing bankruptcy with a total of \u00a32.5m in defence costs. Soon after the ruling, Heinemann commissioned Prof Evans's book. The deal was negotiated by Ravi Merchandani, the company's publishing director, previously a leading editor at Penguin. Random House's website advertisement for the book stresses the authority of Prof Evans's report for the court case. It says his book \"unpacks the issues raised by the trial, from the career of Mr Irving and the exposure of his methods, to the wider question of the preservation of the cultural memory of the Holocaust - and the social and cultural functions of the historian in society\". A review on the US website Amazon.com of the American version, published by Basic Books, calls the work \"a cogent and deeply informed study in the nature of historical interpretation\".

      "trailText": "<p>The scheme will see councils take over the funding, planning and commissioning of all housing-related support services from housing benefit and the Housing Corporation.<strong>David Batty</strong> explains.</p>",
      "byline": "David Batty",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br> Under Supporting People councils will take over the funding, planning and commissioning of all housing-related support services from housing benefit and the Housing Corporation. This includes support for the elderly, people with mental health problems or learning difficulties, physical disabilities and chronic illnesses, rough sleepers, ex-offenders, drug and alcohol users, victims of domestic violence and young care leavers. </p> <p><strong>Why change the system?</strong><br> Housing-related support has traditionally been funded from a variety of sources, chiefly housing benefit, as well as the Housing Corporation, the Department of Health and the Home Office. But housing benefit was never meant to fund care services and has come under increasing scrutiny. A 1997 court ruling stated it could only pay for such support in limited situations. This threatened the viability of hundreds of supported housing projects. The government then introduced a transition scheme, but from 2003 a single Supporting People grant will replace the various existing funding streams. </p> <p><strong>What is the aim of the scheme?</strong><br> The main aim of Supporting People is to provide service users with help tailored to their individual needs rather than slotting them into existing services. It will end the link between support and housing tenure. The current system is biased towards supported housing, hostels and council accommodation. This might mean older people who need basic support having to go into a home to get help. But under the new arrangements, they will have access to visiting support services to enable them to remain in their own homes. People leaving institutions (such as prison) or who have been homeless will also get help to set up home. Local authorities will identify users' needs and commission appropriate services through local Supporting People strategies.</p> <p><strong>How will this be achieved?</strong><br> Local authorities will review and commission all housing-related support services on a regular cycle - every two or three years - starting between 2003 and 2006. It is anticipated that Supporting People funds will eventually be allocated under a national formula based on indicators of local need. A cross-authority fund will meet the needs of groups such as transient rough sleepers and women escaping domestic violence, who have previously missed out on support. Existing users of sheltered housing and short-term users of schemes such as women's refuges will be exempt from charges but new clients will have to pay for long-term services.</p> <p><strong>Who is involved in the scheme?</strong><br> Supporting People strategies will be developed by a partnership of housing and social services departments, encompassing district and county authorities, together with health, probation services, users, and providers. Local authorities' plans must link in with wider strategies in health, social services, housing and neighbourhood renewal and community safety. These include health improvement plans, joint investment plans and the national service framework for older people. The aim is to establish joint commissioning and funding of services with the NHS, leading to joined-up care packages that provide everyday support alongside specialist care. </p> <p><strong>What preparations must councils make?</strong><br> The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has set an action plan for local authorities with targets to achieve by April 2003. The government has set aside \u00a3138m over three years to cover administration costs, with the first money available from April 1.</p> <p>By March 2002, councils must have mapped all local support services. This includes those provided by the council itself, registered social landlords, voluntary sector agencies, NHS trusts, private sector organisations and landlords and the probation service. This mapping exercise must identify local users' needs and gaps in current services. Authorities will also need to discuss potential changes with service providers.</p> <p>By August 2002, they should have drawn up a shadow Supporting People strategy with their partners. A list of all existing providers should be ready by November 2002 and the value of the grant to be paid to each from April 2003. The first Supporting People strategies will be produced in 2003.</p> <p><strong>What are the potential problems?</strong><br> Many in local authorities, housing associations and social care broadly welcome the aims of Supporting People but fear the pot of money available will be too small leading to cuts in services.

      "bodyText": "What is it? Under Supporting People councils will take over the funding, planning and commissioning of all housing-related support services from housing benefit and the Housing Corporation. This includes support for the elderly, people with mental health problems or learning difficulties, physical disabilities and chronic illnesses, rough sleepers, ex-offenders, drug and alcohol users, victims of domestic violence and young care leavers. Why change the system? Housing-related support has traditionally been funded from a variety of sources, chiefly housing benefit, as well as the Housing Corporation, the Department of Health and the Home Office. But housing benefit was never meant to fund care services and has come under increasing scrutiny. A 1997 court ruling stated it could only pay for such support in limited situations. This threatened the viability of hundreds of supported housing projects. The government then introduced a transition scheme, but from 2003 a single Supporting People grant will replace the various existing funding streams. What is the aim of the scheme? The main aim of Supporting People is to provide service users with help tailored to their individual needs rather than slotting them into existing services. It will end the link between support and housing tenure. The current system is biased towards supported housing, hostels and council accommodation. This might mean older people who need basic support having to go into a home to get help. But under the new arrangements, they will have access to visiting support services to enable them to remain in their own homes. People leaving institutions (such as prison) or who have been homeless will also get help to set up home. Local authorities will identify users' needs and commission appropriate services through local Supporting People strategies. How will this be achieved? Local authorities will review and commission all housing-related support services on a regular cycle - every two or three years - starting between 2003 and 2006. It is anticipated that Supporting People funds will eventually be allocated under a national formula based on indicators of local need. A cross-authority fund will meet the needs of groups such as transient rough sleepers and women escaping domestic violence, who have previously missed out on support. Existing users of sheltered housing and short-term users of schemes such as women's refuges will be exempt from charges but new clients will have to pay for long-term services. Who is involved in the scheme? Supporting People strategies will be developed by a partnership of housing and social services departments, encompassing district and county authorities, together with health, probation services, users, and providers. Local authorities' plans must link in with wider strategies in health, social services, housing and neighbourhood renewal and community safety. These include health improvement plans, joint investment plans and the national service framework for older people. The aim is to establish joint commissioning and funding of services with the NHS, leading to joined-up care packages that provide everyday support alongside specialist care. What preparations must councils make? The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has set an action plan for local authorities with targets to achieve by April 2003. The government has set aside \u00a3138m over three years to cover administration costs, with the first money available from April 1. By March 2002, councils must have mapped all local support services. This includes those provided by the council itself, registered social landlords, voluntary sector agencies, NHS trusts, private sector organisations and landlords and the probation service. This mapping exercise must identify local users' needs and gaps in current services. Authorities will also need to discuss potential changes with service providers. By August 2002, they should have drawn up a shadow Supporting People strategy with their partners. A list of all existing providers should be ready by November 2002 and the value of the grant to be paid to each from April 2003. The first Supporting People strategies will be produced in 2003. What are the potential problems? Many in local authorities, housing associations and social care broadly welcome the aims of Supporting People but fear the pot of money available will be too small leading to cuts in services. Changes to the funding system have already begun with the introduction of transitional housing benefit. Providers now have to state what proportion of rent pays for housing costs and what proportion pays for support costs. The funds councils receive for Supporting People will partly be based on these local support costs. But Fahmeeda Gill, policy officer of the National Housing Federation, warns that providers are underestimating their support costs to maximise the amount of housing benefit they continue to receive after 2003. \"This means the government will underestimate the total cost of support, leading to a shortfall in funding.\" Ms Gill also warned that the competitive nature of the scheme could squeeze smaller voluntary services. \"We're moving from a system based on rights - housing benefit - to one based on grants, where you bid for funds. But smaller providers lack the resources to prepare bids.\" She wants greater awareness of the changes as well. \"It's one thing to tell existing tenants but another to tell the wider population who could benefit from Supporting People. We fear private tenants are not being informed, which will lead to ethnic minorities in particular missing out on support.\" Chris Hampson, head of policy and strategy at London housing association Look Ahead, warned it would be difficult to identify unmet needs, such as people sleeping on friends' floors.

On his list were The Archers, the novels of Anthony Trollope and Patrick O'Brian, and the early vinyl recording of Jazz saxophonist Charlie ('Bird') Parker. Also included on Sir Christopher's list was an item that, no doubt, took most, if not all, of those listening to his words by surprise: viz, \"the away games of Plymouth Argyle\". Moreover, bemusement was surely the reaction of most of those who have subsequently read Sir Christopher's words (which were reported in the Diary section of The Times on March 6 2000, p 20). This last item on Sir Christopher's list should, however, come as less of a surprise to Plymouth Argyle's travelling supporters. </p> <p>When Argyle's supporters travel around the country, they typically do so with a particular self-understanding. They view themselves as the representatives of a distinctive part of the country - a fact that is made plain in a repertoire of songs that are celebrations of their distinct south-western identity. Moreover, these songs are sung with a degree of intensity that is matched by the supporters of only a minority of clubs in the professional game. One such club is Newcastle United. When Newcastle's supporters sing \"Toon, Toon, Black and White Army\" or \"The Blaydon Races\", they are doing so in order to celebrate a distinct (city-wide) form of North Eastern life. </p> <p>So what inspires such intensity in the supporter's of Newcastle and Argyle? The beginnings of an answer can be found in the assumption that a particular city (Newcastle) or a particular region (the south-west) is intrinsically valuable and, hence, worthy of celebration. But, in order to answer the above question satisfactorily, more is surely needed. And it can, perhaps, be found, in the (more or less conscious) perception that ours is a society and an age in which distinct regional (and other) identities are being rapidly eroded. We live, after all, at a time when, among other things, the homogenising forces of global capital exert an unprecedented level of influence. Consider, for example, the films that are served up for our entertainment in multiplex cinema chains that circle the planet. In both Plymouth and Newcastle, this fare simultaneously inducts us into a global mega-culture and lures us away from that which makes our region or city distinctive and, as such, a site of (active) cultural production rather than (passive) cultural reproduction.</p> <p>If the above is broadly correct, then the intense support Argyle enjoy away from home might be seen as a defence of a particular and valued culture. And if this is indeed the case, then it is a state of affairs that has great practical significance for both the club and people in the south-west. The club could become a regional beacon - an institution that gives expression to and serves to secure a valued regional identity. This is, of course, not the most obvious task for a football club (centrally concerned with success on the pitch) to undertake. But it is one that could encourage growth in the ranks of Argyle's Green Army. For what is on offer is intensity of a sort not to be found in any multiplex.

It means an agonising weekend ahead for journalists - letters from editorial director Paul Ashford are not being posted out until tomorrow. Figures have not been confirmed, but a crunch meeting with the journalists' union has been scheduled for tomorrow morning. In a meeting at the Express's Ludgate House canteen, journalists were told by NUJ's Jeremy Dear that he and general secretary John Foster have been called in to be told of the paper's redundancy plans. Up to now, executives at the company have privately confirmed that between 50 and 100 redundancies would be made. But during the meeting, Mr Dear said he believed the final figure could be as high as 170. However, well-informed sources say the figure is likely to be closer to 130. The NUJ said letters had already gone out to staff by second class post detailing the redundancy plans. It is believed that new Express owner Richard Desmond also wants to cut holiday allowance by two weeks a year. This would affect all remaining journalists who are normally on six weeks' paid leave. In what insiders say was a packed, emotional meeting in the Express Newspapers canteen, a unanimous motion was passed by 200 staff to resist cuts \"with all means at its disposal\". The motion states: \"Despite promises to spend 'whatever it takes' to 'restore the papers to their rightful position', reports indicate that plans are being drawn up to axe more than 100 jobs in the editorial departments. \"This chapel believes that such a redundancy programme would harm the quality of the paper and result in worse terms and conditions for other staff.\" Mr Dear warned staff that Express Newspapers management was pressuring journalists to accept new contracts from the parent company Northern &amp; Shell, which would see them moving from six to four weeks paid holiday a year. Under current employment law, employers must agree to a 90-day consultation period for plans involving any number of redundancies over 100. The Express made over 60 marketing, sales and administrative staff redundant after Richard Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell bought the paper late last year. Mr Desmond's last round of redundancies met with widespread condemnation, not least from former Express editor Rosie Boycott, who chided him for \"heavy-handed\" management techniques.",

The Future Foundation think tank suggests that people respond to causes that touch or inspire them, and that what donors want is to help something or someone specific. Its criticisms of the Getting Britain Giving campaign focus on whether a drive to create a generic giving campaign will be a sufficient incentive to get people to give more. The Charities Aid Foundation will however shortly launch a report stating that there is already a noticeable increase in charitable giving through payrolls since the government's new incentives took effect last April. CAF points out that payroll-giving has been a highly effective fundraiser for some local charities that have made direct, personal contact with employees and companies in their area. \u0095 Payroll giving helpline 0845 604 9000",

      "bodyText": "The leaders of the three main political parties will today sign a pledge vowing not to \"use the race card\" during the general election campaign. The historic promise will see the prime minister, Conservative leader William Hague and Liberal Democrat chief Charles Kennedy agree to discipline any activist or candidate who acts in a way \"likely to stir up racial prejudice.\" The three party chiefs will also be joined by representatives of Plaid Cymru and the SNP. The scheme - organised by the commission for racial equality - is designed to take race out of the election campaign, expected to be called in the next fortnight for a May 3 polling day. The move comes despite high-profile criticism of the Tory leader William Hague for a speech in Harrogate promising to \"give you your country back.\" And he claimed Britain under a Labour second term would become a \"foreign land.\" The speech - to Conservative party activists - was criticised by even rightwing allies in the press like The Sun and The Times. Former liberal democrat leader Paddy Ashdown compared it to Enoch Powell's \"rivers of blood\" speech, and retiring conservative MP Michael Heseltine admitted it made him think twice about voting conservative. Plaid Cymru has also been criticised recently for an outspoken attack on English people living in Wales. The leaders will sign the pledge card at a ceremony in the House of Commons after prime minister's questions this afternoon.

The new post will look after the affairs of former service personnel from all wars and across all departments of government, Mr Blair told the Commons at prime minister's questions. The minister, who will work out of the Ministry for Defence, is the current under-secretary of state for Defence, Dr Lewis Moonie. It is expected the new minister will tackle issues ranging from widow's pensions to the ongoing saga of gulf war syndrome. A spokesman for the MOD said: \"It is time veterans were properly recognised for the great sacrifice they have made. The nation owes it to them to give them what they need - that is exactly what the new minister will do.\" The prime minister did not reveal exactly when the new minister will take up his responsibilities, but it is expected to be after the election. No mention was made of the election during the 30-minute grilling of Tony Blair this afternoon. Instead, in one of the last sessions before a general election is expected to be called, all three party leaders debated the foot and mouth epidemic. Tory leader William Hague said the country was \"in the grip of a national crisis\" and called for the exemption from rates of tourism businesses worst hit by the outbreak. Mr Blair said ministers would look at \"all the measures necessary to help them\" and promised a statement on the government's response to the mounting crisis tomorrow. The government is examining ways of stepping up the slaughter of animals in areas most affected by foot and mouth disease, the prime minister told the Commons. Mr Blair added : \"We are using already some final year veterinary students and retirees are important as well.

      "body": "<p>Frank Furedi is not a relaxed parent. He can be laid-back about some things: his five-year-old son, Jacob, is encouraged to play in the woods near their family home, and Furedi hopes he will soon be able to cycle to school. But when it comes to illness, Furedi frets. He worries about his son's health. He can even quote you Jacob's temperature when he was last poorly. In short, he is paranoid - in common with all parents, he maintains. </p> <p>\"We all have our vulnerabilities, our areas of concern, our fears,\" says Furedi. \"We all have something that can be played on and opened up, and which then becomes the basis of fear in our parenting.\" </p> <p>So, Furedi is on a mission: he wants to make us aware of our paranoia so we can all cool it and be a bit more rational where looking after our kids is concerned. Thus the message of his new book, Paranoid Parenting, is: stop listening to the \"experts\"; tear up the handbook; and follow your instincts - where your child is concerned, you know best. </p> <p>Of course, there is a certain paradox to all this, since Furedi himself is a type of expert - a sociologist at the University of Kent - and before you follow his advice never to read another parenting book, he would love you to buy this one. His ideas were formed, he says, after he became a father at the relatively advanced age of 48, and discovered that parenting had changed rather a lot in the decades between his own boyhood and that of his son. </p> <p>In particular, what he noticed was that children were no longer left to their own devices. He describes it as a \"colonisation\" of the world of children by adults. As a consequence, he says, adults not only inhabit but control the lives of children to an alarming and unhealthy extent. </p> <p>For Furedi, whose 1997 book The Culture of Fear examined the way risk is perceived in society, the most obvious manifestation of this control centres on fears about children's safety. The real risks, he argues, are magnified by irrational fears; and so kids' freedom and creativity are being limited. While Jacob is encouraged to play outside the Furedis' home in Faversham, Kent, many children are kept indoors - out of harm's way. But the harm, Furedi would have us believe, is largely imagined: yes, we read a lot about child abduction, murder and paedophilia, but the risks to our own children from these evils are minuscule. Our fears are fed by study after alarm-bell-ringing study alerting us to this or that childhood danger. Furedi disputes the idea that most of these studies originate in universities like his own. In fact, he says, many are market research reports masquerading as more serious analyses. The media are the villains of the piece, and here there is a whiff of Furedi's past as a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, whose magazine Living Marxism had an unerring instinct for controversy and an abiding contempt for the \"bourgeois press\". But the result, he says, is a generation of parents who believe that their children are at real risk, and who are overreacting in their efforts to protect them. </p> <p>\"When I ask people why they limit their children's activities in a particular way,\" says Furedi, \"they always say, 'I couldn't live with myself if anything happened.' In other words, they're talking about themselves, not about their children.\" </p> <p>All this worry, he believes, is casting a shadow over family life. Take cot death, for example. Furedi says that when he and his wife, Ann, were expecting Jacob, the risks of cot death were often mentioned. \"Every mother I know admits to having worried at some point that their child is at risk,\" he notes. \"It's emblematic of the campaign that we've created.\" </p> <p>The effect of this climate of fear on parents is exacerbated by the fact that more and more is expected from them, argues Furedi: \"Take education: today's parents are expected to be amateur teachers, involved in every part of their children's schoolwork. It's certainly not enough to leave it to the school. I think that degrades education, because it means politicians can ignore the problems of schools. </p> <p>\"What I'm saying is that we've established this culture in which parents have a direct sense of responsibility for everything that happens to their children. What this means is that we've lost our autonomy.\" </p> <p>Furedi thinks that because we now feel we have to take responsibility for every part of our children's lives, we take every threat to their safety too seriously. \"It's not worth altering your behaviour and being on red alert for what are relatively small risks,\" he maintains. \"We've got to accept that life contains risks and it's far better to be aware of them than to let them enslave our lives.\" </p> <p>The counter-argument to all this is that today's parents are more knowledgeable about certain areas of parenting and more involved in their children's lives than parents in the 50s and 60s. But Furedi is having none of this. First, he says, it is naive to argue that the information we are being fed about, say, health risks in pregnancy is widening our choice or improving our parenting; in fact they often lead to enforced conformity. \"Take the US, where in some areas pregnant women can be arrested for drinking in public,\" he says. \"What begins as advice ends up as coercion.\" </p> <p>Furedi concedes that there may be a positive aspect to parents being more involved in the lives of their children, but adds that: \"The danger is, it becomes compulsive. What starts as involvement becomes this infinite process, and you lose the ability to draw a line between what your children should be doing on their own and what adults should be doing.\" </p> <p>Furedi describes his own childhood - he grew up in Hungary in the 50s - as a happy one, despite a lack of material wealth and a father who had to work a 60-hour week. Interestingly, he admits that his mother, who had survived imprisonment in a concentration camp, was overprotective. His own desire to be hands-off about Jacob's upbringing, and to persuade the rest of us to take the same approach, is at least partly a reaction to that. \"Our own parents probably did a reasonable job given the constraints they were under, and I don't think it's helpful to criticise them.\" </p> <p>Furedi denies that he is harking back to a golden age when parents left their kids to get on with growing up and did not meddle so much (although it is difficult to dismiss entirely the thought that, somewhere inside, he does believe that today's kids are worse off than previous generations). What he says is that there is no model from the past for good practice in parenting: every generation has to deal with the difficulties around it and do the best it can. But the bottom line is: if we stopped trying so hard, we would make a better job of bringing up our kids - and if we ignored most of the advice we are bombarded with, we would do a better job still. </p> <p>\u0095 Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi is published by Penguin Press.

What he says is that there is no model from the past for good practice in parenting: every generation has to deal with the difficulties around it and do the best it can. But the bottom line is: if we stopped trying so hard, we would make a better job of bringing up our kids - and if we ignored most of the advice we are bombarded with, we would do a better job still. \u0095 Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi is published by Penguin Press.

The research has found that those who didn't work increased the chances of their children getting one A-level by 12%, while those who worked part time increased their children's chances by 6%. </p> <p>All research needs to be treated with scepticism. This was a study of 1,236 people born in the 1970s, when times were very different. Working mothers were rarer; high-quality daycare was almost nonexistent; and our knowledge of the psychological development of under-fives was scant. There were no early music classes, no dance or drama workshops, and few nursery schools with Montessori equipment encouraging the basic learning skills that we take for granted today. </p> <p>A great deal happens in children's lives between the ages of five and 18 that can affect their attitudes to education; without knowing their individual life stories, it is hard to tell surely whether they would have dropped out or failed A-levels anyway. It is obvious, but no less striking, that the children of educated working mothers stood a better chance of getting A-levels than those lower down the social scale. </p> <p>John Ermisch, co-author of the report with Marco Francesconi at the University of Essex, agrees that other factors inevitably influence educational outcomes: \"There are a lot of other things that you can't control, but I was a bit surprised by the size of the difference. My preconception was that what parents did with their time when they were not working would muddy the waters so much that the difference would be less.\" </p> <p>For every research paper that suggests working motherhood damages children, others indicate more positive effects on the social and cognitive development of children. At the Institute of Child Health, Ian Roberts con ducted a systematic review of childcare research and found that, on balance, it was good for children, provided they were in high-quality care. A trained nursery worker, able to stimulate and excite a child with a wide variety of educational toys for part of the day, is likely to be of far greater benefit than a bored or preoccupied full-time mother who plonks the baby in front of the television for hours at a time. Other research indicates that stay-at-home mothers are more likely to be depressed and feel isolated. Depressed mothers interact far less with their babies, which is in itself a developmental downer. </p> <p>When this research is put into the wider context of what is happening within education, whether or not mothers are working must surely be secondary to what is happening within our schools. Educational standards are higher than ever for those children who manage to stay the course, and unprecedented numbers of young people now go on to some form of higher education. But, at the other end of the scale, rising numbers of disaffected children fail to see the point of getting an education at all when both of their parents are unemployed (presumably with their mother at home) and they live on run-down estates where the schools struggle to buy books and keep their charges in the classroom. </p> <p>From pre-conception onwards, parents are bombarded with research that centres on the welfare of their children and the way that parents can unwittingly damage them. At best, parents feel confused about the implications. Most, however, feel a great deal worse. They feel they are to blame for every minor mistake, for eating the wrong foods or living with too much stress while pregnant, guilty about opting for a caesarean rather than a natural birth, guilty about preferring reading the newspaper to engaging in vigorous interactive play with their toddler, and guilty about going back to work when most have little choice but to do so. </p> <p>Yet other research has shown that, despite our guilt (or perhaps because of it), parents today are spending more \"quality time\" with their children than ever before. Jonathan Gershuny - by coincidence, a sociologist also based at the University of Essex - found that even full-time employed women in 1995 devoted more time to childcare than non-employed mothers did in 1961. Meanwhile, as Ermisch is willing to concede, we still do not have a systematic overview of what constitutes good childcare: \"Society can do a great deal to make it easier for mothers to stay at home more when their children are small, but I'm less clear about what the individual can do. Psychologists don't have the answers either on the best types of childcare; the jury is still out on that.\" </p> <p>Clearly, we could do with more research.</p>",

Its conclusion? \"Babies wreck relationships and working life.\" In one giddy hurdle, the horror leaps from the anecdotal to the official. </p> <p>So, according to Mother &amp; Baby magazine's Sleep Survey 2001, 81% of mothers say lack of sleep puts immense strain on their relationship, while 88% of those who have to return to work say they feel \"fed up, exhausted, and pulled in too many directions\". More than half of the 2,000 mothers questioned claimed that tiredness leaves them in a \"state of despair and desperation\". During the first four months, mothers get an average of less than four hours' sleep. </p> <p>Yes! Others have suffered too. I'm so glad. Because, let's face it, the world is full of smug liars whose little Ellas and Milos \"sleep through\" from nine weeks of age. Rubbish! When questioned aggressively, nay hysterically by me, the truth starts leaking out. It seems that \"sleeping through\", that stock favourite in the specialist field of mother-and-baby lingo - along with \"falling pregnant\" and \"on solids\" - can mean three hours. That 2.30am \"drink\" - of boiled water? Of rosehip tea? - is, in fact, milk. Ah, right. So young Morpheus sleeps through with a feed or two before waking at 5am. Otherwise known as not sleeping through at all. </p> <p>You'd think the liars would want to bond over eyelash tics, sobbing fits and exhaustion-induced nausea, for example - like one's more human and evolved friends. But no. The prodigy competition is kickstarted in the womb, you understand. </p> <p>Nevertheless, I felt I had given birth to a hyperactive insomniac. After a pregnancy spent eating organic broccoli, I landed myself a tartrazine kid. Nowadays, the lad is a genius in the art of slumber, but for the first six-and-a-half months it was not so. My own set of figurelets, my own two-person survey, is etched with horrible accuracy upon my memory. For the first three weeks he usually stayed awake all night. He then bawled, grizzled and whimpered between most two-hourly feeds. Upon learning to doze with a lactose hit, he still woke with the same promptitude. All day. All night. And then suddenly - no gentle gradation in his little sleep graph - he slept all night. </p> <p>So indeed, Mother &amp; Baby, sleep deprivation does rather tend to wreck one's life. \"It's used as a form of torture, you know,\" people would inform me brightly as I sat there in a grey and slack-jawed haze. Yes, yes, as if we didn't all bloody know that. </p> <p>My partner and I were actually united in shock. But we felt as though we walked side by side without touching through a strange fog-filled land. A land of separate beds, breast pumps, expressed bottle shifts, cot-death fixation, \u00a340-worth of sleep manuals, rare sex and a physical obstacle between us at all times. </p> <p>Early on, the insomnia carries a strange kick. Two months in, I was on a feverish high: buzzy, chocolate-addicted and oestrogen-flushed. Then the crash comes. At four months, we dropped our baby. The paediatrician in A&amp;E pointed a strict finger at me and said: \"He's all right; you're not.\" </p> <p>We read Dr Richard Ferber with the piteous optimism of the zealot; we tried sleep training, formula bottles, white noise and dark curtains. Later, it's so easy to forget. I recall it only by the physical symptoms: black spots in front of the eyes, faint hallucinations, the fear of actual vomiting, the whole body a vibrating, empty chamber of panic. Your head is composed of shifting sand. Your mind is grainy, buzzing, separated from the world by a layer of scum. It functions only for the obsessive calculation of available sleep. </p> <p>Older parents helpfully explain that one must let babies cry all night in their knitted bootees. Yet abject expertise in cot-death prevention forbids one from carting the cot next door. Work becomes torment. Sleep becomes sex, food, love, soap operas all rolled into one - the only need. </p> <p>What we failed to understand was: a) there's little you can do to make the buggers sleep before they're ready; and b) it gets better. </p> <p>I'm happy to establish that our hyperactive insomniac was, in fact, a fairly normal hyperactive insomniac. But, to all those triumphant bastards who made us feel like weeping freaks, I'd just like to say that he now sleeps 11 hours a night. Ha ha ha.</p>",

A land of separate beds, breast pumps, expressed bottle shifts, cot-death fixation, \u00a340-worth of sleep manuals, rare sex and a physical obstacle between us at all times. Early on, the insomnia carries a strange kick. Two months in, I was on a feverish high: buzzy, chocolate-addicted and oestrogen-flushed. Then the crash comes. At four months, we dropped our baby. The paediatrician in A&amp;E pointed a strict finger at me and said: \"He's all right; you're not.\" We read Dr Richard Ferber with the piteous optimism of the zealot; we tried sleep training, formula bottles, white noise and dark curtains. Later, it's so easy to forget. I recall it only by the physical symptoms: black spots in front of the eyes, faint hallucinations, the fear of actual vomiting, the whole body a vibrating, empty chamber of panic. Your head is composed of shifting sand. Your mind is grainy, buzzing, separated from the world by a layer of scum. It functions only for the obsessive calculation of available sleep. Older parents helpfully explain that one must let babies cry all night in their knitted bootees. Yet abject expertise in cot-death prevention forbids one from carting the cot next door. Work becomes torment. Sleep becomes sex, food, love, soap operas all rolled into one - the only need. What we failed to understand was: a) there's little you can do to make the buggers sleep before they're ready; and b) it gets better. I'm happy to establish that our hyperactive insomniac was, in fact, a fairly normal hyperactive insomniac. But, to all those triumphant bastards who made us feel like weeping freaks, I'd just like to say that he now sleeps 11 hours a night. Ha ha ha.",

      "body": "<p>\"Posh blasts Becks over Brooklyn.\" Never mind foot and mouth, train crashes or the impending election - this was the Sunday Mirror's front-page banner headline a couple of weekends ago. It came above a fanciful tale - sourced from that great standby of desperate newsdesks, \"a close friend\" - of an alleged transatlantic mobile-phone row between Britain's unofficial royal couple over childcare. While his wife was in America on a promotional tour, David Beckham had apparently spent a day off playing paintball with his chums, leaving the boy Brooklyn in the care of his mother-in-law. Posh was, so the story claimed, furious, and angrily reminded him of his parental priorities. The close friend concluded that tension would be high on her return as the couple prepared for the biggest social event of their calendar year: their boy's birthday party. </p> <p>Phew! We're lucky that this in-depth piece of investigative reporting didn't gain wider currency. Otherwise it might well have affected the survey of men, conducted this week by Norwich Union Healthcare, which found that Beckham is their ideal role model as a first-time father. Becks triumphed in the poll, which also reckoned Liam Gallagher to be the worst kind of dad. This has been a bad week for the Oasis singer and polls: GQ magazine's April edition pronounced Gallagher the worst-dressed man in Britain, which was a rather dramatic fall from grace since he was voted the best-dressed man last year. </p> <p>Any poll involving celebrity is generally about as scientifically well-founded as Nick Brown's assertion that the foot and mouth crisis is under control. Most respondents simply mention the first star that enters their head. Thus Beckham and Gallagher would be certain to feature in any survey, from \"Which celebrity is most likely to be a closet homosexual?\" to \"If a plane of celebrities crashed on a desert island, who would be the first to suggest cannibalism?\" </p> <p>Even so, the news that Beckham is regarded as a good dad has some resonance with the truth. Despite his alleged paintballing lapse, every image we have of him and his son together is positive. His is a very tactile approach to the boy: photographs reveal him forever hugging and kissing his son, film footage shows him breaking into a broad smile and lifting the boy on to his shoulders whenever Brooklyn waddles into view. What's more, he has the lad's name tattooed across the small of his back - a space that is going to get very crowded if he has as many children as he has threatened. And while media manipulation may well be involved here, you could not fake the easy familiarity that he exhibits towards his child. He looks every inch a natural dad. </p> <p>Besides, it is worth remembering that this is a man who has put his child before his work, to the point of getting himself a bollocking from the boss. Back in December 1999, Beckham failed to turn up for training at Manchester United because, he said, his son was ill. His manager, Sir Alex Ferguson - not a man, you suspect, who would have stayed at home when young Darren was running a temperature - was apoplectic. Beckham, he said, had to refocus his priorities: work was what counted; everything else had to fall in behind it. Footballers, after all, are not exactly bereft of free time in which to bond with their offspring. Many newspaper columnists - not all of them women - sided with Beckham. They applauded his behaviour and welcomed the way it opened up a debate about why it is always the female half of a working couple who is obliged to take time off when their child is ill. It was an argument that many stuck to even when the press printed photographs of Victoria Beckham out clothes-shopping in London on the very day the boy was snuffly. </p> <p>The battle of Brooklyn's snotty nose was weighed down by much baggage, not least Ferguson's Presbyterian disdain for the flimflam of his player's celebrity lifestyle. It was as much about wasting time and energy on OK! photo shoots as it was about nappy-changing. The row nevertheless highlighted a generational gap in football over the issue of children. Ferguson is the first to admit that he did not watch his own three sons grow up. He left the day-to-day parenting duties to his wife, Cathy. That's what men of his generation and background did: they devoted themselves to their career, and filed everything else under \"women's work\". Rarely, if ever, did the children intrude on their ambitions. </p> <p>But for the next generation in football, kids have become a badge of pride, to be celebrated and shown off. At last year's FA Cup final, Chelsea's Dennis Wise became the first captain in history to lift the trophy in one hand while holding his baby in the other. He had carried his infant son, Henry, up the steps to Wembley's royal box, wanting the lad to be there with him at the big moment. In his Chelsea shirt with the word Daddy embroidered across the shoulders, the boy Wise looked sweet, if a little bemused. No doubt he will look back on his first final like many a participant and claim it passed him all by. Logged deep in his memory bank, it will appear to be no more than routine: had bottle, filled nappy, dad lifted FA Cup. </p> <p>Yet many commentators thought Wise's gesture an affront to the dignity of the FA Cup. You couldn't help feeling, listening to the grouches complaining, that what they were most worried about was the unholy intrusion of womanly things - you know, babies - into a male preserve. For the rest of us, it showed a somewhat unexpected side of a man generally renowned for his thuggishness. If anything, Wise went up in the country's collective estimation. </p> <p>And last weekend, another psychological victory was won for the new footballing dad. The Wycombe Wanderers player Steve Brown celebrated the goal that took his lowly club to the semifinal of the FA Cup by removing his shirt. He was promptly sent off. But what made the referee's action not so much petty as heartless was that Brown had taken off his shirt to reveal, scrawled on his vest, a message to his critically ill 15-month-old-son, Maxwell. \"Wyked\", the Sun's front page called the incident. All day on Monday, Brown conducted back-to-back media interviews about it. And how did he choose to celebrate his new-found celebrity? With the toddler happily gurgling on his knee. </p> <p>Beckham is going to have to pull off some coup to retain his position as number-one role-model dad with that sort of competition.

      "body": "<p>Just over 10 years ago Mandy Asquith was going through a tough time. She had recently been divorced and was bringing up children on her own. She felt unable to work full time because of her childcare commitments. Even so, she really wanted to do something that would get her out of the house and stop her from feeling isolated.</p> <p>One day when she was visiting the doctor she noticed a poster up on the noticeboard in the surgery. It was from an organisation called Wakefield Riding for the Disabled. It needed volunteers to help out.</p> <p>Ms Asquith had done a fair bit of horse riding in the past. As she had the necessary experience with horses she thought, \"Why not?\". She was initially asked to commit only one hour a week and and has not looked back since.</p> <p>\"The one hour soon become 37 or 38 hours a week. I was quickly roped in,\" she explained. \"At first I was only paid \u00a32O a week. Any more and I would have lost my benefit. But for the last five years I've been paid full time as a manager.\"</p> <p>\"The job's great. I really loved it. The only trouble was I did not have any training, and certainly none in management issues.\" Ms Asquith had two staff to manage and up to eight volunteers at any one time.</p> <p>There was too much for her to do on a day-to-day basis. \"Working with horses means that you can never predict exactly what is going to happen. Even so, the horse side of things was fine, and the riders were enjoying the riding. But I still got the sense that we were always managing a crisis. We were working one day to the next. We never really got anywhere because I did not have time to plan ahead.\"</p> <p>Ms Asquith was impressed by the adviser from the Project 2001 team who came to see her. </p> <p>\"She was really great. It was obvious to her that if the organisation was ever going to move forward and grow, I needed to go on management training,\" she says. \"She suggested I took an NVQ in management, which a Project 2001 grant would pay for.\"</p> <p>Ms Asquith had to travel from Wakefield to York one afternoon a month to take the course which was run by the Advisory Council for Voluntary Organisations. She enjoyed it tremendously. </p> <p>\"It was so inspirational. Most of the people on the course were like me. They were women with kids. It was brilliant to know there were others dealing with the same problems and same issues. \"</p> <p>Now Ms Asquith has an NVQ4 in management. Both she and Wakefield Riders for the Disabled have benefited from this training.</p> <p>\"It is now much easier to spot problems early and deal with them before they become a big issue. It has also made me much more confident in my abilities. We have also been able to improve our communications with other local organisations. This has raised our profile locally.\"</p> <p>Ms Asquith stressed that her training has not just benefited her personally, but has helped the whole organisation to develop. \"I've learnt to plan and prioritise and concentrate on the key issues for the organisation. Things are now really happening. We have produced a handbook which shows how to train people who want to be riding instructors for disabled people. We have distributed this guide to 600 groups. It is now going to be used nationally.\"</p> <p>Ms Asquith herself has volunteered to be a mentor for other management trainees from the voluntary sector.</p> <p>\"I learnt a lot from other people when I was on the course. Hopefully, I can now pass on my experience to help others.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Just over 10 years ago Mandy Asquith was going through a tough time. She had recently been divorced and was bringing up children on her own. She felt unable to work full time because of her childcare commitments. Even so, she really wanted to do something that would get her out of the house and stop her from feeling isolated. One day when she was visiting the doctor she noticed a poster up on the noticeboard in the surgery. It was from an organisation called Wakefield Riding for the Disabled. It needed volunteers to help out. Ms Asquith had done a fair bit of horse riding in the past. As she had the necessary experience with horses she thought, \"Why not?\". She was initially asked to commit only one hour a week and and has not looked back since. \"The one hour soon become 37 or 38 hours a week. I was quickly roped in,\" she explained. \"At first I was only paid \u00a32O a week. Any more and I would have lost my benefit. But for the last five years I've been paid full time as a manager.\" \"The job's great. I really loved it. The only trouble was I did not have any training, and certainly none in management issues.\" Ms Asquith had two staff to manage and up to eight volunteers at any one time. There was too much for her to do on a day-to-day basis. \"Working with horses means that you can never predict exactly what is going to happen. Even so, the horse side of things was fine, and the riders were enjoying the riding. But I still got the sense that we were always managing a crisis. We were working one day to the next. We never really got anywhere because I did not have time to plan ahead.\" Ms Asquith was impressed by the adviser from the Project 2001 team who came to see her. \"She was really great. It was obvious to her that if the organisation was ever going to move forward and grow, I needed to go on management training,\" she says. \"She suggested I took an NVQ in management, which a Project 2001 grant would pay for.\" Ms Asquith had to travel from Wakefield to York one afternoon a month to take the course which was run by the Advisory Council for Voluntary Organisations. She enjoyed it tremendously. \"It was so inspirational. Most of the people on the course were like me. They were women with kids. It was brilliant to know there were others dealing with the same problems and same issues. \" Now Ms Asquith has an NVQ4 in management. Both she and Wakefield Riders for the Disabled have benefited from this training. \"It is now much easier to spot problems early and deal with them before they become a big issue. It has also made me much more confident in my abilities. We have also been able to improve our communications with other local organisations. This has raised our profile locally.\" Ms Asquith stressed that her training has not just benefited her personally, but has helped the whole organisation to develop. \"I've learnt to plan and prioritise and concentrate on the key issues for the organisation. Things are now really happening. We have produced a handbook which shows how to train people who want to be riding instructors for disabled people. We have distributed this guide to 600 groups. It is now going to be used nationally.\" Ms Asquith herself has volunteered to be a mentor for other management trainees from the voluntary sector. \"I learnt a lot from other people when I was on the course. Hopefully, I can now pass on my experience to help others.\"",

      "body": "<b>Introduction</b> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.historyguy.com/suez_war_1956.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Suez crisis</a> is often portrayed as Britain's <a href=\"http://landow.stg.brown.edu/post/uk/ishiguro/rodsuez2.html\" target=\"_NEW\">last fling of the imperial dice</a>. In 1956, the globe was indeed still circled by British possessions and dependencies, from the Caribbean in the west to Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong in the east. Much of the African map was still imperial pink.</p> <p>In reality, though, the sun had long since begun to sink over the British empire. The greatest possession of them all, the Indian subcontinent, had taken its freedom. Nationalist movements were flourishing in most of the rest, patronised by Soviet Russia and encouraged by the United States in its self-appointed role as leader of the free world. Britain itself was only beginning to emerge from postwar austerity, its public finances crushed by an accumulation of war debt.</p> <p>Still, there were powerful figures in the \"establishment\" - a phrase coined in the early 1950s - who could not accept that Britain was no longer a first-rate power. Their case, in the context of the times, was persuasive: we had nuclear arms, a permanent seat on the UN security council, and military forces in both hemispheres. We remained a trading nation, with a vital interest in the global free passage of goods.</p> <p>But there was another, darker, motive for intervention in Egypt: the sense of moral and military superiority which had accreted in the centuries of imperial expansion. Though it may now seem quaint and self-serving, there was a widespread and genuine feeling that Britain had responsibilities in its diminishing empire, to protect its peoples from communism and other forms of demagoguery.</p> <p>Much more potently, there was ingrained racism. When the revolutionaries in Cairo dared to suggest that they would take charge of the Suez canal, the naked prejudice of the imperial era bubbled to the surface. The Egyptians, after all, were among the original targets of the epithet, \"westernised (or wily) oriental gentlemen. They were the Wogs.</p> <p><b>Background</b></p> <p>King <a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg/html/e_king_farouk_i.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Farouk</a>, the ruler of Egypt, was forced into exile in mid-1952. A year later, a group of army officers formally took over the government which they already controlled. The titular head of the junta was General Mohammed Neguib. The real power behind the new throne was an ambitious and visionary young colonel who dreamed of reasserting the dignity and freedom of the Arab nation, with Egypt at the heart of the renaissance. His name was <a href=\"http://english.planetarabia.com/channels/article.cfm?channelID=17&amp;articleID=24\" target=\"_NEW\">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>.</p> <p>Nasser's first target was the continued British military presence in the Suez canal zone. A source of bitter resentment among many Egyptians, that presence was a symbol of <a href=\"http://touregypt.net/hbritish.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">British imperial dominance</a> since the 1880s. In 1954, having established himself as uncontested leader of Egypt, Nasser negotiated a new treaty, under which British forces would leave within 20 months.</p> <p>At first, the largely peaceful transition of power in Egypt was little noticed in a world beset by turmoil and revolution. The cold war was at its height. Communism was entrenched throughout eastern Europe; the French were being chased out of Indo-China and were engaged in a vicious civil war in Algeria; the infant state of Israel had fought off the combined might of six Arab armies, and Britain was trying to hold down insurgents in Cyprus, Kenya and Malaya.</p> <p>British politics, too, was in a state of flux, with a new generation of leaders emerging to preside over belated postwar prosperity. But when Winston Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, at the age of 80, he was succeeded by the last of the old guard: <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PReden.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Anthony Eden</a>.</p> <p>After a lifetime at the cutting edge of British statesmanship, Eden was a curiously inadequate man. He had the vanity that often accompanies good looks, and the querulous temper that goes with innate weakness. He had been foreign secretary throughout the war and again, under the old imperialist Churchill, from 1951 to 55. For all his experience, he never absorbed the simple postwar truth: that the world had changed forever.</p> <p>In July 1956, the last British soldiers pulled out of the canal zone. On July 26, Nasser abruptly announced the <a href=\"http://campus.northpark.edu/history/WebChron/MiddleEast/SuezNat.html\" target=\"_NEW\">nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company</a>. Eden was scandalised and, riding a wave of popular indignation, prepared a grotesquely disproportionate response: full scale invasion.</p> <p><b>Military operations</b></p> <p>Nasser's nationalisation of the canal was followed by intensive diplomatic activity, ostensibly aimed at establishing some kind of international control of the strategically vital waterway. It turned out to be a smokescreen for military preparations.</p> <p>In September, Nasser made <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1956Nasser-suez1.html\" target=\"_NEW\">a defiant speech</a> rejecting the idea of international supervision of an Egyptian national asset. By then, the die was cast.</p> <p>British and French troops, spearheaded by <a href=\"http://home.ica.net/~jwilmot/army/opnov.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">airborne forces</a>, invaded the canal zone on October 31. Their governments told an outraged world that they had to invade, to separate Egyptian and Israeli forces, and thus protect the freedom of navigation on the canal. The reality was that the British and French, in top secret negotiations with Israel had forged an agreement for joint military operations. Israel, in fact, had the most <a href=\"http://www.megastories.com/mideast/wars/1956.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">legitimate grievance</a> of the three invaders, for since the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948, Egypt had denied passage through the canal to any Israeli-flagged or Israel-bound ships.</p> <p>Israeli forces swept into the Sinai desert on September 29, two days before the Anglo-French invasion, and raced towards the canal. (One column was headed by a young brigade commander who would go on to become prime minister: Ariel Sharon). In less than seven days, the entire Sinai peninsula was in Israeli hands.</p> <p>The Anglo-French invasion was a good deal more ignominious. Just eight days after the first airborne lands, the operation was halted under a ceasefire ostensibly ordered by the United Nations, but in fact dictated by the Americans. The Egyptian air force had been destroyed and its army mauled - though it put up spirited resistance both in the canal zone and in Sinai. There is little doubt that the invading allies, who had overwhelming military advantage, could have gone on to take undisputed control of the canal zone - albeit at a cruel cost.</p> <p>The greatest irony of the operation was that it was totally counterproductive. Far from bolstering Anglo-French interests, it had badly undermined the political and military prestige of both countries. And far from ensuring international freedom of seaborne passage, it had done just the opposite: under Nasser's orders, 47 ships were scuttled in the waterway. The Suez canal was totally blocked.</p> <p><b>The diplomatic crisis</b></p> <p>Though Eden scarcely seemed to appreciate it, Britain was simply no longer capable of mounting a solo imperial adventure. In the Suez operation, British soldiers fought alongside French ones. More importantly, both fading European powers were allied with the youngest but already most potent force in the Middle East: Israel.</p> <p>But it wasn't Britain's military allies which mattered in the final analysis; it was her political foes. They most obviously included the Soviet Union and its allies, who were given a glorious opportunity to attack western imperialism (and deflect world attention from their own brutality in crushing the simultaneous Hungarian uprising).</p> <p>Much more telling than Soviet condemnation was the disapproval of the Eisenhower administration in the USA. <a href=\"http://history.acusd.edu/gen/text/suez.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Washington was appalled</a> by the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of the canal zone and the Sinai. The action threatened to destabilise the strategically vital region, and strengthen Soviet links with liberation movements around the world. It raised global tensions in an age dominated by the nuclear arms race and <a href=\"http://scienceforpeace.sa.utoronto.ca/WorkingGroupsPage/NucWeaponsPage/Documents/ThreatsNucWea.html\" target=\"_NEW\">recurring superpower crises</a>. More viscerally, it was viewed with distaste as a nakedly imperial exercise in a post-imperial age.</p> <p>Eden, a master of self-delusion, thought he had received a nod and wink of approval for the invasion from John Foster Dulles, the US secretary of state. He should have checked with <a href=\"http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/P/de34/de34.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Dwight D Eisenhower</a>, who was <a href=\"http://lsumvs.sncc.lsu.edu/lsupress/catalog/Backlist/spr-sum-95/kingseed.html\" target=\"_NEW\">enraged by the action</a>. He forced through the UN resolution imposing a ceasefire, and made it clear that in this matter at any rate, Britain would have no 'special relationship' with the USA.</p> <p>The final straw for Eden came when the Treasury told the government that sterling, under sustained attack over the crisis, needed urgent US support to the tune of a billion dollars. 'Ike' had <a href=\"http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/H/1990/ch8_p9.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">a crisp reply</a>: no ceasefire, no loan. The invaders were ordered to halt, and await the arrival of a UN intervention force.</p> <p><b>The political crisis</b></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/7/0,5716,71987+1+70161,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Suez crisis</a> provoked a mighty, if predictable, wave of jingoistic fervour in the rightwing British press. There was a tide of genuine public support for \"our boys\" and a widespread mood of hostility towards Nasser. But at the same time - and arguably for the first time - there was a countervailing popular wave of revulsion against imperialist aggression. Hugh Gaitskell, not exactly the most radical of Labour party leaders, railed passionately against the war. So did Liberals and leftwing groups. Their stand was not hugely popular - the circulation of the Manchester Guardian, which fiercely opposed the war, fell markedly during the crisis - but the anti-war movement was a dramatic, even traumatic, shock for the nation.</p> <p>What fatally undermined the Conservative government, however, was the dissent in its own ranks. Less than 50 years ago, there were plenty of Tories who still believed in the virtues of empire. But there was also a new generation which recognised the damage being done to Britain's real interests in the new world, and which was outraged by Eden's blinkered approach. Two junior ministers, Edward Boyle and Anthony Nutting, resigned from the government in protest against Suez. Among those who stayed on, but who expressed deep reservations about the Suez enterprise, was RA 'Rab' Butler, the man widely seen as Eden's heir apparent.</p> <p>Eden himself was shattered by Suez, politically, physically and emotionally. On November 19, just three days before the last of the British invaders finally left the canal zone, he abruptly took himself off to Jamaica to recover, leaving behind Rab Butler in charge of the cabinet. On January 9, 1957, Eden resigned. The Conservative mandarins who controlled the leadership promptly took their revenge on Butler, seen as the leading liberal in the party, by elevating the more rightwing <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRmacmillan.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Harold Macmillan</a> to Downing Street.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>It may now seem astonishing to those who were not alive during the Suez crisis that Britain was prepared to take part in such an imperial adventure so recently. Even to those who clearly remember it - including this writer - it seems an anachronism; an atavistic throwback.</p> <p>In 1956, after all, Elvis Presley was already a star, Disneyland had been opened in California, and British theatre was in the throes of the 'kitchen sink' revolution. And yet, though it took place well within living memory, Suez was also a link with a not-so-distant past in which imperialism was a matter of pride rather than a term of abuse.

      "bodyText": "Introduction The Suez crisis is often portrayed as Britain's last fling of the imperial dice. In 1956, the globe was indeed still circled by British possessions and dependencies, from the Caribbean in the west to Singapore, Malaya and Hong Kong in the east. Much of the African map was still imperial pink. In reality, though, the sun had long since begun to sink over the British empire. The greatest possession of them all, the Indian subcontinent, had taken its freedom. Nationalist movements were flourishing in most of the rest, patronised by Soviet Russia and encouraged by the United States in its self-appointed role as leader of the free world. Britain itself was only beginning to emerge from postwar austerity, its public finances crushed by an accumulation of war debt. Still, there were powerful figures in the \"establishment\" - a phrase coined in the early 1950s - who could not accept that Britain was no longer a first-rate power. Their case, in the context of the times, was persuasive: we had nuclear arms, a permanent seat on the UN security council, and military forces in both hemispheres. We remained a trading nation, with a vital interest in the global free passage of goods. But there was another, darker, motive for intervention in Egypt: the sense of moral and military superiority which had accreted in the centuries of imperial expansion. Though it may now seem quaint and self-serving, there was a widespread and genuine feeling that Britain had responsibilities in its diminishing empire, to protect its peoples from communism and other forms of demagoguery. Much more potently, there was ingrained racism. When the revolutionaries in Cairo dared to suggest that they would take charge of the Suez canal, the naked prejudice of the imperial era bubbled to the surface. The Egyptians, after all, were among the original targets of the epithet, \"westernised (or wily) oriental gentlemen. They were the Wogs. Background King Farouk, the ruler of Egypt, was forced into exile in mid-1952. A year later, a group of army officers formally took over the government which they already controlled. The titular head of the junta was General Mohammed Neguib. The real power behind the new throne was an ambitious and visionary young colonel who dreamed of reasserting the dignity and freedom of the Arab nation, with Egypt at the heart of the renaissance. His name was Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser's first target was the continued British military presence in the Suez canal zone. A source of bitter resentment among many Egyptians, that presence was a symbol of British imperial dominance since the 1880s. In 1954, having established himself as uncontested leader of Egypt, Nasser negotiated a new treaty, under which British forces would leave within 20 months. At first, the largely peaceful transition of power in Egypt was little noticed in a world beset by turmoil and revolution. The cold war was at its height. Communism was entrenched throughout eastern Europe; the French were being chased out of Indo-China and were engaged in a vicious civil war in Algeria; the infant state of Israel had fought off the combined might of six Arab armies, and Britain was trying to hold down insurgents in Cyprus, Kenya and Malaya. British politics, too, was in a state of flux, with a new generation of leaders emerging to preside over belated postwar prosperity. But when Winston Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, at the age of 80, he was succeeded by the last of the old guard: Anthony Eden. After a lifetime at the cutting edge of British statesmanship, Eden was a curiously inadequate man. He had the vanity that often accompanies good looks, and the querulous temper that goes with innate weakness. He had been foreign secretary throughout the war and again, under the old imperialist Churchill, from 1951 to 55. For all his experience, he never absorbed the simple postwar truth: that the world had changed forever. In July 1956, the last British soldiers pulled out of the canal zone. On July 26, Nasser abruptly announced the nationalisation of the Suez Canal Company. Eden was scandalised and, riding a wave of popular indignation, prepared a grotesquely disproportionate response: full scale invasion. Military operations Nasser's nationalisation of the canal was followed by intensive diplomatic activity, ostensibly aimed at establishing some kind of international control of the strategically vital waterway. It turned out to be a smokescreen for military preparations. In September, Nasser made a defiant speech rejecting the idea of international supervision of an Egyptian national asset. By then, the die was cast. British and French troops, spearheaded by airborne forces, invaded the canal zone on October 31. Their governments told an outraged world that they had to invade, to separate Egyptian and Israeli forces, and thus protect the freedom of navigation on the canal. The reality was that the British and French, in top secret negotiations with Israel had forged an agreement for joint military operations. Israel, in fact, had the most legitimate grievance of the three invaders, for since the establishment of the Jewish state in 1948, Egypt had denied passage through the canal to any Israeli-flagged or Israel-bound ships. Israeli forces swept into the Sinai desert on September 29, two days before the Anglo-French invasion, and raced towards the canal. (One column was headed by a young brigade commander who would go on to become prime minister: Ariel Sharon). In less than seven days, the entire Sinai peninsula was in Israeli hands. The Anglo-French invasion was a good deal more ignominious. Just eight days after the first airborne lands, the operation was halted under a ceasefire ostensibly ordered by the United Nations, but in fact dictated by the Americans. The Egyptian air force had been destroyed and its army mauled - though it put up spirited resistance both in the canal zone and in Sinai. There is little doubt that the invading allies, who had overwhelming military advantage, could have gone on to take undisputed control of the canal zone - albeit at a cruel cost. The greatest irony of the operation was that it was totally counterproductive. Far from bolstering Anglo-French interests, it had badly undermined the political and military prestige of both countries. And far from ensuring international freedom of seaborne passage, it had done just the opposite: under Nasser's orders, 47 ships were scuttled in the waterway. The Suez canal was totally blocked. The diplomatic crisis Though Eden scarcely seemed to appreciate it, Britain was simply no longer capable of mounting a solo imperial adventure. In the Suez operation, British soldiers fought alongside French ones. More importantly, both fading European powers were allied with the youngest but already most potent force in the Middle East: Israel. But it wasn't Britain's military allies which mattered in the final analysis; it was her political foes. They most obviously included the Soviet Union and its allies, who were given a glorious opportunity to attack western imperialism (and deflect world attention from their own brutality in crushing the simultaneous Hungarian uprising). Much more telling than Soviet condemnation was the disapproval of the Eisenhower administration in the USA. Washington was appalled by the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of the canal zone and the Sinai. The action threatened to destabilise the strategically vital region, and strengthen Soviet links with liberation movements around the world. It raised global tensions in an age dominated by the nuclear arms race and recurring superpower crises. More viscerally, it was viewed with distaste as a nakedly imperial exercise in a post-imperial age. Eden, a master of self-delusion, thought he had received a nod and wink of approval for the invasion from John Foster Dulles, the US secretary of state. He should have checked with Dwight D Eisenhower, who was enraged by the action. He forced through the UN resolution imposing a ceasefire, and made it clear that in this matter at any rate, Britain would have no 'special relationship' with the USA. The final straw for Eden came when the Treasury told the government that sterling, under sustained attack over the crisis, needed urgent US support to the tune of a billion dollars. 'Ike' had a crisp reply: no ceasefire, no loan. The invaders were ordered to halt, and await the arrival of a UN intervention force. The political crisis The Suez crisis provoked a mighty, if predictable, wave of jingoistic fervour in the rightwing British press. There was a tide of genuine public support for \"our boys\" and a widespread mood of hostility towards Nasser. But at the same time - and arguably for the first time - there was a countervailing popular wave of revulsion against imperialist aggression. Hugh Gaitskell, not exactly the most radical of Labour party leaders, railed passionately against the war. So did Liberals and leftwing groups. Their stand was not hugely popular - the circulation of the Manchester Guardian, which fiercely opposed the war, fell markedly during the crisis - but the anti-war movement was a dramatic, even traumatic, shock for the nation. What fatally undermined the Conservative government, however, was the dissent in its own ranks. Less than 50 years ago, there were plenty of Tories who still believed in the virtues of empire. But there was also a new generation which recognised the damage being done to Britain's real interests in the new world, and which was outraged by Eden's blinkered approach. Two junior ministers, Edward Boyle and Anthony Nutting, resigned from the government in protest against Suez. Among those who stayed on, but who expressed deep reservations about the Suez enterprise, was RA 'Rab' Butler, the man widely seen as Eden's heir apparent. Eden himself was shattered by Suez, politically, physically and emotionally. On November 19, just three days before the last of the British invaders finally left the canal zone, he abruptly took himself off to Jamaica to recover, leaving behind Rab Butler in charge of the cabinet. On January 9, 1957, Eden resigned. The Conservative mandarins who controlled the leadership promptly took their revenge on Butler, seen as the leading liberal in the party, by elevating the more rightwing Harold Macmillan to Downing Street. Conclusion It may now seem astonishing to those who were not alive during the Suez crisis that Britain was prepared to take part in such an imperial adventure so recently. Even to those who clearly remember it - including this writer - it seems an anachronism; an atavistic throwback. In 1956, after all, Elvis Presley was already a star, Disneyland had been opened in California, and British theatre was in the throes of the 'kitchen sink' revolution. And yet, though it took place well within living memory, Suez was also a link with a not-so-distant past in which imperialism was a matter of pride rather than a term of abuse. Indeed, it marked definitively the transition between those two things. British soldiers would go on fighting in various corners of the shrinking empire - east Africa, Aden, Malaya, Borneo and the Falklands - for another 25 years or so. The difference, after Suez, is that they fought largely to defend local regimes and systems, rather than to impose the will of London. The years immediately following Suez saw a slew of new countries on the world stage which had formerly been colonies and dependencies. There is little doubt that the end of the imperial era was greatly accelerated by the squalid little war in Egypt.

      "body": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>The outcome of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/background/pastelec/ge45.shtml\">the 1945 election</a> was more than a sensation. It was a political earthquake.</p> <p>Less than 12 weeks earlier, <a href=\"http://www.winstonchurchill.org\">Winston Churchill</a> had announced the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. Churchill wanted his wartime coalition to continue until Japan too had been defeated, but was not unduly dismayed when his Labour ministers insisted that the country be offered a choice. The prime minister called the election for early July, confident that the British people would back the greatest hero of the hour. Of all Churchill's colossal misjudgments, that was probably the most egregious.</p> <p>The voters wanted an end to wartime austerity, and no return to prewar economic depression. They wanted change. Three years earlier, in the darkest days of the war, they had been offered a tantalising glimpse of how things could be in the bright dawn of victory. The economist <a href=\"http://www.nhs50.nhs.uk/nhsstory-beveridge.htm\">William Beveridge</a> had synthesised the bravest visions of all important government departments into a single breathtaking view of the future.</p> <p>The 1942 <a href=\"http://www.adam-matthew-publications.co.uk/guides/g014.htm\">Beveridge Report</a> spelled out a system of social insurance, covering every citizen regardless of income. It offered nothing less than a cradle-to-grave welfare state.</p> <p>That was the great promise dangled before the British electorate in 1945. Though Churchill had presided over the planning for radical social reform, though he was a genuine hero of the masses - and though, ironically enough, the Tory manifesto pledges were not all that different from Labour's - the people did not trust him to deliver the brave new world of Beveridge.</p> <p>There were other factors too. The Labour party had held office only twice before, in 1924 and in 1929-31, but during the war years its leadership had acquired both experience and trust. It now looked like a party of government.</p> <p>Labour's promise to take over the commanding heights of the economy via nationalisation were anathema to committed Tories, but after nearly six years of wartime state direction of the economy it did not seem nearly so radical as it had before the war - or indeed as it seems now.</p> <p>Then there was the military vote. Britain had millions of men and women in uniform in 1945, scattered over Europe, the far east, and elsewhere. They, more than any other section of the electorate, yearned for change and for a better civilian life. The military vote was overwhelmingly pro-Labour.</p> <p>Many students of the 1945 election believe that a key role was played by the <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Jmirror.htm\">Daily Mirror</a>, then the biggest selling paper in Britain, and easily the most popular among the armed forces. On VE (Victory in Europe) Day, the Mirror published an immensely powerful cartoon by the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Jzec.htm\">Philip Zec</a>. It showed a battered, bandaged Allied soldier holding out to the reader a slip of paper marked Victory and Peace in Europe. Under the drawing was the caption \"Here you are! Don't lose it again.\"</p> <p>The same cartoon was published on the Mirror's front page on the morning of the most remarkable general election of the 20th century. But when the result was announced on July 26 - three weeks after polling day to allow military postal votes to be counted - it was clear that <a href=\"http://www.ukpol.co.uk/gen.shtml\">postwar politics</a> had changed utterly.</p> <p>With 47.7% of the vote, Labour secured a staggering 393 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservatives, with 39.7%, won just 210 seats. The Liberal party, which had governed the country less than quarter of a century earlier, was reduced to 9% of the vote, and just 12 seats. The new prime minister was Churchill's deputy in the war time coalition, <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/TUattlee.htm\">Clement Attlee</a>.</p> <p>On the first day of the new parliament, the massed ranks of Labour members bawled out the socialist anthem, the Red Flag. Tories everywhere were scandalised. (There is a splendid apocryphal story of a lady in a grand London hotel who was overheard exclaiming \"Labour in power?

It was achieved only after two years of bitter resistance by the medical establishment, with consultants threatening strike action and the British Medical Association pouring out gloomy warnings about bureaucracy and expense.</p> <p>Alas, those warnings proved to have more than a grain of truth, and the government was forced to retreat from its first grand vision of free, comprehensive health care for all. In the beginning, everything was provided: hospital accommodation, GP cover, medicine, dental care, and even spectacles. But with Britain showing few signs of economic take off, the budgetary burden was enormous. In 1951, chancellor of the exchequer Hugh Gaitskell was obliged to reintroduce charges for NHS false teeth and glasses. Aneurin Bevan, Harold Wilson and junior minister John Freeman stormed out of government, and Attlee's goose was cooked.</p> <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p> <p>Attlee's government took office in a world changing at bewildering speed. The war had forged new alliances, the greatest and most nebulous of all the United Nations. The USA and the USSR were undisputed superpowers; Britain and France deluded themselves that they were too.</p> <p>In the far east, the embers of nationalism had been stirred into flame by the brutal advance and subsequent stubborn retreat of Japan. Britain's ignominious surrender of Singapore in 1941 had sent a clear signal to Asia that the daysof European imperialism were numbered.</p> <p>With hindsight it was a blessing for Britain, as well as for its vast numbers of subjects around the world, that Winston Churchill lost the 1945 election. The old warrior was, at heart, a Victorian romantic, hopelessly in thrall to the so called romance of empire. His antipathy to <a href=\"http://india.indiagov.org/culture/history/history8.htm\">India's independence struggle</a>, in particular, was well established.</p> <p>Attlee, on the other hand, recognised that the British Raj was doomed. He had been to Haileybury College, after all, and had paid an official visit to India in 1929. Even if the prime minister had harboured any illusions about Britain's duty to its 300m Indian subjects, he was constantly reminded by Washington that the US would not tolerate the continuance of empire. Wisely, he bowed to the inevitable, and prepared for withdrawal.</p> <p>But even as it bade farewell, Britain was to visit two disasters on the subcontinent. One was Attlee's appointment of Lord Mountbatten as the last Viceroy. Conceited, impatient, and breathtakingly arrogant, he took to the grandeur and the raw power of the job with unholy relish.</p> <p>Mountbatten decided that independence would come on August 1947, on the second anniversary of the day he had accepted the surrender of the Japanese in south-east Asia. Nothing was to stand in the way of this vainglory - not even the unresolved issue of Muslim demands for a separate state, and the gathering storm clouds of communal violence.</p> <p>In a few summer weeks, colonial servants scribbled lines across the map of the mighty subcontinent, carving East and West Pakistan out of Mother India, and sparking a bloodbath so frightful that no one to this day knows exactly how many millions died. The holocaust even consumed <a href=\"http://www2.lucidcafe.com/lucidcafe/library/95oct/mkgandhi.html\">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, the father of free India and of freedom movements everywhere, who was <a href=\"http://library.advanced.org/26523/main.htm\">assassinated</a> months after independence. Thus ended 300 years of history, and 90 years of Raj. King George VI would be the last British monarch to style himself emperor of India.</p> <p>There was another colonial retreat, in a way just as disgraceful, on the extreme west of Asia. For just over a quarter of a century British administrators had tried, and on the whole failed, to make sense of their League of Nations (later United Nations) mandate to rule Palestine. They tried partition, appeasement, manipulation and bald coercion. Nothing helped assuage the bloody friction between the rising tide of Jewish immigrants and the native Palestinians.</p> <p>The end of the second world war brought new waves of refugees from Nazi tyranny to the shores of the holy land, and the conflict became more unholy than ever. Washington was adamant that nothing should stand in the way of the establishment of Israel and when the mandate finally dribbled into the sands of history in May 1948, the new state was born, <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/ISRAEL/Record/48war.html\">fighting for its life</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, of course, Britain's imperial might remained intact. The Union flag still flew over huge tracts of Africa, whole archipelagos in the Caribbean and Pacific, jewels of Asia like Singapore and Hong Kong. But there was another much greater reality: British adherence to, and even dependence on, the patronage of the United States. We tagged along with Washington in the occupation of Germany and the establishment of Nato; we acquiesced in the new division of Europe between east and west; we willingly did our bit in the great airlift which saved west Berlin from the Soviet blockade of the late 1940s, and we sent our troops to <a href=\"http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/books/pd-c-01.htm\">South Korea</a> to fight for the United Nations - under US direction - against China and the North.</p> <p>At the insistence of Attlee and the Labour right, we developed our very own nuclear weapons and insisted that they kept us independent. In reality, the north Atlantic connection was the only one which ultimately mattered.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>It is tempting to think of the Attlee years as an anti-climax. After the clamour of victory, the peace was a drab disappointment. And after all the fervent promises of a new dawn, British life remained to a large extent grey and grim. At times, food restrictions were even tighter than during the war - bread was rationed for the first time. Class enmities flourished; social and economic inequalities remained palpable. Here and there were little pockets of a new prosperity: television broadcasts were resumed, the first <a href=\"http://www.morrisminoroc.co.uk\">Morris Minors</a> appeared, and British designers were working on the world's first commercial jet, the <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Lab/8803/comet.htm\">De Havilland Comet</a>. But of that great universal prosperity which seemed to glow from the 1945 manifestos, there was little sign.</p> <p>And yet, and yet... Britain in the Attlee years changed more than under any other government, before or since. The welfare reforms, and to a lesser extent the great experiment of state control of industry, had a profound effect on the way the people saw themselves and their country. And what they saw, on the whole, was pleasing.</p> <p>In 1950, after five exhausting years, it was inevitable that the great electoral tide of 1945 would be turned. But in the general election of that year the Labour vote dipped less than 2%, and it was only the vagaries of the first past the post system that saw the Tories gain 88 seats.</p> <p>Still, Attlee remained in power, at the head of an increasingly fractious government rent by ideological divisions, and fatally wounded by the illness and withdrawal from public life of men like Cripps and Bevin. When the NHS prescription charge issue finally ripped the party apart, the prime minister was obliged to go to the country again in 1951.</p> <p>Even then, Labour retained the faith of the people, gaining its highest ever share of the vote: 48.8%. Indeed, it was the closest any party came in the 20th century to achieving a popular majority mandate, but it was still not enough. The key turned out to be the Liberal vote, which suddenly evaporated, leaving the party with just 2.5% support and six MPs. The Conservatives ended up with fewer votes than Labour, but 26 more MPs.

      "bodyText": "Introduction The outcome of the 1945 election was more than a sensation. It was a political earthquake. Less than 12 weeks earlier, Winston Churchill had announced the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. Churchill wanted his wartime coalition to continue until Japan too had been defeated, but was not unduly dismayed when his Labour ministers insisted that the country be offered a choice. The prime minister called the election for early July, confident that the British people would back the greatest hero of the hour. Of all Churchill's colossal misjudgments, that was probably the most egregious. The voters wanted an end to wartime austerity, and no return to prewar economic depression. They wanted change. Three years earlier, in the darkest days of the war, they had been offered a tantalising glimpse of how things could be in the bright dawn of victory. The economist William Beveridge had synthesised the bravest visions of all important government departments into a single breathtaking view of the future. The 1942 Beveridge Report spelled out a system of social insurance, covering every citizen regardless of income. It offered nothing less than a cradle-to-grave welfare state. That was the great promise dangled before the British electorate in 1945. Though Churchill had presided over the planning for radical social reform, though he was a genuine hero of the masses - and though, ironically enough, the Tory manifesto pledges were not all that different from Labour's - the people did not trust him to deliver the brave new world of Beveridge. There were other factors too. The Labour party had held office only twice before, in 1924 and in 1929-31, but during the war years its leadership had acquired both experience and trust. It now looked like a party of government. Labour's promise to take over the commanding heights of the economy via nationalisation were anathema to committed Tories, but after nearly six years of wartime state direction of the economy it did not seem nearly so radical as it had before the war - or indeed as it seems now. Then there was the military vote. Britain had millions of men and women in uniform in 1945, scattered over Europe, the far east, and elsewhere. They, more than any other section of the electorate, yearned for change and for a better civilian life. The military vote was overwhelmingly pro-Labour. Many students of the 1945 election believe that a key role was played by the Daily Mirror, then the biggest selling paper in Britain, and easily the most popular among the armed forces. On VE (Victory in Europe) Day, the Mirror published an immensely powerful cartoon by the brilliant Philip Zec. It showed a battered, bandaged Allied soldier holding out to the reader a slip of paper marked Victory and Peace in Europe. Under the drawing was the caption \"Here you are! Don't lose it again.\" The same cartoon was published on the Mirror's front page on the morning of the most remarkable general election of the 20th century. But when the result was announced on July 26 - three weeks after polling day to allow military postal votes to be counted - it was clear that postwar politics had changed utterly. With 47.7% of the vote, Labour secured a staggering 393 seats in the House of Commons. The Conservatives, with 39.7%, won just 210 seats. The Liberal party, which had governed the country less than quarter of a century earlier, was reduced to 9% of the vote, and just 12 seats. The new prime minister was Churchill's deputy in the war time coalition, Clement Attlee. On the first day of the new parliament, the massed ranks of Labour members bawled out the socialist anthem, the Red Flag. Tories everywhere were scandalised. (There is a splendid apocryphal story of a lady in a grand London hotel who was overheard exclaiming \"Labour in power? The country will never stand for it!\") But stand for it they did, over the next six momentous years. Clement Attlee The new prime minister was not obviously cut out for the job. Painfully shy and reserved to the point of coldness, he had the appearance - and often the style - of a bank clerk. Churchill described him, cruelly, as \"a sheep in sheep's clothing\". The son of a City solicitor, he was educated at Haileybury College - which specialised in turning out administrators for the British Raj - and at University College, Oxford. Attlee was so far from being a passionate ideologue that his wife Violet once casually observed: \"Clem was never really a socialist, were you, darling? Well, not a rabid one.\" Yet this essentially herbivorous exterior cloaked a steely determination, and a deepseated devotion to social justice first developed during his voluntary work in London's East End before the first world war. After distinguished service in that war, Attlee entered parliament in 1922, and served in the first two Labour governments. In 1931, he declined to join Ramsey Macdonald's national coalition, preferring to stay with the rump opposition. He became Labour leader in 1935. Though many on the left opposed Labour participation in Churchill's wartime coalition (at least during the early years when Hitler was allied with the Soviet Union under Stalin), Attlee responded to the national crisis by guiding his party into the national government. He became Lord Privy Seal and, from 1942, deputy prime minister. He was 62 when he entered Downing Street. Attlee's team The great tide of new Labour MPs who entered the Commons in 1945 included some eager youngsters who were to make their mark on the party, and indeed the country. They included Denis Healey (who made an impassioned maiden speech urging world socialist revolution), Harold Wilson, Michael Foot, and James Callaghan. But the men Attlee leaned on were of course of Labour's old guard. His principal props were Ernest Bevin, a pragmatic trade unionist who had made his mark during the war as an energetic labour minister, Labour stalwart Hugh Dalton, and Stafford Cripps, an aloof intellectual (Churchilll once remarked of him: \"There but for the grace of God, goes God.\"). The Attlee-Bevin alliance was particularly important in protecting the administration from some of its own hotter blooded members, who shared the young Healey's enthusiasm for revolution. Their most potent figurehead was Aneurin Bevan, a fiery orator from the Welsh valleys, who constantly urged the government to embrace radical reforms, and bitterly resisted any suggestion of pragmatic trimming of policy. Bevan eventually was to deal the Attlee administration a hammer blow, when he resigned over the reintroduction of NHS prescription charges. For six years, though, his was the voice of radical Labour. Nationalisation \"The Labour Party is a Socialist Party, and proud of it.\" The stark sentence is buried in the party's 1945 election manifesto, which promised that Labour would take control of the economy and in particular of the manufacturing industry. The manifesto pledged nationalisation of the Bank of England, the fuel and power industries, inland transport, and iron and steel. And with a majority of more than 150, the party could not be denied. One by one the key industries of the postwar economy tumbled into the public sector, where they were subject to elaborate planning controls. For the most part the takeovers were highly popular; none more so than the nationalisation of the coalmines. Pit owners still employed a million men, many of them in dire and dangerous conditions. The new national coal board was seen as much as a humanitarian institution as an economic one. Other nationalisation operations were regarded more cynically. No sooner had British Railways taken over the old regional semi-private networks than jokes began to circulate about unreliable, crowded trains, crumbling stations and that old standby of British comedy, the buffet sandwich. After the initial euphoria of nationalisation, it wasn't long before doubts began to emerge. The state industries were smothered by bureaucracy and the demands of Labour's economic gurus, both amateur and professional. Their bolder ideas were often subsumed in the delicate balance between principle and pragmatism. It became clear that the lumbering machinery of economic planning could not deliver what the voters had demanded and Labour had promised: full employment, secure jobs with fair wages, an end to wartime rationing and - above all perhaps - decent homes for all. It has sometimes been argued that the Attlee government's main disadvantage was that Britain had been on the winning side in the war. British cities and industries had been bashed around by German air raids, but had not suffered the wholesale destruction which allowed the renascent German economy to start from a clean sheet.

It had pawned many of its most valuable assets, including a huge slice of overseas investments, to service that debt. And even when the war was finally over, the victorious, impoverished British maintained vast numbers of men and resources tied up in an empire on which the sun was about to set. In Europe, Britain paid for a huge army of occupation in Germany. The dawn of the nuclear age, and British pride, demanded handsome investment in the new terrible weapons which would keep us allegedly a first class power. The disarmament, which some in the Labour party craved, proved illusory as - in Churchill's words again - an iron curtain descended across Europe, and the cold war began. Speaking of cold, even the weather seemed at times to conspire against Labour. The winter of 1946-47 was one of the most severe ever recorded, causing widespread misery and disruption. One of the few truly cheering aspects of life was the imminent arrival of the Beveridge reforms. The welfare state The Attlee government is rightly seen as one of the great reformist administrations of the 20th century. It is a pleasant irony that the impetus for the more durable reforms came from outside the party. The 1944 Education Act, which had introduced the concept of selection at 11 and compulsory free secondary education for all, was based on the work of a Tory, Richard Austin 'Rab' Butler, who went on to conquer all but the tallest peak of British politics. The introduction of the welfare state rested very largely on the work of two Liberal economists: John Maynard Keynes, who argued the virtues of full employment and state stimulation of the economy, and William Beveridge. Beveridge's ideas were culled from every nook and cranny of Whitehall. His formidable task was to put together a coherent plan for postwar social reconstruction. What he came up with extended hugely the framework of national insurance first put in place before the first world war by David Lloyd George. Every British citizen would be covered, regardless of income or lack of it. Those who lacked jobs and homes would be helped. Those who were sick, would be cured. The birth of the National Health Service in July 1948 remains Labour's greatest monument. It was achieved only after two years of bitter resistance by the medical establishment, with consultants threatening strike action and the British Medical Association pouring out gloomy warnings about bureaucracy and expense. Alas, those warnings proved to have more than a grain of truth, and the government was forced to retreat from its first grand vision of free, comprehensive health care for all. In the beginning, everything was provided: hospital accommodation, GP cover, medicine, dental care, and even spectacles. But with Britain showing few signs of economic take off, the budgetary burden was enormous. In 1951, chancellor of the exchequer Hugh Gaitskell was obliged to reintroduce charges for NHS false teeth and glasses. Aneurin Bevan, Harold Wilson and junior minister John Freeman stormed out of government, and Attlee's goose was cooked. Foreign policy Attlee's government took office in a world changing at bewildering speed. The war had forged new alliances, the greatest and most nebulous of all the United Nations. The USA and the USSR were undisputed superpowers; Britain and France deluded themselves that they were too. In the far east, the embers of nationalism had been stirred into flame by the brutal advance and subsequent stubborn retreat of Japan. Britain's ignominious surrender of Singapore in 1941 had sent a clear signal to Asia that the daysof European imperialism were numbered. With hindsight it was a blessing for Britain, as well as for its vast numbers of subjects around the world, that Winston Churchill lost the 1945 election. The old warrior was, at heart, a Victorian romantic, hopelessly in thrall to the so called romance of empire. His antipathy to India's independence struggle, in particular, was well established. Attlee, on the other hand, recognised that the British Raj was doomed. He had been to Haileybury College, after all, and had paid an official visit to India in 1929. Even if the prime minister had harboured any illusions about Britain's duty to its 300m Indian subjects, he was constantly reminded by Washington that the US would not tolerate the continuance of empire. Wisely, he bowed to the inevitable, and prepared for withdrawal. But even as it bade farewell, Britain was to visit two disasters on the subcontinent. One was Attlee's appointment of Lord Mountbatten as the last Viceroy. Conceited, impatient, and breathtakingly arrogant, he took to the grandeur and the raw power of the job with unholy relish. Mountbatten decided that independence would come on August 1947, on the second anniversary of the day he had accepted the surrender of the Japanese in south-east Asia. Nothing was to stand in the way of this vainglory - not even the unresolved issue of Muslim demands for a separate state, and the gathering storm clouds of communal violence. In a few summer weeks, colonial servants scribbled lines across the map of the mighty subcontinent, carving East and West Pakistan out of Mother India, and sparking a bloodbath so frightful that no one to this day knows exactly how many millions died. The holocaust even consumed Mahatma Gandhi, the father of free India and of freedom movements everywhere, who was assassinated months after independence. Thus ended 300 years of history, and 90 years of Raj. King George VI would be the last British monarch to style himself emperor of India. There was another colonial retreat, in a way just as disgraceful, on the extreme west of Asia. For just over a quarter of a century British administrators had tried, and on the whole failed, to make sense of their League of Nations (later United Nations) mandate to rule Palestine. They tried partition, appeasement, manipulation and bald coercion. Nothing helped assuage the bloody friction between the rising tide of Jewish immigrants and the native Palestinians. The end of the second world war brought new waves of refugees from Nazi tyranny to the shores of the holy land, and the conflict became more unholy than ever. Washington was adamant that nothing should stand in the way of the establishment of Israel and when the mandate finally dribbled into the sands of history in May 1948, the new state was born, fighting for its life. Elsewhere, of course, Britain's imperial might remained intact. The Union flag still flew over huge tracts of Africa, whole archipelagos in the Caribbean and Pacific, jewels of Asia like Singapore and Hong Kong. But there was another much greater reality: British adherence to, and even dependence on, the patronage of the United States. We tagged along with Washington in the occupation of Germany and the establishment of Nato; we acquiesced in the new division of Europe between east and west; we willingly did our bit in the great airlift which saved west Berlin from the Soviet blockade of the late 1940s, and we sent our troops to South Korea to fight for the United Nations - under US direction - against China and the North. At the insistence of Attlee and the Labour right, we developed our very own nuclear weapons and insisted that they kept us independent. In reality, the north Atlantic connection was the only one which ultimately mattered. Conclusion It is tempting to think of the Attlee years as an anti-climax. After the clamour of victory, the peace was a drab disappointment. And after all the fervent promises of a new dawn, British life remained to a large extent grey and grim. At times, food restrictions were even tighter than during the war - bread was rationed for the first time. Class enmities flourished; social and economic inequalities remained palpable. Here and there were little pockets of a new prosperity: television broadcasts were resumed, the first Morris Minors appeared, and British designers were working on the world's first commercial jet, the De Havilland Comet. But of that great universal prosperity which seemed to glow from the 1945 manifestos, there was little sign. And yet, and yet... Britain in the Attlee years changed more than under any other government, before or since. The welfare reforms, and to a lesser extent the great experiment of state control of industry, had a profound effect on the way the people saw themselves and their country. And what they saw, on the whole, was pleasing. In 1950, after five exhausting years, it was inevitable that the great electoral tide of 1945 would be turned. But in the general election of that year the Labour vote dipped less than 2%, and it was only the vagaries of the first past the post system that saw the Tories gain 88 seats. Still, Attlee remained in power, at the head of an increasingly fractious government rent by ideological divisions, and fatally wounded by the illness and withdrawal from public life of men like Cripps and Bevin. When the NHS prescription charge issue finally ripped the party apart, the prime minister was obliged to go to the country again in 1951. Even then, Labour retained the faith of the people, gaining its highest ever share of the vote: 48.8%. Indeed, it was the closest any party came in the 20th century to achieving a popular majority mandate, but it was still not enough. The key turned out to be the Liberal vote, which suddenly evaporated, leaving the party with just 2.5% support and six MPs. The Conservatives ended up with fewer votes than Labour, but 26 more MPs. Winston Churchill was back in Downing Street.

      "bodyText": "ITV controller of drama Nick Elliott reckons the BBC should have the \"courage of their convictions\" and schedule proven BBC1 drama hits on Sunday nights. Mr Elliott was speaking as it emerged today that Clocking Off is to be moved to a midweek slot. This follows the ratings failure of recent BBC1 9pm Sunday night dramas Take a Girl Like You, Rebel Heart, Love in a Cold Climate and Best of Both Worlds. BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey has also axed the low rating Ballykissangel, even though the current series is not yet half-way through its Sunday night run. \"What they ought to do is have the courage of their convictions and go ahead with good Sunday night stuff like Clocking Off,\" said Mr Elliott. \"The pieces they've had at 9pm on Sunday night recently have been very skewed away from the mainstream audience. \"Love in a Cold Climate was so upper class and Take a Girl Like You was not very mainstream. But they seem to have panicked.\" Mr Elliott added that another option for Sunday night was to schedule the fourth episode of EastEnders on that evening. \"That would give them a better chance on Sundays.\" But he said BBC director general Greg Dyke's strategy seemed to be focused on \"building weekdays\" following the move of the BBC1 late evening bulletin to 10pm. ITV insiders believe the most likely time for the fourth edition of EastEnders is 8pm on Wednesday night, which is currently BBC1's weakest in ratings terms along with Sunday. Some at ITV reckon the fourth weekly episode of the flagship BBC1 soap could be introduced as soon as the first week after Easter in mid-April. BBC1's Sunday night woes can be laid at the door of the formidable ITV duo of Coronation Street and Heartbeat, which go out between 7.30pm and 9pm and regularly pull in audiences of 12-13m and above. Not only do BBC1 shows such as Ballykissangel struggle against these two shows, but the viewing inheritance they hand over to other ITV shows at 9pm means it is very difficult for later BBC1 programmes to build a big audience. \"ITV's got Coronation Street, a huge rock that pulls audience in early evening,\" said Carlton controller of drama Jonathan Powell. \"Then ITV builds on it with very good Sunday night family drama. There's nothing wrong with the stuff BBC1 puts out at 9pm, but it's very difficult for them to break in.\" Mr Elliott also identified another problem with attempts to improve the ratings for BBC1 drama. \"We're both more and more going for the same female-skewed, mid-market audience at 9pm.

Even the ILO definition of unemployment does not give a true guide to the state of the labour market because it focuses on those people who are \"work-ready\". It therefore excludes vast swathes of the population who do not have jobs, including those with family responsibilities who nevertheless want to work, others who have given up hope of finding work and still more who are sick and disabled. If all these people are thrown into the calculation, labour market experts reckon that the true level of joblessness is nearer to 3m, not 1m. For all these caveats, Labour still has a good story to tell the electorate. Whatever the real level of unemployment, it is heading in the right direction. In some of the more prosperous parts of the country, such as the south-east and East Anglia, the goal of full employment has already been achieved. The challenge Labour has rightly set itself for a second term is to make sure full employment becomes a reality for all regions.

      "bodyText": "ITV is hoping for a multimillion-pound cash windfall from its \u00a3100m satellite broadcasting deal. ITV giants Granada and Carlton Communications will receive a rebate on their licence fee according to how many of their viewers use the digital service, which will be launched by the end of the year. Under the terms of the latest regional licence agreements, ITV companies could therefore make a considerable saving on the \u00a3450m a year they pay out to the government in franchise fees. A major drain on ITV revenues is the \"percentage of qualifying revenue\" or PQR. This accounts for three-quarters of the \u00a3450m bill and is based on a percentage of the network's advertising income. If millions of ITV viewers switch to watching the channel on digital satellite as a result of today's deal, the rebate on PQR totals could be significant. \"It is the first piece of good news for ITV earnings we have heard in the past few months,\" said Simon Baker, analyst at SG Securities. One senior media analyst added ITV should not worry about paying a reported \u00a320m a year to appear on Sky Digital. \"It will take them six months to make that money back if they join up with Sky,\" he said. However, some analysts pointed out the cost of beaming ITV onto a satellite platform will not be cheap. \"There will be savings on PQR but there will also be substantial costs in running a satellite service. \"The financial advantage could be wiped out by the cost of distributing the channels,\" said Mathew Horsman, analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.

There are several theories as to where we picked it up from, but nobody is really all that bothered. Whatever its origins, we're all fond of it - and no bona fide supporter refers to the club as 'Plymouth', we're Argyle, simple as that. </p> <p>Then there's the dubious distinction of being the only League club in the country to have chosen green as its colour, and stuck with it. </p> <p>And then of course - and this is the one we hate most - we are the second biggest city in England never to have graced the top-flight with a football team. At least Hull can claim to being the biggest city never to have achieved premier status. We can't even come top of that particular table of shame!</p> <p><strong>The highs . . .</strong></p> <p>Errrrmmmm . . . not a lot to write home about, to be honest. Whilst more glamorous sides will accept nothing less than a place in Europe, or another trophy in the cabinet come the season's end, little old Argyle have traditionally settled for much less. Scraping the bottom of the Home Park achievement barrel, you'd struggle to come up with anything other than our one and only Wembley appearance, back in 1996. Our first-ever season in the League's basement division ended with a successful run in the play-offs, and 32,000 Greens made the trip to the decaying national stadium to see Ronnie Mauge leap like a salmon above the Darlington defence to send us back into the promised land. Well, the Second Division anyway.</p> <p>The 1993/94 season was one of near constant highs. Peter Shilton - before he started borrowing money off of everyone from his assistant manager to the Home Park tea-lady - built a side that is widely recognised as one of the best ever to grace Home Park. Steve Castle, Paul Dalton, Dwight Marshall et al swept the Second Division aside in their charge towards the play-offs. Their 88 League goals bettered the tally of every other team in Britain, and their 8-1 victory at Hartlepool on the final day summed up one of the most memorable campaigns in the history of our football club.</p> <p>And then Burnley came along. </p> <p><strong>. . . and the lows</strong></p> <p>So, Burnley. A club we had never been particularly bothered about. Until they dealt us two quite horrible blows within four years, that is. </p> <p>That brilliant Shilton side of 1993/94 didn't have many off-days that season, but they chose to have one on the very day it mattered most - the second leg of the play-off semi-final. Burnley had finished 12 points below us, yet they were still in with a shout of denying us the promotion we so thoroughly deserved. (Well, we did!)</p> <p>A 0-0 draw in Lancashire set things up nicely for a triumphant night at Home Park, after which promotion would be assured with a victory over Stockport at Wembley. Dwight Marshall fired us into an early lead, and most of the home crowd were already planning their trips to the capital. </p> <p>The rest now becomes too painful to recount, but the gist of it is that Burnley scored three goals without reply before the night was out, and then went on to secure promotion at Wembley. Four years later - after two seasons back in the Second Division - we were unceremoniously dumped back into the basement by none other than bloody Burnley.</p> <p>\"Chim-chiminee, chim-chiminee, chim-chim, cheroo, we hate those . . .\"</p> <p><strong>Last fixture</strong></p> <p>Argyle 3, Chesterfield 0. This was described as a \"shock\" result by almost everyone - they obviously aren't aware of our irresistible home form. Since Paul Sturrock took the helm last November, we haven't lost a league match at Home Park - drawing only two at that. It's away from Plymouth that we become a mediocre mid-table side. </p> <p><strong>Next fixture</strong></p> <p>Tuesday night brings Hull City to Home Park, and now that the Tigers have been saved from extinction, they might start losing again. [Note: the match ended 1-1.] </p> <p>Argyle travel to fashionable Scunthorpe on Saturday, and have absolutely no chance in hell of coming away with the three points. (You won't catch me tempting fate.)</p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>Argyle don't travel well, and it's really starting to get on our nerves. The Pilgrims have now gone a hair-tearing sixteen months without a victory outside of Devon - only managing a brace of victories at local rivals Exeter and Torquay.</p> <p>Paul Sturrock has even gone as far as to select two different sides for home and away matches in an attempt to pull that elusive victory out of the bag. It's just a shame that one of those sides can't be Brazil.</p> <p><strong>What's the chairman like?</strong></p> <p>When chairman Dan McCauley finally hangs up his ego in the Home Park boardroom, he will leave behind him enough drama to produce an entire TV mini-series. His eleven years at the helm has seen nine different managers, three relegations, one promotion, two goes at the play-offs, grandiose stadium plans aplenty, countless spats with the local press, and a disastrous performance on a Talksport phone-in that will live long in the memory.</p> <p>His relationship with the supporters is tepid at best, and the self-made millionaire has a long way to go to win back the hearts of a significant section of the Home Park faithful. The Talksport performance at the beginning of this season only served to enhance his poor reputation in the eyes of some fans. McCauley treated several callers with astonishing contempt, and went as far as to accuse one of being a member of the National Front.</p> <p>It seems McCauley learnt his lesson from that PR disaster, and has steered clear of the spotlight since that ill-advised flirt with fame, letting his manager do all the talking. He's much better at it.</p> <p><strong>Who are your rivals?</strong></p> <p>The south-west corner of England and the term \"football hotbed\" aren't often uttered in the same breath, except when proceeded by the words \"it isn't one\". Thus, encounters between Argyle and neighbours Exeter and Torquay are disappointingly low-key affairs. Exeter fans have never thrown bags of piss at us, and Torquay supporters have certainly never considered purchasing the airspace over Home Park to taunt us with airborne slurs - as Manchester City cunningly attempted recently to their beloved rivals across Manchester.</p> <p>That said, we love beating them both and have made a habit of doing so in recent seasons. Argyle have always been the biggest club out of the three: bigger ground, better support and traditionally loftier league status. It's only in recent years that our Devon neighbours have been able to convincingly question our claim that we are the pride of the county - and two seasons ago we achieved the unthinkable - finishing below both the Gulls and the Grecians for the first time in our history.</p> <p>For real passion and palpable hatred, we'd need to start playing Burnley again. Other than that, the Bristol clubs always ensure large turn-outs at Home Park, mainly due to the fact that we consider the size of both to be similar to our own. Torquay and Exeter are both small-town clubs in our eyes, and should be too small to worry about - no arrogance here!</p> <p><strong>Kit</strong></p> <p>Argyle fans take great pride in our sole status as bearers of the colour green in the English game - we don't have much else to be proud of - and many were shocked at the club's decision to play in a home strip of white this season. Alright, so the white of the shirt is punctuated by green pinstripes, but the fact remains that you wouldn't catch Manchester United or Liverpool wearing anything but red on their own patch, and could you imagine Celtic ever dropping their famous green? The latest news though, is that green will be making a comeback in next season's home strip - and the fans are to be given the chance to decide exactly what the players will run-out in next season.</p> <p><strong>Club mascot</strong></p> <p>Word has it that kind-hearted Argyle officials once dished out free match tickets to residents of the local mental hospital. That practice ceased some years ago, but one of those lucky few somehow managed to slip through the net, and continues to take advantage of the club's sense of community spirit.</p> <p>Disguising himself as Yosemite Sam, the canny loon spends his Saturday afternoons rocking back and forth in the centre circle, and scaring young children with his hare-brained antics. Pilgrim Pete - as he calls himself - marked his sixth season as Plymouth Argyle's official mascot by bundling over Cheltenham's Robin-type thing, his first run-in with one of his peers and his only brush with controversy to date. He's harmless enough, but the way he prances around the place, you'd think someone had stuck a hot pasty in his pants - bless him. </p> <p><strong>Merchandise</strong></p> <p>It's a shame the world's poverty stricken countries couldn't find a use for Pilgrim Pete teapots - the Argyle club shop has got thousands of the bloody things, and no one seems to want them here.</p> <p><strong>Home Park heroes</strong></p> <p>Rapidly playing his way into the Plymouth Argyle hall of fame is Frenchman David Friio. Signed until the end of the season by Paul Sturrock, the former FC Valence midfielder is improving by the game, and Argyle fans everywhere will be urging the club to offer him a permanent contract when the curtain comes down on the current campaign. Friio is composure personified, and makes Des Lynam look like Norman Wisdom on speed.</p> <p>When it comes to true heroes though, no Argyle player in recent years has come close to achieving the status of one Tommy Tynan, Plymouth's favourite scouser. 120 goals spread across six seasons during the 80s remains a painful reminder of just what we've been missing for the past decade, and the number nine shirt has yet to be filled in quite so spectacular a fashion.</p> <p>Favourite sons still plying their trade in the game include Manchester City defender Andy 'Jock' Morrison, who would receive a red-carpet return if he decided to finish his career where it began more than a decade ago, Mark Patterson, a hugely popular right-back cruelly stolen from us by Gillingham, and Marc Edworthy, now at Coventry City.</p> <p><strong>Home Park villains</strong></p> <p>Argyle supporters can moan with the best of them, but no member of the current squad is a regular target for the boo-boys. </p> <p>By far and away the least popular player ever to don the green shirt is the now retired centre-back Peter Swan. Peter Shilton signed the bastard for a club record \u00a3350,000 from Port Vale, during the close season after we missed out on promotion to the First Division. Swan was regarded as the final piece in the jigsaw, and expectations were sky high, especially when Swan scored an early goal in our first match of the new season at home to Brentford.</p> <p>That perfect start proved to be a false dawn though, and a more accurate sign of things to come was evident in Brentford going on to score five goals without reply. That season ended in totally unexpected relegation, and Swan was bundled off to Burnley - a match made in heaven in the eyes of Argyle's supporters. As soon as he was safely away from Devon, Swan launched a scathing attack on the club, the city, its supporters and even fate itself.</p> <p>Swan's dog died during that miserable season, a misfortune he tried to blame on his move south. Which makes him nuts, as well as crap.</p> <p><strong>Home Park is where the heart is</strong></p> <p>It's taken us the best part of a decade, but it looks like Argyle will finally be joining the band of lower division clubs touching up their grounds. After several false dawns - most of which involved potential deals with supermarkets - it seems Home Park will finally be opening its eyes to the modern era.</p> <p>Work on an 18,500, all-seater revamp of the old stadium should start in the summer, and one of the biggest grounds in the lower divisions will also become one of the best within a couple of years.</p> <p>Traditionalists will miss Home Park in its current guise, but the truth is the place is in dire need of a facelift. Crumbling paint-work and ancient turnstiles might be some people's idea of a good old-fashioned day out, but the makeover is long overdue.</p> <p><strong>The Argyle experience</strong></p> <p>Home Park is set amidst the tranquillity of Central Park, and the hustle and bustle found at other grounds on matchday is largely conspicuous by its absence when Argyle are at home.</p> <p>The Britannia is the closest pub to the ground, and despite its newly acquired status as a Wetherspoons pub, retains the matchday atmosphere that has made it a popular haunt for both home and away supporters. The Golden Hind - the first pub you'll see coming off the A38 - serves top nosh at decent prices, and is only a 15-minute walk away from the ground. A jaunt to the city centre won't kill you, either, and you'll be rewarded with a veritable feast of pubs.</p> <p>If you're lucky enough to play us at Easter time - Brighton fans - you'll be able to soak up all the fun of the fair. Literally. Every Easter, a whole procession of barf-inducing rides rocks up and dumps itself right outside the ground's main entrance. If you can put up with the host of spotty teenagers hanging out and trying to shag each other in the bumper cars, then it's an ideal way to waste a few pre-match minutes. (If I see any ugly Brighton fans alone in those bumper cars this Easter, I'll be sure to point you out to all and sundry as boisterously as I can.)</p> <p><strong>What does the future hold for the Greens?</strong></p> <p>Cautious optimism are very much the key words. Paul Sturrock has impressed all with his no-nonsense approach to management, and has the hopes of Argyle's long-suffering faithful firmly in his hands. If he can find an answer to our away day blues, we will be up there next season.</p> <p>As for the long-term, much depends on Dan McCauley to ensure that any on the pitch success is matched by an ambitious response from the boardroom. We've seen the guy do some crazy things over the years, and if he really wants to earn the recognition he craves, he will be well-advised to deliver on any promises he makes from now on.</p> <p>If the promising Sturrock-McCauley relationship continues to prosper, Plymouth Argyle Football Club may finally make a name for itself. When it happens, it will have been a long time coming.</p> <p><strong>Argyle links</strong></p> <p>www.argyle.org.uk - the message boards on this site are frenetic, and full of dodgy characters. www.rubofthegreens.com - the website of Rub of the Greens. www.pafc.co.uk - constantly improving official site. www.thisisplymouth.co.uk - the Plymouth Evening Herald, popular, with excellent club coverage.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The hit BBC drama Clocking Off is to be moved to a midweek slot following mounting concern about the performance of key dramas on Sunday night. BBC director of drama Alan Yentob confirmed the second series of the seven-parter starring Sarah Lancashire would be moved from the slot because he wanted to protect it from ITV's big Sunday night shows. \"Looking at the figures, we feel it would fit better in a midweek slot,\" said Mr Yentob. His decision will cause controversy as it comes only days after Clocking Off creator Paul Abbott said he felt audiences would \"stick with\" the drama in a Sunday night slot. BBC bosses are sensitive about another high-profile failure after recent flops including Take a Girl Like You and Rebel Heart. Mr Yentob said the BBC was still \"incredibly proud\" of Clocking Off, which in its last series attracted audiences of up to 11m. He denied the Sunday night battleground was a headache for the BBC, saying dramas like Monarch of the Glen and the Warren Clarke vehicle Down to Earth were providing \"green shoots\". But he hinted at a shift towards more populist drama scheduled in midweek slots. \"There is room for more shows of some ambition which nevertheless connect with audiences in mid-range, midweek slots,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>It's half past nine in the morning, and a crowd of German tourists has come to look at Elsie Avery's home in Canterbury. She is 88, a retired Margate patisserie worker, and the reason 30 Dusseldorf schoolteachers are taking photographs of her front door is that she lives at St John's Hospital Almshouses - built in 1084 to provide housing for the elderly, and still fulfilling that function some nine centuries later. </p> <p>Like all the other 33 residents at St John's, Elsie has her own key to her own flat, looking out over a courtyard that is altogether more Oxbridge than OAP. From one window, she can see the spires of Canterbury cathedral; from the other, the lopsided Tudor gatehouse - through which she pops to the shops - and the Norman refectory and 11th-century privy. </p> <p>She appreciates the photogenic surroundings, but what she really likes about living at St John's is that it allows her to retain her independence, while at the same time feel part of a community. \"I've got my own place, my own things - and plenty of company if I want it\", she says. \"The great thing is, though, there's no one telling me what to do.\" </p> <p>Such enthusiasm is increasingly echoed elsewhere. Almshouses are far from a thing of the past: the number of places they offer is rising by 5-10% a year. \"The majority of almshouse charities in this country are in a state of expansion or refurbishment,\" says Anthony Leask, assistant director of the Almshouse Association. \"We expect to see that increase continuing, given that the number of pensioners will go up by 50% over the next 30 years.\" </p> <p>The word \"independence\" keeps coming up among residents. Elsie Avery and seven fellow residents are at the weekly coffee morning not because they have been herded into the common room, but because they have chosen to come. They're not big on organised activities here. </p> <p>\"We made a conscious decision not to put a television in the common room,\" says St John's bursar, Richard Akister, a former bank manager. \"People have TV sets in their own flat. We are very much not a nursing home, and very much not the kind of place where people are wheeled in front of the box and left there all day.\" </p> <p>The kind of place it is, though, is a peculiar mixture of modern commercial concern and medieval charity. St John's brings in \u00a350,000 a year from renting out the dozen shops that line the almshouse frontage, in the city's busy Northgate. It also gets interest on money that has been invested for five centuries; it even gets \u00a313.33 annually from Henry II, who granted it 25 groats a year in perpetuity as a kind of royal community service following his part in the Thomas \u00e0 Becket murder in 1170. </p> <p>The upshot of all this is that, like the other 1,750 almshouses in Britain, St John's offers residents private sheltered accommodation at a distinctly subsidised rate. The weekly rent of \u00a346.50 (\u00a372.50 for the more modern flats) is less than half of what people would pay on the open market. And if they were to try to buy a leasehold flat in a sheltered scheme, it would cost \u00a350,000-\u00a390,000 plus up to \u00a35,000 a year in service charges. </p> <p>For their rent, the residents of St John's get to live in an environment which is not only safe, friendly and picture-postcard pretty, but also has a care manager (to help liaise with health and social services departments) and a gate leading straight into Sainsbury's. In fact, the St John's trustees helped fund a new \u00a31m residential wing by selling some of the back garden to the supermarket. </p> <p>There are three main qualifications for residence: you must be over 65, have some link with Canterbury (work or family) and be unable to afford proper housing. A church connection can come in handy. Resident Anne Green, 89, was the warden of a clergy house throughout her working life, while Pat and Joyce Barry, both 85 and the scheme's only married couple, ran a diocesan retreat. </p> <p>Indeed, there is a well-attended medieval chapel at St John's - as at its fellow almshouse, St Nicholas, in nearby Harbledown, which was set up in the 12th century as a hilltop community for lepers. Its church was built with a sloping floor to aid sluicing and disinfecting following a service. </p> <p>In 1276, there were as many as 100 lepers living at St Nicholas, known then as the Hospital of the Wood of Blean. But as leprosy began to die out towards the end of the 14th century, the community admitted those whose afflictions were limited to old age and poverty. Today, St Nicholas has just 14 residents, who look out over rolling Kent countryside. The ancient church bell summons them the 50 yards to services. \"You don't have to be a Christian to live at either St John's or St Nicholas,\" says Akister. \"But you do need to feel comfortable in a group of people who are.\" </p> <p>You don't need to be female, either, but women outnumber men by three to one - a figure mirrored throughout the estimated 40,000 almshouse population in the UK. </p> <p>One notable exception is Sutton's Hospital (with the medieval connotation of hospitality rather than illness), in London's Charterhouse Square. All 40 of its residents - or \"brothers\", as they are called - are men, aged between 60 and 96. They pay \u00a3130 a week for their own Tudor bedsit, meals and laundry included. </p> <p>The almshouse is less than 100 yards from the plush Barbican estate and Smithfield meat market, but it is set in beautiful, cloistered surroundings. It is funded by the bequest of Elizabethan industrialist Thomas Sutton, who made a fortune from coal mining and money lending. Before his death in 1611, he arranged that all his worldly wealth should be used to set up a school for bright young boys (Charterhouse, now in Godalming, Surrey) and an almshouse for needy old gentlemen. Among the first to take up residence was George Fenner, one of Francis Drake's sea captains. </p> <p>Such was the extent of Sutton's wealth that, for four centuries, the trustees have been able to run the almshouse on the interest earned. Likewise, St John's in Canterbury has made good use of the lands and property it was given by its founder, Archbishop Lanfranc, in the 11th century. It also did well in the 20th century, when it sold off 75 acres for the University of Kent to be built on. </p> <p>Because of their private incomes, many almshouses do not qualify for public sector money unless they can show they are doing work for which the state might otherwise pay. An example was when Trinity Hospital almshouse, in Salisbury, built a new development for frailer residents (designated \"very sheltered\" accommodation) and got half the \u00a31.1m cost from the district council and the housing corporation. </p> <p>The guiding principle at Trinity is that residents should remain under the charity's umbrella until they die. The same applies at Sutton's Hospital, where 24-hour nursing care is provided for those brothers who can no longer look after themselves. At St John's, however, as at many other almshouses, there is no such option. </p> <p> \"We have just built a new wing to house those residents who are finding their old flats hard to cope with,\" says bursar Akister. \"The older properties are so narrow it's impossible to get a Zimmer frame round the corner, and extremely difficult to fit two people into the bathroom at the same time - which makes it hard for care assistants to give residents a bath. </p> <p>\"But we make it clear to everyone who comes here that we are not a hospital or a nursing home, and that when they can no longer look after themselves they will have to leave.\" </p> <p>Opinion at the coffee morning is that totally care-dependent residents would compromise the principle of independent living. \"This is a lovely place, just as it is\", says one woman. \"We all just hope we'll go before we have to leave - if you see what I mean.\" </p> <p><strong>Age-old help</strong></p> <p> The first recorded almshouse was set up in 937, by King Athelstan, at York. Today, 1,750 almshouse charities operate in the UK, some with just three cottages, others with as many as 1,000 properties. Altogether, they provide about 30,000 homes, mostly flats or one-storey houses. </p> <p>While many of the early ones were set up by the Church, after the 16th century city livery companies, mayors and landowners stepped in. In the 19th century, industrialists also did their bit.</p>",

The president of the ruling party, Bangaru Laxman, resigned last night after an internet media company, Tehelka.com, released videotapes of him accepting 100,000 rupees (\u00a31,498). The videos portrayed a string of party, defence ministry and military officials discussing or receiving bribes to facilitate a fake arms deal. In its first reaction to the revelations, the government suspended army Major General PSK Choudhury and four other defence ministry officials who had appeared on the tapes. \"Strict action will be taken against any other official if any delinquency of conduct is established in due course,\" defence ministry spokesman PK Bandopadhyay said. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee later won the backing of the National Democratic Alliance, the ruling coalition. \"All members of the NDA coalition have expressed solidarity with the NDA,\" said Murasoli Maran, leader of a key alliance partner, the Dravida Munnethra Kazhagham party. Both houses of parliament adjourned for the day as the uproar made it impossible for anyone to be heard. Punching their fists in the air, lawmakers of the Congress party and other groups left their seats and stood before the elevated chair of the speaker, GMC Balayogi, in the Lok Sabha or lower house, pointing angrily at the ruling party lawmakers. \"There is talk in every street, the prime minister is a thief,\" several opposition members shouted in Hindi. As prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee entered the house, senior Congress party lawmaker Buta Singh and other party lawmakers shouted, \"He's a thief,\" Press Trust of India reported. After the adjournment, Mr Vajpayee told reporters, \"Let their be a discussion in the house.\" Commenting on the release of the tapes, he added, \"There is something fishy.\" VK Malhotra, a leader of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, said that no cabinet minister had been implicated in the Tehelka revelations, nd no defence deal had been finalised. \"We are ready for any sort of inquiry,\" Mr Malhotra said.

The film, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke (Steal Steal Quietly Quietly), has played to packed houses since its release last week, and has confounded recent attempts by detectives to clean up an industry famous for the murky nexus between its leading personalities and the mafia. The movie has attracted the kind of publicity that most directors could only dream of but for all the wrong reasons. Its producer, Nazeem Rizvi, is languishing in prison, accused of attempting to kill several Bollywood stars. Its financier, Bharat Shah, has been locked in a neighbouring cell since early January. Both men are accused of making the film with underworld money and of colluding with one of India's most feared mafia dons, Chhota Shakheel. It might come as some consolation to them that Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, which stars Salman Khan, India's answer to Richard Gere, has fascinated huge audiences intrigued by its underworld links. The film has all the ingredients of a Bollywood hit, including a love triangle and a patriarchal cricket-playing grandfather. \"Its got all the makings of a great entertainer,\" said Gitanjali Chaturvedi, a student, yesterday as he emerged from a three-hour showing at a plush Delhi cinema. \"It's got good singing and dancing, pretty women, exotic foreign locations, Salman Khan and backless cholis (blouses).\" Writing in the Times of India, the critic Nikhat Kazmi described it as a \"modern ode to the ancient Indian family\" and praised its\"overwhelming feel-goodness\". Not everyone is happy, though. Armed guards have been posted outside cinemas in Delhi and Bombay after members of the ultra-nationalist Shiv Sena disrupted several showings on Friday. At least 12 people have been injured and more than 200 protesters arrested following pitched battles between rightwing Hindu activists and police in several cities. Two protesters attempted suicide.

The court ruled that all profits should go to an unlikely beneficiary - the Maharashtran state government which runs Bombay.

Detectives have grilled the movie's three main stars - Salman Khan and the actresses Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee - as well as 60 other celebrities. Last week police produced a 1,800-page dossier with details of phone conversations between Mr Shah, a wealthy diamond merchant, and Mr Shakeel in which the pair allegedly plotted to extort money from a Bollywood promoter. Police also claim that Mr Rizvi used his links with Mr Shakeel to pressurise stars into agreeing to take part in the film, and the producer is accused of trying to kill India's most bankable young star, Hrithik Roshan, and his producer father Rakesh.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Gwyneth Paltrow is about to undergo a change of image. Shocking though it sounds, the slender star looks set to bloat out for a role in the Farrelly brothers' new comedy Shallow Hal. Paltrow will pull on a \"fat suit\" in order to play Jack Black's love interest in a tale about a boorish lad about town who learns to see the inner beauty of women. Empire Online quotes director Bobby Farrelly as saying that Gwyneth will play: \"A big, fat girl she's game for it. She's ready to try some new stuff.\" \u0095 Reportedly sick of playing winsome do-gooders and cuddly jesters, Robin Williams looks set for an audacious image change in his new picture too. The smirking one is in final negotiations to play a shadowy killer who blackmails Al Pacino's angst-ridden policeman in the American version of Insomnia. The remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller by Erik Skjoldbjaerg begins shooting on April 9 in Alaska with Memento creator Christopher Nolan in the director's chair. \u0095 Benjamin Bratt - still best known as Julia Roberts's latest squeeze - is in negotiations to join Dawson's Creek star Katie Holmes in the psycho-thriller Abandon. The directoral debut of Traffic writer Steve Gaghan will focus on a young woman who is haunted by visions of her ex-lover.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister this morning welcomed a fall in unemployment figures to below 1m - by announcing stringent new conditions for claiming benefits under the New Deal. Figures released today show that the number of jobless claiming the dole has fallen to below the \"benchmark\" million mark for the first time in more than 25 years. Using the fall to launch a government green paper on unemployment, Mr Blair said: \"We do not rest on our laurels. One million people, even just under one million people, is still too many out of work.\" Official figures put the jobless total at 996,200 - just 3.4% of the working age population. The government used the news to send out three of its biggest hitters - the PM, chancellor Gordon Brown and social security secretary Alistair Darling - to launch a proposal which will copy the US system by withdrawing benefits from claimants who refuse to take up one of the four options on offer. The Chancellor announced that before receiving benefit, unemployed people will have to be interviewed about job opportunities and the steps they are taking to get back into work. There will be a new compulsory \"skills check up\" for unemployed claimants and a pilot project requiring the unemployed to take up skills training. Anyone who repeatedly refuses to take part in one of the schemes will have their benefits withdrawn for up to 26 weeks. Mr Blair called the measures \"innovative and practical\", adding: \"We are willing to do whatever it takes to give people the skills, confidence and opportunities to move into work. \"We are on a genuine crusade to achieve full employment. \"That is why we are setting out the next steps on jobs with a package of proposals on employment aimed at helping disadvantaged people in disadvantaged communities open up the pathways to work.\" Mr Brown added: \"I want every child in every part of Britain as they get up for school every morning, to see a whole community around them getting up and going to work.\" Mr Blair said that for generations people had dreamt about returning to full employment and added: \"That dream is now within our grasp.\" Mr Blair said the government's focus would now switch to people who had been considered as unable to work, including lone parents, partners of the unemployed, and many disabled people. There had been very little support for these groups of unemployed. Mr Brown said the claimant count had now fallen by 667,000 since the last election while the International Labour Organisation total - which still puts the total unemployed in the UK as above one million - was down by 556,000. During the same period the number of people in work has increased by almost 1.2m. The number of job vacancies has also increased by 40% since 1997. Mr Brown said it was the toughness of the New Deal which had helped 270,000 young people into work. He said: \"It is the new rights and new responsibilities of the second stage of the New Deal that will move us closer to our ambition of full employment.\" Mr Brown said \u00a3120m will be spent over the next three years creating action teams in areas hardest hit by unemployment. Another \u00a3200m a year will be spent on offering training and advice to the long-term unemployed. A \u00a340 million programme will be launched to help 30,000 reformed drug addicts find a job. Mr Brown added: \"Full employment is not just an economic cause that will make the economy more efficient.

At the top of the ladder sit Jack Dee and Claire Sweeney, interestingly the only people in the house who could in any way be described as being talented; this reflects itself in their groundedness. Dee's straightness and lack of showbiz bullshit (hilariously, he nominated Vanessa Feltz for eviction \"because she keeps banging on about what a good cause it's for, and it's getting boring\") and Sweeney's amazingly saucy blue-collar charm sent them up in my estimation considerably - and in the case of Miss Sweeney, nearly made me question my sexuality all over again. She is obviously that one-in-a-million actor who is not at all thick, conceited or graceless as well as being the embodiment of a peculiarly Scouse sex appeal - sly, fly, self-mocking - and the perfection of her figure in her tight jeans and little tops is a revelation after all those years of Lindsay Corkhill's depressing chip-shop overalls. In short, phwooar! </p> <p>In the middle of the pecking order we have Keith Duffy, the ex-pop singer and Chris Eubank, the ex-boxer, now both obviously hoping for some sort of gig in the meejah - \"presenting\", probably. Ah, \"presenting\" - the Holy Grail of the modern micro-celebrity. The growth of satellite television has created a boom town for the legions of media wannabes who have ambition but no talent, and sometimes it seems that every ex-page three girl, sports starlet or celebrity wife is bent on a job \"presenting\". (One day, surely, we'll run out of programmes for them to present, and the end result will be Presenters Presenting Presenters.) </p> <p>These jobs seem attractive, especially to someone who is all attention-seeking and no skills, but for that very reason they are lethal, especially for women. Relying as they do on being rather than doing, on appearance rather than talent, the presenter remains in the permanent state of a prostitute lined up in a bordello, for ever projecting her hopefully superior charms in order to get the punter's money. And, of course, there is always someone younger, blonder, cuter coming up on the inside ...</p> <p>The pathos of the short-term presenter is summed up heartbreakingly in the persons of Anthea Turner and Vanessa Feltz, the twin occupants of the lowest rung of the Big Brother ladder; as they fall apart - Vanessa messily and swiftly, Anthea more photogenically and professionally - it is horribly compelling, like watching a John Cassavetes film or hearing your neighbours' marriage break up in gory detail through the wall. They are the flimsiest, most damaged and most compelling creatures in the house, with none of the confidence born of talent that Dee and Sweeney possess, or the dumb macho swagger of Eubank and Duffy. Even their names - 19th-century literary inventions - seem to mock their lack of substance and roots. </p> <p>The interesting thing about the famous is always the gap between \"personality\" - that which is touted to the public - and character, the raw, pink squirming thing inside the carapace. Both Turner and Feltz are perfect examples of people whose public personalities are the exact opposite of their real selves. Turner's cleaner than clean persona all along masked a woman completely driven by sex, while Feltz's wacky, madcap persona hides a woman of profound melancholy. </p> <p>I often wondered why she pulled that hideously unattractive, pop-eyed rictus grin in every photograph taken of her, and now I understand; in repose, her face is simply the saddest I've ever seen, with the clownishly downturned mouth of the tragedy mask and restless, rejected eyes. People say of certain fat women - Dawn French is another - \"Oh, she'd be so pretty if she lost weight,\" but in Vanessa's case the melted layers of fat have revealed a face that expresses little more than confusion and dismay. </p> <p>The terrible precariousness of the professional presenters' position was revealed in the reactions of Turner and Feltz to their eviction nominations; tears. Tears, from two educated, adult women in their 40s! What is their mental age, you have to wonder? And what sort of psyche is so desperately dependent on the kindness of strangers that its withdrawal can actually make them cry real tears? If these people are not actually clinically depressed now, it can't be long before they are. </p> <p>I'm inclined to blame punk; it was the punk ethos, after all, which preached that talent, creativity and charisma were unnecessary, and that wanting it was everything. Feltz is the logical end product of an age in which ambition is valued more highly than skills. Paradoxically, the piece of work that has caused Feltz the most distress is also the best piece of decent TV she's ever been involved in. Suddenly we could see what she was for ; singularly ungifted as a talk-show host and television presenter, she has come into her own as a sort of modern morality play about where the pursuit of fame for fame's sake gets you. Dee and Sweeney aside, it's hard to believe that anyone in the house will ever do anything that makes such an impression on the collective consciousness again, which is in itself a comment on the flimsiness of their alleged careers. The original Big Brother occupants were allowed to sink back into obscurity after their brief day in the Sun; by the time the repercussions from this melee die down, obscurity will seem infinitely seductive to these prancing, damaged puppets, who only ever really wanted love.

Take the sure-fire car-crash appeal of the Big Brother format and stick it in a blender with the celebrity-snooping that threatens to consume western society in a vast vat of froth.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is believed to have hired Unilever foods marketer Andy Duncan as director of marketing and communications to replace Matthew Bannister. Mr Bannister quit the post in October after only six months in charge of the corporation's \u00a373m marketing budget. Since his departure speculation has been rife about his successor. Former BBC director of corporate marketing Jane Frost and Channel 5 marketing director Jim Hytner were both approached about the job. Mr Duncan, 38, is category director, spreads and cooking products for Unilever Bestfoods Europe, which is based in Belgium. He was previously marketing director for Van den Burgh's chilled food brands, having worked within Unilever for 16 years. The BBC will be hoping Mr Duncan will bring some stability to its 400-strong marketing department, which has been rocked by restructuring and the departure of several senior marketers including marketing director Sue Farr last April. A BBC spokeswoman said no appointment has been made.

      "body": "<p>The thriller writer Robert Ludlum, who has died of a heart attack aged 73, in the gulf coast town of Naples, Florida, was one of a handful of authors who invented and came to define airport fiction. He enjoyed a 30-year writing career in which, according to his publisher, he sold more than 210m copies of his 21 novels.</p> <p>Put crudely, Ludlum was the fictional arm of the globalisation of American culture. Before him, its popular fiction had been rooted in established genres - westerns, crime fiction, historical romance, sub-James Bond spy thrillers. Like Arthur Hailey and Tom Clancy, Ludlum blasted aside such boundaries, mirroring, as he did so, the rise of the modern Hollywood blockbuster. And yet he did not write his first novel, The Scarlatti Inheritance (1971), until he was in his 40s.</p> <p>Ludlum was born in New York, and grew up in Short Hills, New Jersey. He left home as a teenager in 1941 and, getting a part in a touring play, tried to make it as an actor. His parents soon rescued him from Broadway, after which he spent two years with the US Marine Corps in the Pacific in the aftermath of the second world war. He then attended Wesleyan University, in Connecticut, where he met his actress wife, Mary Ryducha.</p> <p>Together they went into the theatre, where Ludlum spent the next two decades working as an actor, with minor roles on television and on Broadway, and then as a producer, running what was allegedly America's first shopping-mall theatre, the Playhouse, in Paramus, New Jersey. In 1960, he produced The Owl And The Pussycat, using a then unknown actor named Alan Alda.</p> <p>Having a famously deep voice, Ludlum also made some money doing voice-overs on the side; he once claimed that uttering the words \"Plunge works fast\", in a toilet cleaner commercial, put one of his sons through college. When the theatre business began to pall, he quit to write his first novel.</p> <p>The key ingredients were there from the start - a grand conspiracy, and forces of unimaginable evil that only one individual could thwart. The Scarlatti Inheritance was a preposterous, yet compelling, yarn revolving around the notion that, back in the 1920s, a worldwide cabal of high-ranking Nazi sympathisers made a plan to ensure world domination. At the heart of the plan is a child called Ulster, reared specially for the job and now ready to go into action. There is only one person who can stop him - his mother.</p> <p>The book was an immediate success, and Ludlum followed it up with a book a year through the 1970s, each one with the same signature-title construction. The Osterman Weekend (1972) was filmed (unmemorably) by Sam Peckinpah. The Bourne Identity (1980), perhaps the pick of the bunch, has just been filmed, with Matt Damon in the lead. One after another, the titles continued to sell more than 20m each, Ludlum's readers apparently happy enough despite the fact that his formula was becoming ever more transparent and repetitive.</p> <p>Today, it has become the critical norm to rubbish Ludlum and his ilk as purveyors of semi-literate, rightwing tosh. This is unfair on several counts. For a start, no one survives long in popular fiction without having the ability to keep the pages turning. Secondly, Ludlum was not the rightwinger people tend to take mass-market thriller writers to be - the gung-ho Clancy is actually the exception to the rule. Indeed, Ludlum frequently cited living through the red-baiting McCarthy years as a key influence on his plots, which often revolved around neo-Nazi conspiracies and rarely evoked the \"red menace\".</p> <p>Not that Ludlum should be read as a serious political commentator in the way that one might approach Eric Ambler or John Le Carr\u00e9. He himself would probably have disparaged any such claims, being much given to remarks like, \"I don't believe that my first name is Leo, or that my last name is Tolstoy. I'm a storyteller.\"</p> <p>And that's right. His great talent was as a storyteller. Arguably, the key to Ludlum's success was precisely the fact that he took a historically political genre, the spy thriller, and turned it into pure escapism by making everything larger than life. He did this both literally - his books got longer and longer as time went on - and conceptually, since nothing less than the safety of the world was ever at stake, and the action could never be contained in a single continent. Which is part of what made him the perfect airport novelist: what better for a busy executive - or would-be executive - to read as he jets around the world than a novel that does likewise?</p> <p>The other keystone of Ludlum's popularity was painstaking research. He explained that he spent about three months on research, and about 15 months writing his books. Thanks to that, his thrillers always had the air of being written by a man in the know, an important quality in popular fiction aimed at the male reader - and Ludlum is very much a writer of boys' books - who likes a hefty amount of factual information.</p> <p>It is as if reading a novel would be an unforgivable indulgence if the reader did not learn something concrete from it; how to evade an infra-red security system, or the precise specification of the latest terrorist weapon. It is a trend that reached its logical conclusion in the work of Ludlum's successor, Clancy, whose books offer enough technical information for the reader to construct his own nuclear submarine.</p> <p>As Ludlum's prodigious pace slowed a little, following a triple bypass in the mid-1990s, he launched a series, Robert Ludlum's Covert-One, in which his fictional ideas were fleshed out with the help of a co-writer, Gayle Lynds.

But no one in boots, fleece and woolly hat could be seen on Loughrigg Fell above Ambleside and no one took the steep pull up Wansfell or strode out on the Langdale Pikes.</p> <p>If they had, they would have infringed controls designed to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease in Britain's most infected county (44 cases so far) and would have rendered themselves liable to a \u00a35,000 fine.</p> <p>Some walkers threw rucksacks over their shoulders and wandered the streets of Ambleside (pop. 3000), a town where more than half the local jobs depend on tourism. Others picked up a new leaflet offering \"tarmac walks\" on local lanes ranging from a three-mile ramble to a 15-mile \"leg ache challenge\".</p> <p>Cumbria's tourist industry is losing up to \u00a310m and 350 jobs a week, but local entrepreneurs want the world to know the Lake District is still in business. They winced at a letter sent out by the national park authority a couple of weeks ago, which said: \"Unless your visit is essential, do not visit the Lake District.\"</p> <p>That, said Chris Collier, chief executive of the Cumbria tourist board, was \"a bit over the top\". Once that message was broadcast, trade dried up \"as if a tap had been turned off\". A second letter from the authority began: \"The Lake District national park is open.\"</p> <p>\"The most popular activities in the Lake District are touring by car and exploring towns and villages,\" said Ms Collier. \"Walking comes only third. Footpaths and bridleways are closed, not the whole countryside. The landscape is still there to enjoy so long as you don't want to tramp across it.\"</p> <p>Ms Collier wants an easing of the business rate to help operators. \"We can't insure against it and businesses won't be compensated,\" she said at a crisis meeting called by the tourist board yesterday. \"People are watching their whole livelihoods being washed away needlessly.\"</p> <p>In Ambleside 10 staff, a fifth of the total, have been made redundant at Gaynor Sports, the town's biggest walking gear shop, now facing the worst crisis in its 30-year history. Don McPherson, the company's managing director, said he noticed a dramatic fall in business two weeks ago. \"They had started roping off car parks and word got round that national park land was closed to fell walkers,\" he said.</p> <p>By the end of the week trade had dropped by 50%. \"There is great apprehension,\" he added. \"People are asking how long this can go on.\"</p> <p>A couple of hundred yards away, Richard Lee was making marmalade at Kent House, the bed and breakfast he has run with his wife Margaret for seven years. \"Normally, we would be full every Friday and Saturday night throughout the year,\" he said. \"But only two rooms were booked last weekend. We have lost two thirds of our business and cancellations have cost \u00a32,000 so far.\"</p> <p>Down the road at the headquarters of Heart of the Lakes and Cottage Life, a company with 240 holiday homes to rent and an annual rental income of up to \u00a33m, staff are spending hours persuading sceptical customers not to cancel bookings.</p> <p>Brochure orders and bookings are down about 40% on last year. \"We will have to consider very carefully our next moves in terms of cutting costs,\" said Peter Jackson, a partner in the company. \"We cannot consider that things are just going to right themselves. I daren't contemplate what happens if this goes on for eight months [as in the 1967 outbreak].</p> <p>\"It's so frustrating because the tourism industry is an innocent party.

      "bodyText": "It was a beautiful day for a walk in Ambleside at the head of Windermere. But no one in boots, fleece and woolly hat could be seen on Loughrigg Fell above Ambleside and no one took the steep pull up Wansfell or strode out on the Langdale Pikes. If they had, they would have infringed controls designed to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease in Britain's most infected county (44 cases so far) and would have rendered themselves liable to a \u00a35,000 fine. Some walkers threw rucksacks over their shoulders and wandered the streets of Ambleside (pop. 3000), a town where more than half the local jobs depend on tourism. Others picked up a new leaflet offering \"tarmac walks\" on local lanes ranging from a three-mile ramble to a 15-mile \"leg ache challenge\". Cumbria's tourist industry is losing up to \u00a310m and 350 jobs a week, but local entrepreneurs want the world to know the Lake District is still in business. They winced at a letter sent out by the national park authority a couple of weeks ago, which said: \"Unless your visit is essential, do not visit the Lake District.\" That, said Chris Collier, chief executive of the Cumbria tourist board, was \"a bit over the top\". Once that message was broadcast, trade dried up \"as if a tap had been turned off\". A second letter from the authority began: \"The Lake District national park is open.\" \"The most popular activities in the Lake District are touring by car and exploring towns and villages,\" said Ms Collier. \"Walking comes only third. Footpaths and bridleways are closed, not the whole countryside. The landscape is still there to enjoy so long as you don't want to tramp across it.\" Ms Collier wants an easing of the business rate to help operators. \"We can't insure against it and businesses won't be compensated,\" she said at a crisis meeting called by the tourist board yesterday. \"People are watching their whole livelihoods being washed away needlessly.\" In Ambleside 10 staff, a fifth of the total, have been made redundant at Gaynor Sports, the town's biggest walking gear shop, now facing the worst crisis in its 30-year history. Don McPherson, the company's managing director, said he noticed a dramatic fall in business two weeks ago. \"They had started roping off car parks and word got round that national park land was closed to fell walkers,\" he said. By the end of the week trade had dropped by 50%. \"There is great apprehension,\" he added. \"People are asking how long this can go on.\" A couple of hundred yards away, Richard Lee was making marmalade at Kent House, the bed and breakfast he has run with his wife Margaret for seven years. \"Normally, we would be full every Friday and Saturday night throughout the year,\" he said. \"But only two rooms were booked last weekend. We have lost two thirds of our business and cancellations have cost \u00a32,000 so far.\" Down the road at the headquarters of Heart of the Lakes and Cottage Life, a company with 240 holiday homes to rent and an annual rental income of up to \u00a33m, staff are spending hours persuading sceptical customers not to cancel bookings. Brochure orders and bookings are down about 40% on last year. \"We will have to consider very carefully our next moves in terms of cutting costs,\" said Peter Jackson, a partner in the company. \"We cannot consider that things are just going to right themselves. I daren't contemplate what happens if this goes on for eight months [as in the 1967 outbreak]. \"It's so frustrating because the tourism industry is an innocent party. We are being crippled and in some cases ruined by the preventative measures. If they slaughtered every sheep in the Lake District, it wouldn't cost as much.\" Henry Walker, managing director of a caravan park at Skelwith Bridge, opened up his site on March 1. \"We had 140 caravans booked in for that first weekend,\" he said. \"One turned up.

      "bodyText": "Gone are the days when the Oscar acceptance speech was an excuse for crashing melodramatics and poetic soliloquies. If Academy guidelines are followed, this year's ceremony could play more like a Pinter drama, with prospective Oscar winners told to keep to a terse 45 seconds apiece. Last year, Michael Caine (a winner for Best Supporting Actor) took about that long just to clear his throat. The time limit was imposed at Monday's annual pre-Oscar lunch by Gil Cates, who has produced the televised Oscars for the past ten years. Over 100 nominees, among them some of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, listened as Cates gave his edict. As a slight concession, the producer said that if the winners had specific people they wished to thank, the full list could be run the next day on the Academy's official website. As Cates stepped away from the mike, a tense moment of silence was broken by hearty laughter. Meanwhile British bookmakers William Hill have closed the books on this year's Oscars. The odds are now fixed, with Julia Roberts the hot favourite to win Best Actress at 1/6, and Juliette Binoche (13/2), Joan Allen (8/1), Ellen Burstyn (9/1) and Laura Linney (16/1) trailing behind. Gladiator is in poll position to take the Best Picture award at 1/5, followed by Traffic (7/2), Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (7/1), Erin Brockovich (10/1) and Chocolat (25/1). But the bookies seem less certain over the direction of the Best Actor award. They have Russell Crowe and Tom Hanks neck and neck on 5/6 apiece. The other, less fancied nominees - Ed Harris, Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush - are tied on 16/1.",

      "body": "<p>Frank Furedi is not a relaxed parent. He can be laid-back about some things: his five-year-old son, Jacob, is encouraged to play in the woods near their family home, and Furedi hopes he will soon be able to cycle to school. But when it comes to illness, Furedi frets. He worries about his son's health. He can even quote you Jacob's temperature when he was last poorly. In short, he is paranoid - in common with all parents, he maintains. </p> <p>\"We all have our vulnerabilities, our areas of concern, our fears,\" says Furedi. \"We all have something that can be played on and opened up, and which then becomes the basis of fear in our parenting.\" </p> <p>So, Furedi is on a mission: he wants to make us aware of our paranoia so we can all cool it and be a bit more rational where looking after our kids is concerned. Thus the message of his new book, Paranoid Parenting, is: stop listening to the \"experts\"; tear up the handbook; and follow your instincts - where your child is concerned, you know best. </p> <p>Of course, there is a certain paradox to all this, since Furedi himself is a type of expert - a sociologist at the University of Kent - and before you follow his advice never to read another parenting book, he would love you to buy this one. His ideas were formed, he says, after he became a father at the relatively advanced age of 48, and discovered that parenting had changed rather a lot in the decades between his own boyhood and that of his son. </p> <p>In particular, what he noticed was that children were no longer left to their own devices. He describes it as a \"colonisation\" of the world of children by adults. As a consequence, he says, adults not only inhabit but control the lives of children to an alarming and unhealthy extent. </p> <p>For Furedi, whose 1997 book The Culture of Fear examined the way risk is perceived in society, the most obvious manifestation of this control centres on fears about children's safety. The real risks, he argues, are magnified by irrational fears; and so kids' freedom and creativity are being limited. While Jacob is encouraged to play outside the Furedis' home in Faversham, Kent, many children are kept indoors - out of harm's way. But the harm, Furedi would have us believe, is largely imagined: yes, we read a lot about child abduction, murder and paedophilia, but the risks to our own children from these evils are minuscule. Our fears are fed by study after alarm-bell-ringing study alerting us to this or that childhood danger. Furedi disputes the idea that most of these studies originate in universities like his own. In fact, he says, many are market research reports masquerading as more serious analyses. The media are the villains of the piece, and here there is a whiff of Furedi's past as a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, whose magazine Living Marxism had an unerring instinct for controversy and an abiding contempt for the \"bourgeois press\". But the result, he says, is a generation of parents who believe that their children are at real risk, and who are overreacting in their efforts to protect them. </p> <p>\"When I ask people why they limit their children's activities in a particular way,\" says Furedi, \"they always say, 'I couldn't live with myself if anything happened.' In other words, they're talking about themselves, not about their children.\" </p> <p>All this worry, he believes, is casting a shadow over family life. Take cot death, for example. Furedi says that when he and his wife, Ann, were expecting Jacob, the risks of cot death were often mentioned. \"Every mother I know admits to having worried at some point that their child is at risk,\" he notes. \"It's emblematic of the campaign that we've created.\" </p> <p>The effect of this climate of fear on parents is exacerbated by the fact that more and more is expected from them, argues Furedi: \"Take education: today's parents are expected to be amateur teachers, involved in every part of their children's schoolwork. It's certainly not enough to leave it to the school. I think that degrades education, because it means politicians can ignore the problems of schools. </p> <p>\"What I'm saying is that we've established this culture in which parents have a direct sense of responsibility for everything that happens to their children. What this means is that we've lost our autonomy.\" </p> <p>Furedi thinks that because we now feel we have to take responsibility for every part of our children's lives, we take every threat to their safety too seriously. \"It's not worth altering your behaviour and being on red alert for what are relatively small risks,\" he maintains. \"We've got to accept that life contains risks and it's far better to be aware of them than to let them enslave our lives.\" </p> <p>The counter-argument to all this is that today's parents are more knowledgeable about certain areas of parenting and more involved in their children's lives than parents in the 50s and 60s. But Furedi is having none of this. First, he says, it is naive to argue that the information we are being fed about, say, health risks in pregnancy is widening our choice or improving our parenting; in fact they often lead to enforced conformity. \"Take the US, where in some areas pregnant women can be arrested for drinking in public,\" he says. \"What begins as advice ends up as coercion.\" </p> <p>Furedi concedes that there may be a positive aspect to parents being more involved in the lives of their children, but adds that: \"The danger is, it becomes compulsive. What starts as involvement becomes this infinite process, and you lose the ability to draw a line between what your children should be doing on their own and what adults should be doing.\" </p> <p>Furedi describes his own childhood - he grew up in Hungary in the 50s - as a happy one, despite a lack of material wealth and a father who had to work a 60-hour week. Interestingly, he admits that his mother, who had survived imprisonment in a concentration camp, was overprotective. His own desire to be hands-off about Jacob's upbringing, and to persuade the rest of us to take the same approach, is at least partly a reaction to that. \"Our own parents probably did a reasonable job given the constraints they were under, and I don't think it's helpful to criticise them.\" </p> <p>Furedi denies that he is harking back to a golden age when parents left their kids to get on with growing up and did not meddle so much (although it is difficult to dismiss entirely the thought that, somewhere inside, he does believe that today's kids are worse off than previous generations). What he says is that there is no model from the past for good practice in parenting: every generation has to deal with the difficulties around it and do the best it can. But the bottom line is: if we stopped trying so hard, we would make a better job of bringing up our kids - and if we ignored most of the advice we are bombarded with, we would do a better job still. </p> <p>\u0095 Paranoid Parenting by Frank Furedi is published by Penguin Press.

      "body": "<p>The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, easily won the country's hard-fought presidential election today, but his main challenger demanded a new poll after rejecting the vote.</p> <p>With results declared from all but 14 of 17,308 polling stations, Mr Museveni has taken 69.3% of the vote. The electoral commission said that his rival, Kizza Besigye, has just 27.8%.</p> <p>\"Therefore, President Yoweri Museveni is declared the winner of the 2001 presidential elections,\" commission chairman Aziz Kasujja announced.</p> <p>Mr Besigye has already rejected the outcome. \"I write to inform you that my task force and I vehemently reject the ... election results that are now being declared by your commission and demand fresh elections,\" Mr Besigye said in a letter to the today.</p> <p>\"We will not meekly submit to those who want to govern without the people's mandate, we shall resist them,\" he said. \"We consider the results being declared null and void.\"</p> <p>Mr Museveni was widely expected to win a final five-year term as leader of the east African nation, but the poll was hit by reports of vote-rigging and intimidation of Mr Besigye's supporters.</p> <p>Mr Museveni's campaign spokesman, information minister Basoga Nsadhu, said that his candidate had won fairly.</p> <p>\"He (Besigye) should accept that he has been defeated,\" Mr Nsadhu said.</p> <p>Mr Besigye has said that his agents had been chased from many polling stations or detained by the army during the voting. He also accused Mr Museveni's supporters of voting more than once.</p> <p>Armed police were patrolling the streets of Kampala today, but no incidents were reported.</p> <p>Mr Kasujja confirmed that he had received two letters from Mr Besigye's camp complaining about the electoral process.</p> <p>\"It is Besigye's right to deny the results because everybody has the right to complain. But people voted during the day and the votes were counted in broad daylight - I do not accept that there was rigging,\" he said.</p> <p>Some international observers have said that they believed there were irregularities in some parts of the country.</p> <p>\"In a lot of places there was very little to be concerned about,\" noted one. \"In some places there was a lot to be concerned about.\"</p> <p>Local monitors have said that such irregularities may have \"seriously compromised\" the election.</p> <p>\"There have been various cases of irregularities and of particular concern are the districts of Rukingiri, Kabale, Mbale and Soroti,\" said Pam Okille-Etiang of poll monitors NEMGROUP.</p> <p>\"We have asked the EC (electoral commission) to investigate and seriously consider a rerun in these districts. The question we are now discussing is whether these irregularities have seriously compromised the whole election,\" Ms Okille-Etiang continued.</p> <p>Mr Museveni took power as the head of a guerrilla in 1986. He was elected as president a decade later. He ended a period for Uganda under dictators Idi Amin and Milton Obote, during which hundreds of thousands of the country's people were tortured and killed.</p> <p>Mr Museveni is credited with rebuilding the economy, introducing free education, improving women's situation and bringing Aids under control. He is also responsible for banning political parties, which he blamed for ethnic and sectarian hatred.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.africanews.com/monitor\" target=\"_new\">The Monitor</a><br><a href=\"http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ug.html\" target=\"_new\">CIA factbook on Uganda</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, easily won the country's hard-fought presidential election today, but his main challenger demanded a new poll after rejecting the vote. With results declared from all but 14 of 17,308 polling stations, Mr Museveni has taken 69.3% of the vote. The electoral commission said that his rival, Kizza Besigye, has just 27.8%. \"Therefore, President Yoweri Museveni is declared the winner of the 2001 presidential elections,\" commission chairman Aziz Kasujja announced. Mr Besigye has already rejected the outcome. \"I write to inform you that my task force and I vehemently reject the ... election results that are now being declared by your commission and demand fresh elections,\" Mr Besigye said in a letter to the today. \"We will not meekly submit to those who want to govern without the people's mandate, we shall resist them,\" he said. \"We consider the results being declared null and void.\" Mr Museveni was widely expected to win a final five-year term as leader of the east African nation, but the poll was hit by reports of vote-rigging and intimidation of Mr Besigye's supporters. Mr Museveni's campaign spokesman, information minister Basoga Nsadhu, said that his candidate had won fairly. \"He (Besigye) should accept that he has been defeated,\" Mr Nsadhu said. Mr Besigye has said that his agents had been chased from many polling stations or detained by the army during the voting. He also accused Mr Museveni's supporters of voting more than once. Armed police were patrolling the streets of Kampala today, but no incidents were reported. Mr Kasujja confirmed that he had received two letters from Mr Besigye's camp complaining about the electoral process. \"It is Besigye's right to deny the results because everybody has the right to complain. But people voted during the day and the votes were counted in broad daylight - I do not accept that there was rigging,\" he said. Some international observers have said that they believed there were irregularities in some parts of the country. \"In a lot of places there was very little to be concerned about,\" noted one. \"In some places there was a lot to be concerned about.\" Local monitors have said that such irregularities may have \"seriously compromised\" the election. \"There have been various cases of irregularities and of particular concern are the districts of Rukingiri, Kabale, Mbale and Soroti,\" said Pam Okille-Etiang of poll monitors NEMGROUP. \"We have asked the EC (electoral commission) to investigate and seriously consider a rerun in these districts. The question we are now discussing is whether these irregularities have seriously compromised the whole election,\" Ms Okille-Etiang continued. Mr Museveni took power as the head of a guerrilla in 1986. He was elected as president a decade later. He ended a period for Uganda under dictators Idi Amin and Milton Obote, during which hundreds of thousands of the country's people were tortured and killed. Mr Museveni is credited with rebuilding the economy, introducing free education, improving women's situation and bringing Aids under control. He is also responsible for banning political parties, which he blamed for ethnic and sectarian hatred. Useful links The Monitor CIA factbook on Uganda",

Well-placed insiders said the network will finally appear on the BSkyB platform after signing a \u00a3100m satellite broadcasting deal. \"The intention is to conclude a deal with Sky for conditional access to its platform so that ITV can become part of the Sky package,\" said one source. It will mean viewers who already subscribe to Sky no longer have to go through the irritating process of switching from satellite back to conventional TV services to watch ITV programmes. It will also boost ITV's ratings significantly - its share of viewing had dropped significantly in Sky homes because viewers couldn't be bothered to switch back to conventional TV to tune in to ITV. The source added that both sides \"have the will to strike a deal\", although negotiations will be \"very tough.\" It is an open secret that ITV and BSkyB have clashed over the price of using Sky's conditional access system, with ITV insiders claiming the \u00a320m-a-year price is too steep. However, industry sources said a deal was \"entirely feasible\", as Channel 4 managed to put its E4 channel on Sky Digital after just five days of negotiations. \"ITV needs to go on Sky Digital, because it needs an electronic programming guide listing in order to be accessed by viewers and conditional access technology,\" said one source. ITV today struck a deal with Luxembourg-based satellite group Societe Europeenne des Satellites to broadcast on digital satellite for the next 10 years. Viewers will be able to pick up local programmes because ITV is broadcast 16 different versions of the TV network in keeping with its regional obligations.

      "body": "<p>The perpetual onslaught against working mothers rears its ugly head again today with the publication of a study from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which implies that under-fives with full-time working mothers are less likely to grow up into successful A-level students than those whose mothers work part-time or stay at home. The research has found that those who didn't work increased the chances of their children getting one A-level by 12%, while those who worked part time increased their children's chances by 6%. </p> <p>All research needs to be treated with scepticism. This was a study of 1,236 people born in the 1970s, when times were very different. Working mothers were rarer; high-quality daycare was almost nonexistent; and our knowledge of the psychological development of under-fives was scant. There were no early music classes, no dance or drama workshops, and few nursery schools with Montessori equipment encouraging the basic learning skills that we take for granted today. </p> <p>A great deal happens in children's lives between the ages of five and 18 that can affect their attitudes to education; without knowing their individual life stories, it is hard to tell surely whether they would have dropped out or failed A-levels anyway. It is obvious, but no less striking, that the children of educated working mothers stood a better chance of getting A-levels than those lower down the social scale. </p> <p>John Ermisch, co-author of the report with Marco Francesconi at the University of Essex, agrees that other factors inevitably influence educational outcomes: \"There are a lot of other things that you can't control, but I was a bit surprised by the size of the difference. My preconception was that what parents did with their time when they were not working would muddy the waters so much that the difference would be less.\" </p> <p>For every research paper that suggests working motherhood damages children, others indicate more positive effects on the social and cognitive development of children. At the Institute of Child Health, Ian Roberts con ducted a systematic review of childcare research and found that, on balance, it was good for children, provided they were in high-quality care. A trained nursery worker, able to stimulate and excite a child with a wide variety of educational toys for part of the day, is likely to be of far greater benefit than a bored or preoccupied full-time mother who plonks the baby in front of the television for hours at a time. Other research indicates that stay-at-home mothers are more likely to be depressed and feel isolated. Depressed mothers interact far less with their babies, which is in itself a developmental downer. </p> <p>When this research is put into the wider context of what is happening within education, whether or not mothers are working must surely be secondary to what is happening within our schools. Educational standards are higher than ever for those children who manage to stay the course, and unprecedented numbers of young people now go on to some form of higher education. But, at the other end of the scale, rising numbers of disaffected children fail to see the point of getting an education at all when both of their parents are unemployed (presumably with their mother at home) and they live on run-down estates where the schools struggle to buy books and keep their charges in the classroom. </p> <p>From pre-conception onwards, parents are bombarded with research that centres on the welfare of their children and the way that parents can unwittingly damage them. At best, parents feel confused about the implications. Most, however, feel a great deal worse. They feel they are to blame for every minor mistake, for eating the wrong foods or living with too much stress while pregnant, guilty about opting for a caesarean rather than a natural birth, guilty about preferring reading the newspaper to engaging in vigorous interactive play with their toddler, and guilty about going back to work when most have little choice but to do so. </p> <p>Yet other research has shown that, despite our guilt (or perhaps because of it), parents today are spending more \"quality time\" with their children than ever before. Jonathan Gershuny - by coincidence, a sociologist also based at the University of Essex - found that even full-time employed women in 1995 devoted more time to childcare than non-employed mothers did in 1961. Meanwhile, as Ermisch is willing to concede, we still do not have a systematic overview of what constitutes good childcare: \"Society can do a great deal to make it easier for mothers to stay at home more when their children are small, but I'm less clear about what the individual can do. Psychologists don't have the answers either on the best types of childcare; the jury is still out on that.\" </p> <p>Clearly, we could do with more research.</p>",

Working mothers were rarer; high-quality daycare was almost nonexistent; and our knowledge of the psychological development of under-fives was scant. There were no early music classes, no dance or drama workshops, and few nursery schools with Montessori equipment encouraging the basic learning skills that we take for granted today. A great deal happens in children's lives between the ages of five and 18 that can affect their attitudes to education; without knowing their individual life stories, it is hard to tell surely whether they would have dropped out or failed A-levels anyway. It is obvious, but no less striking, that the children of educated working mothers stood a better chance of getting A-levels than those lower down the social scale. John Ermisch, co-author of the report with Marco Francesconi at the University of Essex, agrees that other factors inevitably influence educational outcomes: \"There are a lot of other things that you can't control, but I was a bit surprised by the size of the difference. My preconception was that what parents did with their time when they were not working would muddy the waters so much that the difference would be less.\" For every research paper that suggests working motherhood damages children, others indicate more positive effects on the social and cognitive development of children. At the Institute of Child Health, Ian Roberts con ducted a systematic review of childcare research and found that, on balance, it was good for children, provided they were in high-quality care. A trained nursery worker, able to stimulate and excite a child with a wide variety of educational toys for part of the day, is likely to be of far greater benefit than a bored or preoccupied full-time mother who plonks the baby in front of the television for hours at a time. Other research indicates that stay-at-home mothers are more likely to be depressed and feel isolated. Depressed mothers interact far less with their babies, which is in itself a developmental downer. When this research is put into the wider context of what is happening within education, whether or not mothers are working must surely be secondary to what is happening within our schools. Educational standards are higher than ever for those children who manage to stay the course, and unprecedented numbers of young people now go on to some form of higher education. But, at the other end of the scale, rising numbers of disaffected children fail to see the point of getting an education at all when both of their parents are unemployed (presumably with their mother at home) and they live on run-down estates where the schools struggle to buy books and keep their charges in the classroom. From pre-conception onwards, parents are bombarded with research that centres on the welfare of their children and the way that parents can unwittingly damage them. At best, parents feel confused about the implications. Most, however, feel a great deal worse. They feel they are to blame for every minor mistake, for eating the wrong foods or living with too much stress while pregnant, guilty about opting for a caesarean rather than a natural birth, guilty about preferring reading the newspaper to engaging in vigorous interactive play with their toddler, and guilty about going back to work when most have little choice but to do so. Yet other research has shown that, despite our guilt (or perhaps because of it), parents today are spending more \"quality time\" with their children than ever before. Jonathan Gershuny - by coincidence, a sociologist also based at the University of Essex - found that even full-time employed women in 1995 devoted more time to childcare than non-employed mothers did in 1961. Meanwhile, as Ermisch is willing to concede, we still do not have a systematic overview of what constitutes good childcare: \"Society can do a great deal to make it easier for mothers to stay at home more when their children are small, but I'm less clear about what the individual can do. Psychologists don't have the answers either on the best types of childcare; the jury is still out on that.\" Clearly, we could do with more research.",

      "body": "<p>Eton College has burst into the top 100 charities index, prompting fresh debate about the appropriateness of independent schools having charitable status. </p> <p>The exclusive Berkshire school is 72nd in the index run by Charity Finance magazine and Barclays bank. In the year to December 1999, it had income of \u00a328.2m, including \u00a323.4m from fees and grants. </p> <p>The development comes as the voluntary sector is deliberating on the case for modernising charity law, including the argument that all charities - whether registered with the charity commission or not - should have to prove public benefit as the main determinant of their status. </p> <p>Eton is an exempt charity, not registered with the commission. In a consultation paper, the charity law reform advisory group of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) proposes that all charities demonstrate public benefit in terms of issues such as access to facilities. An NCVO spokeswoman says: \"We do need a tighter definition of what is for public benefit, but we would not want to pre-judge the consultation exercise.\" </p> <p>Eton currently runs summer courses for pupils from state schools, including up to 50 from deprived Harlesden in north London, and offers what it calls \"social service\" activities in the local community. In 1995, a \u00a33m national lottery grant was controversially awarded to build a community athletics centre on college land. </p> <p>The top 100 charities index's highest new entrant, at 45, is Daughters of the Cross, a religious body involved in education, care and nursing. Most of its income, put at an average \u00a336.6m, comes from fees and charges to local authorities. </p> <p>Other new entrants are: the United Bible Societies Trust (56), Trustees for Roman Catholic Purposes (65), the Imperial War Museum (75), the Lowry Centre Trust (82), the Birmingham Hippodrome Theatre Trust (86) and the Prince's Trust (87). </p> <p>The index's top five charities remain unchanged, being - in order - the Wellcome Trust, the Nuffield Nursing Homes Trust, the National Trust, the Church Commissioners for England and the Salvation Army. </p> <p>The charity commission meanwhile has formally recognised conservation of the environment as a charitable purpose in its own right, issuing new guidance for charities in the field. Previously, the purpose had been recognised only informally. John Stoker, chief charity commissioner, says: \"This guidance brings clarity to the status of organisations set up to protect our built and natural environment, from castles to coastlines.\" </p> <p>The change is the latest product of the commission's review of the register of charities. Earlier moves extended the definition of charitable purpose to embrace urban and rural regeneration, relief of unemployment and promotion of community capacity building. </p> <p>The commission is now consulting on the extent to which museums and arts galleries can be charitable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eton College has burst into the top 100 charities index, prompting fresh debate about the appropriateness of independent schools having charitable status. The exclusive Berkshire school is 72nd in the index run by Charity Finance magazine and Barclays bank. In the year to December 1999, it had income of \u00a328.2m, including \u00a323.4m from fees and grants. The development comes as the voluntary sector is deliberating on the case for modernising charity law, including the argument that all charities - whether registered with the charity commission or not - should have to prove public benefit as the main determinant of their status. Eton is an exempt charity, not registered with the commission. In a consultation paper, the charity law reform advisory group of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) proposes that all charities demonstrate public benefit in terms of issues such as access to facilities. An NCVO spokeswoman says: \"We do need a tighter definition of what is for public benefit, but we would not want to pre-judge the consultation exercise.\" Eton currently runs summer courses for pupils from state schools, including up to 50 from deprived Harlesden in north London, and offers what it calls \"social service\" activities in the local community. In 1995, a \u00a33m national lottery grant was controversially awarded to build a community athletics centre on college land. The top 100 charities index's highest new entrant, at 45, is Daughters of the Cross, a religious body involved in education, care and nursing. Most of its income, put at an average \u00a336.6m, comes from fees and charges to local authorities. Other new entrants are: the United Bible Societies Trust (56), Trustees for Roman Catholic Purposes (65), the Imperial War Museum (75), the Lowry Centre Trust (82), the Birmingham Hippodrome Theatre Trust (86) and the Prince's Trust (87). The index's top five charities remain unchanged, being - in order - the Wellcome Trust, the Nuffield Nursing Homes Trust, the National Trust, the Church Commissioners for England and the Salvation Army. The charity commission meanwhile has formally recognised conservation of the environment as a charitable purpose in its own right, issuing new guidance for charities in the field. Previously, the purpose had been recognised only informally. John Stoker, chief charity commissioner, says: \"This guidance brings clarity to the status of organisations set up to protect our built and natural environment, from castles to coastlines.\" The change is the latest product of the commission's review of the register of charities. Earlier moves extended the definition of charitable purpose to embrace urban and rural regeneration, relief of unemployment and promotion of community capacity building. The commission is now consulting on the extent to which museums and arts galleries can be charitable.",

She has decided not to order another series just three episodes into an eight-part run. The series has been running for five years but has lost its sparkle since the death of actor Tony Doyle last year and the departure of Stephen Tompkinson and Dervla Kirwin two years ago. BBC1 schedulers attempted to give the show a boost by running the first episode on a Thursday night, immediately after the Phil Mitchell shooting in EastEnders. That drew 7.7m viewers, but the show has struggled since moving to its regular Sunday night slot against ITV blockbuster Heartbeat. Last Sunday Ballykissangel slumped to just 4.8m. In its heyday with original stars Kirwin and Tompkinson, who played Ballykissangel's landlady and priest respectively, the show pulled in audiences of well over 10m. \"Ballykissangel is coming to a natural end at the conclusion of this series,\" said a BBC spokesman. \"The drama has had a terrific run but it has been decided that Fitzgerald's Bar will close for the last time at the end of the current series.\" A new Australian priest, played by Robert Taylor, has been introduced to spice up the current series.

Sue Nicholls was last night relieved of her duties and transferred to Buckinghamshire health authority while an internal investigation takes place into the trust's defective waiting list management systems. The trust has been ordered by regional officials to explain how more than 37 breaches of the government's 18-month maximum waiting time guarantee were, over a long period, concealed from the Department of Health (DoH). Until a patient made a formal complaint in January, the trust had consistently claimed it had no patients waiting longer than 18 months, a claim reflected in the most up-to-date official DoH figures. The complaint triggered an independent review by the waiting list auditors, the National Patients Action Team, which was asked by NHS regional officials to produce a report into the affair. The report, published last week, revealed 37 people were waiting longer than 18 months for treatment and that more would be indentified in due course. The former chairwoman of the trust, Gillian Miscampbell - a Conservative county councillor - resigned, along with three non-executive board colleagues when the report was made public. It found that the trust suffered \"a fundamental failure of systems over a long period\", had a \"lack of knowledge and expertise in waiting list management\" and \"poor information systems\". It is not clear whether Ms Nicholls is to return to the trust. Last night it was announced an \"interim\" chief executive will join the trust on 1 April - Fiona Wise, currently chief executive of Enfield community care trust.

The balance of power now lies with Sky Digital - one of the reasons viewers were urged to buy into the rival OnDigital service was because the digital version of ITV and its sister station ITV2 were exclusively available on the terrestrial digital network. \"We are delighted to have concluded this agreement with SES. This is an important first step towards ITV broadcasting on satellite,\" said Kate Stross, ITV finance and development officer. UK viewers now have access to the BBC, BSkyB and ITV through SES digital satellite services. \"This is exciting news for the 4.7m Astra digital satellite homes in the UK. ITV's programming pedigree will further accelerate the demand for digital satellite in Britain,\" said Yves Elsen, commercial and marketing director of SES. SES is shortly expected to announce a deal with one of three US targets - Loral, GE Americom or PanAmSat - which will make it the largest satellite company in the world.

      "bodyText": "And about time too. That is the immediate reaction to today's announcement from ITV that it will broadcast its services on the Astra digital satellite - the system dominated by BSkyB - by the end of the year. Ever since Sky Digital launched in November 1998, it has seemed inevitable to objective observers - though perhaps not ITV's barons at Carlton and Granada - they would have to bite the bullet and swallow their pride. They must become \"platform\" neutral\", as the BBC puts it. Hard evidence has amassed of ITV viewing slumping in digital homes - and ITV2 languishing unseen - because neither service was instantly accessed via Sky's elecronic programme guide. The resulting pressure from advertisers has made joining commercially urgent. In January, the ITV network promised advertisers one of its key aims was to remain the most viewed channel in digital homes. This is difficult to achieve without joining Astra, since neither ONdigital (with 1m subscribers) nor cable approached Sky's critical mass (5.25m direct-to-home customers, 4.7m digital customers). But the decision also brings to the fore a little talked-about issue, which touches upon national interests and perhaps even security. Unless ONdigital, the terrestrial digital operator, stages an amazing leap forward, Britain's \"over the air\" TV transmission network will be effectively controlled offshore by a Luxembourg company. This is Societe Europeenne des Satellites, which is run from a rural chateau at Betzdorf. Using a growing family of Astra satellites, initially designed for telecommunications signals, SES has used its nationally allocated orbital slots for pioneering pan-European TV and data satellite transmission. This has directly aided Rupert Murdoch's global broadcasting thrust. It started out with analogue signals in the 1980s, allowing a then infant Sky to launch multi-channel television first in the UK in 1989 and outsmart and then crush British Satellite Broadcasting. Without this means of distribution, the rise of the Premier League and the growth of pay channels during the 1990s would have been far less assured. By 1998, the Astra system was upgraded to high-powered digital satellite transmission. This brought with it the means to offer hundreds of channels, near \"video-on demand\" staggered start times for films, and a revolutionary electronic programme guide that organises more than 250 channels by barcoded genre (entertainment, news, children, news, sport etc). Combined with a second return path via the telephone, this creates a system for home shopping, internet services and a rise in TV-driven spending and betting. The government is, of course, wedded to a policy of switching off analogue transmission. This will enable the vacated frequencies to be sold and exploited by commercial communications networks. Even though the first proposed deadline date for analogue switch-off, 2006, looks remote, by a strange twist of fate this policy thrust hands SES a major role in ensuring a national UK policy goal. And also maintains a secure broadcast system that provides news as well as entertainment. Also, ITV is an extremely complicated proposition - it requires tailor-made services because of its 16 regional feeds. This \"highlights the important role satellite can play in delivering local as well as pan-European services\", said SES commercial and marketing director Yves Elsen. Spare a final thought for ONdigital's plight. One of its selling points was the presence of ITV, including ITV2. By the end of the year that will be no more. Also, the deal with Astra paves the way for a total overhaul of ITV's planned digital services - children's and sports - further driving the satellite business. With a churn rate almost double that of BSkyB's and with talk of a flotation stalled, could ONdigital be allowed to succumb to BSkyB's bearlike embrace?

In a discussion that covered a broad range of subjects, Mr Smith also said he had problems with Anne Robinson's remarks about the Welsh and he \"reminded\" BBC bosses of their responsibility not to plunge into a ratings-driven war with ITV. On digital TV, he expressed surprising confidence that targets for starting to switch off the analogue network \"between 2006 and 2010\" could be met. Mr Smith announced his blueprint two years ago but fears have grown that take-up of digital TV will plateau. The government plans to phase in a digital-only system of TV distribution. However, it has guaranteed it will not turn off the existing service until virtually everyone in the country has digital access. \"The take-up of digital television has actually been happening at a far faster rate than originally expected,\" said Mr Smith. \"There are already 5m homes with satellite, 1m with terrestrial and fast approaching 1m with cable,\" he said. The culture secretary added, however, that broadcasters and manufacturers must do more to drive take-up. \"This is good progress but I, of course, recognise the next phase is going to be more difficult,\" he said. Mr Smith said he was working with broadcasters, retailers and manufacturers on a public information campaign to \"demystify digital\" and help speed this process along. \"We have also announced - through the DTI - that we are insisting on better and clearer labelling of digital equipment to ensure the public are not misled about what they are buying,\" he said.

Almost three-quarters of the total sample, and two-thirds of those given ECT most recently, said they were not given any information about possible side-effects. </p> <p>Margaret Pedler, head of policy development at Mind and author of the report, says that as well as memory loss, some people who had had ECT were left unable to concentrate, read, write or play musical instruments.

Instead, I just feel as if I'm being punished all the time.\" </p> <p>The survey does, however, show how some people have been helped by ECT.

Mr Marks reckons there is long term potential for some 300 American outlets. </p> <p>Many UK retailers - such as Body Shop, Sock Shop and Laura Ashley - have run into trouble after expanding into the US, but Mr Marks insists French Connection will avoid the pitfalls because it has been \"succeeding for some time\" and the roll-out will be slow. </p> <p>He added that the business was booming in the UK due to strong products, good design and good image. \"The whole package is linked to looking after our customers. They are more intelligent these days and more people should remember that.\" </p> <p>He said he was \"amazed\" by Marks &amp; Spencer's continued decline: \"They seem to go from bad to worse.\" </p> <p>French Connection is building a global brand, due in no small part to its controversial advertising. Earlier this month its \"Fcukinkybugger\" ads generated enormous publicity when they were banned from television due to their \"unacceptable level of innuendo\". </p> <p>Advertising watchdogs said they were \"shocked and surprised\" the company had \"the gall to send the script in\". But Mr Marks, whose 60% stake in the firm is worth nearly \u00a380m, is unabashed, and is plastering the nudge-nudge logo on a string of new products.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fashion chain French Connection yesterday bucked the trend and delivered some good news from the dishevelled retail clothing sector. While others wilt under the heat of tough price competition, French Connection announced profits up 20.7% to \u00a319.1m in the last 12 months and sales up 24% at \u00a3194m. The company, which has 122 British outlets and 25 in the US, is planning large scale gowth in Japan and the US - despite their present gloomy economic prospects. \"People are still going to wear clothes\", said chairman and chief executive Stephen Marks. The first Japanese store opened earlier this month, and two more will open shortly. Mr Marks reckons there is long term potential for some 300 American outlets. Many UK retailers - such as Body Shop, Sock Shop and Laura Ashley - have run into trouble after expanding into the US, but Mr Marks insists French Connection will avoid the pitfalls because it has been \"succeeding for some time\" and the roll-out will be slow. He added that the business was booming in the UK due to strong products, good design and good image. \"The whole package is linked to looking after our customers. They are more intelligent these days and more people should remember that.\" He said he was \"amazed\" by Marks &amp; Spencer's continued decline: \"They seem to go from bad to worse.\" French Connection is building a global brand, due in no small part to its controversial advertising. Earlier this month its \"Fcukinkybugger\" ads generated enormous publicity when they were banned from television due to their \"unacceptable level of innuendo\". Advertising watchdogs said they were \"shocked and surprised\" the company had \"the gall to send the script in\". But Mr Marks, whose 60% stake in the firm is worth nearly \u00a380m, is unabashed, and is plastering the nudge-nudge logo on a string of new products.",

Pop music trivia fans may soon be testing their knowledge over mobile phones, courtesy of Peter Powell. The former Radio 1 DJ's multimedia company Worldpop has started trials of pop music quiz games played over mobile phones. Two quiz games - a \"name that tune\" game and a music trivia game - are being piloted with a small sample of people from Worldpop's 4.5m-strong database. But the name of the company sponsoring the games is shrouded in secrecy. Worldpop, the first ever sponsor of the top 40 broadcast by the BBC, is also close to clinching a deal with a major high street retailer to offer location-based marketing services. The company has just signed to run a mobile phone text messaging service at the dance music festival Ericsson@homelands. The service, the first of its kind at a music festival, will allow registered audience members to receive exclusive news, special offers, travel information and last-minute updates, before, during and after the event. But event sponsors and advertisers will be offered the opportunity to use the services to send special offers and news to the 50,000 ravers attending the event. \"With the text-message trend spiraling within youth culture, Ericsson@homelands is the ideal situation for brands to target their audience directly,\" said Geoff Smith, joint managing director of Worldpop. The company is in talks with organisers of other music festivals about setting up a similar service. Worldpop last summer ran a text message service in Ibiza, offering thousands of clubbers free entry into clubs. It intends to run another Ibiza service this summer.",

This mountain area in the \u00d8sterdalen region close to the Swedish border is perfect wolf habitat, and the only place in Europe where the \"big four\" carnivores - wolf, bear, lynx and wolverine, a large and ferocious weasel - co-exist with their natural prey of moose, red deer, roe deer and reindeer. </p> <p>But it is also prime sheep farming land and, because they graze on uncultivated grassland in the summer, the sheep are easy pickings for wolves. Some 827 were killed by wolves last year in Norway, and half of these were in this one area. </p> <p>With Norway's rural policy crucial to its social and economic systems, the area's hundred farmers argue that the wolves must be killed because they threaten their highly-prized low-impact, sustainable agriculture techniques. \"If we fenced our sheep in the valleys as the Swedes do, we wouldn't have enough grass for winter. And, anyway, it doesn't necessarily stop wolf attacks,\" says Lise Baarstard, who runs a sheep farm in Koppang with her husband Bjorn. \"Our way is a better use of natural resources.\" </p> <p>Last year the Baarstards lost 35 of their animals to wolves. Another farmer lost 42 in one night. \"We're not against the wolf,\" Lise says, \"but if we want people to live in these districts, we have to control the predators.\" </p> <p>Government ecologists say that the cull will not affect the health of Scandinavia's wider wolf population. They say there is no danger of the genetic diversity being lost and argue that wolf numbers could rise in Sweden, where there is less danger to farmers. </p> <p>But environmental groups such as WWF, as well as the Swedish government, oppose the cull, saying that a critical minimum of 200 wolves is needed for the population to be genetically viable. </p> <p>Anyone killing a wolf in Norway is liable to six years' imprisonment. After hunting the animal almost to extinction, Norway signed a co-operation agreement with Sweden in 1998 to protect Scandinavia's endangered wolf. In 1997, its parliament set a first goal of eight to 10 family groups in southern Scandinavia (around 100 wolves), which it says has now been reached. </p> <p>Norway's environment minister, Siri Bjerke, says the growth to 200 must happen in the Swedish mountains, where sheep farming is enclosed and sheep are at less risk. \"I cannot win,\" she says. \"I have made a commitment to maintain a population of wolves, not the opposite, as environmentalists accuse me of. But because of the conflict with farming, it won't be possible for much more growth.\" </p> <p>She insists that there is scientific evidence that the cull would not jeopardise the wolf population. </p> <p>Three wolves have been shot so far - two from a helicopter, one from a snowmobile - since the cull started on February 10. Protesters criticise the farmers' inflexibility and say the government is running scared, protecting its rural Labour stronghold. \"The farmers are greedy and lazy,\" Christian says. \"They want to leave their sheep unsupervised in summer and just collect the compensation. Every other profession has to be flexible to the market and to working conditions. Why not them?\" </p> <p>Lise and Bjorn Baarstard insist that money is not the issue. Their medium-sized farm earns them only about \u00a38,000 a year (in one of the world's most expensive countries) and they get compensation at market rate, but this does not cover their costs. And it's not the point, anyway, says Lise. \"Our family have been here for 100 years. We want to farm, not get paid for dead sheep.\" </p> <p>And although critics say that many more sheep - 133,000 nationwide - die in the mountains every year from accidents or sickness, or are killed by wolverines, Lise insists that, in this area, the wolf is the biggest killer. </p> <p>Three protest camps have been established in the valleys. In one - a large camouflaged Swedish army tent - sleeping bags are put on reindeer skins on the ice floor and clothes hang above a stove. Keeping things dry in these temperatures is a matter of life and death. The tent is surrounded by haystacks, but not for shelter. They were put there by a farmer to stop any more tents being erected. Another hostile action involved a 5am attack by Koppang youths who poured anti-freeze on the protesters' sleeping bags and dragged them outside. Locals insist the boys were not connected to the farmers and were just drunk. </p> <p>Every day, the protesters - who go out in teams of 10 - and the hunters play cat and mouse.

Hunting here is not elitist or even a sport. It is a cultural tradition. The unwritten rules are: hunt only for food, not pleasure; only shoot if you are sure to kill and not maim; don't put yourself at an unfair advantage (hunting from snowmobiles or helicopters is actually illegal). The gov ernment hunters, say the protesters, are breaking every rule. </p> <p>\"Do they really think that, if they get rid of these nine wolves, more won't come over from Sweden?,\" says Christian. \"Of course, they'll come.\" </p> <p>After a 10-hour day out in minus 15C, the hunters are on the other side of the valley enjoying dinner in a warm rented house. The protesters, they admit, have been extremely effective. They don't expect to kill all nine wolves by their April 6 deadline, but they don't seem angry.

      "body": "<p>The red elephants of the Tsavo wildlife reserve in Kenya - red from the local clay dust - were virtually wiped out by poachers in a few decades. Grant Luscombe, director of the Landlife Trust, which opens its National Wildflower Centre (NWC) to the public on April 1, grew up in east Africa and loved the abundant wildlife, the endless savannah, the lakes as big as oceans and the coral coasts. </p> <p>He likens the destruction of the rhinos and elephants to a more insidious loss in the English countryside. \"There it was the Kalashnikovs and AK47s coming down from the troubles in the Horn of Africa which facilitated the ivory trade,\" he says. \"Here it was the boom sprayer and the combine harvester after the war that decimated our wildlife. But unlike in Africa, where they have since been proactive to reintroduce the herds, here nobody noticed it. All the hedgerows and the patchwork quilt of the countryside still looks intact. But when you get up close, there's nothing there.\" </p> <p>The scale of the problem is vast, says Luscombe, 48. Soils have been man-manipulated with the application of fertilisers and herbicides to the point where, according to English Nature, 95% of the 17m acres of lowland agricultural grassland in the UK has little or no ecological value. Wild flora has particularly suffered because water courses have been taken over by nettles. The early conservation movement inadvertently added to the problem by disturbing topsoils which had a massive weed seed bank of rough grasses, nettles, thistles and dock, triggering germination that swamped the wildflowers they were trying to reintroduce. </p> <p>From east Africa, Luscombe fetched up in the less exotic location of Liverpool, where he studied geology and then set up the somewhat incongruously titled Rural Preservation Association. \"I was sitting in a pub with two friends after graduating, thinking about what to do next,\" he recalls. \"We could have done three months on an oil rig analysing mud, but we didn't fancy that. I was interested in nature conservation, so we decided to set up a charity.\" </p> <p>As earth sciences graduates rather than botanists or naturalists, Luscombe and his co-founders approached wildlife conservation from a longer perspective. \"We took substrates as the starting point, because rock defines the soil which defines the vegetation,\" he explains. But perhaps more importantly, the charity had a strong community remit. \"We'd been involved in setting up a community association and housing co-op where we lived, and to run a nature conservation organisation in Liverpool we had to address the issues that people were concerned about, namely unemployment, debt and poverty.\" </p> <p>Luscombe took as a model the ecological landscaping started in Holland after the war. \"They were using native plants to create parks on quite a large scale,\" he says. \"Of course, the conditions were very different - sandy peaty soils and high water tables, and also different social conditions and attitudes - but we took away the best examples and applied them as best we could.\" </p> <p>From tiny derelict gap sites around Merseyside, Landlife now runs national woodland projects and has a working wildflower industry with cropping sites - mostly in Knowsley, the borough just outside Liverpool - which provides revenue for them and valuable rental income for farmers. </p> <p>\"It's about developing a creative conservation ethic,\" says Luscombe. \"The phrase has become common currency and, although it's a contradiction in terms in a way, it does describe what we do - making places where wildflowers can flourish, and very much putting the common species back as much as the localised rare ones.\" </p> <p>Wildflowers thrive in poor soils where there are light, water and nutrient stresses; as Luscombe points out, so-called derelict sites make perfect habitats. \"In the 1980s, we argued that sites which had nature conservation shouldn't be classed as derelict because they had a beneficial after-use. Now we're having to argue it all over again with brownfield sites.\" </p> <p>The NWC, a striking new building with a rooftop walk, is located close to Landlife's roots and its cropping sites in a rather neglected park in Knowsley. \"We were lucky enough to get a millennium grant to make it happen, but we are not reliant on visitor numbers as we have our own research and revenue projects,\" Luscombe says. \"It's very much a working centre, but with the opportunity to disseminate the message to community groups, schoolchildren and the public at large, and to hold conferences and encourage debate.\" </p> <p>But the real imperative for the centre, he says, is climate change. \"We need a twin-track approach. Local biodiversity action plans and habitat directives which came out of the Rio earth summit may not be sustainable if the forecasts on climate change are right. It's no good doing damp meadows in Devon if it's going to have the climate of the south of France by 2050. </p> <p>\"Creative conservation is not a substitute for existing habitats, and we need to make that distinction. We can't recreate ancient woodlands, and the impact of climate change is very much locked in now. But the wildflowers are a huge food source for many species that are on the decline in the countryside, and we have seen the reappearance of linnets, finches, skylarks, grey partridge, hares and insects. </p> <p>\"It's wonderful seeing the speed at which natural processes and the evolutionary dance kick in and how people respond to that.\" </p> <p>The National Wildflower Centre will be open from April 1 to September 30, Wednesdays to Sundays, 11am-5pm.

      "body": "<p>Whether home care work ever amounted just to a spot of dusting, and making a cup of tea for the elderly householder, is a moot point. But there is no doubt that the job has changed out of all recognition in recent years. And the strain is starting to tell. </p> <p>According to a new survey by Unison, the public services union, 73% of today's home care workers frequently help their clients with medication, 56% at least occasionally do dressings and as many as 83% have assisted with catheters. In 1995, in a previous survey, 43% said most or nearly all of their work was still domestic, as opposed to personal care. Today, that figure is only 5%. </p> <p>Just over half today's workers say they suffer back pain, commonly as a result of lifting clients, and eight in 10 think the role has become both more demanding and more stressful. Yet pay rates are typically less than \u00a35.50 an hour, even in the local authority sector, and can be little more than the \u00a33.70 statutory minimum. As Malcolm Wing, Unison's head of local government, says: \"Pay levels have fallen behind those in local catering, cleaning and retail jobs and equivalent jobs elsewhere in the public sector.

      "bodyText": "Whether home care work ever amounted just to a spot of dusting, and making a cup of tea for the elderly householder, is a moot point. But there is no doubt that the job has changed out of all recognition in recent years. And the strain is starting to tell. According to a new survey by Unison, the public services union, 73% of today's home care workers frequently help their clients with medication, 56% at least occasionally do dressings and as many as 83% have assisted with catheters. In 1995, in a previous survey, 43% said most or nearly all of their work was still domestic, as opposed to personal care. Today, that figure is only 5%. Just over half today's workers say they suffer back pain, commonly as a result of lifting clients, and eight in 10 think the role has become both more demanding and more stressful. Yet pay rates are typically less than \u00a35.50 an hour, even in the local authority sector, and can be little more than the \u00a33.70 statutory minimum. As Malcolm Wing, Unison's head of local government, says: \"Pay levels have fallen behind those in local catering, cleaning and retail jobs and equivalent jobs elsewhere in the public sector. So it is hardly surprising that staff are voting with their feet and going to work in less demanding jobs for better pay.\" This is not mere union propaganda.

As we emerge from the cold, dark days of winter, I have a deep desire to stride out in the fresh air, soak up the spring sunshine and get back to nature. Now, just as the buds are bursting and the birds are singing, the rural countryside has been placed out of bounds because of foot and mouth disease. </p> <p>Thank goodness for the urban countryside. The wild side of town cannot compare with windswept coastal cliff tops or wide open heath and moorland, but the downtown dawn chorus can out-sing farmland. And it is quite possible to walk for hours without the need to cross a road or stray outside wild green surroundings. While so much of the countryside has been industrialised, the green spaces in our towns and suburbs have become spectacularly successful as a post-industrial home for wildlife and for people. </p> <p>Domestic gardens are the principal resource: millions of sheltered, flowery glades beneath the canopy of the urban forest. Almost all our most familiar wildlife has its origins in woodland - blackbirds, wrens, robins, bluetits, foxgloves, hedgehogs and speckled wood butterflies are just a few of the species that have successfully made the move from wildwood glade to domestic garden. </p> <p>Indeed, so far as wildlife is concerned, our gardens must seem rather better than the original. When hibernating peacock butterflies and bumblebees emerge on unseasonably sunny March days, the rich supply of grape hyacinth nectar and crocus pollen can be a lifesaver. Ornamental fruits and berries feed the autumn birds and with the regular supply of sunflower seeds, peanuts and blocks of fat that millions of us offer, the urban forest is surely like paradise for birds. </p> <p>Our generosity is paying dividends. Ten years ago, just 17 different kinds of birds were known to feed at artificial feeders. By this winter the number had risen to more than 80. My inner-city neighbours regularly see bullfinches and goldcrests, green woodpeckers, nuthatches, goldfinches and tree creepers, as well as at least 30 other species of garden birds. My own small garden pond is a breeding site for frogs and toads, great crested newts and a variety of water beetles and dragonflies. Despite strong competition from the local cats, tawny owls and kestrels find the area a happy hunting ground. </p> <p>Very few of my more spectacular garden visitors live there. They just drop in from the surrounding landscape. A regular supply of food and water helps to turn my little \"forest glade\" into a wildlife super service-station - a focus for the creatures living just beyond the garden fence. </p> <p>Public parks and formal open spaces play a crucial role because they offer big trees and safe and easy public access. However, they tend to be sterile - good for daisies, dandelions and magpies, but sometimes little else. Luckily, there is also a huge amount of unofficial open space. In old industrial areas such as Merseyside, the Black Country, South Yorkshire and South Wales, post-industrial dereliction has evolved into a wonderfully wild landscape - unsprayed with chemicals, overgrown with brambles and hawthorn, and enriched with lupins, michaelmas daisies, raspberry canes and other \"exotic\" species. </p> <p>There are also neglected allotments, overgrown cemeteries, abandoned railway yards and other \"backlands\"- tangled wildlife habitat on a scale difficult to find beyond the city limits. </p> <p>It is the way the various elements of open space are linked together that makes the urban countryside so successful. A few remnants of the old rural boundary hedgerows interconnect with railway embankments, road verges and canals to create a continuous mosaic of varied green space. The railway land has the great advantage of being almost undisturbed by people - an ideal sanctuary for timid species - and the canals are perfect for bringing people and wildlife together, with level footpaths all along one edge and, on the far bank, inaccessible wetland habitat within sight and sound, but rarely within reach. </p> <p>Wildlife clearly benefits from the urban countryside, but so do all of us. The air is cleaner, thanks to trees in towns. The open spaces act as porous soak-aways in times of flood. Access to nature helps to relieve the stress of urban living - and the continuity of wildlife corridors provides real scope for a healthy bike ride to school or a walk to the shops. </p> <p>At local level, people fight passionately to protect the scruffiest patch of urban undergrowth, but on a larger scale the value of the urban countryside is overlooked - particularly in the brownfield/greenfield debate. The so-called brownfields are, in many cases, far from brown. They are the wild green play spaces of childhood, and a successful sanctuary for so much of our wildlife. </p> <p>Foot and mouth may have put farmland out of bounds, but we can still roam through wild green surroundings in our towns and cities. We hear much talk of urban sprawl and concreting the countryside.

      "body": "<p><strong> Helen Buchanan</strong>, head teacher of St Clement's primary school, serving some of the poorest estates in Salford, has mixed views about the effects of Labour's policies. She has seen at first hand that some benefit changes, perversely, have made it harder for lone parents who want to work. She has mixed views about her school being in an education action zone (EAZ) but is delighted at the plentiful funds available for repairing buildings. \"We're at the cutting edge of poverty here,\" says Buchanan. Keen to help local unemployment, she recruits parents as classroom assistants. But some say they are worse off working than claiming benefit. A lone mother, one of four assistants, found that her classroom job meant she moved off income support on to working families tax credit. With weekly dinner money totalling \u00a318.75 for three children, and with full rent and council tax to pay, the woman was unable to manage on her school earnings. She asked to be cut to 16 hours, so she would again be eligible for benefits. All the social problems of the estates are evident in the school. The counter-attack against deprivation begins at eight every morning with the breakfast club, one of six at Salford schools provided by Kellogg's, as an EAZ sponsor. It is one of the few aspects of the zones which Buchanan says has worked. But a budget of \u00a3750,000 split among 18 schools \"doesn't go anywhere\", she observes. \"The government was relying on the excitement of big business throwing money at education, but it never happened.\" Far better, she reckons, is the \"excellence in cities\" initiative. That has paid for a full-time learning mentor for four years. The role of the school is transformed by this way of providing pastoral care: the mentor \"can do home visits for reluctant attenders; [run] anger management courses; liaise with multi-agency workers\". And possibly best of all, the school having had to spend \u00a378,000 over eight years on repairs to redress vandalism, are the funds flowing in under Labour for repairs and refurbishment: \u00a325,000 for a security fence, \u00a3120,000 for central heating. \"We're even redecorating for the first time in 18 years,\" she says. </p> <p><strong> Dr Lawrence Addlestone</strong> says: \"I don't honestly see that anything any government has ever done has made any difference round here in the 12 years I've been a GP here.\" His five-partner practice has some 8,000 patients from the Langworthy area. He is sure that social problems have changed little, with the exception of never now seeing cases of malnourishment. Addlestone is critical of Labour for ending GP fundholding, which had been introduced by the Conservatives. \"We found it very empowering, and managed to do a lot more for our patients,\" he says. \"We've had to fight very hard to keep what we had. \"We had started a chiropractic service, but money for that is now limited. We had a cardiologist who would come once a week to see heart patients, but that's been withdrawn by Manchester Royal Infirmary. We had the services of a counsellor but now have to go through a central service, so instead of appointments for depressed patients within a few days, it now takes two or three months.\" As for shorter hospital waiting lists, he says: \"The impact has been on the statistics, not at the grassroots. Things have got slightly worse in some specialisms - orthopaedics, for instance - and some hospitals.\" The practice has access to three big hospitals, one of which often has a shorter waiting time than the others. Addlestone frequently finds himself sending off three referral letters at the same time for the same patient: the system just has to be played that way. He acknowledges that the new local primary care trust oversees the needs of an area covered by several practices and hospitals. \"I suppose it is more equitable,\" he says, \"but this government was supposed to bring everybody up to the highest standard - and all we've seen is that standards have gone down.\" </p> <p><strong> PC Paul Cusick</strong> says that, with the old-style beat bobby having been reinvented new-style by Greater Manchester Police, he needs to know as much about regeneration initiatives as crime initiatives on his patch of Salford. Crime in all its aspects on the estates is worrying, but fear of crime is even more potent, he says. And he is sympathetic to disaffected youth. \"We have to move gangs of young people; but we do understand there are very few youth clubs and cafes round here. Sometimes there are groups of 30 or 40. But in all honesty, half the time the kids are only gathering like that because they're frightened of another gang - though they wouldn't admit it.\" Cusick reckons that the new partnerships among professional groups are an excellent way of working, \"rather than keeping it in our own backyard\". He adds: \"Before, everything was bunged on the police, and it got to the point where we were doing everything.\" Early days yet, though, for spectacular results. \"To look at the area, there's not been a vast improvement, I'm afraid.

      "bodyText": "Helen Buchanan, head teacher of St Clement's primary school, serving some of the poorest estates in Salford, has mixed views about the effects of Labour's policies. She has seen at first hand that some benefit changes, perversely, have made it harder for lone parents who want to work. She has mixed views about her school being in an education action zone (EAZ) but is delighted at the plentiful funds available for repairing buildings. \"We're at the cutting edge of poverty here,\" says Buchanan. Keen to help local unemployment, she recruits parents as classroom assistants. But some say they are worse off working than claiming benefit. A lone mother, one of four assistants, found that her classroom job meant she moved off income support on to working families tax credit. With weekly dinner money totalling \u00a318.75 for three children, and with full rent and council tax to pay, the woman was unable to manage on her school earnings. She asked to be cut to 16 hours, so she would again be eligible for benefits. All the social problems of the estates are evident in the school. The counter-attack against deprivation begins at eight every morning with the breakfast club, one of six at Salford schools provided by Kellogg's, as an EAZ sponsor. It is one of the few aspects of the zones which Buchanan says has worked. But a budget of \u00a3750,000 split among 18 schools \"doesn't go anywhere\", she observes. \"The government was relying on the excitement of big business throwing money at education, but it never happened.\" Far better, she reckons, is the \"excellence in cities\" initiative. That has paid for a full-time learning mentor for four years. The role of the school is transformed by this way of providing pastoral care: the mentor \"can do home visits for reluctant attenders; [run] anger management courses; liaise with multi-agency workers\". And possibly best of all, the school having had to spend \u00a378,000 over eight years on repairs to redress vandalism, are the funds flowing in under Labour for repairs and refurbishment: \u00a325,000 for a security fence, \u00a3120,000 for central heating. \"We're even redecorating for the first time in 18 years,\" she says. Dr Lawrence Addlestone says: \"I don't honestly see that anything any government has ever done has made any difference round here in the 12 years I've been a GP here.\" His five-partner practice has some 8,000 patients from the Langworthy area. He is sure that social problems have changed little, with the exception of never now seeing cases of malnourishment. Addlestone is critical of Labour for ending GP fundholding, which had been introduced by the Conservatives. \"We found it very empowering, and managed to do a lot more for our patients,\" he says. \"We've had to fight very hard to keep what we had. \"We had started a chiropractic service, but money for that is now limited. We had a cardiologist who would come once a week to see heart patients, but that's been withdrawn by Manchester Royal Infirmary. We had the services of a counsellor but now have to go through a central service, so instead of appointments for depressed patients within a few days, it now takes two or three months.\" As for shorter hospital waiting lists, he says: \"The impact has been on the statistics, not at the grassroots. Things have got slightly worse in some specialisms - orthopaedics, for instance - and some hospitals.\" The practice has access to three big hospitals, one of which often has a shorter waiting time than the others. Addlestone frequently finds himself sending off three referral letters at the same time for the same patient: the system just has to be played that way. He acknowledges that the new local primary care trust oversees the needs of an area covered by several practices and hospitals. \"I suppose it is more equitable,\" he says, \"but this government was supposed to bring everybody up to the highest standard - and all we've seen is that standards have gone down.\" PC Paul Cusick says that, with the old-style beat bobby having been reinvented new-style by Greater Manchester Police, he needs to know as much about regeneration initiatives as crime initiatives on his patch of Salford. Crime in all its aspects on the estates is worrying, but fear of crime is even more potent, he says. And he is sympathetic to disaffected youth. \"We have to move gangs of young people; but we do understand there are very few youth clubs and cafes round here. Sometimes there are groups of 30 or 40. But in all honesty, half the time the kids are only gathering like that because they're frightened of another gang - though they wouldn't admit it.\" Cusick reckons that the new partnerships among professional groups are an excellent way of working, \"rather than keeping it in our own backyard\". He adds: \"Before, everything was bunged on the police, and it got to the point where we were doing everything.\" Early days yet, though, for spectacular results. \"To look at the area, there's not been a vast improvement, I'm afraid. For the initiatives that have been brought in recently, we haven't got the cash yet. But we're hoping to get millions and millions from New Deal.\" That could mean new landscapes, new lives. And Cusick is optimistic - even though in his part of Salford, where sector policing has been introduced, his team of eight beat officers is two under strength. Rita McNamara , education officer for the Salford youth offending team, is a fan of the home secretary - certainly as far as the Crime and Disorder Act is concerned.

She is 88, a retired Margate patisserie worker, and the reason 30 Dusseldorf schoolteachers are taking photographs of her front door is that she lives at St John's Hospital Almshouses - built in 1084 to provide housing for the elderly, and still fulfilling that function some nine centuries later. </p> <p>Like all the other 33 residents at St John's, Elsie has her own key to her own flat, looking out over a courtyard that is altogether more Oxbridge than OAP. From one window, she can see the spires of Canterbury cathedral; from the other, the lopsided Tudor gatehouse - through which she pops to the shops - and the Norman refectory and 11th-century privy. </p> <p>She appreciates the photogenic surroundings, but what she really likes about living at St John's is that it allows her to retain her independence, while at the same time feel part of a community. \"I've got my own place, my own things - and plenty of company if I want it\", she says. \"The great thing is, though, there's no one telling me what to do.\" </p> <p>Such enthusiasm is increasingly echoed elsewhere. Almshouses are far from a thing of the past: the number of places they offer is rising by 5-10% a year. \"The majority of almshouse charities in this country are in a state of expansion or refurbishment,\" says Anthony Leask, assistant director of the Almshouse Association. \"We expect to see that increase continuing, given that the number of pensioners will go up by 50% over the next 30 years.\" </p> <p>The word \"independence\" keeps coming up among residents. Elsie Avery and seven fellow residents are at the weekly coffee morning not because they have been herded into the common room, but because they have chosen to come. They're not big on organised activities here. </p> <p>\"We made a conscious decision not to put a television in the common room,\" says St John's bursar, Richard Akister, a former bank manager. \"People have TV sets in their own flat. We are very much not a nursing home, and very much not the kind of place where people are wheeled in front of the box and left there all day.\" </p> <p>The kind of place it is, though, is a peculiar mixture of modern commercial concern and medieval charity. St John's brings in \u00a350,000 a year from renting out the dozen shops that line the almshouse frontage, in the city's busy Northgate. It also gets interest on money that has been invested for five centuries; it even gets \u00a313.33 annually from Henry II, who granted it 25 groats a year in perpetuity as a kind of royal community service following his part in the Thomas \u00e0 Becket murder in 1170. </p> <p>The upshot of all this is that, like the other 1,750 almshouses in Britain, St John's offers residents private sheltered accommodation at a distinctly subsidised rate. The weekly rent of \u00a346.50 (\u00a372.50 for the more modern flats) is less than half of what people would pay on the open market. And if they were to try to buy a leasehold flat in a sheltered scheme, it would cost \u00a350,000-\u00a390,000 plus up to \u00a35,000 a year in service charges. </p> <p>For their rent, the residents of St John's get to live in an environment which is not only safe, friendly and picture-postcard pretty, but also has a care manager (to help liaise with health and social services departments) and a gate leading straight into Sainsbury's. In fact, the St John's trustees helped fund a new \u00a31m residential wing by selling some of the back garden to the supermarket. </p> <p>There are three main qualifications for residence: you must be over 65, have some link with Canterbury (work or family) and be unable to afford proper housing. A church connection can come in handy. Resident Anne Green, 89, was the warden of a clergy house throughout her working life, while Pat and Joyce Barry, both 85 and the scheme's only married couple, ran a diocesan retreat. </p> <p>Indeed, there is a well-attended medieval chapel at St John's - as at its fellow almshouse, St Nicholas, in nearby Harbledown, which was set up in the 12th century as a hilltop community for lepers. Its church was built with a sloping floor to aid sluicing and disinfecting following a service. </p> <p>In 1276, there were as many as 100 lepers living at St Nicholas, known then as the Hospital of the Wood of Blean. But as leprosy began to die out towards the end of the 14th cen tury, the community admitted those whose afflictions were limited to old age and poverty. Today, St Nicholas has just 14 residents, who look out over rolling Kent countryside. The ancient church bell summons them the 50 yards to services. \"You don't have to be a Christian to live at either St John's or St Nicholas,\" says Akister. \"But you do need to feel comfortable in a group of people who are.\" </p> <p>You don't need to be female, either, but women outnumber men by three to one - a figure mirrored throughout the estimated 40,000 almshouse population in the UK. </p> <p>One notable exception is Sutton's Hospital (with the medieval connotation of hospitality rather than illness), in London's Charterhouse Square. All 40 of its residents - or \"brothers\", as they are called - are men, aged between 60 and 96. They pay \u00a3130 a week for their own Tudor bedsit, meals and laundry included. </p> <p>The almshouse is less than 100 yards from the plush Barbican estate and Smithfield meat market, but it is set in beautiful, cloistered surroundings. It is funded by the bequest of Elizabethan industrialist Thomas Sutton, who made a fortune from coal mining and money lending. Before his death in 1611, he arranged that all his worldly wealth should be used to set up a school for bright young boys (Charterhouse, now in Godalming, Surrey) and an almshouse for needy old gentlemen. Among the first to take up residence was George Fenner, one of Francis Drake's sea captains. </p> <p>Such was the extent of Sutton's wealth that, for four centuries, the trustees have been able to run the almshouse on the interest earned. Likewise, St John's in Canterbury has made good use of the lands and property it was given by its founder, Archbishop Lanfranc, in the 11th century. It also did well in the 20th century, when it sold off 75 acres for the University of Kent to be built on. </p> <p>Because of their private incomes, many almshouses do not qualify for public sector money unless they can show they are doing work for which the state might otherwise pay. An example was when Trinity Hospital almshouse, in Salisbury, built a new development for frailer residents (designated \"very sheltered\" accommodation) and got half the \u00a31.1m cost from the district council and the housing corporation. </p> <p>The guiding principle at Trinity is that residents should remain under the charity's umbrella until they die. The same applies at Sutton's Hospital, where 24-hour nursing care is provided for those brothers who can no longer look after themselves. At St John's, however, as at many other almshouses, there is no such option. </p> <p> \"We have just built a new wing to house those residents who are finding their old flats hard to cope with,\" says bursar Akister. \"The older properties are so narrow it's impossible to get a Zimmer frame round the corner, and extremely difficult to fit two people into the bathroom at the same time - which makes it hard for care assistants to give residents a bath. </p> <p>\"But we make it clear to everyone who comes here that we are not a hospital or a nursing home, and that when they can no longer look after themselves they will have to leave.\" </p> <p>Opinion at the coffee morning is that totally care-dependent residents would compromise the principle of independent living. \"This is a lovely place, just as it is\", says one woman. \"We all just hope we'll go before we have to leave - if you see what I mean.\" </p> <p><strong>Age-old help</strong></p> <p> The first recorded almshouse was set up in 937, by King Athelstan, at York. Today, 1,750 almshouse charities operate in the UK, some with just three cottages, others with as many as 1,000 properties. Altogether, they provide about 30,000 homes, mostly flats or one-storey houses. </p> <p>While many of the early ones were set up by the Church, after the 16th century city livery companies, mayors and landowners stepped in.

      "body": "<p>Cardiff is home to one of the oldest multi-racial communities in Britain. As the coal metropolis of the world for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Welsh capital attracted a kaleidoscope of immigrants to work aboard ships and to build and service its docks. In the 1950s, some 57 nationalities were counted among the 10,000 people living in Butetown, the mile-long stretch of dockland at the southern end of the city, commonly known as Tiger Bay. </p> <p>American academic Glenn Jordan has been striving to track the area's 150-year history since he arrived on these shores 17 years ago. Instead of finishing a PhD, he set about creating an archive of local people's memories, documents and photographs. What started as a weekly oral history class in a community centre is now the Butetown History and Arts Centre (BHAC), which features in a new Joseph Rowntree Foundation report, Creative Regeneration. </p> <p>\"I deliberately chose to stay and build up an archive,\" Jordan says. \"I had this bizarre experience of looking through historical records and the images I wanted were just not there. There was almost nothing of women at work, for example. Just a few Irish women loading potatoes. Yet there were thousands of women who worked on the docks.\" </p> <p>Jordan, an African-American whose father was descended from a slave owner and whose mother was part-Cherokee, was drawn by Butetown's mixed ethnic heritage. What makes it unique, he says, is its level of intermarriage between male immigrants and Welsh women. \"The social history of Butetown provides us with valuable lessons about how to live with others - with people of different skin colours, beliefs and ways of life - in an atmosphere of tolerance, respect and harmony.\" </p> <p>Yet the popular image of Tiger Bay is as an immoral, lascivious hotbed of prostitution, gambling and violence. Rita Delpeche, a 69-year-old member of BHAC who is of Barbadian and Jewish origin, recalls: \"There was so much love here in the old days. But outside Butetown, all the women were portrayed as prostitutes and the men as pimps.\" </p> <p>Jordan was concerned to give local people the opportunity to represent their own history. He describes BHAC as an exercise in cultural democracy: \"I wanted to empower people to control their own history, and that's about building up an historical archive that wouldn't otherwise be there. I also believe it is morally right to preserve the history of ordinary working-class people, many of them immigrants, who suffered and died helping to make Cardiff a great city. Future generations should be able to learn about their experiences - not just about the history of coal merchants and the lords of Bute.\" </p> <p>The BHAC now boasts more than 450 hours of oral histories and 3,000 photographs, plus videos and docu ments. Letters, diaries, birth certificates, boarding house ledgers and passports have all been donated by Bay residents, or their relatives, as the community dies out. \"It's not difficult to collect the material,\" says Jordan. \"The hard part is properly cataloguing, storing and analysing it.\" </p> <p>The material has been used to mount a number of exhibitions, produce a series of books, present slide shows at community venues and create a newsletter and resource pack distributed to 700 schools. The Rowntree report praises the project as \"a vehicle for the community's struggle to maintain a pride in its past, in the face of urban decline, poverty, unemployment and social deprivation\". </p> <p>It was also impressed that volunteers gained experience in archive work, from cataloguing materials to training in oral archive transcription, and had received IT training to edit and design the newsletter. And it flagged up the centre's work with homeless young people on photographic projects exploring visions of identity. </p> <p>At 48, Jordan - a large, ebullient man - has lost none of the passion and quest for social justice and equality that fuelled his involvement in high-school politics in California in the late 1960s. \"We fought to get black teachers, to stop white teachers calling us negroes or coloured, to introduce black history courses and Afro-American literature,\" he says. \"We won every demand, with great difficulty. It was amazing.\" </p> <p>Surrounded by family and friends denied the opportunity to fulfil their potential - his father was a talented carpenter, barred from the trade on grounds of race - Jordan was one of the first generation of black students to enter California's Stanford University, where he studied psychology and the then new course of African and Afro-American studies. </p> <p>At the same time as his own horizons were expanding, across the Atlantic the close-knit Tiger Bay community was being ripped apart by a slum clearance programme. Many of the area's oldest families were moved out, and their only link now is through the history project. </p> <p> The birth of BHAC coincided with another transformation: in the mid-1980s, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was set up to oversee the \u00a31.66bn regeneration of the docks. Jordan was confident his centre would play a part in plans to put the city on the global tourist map. </p> <p>\"I thought they'd be able to see what any fool could see - that any successful redevelopment would have to deal seriously with local cultural heritage,\" he says. \"We proposed the establishment of a people's museum and arts centre, run by ourselves in a building supplied by the corporation. It would provide an essential heritage attraction in a redevelopment which had paid little attention to the multi-cultural history of the area.\" </p> <p>But BHAC is still located in the small gallery space it moved into in 1996 with European funding. Jordan describes as \"small-minded\" the lack of support from the corporation, which has favoured waterfront developments of luxury warehouse apartments, restaurants and office blocks. \"Look at the names of the new streets,\" he says. \"Whoever named them hasn't a clue of the history. Mermaid Quay - it could be in New Zealand.\" </p> <p>That lack of support means that BHAC has had to rely on funding from the national lottery charities board and the Home Office, which last November stumped up \u00a3280,000 under its \"connecting communities\" programme. This will enable the centre to employ a full-time gallery manager and to welcome back Jordan as director - a post he relinquished in 1995 in favour of a board position as president, allowing him to concentrate on his job as a senior lecturer in cultural studies and photography at the University of Glamorgan. \"I hoped local people would run the centre themselves,\" he says. \"But most of the people have only loose connections to the place now and aren't prepared to put in the hours and do the laborious tasks of transcribing tapes.\" </p> <p>Despite this, Jordan has no plans to head home. He will continue to seek sanctuary from the \"racism, conservatism, and injustice\" of the US in the multi-racial harmony of Butetown's past. </p> <p>Creative Regeneration: Lessons from 10 Community Arts Projects is published at \u00a312.95 by Joseph Rowntree Foundation (tel: 01904-629241).</p>",

It would provide an essential heritage attraction in a redevelopment which had paid little attention to the multi-cultural history of the area.\" But BHAC is still located in the small gallery space it moved into in 1996 with European funding. Jordan describes as \"small-minded\" the lack of support from the corporation, which has favoured waterfront developments of luxury warehouse apartments, restaurants and office blocks. \"Look at the names of the new streets,\" he says. \"Whoever named them hasn't a clue of the history. Mermaid Quay - it could be in New Zealand.\" That lack of support means that BHAC has had to rely on funding from the national lottery charities board and the Home Office, which last November stumped up \u00a3280,000 under its \"connecting communities\" programme. This will enable the centre to employ a full-time gallery manager and to welcome back Jordan as director - a post he relinquished in 1995 in favour of a board position as president, allowing him to concentrate on his job as a senior lecturer in cultural studies and photography at the University of Glamorgan. \"I hoped local people would run the centre themselves,\" he says. \"But most of the people have only loose connections to the place now and aren't prepared to put in the hours and do the laborious tasks of transcribing tapes.\" Despite this, Jordan has no plans to head home. He will continue to seek sanctuary from the \"racism, conservatism, and injustice\" of the US in the multi-racial harmony of Butetown's past.

      "body": "<p>Achild is crying somewhere upstairs in the three-bedroom terrace house in Edgbaston, Birmingham. His cries rise above the sound of other children's voices in the home. An adult calls out in Punjabi and his wailing is soon hushed, for there are enough hands to pick him up and see to his needs. </p> <p>The child, 18 months old, is the youngest nephew of Ahmed Mohammed, head of this Pakistani household. The home is cosily warm, basically furnished and very busy, with doors slamming, footsteps running up and down stairs and heads peering around the living room door to see who has come to visit. The dwelling is home to four adults and 10 children, all related. No one complains about overcrowding. It's all about supporting each other and, when it comes to marriage, they keep it in the family. </p> <p>Mohammed's wife, Shaheen, is his first cousin - his mother's sister's eldest daughter. Their parents agreed the union from the day the children were born. They were married in Pakistan in 1972. Several years later, when Mohammed's younger brother, Shezad, who lives with him, reached 18, he was packed off to the old country to meet his betrothed, Sevina, who is Shaheen's sister. </p> <p>Cousin Freed Raja is the son of another aunt on the Mohammed brothers' maternal side. In 1971, at the age of 14, he was married to his 13-year-old cousin in Pakistan. She is the daughter of another maternal aunt. </p> <p>This practice of wedding close relatives - known as consanguineous marriages - is common among Muslims all over the world, and particularly so in Britain. In Birmingham, almost 80% of arranged marriages in the 70,000-strong community are cousin-to-cousin or uncle-to-niece. </p> <p>\"I can name you at least 40 couples off the top of my head who are all in first-cousin marriages,\" says Raja, who is a community liaison officer for Birmingham city council. \"It is such an important part of our culture. It has been practised since at least the 14th century. We do it because we believe it is important to keep a tight-knit, supportive family - especially here in Britain, where we need to keep our roots strong.\" </p> <p>But the legacy of consanguineous marriages is taking its toll. There is a high rate of infant death among Pakistani families and even higher rates of chronic disease. </p> <p>Among the families of the Mohammed brothers, Raja and another related couple alone, there have been eight miscarriages. Of a total 19 children, nine suffer from some form of disability, ranging from serious, life-threatening diseases to hearing impairment. </p> <p>Shezad and Sevina have three children, two of whom are disabled. The first suffers from a musculo-skeletal problem: her neck shakes continuously and she has difficulty holding up her head. The second, a seven-year-old boy, has a learning disability and disorder of the central nervous system. He has to be carried and is incapable of any form of communication. Only those closest to him understand his needs. The couple's youngest child, the 18-month-old boy, so far appears healthy. </p> <p>Ahmed's children are relatively lucky. Only one of his seven, a 13-year-old girl, has medical problems. Her skeletal deformities have required three operations to try to correct her twisted frame, which forces her feet inwards. </p> <p>Of Raja's seven children, one has a lazy eye and two others have weak eyesight. Two of these three also have hearing problems and a fourth child had a double row of top teeth. </p> <p>Gene pooling has cost another cousin several miscarriages. After 12 years of trying, she now has two children - but both are troubled. The elder boy of 17 has restricted growth and the daughter suffers the blood disorder, thalassemia. </p> <p>Their problems are far from unusual, says Mamoona Tahir, a specialist registrar in public health for Birmingham health authority. She has collated research carried out over the past five years on perinatal mortality and infant morbidity. The studies reveal that infant mortality rates in the Pakistani community are 2.5 to three times higher than for any other group in Birmingham. </p> <p>Tahir says: \"There's nothing wrong in marrying first cousins; as such, it doesn't give rise to anything. But if you're carrying a gene that you've inherited from an ancestor, and your partner comes from the same family and he has the same gene too, when you have children the genes find a pair and this allows certain groups of conditions, such as auto-recessive illnesses, to manifest metabolic conditions, such as phenylketonuria, galactosemia and cystinosis. </p> <p>\"These illnesses require long-term care. It shortens the life span of the children, who are often severely disabled. With multiple problems, some will need transplants and most are mentally subnormal. For the families, it means years of suffering.\" </p> <p>Overall, West Midlands has the highest perinatal mortality rate in England and Wales. On average, about 200 babies are stillborn or die within the first week of life each year in Birmingham - one of the highest rates in the country. And congenital abnormalities within the Pakistani community are responsible for about 40% of these deaths. </p> <p>Another alarming statistic is that Pakistani babies are 10 times more likely to suffer an inherited metabolic disorder than are other babies born in West Midlands. And Muslim children under one year old are almost twice as likely to stay in hospital because of congenital malformations than other Birmingham babies. </p> <p>These studies lay the blame for the disturbing figures firmly on the community's tradition of marrying relations. Research suggests that the number of congenital abnormalities in Birmingham's Pakistani community would fall 60% if the practice did not occur. </p> <p>Now, for the first time , Birmingham health authority is challenging the centuries-old custom. For years it has put the problems down to socio-economic conditions. Poverty, poor housing, illiteracy and unemployment disproportionately affect the community. </p> <p>But figures show that inter-relation marriages have a greater impact on the health of the children than do any of these factors. So this time, the health authority's warning to the Pakistani community is that if they continue to marry first cousins, they risk the health of generations of children to come. </p> <p>\"This is so culturally sensitive that even though Birmingham health authority knew that high perinatal death rates and congenital abnormalities were linked to close cousin marriages many years ago, it didn't dare approach the subject for fear of being accused of racism,\" says Karamjeet Ballagan, who is coordinating the health authority's campaign to raise awareness in the Pakistani community. \"But, at last, it's been recognised that something urgently must be done to bring the numbers down.\" </p> <p>The authority has recently launched a pilot project working in partnership with the community. It involves a series of separate conferences for Muslim women and men, and the production of leaflets in Punjabi and Urdu, tackling the issue sympathetically. Sex is a taboo subject in the Muslim community and there is no terminology for body parts (they are seen as swear words), so health workers have consulted community leaders to help them find suitable phrases that will not offend. </p> <p>On top of this, there is a media campaign targeting Asian TV, radio stations and newspapers, and a roadshow going into schools. \"We are also developing strategies for training Muslim volunteer workers so they can give advice and explain the problems,\" says Ballagan. \"The community has a high rate of illiteracy and we need to find a range of ways to reach people. It's taken us nearly a year to get the project up and running.\" </p> <p>A year ago, when questions were tentatively raised about inbreeding and its links to the health of the community, religious leaders reacted angrily to the implication. They argued that the allegation would undermine their society. </p> <p>But attitudes have gradually softened and changed. \"This custom is not based on religious practices,\" explains Qari Tassawar ul Haq, general secretary of Birmingham's Pakistan Forum. \"It doesn't say in the Koran that you should or should not marry your first cousin. Even though the Prophet Mohammed married his third cousin, we must not confuse cultural habits with religious doctrine. </p> <p>\"But we can see that our custom is affecting our babies. We want healthy babies, so we are prepared to listen to what the health authority has to say, especially as it is showing us the evidence. However, our biggest problem is convincing our elders. They are the ones - the heads of the households - who make the decisions about arranged marriages. </p> <p>\"For years, our people have accepted the deaths and illnesses as fate, the work of Allah. Now we have to get them to see it first and foremost as a health issue. It's going to be extremely hard to stop first-cousin marriages. I believe it will take decades to change our system.\" </p> <p> Tahir says: \"We're advising people to consider marrying a distant cousin. Our studies show that a related couple with no family history of any problems has a three-in-100 chance of their child being affected. So the risks aren't that high. But if they've had disability in the family, there's a 30% risk of giving birth to a child with metabolic disorders. </p> <p>\"At the moment, Pakistani women don't use the health services as much as they should. We want them to begin to lobby for services and approach their GPs and genetic clinics for counselling before they have children - and, where they are pregnant, to go for regular antenatal visits so they can make informed decisions.\" </p> <p>As head of his household, Raja has already broken with tradition and made the decision not to marry his 22-year-old son to a first cousin. \"I've lost the support of some family members,\" he admits. \"They accuse me of bringing shame on our family because I chose not to take the risk. But I'd rather lose a cousin than marry my son to my sister's daughter and end up with a child that will suffer for the rest of its life.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Our love affair with the car may be verging on the obsessive and threatening disastrous environmental and economic consequences. But a conference today will hear how we can renegotiate our relationship with the internal combustion engine and bring about a new car culture. </p> <p>The solution, it will be argued, is to share vehicle ownership. \"Car share clubs are an innovative alternative to owning a car, freeing the individual to choose the best transport option for their trip,\" says Antonio Roberts, of the Community Car Share Network (CCSN), which is hosting today's conference in Luton. \"Ultimately, car clubs can reduce congestion and pollution and, with car club vehicles on average replacing five privately owned cars, the pressure on parking spaces is eased.\" </p> <p>The network takes its cue from the experiences of European countries, where more than 100,000 people are members of some 100 clubs and use car sharing as an everyday part of their transport mix. \"Over a decade of car share clubs has shown that, on average, members reduce their car mileage by half and replace this with a combination of public transport, cycling and walking,\" says Roberts. </p> <p>The way a car share club works is that a member books a car by telephoning a call centre, then picks up the vehicle - usually parked within a 10-minute walk of the caller's house, with the keys kept in a nearby safe. The member notes the mileage in a log book at the beginning and end of every journey. Members pay a one-off \u00a325 joining fee plus a returnable \u00a3100 insurance deposit, and there is a \u00a310-a-month fee on top. Generally, members are charged \u00a33 for the first hour of car use, \u00a32 for each subsequent hour, and around 15p a mile. </p> <p>These charges compare favourably with the experience of those in existing European schemes. People who clock up around 6,000 miles a year - that's about 45% of UK motorists - could save up to \u00a31,500 on their annual motoring costs. </p> <p>Today's conference marks a coming of age for car sharing clubs in Britain. Since CCSN was launched in 1999, its organisers have opted for a low-profile approach that has fostered the launch of 11 car clubs with total membership of just under 1,000. </p> <p>\"We didn't want to raise expecta tions and not be in a position to deliver a service,\" says Roberts. \"As it takes time to reduce dependency on the car, it was vital that we were in a position to offer a service that was convenient, reliable and affordable.\" </p> <p>Roberts admits that the environmental benefits of car share clubs are not a big factor when people come to decide about giving up their own vehicle. \"Personal benefit is the primary motivating factor,\" he says. </p> <p>Chas Ball, co-director of the car club service provider Smart Moves, believes that, for their long-term success, car clubs need not only careful nurturing but also the right set of conditions. \"Currently, a number of factors are working against car clubs. For instance, the plummeting price of second-hand cars isn't helping, nor is the public perception of public transport, which, since the recent train crashes, has nose-dived.\" </p> <p>However, Ball takes heart from what he sees as pro-active support from a growing number of local authorities. And while community-based car share clubs are taking their first tentative steps, employer-led schemes are enjoying something of a boom. \"The response has been phenomenal in recent years,\" says Katherine Mitchell, of the Association for Commuter Transport (ACT). </p> <p>Launched in 1997 with the aim of \"promoting sustainable transport and reduced car dependency through the adoption of commuter travel planning\", ACT now has more than 120 members, the majority of whom are blue-chip corporates ranging from Marks &amp; Spencer and Boots to drugs manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca. </p> <p>\"So many people now drive to work by themselves that company car parks soon get full up,\" Mitchell says. \"If the company wants to expand, it often has no more available parking space.\" Company car share schemes usually involve lift-sharing, he says. \"By offering these schemes, they can get more employees into their sites.\" </p> <p>One of the biggest employer-led schemes is the Royal Bank of Scotland's, with more than half the 3,000 employees at its South Gyle business park operation, outside Edinburgh, now signed up to share lifts. </p> <p>\"Business parks have always faced bigger transport problems than the inner-city because of a lack of proper transport infrastructure,\" says David Graham, the bank's environment manager. \"People just became exasperated by the gridlocked conditions that occur here everyday.\" </p> <p>Graham estimates that the scheme has led to a reduction of 650 cars a day entering the business park. Its success, he says, has sparked interest among other companies based there. </p> <p>The corporate market is also being targeted by one of six web-based companies now in the car share market, Paul Cutler's shareajourney.com. </p> <p>\"More than 70% of car drivers don't use any form of public transport because of the flexibility of the car,\" Cutler says. \"The only realistic way to make any impact on road traffic congestion is to try to persuade people to join car sharing clubs.\" </p> <p>Despite the strength of our attachment to the car, there is cautious optimism about the future of car sharing. As Chas Ball says: \"Car clubs will become mainstream because local authorities, developers, employers and government will see that this is a way to give access to the car without us all having to own one.\" </p> <p><strong>Miles of smiles</strong></p> <p>Jo Rathbone joined Coventry's car club last July. She says: \"Having given up my car I feel that I'm getting more control over my life. Not having immediate access to a car means that your life slows down ever so slightly. It's easier to say no to things, which is great.\" </p> <p>As a social worker, 38-year-old Rathbone needed a car for work. But when she gave up her job three years ago, she and her husband, Dan, set up an informal car share arrangement with a neighbouring family. Having found that this trial run posed no problems, the couple had no hesitation joining the official Coventry car club, which was launched last July. </p> <p>\"The biggest advantage of the car club is that your car isn't parked outside your front door, so you don't jump in it for journeys that really don't need a car,\" says Rathbone. \"You plan much more carefully for those occasions when you do need a car.\" </p> <p>The couple now have access to two cars a 10-minute walk from their house, and use them for trips they can't make on public transport, whether it's visiting IKEA to load up with shelving or taking the children to parties and to see relatives. </p> <p>As well as the money saved from not running a car, the family has benefited in other ways. \"I bought a good bike with the savings we made and now I'm a lot fitter from cycling everywhere,\" says Rathbone. </p> <p>\"I also feel that I'm making choices that are not only good for me, but are good for my community and environment - and that feels really good.\" </p> <p>Community Car Share Network is on 0113-234 9299; Smart Moves is on 024-7623 6292; the Association for Commuter Transport is on 020-7348 1987.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Our love affair with the car may be verging on the obsessive and threatening disastrous environmental and economic consequences. But a conference today will hear how we can renegotiate our relationship with the internal combustion engine and bring about a new car culture. The solution, it will be argued, is to share vehicle ownership. \"Car share clubs are an innovative alternative to owning a car, freeing the individual to choose the best transport option for their trip,\" says Antonio Roberts, of the Community Car Share Network (CCSN), which is hosting today's conference in Luton. \"Ultimately, car clubs can reduce congestion and pollution and, with car club vehicles on average replacing five privately owned cars, the pressure on parking spaces is eased.\" The network takes its cue from the experiences of European countries, where more than 100,000 people are members of some 100 clubs and use car sharing as an everyday part of their transport mix. \"Over a decade of car share clubs has shown that, on average, members reduce their car mileage by half and replace this with a combination of public transport, cycling and walking,\" says Roberts. The way a car share club works is that a member books a car by telephoning a call centre, then picks up the vehicle - usually parked within a 10-minute walk of the caller's house, with the keys kept in a nearby safe. The member notes the mileage in a log book at the beginning and end of every journey. Members pay a one-off \u00a325 joining fee plus a returnable \u00a3100 insurance deposit, and there is a \u00a310-a-month fee on top. Generally, members are charged \u00a33 for the first hour of car use, \u00a32 for each subsequent hour, and around 15p a mile. These charges compare favourably with the experience of those in existing European schemes. People who clock up around 6,000 miles a year - that's about 45% of UK motorists - could save up to \u00a31,500 on their annual motoring costs. Today's conference marks a coming of age for car sharing clubs in Britain. Since CCSN was launched in 1999, its organisers have opted for a low-profile approach that has fostered the launch of 11 car clubs with total membership of just under 1,000. \"We didn't want to raise expecta tions and not be in a position to deliver a service,\" says Roberts. \"As it takes time to reduce dependency on the car, it was vital that we were in a position to offer a service that was convenient, reliable and affordable.\" Roberts admits that the environmental benefits of car share clubs are not a big factor when people come to decide about giving up their own vehicle. \"Personal benefit is the primary motivating factor,\" he says. Chas Ball, co-director of the car club service provider Smart Moves, believes that, for their long-term success, car clubs need not only careful nurturing but also the right set of conditions. \"Currently, a number of factors are working against car clubs. For instance, the plummeting price of second-hand cars isn't helping, nor is the public perception of public transport, which, since the recent train crashes, has nose-dived.\" However, Ball takes heart from what he sees as pro-active support from a growing number of local authorities. And while community-based car share clubs are taking their first tentative steps, employer-led schemes are enjoying something of a boom. \"The response has been phenomenal in recent years,\" says Katherine Mitchell, of the Association for Commuter Transport (ACT). Launched in 1997 with the aim of \"promoting sustainable transport and reduced car dependency through the adoption of commuter travel planning\", ACT now has more than 120 members, the majority of whom are blue-chip corporates ranging from Marks &amp; Spencer and Boots to drugs manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca. \"So many people now drive to work by themselves that company car parks soon get full up,\" Mitchell says. \"If the company wants to expand, it often has no more available parking space.\" Company car share schemes usually involve lift-sharing, he says. \"By offering these schemes, they can get more employees into their sites.\" One of the biggest employer-led schemes is the Royal Bank of Scotland's, with more than half the 3,000 employees at its South Gyle business park operation, outside Edinburgh, now signed up to share lifts. \"Business parks have always faced bigger transport problems than the inner-city because of a lack of proper transport infrastructure,\" says David Graham, the bank's environment manager. \"People just became exasperated by the gridlocked conditions that occur here everyday.\" Graham estimates that the scheme has led to a reduction of 650 cars a day entering the business park. Its success, he says, has sparked interest among other companies based there. The corporate market is also being targeted by one of six web-based companies now in the car share market, Paul Cutler's shareajourney.com. \"More than 70% of car drivers don't use any form of public transport because of the flexibility of the car,\" Cutler says. \"The only realistic way to make any impact on road traffic congestion is to try to persuade people to join car sharing clubs.\" Despite the strength of our attachment to the car, there is cautious optimism about the future of car sharing. As Chas Ball says: \"Car clubs will become mainstream because local authorities, developers, employers and government will see that this is a way to give access to the car without us all having to own one.\" Miles of smiles Jo Rathbone joined Coventry's car club last July. She says: \"Having given up my car I feel that I'm getting more control over my life. Not having immediate access to a car means that your life slows down ever so slightly. It's easier to say no to things, which is great.\" As a social worker, 38-year-old Rathbone needed a car for work. But when she gave up her job three years ago, she and her husband, Dan, set up an informal car share arrangement with a neighbouring family. Having found that this trial run posed no problems, the couple had no hesitation joining the official Coventry car club, which was launched last July. \"The biggest advantage of the car club is that your car isn't parked outside your front door, so you don't jump in it for journeys that really don't need a car,\" says Rathbone. \"You plan much more carefully for those occasions when you do need a car.\" The couple now have access to two cars a 10-minute walk from their house, and use them for trips they can't make on public transport, whether it's visiting IKEA to load up with shelving or taking the children to parties and to see relatives. As well as the money saved from not running a car, the family has benefited in other ways. \"I bought a good bike with the savings we made and now I'm a lot fitter from cycling everywhere,\" says Rathbone. \"I also feel that I'm making choices that are not only good for me, but are good for my community and environment - and that feels really good.\" Community Car Share Network is on 0113-234 9299; Smart Moves is on 024-7623 6292; the Association for Commuter Transport is on 020-7348 1987.",

      "body": "<p>On what was only its second birthday, in 1984, a leader in the Times dismissed it as \"the biggest administrative fiasco in the history of the welfare state\". Next month, the fiasco otherwise known as housing benefit will be 18 years old - but the bureaucratic nightmare that began at its birth has only worsened. </p> <p>Thousands of claimants are in debt, with delays in payment forcing them into rent arrears. Others are at risk of eviction. Intended to help the most vulnerable, Britain's crumbling housing benefit system appears to be doing the very opposite. </p> <p>To coincide with the 18th anniversary, the National Housing Federation (NHF), representing 1,400 housing associations, has produced a report into the failures. The report, Housing Benefit - No Cause to Celebrate, reveals that 1.5m of Britain's 4m housing benefit claimants, are owed money - totalling up to \u00a31.6 bn. </p> <p>A straw poll of 500 people surveyed for the report found that two-thirds were owed an average \u00a31,102, experiencing delays of up to five months. According to the NHF, housing associations are owed a total \u00a384m in late benefit payments. </p> <p>Although housing benefit was introduced in 1982, its roots lie in housing subsidies launched in 1919 to make council rents more affordable. By 1972, local authorities were obliged to provide rebates for their own tenants and allowances for private tenants. The existence of two schemes was confusing, and so housing benefit was born. But it was introduced with such haste, and without any support to councils, that administrative chaos ensued. </p> <p>A Commons social security select committee report last year blamed the chaos on privatisation and red tape. The volume of claims overwhelms contractors who run housing benefit services. In Lambeth, south London, a backlog of 40,000 claims last year forced the Labour council to spend \u00a31.5m helping its contractor, Capita, to process paperwork. </p> <p>As for red tape, in 1999 there were 85 government-inspired regulation changes, mostly to do with fraud detection. They required new computer software and a reorganisation of how claims were processed. Councils were given little warning of the changes. Today's NHF report states: \"Some initiatives designed to tackle fraud have themselves become part of the problem. Information required by the government's verification framework lengthens the process considerably and puts off some of those genuinely entitled to claim.\" </p> <p>The system also suffers in-built problems. Where housing benefit is paid direct to the landlord, it is paid four weeks in arrears. This automatically puts the tenant in arrears, since their tenancy will usually require rent in advance. </p> <p>Another complication arises when a claimant's employment situation changes - even if it is just a few hours' work - and the claim has to be adjusted. In some cases, housing benefit stops completely; in others, benefit is paid as before and, months later, the claimant is told they have been overpaid. </p> <p>Debra (not her real name), a lone parent from London with two young children, had a part-time job at a shop last summer. At Christmas, her local authority decided she was no longer eligible for housing benefit. Now she owes \u00a3800. She says: \"Before I took the job I kept checking with advisers that I'd be better off. Not once did they warn me by how much my housing benefit could drop. I feel betrayed.\" </p> <p>Benefit also has to be amended if recipients have adult children or ex-partners living with them. The amount received is reduced, the assumption being that the non-dependants can make a contribution to the rent. </p> <p>Last year, a pressure group of London's biggest housing associations, known as G15, became so exasperated with the housing benefit system that it urged the government to strip councils of their responsibility for it. The government's housing green paper came down against such a drastic step, but suggested \"expert help teams\" to support struggling authorities. </p> <p>And while no one expects the anti-fraud measures to be scrapped, landlords and benefit officers agree that the government must simplify the system. The NHF says claimants should be eligible for awards of housing benefit for a fixed period - maybe six months - and that the policy on non-dependants must be reviewed.

      "bodyText": "On what was only its second birthday, in 1984, a leader in the Times dismissed it as \"the biggest administrative fiasco in the history of the welfare state\". Next month, the fiasco otherwise known as housing benefit will be 18 years old - but the bureaucratic nightmare that began at its birth has only worsened. Thousands of claimants are in debt, with delays in payment forcing them into rent arrears. Others are at risk of eviction. Intended to help the most vulnerable, Britain's crumbling housing benefit system appears to be doing the very opposite. To coincide with the 18th anniversary, the National Housing Federation (NHF), representing 1,400 housing associations, has produced a report into the failures. The report, Housing Benefit - No Cause to Celebrate, reveals that 1.5m of Britain's 4m housing benefit claimants, are owed money - totalling up to \u00a31.6 bn. A straw poll of 500 people surveyed for the report found that two-thirds were owed an average \u00a31,102, experiencing delays of up to five months. According to the NHF, housing associations are owed a total \u00a384m in late benefit payments. Although housing benefit was introduced in 1982, its roots lie in housing subsidies launched in 1919 to make council rents more affordable. By 1972, local authorities were obliged to provide rebates for their own tenants and allowances for private tenants. The existence of two schemes was confusing, and so housing benefit was born. But it was introduced with such haste, and without any support to councils, that administrative chaos ensued. A Commons social security select committee report last year blamed the chaos on privatisation and red tape. The volume of claims overwhelms contractors who run housing benefit services. In Lambeth, south London, a backlog of 40,000 claims last year forced the Labour council to spend \u00a31.5m helping its contractor, Capita, to process paperwork. As for red tape, in 1999 there were 85 government-inspired regulation changes, mostly to do with fraud detection. They required new computer software and a reorganisation of how claims were processed. Councils were given little warning of the changes. Today's NHF report states: \"Some initiatives designed to tackle fraud have themselves become part of the problem. Information required by the government's verification framework lengthens the process considerably and puts off some of those genuinely entitled to claim.\" The system also suffers in-built problems. Where housing benefit is paid direct to the landlord, it is paid four weeks in arrears. This automatically puts the tenant in arrears, since their tenancy will usually require rent in advance. Another complication arises when a claimant's employment situation changes - even if it is just a few hours' work - and the claim has to be adjusted. In some cases, housing benefit stops completely; in others, benefit is paid as before and, months later, the claimant is told they have been overpaid. Debra (not her real name), a lone parent from London with two young children, had a part-time job at a shop last summer. At Christmas, her local authority decided she was no longer eligible for housing benefit. Now she owes \u00a3800. She says: \"Before I took the job I kept checking with advisers that I'd be better off. Not once did they warn me by how much my housing benefit could drop. I feel betrayed.\" Benefit also has to be amended if recipients have adult children or ex-partners living with them. The amount received is reduced, the assumption being that the non-dependants can make a contribution to the rent. Last year, a pressure group of London's biggest housing associations, known as G15, became so exasperated with the housing benefit system that it urged the government to strip councils of their responsibility for it. The government's housing green paper came down against such a drastic step, but suggested \"expert help teams\" to support struggling authorities. And while no one expects the anti-fraud measures to be scrapped, landlords and benefit officers agree that the government must simplify the system. The NHF says claimants should be eligible for awards of housing benefit for a fixed period - maybe six months - and that the policy on non-dependants must be reviewed. It says the four-weeks-in-arrears rule should end and landlord and tenant representatives must be involved in the help teams to improve administration. Experts are also demanding more research into whether the introduction of the verification framework was worth the negative impact on efficiency and the human cost of the crisis. Jim Coulter, the federation's chief executive, says: \"Housing benefit administration is bringing misery and hardship for some of the least well-off and most vulnerable. Over its 18 years of life, it has become too bureaucratic, too complex and has lost its way.\" \u0095 Housing Benefit - No Cause to Celebrate is available free from the National Housing Federation on 020 7843 2234.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Stuart Etherington, chief executive, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO)</strong></p> <p> The voluntary sector is now truly the third sector in every respect. One in 50 employees works for a charity, contributing the equivalent of more than 350,000 full-time jobs to the economy and as nearly \u00a35bn to the GDP.</p> <p>NCVO has set out its own election manifesto, which is an agenda for change for the next general election on behalf of the voluntary sector in England. We consulted our 1,700 members on the manifesto and its contents. The set of general principles and specific proposals contained in this manifesto could and should be adopted by all the political parties.</p> <p>The manifesto's recommendations include a number of key fiscal measures, which can be easily implemented by any government to create the economic environment in which voluntary organisations can flourish. They include:</p> <p>\u0095 Government should maintain, enhance and promote the current tax incentives for donating to charity. In particular, business should be encouraged to contribute more to the development of the voluntary sector.</p> <p>\u0095 Government funding of voluntary organisations should be undertaken on a long-term, multi-year basis, include the funding of core activities and meet the costs of engagement that voluntary organisations face.</p> <p>\u0095 Government should introduce a VAT rebate scheme for the voluntary sector.</p> <p>\u0095 Long-term financial and infrastructure support for the development of the sector must ensure that it has the capacity to train and develop its staff and volunteers.</p> <p><strong>Shirley Scott, director of Charity Finance Directors' Group (CFDG)</strong></p> <p>CFDG strongly believes that a future government should actively promote public confidence and trust in the voluntary sector and the way in which it manages its finances. We want the next government to convey the fact that charities are not here to fleece the public.</p> <p>The next government must also realise that volunteers need training and managing. As much as we welcome the initiatives that the present government has taken in relation to volunteers, there must be recognition from political parties that charities have to pay the people who are supervising them. </p> <p>We want the next government to look at taxation and find ways to fund the growth in charities that all political parties want to see. On the question of VAT, we are interested in those little niches that have been knocked into the rock by, for example, churches, which can reclaim VAT for repairs and museums for their entry fees. We want to see if we can open up that wedge a bit further.</p> <p>However, we are wary of balancing the request for VAT relief against the extra statutory concessions that we already receive.

      "bodyText": "Stuart Etherington, chief executive, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) The voluntary sector is now truly the third sector in every respect. One in 50 employees works for a charity, contributing the equivalent of more than 350,000 full-time jobs to the economy and as nearly \u00a35bn to the GDP. NCVO has set out its own election manifesto, which is an agenda for change for the next general election on behalf of the voluntary sector in England. We consulted our 1,700 members on the manifesto and its contents. The set of general principles and specific proposals contained in this manifesto could and should be adopted by all the political parties. The manifesto's recommendations include a number of key fiscal measures, which can be easily implemented by any government to create the economic environment in which voluntary organisations can flourish. They include: \u0095 Government should maintain, enhance and promote the current tax incentives for donating to charity. In particular, business should be encouraged to contribute more to the development of the voluntary sector. \u0095 Government funding of voluntary organisations should be undertaken on a long-term, multi-year basis, include the funding of core activities and meet the costs of engagement that voluntary organisations face. \u0095 Government should introduce a VAT rebate scheme for the voluntary sector. \u0095 Long-term financial and infrastructure support for the development of the sector must ensure that it has the capacity to train and develop its staff and volunteers. Shirley Scott, director of Charity Finance Directors' Group (CFDG) CFDG strongly believes that a future government should actively promote public confidence and trust in the voluntary sector and the way in which it manages its finances. We want the next government to convey the fact that charities are not here to fleece the public. The next government must also realise that volunteers need training and managing. As much as we welcome the initiatives that the present government has taken in relation to volunteers, there must be recognition from political parties that charities have to pay the people who are supervising them. We want the next government to look at taxation and find ways to fund the growth in charities that all political parties want to see. On the question of VAT, we are interested in those little niches that have been knocked into the rock by, for example, churches, which can reclaim VAT for repairs and museums for their entry fees. We want to see if we can open up that wedge a bit further. However, we are wary of balancing the request for VAT relief against the extra statutory concessions that we already receive. If we shout too loudly, it might be peeled off the other end. We are very keen to support any government scheme which gets more resources into the voluntary sector, but we are also very aware of the pressure this places on the voluntary sector to raise more voluntary income for matched funding. A future government needs to recognise that there is a cost connected to raising money for matched funding. Stephen Burgess, charities consultant, Saffrey Champness, and former director of finance, Help the Aged I expect there will be a return in the next 20 to 30 years to the older style of philanthropy, which characterised the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At that time, industrialists saw their role as providers of education, health and community support.

Individuals and companies need to recognise it is in their economic interest to be better citizens. The government needs to encourage this and make more tax changes to encourage giving.

It was often extremely hard, from reading the report and accounts, to work out what a charity was up to or to compare it with other voluntary organisations. That all begin to change in 1995 when the statement of recommended practice (Sorp) was launched, a new accounting framework aimed at improving consistency and accountability. Now, \"son of Sorp\" has been brought in to further improve the way charities present their financial situation. The new Sorp is being presented not as a radical change to the original but as an evolution.</p> <p>It also puts a lot more emphasis on the reporting of activities and aims to give the reader of trustees' reports a much clearer picture of the charity's activities. \"The overwhelming drive is to bring more openness to charity accounting and make it more accessible,\" says Alan Sharpe, finance director at bird welfare charity RSPB.</p> <p>He adds that the changes are largely welcome, given the growing public and media scrutiny of charities.

There will be a clearer presentation of how funds are raised and how much is spent raising those funds. Trustees will also have to say what controls they have in place to reduce operational and financial risks.</p> <p>But some in the sector argue that the changes will not prevent the kind of blurring between what a charity says it has spent on fundraising and administration and what it has spent on charitable services. \"A lot of charities disguise their central costs and you see big variations between charities in similar fields; I don't think the new Sorp will improve things here,\" says Jackie Bliss, director of finance and administration at child welfare charity Coram Family. Fears about public criticism that they are spending too much on central management have encouraged some charity finance directors to engage in \"creative accounting\". Bliss believes that perhaps more guidance is still needed on how to distinguish between central management costs and charitable spending: \"It's still too easy to disguise central costs by putting some through the provision of direct services.\"</p> <p>But she welcomes many of the changes in the new Sorp, such as the wide definition of what can be regarded as the costs of generating funds. The new Sorp, for example, will allow Coram Family to treat its investment management costs as fundraising not as overheads. \"That means quite a lot to us because more than a quarter of our income is from investments,\" she says. There is some concern, however, that the requirement to show how much has been spent on specific fundraising activities and what has been raised in income could distort the true picture. Some fundraising campaigns require a large initial investment but only pay that back over several years, which could lead to an unbalanced picture by looking at the situation in one year in isolation, says Bliss.</p> <p>Pesh Framjee, head of the charity unit at accountants Binder Hamlyn and a member of the committee that drew up the new Sorp, says the focus of many of the changes is on how the accounts are reported.</p> <p>Trustees will have to look carefully at what the charity's policy is in areas such as reserves or investments and describe their general strategy for the organisation. \"All this should focus trustees' minds on what the charity is doing and what it should be seeking to do,\" says Framjee.</p> <p>The RSPB's Alan Sharpe notes that previously the trustees' report was quite prescriptive and there was a temptation to adopt a \"checklist approach\" without necessarily embracing the spirit of the exercise. \"I think under the new Sorp, people will get a much clearer idea of what a charity is trying to do,\" he says.</p> <p>Another area where a charity's activities will become clearer is in trading. Rather than just showing a lump sum of income, the new guidance on presenting information about the generation of funds means charities will have to show how much income comes from their shops, fundraising events and so on.</p> <p>Risk assessment is another area of the new accounting guidelines that many smaller charities are concerned about. Framjee says questions of how risks are managed has been a significant issue for the corporate sector for several years.</p> <p>\"It would be wrong for people to see it as a compliance issue,\" he says: \"It's like wearing a seatbelt: you should do it because it's good for the organisation, not because you feel you have to.\"</p> <p>Sharpe says a lot of larger charities already have separate procedures in place to minimise risks to their operations: \"It will be a case of bringing those measures together under an overall risk-control policy.\"</p> <p>The new Sorp relates to accounting periods beginning on or after January 1 2001 and affects the accounts of charities with an income of more than \u00a3100,000 and all charitable companies.</p> <p><strong>Will the changes lead to the sell-off of 'old masters'?</strong></p> <p>Some charities are concerned that one element in the new Sorp could put pressure on them to sell off assets that were never meant to leave their hands.</p> <p>This is because there will be a much tighter requirement on charities to account for \"historic or inalienable assets\", often works of art or other assets donated by either the founders or the supporters of the charity.</p> <p>Charities will have to put a value on these assets and include them on the balance sheet.

Will the changes lead to the sell-off of 'old masters'? Some charities are concerned that one element in the new Sorp could put pressure on them to sell off assets that were never meant to leave their hands. This is because there will be a much tighter requirement on charities to account for \"historic or inalienable assets\", often works of art or other assets donated by either the founders or the supporters of the charity. Charities will have to put a value on these assets and include them on the balance sheet. Coram Family's Jackie Bliss says that if these assets are truly inalienable, in other words if they are not able to be transferred or sold, listing their value in the accounts gives a false impression of wealth. \"It suggests to the reader of the accounts that the asset is a financial one and hence capable of being liquidated to increase cash reserves,\" she says. The danger, says Bliss, is that it is only a short step from there for public and media comment to expect such assets to be sold, as an alternative to fundraising. \"This is a very complex area.

      "body": "<p>Regulation and scrutiny have intensified sharply since the passing of the charities acts in 1992 and 1993. In England and Wales, all but the very smallest charities now have to submit an annual return and accounts to the charity commission.</p> <p>No big deal, perhaps, and a degree of scrutiny is more than justified in a sector with an estimated annual income approaching \u00a330bn a year, in which the constituent organisations enjoy tax breaks and privileged access to funding. But as you get bigger, the requirements become more challenging. Charities turning over \u00a3100,000 or more have to follow the commission's statement of recommended practice on accounting (Sorp).</p> <p>The disclosures set out in this document make a good deal of sense when it comes to reporting charities' success in using their funds to pursue their stated objectives. Unfortunately the resulting format for charity accounts is so far removed from regular company accounts that many accountants who do not deal regularly with charities would be hard pressed to prepare them in the time it would take to knock out the accounts for a comparably sized limited company. </p> <p>If a statutory audit is required, costs can really start to rise. For charities this happens automatically when incoming resources exceed \u00a3250,000 a year, far below the \u00a31m threshold now in force for limited companies. A survey carried out late last year by Charity Finance magazine found that charities in the lowest income bracket for which an audit is compulsory, paid an average of \u00a32,723 for their audit. That may not sound much, but for many charities, almost all income comes in the form of grants for specific projects.</p> <p>Most auditors specialising in the charity sector believe that fees will rise over the next few years. One factor is the continuing trend among audit firms to merge. Firms combine to meet the sophisticated demands of large clients; this pushes up their overheads, which must be passed on. </p> <p>At the same time, a shrinking pool of firms from which charities can buy specialist expertise is bound to reduce the incentive to compete on fees. </p> <p>Meanwhile many organisations are being pushed into having a full audit even when the charity's income is well below the statutory threshold. Andrew Dinkenor, a community accountant working in south London, says: \"The local authority requires that any group receiving a grant from it which has an income of \u00a310,000 or more must have a full audit.</p> <p>In addition, those in receipt of grants from different sources are likely to find that each funder has its own ideas about what information it needs. Reports to funders rarely call for information that a well-run charity wouldn't be recording anyway. But preparing it in the various formats and collecting back-up evidence takes time and money. </p> <p>And while they are keen to impose rigorous reporting demands on charities, most funders are not so interested in paying for the time and expertise that goes into meeting those demands. It's a burden they have to live with, and the price to pay for funding from institutions. Kate Sayer, partner at charity auditors Sayer Vincent, believes that there's a limit to how far reporting structures can be aligned. As she points out: \"There might be room for streamlining, but at the end of the day you have to be accountable to your funders.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Heather Lamont is editor of Charity Finance magazine</p>",

      "bodyText": "Regulation and scrutiny have intensified sharply since the passing of the charities acts in 1992 and 1993. In England and Wales, all but the very smallest charities now have to submit an annual return and accounts to the charity commission. No big deal, perhaps, and a degree of scrutiny is more than justified in a sector with an estimated annual income approaching \u00a330bn a year, in which the constituent organisations enjoy tax breaks and privileged access to funding. But as you get bigger, the requirements become more challenging. Charities turning over \u00a3100,000 or more have to follow the commission's statement of recommended practice on accounting (Sorp). The disclosures set out in this document make a good deal of sense when it comes to reporting charities' success in using their funds to pursue their stated objectives. Unfortunately the resulting format for charity accounts is so far removed from regular company accounts that many accountants who do not deal regularly with charities would be hard pressed to prepare them in the time it would take to knock out the accounts for a comparably sized limited company. If a statutory audit is required, costs can really start to rise. For charities this happens automatically when incoming resources exceed \u00a3250,000 a year, far below the \u00a31m threshold now in force for limited companies. A survey carried out late last year by Charity Finance magazine found that charities in the lowest income bracket for which an audit is compulsory, paid an average of \u00a32,723 for their audit. That may not sound much, but for many charities, almost all income comes in the form of grants for specific projects. Most auditors specialising in the charity sector believe that fees will rise over the next few years. One factor is the continuing trend among audit firms to merge. Firms combine to meet the sophisticated demands of large clients; this pushes up their overheads, which must be passed on. At the same time, a shrinking pool of firms from which charities can buy specialist expertise is bound to reduce the incentive to compete on fees. Meanwhile many organisations are being pushed into having a full audit even when the charity's income is well below the statutory threshold. Andrew Dinkenor, a community accountant working in south London, says: \"The local authority requires that any group receiving a grant from it which has an income of \u00a310,000 or more must have a full audit. In addition, those in receipt of grants from different sources are likely to find that each funder has its own ideas about what information it needs. Reports to funders rarely call for information that a well-run charity wouldn't be recording anyway. But preparing it in the various formats and collecting back-up evidence takes time and money. And while they are keen to impose rigorous reporting demands on charities, most funders are not so interested in paying for the time and expertise that goes into meeting those demands. It's a burden they have to live with, and the price to pay for funding from institutions. Kate Sayer, partner at charity auditors Sayer Vincent, believes that there's a limit to how far reporting structures can be aligned. As she points out: \"There might be room for streamlining, but at the end of the day you have to be accountable to your funders.\" \u0095 Heather Lamont is editor of Charity Finance magazine",

She has seen at first hand that some benefit changes, perversely, have made it harder for lone parents who want to work. She has mixed views about her school being in an education action zone (EAZ) but is delighted at the plentiful funds available for repairing buildings. </p> <p>\"We're at the cutting edge of poverty here,\" says Buchanan. Keen to help local unemployment, she recruits parents as classroom assistants. But some say they are worse off working than claiming benefit. A lone mother, one of four assistants, found that her classroom job meant she moved off income support on to working families tax credit. With weekly dinner money totalling \u00a318.75 for three children, and with full rent and council tax to pay, the woman was unable to manage on her school earnings. She asked to be cut to 16 hours, so she would again be eligible for benefits. </p> <p>All the social problems of the estates are evident in the school. The counter-attack against deprivation begins at eight every morning with the breakfast club, one of six at Salford schools provided by Kellogg's, as an EAZ sponsor. It is one of the few aspects of the zones that Buchanan says has worked. But a budget of \u00a3750,000 split among 18 schools \"doesn't go anywhere\", she observes. \"The government was relying on the excitement of big business throwing money at education, but it never happened.\" </p> <p>Far better, she reckons, is the \"excellence in cities\" initiative. That has paid for a full-time learning mentor for four years. The role of the school is transformed by this way of providing pastoral care: the mentor \"can do home visits for reluctant attenders; [run] anger management courses; liaise with multi-agency workers\". And possibly best of all, the school having had to spend \u00a378,000 over eight years on repairs to redress vandalism, are the funds flowing in under Labour for repairs and refurbishment: \u00a325,000 for a security fence, \u00a3120,000 for central heating. \"We're even redecorating for the first time in 18 years,\" she says. </p> <p><strong> Dr Lawrence Addlestone</strong> says: \"I don't honestly see that anything any government has ever done has made any difference round here in the 12 years I've been a GP here.\" His five-partner practice has some 8,000 patients from the Langworthy area. He is sure that social problems have changed little, with the exception of never now seeing cases of malnourishment. Addlestone is critical of Labour for ending GP fundholding, which had been introduced by the Conservatives. </p> <p>\"We found it very empowering, and managed to do a lot more for our patients,\" he says. \"We've had to fight very hard to keep what we had. \"We had started a chiropractic service, but money for that is now limited. We had a cardiologist who would come once a week to see heart patients, but that's been withdrawn by Manchester Royal Infirmary. We had the services of a counsellor but now have to go through a central service, so instead of appointments for depressed patients within a few days, it now takes two or three months.\" </p> <p>As for shorter hospital waiting lists, he says: \"The impact has been on the statistics, not at the grassroots. Things have got slightly worse in some specialisms - orthopaedics, for instance - and some hospitals.\" The practice has access to three big hospitals, one of which often has a shorter waiting time than the others. Addlestone frequently finds himself sending off three referral letters at the same time for the same patient: the system just has to be played that way. He acknowledges that the new local primary care trust oversees the needs of an area covered by several practices and hospitals. \"I suppose it is more equitable,\" he says, \"but this government was supposed to bring everybody up to the highest standard - and all we've seen is that standards have gone down.\" </p> <p><strong> PC Paul Cusick</strong> says that, with the old-style beat bobby having been reinvented new-style by Greater Manchester Police, he needs to know as much about regeneration initiatives as crime initiatives on his patch of Salford. Crime in all its aspects on the estates is worrying, but fear of crime is even more potent, he says. And he is sympathetic to disaffected youth. \"We have to move gangs of young people; but we do understand there are very few youth clubs and cafes round here. Sometimes there are groups of 30 or 40. But in all honesty, half the time the kids are only gathering like that because they're frightened of another gang - though they wouldn't admit it.\" </p> <p>Cusick reckons that the new partnerships among professional groups are an excellent way of working, \"rather than keeping it in our own backyard\". He adds: \"Before, everything was bunged on the police, and it got to the point where we were doing everything.\" Early days yet, though, for spectacular results. \"To look at the area, there's not been a vast improvement, I'm afraid. For the initiatives that have been brought in recently, we haven't got the cash yet. But we're hoping to get millions and millions from New Deal.\" That could mean new landscapes, new lives. And Cusick is optimistic - even though in his part of Salford, where sector policing has been introduced, his team of eight beat officers is two under strength.</p> <p><strong> Rita McNamara </strong> , education officer for the Salford youth offending team, is a fan of the home secretary - certainly as far as the Crime and Disorder Act is concerned. With magistrates now handing out action plans (of three months' duration) and supervision orders (which can run for up to three years), she says: \"We're surrounding young offenders with a blanket of support.\" The new set-up means that McNamara shares an office with police, and health and social work staff. This brings the advantage that \"we weave in and out of each other's cases in the youth action team\". </p> <p>For the first time, she believes, the education needs of youngsters who start as truants, then turn to crime, are being properly addressed. And a proper effort is being made to insert them back into an appropriate niche in the education system. But she says the government must try even harder. \"More money needs to be put into alternative provision; and more training for teachers on working with very, very disaffected children, because we're putting them back into the system, and teacher training doesn't teach them how to deal with that. \"I would like all our young people to be comfortable enough to go back into the mainstream. And when it isn't possible, there should be an immediate place for them in other centres where their education needs are catered for - and I don't mean a second-class education.

      "body": "<p>Why, do you suppose, did the last prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, and Israel's revered elder statesman, Shimon Peres, both intervene to ask Bill Clinton, as one of his last acts as US president, to pardon Marc Rich, a fugitive from American justice, wanted for a mere $48m in unpaid American taxes? Why did the Israeli foreign minister, Shlomo Bel-Ami, actually put the arm on the King of Spain to join his entreaties that Rich should be pardoned?</p> <p>Was it simply that Mr Rich is a good friend of Israel and a generous donor to Israeli causes? Unlikely.</p> <p>The strong probability is that Marc Rich deserved Israeli gratitude because he played a crucial part in helping Israel secure enough oil, at the time of the Arab oil boycott of 1973, to survive. I say the strong probability, because although this has never been mentioned in the miles of column inches devoted to \"Pardongate\", 15 years ago, when I was researching a book about some consequences of the oil crisis on the world shipping market, several informants assured me that Rich had indeed been involved in rescuing Israel in an hour of need.</p> <p>Nothing less, you might think, would explain the truly extraordinary, high-level lobbying for a pardon for a fugitive commodities trader who was behind on his taxes.</p> <p>The disreputable status of Marc Rich has attracted attention in this country not only because of the scandal of his last-minute pardon by an outgoing US president, but because throughout much of the 1980s, Rich also used to employ Alan Duncan, the friend of Conservative leader William Hague and currently shadow trade spokesman.</p> <p>Marc Rich's Israeli connection is a matter for speculation. But what is not in doubt is that Rich was heavily involved in busting sanctions applied to another country. He certainly played a major part in finding oil from many sources, but conspicuously from Brunei, for the apartheid regime in South Africa.</p> <p>In so doing, Rich found himself in a world of marine cowboys. It was peopled by Greeks under investigation for piracy, and by at least one Italian with dubious connections with the shadowy world where intelligence and fascism rubbed shoulders. In fact, the South Africans' desperate need for oil brought out of the woodwork a whole fauna of more or less shady businessmen from Hong Kong to Houston by way of the Piraeus and of Zug, the trim, Swiss lakeside town where Marc Rich had his headquarters.</p> <p>Bill Clinton is idolised by millions of African Americans. Would they be quite so keen on him if they knew he had used his pardon power to help a man who had made large amounts of money by breaking the embargo, imposed by the sub-Saharan African countries and their Arab allies, on South Africa?</p> <p>Until the fall of the Shah in 1979 the South Africans could get some oil from Iran. After he fell, they were in serious trouble. According to an American academic study, Sasol, the South African state oil company, turned to two men to save its supplies. One was a Dutchman, John Deuss, who until 1977 had been trading in Soviet oil. Within the year, Deuss found 18m tons of oil, most of it from Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>As early as April 1979 Marc Rich had negotiated an initial contract to deliver 50m barrels of oil to South Africa. The oil, delivered through a company called Minoil, came from many sources, among them Brunei. But after mid-1981 Royal Dutch Shell, not wanting to incur the bad publicity and government pressure that could come from continuing to break the embargo, broke up its partnership with the government of Brunei. Marc Rich stepped in and arranged deliveries from Brunei himself.</p> <p>Rich's activities and already brought him into odd company. In 1979, in the biggest casualty ever up to that time in terms of tonnage lost, the Atlantic Empress, of 292,000 tons dead weight, collided with the Aegean Captain, of 210,000 dwt, off Tobago in a storm. The Aegean Captain is believed to have been loaded with bootleg oil for South Africa, and to have been under charter to Rich or one of his companies at the time.</p> <p>M ore bizarre was the fate of the Salem, a supertanker which secretly unloaded 192,000 tons of oil in Durban as part of an elaborate conspiracy involving representatives of the South African government and a number of businessmen. On January 17 1980 the Salem sank in one of the deepest trenches in the Atlantic off the coast of Guinea. The mere chance that brought a BP tanker to the scene and found the crew sitting with their duty frees in the lifeboats, led to the revelation that the Salem had been scuttled. Both the ship and the oil that had been unloaded at Durban had been heavily insured at Lloyd's.</p> <p>The scuttling and insurance scam, presumably, was an elaboration of the basic plan, to use Salem to deliver oil to South Africa through the embargo. But telephone transcripts showed that the delivery of the oil at Durban was reported to the Salem's owner and a confederate in, of all places, Zug, where the owner had business connections.</p> <p>The Salem's skipper, a certain Dimitrios, or \"Jimmy\", Georgoulis, is said to have practised driving a supertanker on another ship, the Albahaa B, which was also to have been used to deliver oil to South Africa, but blew up, allegedly as a result of incompetent cleaning of her tanks. The owner of the Albahaa B subsequently lost his life in a mysterious plane crash over the Sudan desert. There were rumours at the time that his plane had been shot down by the Libyan air force.</p> <p>The great operation to get oil to the South Africans through the embargo is still surrounded by mystery, rumour, secrecy, even paranoia. But what is certain is that Marc Rich was up to his ears in it. Very probably, he built up his contacts in the oil shipping world, and in particular his acquaintance among those who were prepared to take a risk to life or reputation to make very considerable amounts of money, to his earlier experience of running the oil embargo of Israel.</p> <p>Whatever Rich's precise involvement in the wilder shores of sanctions busting, there is no doubt at all that he was at the heart of the conspiracy to help the South Africans.</p> <p>Godfrey Hodgson is director of the Reuter Foundation Programme at Green College, Oxford.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:godfrey.hodgson@green.oxford.ac.uk\">godfrey.hodgson@green.oxford.ac.uk </a></p>",

In fact, the South Africans' desperate need for oil brought out of the woodwork a whole fauna of more or less shady businessmen from Hong Kong to Houston by way of the Piraeus and of Zug, the trim, Swiss lakeside town where Marc Rich had his headquarters. Bill Clinton is idolised by millions of African Americans. Would they be quite so keen on him if they knew he had used his pardon power to help a man who had made large amounts of money by breaking the embargo, imposed by the sub-Saharan African countries and their Arab allies, on South Africa? Until the fall of the Shah in 1979 the South Africans could get some oil from Iran. After he fell, they were in serious trouble. According to an American academic study, Sasol, the South African state oil company, turned to two men to save its supplies. One was a Dutchman, John Deuss, who until 1977 had been trading in Soviet oil. Within the year, Deuss found 18m tons of oil, most of it from Saudi Arabia. As early as April 1979 Marc Rich had negotiated an initial contract to deliver 50m barrels of oil to South Africa. The oil, delivered through a company called Minoil, came from many sources, among them Brunei. But after mid-1981 Royal Dutch Shell, not wanting to incur the bad publicity and government pressure that could come from continuing to break the embargo, broke up its partnership with the government of Brunei. Marc Rich stepped in and arranged deliveries from Brunei himself. Rich's activities and already brought him into odd company. In 1979, in the biggest casualty ever up to that time in terms of tonnage lost, the Atlantic Empress, of 292,000 tons dead weight, collided with the Aegean Captain, of 210,000 dwt, off Tobago in a storm. The Aegean Captain is believed to have been loaded with bootleg oil for South Africa, and to have been under charter to Rich or one of his companies at the time. M ore bizarre was the fate of the Salem, a supertanker which secretly unloaded 192,000 tons of oil in Durban as part of an elaborate conspiracy involving representatives of the South African government and a number of businessmen. On January 17 1980 the Salem sank in one of the deepest trenches in the Atlantic off the coast of Guinea. The mere chance that brought a BP tanker to the scene and found the crew sitting with their duty frees in the lifeboats, led to the revelation that the Salem had been scuttled. Both the ship and the oil that had been unloaded at Durban had been heavily insured at Lloyd's. The scuttling and insurance scam, presumably, was an elaboration of the basic plan, to use Salem to deliver oil to South Africa through the embargo. But telephone transcripts showed that the delivery of the oil at Durban was reported to the Salem's owner and a confederate in, of all places, Zug, where the owner had business connections. The Salem's skipper, a certain Dimitrios, or \"Jimmy\", Georgoulis, is said to have practised driving a supertanker on another ship, the Albahaa B, which was also to have been used to deliver oil to South Africa, but blew up, allegedly as a result of incompetent cleaning of her tanks. The owner of the Albahaa B subsequently lost his life in a mysterious plane crash over the Sudan desert. There were rumours at the time that his plane had been shot down by the Libyan air force. The great operation to get oil to the South Africans through the embargo is still surrounded by mystery, rumour, secrecy, even paranoia. But what is certain is that Marc Rich was up to his ears in it. Very probably, he built up his contacts in the oil shipping world, and in particular his acquaintance among those who were prepared to take a risk to life or reputation to make very considerable amounts of money, to his earlier experience of running the oil embargo of Israel. Whatever Rich's precise involvement in the wilder shores of sanctions busting, there is no doubt at all that he was at the heart of the conspiracy to help the South Africans.

      "body": "<p>When John Kamara walked out of the appeal court last March he had six clear plastic prison bags full of his belongings, a \u00a346 discharge grant and a travel warrant that expired at 8pm that night.</p> <p>A victim of a miscarriage of justice who had been in prison for the previous 20 years, he was surprised by the swiftness of the overturning of his conviction and was unprepared for life on the outside.</p> <p>With no support from any official agencies, Mr Kamara, from Toxteth, Liverpool, was bundled into a taxi to the north London home of Paddy Hill, one of the Birmingham Six.</p> <p>Over the years since his release, Mr Hill has taken in a number of victims of miscarriages of justice because they had nowhere else to go. Only too aware of the problems his fellow \"miscarriages\" face, his is often an open door.</p> <p>Today marks the 10th anniversary of the release of Mr Hill and the other members of the Birmingham Six. It also sees the official launch of the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (Mojo) at the House of Commons. Founded by Mr Hill, Mojo will campaign for some kind of aftercare for people like Mr Kamara who are left on their own, in spite of years of institutionalisation.</p> <p>\"Innocent people are being dumped out of the court of appeal like sacks of garbage, all suffering from severe post-traumatic stress syndrome, without counselling or any psychological help,\" says the group's literature.</p> <p>There is little in the way of help for those who have been victims of miscarriages of justice and are then sucked up by the potential vacuum that is life outside. In 1998 the home secretary, Jack Straw, rejected a call from Chris Mullin, the former chairman of the home affairs select committee, for special measures to assist in the care of released miscarriage of justice victims.</p> <p>Many who have worked with victims have observed that they are profoundly scarred by their experiences and have difficulty in coping with life on the outside.</p> <p>Adrian Grounds, a psychiatrist at the institute of criminology at Cambridge, examined Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four and four members of the Birmingham Six and found that they were suffering from irreversible, persistent and disabling post-traumatic stress syndrome. He compared their mental state with that of brain damaged accident victims or people who had suffered war crimes.</p> <p>Gareth Peirce, the solicitor who represented the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six defendants, said: \"They come out with no money and no counselling. They have no references, it is difficult to open a bank account, you can't get a mortgage. They have no GP. You don't belong.\"</p> <p>Judith Ward, wrongly convicted of the M62 coach bombing, was refused a \u00a35,000 bank loan while she waited for an interim compensation payment and Michael Hickey, one of the freed Bridgewater Three, told a court he had stolen a ring from a Birmingham jewellers to highlight his case. He said: \"I did it to say I've been given no money, nowhere to live, what am I supposed to do?\"</p> <p>Mr Hill has been travelling across the country, garnering support for his fledgling group. He said: \"Compare what is available for innocent people as compared to guilty people and see what is done for them. When someone makes a decision for a guilty person to be released there is a chain of processes put in place which lasts for about three years. They take them out for a few hours at the weekend. Over a period of a few months those few hours gradually increase. Then they will be out all day and come back at night. They teach them all about modern technology. They are rehabilitated into the system. When they are released they have a place to live, probation services, aftercare services, all sorts of helplines.</p> <p>\"The innocent. One day your ass is sitting in a prison cell and the next day you are in the court of appeal. You are thrown out on the street like a sack of garbage and forgotten about. It's mind boggling coming out. Even in the queue for the supermarket you get wound up with all the computer stuff and credit cards.\"</p> <p>Mr Hill said many either become alcoholic or addicted to drugs as a way of blocking severe psychological problems. For most, it is difficult to even sign on with a doctor because they have no paperwork.</p> <p>Another \"miscarriage\" to take temporary residence at Mr Hill's home was Paddy Nicholls, who had been in prison for 23 years after being wrongfully convicted of murdering a friend. He was almost 70 when he was released in 1998.</p> <p>\"Paddy had had a stroke at Christmas and was released on bail in the February. They just threw him out. That's a man who was 70 years of age and could hardly walk. They threw him out at the gates of Albany prison. I had to go and pick him up. He had no medication, nothing, and on the way out they even took the tennis ball that they give to stroke victims off him,\" Mr Hill said.</p> <p>A year after his release, Mr Kamara still struggles to negotiate this world, though he has found himself a fianc\u00e9e and a place to live. Mr Kamara had been convicted of the murder of a betting shop manager in Liverpool but it later emerged that the prosecution failed to disclose 201 witness statements taken by Merseyside police to the defence lawyers at the original trial.</p> <p>Mr Kamara said: \"One minute I was sitting with a life sentence and the next minute I was free to go, but go where?

      "bodyText": "When John Kamara walked out of the appeal court last March he had six clear plastic prison bags full of his belongings, a \u00a346 discharge grant and a travel warrant that expired at 8pm that night. A victim of a miscarriage of justice who had been in prison for the previous 20 years, he was surprised by the swiftness of the overturning of his conviction and was unprepared for life on the outside. With no support from any official agencies, Mr Kamara, from Toxteth, Liverpool, was bundled into a taxi to the north London home of Paddy Hill, one of the Birmingham Six. Over the years since his release, Mr Hill has taken in a number of victims of miscarriages of justice because they had nowhere else to go. Only too aware of the problems his fellow \"miscarriages\" face, his is often an open door. Today marks the 10th anniversary of the release of Mr Hill and the other members of the Birmingham Six. It also sees the official launch of the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation (Mojo) at the House of Commons. Founded by Mr Hill, Mojo will campaign for some kind of aftercare for people like Mr Kamara who are left on their own, in spite of years of institutionalisation. \"Innocent people are being dumped out of the court of appeal like sacks of garbage, all suffering from severe post-traumatic stress syndrome, without counselling or any psychological help,\" says the group's literature. There is little in the way of help for those who have been victims of miscarriages of justice and are then sucked up by the potential vacuum that is life outside. In 1998 the home secretary, Jack Straw, rejected a call from Chris Mullin, the former chairman of the home affairs select committee, for special measures to assist in the care of released miscarriage of justice victims. Many who have worked with victims have observed that they are profoundly scarred by their experiences and have difficulty in coping with life on the outside. Adrian Grounds, a psychiatrist at the institute of criminology at Cambridge, examined Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four and four members of the Birmingham Six and found that they were suffering from irreversible, persistent and disabling post-traumatic stress syndrome. He compared their mental state with that of brain damaged accident victims or people who had suffered war crimes. Gareth Peirce, the solicitor who represented the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six defendants, said: \"They come out with no money and no counselling. They have no references, it is difficult to open a bank account, you can't get a mortgage. They have no GP. You don't belong.\" Judith Ward, wrongly convicted of the M62 coach bombing, was refused a \u00a35,000 bank loan while she waited for an interim compensation payment and Michael Hickey, one of the freed Bridgewater Three, told a court he had stolen a ring from a Birmingham jewellers to highlight his case. He said: \"I did it to say I've been given no money, nowhere to live, what am I supposed to do?\" Mr Hill has been travelling across the country, garnering support for his fledgling group. He said: \"Compare what is available for innocent people as compared to guilty people and see what is done for them. When someone makes a decision for a guilty person to be released there is a chain of processes put in place which lasts for about three years. They take them out for a few hours at the weekend. Over a period of a few months those few hours gradually increase. Then they will be out all day and come back at night. They teach them all about modern technology. They are rehabilitated into the system. When they are released they have a place to live, probation services, aftercare services, all sorts of helplines. \"The innocent. One day your ass is sitting in a prison cell and the next day you are in the court of appeal. You are thrown out on the street like a sack of garbage and forgotten about. It's mind boggling coming out. Even in the queue for the supermarket you get wound up with all the computer stuff and credit cards.\" Mr Hill said many either become alcoholic or addicted to drugs as a way of blocking severe psychological problems. For most, it is difficult to even sign on with a doctor because they have no paperwork. Another \"miscarriage\" to take temporary residence at Mr Hill's home was Paddy Nicholls, who had been in prison for 23 years after being wrongfully convicted of murdering a friend. He was almost 70 when he was released in 1998. \"Paddy had had a stroke at Christmas and was released on bail in the February. They just threw him out. That's a man who was 70 years of age and could hardly walk. They threw him out at the gates of Albany prison. I had to go and pick him up. He had no medication, nothing, and on the way out they even took the tennis ball that they give to stroke victims off him,\" Mr Hill said. A year after his release, Mr Kamara still struggles to negotiate this world, though he has found himself a fianc\u00e9e and a place to live. Mr Kamara had been convicted of the murder of a betting shop manager in Liverpool but it later emerged that the prosecution failed to disclose 201 witness statements taken by Merseyside police to the defence lawyers at the original trial. Mr Kamara said: \"One minute I was sitting with a life sentence and the next minute I was free to go, but go where? I was given a travel warrant to Liverpool that expired at 8pm. I had no money for six to seven weeks. I had no legal documentation, no identity, you are a non person. The DSS granted me an emergency loan of \u00a35 which I had to pay back within 28 days. I told them to keep it. \"The housing manager said because I was a miscarriage of justice why didn't I get a loan and buy myself a property because, he said 'you are going to get massive compensation'. That's how bad it is. Sometimes I thought 'fucking hell, it looks like I'll have to get arrested to get probation'. They seem to push you. They want you to commit a crime.\" Six waiting for redress The Birmingham Six were arrested after the bombing of the Mulberry Bush bar in the city on 1974, in which 21 died. All six were released in 1991 after the case against them was overturned. They had served 16 years: \u0095 Paddy Hill Founder of Miscarriages of Justice organisation. Lives in north London, has difficulty coping with everyday life \u0095 Billy Power Lives in east London with wife Nora. Works at homeless hostel. Struggles with everyday life and has had problems bonding with his children \u0095 John Walker Remarried with a young son, Marty.

The Home Office faces a barrage of compensation claims after the high court ruled in 1999 that prosecutions of asylum seekers for using false papers breached Britain's obligations under the 1951 Geneva convention on the status of refugees. The court delivered a strong rebuke at the time to the home secretary, Jack Straw, and the crown prosecution service. Lord Justice Simon Brown said no one in the criminal justice system had given \"the least thought\" to article 31 of the convention, which states that asylum seekers should not be penalised for entering a country illegally. As a result, he said, many were in prison who should not be there. The married couple, who each received \u00a340,000, have asked not to be identified.

This week's \"resignation\" by Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori (he said he was standing down as president of the Liberal Democratic party, the LDP, which in Japanese terms means the premiership), is only the latest instalment - and the names being put forward as contenders for the succession do not signal much change.</p> <p>Finance ministers usually speak in a kind of code where unpalatable truths are disguised in soothing language so as not to frighten the markets, but Kiichi Miyazawa has now put on record that Japanese finances are in a catastrophic state.

This was no ordinary president of Harvard, either, but Larry Summers, who until the middle of January was treasury secretary of the United States and rated as one of the most brilliant economists of his generation. </p> <p>Mr Summers has thought a lot about Japan, regularly lecturing hapless Japanese officials at international gatherings about their failure to take the measures necessary to restore health to Asia's first and most successful tiger economy. Now he is out of political office he can afford to posit a frightening scenario: that America could become the new Japan. </p> <p><strong> Speculative bubbles</strong><br> </p> <p>On the face of it, this seems laughable. The US economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace, after its longest period of expansion since records began in the 1850s.

Academics often say controversial things just to be noticed. These are not normal times, with Wall Street gripped by a severe bear market and yesterday's darlings - the dot.coms - going bust in droves. This was no ordinary president of Harvard, either, but Larry Summers, who until the middle of January was treasury secretary of the United States and rated as one of the most brilliant economists of his generation. Mr Summers has thought a lot about Japan, regularly lecturing hapless Japanese officials at international gatherings about their failure to take the measures necessary to restore health to Asia's first and most successful tiger economy. Now he is out of political office he can afford to posit a frightening scenario: that America could become the new Japan. Speculative bubbles On the face of it, this seems laughable. The US economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace, after its longest period of expansion since records began in the 1850s. Unemployment is historically low and American companies are world leaders in the new technologies. The same could have been said of Japan at the end of the 1980s, when the country was enjoying full employment, had been growing strongly since the end of the second world war and boasted many of the world's biggest companies.

      "bodyText": "Cheltenham are confident that they will be in a position today to make a decision regarding the rescheduled Festival meeting, which should have started yesterday. The choice for the three-day gathering rests between April 17-19 or April 24-26. However, the preferred option for the last week in April would precipitate a direct clash with Punchestown if the Irish government allows that meeting to go ahead. The other three-day slot brings with it its own set of logistical complications as it comes in Easter week and pits Cheltenham against the Craven meeting at Newmarket. Edward Gillespie, the managing director at Cheltenham, said yesterday: \"The whole thing keeps swinging one way and then the other. \"There have been three outbreaks in Gloucestershire, but a suspected outbreak in Northern Ireland has not been confirmed. At one time it looked like we would be in a position to make an announcement tonight, but now it will probably be tomorrow. \"As it stands, there will be a Festival on one of those two weeks. We intend to have all the 20 races. \"The idea of perhaps just having the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup was something that would have only been considered a long way down the line. I would say that as long as Cheltenham doesn't fall within an exclusion zone or racing is completely banned there will be a Festival this year.\" There might be a Festival, but there will not be much of an ante-post market after the decision of the major bookmakers to refund all ante-post bets on the Cheltenham Festival was given the approval of the Tattersalls Committee. There had been criticism of the decision in some quarters as the races concerned could still be staged at a postponed Festival next month. However, the organisation agreed that all such bets should be void as the races have been reopened. A statement from the Tattersalls Committee said: \"Tattersalls Committee announce that all ante-post bets for the cancelled Cheltenham meeting are void as covered by their existing Rule 4A (3). The rule voids such bets if the 'conditions' of the race entry are changed prior to the horses coming under starter's orders.\" Racing is still a long way from coming under starter's orders as regularly as usual and now one of the additional fixtures, scheduled to make up for the shortfall, has also been cancelled. Officials at Ayr have announced that their additional meeting on Monday has been abandoned. Chris Kennedy, Ayr's marketing manager, said: \"In view of the foot and mouth outbreak, the committee has taken the decision not to race.\" Saturday's Winter Derby meeting at Lingfield, and the day's other programme at Market Rasen, are still on track.

      "bodyText": "The environmental risks from contamination by depleted uranium ammunition used in the war in Kosovo are insignificant, a United Nations report concluded yesterday, but its authors also said that they remained unsure about the long-term health consequences of DU. The UN Environment Programme's (UNEP) final report on the environmental impact of DU after the Kosovo conflict in 1999 recommended a clean-up of the 112 exposed sites there, which still appears not to have been carried out despite preliminary warnings issued two months ago. Radioactive and toxic contamination to passers-by was rated as \"insignificant to non-existent\" following tests based on samples gathered from 11 of the sites last November; this finding, however, did not include the cases in which people had had direct contact with the fragments or ingested the particles. At five sites, UN inspectors found virtually intact DU penetrators, the bullet-shaped core and tip of the shell, which had survived explosions because of soft soil. The report also called for an extensive examination of sites in Bosnia, where about three tonnes of DU ordnance used during Nato attacks is thought to have remained untouched for five years, \"to reduce scientific uncertainty on the impact of DU on the environment, particularly over time\". \"There are still considerable scientific uncertainties, especially related to the safety of groundwater in the long term,\" Pekka Haavisto, the Finnish head of the investigative team, said. Samples had established, however, that drinking water was safe so far. Most of the recent science on the behaviour and dangers of DU has been based on natural uranium, but the scientists from five European radiological laboratories on the team found evidence that pieces of DU were more liable to disperse into the soil and to become soluble. Mr Haavisto said reported cases of leukaemia and other illnesses among western troops in the region were low and could not be linked directly to DU. \"Then we come to the crucial question: Are there some other sources, other risks, which we don't know about? We know that some of those servicemen have also been to Bosnia-Herzegovina.\" While traces of plutonium were found around the sites, it said the amounts were so small that they were less of a hazard than the uranium.

      "bodyText": "The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, will try when he meets industry chiefs today to end an embarrassing deadlock over a national plan to compensate Nazi-era slave workers. One million former slave labourers, mainly from central and eastern Europe, who were drafted in by the Nazis to provide a wartime workforce have waited for years to be compensated. But the programme, which calls for a DM5bn (about \u00a31.6bn) contribution from industry to be matched by the government, is in utter confusion. There are major delays in paying out the compensation, because industry chiefs insist on receiving immunity from prosecution from future lawsuits for the payout. Last week New York judge Shirley Wohl Kram refused to throw out a key court case against German banks in case the compensation fund fails to deliver the money. Mr Schr\u00f6der has intervened in the standoff following stiff criticism from Jewish groups and lawyers who claim that the German industry heads are deliberately dragging their feet, sending damaging signals to the rest of the world about the country's willingness to face up to its past. Embarrassed by the deadlock, the inhabitants of a north German village have taken it upon themselves to compensate one Polish victim. The villagers of Gr\u00f6dersby held a whip-round and delivered the DM2,000 proceeds this week to Henryk Baran, 72, who was forced to work in the village by the Nazi regime. Local newspapers in Poland reported that Mr Baran was speechless as he was handed 20 crisp DM100 notes, brought to him in his small prefabricated apartment in Krotoszyn, in western Poland, by two of Gr\u00f6dersby's residents. \"I'm very moved that there are young people who have not forgotten the children who were deported to the Third Reich to work,\" he told a local paper. \"This money was collected by the children and grandchildren of the people who carried out these crimes but are now dead.\" Mr Baran is one of around 500,000 Polish victims forced to labour for the Nazis. He was put to work at Gr\u00f6dersby's dairy in 1944, when he was 15, and liberated by British troops the following year. \"The constant delays in compensating the slave labourers have really annoyed us, and we wanted to act,\" Gr\u00f6dersby resident G\u00fcnther Pl\u00e4nitz said. \"This was about trying to breakthrough the passivity.\" The Polish-German Recon ciliation Foundation also began issuing payments of 1,400 zlotys (\u00a3240) to 5,000 of the oldest victims this week. The foundation said it expected to be reimbursed by the German fund later, but said the situation was getting critical as dozens of the victims are dying every day. More than 40,000 other victims over the age of 80 are due to receive cheques by post in the next two weeks, Mateusz Chachaj, the foundation's spokesman, said. He said he had faith in the German industry bosses to reach an agreement. \"I'm optimistic that German industry will meet the shortfall in its own time, and out of a sense of moral responsibility,\" he said yesterday in Munich. About DM1.4bn has yet to be paid into the fund. Jewish leaders, lawyers and compensation organisations have accused German industry of deliberately causing the hold-up to keep the money for as long as possible. Pressure is building on Mr Schr\u00f6der to reach an agreement before he visits Washington at the end March for talks with President George Bush. A group of North American rabbis who travelled to Berlin yesterday pushed for a change in the fund law to allow for immediate payments.",

Peruvian prosecutors are investigating whether the former president, Alberto Fujimori - who took great pride in personally directing the operation to rescue 72 hostages after a four-month siege - should be tried for human rights violations and murder. Peru's former leader fled the country last year to live in Japan after a vote-buying scandal. This month a Peruvian judge ordered Mr Fujimori to appear in court on charges of dereliction of duty, although Japan and Peru have no extradition treaty. On Monday five graves under unmarked crosses were unearthed on the shanty town outskirts of Lima, as Marxist sympathisers shouted \"Spilt blood will never be forgotten!\". Forensic experts are now examining the rebels' bodies to see if there is evidence of gunshot wounds at close range, which would indicate that they were not shot in self-defence or in combat. The postmortems are expected to take 10 to 15 days. \"There are ...sufficient indications that on the day of the retaking of the ambassador's residence by members of the armed forces, three rebels were taken alive,\" said Ronald Gamarra, a state human rights prosecutor. \"Apparently, a commando proceeded to execute them when they were in custody.\" The siege started during a VIP party. The hostages were held by the 14 members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement for 126 days. All the hostage-takers died in the rescue, as well as one hostage and two soldiers. In January relatives of the slain guerrillas filed a criminal complaint accusing Mr Fujimori, his fugitive ex-intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos, and former military chief Gen Nicolas Hermosa of human rights violations and extra-judicial murder. The complaints were filed after Hidetaka Ogura, a Japanese embassy employee who was held hostage, told Peruvian radio last December that he had seen three rebels captured alive during the raid. Four years ago, local media reported that when Peruvian special forces stormed the mansion, two young female rebels tried to give up, yelling \"We surrender, we surrender!\" before being cut down by commando gunfire. \"I want to know the truth. I don't believe anything that Fujimori has said,\" said Maria Fernandez, 54, the mother of one of the dead guerrillas.

      "bodyText": "Israel could have a key agreement with the European Union suspended if it does not end human rights abuses and blockades of Palestinian areas in the West Bank and Gaza. In their first practical response to the Middle East crisis, EU governments are considering punitive measures to underline that the policies of the new Likud prime minister, Ariel Sharon, are not acceptable, the Guardian has learned. Robin Cook and fellow EU foreign ministers are to review options next Monday after Chris Patten, the commissioner for external relations, warned Israeli leaders yesterday that their economic stranglehold must be lifted. \"It does not seem to us that everything that is being done in the West Bank and Gaza can be justified in security terms,\" Mr Patten said during a visit to the area with Anna Lindh, the foreign minister of Sweden, the current holder of the EU's rotating presidency. France is leading calls for tough diplomatic action against Israel, seeking to boost the EU's role in a region traditionally dominated by the US at a time when the new Bush administration has not made its policies clear. In a strongly worded paper on the Middle East submitted to EU governments last month, the French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, argued: \"Europeans have shrunk from making the effort needed to overcome their contradictions and apprehensions [and] are not prepared to pay the political price of a genuine role, and have become accustomed to their role as bit players. \"The EU should make the US recognise that it is legitimate for Europe to take its own approach to peace. If the union really wishes to pay a role, it must escape from the situation where defining a common position comes down to seeking the lowest common denominator in platitudinous declarations or ritualised diplomatic tours.\" The EU could decide to suspend all or part of its 1995 association agreement with Israel - which includes high level political dialogue, cooperation in several key areas and valuable trade preferences worth millions of pounds a year - with immediate effect. Britain and Germany would be unlikely to favour such action but France would have the backing of Spain and Greece. EU diplomats said last night that other less drastic measures under consideration included suspension of cooperation with Israel in the areas of science and technology or agricultural liberalisation talks. The EU-Israel agreement was only ratified last year after the previous Likud prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was replaced by the Labour leader, Ehud Barak, who was in turn defeated by the hardline Mr Sharon last month. Israel bowed to its critics yesterday by easing its blockade of cities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Two roads to the West Bank town of Ramallah were reopened. But the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said the changes were cosmetic and aimed \"at deceiving the world that the closure has been lifted\". Washington warned Israel on Monday that if the economic pressure brought about a collapse of the Palestinian Authority, then it would harm prospects for peace. The Israeli army sealed off the West Bank and Gaza when the intifada erupted, blocking more than 100,000 workers from jobs in Israel that are the lifeline of the economy. Since then, the army has intensified its stranglehold on Palestinian cities, sealing off roads with concrete blocks and mounds of earth, positioning armoured personnel carriers at the entrances to towns and, in the last few weeks, digging an 11-mile waterless moat around the desert town of Jericho. Mr Patten said the EU urged Mr Sharon to transfer \u00a336m in tax revenues it has withheld from the Palestinian administration. He said the siege, which has cost the Palestinian economy at least \u00a31bn and driven up unemployment, was counter-productive. \"If the economy continues to deteriorate in the West Bank and Gaza and if more people lose their jobs, if the Palestinian administration is undermined as a potential centre of authority, it will be more difficult to deal with security issues,\" Mr Patten said. In his visit to the Gaza Strip on Monday, Mr Patten also issued a warning to Yasser Arafat, saying the EU did not want to continue its financial bail-out unless the Palestinian leader ended corruption and imposed some order on the Palestinian Authority.",

When Eckstine broke up the band, Turney returned to Ohio, before \"scuffing\" mainly in New York, the only highlight being an extended gig in Philadelphia with veteran guitarist Elmer Snowden, one of Ellington's earliest mentors.

He went on to win the 1970 and 1971 Down Beat critics' poll, and created an exciting solo identity on Ellington albums and in concert appearances around the world. He persuaded Duke to allow him to contribute original compositions to the orchestra's repertoire, including Checkered Hat, a tribute to Hodges.</p> <p>Oddly, Ellington rewarded Turney's versatility by making him uncomfortable on the bandstand, doubling up the tempo on a solo feature so that Turney found it impossible to play.

      "body": "<p>Susan Gow, who has died from a brain tumour aged 53, was a stalwart - and, in the wider world, unsung - member of Harold Wilson's staff at 10 Downing Street in the 1960s. She was also a convinced European and among the first wave of Britons to join the European Commission staff in Brussels.</p> <p>After leaving school at 16, her first job was with the Parliamentary Labour party at the House of Commons. She moved to Downing Street soon after Labour's election victory in October 1964 to work for Wilson's political secretary, Marcia Williams, now Lady Falkender. Thus, in her late teenage years, Susan Lewis, as she then was, stayed late in the evenings providing administrative support and friendship to Williams and the rest of Wilson's kitchen cabinet.</p> <p>Susan's family lived in Tite Street, Chelsea. Her father, Bert, was head waiter at the Caf\u00e9 Royal and her mother, Betty, held a key role, responsible for membership, at Labour party headquarters. Indeed, Susan was almost born into the party. Certainly, she remained loyal to it, stoutly defending its record, and what it stood for, as others showered criticism on it during the lean, divisive times of the 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>She also believed that Wilson had received an unfair press - a view borne out by recent releases from the Public Record Office over, for example, his principled stand against apartheid.</p> <p>Her unyielding loyalty was reflected during the personal recriminations - many directed at Marcia Williams - after Labour lost power in 1970. Despite repeated attempts by journalists, some of them her personal friends, to cajole, even bribe, her to spill the beans, she resolutely refused to do so - in stark contrast to other members of Wilson's entourage.</p> <p>Between 1970 and 1973, Susan took on a number of jobs, including a spell in Paris, where she worked for a travel firm which took her to Romania and Bulgaria, and as personal assistant to Richard Crossman, then editor of the New Statesman.</p> <p>When Britain joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, she was in the vanguard, serving in the cabinet of George (now Lord) Thomson, the former Labour foreign office minister who had been appointed as one of the UK's first two European commissioners. She later joined the staff of Agenor, a leftwing magazine devoted to closer pan-European cooperation.</p> <p>In Brussels, she met Carl Wilms-Wright, but the marriage lasted only about two years. Later, in 1980, she married David Gow, then the Scotsman's European correspondent. Back in London, where David had joined the Guardian, Susan took on a number of jobs, including campaigning for third-world rights with the World Development Movement, before working for Joan Lestor, Labour's aid and development spokeswoman.</p> <p>For what were to become the last years of her life, the family moved to south Wales, where she had difficulty in finding a job to fulfil her interests and talents, although she finally took on work for the Welsh national assembly.</p> <p>Susan was extremely modest, always asking about others. She will be remembered for her extraordinary generosity and selflessness. She is survived by her husband David, the Guardian's industrial editor, their adopted daughter Gemma, and granddaughter Nicole.</p> <p>Susan Jane Gow, researcher and political activist, born May 26 1947; died March 8 2001.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Susan Gow, who has died from a brain tumour aged 53, was a stalwart - and, in the wider world, unsung - member of Harold Wilson's staff at 10 Downing Street in the 1960s. She was also a convinced European and among the first wave of Britons to join the European Commission staff in Brussels. After leaving school at 16, her first job was with the Parliamentary Labour party at the House of Commons. She moved to Downing Street soon after Labour's election victory in October 1964 to work for Wilson's political secretary, Marcia Williams, now Lady Falkender. Thus, in her late teenage years, Susan Lewis, as she then was, stayed late in the evenings providing administrative support and friendship to Williams and the rest of Wilson's kitchen cabinet. Susan's family lived in Tite Street, Chelsea. Her father, Bert, was head waiter at the Caf\u00e9 Royal and her mother, Betty, held a key role, responsible for membership, at Labour party headquarters. Indeed, Susan was almost born into the party. Certainly, she remained loyal to it, stoutly defending its record, and what it stood for, as others showered criticism on it during the lean, divisive times of the 1980s and early 1990s. She also believed that Wilson had received an unfair press - a view borne out by recent releases from the Public Record Office over, for example, his principled stand against apartheid. Her unyielding loyalty was reflected during the personal recriminations - many directed at Marcia Williams - after Labour lost power in 1970. Despite repeated attempts by journalists, some of them her personal friends, to cajole, even bribe, her to spill the beans, she resolutely refused to do so - in stark contrast to other members of Wilson's entourage. Between 1970 and 1973, Susan took on a number of jobs, including a spell in Paris, where she worked for a travel firm which took her to Romania and Bulgaria, and as personal assistant to Richard Crossman, then editor of the New Statesman. When Britain joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, she was in the vanguard, serving in the cabinet of George (now Lord) Thomson, the former Labour foreign office minister who had been appointed as one of the UK's first two European commissioners. She later joined the staff of Agenor, a leftwing magazine devoted to closer pan-European cooperation. In Brussels, she met Carl Wilms-Wright, but the marriage lasted only about two years. Later, in 1980, she married David Gow, then the Scotsman's European correspondent. Back in London, where David had joined the Guardian, Susan took on a number of jobs, including campaigning for third-world rights with the World Development Movement, before working for Joan Lestor, Labour's aid and development spokeswoman. For what were to become the last years of her life, the family moved to south Wales, where she had difficulty in finding a job to fulfil her interests and talents, although she finally took on work for the Welsh national assembly. Susan was extremely modest, always asking about others. She will be remembered for her extraordinary generosity and selflessness. She is survived by her husband David, the Guardian's industrial editor, their adopted daughter Gemma, and granddaughter Nicole. Susan Jane Gow, researcher and political activist, born May 26 1947; died March 8 2001.",

      "body": "<p>A new row over boardroom pay is likely after it emerged that one of the Royal Bank of Scotland's top executives, Larry Fish, was paid $22m (\u00a315m) last year. </p> <p>The pay award made to Mr Fish, an American, under a seven-year performance plan, was just one of the bumper payments to senior directors of the Edinburgh-based bank. </p> <p>Fred Goodwin, the chief executive, was paid \u00a32.2m including a\"special bonus\" of \u00a3814,000 for his efforts in the takeover battle for NatWest last year. His predecessor, Sir George Mathewson, who is to become non-executive chairman next month, received \u00a32.2m including a \u00a3759,000 special bonus. Sir George also made a \u00a31.8m gain on stock options. </p> <p>The payments are for the 15 months to the end of December 2000 - rather than the more traditional 12 months - because of a change to the bank's reporting period. It is the special bonuses to directors, which the bank announced last September, that could cause difficulties with shareholders. The bank's gauge of its performance, which does not include a measurement against its peers, may also rankle with some shareholders. </p> <p>Peter Montagnon, head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, has yet to receive the remuneration report, but said: \"In principle, the position of the ABI is to reward performance which has been demonstrably attained. That means we prefer the benefit to accrue when it is clear the takeover has been successful. A year is not a very long time.\" </p> <p>Viscount Younger of Leckie, the bank's chairman, defended the pay of Mr Fish, who runs Citizen's Bank from Boston. \"Without question Larry Fish is a top performer and over the last seven years has done a magnificent job building Citizen's into a powerful financial services group within New England. Larry's remuneration is on a par with peers in the US. The Royal Bank of Scotland has never been afraid to pay for excellent performance,\" said Viscount Younger, who himself was paid \u00a3379,000. </p> <p>Other directors to receive special bonuses were Iain Robertson, who runs the corporate banking arm and was paid a total of \u00a32m before a \u00a31.4m gain on stock options. Norman McLuskie, who runs the retail operation, took home \u00a3839,000, excluding a \u00a32.3m options gain. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Our remuneration structure is performance based and reflects a period during which the bank's share price has been a top performer in Europe. We concluded the largest takeover in UK banking history exceeded all targets for delivering merger benefits, established the group as the seventh largest company in the UK and the number three bank in Europe.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new row over boardroom pay is likely after it emerged that one of the Royal Bank of Scotland's top executives, Larry Fish, was paid $22m (\u00a315m) last year. The pay award made to Mr Fish, an American, under a seven-year performance plan, was just one of the bumper payments to senior directors of the Edinburgh-based bank. Fred Goodwin, the chief executive, was paid \u00a32.2m including a\"special bonus\" of \u00a3814,000 for his efforts in the takeover battle for NatWest last year. His predecessor, Sir George Mathewson, who is to become non-executive chairman next month, received \u00a32.2m including a \u00a3759,000 special bonus. Sir George also made a \u00a31.8m gain on stock options. The payments are for the 15 months to the end of December 2000 - rather than the more traditional 12 months - because of a change to the bank's reporting period. It is the special bonuses to directors, which the bank announced last September, that could cause difficulties with shareholders. The bank's gauge of its performance, which does not include a measurement against its peers, may also rankle with some shareholders. Peter Montagnon, head of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, has yet to receive the remuneration report, but said: \"In principle, the position of the ABI is to reward performance which has been demonstrably attained. That means we prefer the benefit to accrue when it is clear the takeover has been successful. A year is not a very long time.\" Viscount Younger of Leckie, the bank's chairman, defended the pay of Mr Fish, who runs Citizen's Bank from Boston. \"Without question Larry Fish is a top performer and over the last seven years has done a magnificent job building Citizen's into a powerful financial services group within New England. Larry's remuneration is on a par with peers in the US. The Royal Bank of Scotland has never been afraid to pay for excellent performance,\" said Viscount Younger, who himself was paid \u00a3379,000. Other directors to receive special bonuses were Iain Robertson, who runs the corporate banking arm and was paid a total of \u00a32m before a \u00a31.4m gain on stock options. Norman McLuskie, who runs the retail operation, took home \u00a3839,000, excluding a \u00a32.3m options gain. A spokesman said: \"Our remuneration structure is performance based and reflects a period during which the bank's share price has been a top performer in Europe. We concluded the largest takeover in UK banking history exceeded all targets for delivering merger benefits, established the group as the seventh largest company in the UK and the number three bank in Europe.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is not Keith Vaz who is disgraced but the media for hounding a good man with lies and distortions.</p> <p>Even the Guardian (Leader, March 13) misrepresents the report of the committee on standards and privileges which cleared Mr Vaz of all but one of 18 allegations. It is untrue that the committee could not rule on eight allegations \"because Mr Vaz had refused to give them the information they needed\". After the commissioner reported to the committee, leaving eight inquiries uncompleted, the committee interviewed Mr Vaz twice, as well as several other witnesses. Mr Vaz provided the committee with all relevant information available to him and the committee rejected all the allegations left uncompleted by the commissioner.</p> <p>Instead of applauding his welcome exoneration the media has largely focused on his supposed \"obstruction\" of the commissioner's investigation. The committee nowhere uses this expression. It concluded merely that if Mr Vaz and other witnesses had answered the commissioner's questions fully and promptly she would have been able to complete her report in a much shorter time. The committee also said that Mr Vaz was wrong to tell the commissioner in December - eight months after the investigation started - that he would not answer further questions from her.</p> <p>Mr Vaz had answered a very large number of questions by the commissioner since the investigation started in February last year. On June 7 the commissioner wrote to me, as his solicitor, as follows: \"...Mr Vaz has been helpful in discussing these matters and in providing me with written replies and information and you are correct in saying that Mr Vaz has already responded to all the allegations other than informing me whether he had recommended Mr Zaiwalla for an honour. I am glad to receive now the response from Mr Vaz that he recommended Mr Zaiwalla for an honour...\" The delay in responding on the last point was caused simply by Mr Vaz having punctiliously sought advice from the Speaker as to whether he could properly disclose so confidential a matter.</p> <p>When the investigation had dragged on until December Mr Vaz informed the commissioner through me that he believed he had already answered all relevant questions but would be happy to answer any questions which the committee wished him to answer - as he subsequently did. If he was wrong to invite referral to the committee after eight months it was hardly a grievous error. <br><b>Geoffrey Bindman</b> <br>Bindman &amp; Partners</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is not Keith Vaz who is disgraced but the media for hounding a good man with lies and distortions. Even the Guardian (Leader, March 13) misrepresents the report of the committee on standards and privileges which cleared Mr Vaz of all but one of 18 allegations. It is untrue that the committee could not rule on eight allegations \"because Mr Vaz had refused to give them the information they needed\". After the commissioner reported to the committee, leaving eight inquiries uncompleted, the committee interviewed Mr Vaz twice, as well as several other witnesses. Mr Vaz provided the committee with all relevant information available to him and the committee rejected all the allegations left uncompleted by the commissioner. Instead of applauding his welcome exoneration the media has largely focused on his supposed \"obstruction\" of the commissioner's investigation. The committee nowhere uses this expression. It concluded merely that if Mr Vaz and other witnesses had answered the commissioner's questions fully and promptly she would have been able to complete her report in a much shorter time. The committee also said that Mr Vaz was wrong to tell the commissioner in December - eight months after the investigation started - that he would not answer further questions from her. Mr Vaz had answered a very large number of questions by the commissioner since the investigation started in February last year. On June 7 the commissioner wrote to me, as his solicitor, as follows: \"...Mr Vaz has been helpful in discussing these matters and in providing me with written replies and information and you are correct in saying that Mr Vaz has already responded to all the allegations other than informing me whether he had recommended Mr Zaiwalla for an honour. I am glad to receive now the response from Mr Vaz that he recommended Mr Zaiwalla for an honour...\" The delay in responding on the last point was caused simply by Mr Vaz having punctiliously sought advice from the Speaker as to whether he could properly disclose so confidential a matter. When the investigation had dragged on until December Mr Vaz informed the commissioner through me that he believed he had already answered all relevant questions but would be happy to answer any questions which the committee wished him to answer - as he subsequently did. If he was wrong to invite referral to the committee after eight months it was hardly a grievous error. Geoffrey Bindman Bindman &amp; Partners",

Whatever the reasons for his departure - and we are unlikely ever to know exactly what the breaking point was - the vacuum it left could easily have been destabilising. Snowman had taken over in 1998 as general director. It was a time of transition: having been at the helm since 1965, George Christie was in the process of passing the executive chairmanship of the company to his son Gus, while the music director Andrew Davis and the director of productions Graham Vick were due to depart in summer 2000. </p> <p>As soon as the vacancy was known, the rumour mill went into overdrive. Numerous names were linked with the post, and reported sightings down in Sussex of distinguished musical administrators from both sides of the Atlantic only fuelled the speculation. But no firm favourites emerged, and when the announcement of the new general director was made on Monday, it turned out to be someone who had never been mentioned in gossip at all - David Pickard, who is currently chief executive of Britain's top period-instrument ensemble, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlighten ment. </p> <p>The 40-year-old Pickard has been with the OAE since 1993, and has done a very good job there, steadily increasing the range and importance of the orchestra's activities. Before that he had worked in festival and opera administration: he was at Covent Garden in the mid-1980s, and ran the much lamented Kent Opera just before its Arts Council-induced demise in 1990. The OAE has worked regularly at Glyndebourne since 1989, so Pickard presumably knows how the place runs, but nevertheless he is not someone with a proven track record in an opera company of this stature; that alone makes him a surprise choice, and indicates a shift in thinking among the Christie dynasty about the future control of the opera house. </p> <p>When Snowman took over from Anthony Whitworth Jones, he brought with him strong ideas about how he wanted the opera seasons at Glyndebourne to evolve; there was no doubt that he saw himself as much the artistic leader of the company as its head of administration. He was intent on expanding the repertoire, putting on much larger works - Verdi's Otello is scheduled for the coming season - and there was talk of staging The Mastersingers and The Trojans too, as well as commissioning new opera, and attracting a much wider international spectrum of performers. By the time he left many of his initial plans were in place, though all the longer-term ones have been unpicked since his departure, suggesting that he had been a little too robust in his attitude to the status quo. Glyndebourne is a conservative place, with a faithful audience that knows what it likes, and has the financial and social clout to make its feelings known. As an insider suggested to me, by making such radical plans, Snowman had played into the hands of those who had been suspicious of him from the start. </p> <p>It would be surprising if, artistically at least, Pickard will be able to enjoy the same decision-making freedom his predecessor was allowed, however briefly, and he will not be expected to rock the boat as violently as Snowman evidently did. With George Christie still very much on the scene - he now has the title of president of Glyndebourne Productions - the likelihood is that the family will re-exert its influence over what is put on and who delivers it. Glyndebourne, after all, came into existence as a family enterprise, founded by George Christie's father John in the 1930s, just because he enjoyed opera in general and Mozart in particular. Though it has become ever more prestigious, it has never lost sight of that ethos; Pickard's role will be to keep the balance between those who hanker after the days when opera at Glyndebourne was an entertainment for a large extended family, and those who want to see it more at the cutting edge of the art form. </p> <p>Running Glyndebourne has always been seen as a plum opera job, but in the future it may not be such an easy ride.</p>",

There is certainly a case for My Fair Lady to be part of this tradition, since it not only supersedes Pygmalion dramatically, but provides the work with an ending implied by but missing from the original play. </p> <p>Shaw was almost two thirds through his writing lifetime when he hit the jackpot with Pygmalion. In the Roman poet Ovid's first treatment of this mythic tale, King Pygmalion of Cyprus, a sculptor in his spare time, creates a statue of his ideal woman, falls in love with it and, Aphrodite having granted his prayer for the figure to be brought to life as Galatea, marries her. </p> <p>Anybody aware of Shaw's radical reputation in 1912 would have surely found it inexplicable that he had embarked upon his own dramatic adaptation. After all, a king fantasising about and possessing a love object of his own creation would seem to be unpromising material for a Fabian socialist and proponent of feminism. </p> <p>Shaw's abiding obsession was with our language, with the inconsistencies of its spelling and pronunciation and the inadequacies of its alphabet and principles of punctuation. By turning his Pygmalion into a professor of phonetics, Shaw transformed the existing plot into a fable through which he could focus on some of his favourite targets: class, the inequalities of English society, snobbery. But inevitably, too, it made his \"Pygmalion\" - male fantasist figure Henry Higgins - into something like a self-portrait. </p> <p>Shaw avoided any necessity for intervention by the gods: the metamorphosis in his play is accomplished by a girl from the gutter sloughing off her dialect and being taught pronunciation, social behaviour and self-confidence, achieving the status of a princess. But what of the other strand of Ovid's tale, the emotional relationship between Pygmalion, the creator, and Galatea, the creation, ending in marriage? </p> <p>A close reading of Shaw's play reveals that his intention was indeed to create this emotional attachment. Uncharacteristically, he calls his comedy A Romance in Five Acts. The stream of hints in Pygmalion that Higgins will become emotionally attached to Eliza is constant, climaxing when, unable to cope with her departure - prompted by his failure to recognise her as a woman of feeling and sensibility - he searches for her. When he finds her, he blurts: \"Get up and come home and don't be a fool.\" </p> <p>Shaw gives Eliza a double triumph. She conquers fashionable London society, and she becomes independent of her teacher (\"I'm not afraid of you and can do without you\"). But Shaw is still a step away from finding an ending. </p> <p>In early performances the actors actually refused to go along with Shaw's unresolved conclusion. In response to Higgins's final order for her to buy some gloves for him, Eliza had departed the play with, \"Get them yourself\"; but in performance Mrs Patrick Campbell was in the habit of returning as the curtain fell to enquire, \"What size?\" Moreover, as the company took their bows, Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Higgins would present his Eliza with a bouquet, before they posed together in what was unmistakably a wedding photograph tableau. Shaw allegedly disapproved but did not forbid, and their additions were allowed to continue. </p> <p>Shaw was never very good at endings, but the last lines of the published version of Pygmalion in 1916 surely amount to his worst. Higgins tells his mother that Eliza will marry the vacuous and indolent Freddy Eynsford-Hill, and then laughs in repeated mockery at the stupidity of this arrangement - serving only to underline the problem that this outcome is not prepared for by the play, and that the consignment of his heroine to an unhappy, unintelligent and unworthy future leaves a sour taste. </p> <p>The explanation for this conclusion has nothing to do with the lame contrivance of Shaw's Afterword, printed in 1916, in which he first denies that he means anything romantic by his use of the word \"romance\", and proceeds to detail a miserable, impecunious life of drudgery and dependence for Eliza. But this breathtakingly vindictive betrayal can be understood in relation to Shaw's real-life obsession with his leading actress. </p> <p>Give Higgins and Eliza autobiographical identity as Shaw and his protegee Mrs Pat and all becomes clear: Shaw wanted his close relationship with her to continue, but didn't dare propose that it should have a sexual content. A shared life \"for the fun of it\" was as far as the \"Irish pope\" was prepared to go. </p> <p>In between the first performance of the play in 1914 and the publication of the text in 1916, a momentous change had occurred in Shaw's private life. Mrs Pat had married a handsome, aristocratic and empty-headed young man called George Cornwallis-West, despite a flow of letters from GBS begging her not to. Shaw was clearly hurt and felt rejected by the actress he thought owed her fame to him. The 1916 ending and afterword are revealed as a private message willing Mrs Pat to a wretched life in a bad marriage. </p> <p>Shaw again addressed the problem of how to resolve his play when he agreed to write a film script based on it for Gabriel Pascal. The movie ends with the brilliant invention of a despairing Higgins sitting alone, listening to his recording of Eliza's voice and becoming aware that the last sentence has been spoken live, because his pupil has returned. Shaw hinted that hands other than his had been involved in the screenplay. As he accepted his Oscar for writing it, he was asked about his view of the variant ending. \"It's of no consequence,\" he replied. That's as near to a blessing as anybody could expect. </p> <p>The ending of the 1938 film was adopted in its entirety by Alan Jay Lerner in My Fair Lady his brilliant adaptation of Pygmalion for the musical stage. But this was not his only improvement. Even leaving out of account the almost unperformable verbosity of some sections of Shaw's play, its repetitiveness and the long diversion investigating the financial circumstances of Eynsford-Hills, Pygmalion is more static than Lerner's adaptation and places the most intriguing and significant action offstage. </p> <p>It's actually quite a shock to discover that Pygmalion contains no elocution lessons, no moment of celebration when Eliza has \"got it\", no visit to Ascot, no triumph at the ball, no return by Eliza to Covent Garden to discover that she passes unrecognised through the scenes of her past life, and no moment when we see her appalling father in his home territory, as a member of the \"undeserving poor\". So much of the world we assume Shaw created just isn't there. </p> <p>Better still, Lerner searches out the possibilities of musical expression with unerring analytic accuracy, from Higgins's opening diatribe, through the first glorious celebration of Alfred Doolittle's fecklessness, Higgins's disparagement of female friendship, the celebration of Eliza's phonetic breakthrough on The Rain in Spain, and her glorious eruption of independence Without You. Perhaps most triumphantly, I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face dramatises the battle within Higgins and indeed the battle within Shaw, before resolving whether he will allow himself to feel or not. </p> <p>But the real achievement of Lerner's adaptation is his insight that the story requires not one, not two, but three personal journeys. Doolittle is changed into a respectable member of the reviled middle classes; Eliza is changed into an new woman once her \"guttersnipe\" habits are expunged; but the third metamorphosis is of Professor Higgins, who is transformed finally and movingly from a man unable to express his feelings into a more complete emotional human being. Pygmalion is a collection of very brilliant theatrical and comic ideas, but My Fair Lady quite simply is a masterpiece. </p> <p>\u0095 Trevor Nunn is artistic director of the National Theatre.

      "body": "<p>How ironic that the Arts Council of England chose to announce an extra \u00a3100m in spending on theatre over the next three years on the set of a Welsh play, Art and Guff. Wales has often been the poor relation when it comes to showcasing new playwrights: whereas Scotland has the Traverse in Edinburgh and England the Royal Court in London, Wales has no similar institution to attract the energy of young voices. </p> <p>Sgript Cymru, the new national writing company for Wales, and the producer of Art and Guff, was an antidote to this situation. After surviving a complicated birth last May, it has become the new focal point for Welsh writers who write in either language, and has a budget of \u00a3170,000 per year (though it receives \u00a390,000 less than previously provided by the Arts Council of Wales). As well as producing Cath Tregenna's Art and Guff, which premiered at the Soho Theatre, London, Sgript Cymru was also behind the national tour of Gary Owen's Crazy Gary's Mobile Disco, which stopped off at London's Lyric Studio this week. </p> <p>Wales seems to suffer in comparison with Ireland and Scotland when it comes to expressing its identity through theatre. New work from Ireland is everywhere, and the influence it exerts on British theatre can be traced back over 300 years - from Sheridan, Wilde and Synge to the likes of Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Gary Mitchell. With runs in the West End and all over Britain, Irish and Scottish writing has now been legitimised. Wales has no visible canon, so the only way to create a history and theatrical identity for ourselves is through new writing. But why is new Welsh theatre so conspicuously absent from the mainstream? </p> <p>Jack Bradley, literary manager of the National Theatre in London, says the strength of regional voices lies in \"their inherent musicality - whether it be the hard east-coast demotic of David Mamet, the plangent, lyrical quality of Conor McPherson or the modern north London argot of Patrick Marber\". Yet the Welsh use of English has traditionally been ridiculed - \"look you, Boyo\" language is somehow hard for English ears to take seriously. </p> <p>Writer and director Ian Rowlands is in the vanguard of trying to create a national theatre for the Welsh language. In his latest play, Pacific, he writes, \"We are the first and last colony,\" and dismisses reinvention \"for it presupposes that we had been allowed to invent ourselves in the first place\". He claims that the Welsh have only \"survived in the way that England has wanted us to mutate. Now's the chance for us to invent and define ourselves for the first time.\" </p> <p>Sgript Cymru artistic director Bethan Jones, who ran the Welsh-language new writing company Dalier Sylw for 10 years, suggests that Welsh-language writers stopped writing state-of-the-nation plays in the 1980s. \"Welsh-language plays have moved on from the crisis of identity to plays about people, relationships and situations. Up until now those writers who wrote in English strained to find an authentic voice.\" </p> <p>Some, though, still champion their Welshness. The lyrical, emotional writing of Ed Thomas is unashamedly \"state of the nation\". With the feted House of America, he made the theatrical pilgrimage to London, but found his last play, Gas Station Angel, less well received. Thomas's mercurial work subverted cliches and showed that Taff is no longer naff; the old stereotypes were transcended, and the way Welsh people defined themselves was taken in a new direction. </p> <p>New Welsh work is no longer insular. Sgript Cymru is working with the UK's most accomplished touring company of new work, Paines Plough, to take Crazy Gary's Mobile Disco around the country. Gary Owen's remarkably confident first play peels away the cracked veneer of a small town - which just happens to be set in Wales.

      "bodyText": "How ironic that the Arts Council of England chose to announce an extra \u00a3100m in spending on theatre over the next three years on the set of a Welsh play, Art and Guff. Wales has often been the poor relation when it comes to showcasing new playwrights: whereas Scotland has the Traverse in Edinburgh and England the Royal Court in London, Wales has no similar institution to attract the energy of young voices. Sgript Cymru, the new national writing company for Wales, and the producer of Art and Guff, was an antidote to this situation. After surviving a complicated birth last May, it has become the new focal point for Welsh writers who write in either language, and has a budget of \u00a3170,000 per year (though it receives \u00a390,000 less than previously provided by the Arts Council of Wales). As well as producing Cath Tregenna's Art and Guff, which premiered at the Soho Theatre, London, Sgript Cymru was also behind the national tour of Gary Owen's Crazy Gary's Mobile Disco, which stopped off at London's Lyric Studio this week. Wales seems to suffer in comparison with Ireland and Scotland when it comes to expressing its identity through theatre. New work from Ireland is everywhere, and the influence it exerts on British theatre can be traced back over 300 years - from Sheridan, Wilde and Synge to the likes of Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Gary Mitchell. With runs in the West End and all over Britain, Irish and Scottish writing has now been legitimised. Wales has no visible canon, so the only way to create a history and theatrical identity for ourselves is through new writing. But why is new Welsh theatre so conspicuously absent from the mainstream? Jack Bradley, literary manager of the National Theatre in London, says the strength of regional voices lies in \"their inherent musicality - whether it be the hard east-coast demotic of David Mamet, the plangent, lyrical quality of Conor McPherson or the modern north London argot of Patrick Marber\". Yet the Welsh use of English has traditionally been ridiculed - \"look you, Boyo\" language is somehow hard for English ears to take seriously. Writer and director Ian Rowlands is in the vanguard of trying to create a national theatre for the Welsh language. In his latest play, Pacific, he writes, \"We are the first and last colony,\" and dismisses reinvention \"for it presupposes that we had been allowed to invent ourselves in the first place\". He claims that the Welsh have only \"survived in the way that England has wanted us to mutate. Now's the chance for us to invent and define ourselves for the first time.\" Sgript Cymru artistic director Bethan Jones, who ran the Welsh-language new writing company Dalier Sylw for 10 years, suggests that Welsh-language writers stopped writing state-of-the-nation plays in the 1980s. \"Welsh-language plays have moved on from the crisis of identity to plays about people, relationships and situations. Up until now those writers who wrote in English strained to find an authentic voice.\" Some, though, still champion their Welshness. The lyrical, emotional writing of Ed Thomas is unashamedly \"state of the nation\". With the feted House of America, he made the theatrical pilgrimage to London, but found his last play, Gas Station Angel, less well received. Thomas's mercurial work subverted cliches and showed that Taff is no longer naff; the old stereotypes were transcended, and the way Welsh people defined themselves was taken in a new direction. New Welsh work is no longer insular. Sgript Cymru is working with the UK's most accomplished touring company of new work, Paines Plough, to take Crazy Gary's Mobile Disco around the country. Gary Owen's remarkably confident first play peels away the cracked veneer of a small town - which just happens to be set in Wales. Audience reaction around Britain has been positive, although director Vicky Featherstone initially wondered how people outside Wales would respond. She says she wasn't just looking for a \"Welsh\" play, but for \"contemporary work that hits the mark\", adding: \"Gary's work has an incredibly honest energy.\" For Welsh theatre to truly thrive, we have to be comfortable with multiple Welsh identities rather than a single face. Simon Harris, associate director of Sgript Cymru, says, \"I want to escape a climate where a play is thought to be saying 'this is Wales', with all the attendant pressure and incompleteness.

Film stars stay here now, but it was once the holiday home of tsars and tsarinas, the violinist says. He has come a long way since his childhood in Novosibirsk. </p> <p>Repin is not the only prodigy to emerge from that Siberian city. He grew up sharing a teacher with his friend Maxim Vengerov. There is video footage of the two - Vengerov in a frilly shirt, Repin distinctly puddingy - touring the west as teenagers with pianist Evgeny Kissin in the mid-1980s. \"Maxim's presence did a lot of good for me, and vice versa,\" says Repin. \"Being dramatically better than everybody else usually slows you down. You can think too much of yourself and become complacent. But knowing that nearby there is someone who is so wonderful makes you work hard.\" </p> <p>It is fortunate, perhaps especially for Repin, that the two are greatly different players. Vengerov, with his Charlie Chaplin grin and mobile, comic face, is a showman. Repin's approach is less obvious. He doesn't take your breath away, as Vengerov does, but there is more of the poet in him: he plays like someone who has lived a little. The two share an unimpeachable technique, imparted by their teacher, Zhakar Bron. </p> <p>\"He is an extraordinary teacher,\" says Repin. \"He can explain points clearly, and has an extraordinary understanding of the fundamentals of violin playing. At the same time, he is a remarkable player. This combination is extremely rare.\" </p> <p>An important part of Bron's regime, says Repin, was to programme regular performances so his pupils would develop a taste for the concert platform early. \"The children were able to understand what the profession is all about. It's not about practising hard all the time - it's about creating something on stage, about having a relationship with the public.\" But wasn't that a huge pressure? \"It was a pressure, but it meant that, from the beginning, I understood the goal of my work. You cannot expect a child to practise for five or six hours a day unless she or he understands the goal - the emotions you get back when you perform.\" </p> <p>Repin, 29, started studying with Bron at five and a half, having learnt the basics for six months at a local music school; the regime of six hours' practice a day started when he was 10. \"It was, of course, a huge effort. But it paid off,\" he says. \"By the time I was 10 I was performing in concerts abroad. It was incredible. I felt like an artist already. It was like a drug. It's still like a drug.\" </p> <p>But still, doesn't all this talk of \"work\" and \"profession\" sound a little hard when applied to tiny children? \"When I go to the US, say, I meet parents who tell me about their musical children, but they are worried they won't succeed and say they should study something else and continue with music afterwards if they want to. </p> <p>\"In Russia this attitude would never exist. There, once you decide that you want to do music it becomes your goal, the purpose of your life. That attitude is hard - but it is better to do one thing with all your effort.\" </p> <p>In fact, it was Repin's mother, a hospital sister who still lives in Novosibirsk, who decided his destiny for him. \"She saw how I played with musical toys when I was a baby; how I picked out tunes quickly. It was her idea that I should become a musician. It became her obsession.\" </p> <p>And his. Repin tells how, cycling back home from a rehearsal when he was in his teens, he fell asleep during a raging storm and came a cropper against a lamppost. A broken collarbone prevented him from playing for three months. \"Yes, I had been practising too hard,\" he concedes. </p> <p>Repin can't imagine doing anything but music - \"I think about it last thing at night and when I wake up in the morning.\" Like many of his compatriots he cut his teeth on Russian music: he recorded Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No 2 and Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No 1 in 1995, moving on to performing Brahms and Mozart later - with the help and advice of Yehudi Menuhin (\"a very beautiful and inspiring man, a sort of icon to me; a great example of humanism\"). He calls Shostakovich's First Violin Concerto \"one of the three absolute giants, along with the Beethoven and Brahms concertos. It is one of those rare pieces that makes you forget about everything as soon as you play it. Shostakovich to me is unique, in the sense that he was a writer of history as much as of music.\" </p> <p>The concerto had a troubled birth. It was composed in 1948 for Russian violinist David Oistrakh, but the premiere was delayed until 1955, when Stalin was safely dead. It's a disturbing, intense, darkly witty piece of work. Does being Russian aid Repin's understanding of this writer of history? \"It helps that I can talk to Mstislav Rostropovich, who knew Shostakovich. It helps that I am Russian. But, on the other hand, musicians are like actors. If you perform a piece, you have to dedicate yourself to its character as an actor would a part. It is a question of sensitivity.\" </p> <p>Nowadays Repin's punishing regime is less to do with six hours' practice a day than the endless trudge from city to city and country to country.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton's hopes that the furore over his presidential pardons might subside were blown apart yesterday when the US justice department allowed a New York federal prosecutor to begin a criminal investigation of all 177 last-minute clemency cases. The huge expansion of the inquiry into the pardons and commutations issued by Mr Clinton in his last hours in the White House means that the former president, members of his family and his associates could potentially face criminal charges if prosecutors find evidence that any of the pardons involved offers of cash or other favours. Until yesterday, the New York prosecutor, Mary Jo White, had been examining only three high profile pardons, those of the fugitive financier Marc Rich, a case involving four Hasidic Jews convicted of fraud, and an allegation that Roger Clinton, the former president's half-brother, received up to $200,000 for helping a Texas man to win a pardon. The decision by the new US attorney general, John Ashcroft, to let Ms White loose on all 177 pardons potentially transforms the argument about the decisions that Mr Clinton made on January 20. Until now, he as suffered nothing worse than a personal public relations catastrophe. But Ms White's investigation may lead to criminal charges against him, his wife Hillary, their close relatives and some of their oldest confidants. \"She is going to be doing the investigation of all of these cases,\" a justice department official told the Los Angeles Times yesterday, which broke the story. \"It is yet to be decided if she will refer some evidence to other jurisdictions for prosecutions, if that develops.\" At the heart of the investigation will be the pardons which emerged from the intensive lobbying by friends and colleagues of the Clintons, and which circumvented the traditional procedures by which pardon candidates have their cases reviewed by justice department legal officials. Although previous presidents issued many more pardons than Mr Clinton did, and although some of his predecessors also issued \"stealth pardons\" in highly suspect circumstances, he appears to be unique in issuing so many last-minute pardons on the basis of personal connections, and without going through the normal procedures. So far the pre-eminent examples of this type were the pardons of Mr Rich and his business partner Pincus Green. More than 30 of the pardons and commutations he issued on his last day were not reviewed by the justice department's pardon attorneys, a process which normally takes between 18 and 24 months and is designed to provide a full assessment of the facts and issues involved in a possible act of clemency. Most of the cases that escaped such scrutiny were advocated by people close to Mr Clinton, including his brother-in-law Hugh Rodham, his close friend Harry Thomason, and major Democratic political donors, such as Beth Dozoretz and Mr Rich's former wife, Denise. One of the most prominent of the new cases Ms White is examining is the early release from prison of a convicted Los Angeles drug dealer, Carlos Vignali, whose case was pressed by several prominent local LA officials as well as by Mr Rodham, who was paid $200,000 by Mr Vignali's father, Horacio, for his help. Mr Rodham subsequently returned the money. The decision by Mr Ashcroft - who until last November was a conservative Republican senator - to refer all the cases to Ms White rather than use his power to appoint a special prosecutor to look into them gives the Bush administration the best of both worlds: it takes the pardons furore out of the immediate headlines, a development for which the White House has been pressing Republican congressional leaders, but it preserves the possibility that the Clintons and their friends may eventually end up in court. Ms White, a Clinton appointee, will be able to decide whether to prosecute any cases herself or refer them to federal prosecutors in other parts of the US.",

      "body": "<p>In the final part of <strong> The Art Of Crime</strong> (C4), a pair of conmen reflected on their chequered careers. Neither liked the term \"conman\". \"It's a horrible word\", complained Daniel Riordan, who had spent 20 years robbing gullible high street businesses by pretending to be an auditor sent from head office. Tony McManus, an art dealer who specialised in fakes, preferred to think of his activities as a form of psychological warfare, in which he earned his success by outsmarting his customers. </p> <p>Riordan's yarns about legging it out of back doors and fire escapes with used notes fluttering from his pockets typecast him as a simple scam-artist prone to acting on the spur of the moment. \"I've got this sense about me,\" he admitted. \"I can look at someone and go, 'ooh, I can do them'.\" When he was arrested for the last time, after becoming a regular star of Crimewatch and trying to stave off the inevitable by getting all his mates to ring up the programme to give false information about his whereabouts, the scene had the air of an Ealing comedy. \"It was all over,\" he confessed. \"It was like, 'let's run the credits'.\" </p> <p>But if Riordan was merely a low-life opportunist, Tony McManus was a subtler and more intriguing case. Although he admitted he had no moral qualms about deceiving his clients, and thought that anybody stupid enough to be taken in by him deserved everything they got (or rather, lost), it was almost possible to see what he meant when he claimed, regarding some of his activities, \"that to me is business, that's not crime\". </p> <p>One of his craftier ploys was to sell a customer a fake painting, guaranteeing in writing to buy it back from them 12 months hence for more than they'd paid for it. As he pointed out, this was a better offer than you'd get from your bank manager. He'd be as good as his word, then sell the painting on to another customer at a price still further inflated. This would keep his cash flow going and increase the perceived value of the painting. Was he committing a worse crime than selling somebody an unsuitable and over-priced pension, or an endowment mortgage which failed to live up to the promises originally made for it? If hustlers from the financial services industry were hauled out from behind the fa\u00e7ade of respectability of their fancily titled City firms, identified as conmen and put on trial, the public might find that their savings suddenly experienced a dramatic increase in value. </p> <p>McManus also exploited the snobbery within the art world, where customers pretend to know more than they do, and might as well walk into a gallery with a flashing light on their head saying \"Mug\". When they eventually discover they've bought a house-full of fakes, they feel too humiliated to go to the police. Displaying an infallible instinct for human weakness, McManus later diversified into the wine trade. Just before the wedding of Charles and Diana, he bought a job lot of wine - \"it was grotesque, you would not have put it on your chips\" - then stuck Royal Wedding commemorative labels on it and increased the price tenfold. The stuff sold by the skipload, and the real beauty of the scheme was that hardly anybody opened the bottles for fear of destroying their souvenir value. It was enough to make you contemplate a life of crime, almost. </p> <p>Interestingly, The Art Of Crime was narrated by Paul McGann, who also supplied the voice-over for <strong> The Men Who Changed Football</strong> (BBC2). This was a detailed if slightly laborious account of the way a cluster of thrusting entrepreneurs seized control of several key football clubs in the 1980s, and transformed a sport crippled by hooliganism, croneyism and under-investment into the cash landslide it is today. McGann's tone was identical across both programmes, whether he was describing the way Daniel Riordan nicked 13 grand from the safe at Pizza Hut in Scarborough or recounting how Irving Scholar devised the brilliant wheeze of turning Tottenham Hotspur into a high-profile marketing brand. We heard how Ken Bates bought Chealsea for \u00a31 and indeed at the point when the football film featured a walk-on appearance by Robert Maxwell, it became difficult to remember which programme was which.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The logistical nightmare of the Six Nations championship was no closer to a resolution last night, with the chances of the tournament being completed this season receding fast despite an English suggestion that postponed matches could be played at neutral venues. With foot and mouth now confirmed in France, Saturday's game in Paris against Wales is still on but doubts are being expressed about the Heineken Cup semi-final between Munster and Stade Fran\u00e7ais, scheduled for Lille next month. Most of the Munster team are Ireland squad regulars and, if the Irish government sticks to its 30-day quarantine for countries where the disease has been reported, rearranging Ireland's matches against England and Scotland will have to be done with the Munster men's commitments in mind. The Six Nations committee, in a telephone conference, has so far rejected English calls to reschedule their Dublin game, postponed from March 24, to late May, sticking to the original provisional date of May 5 which clashes with important domestic English fixtures. The Rugby Football Union's chief executive Francis Baron described the decision as \"stupid\", saying there was no realistic chance of foot and mouth being contained swiftly enough, but just about every other contingency plan also now looks fatally flawed. The RFU, for instance, tried to persuade European Rugby Cup Ltd that moving the Heineken Cup final back a week from May 19 to May 26 might suit all concerned, only for French TV to object to any change. The other hope lies in finding neutral city venues in continental Europe such as Paris or Rome, but again the Irish government would have to weaken its stance significantly to make that idea fly.

That's why we've got to be creative,\" said Baron, conceding that a doubt hangs over England's home game with France on April 7. \"Clearly the news today is not good and we're keeping our fingers crossed.\" The RFU has started to rearrange Premiership fixtures for March 24 to fill the void left by the Irish postponement. Meanwhile English officials have lodged a bid to host the 2007 World Cup and are also advocating the introduction of promotion and relegation to the existing Six Nations, to help boost the game in Europe. That would involve setting up a second tier of nations including Spain, Romania, Portugal and the Netherlands. \"We are anxious to say to the Six Nations committee that we have the best competition in the world,\" said the RFU's management board chairman Brian Baister. \"At the moment it is focused at the top on who will win the championship.

But then the Princess Royal is hardly most drivers.</p> <p>When she spotted the police car while driving her Bentley on the A417 outside Gloucester on August 27 last year she assumed that, as on so many occasions in the past, it had come to escort her to an engagement at a nearby agricultural college - and so she accelerated into its view.</p> <p>But yesterday Cheltenham magistrates fined the princess \u00a3400 with \u00a330 costs and gave her five points on her licence after she pleaded guilty by post to the offence.</p> <p>Graham Sacker, chairman of the court, said the size of the fine reflected the fact that the princess was \"a person of high means\".</p> <p>Sheila Bowden, prosecuting, told the court how officers on a bridge overlooking the road saw the princess's car following a line of slow-moving traffic from the Air Balloon pub at Birdlip near Brockworth. \"The Bentley then moved into the outside lane of the dual carriageway and sped forward,\" she said. \"The officers formed the opinion that she was speeding, checked her speed, and it registered at 93mph.\"</p> <p>Describing the princess's postal testimony, court clerk Kim Edge said she had been \"on her way to an official engagement at Hartpury college .. she saw the police car and believed it was waiting to escort her on her journey. She accelerated from behind the traffic in front of her to a clear part of the road so the officers could see her.</p> <p>\"The police car then went on to the A417 and followed her. The car's blue lights flashed briefly, and she believed that was a signal acknowledging they were escorting her.\"</p> <p>Had she been under escort, the princess would have been exempt from speeding offences. But in the circumstances, a spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said yesterday, \"the princess accepts that she is subject to the normal rule of law and she will be paying her fine accordingly.\"</p> <p>Princess Anne was given a written warning for speeding on the M1 in 1972, and fined \u00a340 for doing 96mph on the same road five years later. In 1990 she was fined \u00a3150 and banned from driving for a month after pleading guilty to two speeding offences before magistrates at Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For most drivers doing 93mph on a 70mph dual carriageway the presence of a police car on one's tail, blue lights flashing, would convey an unambiguous message. But then the Princess Royal is hardly most drivers. When she spotted the police car while driving her Bentley on the A417 outside Gloucester on August 27 last year she assumed that, as on so many occasions in the past, it had come to escort her to an engagement at a nearby agricultural college - and so she accelerated into its view. But yesterday Cheltenham magistrates fined the princess \u00a3400 with \u00a330 costs and gave her five points on her licence after she pleaded guilty by post to the offence. Graham Sacker, chairman of the court, said the size of the fine reflected the fact that the princess was \"a person of high means\". Sheila Bowden, prosecuting, told the court how officers on a bridge overlooking the road saw the princess's car following a line of slow-moving traffic from the Air Balloon pub at Birdlip near Brockworth. \"The Bentley then moved into the outside lane of the dual carriageway and sped forward,\" she said. \"The officers formed the opinion that she was speeding, checked her speed, and it registered at 93mph.\" Describing the princess's postal testimony, court clerk Kim Edge said she had been \"on her way to an official engagement at Hartpury college .. she saw the police car and believed it was waiting to escort her on her journey. She accelerated from behind the traffic in front of her to a clear part of the road so the officers could see her. \"The police car then went on to the A417 and followed her. The car's blue lights flashed briefly, and she believed that was a signal acknowledging they were escorting her.\" Had she been under escort, the princess would have been exempt from speeding offences. But in the circumstances, a spokeswoman for Buckingham Palace said yesterday, \"the princess accepts that she is subject to the normal rule of law and she will be paying her fine accordingly.\" Princess Anne was given a written warning for speeding on the M1 in 1972, and fined \u00a340 for doing 96mph on the same road five years later. In 1990 she was fined \u00a3150 and banned from driving for a month after pleading guilty to two speeding offences before magistrates at Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire.",

Adapted from one of the latter's stories, it stars a miscast Kenneth Branagh as Deep South lawyer Rick Magruder, who gets into bed with, and heavily into the case of, Embeth Davidtz's Mallory: a woman with an unstable dad (Robert Duvall) threatening her life. With its primal elements and neurotic characters, Altman's film tries to inject a little chaos theory into the courtroom-orderly Grisham, but the suspense goes missing. Paul Howlett Sport Live Tennis 8pm, British Eurosport The Tennis Masters Series tournament in Indian Wells is prestigious - and lucrative - enough to attract the world's best players and by now, quarter-final day in the women's event, that's all that should be left. Martina Hingis is looking for her third consecutive singles title and is helped by a draw that kept her apart from both Williams sisters and Lindsay Davenport until the final. Simon Burnton",

The Vatican has argued that Italian courts have no jurisdiction over the radio and declined to pass on the court's summons to the three officials: Father Roberto Tucci, who was made a cardinal last month and who is chairman of the radio's management board; Father Pasquale Borgomeo, its director general; and Costantino Pacifici, the deputy technical director. The 430 hectare site on which the transmitters stand enjoys extra-territorial status under the terms of a 1951 treaty between the Vatican and the Italian state, and any dispute over its operation should be resolved through bilateral negotiations, church officials insist. The judge, Andrea Calabria, disagreed. He told the prosecutors that they had erred in issuing a summons to the defendants through diplomatic channels but established the important principle that his court did have jurisdiction, adjourning the trial until the autumn. The case has caused sharp divisions within the Italian government, with the environment minister signing up as a civil party to the trial and the foreign ministry expressing the opinion that the Holy See was justified in invoking the extra-territorial status of the transmitter site. Environmental groups have been more aggressive, with some calling on the European Union's environment commissioner to intervene in the dispute and others suggesting that the Vatican officials should be prosecuted for manslaughter. The Vatican says it already respects internationally recognised safety norms and that there is no reliable scientific evidence to support claims that electromagnetic radiation constitutes a health hazard. \"We have a son with leukaemia and very high levels of electromagnetic pollution in our home,\" retorted Maria Angelone, a member of a residents' committee in Cesano. \"It's not up to us to prove the connection of cause and effect.

      "body": "<p>John Bayley, in the latest of the Daily Telegraph's tell-all instalments of the life of John Bayley, aged 75 and a quarter, records being stalked in the early days of his widowhood, a couple of years ago, by a graduate student he calls Mella (not her real name. Not, for legal reasons, anyone's real name). Guessing, astutely, that the way to a man's heart is through his cork tiles, Mella opened her assault on the widower-Bayley by mopping the kitchen floor. Hardly had the echo of wet slap on tile died away, than the young lady was doing a full-starfish upstairs on the Bayley-Murdoch bed (\"our bed!\"). She felt \"faint\", the cunning little minx claimed. Did she hell. </p> <p>A solicitous Bayley, ever the gentleman, went to see if his young helper was OK. Perhaps a glass of water was required, some wrist chafing, or the smelling salts that he'd left somewhere in the bedroom. He approached Mella's recumbent, supine and suspiciously splayed form \"fascinated\". Faintness was not, it transpired, the problem. Suddenly, \"Mella sprang up, threw her arms round my neck and gave me several kisses at random\". She then dragged the old geezer down on to the bed. \"At least we were both fully clothed,\" he piously records. Then, after an ellipsis, the awful admission: \"A couple of hours later, we were not.\" Quite how this and the humpy-rumpy that followed came about, Bayley sighs, \"is still uncertain to me\". He too has his faint spells, apparently. One thing was clear. He had been, as he wonderingly recalls, \"manhandled by a slip of a girl\". Old codger rogered, read all about it. </p> <p>\"Mella\", as Bayley vaguely tells us, \"might be in her early 30s\" (although, as he ungallantly records, \"her naked body was scrawny\"). That means, the lady \"might be\" some 45 years her victim's junior. Mella, however, was no fluke. Barely had the duvet on \"our bed\" cooled than another of Bayley's \"designing women\" was hammering on his door and breezing in with a \"hallo Johnny\" as if she owned the place and its coy owner. Margot, too, we learn, has jumped the Bayley bones - coming to disturb his slumbers, wholly uninvited, in the middle of the night. </p> <p>Why, Bayley wonders, are these women throwing themselves at him? Well he might. The photograph of the author, accompanying the extracts in the Telegraph, gives no easy answer to that vexing question. Nor, one guesses, does his shaving mirror when - exhausted by the night's exertions - Johnny drags himself to the privacy of his bathroom (one of the few places in his widower's house uninvaded, apparently, by these sex-maddened Oxonian predators). He is, though dignified and serene-looking, no oil painting. But he should surely think about donating his pheromones to science after death. There's something in them that the rest of us men would really like to get hold of. Essence de Bayley - dab a spot behind your ears and buy a baseball bat to fight the bimbos off. </p> <p>The reaction of most male readers to Bayley's confessions will be: \"Good on you, John\"; \"There's life in the old dog yet\"; or, as Yeats put it (when he, too, was in his 70s), \"An aged man is but a paltry thing,/A tattered coat upon a stick, unless/Soul clap its hand and sing.\" At the very least, Bayley seems to have got through his grieving process in record time. The Casanova therapy should clearly be available (with a lavish supply of Viagra) on the national health for bereaved male spouses. And, as Bayley fondly imagines, from the great beyond Iris (restored to sanity) looked indulgently down on his bed-sport with Mella, \"smiling in the same old way\". Are there no rolling pins in heaven? </p> <p>Women readers, I suspect, have more mixed reactions to John's sexual confessions. Imagine the following. A distinguished critic and don develops Alzheimer's disease in his 78th year. His wife, an equally distinguished philosopher (and about the same age), tenderly nurses him during the painful years of his tragic decline. After his death, she writes a moving account of his enfeebled and demented last years, called John. It becomes a bestseller. Film rights are sold. Anthony Hopkins is contracted to play the part of the suffering John. A few months after her husband's death, a young postgraduate, called Fella (in his early, lusty 30s) attaches himself to the 75-year-old Iris. He is evidently love-stricken, and offers to clean the coal-hole. He goes upstairs on some flimsy pretext - to adjust his T-shirt, or whatever. Iris follows, innocently (the stairs, however, are difficult when you are 75). Fella is lying, naked, muscular and proudly erect on the bed. He pulls her down for a spot of the old ellipsis. All goes dark and breathless. </p> <p>At what point do you stop the above narrative on the grounds of rank improbability? Few, I guess, would let it run as far as the bedroom. It's against nature for a young jock to lust after an old woman. Old women do not pull young guys. Fish do not fly. </p> <p>This gender inequity is so ingrained in our culture that it seems a fact of nature. In the novel everyone's talking about, David Lodge's Thinks . . . the cocksman hero, Ralph Messenger, is in his mid-50s. His targeted victim, demure novelist Helen Reed, is in her nubile early-40s. Reverse those ages, have Helen bed Roger as easily as one might pluck a ripe plum, and would the novel flow as smoothly as it does? I think not. </p> <p>So it goes throughout the ranks of literature, TV soap, and film. Hannibal Lecter is, to the eye (and in terms of the actors' real ages) 30 years older than Clarice Starling. Imagine it the other way round. Sixty-year-old agent Starling, that is, and a 30-year-old psychopathic serial killer, the two of them ending up happily ever after. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Higgins is 30 years older than Eliza Doolittle. Can one imagine a 20-year-old professor coaching a 50-year-old flower-girl through The Rain in Spain? My unfair lady? Arthur Clennam is decades older than Little Dorrit. Can you think of a single Dickens (happy) marriage in which the woman is older than the man? Is Romeo older than Juliet? Yes. Can we think it the other way round? No. </p> <p>John Bayley's obituary file must be, since it began being stocked in the 1960s, the most rewritten in Fleet street. Up to his retirement in 1990 from the Warton Chair in Oxford, he was superdon - one of the most respected academic critics in the country, but little known outside his profession. In retirement - so miscalled - professor emeritus Bayley established himself as one of the country's leading journalists and reviewers. When in the late 1990s his wife's descent into terminal illness began, he was elevated to near sanctity. Best of husbands. On his wife's death, he amazed his friends with two memoirs whose candour Blake Morrison might have envied. Jilly Cooper could have enivied his sales and the film adaptation inspired by Iris. He remarried. And now, John Bayley, sexual athlete. What next? Superdon on Mars?</p>",

Anthony Hopkins is contracted to play the part of the suffering John. A few months after her husband's death, a young postgraduate, called Fella (in his early, lusty 30s) attaches himself to the 75-year-old Iris. He is evidently love-stricken, and offers to clean the coal-hole. He goes upstairs on some flimsy pretext - to adjust his T-shirt, or whatever. Iris follows, innocently (the stairs, however, are difficult when you are 75). Fella is lying, naked, muscular and proudly erect on the bed. He pulls her down for a spot of the old ellipsis. All goes dark and breathless. At what point do you stop the above narrative on the grounds of rank improbability? Few, I guess, would let it run as far as the bedroom. It's against nature for a young jock to lust after an old woman. Old women do not pull young guys. Fish do not fly. This gender inequity is so ingrained in our culture that it seems a fact of nature. In the novel everyone's talking about, David Lodge's Thinks . . . the cocksman hero, Ralph Messenger, is in his mid-50s. His targeted victim, demure novelist Helen Reed, is in her nubile early-40s. Reverse those ages, have Helen bed Roger as easily as one might pluck a ripe plum, and would the novel flow as smoothly as it does? I think not. So it goes throughout the ranks of literature, TV soap, and film. Hannibal Lecter is, to the eye (and in terms of the actors' real ages) 30 years older than Clarice Starling. Imagine it the other way round. Sixty-year-old agent Starling, that is, and a 30-year-old psychopathic serial killer, the two of them ending up happily ever after. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Higgins is 30 years older than Eliza Doolittle. Can one imagine a 20-year-old professor coaching a 50-year-old flower-girl through The Rain in Spain? My unfair lady? Arthur Clennam is decades older than Little Dorrit. Can you think of a single Dickens (happy) marriage in which the woman is older than the man? Is Romeo older than Juliet? Yes. Can we think it the other way round? No. John Bayley's obituary file must be, since it began being stocked in the 1960s, the most rewritten in Fleet street. Up to his retirement in 1990 from the Warton Chair in Oxford, he was superdon - one of the most respected academic critics in the country, but little known outside his profession. In retirement - so miscalled - professor emeritus Bayley established himself as one of the country's leading journalists and reviewers. When in the late 1990s his wife's descent into terminal illness began, he was elevated to near sanctity. Best of husbands. On his wife's death, he amazed his friends with two memoirs whose candour Blake Morrison might have envied. Jilly Cooper could have enivied his sales and the film adaptation inspired by Iris. He remarried. And now, John Bayley, sexual athlete. What next? Superdon on Mars?",

The veins and arteries restructure themselves to acclimatise, the muscles of the heart break down and change shape. Sergei Avdeyev has subjected his heart to more strain than any other cosmonaut in the history of space travel. The 748 days he spent in space - over three separate trips to the Russian space station Mir between 1992 and 1999 - make him the world's most experienced cosmonaut. Sheltered inside the sealed environment of Mir's living quarters, his body has orbited the earth 11,968 times, transported some 321m miles through the cosmos. </p> <p>His final mission lasted one year and two weeks, double the time he had planned for. On his return, he was brought out from the capsule on a stretcher - too weak to walk, unable to sit up in a chair without slumping forward. It was a year before his heart repaired itself and his body readjusted to gravity. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, the memory of Mir has been placing a new, more subtle burden on his heart - emotional rather than physical. As the space station's longest resident, preparations for the imminent destruction of his former home have elicited confused feelings of regret, sadness and a trace of ir ritation. </p> <p>Avdeyev has been invited as a celebrity guest on a flight chartered to circle Mir's crash zone, joining scientists and rich space enthusiasts to watch fragments of the station crash in a blaze of thousands of incandescent pieces in the middle of the Pacific ocean; the precise date of the last plunge remains unclear, but if Mir keeps falling at its current speed, Russian space engineers expect its smouldering remains to hit the sea at about 120 miles an hour some time next Wednesday. </p> <p>As fellow passengers gasp at the sight of what organisers promise will be the century's \"most spectacular celestial event\", Avdeyev will be witnessing the sophisticated technology to which he has dedicated most of his career disintegrate into smouldering wreckage. </p> <p>At their home in an unusually lavish north Moscow compound built exclusively for cosmonauts, his wife, Maria, remarks that the event will feel like the funeral of an old friend. Avdeyev shies away from such an undisguised admission of sentimentality, giving a more scientific account of his anticipated emotions. \"On the surface I will react to it like an engineer. I know every piece of technology has an expiry date, I know there is an end to everything,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But as a person I will be sad - sorry to lose the place where I spent more than two years of my life. A few of my belongings are still up there - we couldn't bring everything back down with us, so some of my books and work remain. I knew every corner of the vessel by heart, the place where I slept, the window I looked out of. Of course it hurts a bit.\" </p> <p>Quietly reserved, and loyal to the space agency which continues to employ him, Avdeyev has not joined the band of fellow Mir veterans who have been campaigning against Mir's death sentence, protesting on Moscow streets that Russia is foolishly abandoning one of its last claims to superpower status. </p> <p>But he believes that had the Russian government committed itself to securing the station's future several years ago and provided the necessary funds for improvements, Mir could have continued operating safely for several more years - despite having recently marked its 15th birthday, 10 more than it was designed to withstand. Instead there was confusion and bad planning, he says, worsened by money problems. The Russian space agency officials do not agree. Their position is that there was no alternative to destroying Mir because it was an increasingly dangerous liability. \"We cannot continue this game of Russian roulette,\" the agency's head said last year as he pronounced the death sentence. </p> <p>It is not a subject Avdeyev enjoys discussing. \"The decision has been taken and these debates now are useless,\" he concludes firmly and disappears into the yard for a while to dish out some of his rocket engineer's expertise to one of his cosmonaut neighbours who has a problem with his car. </p> <p>When he returns, he explains that since Mir cannot be saved he wants at least to convey his delight at having been part of the project. Dismayed at the abysmal press the station has attracted over the accident-ridden last years of its life (which earned it the nickname of Starship Lada in the west) he is keen to highlight the achievements. </p> <p>In tribute to the station, he has put on the Star Trek-style turquoise space jacket that he wore on board especially for the interview, his name embroidered in Russian and English letters across the chest beneath the Russian tricolour. On his feet he wears a pair of slippers. Mir memorabilia covers the walls of the house he received in reward for his work as on-board engineer - Russian matrioshka dolls painted with the faces of cosmonaut heroes lined up next to photographs of the desert-like plains of Earth viewed from space. </p> <p>Every minute of the 748 days he spent on board was mapped out according to a timetable drawn up several weeks earlier. The day began at 0800 hours, according to Moscow time, when alarm clocks on the cosmonauts' wrist watches were programmed to go off. </p> <p>Avdeyev slept in a floating sleeping bag attached to the wall of one of the station's side modules. \"Sleeping in a weightless environment is very comfortable once you get used to it because any position - face up or down, on your left side or on your right - feels the same. In your head you tell yourself where is up, so you can pretend to be sleeping lying down, with a pillow under your head. But the concept of what is the ceiling and what is the floor is all in the mind,\" he says. </p> <p>The frequent reappearances of dawn and sunset were also confusing to Mir novices. The station passes through night and day 16 times in 24 hours, so in the 20 minutes it took to get up in the morning it often changed from light to dark. Their days were divided between conducting scientific experiments, exercising on a rotation of running and bicycle machines, tending to the station's needs and eating. Cosmonauts prepared their own food, carefully decanting hot water into cellophane packages of dehydrated meals chosen from the rows of plastic drawers in the store room. Even when international cosmonauts started visiting, the diet remained Russian - cabbage broth, beetroot soup, porridge and buckwheat; the meals were not good. To create a feeling of being at home, they sat at a table to eat - the food strapped to the surface, their feet hooked into rings on the floor to ground them. </p> <p>With each mission more and more human paraphernalia was left on board; cosmonauts built up a library of books (from Pushkin's poetry to rocket manuals). CD collections gathered on board; Avdeyev's team liked to blast Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and Russian rock through the modules as they exercised. In the evening they listened to taped recordings of nature - the sea, birds and forest noises - on headphones to block out the constant blast of the engines and ventilators. </p> <p>Family photographs were taped to the walls; a black and white portrait of Yuri Gagarin was hung in the central chamber alongside an icon.

When staffing and financial problems at Moscow's Star City space headquarters meant that he was obliged to remain an extra six unplanned-for months in space from 1998 to 1999, the distance from their lives saddened him. \"The Russian government changed three times while I was out at work.

The criticism has so shaken the Israeli army that it has partially relaxed its siege.</p> <p>The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, Brigadier General Benny Gantz, told reporters that the barriers went up because the army had received threats of a car bomb being plotted by two dozen Fatah militia field commanders living inside Ramallah. But a day after stationing an armoured personnel carrier at the southern entrance to an area with a population of more than 200,000, the army claimed it had foiled the attack.</p> <p>Other towns in the West Bank have been penned in for months. In the old city of Hebron 40,000 Palestinians have been under almost constant curfew so that the army can protect the 200 Jewish settlers living in their midst.</p> <p>Other towns - such as Nablus - are accessible only by a dirt road through the mountains, and heaps of earth and concrete barriers have blocked all entry points to some West Bank villages.</p> <p>At least 10 Palestinians have died in the last six months because Israeli soldiers blocked ambulances at military checkpoints or because they were unable to reach hospitals, the director of the Palestinian medical relief committee, Mustafa Barghouti, said.</p> <p>Israel terms these measures as \"internal closure\". For the Palestinians, Israeli restrictions are evidence that they remain under military occupation, six years after the arrival of self-rule.</p> <p>As Monday's demonstration at Bir Zeit university shows, middle class and educated Palestinians who stayed away from the stone-throwing protests at the start of the intifada are beginning to mobilise against Israel's siege.</p> <p>Mr Sharon knows that it is not physically possible to separate Israel from the Palestinians, and that the economy of the Jewish state does not function without cheap Palestinian labour. But such restrictions are a signal to an anxious domestic audience that the old warrior remains as tough as ever.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,451506,00.html\">Europe turns up heat on Israel</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "There was the elegantly turned out Hanan Ashrawi, in silk scarf and tailored jacket, heaving a pitchfork of earth into a three-metre trench dug by the Israeli army. The image of the Palestinians' most prominent woman - and eloquent defender - at the frontline of the protests against Israel's siege of Bir Zeit university, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, has at last drawn world attention to nearly six months of systematic restriction on civilian movement that has destroyed the economy, and caused widespread suffering. The trenches and earth barriers that went up around Bir Zeit at the weekend marked the first tangible display of how Ariel Sharon intends to end a Palestinian uprising, and restore a sense of security to his own people. But as EU and American condemnation of Israel's tightened siege made evident yesterday, such drastic measures are not internationally acceptable. The criticism has so shaken the Israeli army that it has partially relaxed its siege. The commander of Israeli forces in the West Bank, Brigadier General Benny Gantz, told reporters that the barriers went up because the army had received threats of a car bomb being plotted by two dozen Fatah militia field commanders living inside Ramallah. But a day after stationing an armoured personnel carrier at the southern entrance to an area with a population of more than 200,000, the army claimed it had foiled the attack. Other towns in the West Bank have been penned in for months. In the old city of Hebron 40,000 Palestinians have been under almost constant curfew so that the army can protect the 200 Jewish settlers living in their midst. Other towns - such as Nablus - are accessible only by a dirt road through the mountains, and heaps of earth and concrete barriers have blocked all entry points to some West Bank villages. At least 10 Palestinians have died in the last six months because Israeli soldiers blocked ambulances at military checkpoints or because they were unable to reach hospitals, the director of the Palestinian medical relief committee, Mustafa Barghouti, said. Israel terms these measures as \"internal closure\". For the Palestinians, Israeli restrictions are evidence that they remain under military occupation, six years after the arrival of self-rule. As Monday's demonstration at Bir Zeit university shows, middle class and educated Palestinians who stayed away from the stone-throwing protests at the start of the intifada are beginning to mobilise against Israel's siege. Mr Sharon knows that it is not physically possible to separate Israel from the Palestinians, and that the economy of the Jewish state does not function without cheap Palestinian labour. But such restrictions are a signal to an anxious domestic audience that the old warrior remains as tough as ever. Europe turns up heat on Israel",

This, then, was going to be one of Old Trafford's blue-collar occasions; a reminder that hard work lies at the heart of every team's success and never mind the trimmings. It was no coincidence that Butt, with his tenacity in winning possession and keen use of the ball, frequently caught the eye. Chadwick, too, with a cross from the right, swinging away from the goalkeeper, that Beckham could hardly have bettered. Solskjaer could not quite reach it and when Chadwick sent Scholes clear 10 minutes before half-time Sidorczuk, diving low at his feet, bravely smothered the opportunity. Another five minutes and sweet passing by Keane and Butt released Chadwick on the right with Sheringham waiting unmarked in front of goal. Chadwick's final ball, however, was poor and by the time Sheringham controlled it defenders were back to cover. Markus Schopp remained a lively presence on the right for Sturm and once Imre Szabics joined Haas up front for the second half the Austrian team gave United's defenders marginally more work to do. After Gary Neville had fouled Gunther Neukircher a hard, low shot from Ivica Vastic produced an urgent save from Fabien Barthez, his first of the night. By and large, however, the game remained in the grip of United's midfield, who controlled the tempo and pattern much as they wished. Chadwick's versatility was emphasised when he switched to the left and continued to gnaw at the Graz cover. \u0095 The Group B game between Paris St-Germain and Galatasaray was delayed for 25 minutes after fighting broke out between rival fans and two visiting supporters ran on to the pitch. Five fans were taken to hospital. PSG won 2-0 at home as Galatasaray dropped to second behind Deportivo la Coruna, who drew 1-1 at Milan. Manchester United (4-4-2): Barthez; Irwin, Stam, G Neville, Silvestre; Chadwick, Keane, Butt, Scholes (Greening, 75min); Sheringham, Solskjaer. Sturm Graz (4-4-2): Sidorczuk; Neukircher, Ibertsberger, Fleurquin, Korsos; Schopp, Schupp (Martens, 65), Minavand (Szabics, 46), Mahlic (Hlinka, 46); Haas, Vastic. Referee: V Ivanov (Russia).",

Punishments for over-celebrating a goal will be fewer, with Fifa recognising \"the natural and emotional joy of scoring\". It said celebration would \"only be considered a punishable offence if it borders on provocation or leads to time-wasting.\" Players removing shirts to celebrate a goal will no longer be cautioned. Celtic's midfielder Neil Lennon, who threatened to quit international football after suffering sectarian abuse in Northern Ireland's friendly with Norway, is in the squad for the games this month with the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. N Ireland squad (v Czech Republic, Windsor Park, March 24 and Bulgaria, Sofia, March 28): Carroll (Wigan), Taylor (Fulham); Hughes (Newcastle), Taggart (Leicester), Griffin (Dundee Utd), Murdock (Preston), Williams (Wimbledon), Nolan (Bradford), Kennedy (Watford), Elliott (Motherwell), Lennon (Celtic), Magilton (Ipswich), Jeff Whitley (Man City), McCarthy (Birmingham), Johnson (Blackburn), Healy (Preston), Kirk (Hearts), Gray (Oxford), Ferguson (Linfield), Coote (Norwich). Rep of Ire squad (v Cyprus, Nicosia, March 24 and Andorra, Barcelona, March 28): A Kelly (Blackburn), Given (Newcastle), Kiely (Charlton), G Kelly (Leeds), Staunton (Aston Villa), Harte (Leeds), Breen (Coventry), Dunne (Man City), Cunningham (Wimbledon), Doherty (Tottenham), Roy Keane (Man Utd), Kinsella (Charlton), Carsley (Coventry), McAteer (Blackburn), Holland (Ipswich), Kilbane (Sunderland), Finnan (Fulham), Delap (Derby), Duff (Blackburn), Quinn (Sunderland), Robbie Keane (Leeds), Connolly (Feyenoord).",

Pat Flynn's sculptural conceit of bringing the pixilated approximations of computer games to life proves that what we accept as an asteroid on a VDU screen could equally well signify the deposits of a huge cyber-elephant. Yuen Fong Ling's installation indicative of men at work - a pair of seminar flip-charts disgorging reams of unfilled paper - eloquently illustrates the arguments linking the movie and artistic responses together. A nice idea on paper, but ultimately Deliverance fails to deliver. Until March 31. Details: 0113-283 3130.",

Yet in some ways her physicality can limit her - the more energy she devotes to projecting her sound, the less effect her exertions have. </p> <p>The programme opened with the first movement of Bach's Sonata No 4, which was played with a quiet intensity by Midori, whose long phrases, artfully ornamented, hung suspended as Robert McDonald's seamless accompaniment unfurled around them. It was the first and third movements, both of them slow, restrained and aria-like, that showed her playing at its best, while McDonald came into his own in the complex imitative exchanges of the second. For the final allegro movement the familiar Midori returned, swaying forward and backward, braced against her violin, hair flying. Yet for all her efforts her lines failed to sing out as before, and her playing sounded tense and constrained. </p> <p>Beethoven's Sonata No 10 in G opened in an atmosphere of warm serenity. In the second movement in particular we had another chance to admire the control with which Midori can play quietly - it takes nerve for a string player to sustain such soft, smooth notes for so long without allowing a ripple of disturbance. However, louder passages of the scherzo and finale found her tone treading the fine line between fullness and harshness - all too often coming down on the wrong side. </p> <p>Midori's and McDonald's aptitude for seamless, expansive phrasing came to the fore in the rarity of the evening, the Sonata in B minor by Respighi, a composer remembered largely for a handful of orchestral works. The first two movements had a rhapsodic quality to them; although the first peaked too soon, the second showed Respighi's lyricism burgeoning. The third, an involved set of variations, though taxing on both players, was persuasively performed. </p> <p>Preceding the Respighi, an arrangement of Schubert's Valse-Caprice No 6 showed Midori bringing her technical precision to a lighter piece. Her performance was certainly adept, yet sober and well-behaved. The seriousness and energy with which she throws herself into her playing sometimes leaves the impression that she is fighting against her instrument.

      "body": "<p>Agnes Martin is a pilgrim, with her eyes wide open to the desert vistas, to the sky, to the sun. Since 1967, this Canadian-born 89-year-old painter has lived in seclusion in New Mexico. Like Georgia O'Keeffe before her, she has found calm and some deep sense of beauty there. It radiates from her paintings in a way that is at first hard to assimilate amid the noise and rain of London's Oxford Street. </p> <p>Here are paintings that disdain pomp and theatre. Square canvases, mapped out in horizontal bands of pale colour: salmon pink, lemon yellow, eggshell blue, pretty colours alternating with strips of white, for all the world like designs on a beach umbrella in a turn-of-the-century coastal resort. Rather than the desert, these paintings made me think at first of Monet, or the Gilded Age charm of an Edith Wharton novel. </p> <p>Then you move in close, and the power of Agnes Martin hits you. Martin is an artist not of colour, but of texture. She made her name in New York in the early 1960s with paintings whose muted monochrome appearance was enriched by a passionate graphite labour as she pencilled straight-ruled, but haphazardly and humanly executed, grids across the surface. The same happens here. Seen close to, the bands of colour are bounded by pencilled lines that wobble, jerk, but finally reach their goal on the other side of the canvas. There's something vulnerable about it, and this is true of the paint too, as you realise it is anything but a smooth expanse of colour. It is uneven, at one point opaque, at another like cotton wool, and the canvas's grain ruffles the plane of colour. </p> <p>This is Martin's originality, to look into the same grand empty space as the American abstract expressionist painters before her, those macho prophets, but to record her vision in an altogether more practical way. Her paintings insist on the material fact of painting - the paint caught in the weft of the canvas divided by those carefully pencilled lines. Martin's art seems to go to the heart of American history. She is both the pilgrim and the frontierswoman, and her attraction to the big empty spaces is paid for with a religious sense of responsibility to craft. Martin's paintings have the simplicity of a Shaker chair, and their discipline and calm make you envy the artist, out there in the light and space of the west, as you emerge again onto Oxford Street. </p> <p>Until April 6.

But watching Neil Bartlett's svelte adaptation of Robin Maugham's play and novella, I can't help feeling that much of the juice has been drained from the myth and that the famous 1963 Pinter-Losey film remains the definitive version. </p> <p>Like Pinter, Bartlett sets the action in the early 1960s and the transposition proves crucial. Maugham's original 1948 novella shows a rich toff destroyed by a diabolical prole and is, among other things, a fable about the dangers of postwar socialism. Set it in the 1960s, however, and the focus shifts towards the moral collapse of an effete upper class. The master, Tony, rejects his fiancee, Sally, in favour of his servant, Barrett, precisely because the latter insulates him from the outside world and provides \"warmth, comfort and food\". As this new version makes crystal clear, Barrett also supplies the juvenile rough trade that his master desperately craves: first in the shape of the under-age Vera and then in the form of a male tart called Mabel. </p> <p>I wouldn't deny the story has a lurid interest, but the myth is now beginning to look a shade threadbare. For a start, Tony himself doesn't fall from a very great height. Faust has his appetites and Dorian Gray his beauty, but Tony is simply a pampered wimp who allows himself to drift into Barrett's clutches through moral inertia. And, although Bartlett's version highlights Tony's sexual ambivalence, it neither lends the action a plausible economic context (is Tony's private income inexhaustible?) nor rids it entirely of melodrama. </p> <p>The image of Barrett gloating on the stairs is uncomfortably close to Maugham's Grand Guignol vision of the servant as a slimy reptile whose body \"was green and horrible in the moonlight\". </p> <p>What one can still enjoy is the acting and Bartlett's own directorial grace notes. Jack Davenport makes a virtue of Tony's absence of character, suggesting an emotionally arrested public schoolboy who will let the world go hang as long as he gets his daily supply of muffins and tarts. </p> <p>Despite the melodramatic overtones, Michael Feast also turns Barrett into a slippery chameleon and shrewd analyst of upper- class weakness. There's a key moment, in his second coming, when he fractionally pauses before handing Tony a whisky tumbler as if he knows his master is once more his plaything. And Emma Amos as Tony's spurned fiancee and Zoe Telford as Barrett's piece of jailbait both suggest a deep class antagonism. It's a briskly entertaining production well designed by Rae Smith. But where Bartlett's earlier revivals of Rattigan and Somerset Maugham have yielded rare riches, here you feel a familiar tale of old Chelsea is simply being retold with added sexual spice. </p> <p> Until April 21.
