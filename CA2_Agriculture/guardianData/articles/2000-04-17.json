As a result, the police found nothing to implicate any player, member of management or match official in match fixing.

Kheterpal, Lewis alleged, then promised him \u00a31m to help fix the New Zealand series, and suggested that he offered \u00a3300,000 each to Alec Stewart and Alan Mullally to underperform. </p> <p>\"I nearly fell off my chair in shock when he told me who the names were,\" Lewis said. \"The amounts the three received ran into thousands.

      "body": "<p>Barely two weeks ago, before their Champions League encounter with Chelsea, the Catalan champions were being hailed as the best team in Europe, if not the world. If their current form continues, they will have a fight on their hands to stay the best team in Barcelona. </p> <p>In a nightmare 11 days Barcelona have lost four times, conceding three goals on each occasion with only Luis Figo's goal at Stamford Bridge to their credit. It is as if the former Champions League favourites have given up winning for Lent.</p> <p>Saturday's humiliation was at the hands of the relegation-threatened Real Oviedo and courtesy of a hat-trick by the Panamanian Dely Valdes. Barcelona's challenge for the Spanish league has faded, leaving them five points behind Deportivo La Coruna (and only 11 points ahead of their city neighbours Espanyol). Suddenly, Barcelona's entire season is hanging on tonight's quarter-final, second leg against Gianluca Vialli's side in the Nou Camp.</p> <p>Frank de Boer, one of the numerous Dutch internationals brought to the club by the coach and former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal, made a bleak assessment of the team's predicament even before the weekend's latest defeat. \"We have to be aware of the situation,\" he said. \"We've almost lost everything. To get out of this situation it's better to be realistic.\"</p> <p>The defender is one of the few players with whom Van Gaal has not clashed publicly in recent weeks. Run-ins with the strikers Luis Enrique and Patrick Kluivert and the world footballer of the year Rivaldo have contributed to the atmosphere of discord and disarray that hang about the club.</p> <p>\"The truth is that Van Gaal's relationship with the players could be better, above all at the present time,\" Kluivert was quoted as saying in the Spanish press on Friday.</p> <p>Kluivert's comments came two days after Van Gaal had called a team meeting to stress the importance of discipline. The Dutch coach observed of the above newspaper article that \"a player of his age should know when to speak\". Kluivert was duly dropped for the game against Oviedo.</p> <p>For Chelsea, their 3-1 victory in the first leg was followed by a league win over Leeds United and an FA Cup semi- final victory over Newcastle. For Barcelona, however, in a curious parallel, it was followed with a 3-0 loss at home to Real Mallorca and a Spanish Cup semi-final first-leg defeat by the same score at Atletico Madrid.</p> <p>Barcelona's losing streak has coincided with the injury and subsequent absence of their midfield linchpin, Pep Guardiola, whose influence on the team can be compared to that of Dennis Wise and Chelsea. \"It's obvious we're missing Pep,\" the goalkeeper Ruud Hesp said. \"He has so much individual quality.\"</p> <p>Guardiola came on as a second-half substitute on Saturday and Van Gaal will be keen to pitch him in against Chelsea. \"Only he can help the team,\" said the coach. \"He hasn't trained for eight or nine days and we'll see how long he can last.\"</p> <p>When things were going well for the reigning champions, the fact that Van Gaal had opted to rebuild his Ajax team at the expense of Catalan players such as Albert Ferrer could be overlooked. Barcelona were playing some dazzling football and looked on course for a possible treble. Before the game with Chelsea, they had won their previous nine matches and in some style.</p> <p>But as the team's form has plummeted, the supporters' interest in the players' passports has surfaced once again, fuelled by the rumours that the Catalan left-back, Sergi, could be on his way out in the summer. On internet bulletin boards, the first \"Van Gaal must go!\" messages have appeared.</p> <p>Three consecutive defeats normally constitute a suicide note for the men in charge in Spain, so Van Gaal may already be on borrowed time. But Chelsea would be foolish to underestimate the task facing them tonight.</p> <p>Despite a fortnight from hell that he has admitted is his worst time at the club, Van Gaal remains upbeat. \"After four defeats it's all very disappointing, but I'm going to try to use that disappointment to bounce back against Chelsea. With 100,000 in the Nou Camp anything is possible.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barely two weeks ago, before their Champions League encounter with Chelsea, the Catalan champions were being hailed as the best team in Europe, if not the world. If their current form continues, they will have a fight on their hands to stay the best team in Barcelona. In a nightmare 11 days Barcelona have lost four times, conceding three goals on each occasion with only Luis Figo's goal at Stamford Bridge to their credit. It is as if the former Champions League favourites have given up winning for Lent. Saturday's humiliation was at the hands of the relegation-threatened Real Oviedo and courtesy of a hat-trick by the Panamanian Dely Valdes. Barcelona's challenge for the Spanish league has faded, leaving them five points behind Deportivo La Coruna (and only 11 points ahead of their city neighbours Espanyol). Suddenly, Barcelona's entire season is hanging on tonight's quarter-final, second leg against Gianluca Vialli's side in the Nou Camp. Frank de Boer, one of the numerous Dutch internationals brought to the club by the coach and former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal, made a bleak assessment of the team's predicament even before the weekend's latest defeat. \"We have to be aware of the situation,\" he said. \"We've almost lost everything. To get out of this situation it's better to be realistic.\" The defender is one of the few players with whom Van Gaal has not clashed publicly in recent weeks. Run-ins with the strikers Luis Enrique and Patrick Kluivert and the world footballer of the year Rivaldo have contributed to the atmosphere of discord and disarray that hang about the club. \"The truth is that Van Gaal's relationship with the players could be better, above all at the present time,\" Kluivert was quoted as saying in the Spanish press on Friday. Kluivert's comments came two days after Van Gaal had called a team meeting to stress the importance of discipline. The Dutch coach observed of the above newspaper article that \"a player of his age should know when to speak\". Kluivert was duly dropped for the game against Oviedo. For Chelsea, their 3-1 victory in the first leg was followed by a league win over Leeds United and an FA Cup semi- final victory over Newcastle. For Barcelona, however, in a curious parallel, it was followed with a 3-0 loss at home to Real Mallorca and a Spanish Cup semi-final first-leg defeat by the same score at Atletico Madrid. Barcelona's losing streak has coincided with the injury and subsequent absence of their midfield linchpin, Pep Guardiola, whose influence on the team can be compared to that of Dennis Wise and Chelsea. \"It's obvious we're missing Pep,\" the goalkeeper Ruud Hesp said. \"He has so much individual quality.\" Guardiola came on as a second-half substitute on Saturday and Van Gaal will be keen to pitch him in against Chelsea. \"Only he can help the team,\" said the coach. \"He hasn't trained for eight or nine days and we'll see how long he can last.\" When things were going well for the reigning champions, the fact that Van Gaal had opted to rebuild his Ajax team at the expense of Catalan players such as Albert Ferrer could be overlooked. Barcelona were playing some dazzling football and looked on course for a possible treble. Before the game with Chelsea, they had won their previous nine matches and in some style. But as the team's form has plummeted, the supporters' interest in the players' passports has surfaced once again, fuelled by the rumours that the Catalan left-back, Sergi, could be on his way out in the summer. On internet bulletin boards, the first \"Van Gaal must go!\" messages have appeared. Three consecutive defeats normally constitute a suicide note for the men in charge in Spain, so Van Gaal may already be on borrowed time. But Chelsea would be foolish to underestimate the task facing them tonight. Despite a fortnight from hell that he has admitted is his worst time at the club, Van Gaal remains upbeat. \"After four defeats it's all very disappointing, but I'm going to try to use that disappointment to bounce back against Chelsea. With 100,000 in the Nou Camp anything is possible.\"",

The side will be captained by Colin Hendry of Coventry City, whose team-mate Paul Telfer was called up as a late replacement and made his debut against France. Hendry will need to marshal his troops especially well if Scotland are to give any hint that they are beginning the march towards Japan and South Korea in good stride. Scotland: Douglas (Dundee), Gould (Celtic), Sullivan (Wimbledon), Dailly (Blackburn), Elliott (Leicester), Hendry (Coventry), O'Neil (VfL Wolfsburg), Ritchie (Bolton), Weir (Everton), Burley (Derby), Cameron (Hearts), Davidson (Blackburn), B Ferguson (Rangers), Hutchison (Everton), Johnston (Sunderland), Lambert (Celtic), McNamara (Celtic), Telfer (Coventry), Burchill (Celtic), Dodds (Rangers), Gallacher (Newcastle), McCann (Rangers).",

T-Online is the world's largest internet service provider after America Online. It has 5.3m customers, against AOL's 23m, and is some way ahead of Britain's Freeserve.

The whole thing is exhausting and confusing, and its more than 50 artists do not present us with an overall picture of the state of British art, or a map of its preoccupations. Among it all, in a glass display cabinet in the Dean Gallery, is a simple ceramic pot by the artist Grayson Perry. It's the way that Perry - who doubles as a transvestite called Claire - decorates his pottery that counts. Perry's pots are usually alive with tawdry bacchanals, weird sex, visual puns, people, poo and guns. This particular pot, by contrast, is decorated with a simple glazed list.

On the other hand, the British Art Show does serve to remind us that there is far more going on in the country than the YBA tribe. But do we really care about Britishness, or the next British big thing? The past two decades have made London and Glasgow (in particular) good places to make art. There's a healthy milieu, lots of opportunities to see and be seen. </p> <p>Which brings us to the opening this week of White Cube 2, in London's Hoxton Square, and to the new exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery, Ant Noises, which opens to the public later this week. Already, these exhibitions have overshadowed the larger survey of British art in Edinburgh, because they focus on the collector, the dealer and their artists. It is a neat package. It lets everyone get a handle on the relationship between art and money, it is a tale with lots of gossip and nice images. Off we go. </p> <p>White Cube 2, an extensively remodelled industrial building facing onto the square, is the latest, super-elegant venture of gallerist Jay Jopling. White Cube 2 is an impeccable, museum-quality space, filled with entirely artificial daylight, and a selection of work by the gallery's roster of artists. Commercial galleries are shops, and what we've got here is the full product range. An Antony Gormley Man, a deflated rubber body cast by Marc Quinn (a serendipitous, tragi-comic alignment), Gavin Turk's deathly, ultra-realistic corpse of Che Guevara, who lies in state, in his tattered army fatigues, on what looks like a Rachel Whiteread mortuary slab. It is Gavin-as-Che on a modern art bier. Nude men lounge about in Sam Taylor-Wood's montaged photo-work, which is dominated by a portrait of a blindfolded man. As if there weren't enough talk of death, decrepitude and the drama of the body's plight, there is also a very funny Damien Hirst, which includes a real skeleton. The skeleton floats above the floor on a crucifix of glass sheets. He has ping-pong ball eyes, which jiggle and roll about on air-jets inserted in the empty sockets in the skull. This is a Jim Carrey Christ, with a skeleton's grin. </p> <p>Just because all this stuff intimates mortality doesn't necessarily make it rich as art. The Hirst is only a clever gag - and a reworking, at that, of things he was doing almost a decade ago. We want artists to get better at what they do. They don't always, and developing in public, as so many of Hirst's generation have had to do, doesn't always helped. The market, and the media, wants a constant stream of novelties (as both Harold Rosenberg and Walter Benjamin had already pointed out by the middle of the last century), rather than an increase in creative sophistication or thoughtfulness. More depth and more complexity aren't as sexy or attention-grabbing as ever-wackier objects, more extreme measures. </p> <p>The best things here are Turk's Che and a perfectly executed model of a McDonald's drive-thru burger bar by Jake and Dinos Chapman. The brickwork is stained, the gravel on the flat roof sprouts weeds, the ivy climbing the walls is rank. The interior is deserted. The place is brooding and nasty, corporate, banal and vile. We already know this, of course, but the re-creation focuses the mind on precisely how grim it is. </p> <p>Cerith Wyn Evans's quotation of Gertrude Stein's famous line, \"Before the flowers of friendship faded, friendship faded\", written in a trellis of fireworks high on the wall, seems to acknowledge that the bubble might burst, that fame is transient. Before the flowers of friendship fade, staleness sets in. </p> <p>Jay Jay Jay, Saatchi Damien Tracey. Isn't the constant reiteration of the roll-call unutterably void, without meaning or consequence? Aren't the artists as sick of it as the rest of us? Nowadays, you have to collude with the media or be forgotten, so the story goes. Yet it is difficult not to be seen to collude in the personality game, even while trying to be critical and responsive to the art rather than the personalities, the lifestyles, the gossip and sensationalism. </p> <p>The Saatchi Gallery's latest exhibition, Ant Noises (anag: Sensation), has already had a mountain of coverage, mostly due to Damien Hirst's megaton, half-flayed gigantic man, an anatomical toy blown up 20ft tall and cast in polychromed bronze, which Charles Saatchi has apparently bought for a cool million. Hymn - derived from a Humbrol toy - is a very 80s, post-Duchampian appropriation. It is unavoidably present - on account of its size - but, as one would expect from a scaled-up toy, it has no sense of scale at all, apart from bigness. It is an inert icon, already reproduced everywhere, because it is by Hirst, because it cost an iconic round sum, and because the huge bronze is a borrowed form, rather than one invented by the artist. It fits neatly into the rhetoric of modern art, and supercharges the mythology of artist and patron alike. </p> <p>Icons aren't necessarily inherently interesting, and they aren't necessarily art either. As a thing in itself, Hymn is pretty dull, so much so that it makes you think of all its secondary readings first. Compared, too, with 18th-century wax anatomical models (lifelike men and women, whose guts spill out unnoticed), or the lifesize Transparent or Glass Man, a clear plastic-skinned man produced in the late 20s for a hygiene museum in Dresden, Hirst's man really palls. Hirst's is an economic, rather than plastic, manipulation of the model he took it from. If it were to be placed in a public place - on the vacant plinth in Trafalgar Square, say - it might then start to work rather differently, telling us something about our self-image as ultimately inscrutable biological beings. But here it is only big, a monument to folly. </p> <p>Ant Noises is utterly incoherent. The catalogue (which promises us a part two to the show) has a drivelling essay, written in heady PR-speak by Gemma de Cruz, and the show is unaccountably sponsored by the Independent. Here, Saatchi seems to be saying, are some things I own. What do Rachel Whiteread's 1995 resin-cast spaces under 100 chairs, her homage to Bruce Nauman, have to do with anything else here? Saatchi's latest acquisition from Chris Ofili shows that the collector doesn't always get the good ones, even by good artists. </p> <p>There aren't any good Jenny Savilles, because her paintings are all equally bad. Saville paints acres of female flesh, but hasn't a clue how to render it: her brush just paws about indeterminately, tonally approximating fullness and roundness without actually describing the form or substance of the female body. Her paint is dead, the drawing is lousy. It is all held together by little illustrational tricks, and enlivened by lumbering painterly tics, in an attempt to make the surfaces of her paintings, if not the figures she paints, more lively and believable. Saville's paintings would in every sense be flattened by Lucian Freud's paintings of the voluptuous Sue the Benefit Superviser. </p> <p>But is she as bad as Ron Mueck? Mueck is sentimental and twee. His little disconsolate angel, his huge, glowering self-portrait head, his googling giant babies, are incredibly unsophisticated, in terms of how they manage extreme jumps in scale. Given their ultra-realism, you expect his works to command and occupy the space around them, but his sculptures have no personal space. You just get up close and say ooh-er, and move on. Nor do his figures seem to have much dialogue or drama between one another. His is a purely technical, mawkish realism. So much skill, so little talent for art. This is art as baby food and bedtime stories. </p> <p>It doesn't help the artists to be seen, again and again, in this context; nor does it help viewers engage with current art in any interesting way. Constantly banging on about the Britishness of it all, the home-grown, media-friendly excitement of it all, the gossip and high-life and grooviness of it all, helps no one. Put Mueck next to Charles Ray or Robert Gober (both of whom have used the ultra-realist mode) and his work would die. Put Hirst's Hymn next to Wilder Graves Penfield's 1952 Human Sensory Humunculus and it would fade away, however much it cost, however big it is, whoever bought it. </p> <p>The work with the most presence is the simplest and cheekiest. It is a cast of a woman's lower half, perched on a table, by Sarah Lucas. The vaginal lips have been teased apart and slightly extruded, and a cigarette lodged between them. It is horrible and crude and utterly melancholic. You Know What, from 1998, hit me in the gut. It is crashingly obvious and extremely subtle, abject and throwaway, poetically and metaphorically rich and allusive. </p> <p>It is all a matter of presence, and the possibility of generating meaning. It is all about a certain kind of artistic generosity, which includes dealing with doubt. There's so little doubt here, only products to be consumed, pages to be filled. We need another way of looking at this art, other contexts, by which it will stand or fall. Let's not forget, too, that there are artists who don't depend on Saatchi's patronage, and artists who actively refuse to allow their works to enter his collection, both here and abroad. You have to see through the hype and the art gossip and look at the things people make.

The whole thing is exhausting and confusing, and its more than 50 artists do not present us with an overall picture of the state of British art, or a map of its preoccupations. Among it all, in a glass display cabinet in the Dean Gallery, is a simple ceramic pot by the artist Grayson Perry. It's the way that Perry - who doubles as a transvestite called Claire - decorates his pottery that counts. Perry's pots are usually alive with tawdry bacchanals, weird sex, visual puns, people, poo and guns. This particular pot, by contrast, is decorated with a simple glazed list.

      "body": "<p>Each year the South Bank's showcase of young composers seems to grow in scope and ambition. What began as an initiative by the London Sinfonietta is now a joint venture between eight organisations, and stretches to include sound installations, improvisation sessions, even a film of music for the catwalk. Boundaries are deliberately blurred, recognising the fact that for the generation born in the 70s new music draws upon a wider frame of reference than it has ever done before, and that the London Sinfonietta itself is an ensemble born out of a much narrower concept of radicalism. </p> <p>Whether by being opened out like this State of the Nation manages to be more inclusive, or whether it is just paying lip service to fledgling traditions at the expense of the tradition that is its natural constituency, is another question. More crucially, one wonders if the new music audience is as catholic in its tastes as this year's programme would have us believe, or whether those who turned up for the late-night electro-mix preview of the Hayward Gallery's Sonic Boom exhibition were the same faithful who had attended the more conventional concerts earlier in the day. If not, then maybe boundaries are less transparent than some would like to believe. Perhaps it's not a coincidence that among the pieces I heard over the weekend, the least convincing and most pretentious were those that tried to cross those boundaries, combining live music with film and electronics, for instance, to the disadvantage of all three mediums. </p> <p>It's in the nature of events like this that the indifferent music is likely to outweigh the genuinely worthwhile, though all of the composers will have benefited enormously from hearing their work performed by the expert Sinfonietta players under Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Valade.

      "bodyText": "Each year the South Bank's showcase of young composers seems to grow in scope and ambition. What began as an initiative by the London Sinfonietta is now a joint venture between eight organisations, and stretches to include sound installations, improvisation sessions, even a film of music for the catwalk. Boundaries are deliberately blurred, recognising the fact that for the generation born in the 70s new music draws upon a wider frame of reference than it has ever done before, and that the London Sinfonietta itself is an ensemble born out of a much narrower concept of radicalism. Whether by being opened out like this State of the Nation manages to be more inclusive, or whether it is just paying lip service to fledgling traditions at the expense of the tradition that is its natural constituency, is another question. More crucially, one wonders if the new music audience is as catholic in its tastes as this year's programme would have us believe, or whether those who turned up for the late-night electro-mix preview of the Hayward Gallery's Sonic Boom exhibition were the same faithful who had attended the more conventional concerts earlier in the day. If not, then maybe boundaries are less transparent than some would like to believe. Perhaps it's not a coincidence that among the pieces I heard over the weekend, the least convincing and most pretentious were those that tried to cross those boundaries, combining live music with film and electronics, for instance, to the disadvantage of all three mediums. It's in the nature of events like this that the indifferent music is likely to outweigh the genuinely worthwhile, though all of the composers will have benefited enormously from hearing their work performed by the expert Sinfonietta players under Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Valade. There were some striking exceptions. Alberti Addict, by the 28-year-old Joe Duddell, was confidently shaped, even if its language was an unlikely amalgam - a mixture of Glass, Andriessen and Copland.

In turn they rose to stride to the touchline and remonstrate - with their own team. </p> <p>They were clearly unhappy with its shape, yet West Ham were already a goal to the good, were about to make it two and were facing a Derby side who enjoy the adrenalin charge of flirting with their Premiership status so much that they are reluctant to stray far from the exit. </p> <p>Then there was the sight of Paolo Di Canio arguing vociferously with his team-mate Javier Margas as they left the field at half-time. Trevor Sinclair had to shepherd the Italian away. Even the fight for Intertoto Cup places tends to shorten fuses these days. </p> <p>Fortunately tempers cooled in the dressing room. \"You know what Paolo's like,\" said Harry Rednapp. \"He shouts and carries on but we ignore him and he eventually shuts up. The man's a winner, he's no different in five-a-sides.\" </p> <p>The manager had given him the captaincy and Di Canio responded with some delightful cameos. He could not quite get on the scoresheet but Wanchope had already done the damage. A near-post header and a firm drive struck from amid generous penalty-area space added to his two in midweek against Newcastle. </p> <p>Rednapp wants to keep Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 is plotting to sign Davor Suker but insists that neither will compromise his regard for Wanchope. \"He is so laid-back that people get on his case,\" he said of the criticism this most unorthodox striker has attracted from the club's own fans. \"He's got size and strength and he's difficult to play against.\" </p> <p>Derby, robbed by injury of Georgi Kinkladze's inventiveness and the steadying influence of Horacio Carbonari, could hardly get in a blow before half-time but remembered the seriousness of their position in the second half. </p> <p>With six minutes remaining, Dean Sturridge made up for the disappointment of seeing an earlier effort ruled offside by sweeping home a corner. But unlike Wanchope they failed to find another goal and so Sheffield Wednesday moved to within five points of them. </p> <p><strong> Remaining games: Derby:</strong> <strong> Apr 21</strong> Bradford (a); <strong> Apr 24</strong> Southampton (h); <strong> Apr 29</strong> Tottenham (a); <strong> May 6</strong> Newcastle (h); <strong> May 14</strong> Chelsea (a). </p> <p><strong> West Ham: Apr 22</strong> Coventry (h); <strong> Apr 24</strong> Arsenal (a); <strong> Apr 29 </strong> Middlesbrough (h); <strong> May 6</strong> Sunderland (a); <strong> May 14</strong> Leeds (h).</p>",

Take, as one example, the West Ham bench, who looked as if they were involved in a private contest for Mr Angriest of Upton Park. In turn they rose to stride to the touchline and remonstrate - with their own team. They were clearly unhappy with its shape, yet West Ham were already a goal to the good, were about to make it two and were facing a Derby side who enjoy the adrenalin charge of flirting with their Premiership status so much that they are reluctant to stray far from the exit. Then there was the sight of Paolo Di Canio arguing vociferously with his team-mate Javier Margas as they left the field at half-time. Trevor Sinclair had to shepherd the Italian away. Even the fight for Intertoto Cup places tends to shorten fuses these days. Fortunately tempers cooled in the dressing room. \"You know what Paolo's like,\" said Harry Rednapp. \"He shouts and carries on but we ignore him and he eventually shuts up. The man's a winner, he's no different in five-a-sides.\" The manager had given him the captaincy and Di Canio responded with some delightful cameos. He could not quite get on the scoresheet but Wanchope had already done the damage. A near-post header and a firm drive struck from amid generous penalty-area space added to his two in midweek against Newcastle. Rednapp wants to keep Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 is plotting to sign Davor Suker but insists that neither will compromise his regard for Wanchope. \"He is so laid-back that people get on his case,\" he said of the criticism this most unorthodox striker has attracted from the club's own fans. \"He's got size and strength and he's difficult to play against.\" Derby, robbed by injury of Georgi Kinkladze's inventiveness and the steadying influence of Horacio Carbonari, could hardly get in a blow before half-time but remembered the seriousness of their position in the second half. With six minutes remaining, Dean Sturridge made up for the disappointment of seeing an earlier effort ruled offside by sweeping home a corner. But unlike Wanchope they failed to find another goal and so Sheffield Wednesday moved to within five points of them. Remaining games: Derby: Apr 21 Bradford (a); Apr 24 Southampton (h); Apr 29 Tottenham (a); May 6 Newcastle (h); May 14 Chelsea (a). West Ham: Apr 22 Coventry (h); Apr 24 Arsenal (a); Apr 29 Middlesbrough (h); May 6 Sunderland (a); May 14 Leeds (h).",

Heskey hit Sullivan's legs from a one-on-one created by Hamman, but made no mistake with his second opportunity in the 34th minute. Accelerating on to a pass by Owen, he finished emphatically. </p> <p>Hamman and Owen went close before Heskey headed in a Patrik Berger corner at the near post just past the hour.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair this afternoon hit back at critics who condemned the official visit to Britain of the Russian president-elect, Vladimir Putin. The prime minister ignored Tory and Liberal Democrat claims that the trip was \"premature\" and said the best way to press home the west's concerns about alleged human rights abuses in Chechnya was to \"engage\" in a proper dialogue. Speaking at joint press conference with Mr Putin, who is on his first foreign visit since he was elected president, Mr Blair said the Russian leader wanted a strong relationship with the west and \"talks our language of reform\". Mr Blair said that during their meeting they had discussed a number of issues including the war in Chechnya, economic matters and the forthcoming G8 summit. \"I believe that Vladimir Putin is a leader who is ready to embrace a new relationship with the European Union and the United States, who wants a strong and modern Russia and a strong relationship with the west,\" Mr Blair said. The prime minister said he had discussed with Mr Putin the concerns of human rights groups over the Russian occupation of Chechnya and the brutal way in which the army had dealt with Chechen rebels. Mr Putin said he and Mr Blair had differing views over the Chechen crisis, but stressed that closer relations with the EU was one of his priorities. Earlier, a small but noisy group of protesters gathered outside Downing Street to demonstrate against Mr Putin's visit. At least one demonstrator was taken away in a police van. Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, the leader of the Muslim parliament and one of the protest organisers, said: \"The people are feeling disgusted that once again business is taking precedence over concerns for human rights violations and war crimes. \"We are not against Tony Blair talking to Mr Putin but the rules of engagements have to be clearly defined and laid down. Tony Blair said human rights will be top of the agenda - but we want some firm commitment and some kind of timetable about what precisely is going to happen.\" Another protester, Sarfraz Hedni, said: \"The whole nation is being destroyed and the world community should get up and stop it.\" Members of Amnesty International were also at the demonstration.

More encouragingly, the last few years have also seen a huge increase in quality writing for young people. Writers such as Melvin Burgess and Phillip Pullman are not simply writing bridging books, but novels that stand alone in their own right and deserve to win prizes in any category of fiction. From these books it is no leap at all into the big pond of adult fiction, merely a swallow dive.</p> <h2>Troy by Adele Geras (Scholastic, \u00a314.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504171\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/troy.gif\" alt=\"Troy\" width=\"128\" height=\"181\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>You thought mythology was dull? It isn't in this chunky retelling of the most famous Greek story of the all. Geras takes a below-stairs and strongly female perspective to weave an epic drama that she tells with wit, wisdom and a fresh-minted straightforwardness that reminds the reader of an oral storytelling tradition.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Little Soldier by Bernard Ashley (Orchard, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>The world of the child soldier is evoked in this challenging novel that tells the story of Kaninda, a former rebel soldier in an African war, brought to London as a refugee. But Kaninda is determined never to forget what has happened to him and here he finds a different kind of war going on between street gangs on the Docklands streets. This is one of those rare novels that shows you a familiar world through the eyes of an outsider. A strong, uncompromising book.</p> <h2>Make Lemonade by Virginia Euwer Wolff (Faber Children's Classics, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504172\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2000/10/19/makelemonade.gif\" alt=\"Make lemonade 2\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>How do young women build lives for themselves when struggling in difficult circumstances? What do we mean by friendship and family? Some of the answers can be found in this American novel, a book about free form lives written in a free form verse style. There is something exquisitely delicate, but also very tough, about it as it recounts the relationship between a fourteen-year-old girl desperate to escape the poverty of her upbringing, and the struggling single mother for whom she babysits.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Over Sea, Under Stone by Susan Cooper (Puffin, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>A holiday in Cornwall, an ancient treasure map and a search for lost Arthurian treasure. This is the first book in Cooper's terrific The Dark is Rising fantasy sequence, in which the triumph of good against evil is always in the balance. These are books in which the writing is infused with the wildness of the elements. You can buy all five novels in one volume, which is good value at \u00a311, but the print is a bit on the small side. Better to buy each novel as a singleton.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Northern Lights by Phillip Pullman (Scholastic, \u00a35.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504173\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/17/northernlights.jpg\" alt=\"Northern Lights\" width=\"128\" height=\"203\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Lyra must overcome terror and life-threatening perils in her quest to find a friend who has disappeared. Like a modern more grown-up version of Hans Christian Anderson's The Snow Queen, Pullman's beautiful, sparely written book is a real page-turner that even the most sophisticated adult would find hard to resist. With the help of her friendly daemon, Lyra travels to the dark North, where armoured bears rule the ice and witch queens fly through the frozen skies. A fantasy book to rival the very best, this is the first in the Dark Materials trilogy. We guarantee they'll read the next two, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (Collins, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Whisked from his hobbit hole by Gandalf the Wizard and a band of dwarves, Bilbo Baggins finds himself unwillingly caught up in plans to seize the treasure of Smag, a big and dangerous dragon. Originally published in 1937, this was one of the first fantasy novels, and it stands up well against the modern ones: it may not be as scary, but it has wit in its favour. Older readers will move with ease on to The Lord of the Rings.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Flour Babies by Anne Fine (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Simon and his class are given six-pound bags of flour to look after as though they were real babies. Through this curious school project Simon begins to understand something about the strains of parenthood and why his parents behave as they do.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry by Mildred D. Taylor (Puffin, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>A memory novel set in Mississippi during the 1930s. Cassie, a young black girl, doesn't understand why the farm means so much to her father. Cassie is a really memorable creation, a determined and strong-willed girl who learns to fight for both her family and her principles in a world of racial hatred and destruction.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Final Journey by Gudrun Pausewang (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504174\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/17/finaljourney.gif\" alt=\"The Final Journey\" width=\"128\" height=\"209\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Alice has spent two years hiding in a basement, shielded by her loving family from all knowledge of the Nazi persecution of the Jews. But now they have been discovered, and Alice and her grandfather are in a cattle truck being herded with hundreds of others towards their final destination. Pausewang's remarkable book, surely inspired by the Anne Frank story, is cool and uncompromising, as much about Alice's journey of self-discovery towards adulthood as about the holocaust. Like so much in this novel, your heart cracks at the final image of Alice raising up her arms, unwittingly embracing death.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Nobody should grow up without reading what is perhaps the most famous diary of them all. Written between July 1942 and August 1944, it details the growing pains of a young (13 at the start of the diary) Jewish girl hiding with her family from the Nazis in an Amsterdam attic. The diary ends abruptly: the family were discovered and Frank was sent to a concentration camp, where she died of typhus. It is impossible not to respond to the guilelessness of the writing and the portrait of a young woman so vividly alive for such a short time.</p> <h2>Goodnight Mister Tom by Michelle Magorian</h2> <p>(Puffin, \u00a35.99) Willie is evacuated to the country as Britain is on the brink of war. A sad, deprived child, he slowly begins to thrive under the care of old Tom Oakley. But then his mother summons him back to London. A wonderful, warm book in which the emotion is always beautifully controlled but deeply felt as it charts the mysterious ways of adults and the pain of growing up.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Call of the Wild by Jack London (Puffin, \u00a32.99)</h2> <p>Classic adventure story about Buck, a dog born to luxury who is betrayed and sold as a sledge dog. He escapes captivity to become the leader of a wolf pack.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>River Boy by Tim Bowler (OUP, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504175\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/17/riverboy.jpg\" alt=\"River Boy\" width=\"128\" height=\"196\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"You are not the same person at the end of this book\" was the verdict of the Carnegie judges who awarded Bowler's book the Gold Medal back in 1998. There is something distanced yet intense about Bowler's writing style, as though the ordinariness of everyday life has been lifted into a kind of hyper-reality. And that is what it feels like for Jess, whose grandpa is dying in hospital and who refuses to let go.</p> <h2>Brother in the Land by Robert Swindells (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Swindells's thought-provoking novel deservedly won the Children's Book Award. It is a tough story about Danny, who survives a nuclear holocaust and has to find a way to survive in the most desolate of circumstances.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Friends by Rosa Guy (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>A powerful story about friendship set in New York, where newly arrived West Indian Phyllisia Cathy strikes up a friendship with the dynamic Edith.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504176\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/17/wuthering.gif\" alt=\"Wuthering Heights\" width=\"128\" height=\"216\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Great bleak, romantic novel. Hit your teenage girls with this and they'll never start on Mills &amp; Boon.</p> <h2>Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>Ditto everything said about Wuthering Heights.</p> <h2>The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>A great way in to Sherlock Holmes, the faithful Watson and the dastardly Moriarty.</p> <h2>The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504177\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/17/scarecrows.gif\" alt=\"Scarecrows\" width=\"128\" height=\"207\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Intelligent and menacing novel from another Carnegie award-winner, which tells of a boy and his family brought to the brink of destruction by sinister external forces.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Jacob Have I Loved by Katherine Paterson (Puffin, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>A tale of sibling rivalry between twin sisters Caroline and Louise, seen from the point of view of the latter, who feels that her sister - the elder by just a few minutes - gets everyone's love and attention.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Outsiders by SE Hinton (Collins, \u00a34.50)</h2> <p>Published in 1967 when Hinton was 17, this book became an overnight classic. It captures all the terror and excitement of being an American teenager, which feels here like being a cowboy in the Wild West. The violent ganglands of America was also the setting for another Hinton classic, Rumblefish (Collins, \u00a33.99), the tragic story of Rusty Jones, whose one ambition is to be like his elder brother, Motorcycle Boy.</p> <h2>A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2> <p>The great thing about getting hooked on Dickens is that there are so many of them. In my experience teenagers either love or hate him, and there is absolutely no in between. Puffin also do abridged versions in this series of Great Expectations, Oliver Twist and A Tale of Two Cities. Audiobooks are a good way in - Hugh Laurie does a superb rendition of Great Expectations (Puffin, \u00a37.99).</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Talking in Whispers by James Watson (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504178\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/17/talkinginwhispers.gif\" alt=\"Talking in Whispers\" width=\"128\" height=\"210\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A tense, political thriller set in Chile about an outlawed teenager who flees oppression at the hands of the Junta.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (Arrow, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Harper Lee's great novel about race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s is seen through the eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, two youngsters whose father is a lawyer defending a black man charged with raping a white woman. A really good read, and a wise and compassionate book.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Junk by Melvin Burgess (Penguin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>\"A love affair you'll never forget\" is the promise on the cover of Burgess's brutally honest book about teenage runaways Tar and Gemma - who love each other, and heroin. Burgess doesn't try to hide anything, dress drug addiction up, preach or moralise. He simply writes it as it is from the point of view of 14-year-olds who see all the attractions of heroin and none of the dangers. This isn't an issue book, it is a great novel that you consume in one great adrenaline rush. If you ike this you'll also love Burgess's The Baby and Fly Pie (Puffin, \u00a34.99), a thriller about a group of children living on the streets, and Burning Issy (Hodder, \u00a34.99), a haunting nightmarish tale set in the 17th century when the witchfinder scoured the countryside looking for women to burn.</p> <h2>Dear Nobody by Berlie Doherty (Collins, \u00a34.50)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504179\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2000/04/17/dearnobody.gif\" alt=\"Dear Nobody\" width=\"128\" height=\"210\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Helen and Chris are on the brink of adulthood, and should have been looking forward to starting college. Instead they are coping with the idea of becoming parents. Carnegie Medal award-winning novel that captures all the intensity of teenage first love and its consequences.</p> <h2>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (Puffin, \u00a32.99)</h2> <p>Puffin's slightly abridged version helps bring out the pointed wit of Austen's tale. Some just don't get the point until they are in their 20s, although Colin Firth and co have led to a run on this in households with teenage girls.</p>",

Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte (Puffin, \u00a33.99) Great bleak, romantic novel. Hit your teenage girls with this and they'll never start on Mills &amp; Boon. Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb (Puffin, \u00a33.99) Ditto everything said about Wuthering Heights. The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Puffin, \u00a33.99) A great way in to Sherlock Holmes, the faithful Watson and the dastardly Moriarty. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Intelligent and menacing novel from another Carnegie award-winner, which tells of a boy and his family brought to the brink of destruction by sinister external forces. Jacob Have I Loved by Katherine Paterson (Puffin, \u00a35.99) A tale of sibling rivalry between twin sisters Caroline and Louise, seen from the point of view of the latter, who feels that her sister - the elder by just a few minutes - gets everyone's love and attention. The Outsiders by SE Hinton (Collins, \u00a34.50) Published in 1967 when Hinton was 17, this book became an overnight classic. It captures all the terror and excitement of being an American teenager, which feels here like being a cowboy in the Wild West. The violent ganglands of America was also the setting for another Hinton classic, Rumblefish (Collins, \u00a33.99), the tragic story of Rusty Jones, whose one ambition is to be like his elder brother, Motorcycle Boy. A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (Puffin, \u00a33.99) The great thing about getting hooked on Dickens is that there are so many of them. In my experience teenagers either love or hate him, and there is absolutely no in between. Puffin also do abridged versions in this series of Great Expectations, Oliver Twist and A Tale of Two Cities. Audiobooks are a good way in - Hugh Laurie does a superb rendition of Great Expectations (Puffin, \u00a37.99). Talking in Whispers by James Watson (Puffin, \u00a34.99) A tense, political thriller set in Chile about an outlawed teenager who flees oppression at the hands of the Junta. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee (Arrow, \u00a35.99) Harper Lee's great novel about race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s is seen through the eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, two youngsters whose father is a lawyer defending a black man charged with raping a white woman. A really good read, and a wise and compassionate book. Junk by Melvin Burgess (Penguin, \u00a34.99) \"A love affair you'll never forget\" is the promise on the cover of Burgess's brutally honest book about teenage runaways Tar and Gemma - who love each other, and heroin. Burgess doesn't try to hide anything, dress drug addiction up, preach or moralise. He simply writes it as it is from the point of view of 14-year-olds who see all the attractions of heroin and none of the dangers. This isn't an issue book, it is a great novel that you consume in one great adrenaline rush. If you ike this you'll also love Burgess's The Baby and Fly Pie (Puffin, \u00a34.99), a thriller about a group of children living on the streets, and Burning Issy (Hodder, \u00a34.99), a haunting nightmarish tale set in the 17th century when the witchfinder scoured the countryside looking for women to burn. Dear Nobody by Berlie Doherty (Collins, \u00a34.50) Helen and Chris are on the brink of adulthood, and should have been looking forward to starting college. Instead they are coping with the idea of becoming parents. Carnegie Medal award-winning novel that captures all the intensity of teenage first love and its consequences. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (Puffin, \u00a32.99) Puffin's slightly abridged version helps bring out the pointed wit of Austen's tale. Some just don't get the point until they are in their 20s, although Colin Firth and co have led to a run on this in households with teenage girls.",

But, quietly, a very different kind of campaign has been fought between the groups' Sunday titles, and the latest news from the front tells a very interesting story indeed. </p> <p>It would appear that the Sunday Mirror, which had grown used to being in a state of seemingly perpetual decline, has been enjoying a period of stability unknown for several years. Meanwhile, the triumphant News of the World, long the favoured red-top among the masses, has been suffering from the kind of reverse which is making it harder week after week to maintain its 4m-plus sale. </p> <p>As the chart detailing the latest officially audited figures from ABC shows, the gap between the two remains immense. I would be surprised if News of the World editor Phil Hall is overly worried just now. But that shouldn't detract from the achievement of his rival, Colin Myler, at the Sunday Mirror.

      "bodyText": "The great battle between News International and Trinity-Mirror is usually viewed through the daily skirmishes between the Sun and the Mirror. But, quietly, a very different kind of campaign has been fought between the groups' Sunday titles, and the latest news from the front tells a very interesting story indeed. It would appear that the Sunday Mirror, which had grown used to being in a state of seemingly perpetual decline, has been enjoying a period of stability unknown for several years. Meanwhile, the triumphant News of the World, long the favoured red-top among the masses, has been suffering from the kind of reverse which is making it harder week after week to maintain its 4m-plus sale. As the chart detailing the latest officially audited figures from ABC shows, the gap between the two remains immense. I would be surprised if News of the World editor Phil Hall is overly worried just now. But that shouldn't detract from the achievement of his rival, Colin Myler, at the Sunday Mirror. Everyone knows that trying to reverse a downward trend is infinitely more difficult than holding a paper steady on course when it's at the top of the market. An analysis of Sunday Mirror circulation over the past couple of years shows a clear upward trend. It has slowed the rate of decline which from July to September 1998 was running at 15% year-on-year, to barely 1% in the past three months.

It is important to note that the NoW is nothing like as reliant on bulk sales as the Sunday Mirror and discounts proportionately fewer copies too, but Myler's performance is surprising all the same. So how has he done it? By editorial content or promotions? By marketing or journalism? Last week, for example, did readers buy the paper because of the \"world exclusive\" on Barbara Windsor's secret wedding - picked up, incidentally from the New of the World's first edition - or because there was a free Pok\u00e9mon poster on offer?

For anyone still scarred by the Metro, it's proof that small is sexy. </p> <p>Some limits, however, call into question its ability to blood the Merc A-class's nose. The third seat in the back will be an optional extra while, up front, the gearstick is a little close to the passenger seat and could lead to accidental groping. Storage is adequate and the dash is skinned in a pleasant, grippy surface that prevents phone slippage on most corners.

The petrol version falls flat a little in third and is no lunger, but the diesel is a tremendously thrilling alternative. It has so much torque in any gear, at any time, that you'd be barmy to buy September's petrol option, and should wait for the new year for the TDI. The diesel does make a bit of a racket because Audi's quest for low weight led them to omit the same degree of soundproofing (so saving a fiver on build costs). But after the chorus of groans from media guinea pigs, they say they will be coughing up the cash and muffling the thing.

Fortunately the Guardian photographer arrives for the afternoon, a very nice, calm man, whose presence makes us both behave ourselves.

I keep hearing Tom's voice telling me what I'm doing wrong, but once I've let go of that the driving is fine - things click. But I still fail the test on six counts: it's well and truly dawned on me that I'm going to fail again tomorrow. </p> <p> <strong> Friday </strong> I think we both feel a bit guilty for getting in such a snit yesterday. When Tom comes to pick me up this morning, he decides to take me off to the Welsh hills for a little run. The roads are beautiful - magical valleys and wonderful views, and my driving improves exponentially, the gears gliding up and down until I start to feel like Mika Hakkinen.

Tom waves me off, looking as nervous as I feel (I hope I don't let him down), and for the first five minutes, things seem OK. And then disaster strikes: one of my classic lurching gear changes means I lose control for a second. It's only a second, but that's long enough.

Congress has yet to approve the US administration's request for the money it will need to pay America's share of the debt-reduction programme being promoted by the World Bank and the IMF. Did anybody see any humour in the protests? Asked if any of the protest slogans had caught his eye, Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, said: \"There were two slogans, 'Death to capitalism', which is a large subject all by itself, and 'Down with Red Meat.' Of course,there is no connection in my mind between the two.\" Useful links Mobilisation of Global Justice International Monetary Fund World Bank Larry Elliott on the IMF",

Chief executive Richard Findlay met Corley over a pint and the Border boss agreed to take the offer to his board. But Border's directors refused to entertain the bid and Scottish Radio, which had failed in a takeover approach to Border two years earlier, went hostile. </p> <p>In a relatively short time, Border has built a valuable portfolio of radio assets which account for 40% of group revenues, up from 20% two years ago.

In a bow to the sensibilities of the new Scottish parliament, Border began splitting frequencies between England and Scotland to offer opt-outs in local programming. </p> <p>Local newspaper business CN Group has demonstrated an admirable lack of dewy eyes. It has committed its 14% stake to Capital, as has Scudder Threadneedle Investments, which has around 7%.

Over the past six months or so, the amount of money allegedly being demanded by the actors has spiralled. The latest rumour, kicked off by the Hollywood Reporter newspaper and picked up by the tabloids here, has the cast demanding a staggering $1m per episode for the next series - a pretty steep price tag for twentysomething eye candy, even by US television standards. At the moment, they receive a paltry $95,000 per show. If they didn't get their way, the reports said, the cast would walk out and the show would be no more. </p> <p>It is a feeding frenzy which shows no sign of abating - and, whether the studios like it or not, it does the show's popularity no harm. Nor is it just Friends: virtually all the top-rated TV shows in the US are the subject of wild stories in the showbiz papers, keeping their profile high and the viewing figures even higher. The future of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder on the X Files is the subject of intense speculation, and there is the added spice of his lawsuit against the studio which makes the cult sci-fi show, Fox. </p> <p>But Friends tops the rumour pack: its hot combination of sexy stars and off-screen drama is too good to miss. </p> <p>The studios deny that they have any hand in stirring the stories, which began at the start of the autumn season last September. The stars were signed up to a five-year deal which is now coming to a close with the current series. Warner Brothers, which makes the show, is desperate to conclude a deal - it is watched in 50 countries and has made $1bn in repeat fees in the US. NBC, which broadcasts Friends in the US and pays $5m an episode to Warner for the privilege, is also under intense pressure: it is to showcase its new autumn schedule to advertisers in New York on May 15, and if Friends is not part of the portfolio, it stands to lose out in advertising revenue. </p> <p>Cynthia Littleton, the television editor of the Hollywood Reporter and author of the story which so incensed Schwimmer, says that the interest in the Friends negotiations is insatiable. Like the Ford workers' pay round in Britain during the 1970s, the Friends deal will set the standard to which actors on other shows will aspire. \"All eyes are on the Friends renewal negotiations at the moment because it is such a hot show. What the Friends cast makes will set a new industry benchmark. I'm sure they will see their salaries double or triple.\" </p> <p>As the deadline approaches, the stories get wilder. Low-level public relations officers, agents and studio hangers-on all claim to know the latest twist. But Littleton believes that the senior studio executives are feeling the pressure. \"Knowing the people at Warner that I do, I think they would like nothing more than a moratorium on these stories. The more we write, the tenser the negotiations become. It is at a very sensitive stage, and they are in a fishbowl.\" </p> <p>Joe Adalian, the television editor at rival magazine Variety, believes that the gossip is being perpetrated by a lot of people who claim to have an inside track, but have little real insight. \"There is a lot of buzz out there, but there are a lot of people who don't know anything,\" he says. </p> <p>But he concedes that practitioners of the black arts of public relations frequently have a hand in leaking stories to suit their own agenda. A network may want to play down the amount of money it is paying for a particular show; while an agency might want to ratchet up the value of one of its stars. \"Everyone has a different agenda.\" </p> <p>Such practices are not just confined to the US, however. Channel 4 and Sky One are the principal rivals to show the series in Britain - it currently gets a first airing on the satellite channel - and each is happy to sling off-the-record mud at the other. And when Nicky Campbell was in negotiations with the BBC to join the Newsnight programme, the deal was spun out of all proportion by his own public relations machine. Unsourced stories began to appear suggesting that the former disc jockey was to become a regular presenter, when in the end he simply presented a few audience debates. </p> <p>As the Friends negotiation nears its climax, it seems certain that the stories will get ever-more fanciful. But Littleton is convinced that such is the value of the show to Warner and NBC that a deal is certain to be concluded. \"They want to keep the series going and they know they are going to have to do it one way or another.\" Knowing the strength of their situation, the Friends stars' negotiators are tightening the screws. \"The lawyers are being very savvy, as the clock ticks.

      "body": "<p>On Friday, Labour peer Clive Hollick was finally summoned across the Thames to the ugly hulk of the Competition Commission in central London. Flanked by his top TV executives, he gave evidence on what everyone acknowledges is the landmark media test case of the year. His aim, naturally, was to persuade the panel of the sheer \"win-win\" logic behind the merger of his United News &amp; Media with Carlton, proposed last November. </p> <p>This \u00a38.3bn deal would, remember, create a dominant ITV player - six contiguous ITV franchises from Nottingham to Cornwall, in the south, west, east and centre of England. A prize indeed. </p> <p>Behind closed doors, Hollick was bound to seize the chance to put across his vision of breaking with what he sees as the frustratingly parochial, tribal and divided heritage of ITV. So it could punch its weight - under his direction naturally - in new media, on the world stage, just like the BBC. </p> <p>As if there wasn't enough at stake already, Charles Allen of Granada, the third big force in ITV, muscled onto the pitch on January 8 with an enigmatic statement indicating that the company was minded to bid for either Carlton or United. Since then silence has fallen. The commission is taking the two merger proposals together, will grill Granada in May, but has yet to receive its fleshed-out case. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the media industry is in turmoil. The outcome affects shareholdings in Channel 5, maybe GMTV, ITN, and the commercial interests of Channel 4, Flextech, BSkyB, OnDigital and the BBC. </p> <p>But Hollick and Carlton's Michael Green as well as Allen are running smack up against two existing rules governing media concentration - at a delicate moment when a government white paper on communications and media ownership is being drafted for publication later this year. </p> <p>One restricts any company to 15% of the total TV audience, and cannot be relaxed without new legislation. (In fact the two players can comply with it fairly easily.) Sophisticates Hollick and Green don't want to frighten the horses with talk of one ITV just yet: they are now arguing for a carved up \"bi-polar\" ITV, with Granada as a northern counterweight; an argument which, sources say, senior government figures seem inclined to listen to. The second, less robust restriction, the current focus of immense lobbying, imposes a 25% limit on the share of all TV advertising by any one owner. </p> <p>The merger was referred to the commission in January: the report is to be completed on June 16. Some time in July, nine months after the deal surfaced, Hollick and Green should get their answer from trade secretary Stephen Byers - unless he decides (as with the current Vivendi/BSkyB inquiry) to sit on it. </p> <p>Ten days ago the commission published a formal letter, setting out the issues it was addressing. It is fair to say that the document is providing comfort to all sides, especially a section floating the possibility of making 5% incremental rises to the 25% ceiling, thereby creating a device to allow some further concentration of ownership. </p> <p>Much of March was devoted to ad industry lobbyists preparing and giving evidence. The commission has written to scores of agencies and advertisers. The advertisers, source of ITV's annual \u00a31.8bn income, are the most obviously affected because the deal blatantly breaches the 25% undertaking (a United/Carlton merger would add up to a whopping 36%) and could spawn a monopoly reintroducing the power of the TV companies. </p> <p>The IPA opposes the deal, but the advertisers, through their trade body, ISBA, are implacably hostile - and Hollick and Green failed to win them over during a month of intense wooing over the New Year. </p> <p>Bob Wootton of ISBA says: \"We at ISBA routinely seek meetings with the broadcasters. The trouble is, when you are used to being cold-shouldered, and then they are all over you like a rash, so very keen to persuade you of the siren benefits of their deal to UK media, my God, you think, 'they want it, but what's in it for us?' We had more contact with them in a week than we normally have over a year.\" A meeting in which Lord Hollick rhapsodised about leveraging from ITV into new media didn't help. \"We were deeply suspicious,\" says Wootton. \"We're rooted in the present.\" </p> <p>Jim Marshall of the IPA adds this perspective: \"ITV had an appalling 1990s, only salvaged in the last two years by [ex-chief executive] Richard Eyre. ITV was run by accountants in the 1990s. They made a hash of programming. There's a real issue here. Is a United News &amp; Media with Carlton an attractive proposition? Will ITV forget about programming again? You need stability. Neither United nor Carlton are impressive programme suppliers.\" </p> <p>The merger explains United and Carlton's efforts to talk up the value of their programming: it's why Carlton's production director Lord (Waheed) Alli was trumpeting its adaptation of The Railway Children in last week's Media Guardian, and enthusing about his plan to bring back Crossroads. </p> <p>Why? Because the contribution of the two companies to ITV's schedule is dwarfed by the input of Granada, which makes 50% of networked programmes. Whether or not this is a \"legacy\" of the past, as United insists, the advertisers' instincts are correct: ITV would not function without Granada. So the would-be merger partners argue that Granada's big programme business should be factored into any assessment of network dominance. </p> <p>\"It's not so much about what share they have of ITV advertising, it's about control of ITV. We currently have a reasonable balance that works quite well.\" Marshall adds what a great many are thinking: \"Everyone expected ITV to reduce to two [big companies]. But not quite yet.\" </p> <p>And that's the crux. The regulators who police the rules know there is going to be change, and so do the merchant bankers who factor deals. The radio industry has big groups like GWR breathing fire because they are bang up against separate media concentration rules.

Should jumping the gun be a legitimate way of forcing de facto changes in public policy, before a full review conducted by parliament? </p> <p>Last week, the ITC gave its formal response, asserting that the parliamentary process was \"the most secure basis\" for change. Yet it too sat on the fence, noting that it has been \"clear for some time that the pressure for more radical concentration of channel three ownership would grow\". Then the key point: \"At this stage is it not easy to see how a convincing case could be made for increasing the present maximum percentage [of advertising share] from 25% to as much as 40%\". It dubs this a \"significant relaxation\". Brave leadership this was not. </p> <p> Another key to the Competition Commission's decision is its view of how important ITV is. When the ad sales limit was set in 1994, ITV took 74% of all television advertising. Now it is down to 60%. By 2003, the share will have declined further, to perhaps 57%. Channel 4 has told the Commission that the 25% threshold is right and 40%, \"far too high\". But it could probably live with 30%. </p> <p>At the heart of this debate is whether ITV is still special, providing unique mass-market access. The advertisers say its strength is that it is the only channel which can reach three quarters of the population within a week, while using a combination of other channels would take three weeks. Where else, they ask, would you advertise the News of the World on a Saturday? </p> <p>Among the debates going on behind closed doors is whether, in a world where AOL/Time Warner and Pearson/Bertelsmann have merged, a United-Carlton combination will become a home-grown champion. One of commercial TV's top executives snorted with indignation at the suggestion: \"Strong players! They were tiddlers before, tiddlers afterwards. And the moment ITV becomes one nice neat channel is the moment it will be bought up by a big European player. </p> <p>\"The arguments about it being necessary to prepare British media companies for the world stage is total baloney.

      "bodyText": "On Friday, Labour peer Clive Hollick was finally summoned across the Thames to the ugly hulk of the Competition Commission in central London. Flanked by his top TV executives, he gave evidence on what everyone acknowledges is the landmark media test case of the year. His aim, naturally, was to persuade the panel of the sheer \"win-win\" logic behind the merger of his United News &amp; Media with Carlton, proposed last November. This \u00a38.3bn deal would, remember, create a dominant ITV player - six contiguous ITV franchises from Nottingham to Cornwall, in the south, west, east and centre of England. A prize indeed. Behind closed doors, Hollick was bound to seize the chance to put across his vision of breaking with what he sees as the frustratingly parochial, tribal and divided heritage of ITV. So it could punch its weight - under his direction naturally - in new media, on the world stage, just like the BBC. As if there wasn't enough at stake already, Charles Allen of Granada, the third big force in ITV, muscled onto the pitch on January 8 with an enigmatic statement indicating that the company was minded to bid for either Carlton or United. Since then silence has fallen. The commission is taking the two merger proposals together, will grill Granada in May, but has yet to receive its fleshed-out case. Meanwhile, the media industry is in turmoil. The outcome affects shareholdings in Channel 5, maybe GMTV, ITN, and the commercial interests of Channel 4, Flextech, BSkyB, OnDigital and the BBC. But Hollick and Carlton's Michael Green as well as Allen are running smack up against two existing rules governing media concentration - at a delicate moment when a government white paper on communications and media ownership is being drafted for publication later this year. One restricts any company to 15% of the total TV audience, and cannot be relaxed without new legislation. (In fact the two players can comply with it fairly easily.) Sophisticates Hollick and Green don't want to frighten the horses with talk of one ITV just yet: they are now arguing for a carved up \"bi-polar\" ITV, with Granada as a northern counterweight; an argument which, sources say, senior government figures seem inclined to listen to. The second, less robust restriction, the current focus of immense lobbying, imposes a 25% limit on the share of all TV advertising by any one owner. The merger was referred to the commission in January: the report is to be completed on June 16. Some time in July, nine months after the deal surfaced, Hollick and Green should get their answer from trade secretary Stephen Byers - unless he decides (as with the current Vivendi/BSkyB inquiry) to sit on it. Ten days ago the commission published a formal letter, setting out the issues it was addressing. It is fair to say that the document is providing comfort to all sides, especially a section floating the possibility of making 5% incremental rises to the 25% ceiling, thereby creating a device to allow some further concentration of ownership. Much of March was devoted to ad industry lobbyists preparing and giving evidence. The commission has written to scores of agencies and advertisers. The advertisers, source of ITV's annual \u00a31.8bn income, are the most obviously affected because the deal blatantly breaches the 25% undertaking (a United/Carlton merger would add up to a whopping 36%) and could spawn a monopoly reintroducing the power of the TV companies. The IPA opposes the deal, but the advertisers, through their trade body, ISBA, are implacably hostile - and Hollick and Green failed to win them over during a month of intense wooing over the New Year. Bob Wootton of ISBA says: \"We at ISBA routinely seek meetings with the broadcasters. The trouble is, when you are used to being cold-shouldered, and then they are all over you like a rash, so very keen to persuade you of the siren benefits of their deal to UK media, my God, you think, 'they want it, but what's in it for us?' We had more contact with them in a week than we normally have over a year.\" A meeting in which Lord Hollick rhapsodised about leveraging from ITV into new media didn't help. \"We were deeply suspicious,\" says Wootton. \"We're rooted in the present.\" Jim Marshall of the IPA adds this perspective: \"ITV had an appalling 1990s, only salvaged in the last two years by [ex-chief executive] Richard Eyre. ITV was run by accountants in the 1990s. They made a hash of programming. There's a real issue here. Is a United News &amp; Media with Carlton an attractive proposition? Will ITV forget about programming again? You need stability. Neither United nor Carlton are impressive programme suppliers.\" The merger explains United and Carlton's efforts to talk up the value of their programming: it's why Carlton's production director Lord (Waheed) Alli was trumpeting its adaptation of The Railway Children in last week's Media Guardian, and enthusing about his plan to bring back Crossroads. Why? Because the contribution of the two companies to ITV's schedule is dwarfed by the input of Granada, which makes 50% of networked programmes. Whether or not this is a \"legacy\" of the past, as United insists, the advertisers' instincts are correct: ITV would not function without Granada. So the would-be merger partners argue that Granada's big programme business should be factored into any assessment of network dominance. \"It's not so much about what share they have of ITV advertising, it's about control of ITV. We currently have a reasonable balance that works quite well.\" Marshall adds what a great many are thinking: \"Everyone expected ITV to reduce to two [big companies]. But not quite yet.\" And that's the crux. The regulators who police the rules know there is going to be change, and so do the merchant bankers who factor deals. The radio industry has big groups like GWR breathing fire because they are bang up against separate media concentration rules. Last week the Radio Authority's newish chairman and chief executive effectively said they were waiting to see what the Competition Commission said, and the government's reaction, to divine what degree of future media concentration is deemed politically acceptable. But the sheer nerve of the ITV players still shocks hardened rivals. Should jumping the gun be a legitimate way of forcing de facto changes in public policy, before a full review conducted by parliament?

      "body": "<p>Flagships do not set sail alone. Other vessels are needed before battle can be successfully joined. So when a commentator refers to the Today programme as Radio 4's flagship, the rest of us are not downhearted. There is still plenty of work to be done when Messrs Humphrys and Naughtie traipse past the World at One's morning meeting on their way to breakfast, and a day (as I imagine it) of gentle relaxation preparing for fatherhood or spent in a box at the Royal Opera House. </p> <p>Indeed, the World at One offers its presenter many professional and personal advantages. Being able to sleep through the dawn chorus is one obvious benefit: at 6am, I can still growl at the radio through my stubble, rather than attempting to frame thoughtful and coherent sentences in the studio.</p> <p>Less selfishly, there is a real sense of teamwork and common purpose involved in devising, constructing and delivering a programme in the space of a few hours - without the pre-planning of an overnight production team like the Today Programme. It is an intense and concentrated experience. </p> <p>The World at One is the programme most people turn to for a proper review - in the middle of the news day - of all the relevant facts, in order to hold politicians and others to account; rather as a barrister might build up a case, drawing on expert witnesses where necessary. </p> <p>On a typical day last week, we dissected the decision not to site a \u00a3500m science project in the north-west of England - and also the Foreign Office efforts to persuade Premier Oil to pull out of Burma. In both cases, the minister responsible was then subjected to forensic questioning on the basis of the evidence, very much in the Robin Day tradition. </p> <p>This sequential approach is highly satisfying. The Today Programme - needing to serve an audience which changes frequently over three hours - is bound to be far more episodic. </p> <p>It also has to look ahead to the coming day, which sometimes allows ministers to discuss the principles behind a policy initiative before the details have been released. They can then fall back on that stock defensive phrase: \"You wouldn't expect me to answer that until parliament has been informed...\" </p> <p>By lunchtime, it has become much clearer which of the diary stories deserve further investigation, but our approach does not endear us to political planners and strategists. They have their own agendas which do not invariably coincide with ours. The man we now know to be Alastair Campbell - PMOS to his friends (Prime Minister's official spokesman) - regards any approach by the World at One as inherently malign. Lobby correspondents who raise questions in Downing Street on our behalf are likely to be greeted with laughter: \"That sounds like another piece of Wato nonsense,\" would be an unusually polite response. (Wato is our everyday acronym: it rhymes, more or less, with Bertie Wooster's \"What Ho!\" It was Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's erstwhile sidekick, who once amended the acronym to read \"Wankers at One\", and I still have the T-shirt to prove it.) </p> <p>Needless to say, Campbell has not rushed to proffer the Prime Minister for interview on our programme. Although I spoke to Tony Blair frequently before the election, I have been vouchsafed just one interview since May 1997. </p> <p>And therein lies a tale. Adopting our normal approach, we thought we should decide our own news priorities each day of the 1997 campaign, and matters came to a head over the issue of air traffic. At the first hint that Labour in government might decide to carry out a Tory plan to privatise Britain's air traffic control system, we despatched a reporter in pursuit of Andrew Smith, the shadow minister who had so forcefully - and so recently - declared that Labour would never do any such thing. </p> <p>The subsequent broadcast outraged Campbell and helped to define what has remained, ever since, a highly charged relationship with Downing Street. Hostilities break out sporadically. In July 1998, for example, the PMOS was writing to the Times, explaining why some ministers were opting for \"Sofa TV\" such as Richard and Judy in preference to programmes like Today, Newsnight and the World at One. \"Very few people take the World at One seriously,\" he said, \"so regular appearances by ministers are unlikely.\" </p> <p>In the event, hardly a day goes by without the appearance of one - or more - ministers on World at One. Daily newspapers monitor our output assiduously, and we have even inspired cartoonists such as Matt and Steve Bell. So we continue to worry away at the stories we think are important, whatever efforts are made to deflect us, because that's what listeners say they want. The award from the Voice of the Listener and Viewer suggests we're on the right track, even if Alastair Campbell is never likely to vote for me.</p>",

Less selfishly, there is a real sense of teamwork and common purpose involved in devising, constructing and delivering a programme in the space of a few hours - without the pre-planning of an overnight production team like the Today Programme. It is an intense and concentrated experience. The World at One is the programme most people turn to for a proper review - in the middle of the news day - of all the relevant facts, in order to hold politicians and others to account; rather as a barrister might build up a case, drawing on expert witnesses where necessary. On a typical day last week, we dissected the decision not to site a \u00a3500m science project in the north-west of England - and also the Foreign Office efforts to persuade Premier Oil to pull out of Burma. In both cases, the minister responsible was then subjected to forensic questioning on the basis of the evidence, very much in the Robin Day tradition. This sequential approach is highly satisfying. The Today Programme - needing to serve an audience which changes frequently over three hours - is bound to be far more episodic. It also has to look ahead to the coming day, which sometimes allows ministers to discuss the principles behind a policy initiative before the details have been released. They can then fall back on that stock defensive phrase: \"You wouldn't expect me to answer that until parliament has been informed...\" By lunchtime, it has become much clearer which of the diary stories deserve further investigation, but our approach does not endear us to political planners and strategists. They have their own agendas which do not invariably coincide with ours. The man we now know to be Alastair Campbell - PMOS to his friends (Prime Minister's official spokesman) - regards any approach by the World at One as inherently malign. Lobby correspondents who raise questions in Downing Street on our behalf are likely to be greeted with laughter: \"That sounds like another piece of Wato nonsense,\" would be an unusually polite response. (Wato is our everyday acronym: it rhymes, more or less, with Bertie Wooster's \"What Ho!\" It was Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's erstwhile sidekick, who once amended the acronym to read \"Wankers at One\", and I still have the T-shirt to prove it.) Needless to say, Campbell has not rushed to proffer the Prime Minister for interview on our programme. Although I spoke to Tony Blair frequently before the election, I have been vouchsafed just one interview since May 1997. And therein lies a tale. Adopting our normal approach, we thought we should decide our own news priorities each day of the 1997 campaign, and matters came to a head over the issue of air traffic. At the first hint that Labour in government might decide to carry out a Tory plan to privatise Britain's air traffic control system, we despatched a reporter in pursuit of Andrew Smith, the shadow minister who had so forcefully - and so recently - declared that Labour would never do any such thing. The subsequent broadcast outraged Campbell and helped to define what has remained, ever since, a highly charged relationship with Downing Street. Hostilities break out sporadically. In July 1998, for example, the PMOS was writing to the Times, explaining why some ministers were opting for \"Sofa TV\" such as Richard and Judy in preference to programmes like Today, Newsnight and the World at One. \"Very few people take the World at One seriously,\" he said, \"so regular appearances by ministers are unlikely.\" In the event, hardly a day goes by without the appearance of one - or more - ministers on World at One. Daily newspapers monitor our output assiduously, and we have even inspired cartoonists such as Matt and Steve Bell. So we continue to worry away at the stories we think are important, whatever efforts are made to deflect us, because that's what listeners say they want. The award from the Voice of the Listener and Viewer suggests we're on the right track, even if Alastair Campbell is never likely to vote for me.",

This might have been put beyond question in 1992, when many on all sides wanted him as speaker, but the Tory cabinet insisted on backing his senior, Peter Brooke. Consequently, 74 Tory MPs, led by John Biffen, voted for Betty Boothroyd as the first woman speaker.</p> <p>Sir Giles's popularity derived both from his warm, witty, affable personality and his role as a consensus-seeker, in the best tradition of one-nation Toryism. It was certainly his lack of right- wing zealotry and europhobia that led to his otherwise inexplicable sacking by Mrs Thatcher in 1987, with the consolation of a knighthood. He had played the game as a loyal Tory, restricting his deviations to backing joining the ERM, and opposing capital punishment and curbs on abortion.</p> <p>Because everyone agreed he had proved himself a shrewd and highly skilled minister in five departments, it was thought remarkable that he did not seem to bear a grudge for his unfair dismissal, when he should have been promoted to the cabinet. Fellow Tory MPs showed their admiration by electing him treasurer of the 1922 Committee the following year.</p> <p>Born in York, Shaw was the son of a qualified motor engineer in fiercely partisan Yorkshire. It was probably education which broadened Giles's viewpoint beyond that of his party and Commons colleague, the Yorkshire Thatcherite Marcus Fox. He went to Sedbergh school and St John's College, Cambridge, joining its Conservative association and becoming president of the Cambridge union. On returning to York, he became an executive of the confectionery firm Rowntee Mackintosh, rising to advertising manager, then marketing director. After fighting hopeless Hull West in 1966, he defeated Keith Hampson for selection for safe Pudsey, in the Leeds suburbs, after Joe Hiley retired.</p> <p>Arriving in parliament in March 1974, when Labour under Harold Wilson unexpectedly returned to power, Shaw did not have a chance to show his abilities until Mrs Thatcher made him parliamentary under-secretary for industry in Northern Ireland in 1979. He helped slim down Harland and Wolff, but was over-optimistic about De Lorean's car scam.</p> <p>In 1981, he followed Marcus Fox as under-secretary for environment. He stuck to the Thatcherite line, abolishing the Noise Advisory Council, resisting better access for the disabled to public buildings and insisting that dumping sewage at sea was acceptable. He also disclosed that licensed brothels and sex shops were under consideration. But he did make chimes on ice cream vans a nuisance, and resisted the privatisation of the Ordnance Survey.</p> <p>His brief stint as energy under-secretary included the beginning of the miners' strike and his stunt of swimming off the coast at Sellafield to demonstrate the safety of nearby bathing waters. He was promoted to minister of state at the Home Office in 1984, taking over from Douglas Hurd the Police and Criminal Justice Bill, whose stop-and-search provision he defended. He refused to rule out advertising on the BBC, and reduced the levy on ITV companies. But he resisted pressure to birch football hooligans.</p> <p>After replacing Peter Morrison as minister for industry in 1986, Shaw showed an aversion to intervention. He was one of three ministers at the Departyment of Trade and Industry who opposed its secretary of state, Paul Channon, when he wanted to protect Pilkington from takeover. He also refused to guarantee a longterm steelmaking future for Ravenscraig, and relaxed the ban on alcoholic drink in directors' boxes.</p> <p>Sacked in the wake of Mrs Thatcher's third victory in 1987, he urged flexibility on the poll tax and opposed the freezing of child benefit. He was a member of the 1922 Committee delegation in 1989 that urged Mrs Thatcher to moderate her stance.</p> <p>In 1990, Shaw became a director of British Steel and Yorkshire Water - after strongly supporting privati sation as \"the natural way to improve the water supply\". The Friends of Water group that he led campaigned for immunity from prosecution for polluting water and freedom to meet the costs of new pollution standards from higher charges.</p> <p>The 1992 refusal of the cabinet to back him for speaker took the shine off parliament for him. He was appoined to the prestigious liaison committee in 1992, and the privileges and intelligence and security committees in 1994. But he announced he would not stand again and retired at the 1997 general election.</p> <p>Shaw leaves his wife of 38 years, Dione, and their son and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 John Giles Dunkerley Shaw, politician, born November 16 1931; died April 12 2000</p>",

After replacing Peter Morrison as minister for industry in 1986, Shaw showed an aversion to intervention. He was one of three ministers at the Departyment of Trade and Industry who opposed its secretary of state, Paul Channon, when he wanted to protect Pilkington from takeover. He also refused to guarantee a longterm steelmaking future for Ravenscraig, and relaxed the ban on alcoholic drink in directors' boxes. Sacked in the wake of Mrs Thatcher's third victory in 1987, he urged flexibility on the poll tax and opposed the freezing of child benefit. He was a member of the 1922 Committee delegation in 1989 that urged Mrs Thatcher to moderate her stance. In 1990, Shaw became a director of British Steel and Yorkshire Water - after strongly supporting privati sation as \"the natural way to improve the water supply\". The Friends of Water group that he led campaigned for immunity from prosecution for polluting water and freedom to meet the costs of new pollution standards from higher charges. The 1992 refusal of the cabinet to back him for speaker took the shine off parliament for him. He was appoined to the prestigious liaison committee in 1992, and the privileges and intelligence and security committees in 1994. But he announced he would not stand again and retired at the 1997 general election. Shaw leaves his wife of 38 years, Dione, and their son and two daughters. \u0095 John Giles Dunkerley Shaw, politician, born November 16 1931; died April 12 2000",

You can become Britain's next e-millionaire!\" From today, there will be trails all over Channel 4 for a national competition and gameshow, The E-Millionaire Show, which aims to bring the new economy to the masses, right there into your front room. </p> <p>The website <a href=\"http://www.emillionaireshow.com\">www.emillionaireshow.com</a> (it only went up this morning), spells it out in simple terms for those who are still bamboozled by the new-fangled economy. \"Have you got a fantastic idea for a website?\" says the blurb. \"Well, we've got \u00a32m to invest. We want you to tell us about it ... just click on the button below\". </p> <p>It's an e-dream alright. But don't bother if you've got a business plan, or if you've so much as crossed the threshold of a First Tuesday meeting - The E-Millionaire Show is not for the likes of you. It is for your granny, who has long harboured a scheme to launch an international family photo swap-shop over the internet, or your little brother, who has been beavering away on that interactive skateboard in his bedroom, or your postman, who dreams of digitally delivering parcels from the comfort of his armchair. </p> <p>The old joke about the digital revolution used to be that it never happened. Now you can't get in a lift without meeting a teenage paper millionaire, dot.com fever is plastered all over the walls of the tube and BBC2 has commissioned a drama about a group of yetties - young, entrepreneurial and net-based flatmates - from the team behind This Life. </p> <p>The E-Millionaire show will be Who Wants to be a Millionaire? with digital knobs on. \"We're basically conducting a massive talent scout - it's a star search of the internet world,\" says Henrietta Conrad, co-executive producer and co-director with Sebastian Scott of Princess Productions. Scott and Conrad are known for turning mass-market solutions out of fringe culture: first the Big Breakfast (Scott at Planet 24), then Light Lunch with Mel and Sue and most recently, dotcomedy, which has received indifferent reviews. </p> <p>\"There's a huge amount of creativity that we can tap into that will thrive in the new economy,\" says Conrad. \"We are trying to create the people's e-millionaire.\" Scott allegedly came up with the idea because everywhere he went he was regaled with people's ideas for dot.com start-ups. </p> <p>\"First Tuesday [the networking event on the first Tuesday of every month] is fantastic but we don't want white, middle-class, well-educated people. We want to find a granny in Huddersfield who's got an idea but not the first clue how to go about it,\" says Conrad. </p> <p>Princess are expecting tens of thousands of applications to be processed through the website next week. Only 15 of those will be chosen, and will end up having to pitch their brilliant ideas to the British public on a live gameshow hosted by \"the incomparable\" Jon Snow in May. </p> <p>As in a gladiatorial knock-out, only five will go through to the final. The winner will get \u00a31m and the runners-up will get to share the rest of the cash, which has been provided by a consor tium of venture capitalists. If the business is a success, neither Princess nor Channel 4 will profit. The entrepreneur keeps a shareholding of (33%), with one member of the audience to win a 1% stake. The rest of us can always buy shares. </p> <p>But then - and this is the hitch - a year down the line the entrepreneur has to face the wrath or approbation of the public, as the documentary is broadcast and voters and shareholders will get to see how their little ship has fared in the tempestuous seas of e-commerce. According to David Lloyd, Four's head of news, current affairs and business programmes, Channel 4 has been looking for a mass-market internet solution for months: \"We've lived in the new economy for a while and television hasn't yet delivered a programme that will engage a large audience - and yet out there it's all buzzing ... you can't overestimate the way in which the new economy will convert business, particularly business-to-business relationships,\" says Lloyd. \"I was looking around for a way of bringing a sense of event to the area. Princess came up with a way of detonating the subject. </p> <p>\"This is something I as a viewer can learn about, I can relate to the competitive ups and downs, think the thought processes of venture capitalists, and then there is a lot of interactivity in terms of electing the finalists,\" says Lloyd. The E-Millionaire Show is about as interactive as TV and commerce can get without fitting set-top boxes with smart credit cards in all homes across the UK. </p> <p>Conrad hopes the series of shows, strung out over a seven-day period and shown at peak time, will also be educational. \"We take people through the whole revolution, the risks and pitfalls involved. In the last few weeks we have seen that it's not that easy to be a success, you have to have a fundamentally sound idea and plan.\" </p> <p>If The E-Millionaire Show is a hit, Channel 4 will have done what no television programme has yet managed to do - make the internet revolution comprehensible, let alone tangible.

      "bodyText": "You can hear the jingle already: \"You too can join the internet revolution! You can become Britain's next e-millionaire!\" From today, there will be trails all over Channel 4 for a national competition and gameshow, The E-Millionaire Show, which aims to bring the new economy to the masses, right there into your front room. The website www.emillionaireshow.com (it only went up this morning), spells it out in simple terms for those who are still bamboozled by the new-fangled economy. \"Have you got a fantastic idea for a website?\" says the blurb. \"Well, we've got \u00a32m to invest. We want you to tell us about it ... just click on the button below\". It's an e-dream alright. But don't bother if you've got a business plan, or if you've so much as crossed the threshold of a First Tuesday meeting - The E-Millionaire Show is not for the likes of you. It is for your granny, who has long harboured a scheme to launch an international family photo swap-shop over the internet, or your little brother, who has been beavering away on that interactive skateboard in his bedroom, or your postman, who dreams of digitally delivering parcels from the comfort of his armchair. The old joke about the digital revolution used to be that it never happened. Now you can't get in a lift without meeting a teenage paper millionaire, dot.com fever is plastered all over the walls of the tube and BBC2 has commissioned a drama about a group of yetties - young, entrepreneurial and net-based flatmates - from the team behind This Life. The E-Millionaire show will be Who Wants to be a Millionaire? with digital knobs on. \"We're basically conducting a massive talent scout - it's a star search of the internet world,\" says Henrietta Conrad, co-executive producer and co-director with Sebastian Scott of Princess Productions. Scott and Conrad are known for turning mass-market solutions out of fringe culture: first the Big Breakfast (Scott at Planet 24), then Light Lunch with Mel and Sue and most recently, dotcomedy, which has received indifferent reviews. \"There's a huge amount of creativity that we can tap into that will thrive in the new economy,\" says Conrad. \"We are trying to create the people's e-millionaire.\" Scott allegedly came up with the idea because everywhere he went he was regaled with people's ideas for dot.com start-ups. \"First Tuesday [the networking event on the first Tuesday of every month] is fantastic but we don't want white, middle-class, well-educated people. We want to find a granny in Huddersfield who's got an idea but not the first clue how to go about it,\" says Conrad. Princess are expecting tens of thousands of applications to be processed through the website next week. Only 15 of those will be chosen, and will end up having to pitch their brilliant ideas to the British public on a live gameshow hosted by \"the incomparable\" Jon Snow in May. As in a gladiatorial knock-out, only five will go through to the final. The winner will get \u00a31m and the runners-up will get to share the rest of the cash, which has been provided by a consor tium of venture capitalists. If the business is a success, neither Princess nor Channel 4 will profit. The entrepreneur keeps a shareholding of (33%), with one member of the audience to win a 1% stake. The rest of us can always buy shares. But then - and this is the hitch - a year down the line the entrepreneur has to face the wrath or approbation of the public, as the documentary is broadcast and voters and shareholders will get to see how their little ship has fared in the tempestuous seas of e-commerce. According to David Lloyd, Four's head of news, current affairs and business programmes, Channel 4 has been looking for a mass-market internet solution for months: \"We've lived in the new economy for a while and television hasn't yet delivered a programme that will engage a large audience - and yet out there it's all buzzing ... you can't overestimate the way in which the new economy will convert business, particularly business-to-business relationships,\" says Lloyd. \"I was looking around for a way of bringing a sense of event to the area. Princess came up with a way of detonating the subject. \"This is something I as a viewer can learn about, I can relate to the competitive ups and downs, think the thought processes of venture capitalists, and then there is a lot of interactivity in terms of electing the finalists,\" says Lloyd. The E-Millionaire Show is about as interactive as TV and commerce can get without fitting set-top boxes with smart credit cards in all homes across the UK. Conrad hopes the series of shows, strung out over a seven-day period and shown at peak time, will also be educational. \"We take people through the whole revolution, the risks and pitfalls involved. In the last few weeks we have seen that it's not that easy to be a success, you have to have a fundamentally sound idea and plan.\" If The E-Millionaire Show is a hit, Channel 4 will have done what no television programme has yet managed to do - make the internet revolution comprehensible, let alone tangible. Panorama's recent attempt to 'go inside' the new economy was derided by anyone who was within it. It focused on the sensational cyber-crimes of \"ramping\" and \"bashing\" and gave a warped overall picture of the biggest economic change to hit Britain since the industrial revolution. So it is only fair that everyone in Britain gets a slice of the action. Revolutions are for everyone and they will be televised. Lloyd has great faith in the show's success. \"Make no mistake, this is a very bold move. If it works it will locate Channel 4 where it wants to be - right in the swing of the new economy. Others have yet to make a stir in this area and it's right that Channel 4 does - sometimes it takes one programme to change the landscape.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>Quarantine, Jim Crace's novel about Jesus in the desert, won the Whitbread Best Novel Prize. Ben Payne thinks he can turn it into a good play.  Chris Arnot talks to both of them</p>",
      "byline": "Chris Arnot",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The author Jim Crace is sitting with rock-like stillness on the edge of a grubby yellow sofa in the far corner of the rehearsal room. Perched on an adjacent chair, the literary manager of Birmingham Rep, Ben Payne, is almost motionless too. But the way he fiddles with his earring every now and then suggests he might not be quite as calm as he appears. </p> <p>A little apprehension would be understandable. It was Payne's idea to adapt for the stage Crace's novel Quarantine, about Jesus's 40 days in the Judean wilderness. What's more, he volunteered to take on the task himself - a heavy responsibility considering the critical praise heaped on the book, winner of the 1997 Whitbread Prize. </p> <p>Any worries that the novelist would heap criticism on his adaptation evaporate as Crace's face breaks into a grin. \"He's a great choice,\" he whispers to Payne, gesturing towards Terence Corrigan, the youthful actor who plays Christ. Corrigan is standing on a table talking to God with a discernible Northern Ireland accent. Crace likes the way he speaks and the way he looks: dark rather than blond. </p> <p>\"The western view of Christ is usually of a stainless being with fair hair who appears to have come from Oslo,\" he says after we have left the rehearsal room and settled in the cafe downstairs. \"This bloke looks and sounds like an over-zealous 19-year-old you might find in a church group or wandering down my street in Moseley.\" </p> <p>Crace has lived in the cosmopolitan Birmingham suburb for over 20 years. Like Payne, he moved to the Midlands from London. The two met when Payne rang Crace and suggested his widely acclaimed novel would make a great play. </p> <p>\"I hope I didn't sound churlish when I said I didn't want anything to do with it,\" Crace recalls. \"My craft is writing novels. I've done the odd play for Radio 4, but this is theatre. Writers who want to interfere with adaptations of their work are basically undemocratic. The book still stands as an entity on its own. And if the play's a total failure, then I want everyone to know that it's Ben's fault,\" he adds with another characteristic grin. </p> <p>Crace's mischievous sense of humour is never far from the surface, tempering the earnestness of his staunch socialist convictions. All the same, he gives the impression of being more serious about politics than about literature. \"There has been a film script of Quarantine,\" he reveals. \"It was reasonably well received, but the bottom line was that it would only be bankrolled if the story was relocated to a survivalists' camp in modern America. I was rather keen on the idea, but the bloody scriptwriters wouldn't go ahead with it. They were too respectful to me. A writer can't expect to keep control.\" </p> <p>Payne acknowledges Crace's generosity. \"If I'd had the sense of needing to have my homework marked all the time, I could never have got on with the script. But it was important to me for Jim to see what I'd done.\" </p> <p>Like the film scriptwriters, he had too much respect to take liberties with the novelist's work. His aim, he says, has not been to improve on the novel but to give live audiences a different yet equally rewarding experience of the story. </p> <p>Easier said than done. \"There is a clear dramatic shape to the book but not much dialogue,\" he says. \"And a lot of the action is internalised. In fiction, you can hide behind the narrative voice. I feared that wouldn't work for the stage.

      "bodyText": "The author Jim Crace is sitting with rock-like stillness on the edge of a grubby yellow sofa in the far corner of the rehearsal room. Perched on an adjacent chair, the literary manager of Birmingham Rep, Ben Payne, is almost motionless too. But the way he fiddles with his earring every now and then suggests he might not be quite as calm as he appears. A little apprehension would be understandable. It was Payne's idea to adapt for the stage Crace's novel Quarantine, about Jesus's 40 days in the Judean wilderness. What's more, he volunteered to take on the task himself - a heavy responsibility considering the critical praise heaped on the book, winner of the 1997 Whitbread Prize. Any worries that the novelist would heap criticism on his adaptation evaporate as Crace's face breaks into a grin. \"He's a great choice,\" he whispers to Payne, gesturing towards Terence Corrigan, the youthful actor who plays Christ. Corrigan is standing on a table talking to God with a discernible Northern Ireland accent. Crace likes the way he speaks and the way he looks: dark rather than blond. \"The western view of Christ is usually of a stainless being with fair hair who appears to have come from Oslo,\" he says after we have left the rehearsal room and settled in the cafe downstairs. \"This bloke looks and sounds like an over-zealous 19-year-old you might find in a church group or wandering down my street in Moseley.\" Crace has lived in the cosmopolitan Birmingham suburb for over 20 years. Like Payne, he moved to the Midlands from London. The two met when Payne rang Crace and suggested his widely acclaimed novel would make a great play. \"I hope I didn't sound churlish when I said I didn't want anything to do with it,\" Crace recalls. \"My craft is writing novels. I've done the odd play for Radio 4, but this is theatre. Writers who want to interfere with adaptations of their work are basically undemocratic. The book still stands as an entity on its own. And if the play's a total failure, then I want everyone to know that it's Ben's fault,\" he adds with another characteristic grin. Crace's mischievous sense of humour is never far from the surface, tempering the earnestness of his staunch socialist convictions. All the same, he gives the impression of being more serious about politics than about literature. \"There has been a film script of Quarantine,\" he reveals. \"It was reasonably well received, but the bottom line was that it would only be bankrolled if the story was relocated to a survivalists' camp in modern America. I was rather keen on the idea, but the bloody scriptwriters wouldn't go ahead with it. They were too respectful to me. A writer can't expect to keep control.\" Payne acknowledges Crace's generosity. \"If I'd had the sense of needing to have my homework marked all the time, I could never have got on with the script. But it was important to me for Jim to see what I'd done.\" Like the film scriptwriters, he had too much respect to take liberties with the novelist's work. His aim, he says, has not been to improve on the novel but to give live audiences a different yet equally rewarding experience of the story. Easier said than done. \"There is a clear dramatic shape to the book but not much dialogue,\" he says. \"And a lot of the action is internalised. In fiction, you can hide behind the narrative voice. I feared that wouldn't work for the stage. The challenge was to translate the language of the book into dialogue.\" Most stage and screen adaptations are of classics, which become costume dramas, he says. Quarantine \"offers the chance to create a very different and remote world on stage while bringing it into close proximity with contemporary audiences.\" As Crace points out, theatrical representations of biblical stories are hardly unfamiliar to us. \"This is the costume drama we've all been in,\" he says. \"Almost everyone who's been to primary school in Britain has had towels put on their heads to play the shepherds in the nativity play.\" He is pleased with the way Payne has approached the dialogue. \"When I listened to the read-through, I thought I could have written every word,\" he says. \"Ben has even taken a phrase from elsewhere in the book and put it at the end in a way that is packed with meaning and irony.

Abdi's parents have now lost four of their 10 children to starvation.</p> <p>Three years of drought have cost the nomadic peoples of Gode district everything - their livestock are dead, their crops withered.</p> <p>For the last six months thousands of these fiercely proud people have made the trek out of the barren dustbowl toward this town in Ogaden.</p> <p>The Ogaden Welfare Society, with help from the Save the Children Fund, has set up the feeding centre in Gode, but food and medicines are limited. Since it was established two months ago, 10% of the children admitted have died - most of them from hunger-related diseases like diarrhoea.</p> <p>\"We simply don't have any drugs,\" said Yibell Shibabaw, a nurse at Gode hospital.</p> <p>For months the OWS has been pleading for help from the Ethiopian government and the outside world, but until the harrowing pictures began appearing on television screens its SOS fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>Now the international community has responded with generous pledges of aid, which if delivered promptly should avert catastrophe.</p> <p>\"The promises they have made are adequate but the future for these people depends on when it gets here,\" said Mahmoud Ugas, the OWS area manager.</p> <p>In the village of Danan, 45 miles away, more than 3,000 people who have lost everything they own survive \"by the grace of God alone\", according to one community elder.</p> <p>There are no feeding centres here in Danan - just suffering. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res plans to open one soon, but for now there is little respite for the thousands sheltering here.</p> <p>They live in dome-shaped huts built from animal skins, cardboard, cloth - anything they can scavenge that will shelter them from the heat and the dust that blows incessantly across these desolate plains. The rotting carcasses of livestock emit a foul smell.</p> <p>Hani Abdi holds her one-year-old son. She does not know where her husband is and was driven here when the last of their livestock died. Her son's skin clings to his bones like an undersized shirt and his eyes are sunk inside a head that lolls from side to side.</p> <p>Half a mile from the camp Abdi Sheikh wanders away from one of hundreds of freshly dug graves, breaks a few branches from a nearby thorn brush and lays them on top of the mound of earth. \"I do this to stop the jackals and hyenas from eating my son's body,\" he said.</p> <p>Back at his hut, he pulls aside a stretch of cloth and points to the body of his wife. She has not eaten for more than a month and not spoken for four days. She is too weak to wave away the flies feeding at the corner of her eyes.</p> <p>The drought has already cost Abdi Sheikh 200 of his cows, sheep and goats and two of his children. \"Only God can save my wife,\" he said.</p> <p>But now as donations of aid pour in and aid agencies set up feeding centres, optimism is growing that the worst consequences of three years of drought may be averted.</p> <p>\"These people have lost everything they own and their coping mechanisms have been exhausted,\" Mr Ugas said. \"It will take years for them to recover but at least we should be able to keep them alive if the food comes in.\"</p> <p>OWS staff go on daily patrols through the bush looking for communities too weak or desperate to make the long walk to help. \"Because these people are nomads it's very difficult for us to know the true scale of this disaster,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Ugas, who has spent the day driving to watering holes, is trying to determine the health of the last livestock left alive in Ogaden - the camels. If they start dying, the long-term consequences of the drought could be catastrophic.</p> <p>\"These people are pastoralists and depend entirely on livestock. This drought has killed their livestock and pushed them into a cycle of aid dependency that will take years to change,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Abdi Farah's father sat in the back of the pick-up truck cradling his son's tiny body in his arms while his tears formed a dark circle on the purple shroud. Two-year-old Abdi spent the final two months of his life in a feeding centre in Gode, south-east Ethiopia, the victim of a drought which has already claimed hundreds of lives. He finally gave up the struggle early yesterday morning and later that day he was buried in a shallow grave next to his older sister, who died of hunger last month. Abdi's parents have now lost four of their 10 children to starvation. Three years of drought have cost the nomadic peoples of Gode district everything - their livestock are dead, their crops withered. For the last six months thousands of these fiercely proud people have made the trek out of the barren dustbowl toward this town in Ogaden. The Ogaden Welfare Society, with help from the Save the Children Fund, has set up the feeding centre in Gode, but food and medicines are limited. Since it was established two months ago, 10% of the children admitted have died - most of them from hunger-related diseases like diarrhoea. \"We simply don't have any drugs,\" said Yibell Shibabaw, a nurse at Gode hospital. For months the OWS has been pleading for help from the Ethiopian government and the outside world, but until the harrowing pictures began appearing on television screens its SOS fell on deaf ears. Now the international community has responded with generous pledges of aid, which if delivered promptly should avert catastrophe. \"The promises they have made are adequate but the future for these people depends on when it gets here,\" said Mahmoud Ugas, the OWS area manager. In the village of Danan, 45 miles away, more than 3,000 people who have lost everything they own survive \"by the grace of God alone\", according to one community elder. There are no feeding centres here in Danan - just suffering. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res plans to open one soon, but for now there is little respite for the thousands sheltering here. They live in dome-shaped huts built from animal skins, cardboard, cloth - anything they can scavenge that will shelter them from the heat and the dust that blows incessantly across these desolate plains. The rotting carcasses of livestock emit a foul smell. Hani Abdi holds her one-year-old son. She does not know where her husband is and was driven here when the last of their livestock died. Her son's skin clings to his bones like an undersized shirt and his eyes are sunk inside a head that lolls from side to side. Half a mile from the camp Abdi Sheikh wanders away from one of hundreds of freshly dug graves, breaks a few branches from a nearby thorn brush and lays them on top of the mound of earth. \"I do this to stop the jackals and hyenas from eating my son's body,\" he said. Back at his hut, he pulls aside a stretch of cloth and points to the body of his wife. She has not eaten for more than a month and not spoken for four days. She is too weak to wave away the flies feeding at the corner of her eyes. The drought has already cost Abdi Sheikh 200 of his cows, sheep and goats and two of his children. \"Only God can save my wife,\" he said. But now as donations of aid pour in and aid agencies set up feeding centres, optimism is growing that the worst consequences of three years of drought may be averted. \"These people have lost everything they own and their coping mechanisms have been exhausted,\" Mr Ugas said. \"It will take years for them to recover but at least we should be able to keep them alive if the food comes in.\" OWS staff go on daily patrols through the bush looking for communities too weak or desperate to make the long walk to help. \"Because these people are nomads it's very difficult for us to know the true scale of this disaster,\" he said. Mr Ugas, who has spent the day driving to watering holes, is trying to determine the health of the last livestock left alive in Ogaden - the camels. If they start dying, the long-term consequences of the drought could be catastrophic. \"These people are pastoralists and depend entirely on livestock. This drought has killed their livestock and pushed them into a cycle of aid dependency that will take years to change,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>The strains generated by international free trade in global markets surfaced on the streets of Seattle and are resurfacing again in Washington. </p> <p>Globalisation has spread fear throughout the world. Economic power is being concentrated through massive mergers. It is easy to understand why the World Trade Organisation, perceived as an instrument of wealthy corporations, incurs opposition. </p> <p>As rapid economic change spreads insecurity, General Motors packs more punch than some European Union member states. In the United States, many fear that their jobs will be exported to the developing world. British workers share their concerns. At the end of 1999, the livelihoods of some 6,000 GMB union members employed in the clothing industry were jeopardised by Marks &amp; Spencer's decision to terminate long-standing contracts with British suppliers. The jobs were to move to the developing world where workers would be paid 4% of British labour rates. </p> <p>In more than 70 of the world's poorest nations, nearly 30m workers are employed in so-called free trade zones, making goods such as jeans for western markets. These employees, mainly women, work up to 16 hours a day in brutal conditions. Accidents are common. There are no trade unions and no labour regulations to offer basic protection. </p> <p>The multinationals' search for cheaper labour does not stop at replacing a protected, developed-world workforce with sweated adult labour. There are some 250m economically active children aged between five and 14. The WTO has said that its members will respect International Labour Organisation core standards against the worst forms of child labour. But there has been little progress. </p> <p>Labour standards are a fundamental human right. Yet, as demonstrated at Seattle, many developing countries oppose their introduction because they see them as disguised western self-interest. In their view, developed countries are attempting to narrow the labour cost gap to protect their jobs. </p> <p>But if this is the motive, the policy will surely fail. Good health and safety standards are cheap compared with wages. For example, the GMB has developed a needle guard for sewing machines that costs only a pound. </p> <p>No one is suggesting that factories in Sri Lanka should immediately pay the same wage rates as factories in the United States. The arguments about child labour and safety have to be based on principle. </p> <p>The trade union movement has argued for minimum employment protection standards by which nations and transnational corporations must abide. The positive outcome at Seattle was that many countries previously opposed to discussing the issue began to reconsider. The challenge is to ensure that developing countries gain from the introduction of safety standards and the right to join independent trade unions. </p> <p>A first step would be to set up a permanent ILO-WTO working group.

      "bodyText": "The strains generated by international free trade in global markets surfaced on the streets of Seattle and are resurfacing again in Washington. Globalisation has spread fear throughout the world. Economic power is being concentrated through massive mergers. It is easy to understand why the World Trade Organisation, perceived as an instrument of wealthy corporations, incurs opposition. As rapid economic change spreads insecurity, General Motors packs more punch than some European Union member states. In the United States, many fear that their jobs will be exported to the developing world. British workers share their concerns. At the end of 1999, the livelihoods of some 6,000 GMB union members employed in the clothing industry were jeopardised by Marks &amp; Spencer's decision to terminate long-standing contracts with British suppliers. The jobs were to move to the developing world where workers would be paid 4% of British labour rates. In more than 70 of the world's poorest nations, nearly 30m workers are employed in so-called free trade zones, making goods such as jeans for western markets. These employees, mainly women, work up to 16 hours a day in brutal conditions. Accidents are common. There are no trade unions and no labour regulations to offer basic protection. The multinationals' search for cheaper labour does not stop at replacing a protected, developed-world workforce with sweated adult labour. There are some 250m economically active children aged between five and 14. The WTO has said that its members will respect International Labour Organisation core standards against the worst forms of child labour. But there has been little progress. Labour standards are a fundamental human right. Yet, as demonstrated at Seattle, many developing countries oppose their introduction because they see them as disguised western self-interest. In their view, developed countries are attempting to narrow the labour cost gap to protect their jobs. But if this is the motive, the policy will surely fail. Good health and safety standards are cheap compared with wages. For example, the GMB has developed a needle guard for sewing machines that costs only a pound. No one is suggesting that factories in Sri Lanka should immediately pay the same wage rates as factories in the United States. The arguments about child labour and safety have to be based on principle. The trade union movement has argued for minimum employment protection standards by which nations and transnational corporations must abide. The positive outcome at Seattle was that many countries previously opposed to discussing the issue began to reconsider. The challenge is to ensure that developing countries gain from the introduction of safety standards and the right to join independent trade unions. A first step would be to set up a permanent ILO-WTO working group. This body should propose mechanisms to integrate labour rights into WTO rules and trade agreements. At the same time, industrialised countries should shun protectionist measures. The ILO should be given authority to monitor compliance with labour standards and to develop incentives for encouraging good practice. In a civilised society, we have to work together or each will suffer alone. The WTO rules must be reformed to enable governments and consumers to distinguish between products on ethical, environmental and health grounds. \u0095 John Edmonds is General Secretary of GMB.

      "bodyText": "The Russian president-elect, Vladimir Putin, flew into Britain last night ready to defy critics over his country's human rights record in Chechnya. On his first visit to the west since winning the election last month, Mr Putin faced condemnation from opposition politicians and human rights groups. Mr Putin has prepared his defence in readiness for the issue being raised by the prime minister, Tony Blair, when the two meet for lunch at Downing Street today. Mr Blair has been accused of being soft on Russian's actions in Chechnya compared with the reactions of countries such as France and Germany. But Downing Street said yesterday Mr Blair will be \"more pro-active than just dropping it into the conversation\". Mr Blair will press Mr Putin to allow access for UN human rights investigators trying to find out what has happened in Chechnya. Concern was raised recently that the UN high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, was denied access to villages. But Mr Putin will counter that some of the places she wanted to see either did not exist or were areas where her safety could not be guaranteed. A Russian source said Mr Putin will argue that there has been no systematic violation of human rights. \"There are unique cases by individual servicemen, but there are no war crimes,\" the source said. Mr Putin, the former KGB chief who is keen to use the British visit to help establish international credibility, is to meet British businessmen in the morning before going on to Downing Street. In the early evening he will be received by the Queen at Windsor castle. He will also lay a wreath at a memorial in south London for the 27m Soviet citizens who died in the second world war. He is to visit St Paul's cathedral but has dropped plans to go to Westminster abbey. A short walkabout in the centre of London is expected, depending on how long the Downing Street talks last. But, according to the Russians, it may have to be cancelled if they feel Mr Putin's safety cannot be guaranteed. The US-based group Human Rights Watch urged Mr Blair to do more than just express concern about Chechnya and warn Mr Putin that it would take Russia to the European court of human rights if it failed to properly investigate an alleged massacre in the Chechen town of Alkhan-Yurt in December. A Human Rights Watch spokeswoman said: \"There can be no question about what happened here. The only question is what Russia and its international partners are going to do about it.\" A London lawyer, Gareth Peirce, is taking Russia to the European court of human rights on behalf of a Chechen nurse, Sasita Khasuyeva, who alleges five of her patients were killed in front of her and 61 others vanished. The International Federation of Human Rights was unequivocal in its condemnation of the trip: \"This visit constitutes an encouragement for the Russian government to pursue, in complete impunity, its murderous politics towards Chechens.\" The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, described the visit as premature given that human rights violations continued in Chechnya.

Tony Blair's rush to embrace Vladimir Putin, first with his visit to St Petersburg during last month's election campaign and now by hosting the Russian president-elect in London, is shameful, unseemly and surprisingly old-fashioned. It has disturbing echoes of the Soviet period when western statesmen often competed with each other to see who could develop the best special relationship with the Kremlin. That was the Old Diplomacy and it ought to have been discarded in an era when state planners no longer decide on contracts and European governments profess their aspirations to a common foreign policy. Mr Blair's infatuation with Mr Putin also has echoes of the Yeltsin years, when western governments invested too much in personalities rather than process. Instead of trying to encourage the growth of democratic institutions, the values of the parliamentary way, public accountability, and a system of checks and balances, they made the mistake of endorsing almost everything the increasingly vain and ailing autocrat in the Kremlin did, as long as he called it \"reform\".</p> <p>With President Yeltsin's departure the west had a chance for a fresh start, yet Mr Blair did not even observe the niceties of meeting any other presidential candidates when he travelled to St Petersburg. What kind of message of respect for pluralism did that send? The precipitate invitation for Mr Putin to visit the United Kingdom is doubly misguided at a moment when international criticism from respected human rights organisations and independent observers over Russia's tactics in its war in Chechnya is mounting. The prime minister argues that he did raise his concerns over Chechnya during his visit and did ask Mr Putin to provide access to international monitors. His overtures failed. And when the Council of Europe debated Russia's suspension two weeks ago it was UK diplomats who sought the softest resolution.</p> <p>It would have been much better for the UK to hold back until after Mr Putin is inaugurated next month. We do not want a freeze with Moscow, but nor do we want unseemly friendliness. Instead, we should stick to a cool and united European line which makes it clear to Moscow that the kind of brutalities being perpetrated by Russian forces in Chechnya are unacceptable on this continent. On Kosovo Mr Blair saw more clearly than some other leaders that the Serbian security forces' tactics of overkill and their wanton failure to distinguish between combatants and civilians were outrageous. It is strange he does not understand that Russian forces are acting similarly in Chechnya.</p> <p>No one doubts that Chechens have also committed atrocities, but neither under international law nor under the values of the Council of Europe does that justify atrocities in return. The council has asked its members to take Russia to the European Court for Human Rights over Chechnya. Mr Blair can redeem his earlier mistakes by announcing during Mr Putin's current visit to London that Britain will join that endeavour unless Moscow changes its tactics, sets up a serious inquiry into the complaint and allows international investigators into Chechnya forthwith. This is not a call for economic sanctions since they rarely work. Nor is it an attempt to humiliate Russia. Russia deserves to be strong and will be, whatever the west does. It is simply a public message to all Russia's leaders, in the Kremlin, the Duma, and the armed forces' general staff, that in Chechnya they have to clean up their act.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The National Trust has been challenged to come clean about the passionate truth hidden beneath the smooth green curves of some of its most famous landscaped gardens.</p> <p>\"These gardens are all about sex, but their history is being covered up by National Trust prudery,\" said the architectural historian Dan Cruikshank. \"This makes it impossible to understand their true significance and historical importance.\"</p> <p>The sexual symbolism of the gardens - artificial hollows and mounds, temples and columns - would have been clear to an educated 18th-century audience steeped in classical culture, he said. The modern visitor needed a little extra help but none was offered by the guide books.</p> <p>The most notorious garden, laid out as a naked woman beside a swan shaped lake to recall the legend of Leda, is primly described in the National Trust visitors' handbook as \"a perfectly preserved rococo landscape garden\".</p> <p>Richard Wheeler, the trust's senior land agent for the region, said: \"Our guide book is being rewritten. I'm sure it will be possible to incorporate a little more on the history of the garden.\"</p> <p>Mr Cruikshank believes the censorship of the gardens reflects the blind eye turned to the sexual history of the 18th century. In a forthcoming programme in BBC2's One Foot in the Past series he stresses that tracts of Georgian London were built on the profits of the largest sex industry Britain has ever known. One in eight of adult females was a prostitute.</p> <p>He suggested that the erotic gardens came not just from a time of unparalleled sexual frankness, but also from the interest in the classical culture of Greece and Rome, seen as an idyll of sexual licence and freedom as well as of great art and architecture.</p> <p>The National Trust gardens at Stourhead in Wiltshire and Stowe in Buckinghamshire have temples to pagan gods, but the most blatant display was West Wycombe, laid out in the shape of a naked woman, centred on a Mound of Venus. It was created by Sir Francis Dashwood, politician, art lover, and founder of the Hell Fire Club and the Society of Dilettanti, devoted to pleasures of the flesh.</p> <p>A regular guest, John Wilkes, an MP and mayor of London, fell out with the Hell Fire Club when he smuggled a baboon dressed as the devil into what was supposed to be a harmless Satanic ritual. \"There is one remarkable temple in the gardens at West Wycombe, dedicated to the Egyptian hieroglyphic for **** [sic]. To this object his lordship's devotion is undoubtedly sincere, though I believe now not fervent,\" he wrote.</p> <p>The entrance to the grotto within the mound, known as Venus's parlour, was described as The Gate of Life. Many of the most explicit aspects of the garden were swept away by the next generation of Dashwoods, who called in Capability Brown to restore order.</p> <p>The temple with the statue of Venus, which tops the mound, was recently restored by the architect Quinlan Terry, commissioned by the latest Sir Francis Dashwood, who died three weeks ago and whose father gave the house and gardens to the National Trust.</p> <p>In an article to be published in the New Arcadian journal, Mr Wheeler suggests that West Wycombe was planned as a parody of the nearby and far more famous Stowe, which was laid out as gardens of virtuous and vicious love: virtue was a chaste maiden pointing to a steep, stony, straight path; vice, though more picturesque, was ultimately deeply depressing.</p> <p>Mr Wheeler said it would destroy the charm and mystery of the gardens to spell out their imagery in signs or guide books. \"We are hiding nothing. These pleasures are here for people to stumble upon for themselves.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The National Trust has been challenged to come clean about the passionate truth hidden beneath the smooth green curves of some of its most famous landscaped gardens. \"These gardens are all about sex, but their history is being covered up by National Trust prudery,\" said the architectural historian Dan Cruikshank. \"This makes it impossible to understand their true significance and historical importance.\" The sexual symbolism of the gardens - artificial hollows and mounds, temples and columns - would have been clear to an educated 18th-century audience steeped in classical culture, he said. The modern visitor needed a little extra help but none was offered by the guide books. The most notorious garden, laid out as a naked woman beside a swan shaped lake to recall the legend of Leda, is primly described in the National Trust visitors' handbook as \"a perfectly preserved rococo landscape garden\". Richard Wheeler, the trust's senior land agent for the region, said: \"Our guide book is being rewritten. I'm sure it will be possible to incorporate a little more on the history of the garden.\" Mr Cruikshank believes the censorship of the gardens reflects the blind eye turned to the sexual history of the 18th century. In a forthcoming programme in BBC2's One Foot in the Past series he stresses that tracts of Georgian London were built on the profits of the largest sex industry Britain has ever known. One in eight of adult females was a prostitute. He suggested that the erotic gardens came not just from a time of unparalleled sexual frankness, but also from the interest in the classical culture of Greece and Rome, seen as an idyll of sexual licence and freedom as well as of great art and architecture. The National Trust gardens at Stourhead in Wiltshire and Stowe in Buckinghamshire have temples to pagan gods, but the most blatant display was West Wycombe, laid out in the shape of a naked woman, centred on a Mound of Venus. It was created by Sir Francis Dashwood, politician, art lover, and founder of the Hell Fire Club and the Society of Dilettanti, devoted to pleasures of the flesh. A regular guest, John Wilkes, an MP and mayor of London, fell out with the Hell Fire Club when he smuggled a baboon dressed as the devil into what was supposed to be a harmless Satanic ritual. \"There is one remarkable temple in the gardens at West Wycombe, dedicated to the Egyptian hieroglyphic for **** [sic]. To this object his lordship's devotion is undoubtedly sincere, though I believe now not fervent,\" he wrote. The entrance to the grotto within the mound, known as Venus's parlour, was described as The Gate of Life. Many of the most explicit aspects of the garden were swept away by the next generation of Dashwoods, who called in Capability Brown to restore order. The temple with the statue of Venus, which tops the mound, was recently restored by the architect Quinlan Terry, commissioned by the latest Sir Francis Dashwood, who died three weeks ago and whose father gave the house and gardens to the National Trust. In an article to be published in the New Arcadian journal, Mr Wheeler suggests that West Wycombe was planned as a parody of the nearby and far more famous Stowe, which was laid out as gardens of virtuous and vicious love: virtue was a chaste maiden pointing to a steep, stony, straight path; vice, though more picturesque, was ultimately deeply depressing. Mr Wheeler said it would destroy the charm and mystery of the gardens to spell out their imagery in signs or guide books. \"We are hiding nothing. These pleasures are here for people to stumble upon for themselves.\"",

He also said that the world needs international institutions like the Fund and the Bank, and he's right about that too. Those who believe the Bretton Woods institutions are inherently corrupt are not only wrong, but are giving succour to extremists on the right who oppose all but minimalist government and despise internationalism. </p> <p>Now, the Fund and the Bank need to re-think how to manage the global economy. For years, they have operated rather like the mediaeval Vatican, insisting on the one true faith. It should come as no surprise to find that they are now faced with a group of unruly heretics who not only refuse to believe but are prepared to resist. </p> <p><strong> Wounding attack</strong></p> <p> The heretics are not all eco-warriors and anarchists. Perhaps the most wounding attack on the Fund last week came from Joseph Stiglitz, until recently the chief economist of the Bank. The main thrust of Stiglitz's article in the New Republic magazine was that the IMF had woefully mishandled the financial crises of 1997-98, but he widened his argument with an attack on the Fund for its secrecy, its arrogance and its wrong-headed policies, describing it as full of \"third-rank students from first rate universities\". Ouch. </p> <p>\"When the IMF decides to assist a country, it dispatches a 'mission' of economists,\" he said. \"These economists frequently lack experience in the country; they are more likely to have knowledge of its five-star hotels than the villages that dot its countryside.\" Ouch, ouch. </p> <p>The second most compelling read of the week came from the Fund itself. In an overview of the world economy's development in the 20th century, it said that the past 100 years had been seen a stupendous increase in economic output, with goods and services exceeding everything that had been churned out between the dawn of time and 1900. </p> <p>At the same time, however, inequality between the world's rich and poor regions, measured by output per capita, has also increased dramatically. GDP per capita in Africa is lower today than it was in the rich countries in 1900. </p> <p>The Fund then divides the 20th century into four distinct periods - the Gold Standard era, the two world wars and the great depression, the 1950-73 boom, and the period of globalisation. </p> <p>What the Fund believes is that \"modern financial markets promote the mutually beneficial exchange between net savers and users of capital for productive purposes over increasing numbers of economic agents and ever larger territories, thus contributing to the optimal use of capital and the maximisation of world output.\" </p> <p>Its figures, however, show that comfortably the most successful period of the past 100 years was 1950-73, \"characterised by exceptionally rapid output per capita growth (2.9% per year on average) and the recovery of world trade under the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates and widespread capital controls.\" The Fund says that pegged, but adjustable exchange rates and control of capital movements gave governments room to address domestic problems, while the IMF oversaw the international system, remarkably successfully too. </p> <p>\"During the Bretton Woods period, the stability of the real economy and of exchange rates reinforced each other. Wage pressures were moderate, reflecting the impact on labour markets of memories of high unemployment in the 1930s and rapid non-inflationary real wage growth, made possible by unexpectedly high productivity growth. Finally, capital controls remained in place, limiting the instability from disruptive international financial flows.\" </p> <p><strong> Golden Age a fluke</strong></p> <p> It may have been that the Golden Age was a fluke, a period of catch-up, with the world economy able to grow unusually rapidly due to the existence of a global output gap caused by the devastation of war. Some might say that growth would have been still faster, if trade and capital had been allowed to cross borders more easily. The alternative way of looking at things, however, is to say that the policies that worked so well once might work again. Indeed, the experience of Malaysia is that the sky does not fall in if countries re-impose capital controls. Malaysia's recovery has been as quick as any in south-east Asia. </p> <p>The Fund fully accepts that \"a pegged exchange rate, independent national monetary policy, and unrestricted international capital mobility cannot be achieved simultaneously.\" So, if one of the three has to be sacrificed, which? The argument in favour of liberalising capital flows is that more efficient markets enable money to flow where it is needed, and to countries without sufficient domestic savings to fund investment. </p> <p>However, the tendency has been for removal of controls to be followed by a surge of capital inflows, much of which has been for speculation rather than long-term investment. The counterpart to a surplus on the capital account has been a deficit on the current account, which has precipitated a crisis, leading to capital flight and austerity programmes under the aegis of the IMF. </p> <p>This is the way the Fund describes what has happened. \" Starting in the 80s, controls on international capital movements were dismantled in many countries in pursuit of efficiency gains from deregulation. The resulting large increase in internationally-mobile capital flows combined with domestic policy imbalances and volatile exchange rate expectations to generate repeated international financial crises.\" </p> <p>It seems a bit of a no-brainer. The Fund and the Bank agree that the priority is to tackle poverty and global inequality. But governments find it harder to pursue growth strategies and redistribution if they are in thrall to capricious global markets. So the solution should be to maximise domestic opportunity and provide the environment for countries to develop their own domestic financial institutions and create a flourishing market economy. </p> <p>One would have hoped some of the eggheads at the Fund would be proposing this. But maybe Stiglitz is right and they're not so clever after all.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The phenomenal rise of Vladimir Putin out of nowhere bore an eerie resemblance to the feat of political engineering that got Boris Yeltsin re-elected in 1996. From long experience with Boris Berezovsky, I saw his hand in both operations.</p> <p>I first met the Russian financier and industrialist at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 1996. The Communist candidate for the presidency of Russia, Gennadi Zyuganov, had been well received by the business community at Davos. I told Berezovsky that if Zyuganov was elected, he would not be safe in Russia.</p> <p>I wanted him to support Grigory Yavlinsky, whom I considered the only honest reformer among the candidates, but I was naive. I did not realise to what extent Berezovsky was involved in dealings with Yeltsin's family. According to his own public statements, my warning about his safety concentrated his mind. He got together with the other leading Russian businessmen who were attending the Davos conference and they formed a syndicate to work for Yeltsin's re-election. That is how they became the oligarchs.</p> <p>It was a remarkable piece of political engineering: Yeltsin started with an approval rating of lower than 10% and they succeeded in getting him re-elected. The campaign was managed by Anatoly Chubais. I do not know the details, but I can use my imagination. When one of Chubais's aides was caught leaving the Russian White House - the headquarters of the prime minister and his government - with some $200,000 (\u00a3125,000) in a suitcase, I am sure it was not play money.</p> <p>The oligarchs extorted a heavy price for their support of Yeltsin. They received shares in the most valuable state-owned companies as security against loans they made to the state budget in an infamous \"loans for shares\" scheme. After Yeltsin won the election, these companies were put up for auction and the oligarchs divided them among themselves.</p> <p>I know Chubais well. In my opinion he is a genuine reformer who sold his soul to the devil in order to fight what he called the red-brown menace - a combination of socialism and nationalism - which he believed would come to dominate Russia unless he did something to prevent it. After Yeltsin's re-election he again took charge of the economy, but he had difficulty controlling the oligarchs. I was greatly encouraged when Yeltsin brought Boris Nemtsov, the reformist governor of Nizhni-Novgorod, into the government and treated him as his adopted son. Chubais was tainted by the elections but Nemtsov was clean: he could stand firm where Chubais could not. I took this as a signal that the Yeltsin regime under the leadership of Chubais genuinely wanted to move away from robber capitalism toward legitimate capitalism.</p> <p>The budget deficit and money supply were kept within bounds and back taxes began to be collected. Inflation and interest rates declined. Shareholder rights were better respected and the stock market boomed. It was against this background that I decided in 1997 to participate in the auction of Svyazinvest, the state telephone holding company. I agonised over the decision. I was aware of the pervasive corruption in Russia. It would have been easier to keep my hands clean by sticking to philanthropy, but I felt that Russia needed foreign investment even more than philanthropy. If Russia could not make the transition from robber capitalism to legitimate capitalism, all my philanthropy was in vain. So I decided to participate in a competing bid for Svyazinvest; it turned out to be the winning one. This was the first genuine auction in which the state was not short-changed. Although we paid a fair price, just under $2bn (\u00a31.25bn), of which my funds put up nearly half, I calculated that it would prove to be a very rewarding investment if the transition to legitimate capitalism came to pass.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that is not what happened. The auction precipitated a knockdown, drag-out fight among the oligarchs, a falling-out among thieves. Some of the oligarchs were eager to make the transition to legitimacy, while others resisted it because they were incapable of working in a legitimate manner. The main opponent of the auction and its outcome was Berezovsky. After his allies lost the auction, he vowed to destroy Chubais.</p> <p>I had a number of heart-to-heart talks with him but I did not manage to dissuade him. I told him that he was a rich man, worth billions on paper. His major asset was Sibneft, one of the largest oil companies in the world. All he needed to do was to consolidate his position. If he could not do it himself, he could engage an investment banker. He told me I did not understand. It was not a question of how rich he was, but how he measured up against Chubais and the other oligarchs. They had made a deal, they must stick to it. He must destroy or be destroyed.</p> <p>I came to witness at close quarters an astonishing historical spectacle in which powerful men tried to reverse the results not only of the auction but of the entire effort of the government to control the oligarchs. I was watching people fighting in a boat while the boat itself was drifting toward a waterfall. As part of a campaign of charges and countercharges, Berezovsky revealed that Chubais had received $90,000 (\u00a360,000) from a book contract, which was in fact the other oligarchs' payment for his services as Yeltsin's campaign manager. Chubais was weakened and distracted by the constant need to defend himself. Tax collections required his personal intervention if they were to go forward, and tax revenues fell. There was a dangerous drift downward in the economy just as the Asian crisis of 1998 began to make its effects felt. It culminated in Russia defaulting on its internal debt in August 1998, which shook the international financial markets.</p> <p>Yeltsin's family, under the guidance of Berezovsky, were meanwhile looking for a successor to Yeltsin who would protect them against prosecution after the presidential election. They finally found one in the person of Vladimir Putin, the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB). In the summer of 1999 he was made prime minister and selected as Yeltsin's candidate for the presidency. There was a flare-up in Chechen terrorist activity. When Shamil Basayev, one of the Chechen terrorist commanders, invaded neighbouring Dagestan, Putin reacted vigorously. The security forces attacked the terrorists and Putin issued an ultimatum, announcing that Dagestan would be cleansed of terrorists by August 25. The target date was met. The Russian population responded to Putin's handling of the situation enthusiastically and his popularity skyrocketed.</p> <p>Then there was a series of mysterious explosions in Moscow in which entire apartments were blown up and some 300 people killed while they slept. In the panic that followed, fear and anger were directed against the Chechens, assisted by a carefully orchestrated campaign in the press and television. Putin invaded Chechnya and the Duma elections were held in an atmosphere of war hysteria. Very few candidates dared to oppose the invasion.</p> <p>The Union of Rightist Forces, led by Chubais, Sergei Kiriyenko and other reformers, embraced Putin and scored quite well with 8.6%. Yevgeny Primakov, who had been considered the favourite candidate for the presidency, was decisively defeated. Yeltsin announced his resignation on New Year's Eve, virtually assuring the election of Putin as his successor. Primakov withdrew from the contest.</p> <p>Back in 1996, Berezovsky and I had a number of very frank discussions about the election campaign. I got to know how he operates.</p> <p>Then we became adversaries in the Svyazinvest auction, but we continued to talk to each other. I tried to convert him from robber capitalist to legitimate capitalist. He tried to use me in his campaign for the chairmanship of Gazprom - by far the most powerful commercial entity in Russia. In June 1997 he invited me to Sochi, on the Black Sea, to visit Viktor Chernomyrdin, who had been chairman of Gazprom before he became prime minister, and subsequently flew me back to Moscow in his private plane. He told me that both Chubais and Nemtsov supported his candidacy. I did not believe him, so I asked Nemtsov. That was the first he had heard about it. \"Over my dead body,\" was his reaction.</p> <p>Afterwards, I had lunch with Berezovsky at his \"club\", which was decorated, deliberately or not, in the way Hollywood would represent a mafia hangout. I was the only guest. I did not tell him what Nemtsov had said, but I did tell him that I had asked Nemtsov and that he had claimed that he did not know about Berezovsky's quest for the chairmanship of Gazprom. This made Berezovsky very angry and his anger gave me the chills. He did not say so, but he made me feel that I had betrayed him. It was a turning point in our relationship.</p> <p>Berezovsky saw the world through the prism of his personal interests. He had no difficulty in subordinating the fate of Russia to his own. He genuinely believed that he and the oligarchs had bought the government by paying for Yeltsin's re-election and that the government had reneged on the bargain by allowing a genuine auction for Svyazinvest. He was determined to bring down Chubais for betraying him. When I warned him that he was pulling down the tent around him, he answered that he had no choice; if he showed any weakness he could not survive.</p> <p>I could not understand this at the time, but in retrospect it makes perfect sense. Berezovsky could not make the transition to legitimacy; his only chance of survival was to keep people entangled in the web of illegitimate relationships that he had established. He had a hold on Yeltsin because of the favours he had arranged for Yeltsin's family. For instance, he had made Yeltsin's son-in-law a manager of Aeroflot, whose hard-currency revenues were diverted to a Swiss company called Forus, which, it was explained to me, meant \"for us\". This gave him power over Yeltsin that none of the other oligarchs had. Berezovsky also had a hold on Chubais, and when the chips were down he did not hesitate to use it. The money Chubais received for the book contract caused his temporary downfall.</p> <p>Berezovsky and Yeltsin's family were looking for a way to perpetuate the immunity they enjoyed under Yeltsin's presidency. Berezovsky's situation became difficult when the scandal over the laundering of Russian illegal money in US banks broke in 1999. One way or another he had to find a successor to Yeltsin who would protect him. That is when the plan to promote Putin's candidacy was hatched.</p> <p>On the flight from Sochi to Moscow in 1997, Berezovsky had told me stories about how he had paid off the anti-Russian military commanders in Chechnya and Abkhazia. So when the Chechens invaded Dagestan, I smelled a rat. I set up a test: would Basayev withdraw by the deadline set by Putin? He did.</p> <p>There can be no doubt that it was the war in Chechnya that has propelled Putin to victory. Between 1994 and 1996, during the previous Chechen war, the Russian population was upset when it saw the devastation and suffering caused by the invasion of Chechnya. The protests by the mothers of enlisted soldiers and human rights activists helped to bring about a negotiated settlement. This time the reaction of the Russian population strongly contrasts with its earlier attitude. Admittedly, the Chechen terrorists must bear a large share of the blame. They captured aid workers and journalists, held them for ransom, and often killed them. There is hardly anybody left who dares to get involved with helping Chechens or with publicising the atrocities they have suffered. There has been a masterful manipulation of public sentiment against them.</p> <p>At the beginning of the post-Gorbachev years, Russians had a positive aversion to violence. In fact very little blood was spilled in the early days, and on the rare occasions when people were killed - in the Georgian capital Tblisi, in Lithuania, and later in the siege of the Duma in October 1993 - public opinion turned against those who used force. Not any more. By electing Putin president, the Russians become more implicated than ever in the bloodshed in Chechnya.</p> <p>There is a theory that a victim who has been sufficiently brutalised can become himself drawn to violence. The pattern seems to fit many violent criminals and it also seems to apply to ethnic violence. The Serbs have long considered themselves victims, and Milosevic could exploit this sentiment in pursuing a policy of ethnic cleansing. Something similar seems to have happened in Russia.</p> <p>Putin will try to re-establish a strong state and he may well succeed. By accomplishing the transition from robber capitalism to legitimate capitalism Putin may well preside over an economic recovery; my investments in Russia, including the one in Svyazinvest, may finally pay off. But Putin's state is unlikely to be built on the principles of an open society; it is more likely to be based on the demoralisation, humiliation and frustration of the Russian people. It is likely to continue to exploit the sense of terror that people felt when the apartment buildings blew up, and seek to establish the authority of the state at home and the glory of Russia in the world. We are facing a prospect that could have been avoided if the open societies of the west had been more firmly committed to the principles of open society themselves.</p> <p>In his farewell speech, Yeltsin asked for the forgiveness of the Russian people: for the fact that many of our hopes did not materialise; for things which to us seemed simple but turned out arduous.</p> <p>\"I want to ask forgiveness for the fact that I was not able to justify the hopes of some people who believed that we would be able to move forward in one swoop from a gray totalitarian and stagnant past to a bright, rich and civilised future.

      "bodyText": "The phenomenal rise of Vladimir Putin out of nowhere bore an eerie resemblance to the feat of political engineering that got Boris Yeltsin re-elected in 1996. From long experience with Boris Berezovsky, I saw his hand in both operations. I first met the Russian financier and industrialist at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 1996. The Communist candidate for the presidency of Russia, Gennadi Zyuganov, had been well received by the business community at Davos. I told Berezovsky that if Zyuganov was elected, he would not be safe in Russia. I wanted him to support Grigory Yavlinsky, whom I considered the only honest reformer among the candidates, but I was naive. I did not realise to what extent Berezovsky was involved in dealings with Yeltsin's family. According to his own public statements, my warning about his safety concentrated his mind. He got together with the other leading Russian businessmen who were attending the Davos conference and they formed a syndicate to work for Yeltsin's re-election. That is how they became the oligarchs. It was a remarkable piece of political engineering: Yeltsin started with an approval rating of lower than 10% and they succeeded in getting him re-elected. The campaign was managed by Anatoly Chubais. I do not know the details, but I can use my imagination. When one of Chubais's aides was caught leaving the Russian White House - the headquarters of the prime minister and his government - with some $200,000 (\u00a3125,000) in a suitcase, I am sure it was not play money. The oligarchs extorted a heavy price for their support of Yeltsin. They received shares in the most valuable state-owned companies as security against loans they made to the state budget in an infamous \"loans for shares\" scheme. After Yeltsin won the election, these companies were put up for auction and the oligarchs divided them among themselves. I know Chubais well. In my opinion he is a genuine reformer who sold his soul to the devil in order to fight what he called the red-brown menace - a combination of socialism and nationalism - which he believed would come to dominate Russia unless he did something to prevent it. After Yeltsin's re-election he again took charge of the economy, but he had difficulty controlling the oligarchs.

      "body": "<p>The name of Boris Berezovsky, Russia's most notorious oligarch, arouses, at best, profound suspicion in Russia. Many view the millionaire businessman - who became rich with the collapse of communism - with a loathing inspired by his influential backstage role in Russian politics.</p> <p>Although he lost a significant part of his empire last year when he was distanced from the state airline Aeroflot, Berezovsky currently holds crucial stakes in two of Russia's main television channels and in several of the leading daily newspapers, as well as powerful chunks in the country's car-trade, oil and aluminium industries.</p> <p>Since the mid-90s he has openly been using his business clout to exert influence over leaders in the Kremlin. Extremely charming and clever, he became a powerful figure in Boris Yeltsin's shadowy inner circle, \"the family\", a close associate of key presidential advisers and of Yeltsin's daughter and image maker, Tatyana Dyachenko.</p> <p>Berezovsky makes no attempt to hide the role he played in ensuring Yeltsin's re-election in the 1996 presidential vote, when he and a group of other influential businessmen used their powers to pull the president back from certain defeat in the polls.</p> <p>Russia's current president, Vladimir Putin, also owes a debt of gratitude to the tycoon. Putin's presidential victory was effectively secured during campaigning for last December's parliamentary elections, when a ferocious slur campaign run on Berezovsky's ORT TV channel eradicated his two main rivals. In a series of popular prime-time news shows, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov was portrayed as a murderous conman, while gory footage of a hip operation was broadcast to demonstrate that the former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov (who had recently undergone surgery) was too frail to run the country.</p> <p>Both men had been thought to be serious presidential contenders; both men later dropped out of the race. Berezovsky said that he was consulted by the show's producers and has freely admitted the role of his company in Putin's success. \"I was extremely pleased [with ORT's work],\" he said. \"I believe they helped Russia with a historic task.\"</p> <p>Berezovsky's involvement in the war in Chechnya is less clear. He was secretly recorded holding long negotiations with key warlords last year - although he claims he was trying to represent Russia's interests during the talks. Berezovsky's success at negotiating the release of hostages from Chechnya has also prompted suspicion about the closeness of his ties in the region. The Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov last week claimed that Berezovsky had helped finance warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab in their separatist campaign.</p> <p>Last December, the businessman was elected as the parliamentary representative for the nearby region of Karachevo-Cherkess - thereby securing himself immunity from prosecution. Swiss prosecutors continue to investigate the way two Berezovsky-owned companies in Switzerland handled revenues from Aeroflot's coffers.</p> <p>Berezovsky's future under Putin remains unclear. Some commentators expect the new president to prove his independence by making a great show of cutting ties with the powerful tycoons who wielded so much influence over Yeltsin. In his election campaigning, Putin won himself much popularity by promising to exterminate the oligarchs as a class, but Putin may not have enough power yet to distance himself from his backer.</p> <p>George Soros's feelings of hostility towards Berezovsky are reciprocated. The Russian responded with fury to Soros's description in this article of his club as a mafia hangout, pointing out the building had won a prize for the authenticity of its restoration. In a recent tirade he went on to describe Soros as a liar and a hypocrite who had blurred the line between business and philanthropy.</p>",

Many view the millionaire businessman - who became rich with the collapse of communism - with a loathing inspired by his influential backstage role in Russian politics. Although he lost a significant part of his empire last year when he was distanced from the state airline Aeroflot, Berezovsky currently holds crucial stakes in two of Russia's main television channels and in several of the leading daily newspapers, as well as powerful chunks in the country's car-trade, oil and aluminium industries. Since the mid-90s he has openly been using his business clout to exert influence over leaders in the Kremlin. Extremely charming and clever, he became a powerful figure in Boris Yeltsin's shadowy inner circle, \"the family\", a close associate of key presidential advisers and of Yeltsin's daughter and image maker, Tatyana Dyachenko. Berezovsky makes no attempt to hide the role he played in ensuring Yeltsin's re-election in the 1996 presidential vote, when he and a group of other influential businessmen used their powers to pull the president back from certain defeat in the polls. Russia's current president, Vladimir Putin, also owes a debt of gratitude to the tycoon. Putin's presidential victory was effectively secured during campaigning for last December's parliamentary elections, when a ferocious slur campaign run on Berezovsky's ORT TV channel eradicated his two main rivals. In a series of popular prime-time news shows, Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov was portrayed as a murderous conman, while gory footage of a hip operation was broadcast to demonstrate that the former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov (who had recently undergone surgery) was too frail to run the country. Both men had been thought to be serious presidential contenders; both men later dropped out of the race. Berezovsky said that he was consulted by the show's producers and has freely admitted the role of his company in Putin's success. \"I was extremely pleased [with ORT's work],\" he said. \"I believe they helped Russia with a historic task.\" Berezovsky's involvement in the war in Chechnya is less clear. He was secretly recorded holding long negotiations with key warlords last year - although he claims he was trying to represent Russia's interests during the talks. Berezovsky's success at negotiating the release of hostages from Chechnya has also prompted suspicion about the closeness of his ties in the region. The Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov last week claimed that Berezovsky had helped finance warlords Shamil Basayev and Khattab in their separatist campaign. Last December, the businessman was elected as the parliamentary representative for the nearby region of Karachevo-Cherkess - thereby securing himself immunity from prosecution. Swiss prosecutors continue to investigate the way two Berezovsky-owned companies in Switzerland handled revenues from Aeroflot's coffers. Berezovsky's future under Putin remains unclear. Some commentators expect the new president to prove his independence by making a great show of cutting ties with the powerful tycoons who wielded so much influence over Yeltsin. In his election campaigning, Putin won himself much popularity by promising to exterminate the oligarchs as a class, but Putin may not have enough power yet to distance himself from his backer. George Soros's feelings of hostility towards Berezovsky are reciprocated. The Russian responded with fury to Soros's description in this article of his club as a mafia hangout, pointing out the building had won a prize for the authenticity of its restoration. In a recent tirade he went on to describe Soros as a liar and a hypocrite who had blurred the line between business and philanthropy.",

They also plan jointly to assist councils which are struggling to succeed with adoption. One idea is to set up support teams to help them to learn from best practice elsewhere. There has been relentless criticism of councils' stewardship of adoption services and calls for the work to be handed over to a national agency. Directors of more than 150 English and Welsh social services authorities agreed on the plan at a private conference last week in Liverpool - as a group of MPs called on the Department of Health to send \"hit squads\" into councils performing poorly on adoption. Under the directors' plan, they will review their departments' adoption services and advise their councils to strengthen arrangements and increase investment in them. This will include providing extra resources for social workers once a child has been identified as ready for adoption; moving towards a targeted strategy for recruiting adoptive parents; improving support for new adoptive parents; and making adoption allowances more available. The plan also calls for sharing \"on a regional and national basis\" of details of children available for adoption, and of families ready to adopt, and for smaller authorities to join together in adoption partnerships. A report last week showed that about 2,400 children in England were awaiting adoption, while 1,300 families approved to adopt had not been matched with a child.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Lost souls shuffle in and out of the Neighbourhood Resource Centre. They come here to find out what jobs are going, to get help with housing problems, share a cuppa. It's Friday afternoon, and on the quiet side even for Cheltenham. The locals can be defensive about the town's sleepy image. Many didn't like it one bit when the newspapers reported that this was the last place you'd expect someone to go crazy with a 3ft-long samurai sword.</p> <p>On the wall are a series of mug shots under the heading Know Your Cheltenham Councillors. And on the bottom row is the smiling, kindly face of the Lib-Dem Andrew Pennington. Perhaps the shock is still so raw that no one has thought to replace it. Perhaps no one can bear to take his picture down.</p> <p>It was on January 28 that Robert Ashman went to see local MP Nigel Jones and his part-time assistant Pennington. Ashman was unemployed, had recently lost his home and was on a downward spiral. He believed he was the victim of a conspiracy between the borough council and Lloyds bank. Ashman had visited the surgery many times, but this time he took a sword from under his coat and lunged at Jones's stomach. Ashman pinned him to a sofa with the weight of his body. The MP protected himself with both hands, which were shredded and needed more than 50 stitches, before escaping to call for help. When the police arrived they found Pennington dead with 11 stab wounds.</p> <p>At the committal hearing, Jones said: \"Rob landed on top of me. I can recall him growling and saying, 'Yes, Yes,' in a loud and disturbing manner. His eyes were bulging. From the moment the sword was out, I did not see Andrew again. I believe I was the intended victim of the attack.\"</p> <p>Today, Ashman is due in court to make his plea. He is charged with the attempted murder of Nigel Jones and the murder of Andrew Pennington. At his committal a few weeks ago his lawyer argued there was insufficient evidence to sustain the charge of murder against Pennington - the implication being that Pennington had died after unfortunately getting in the way of Ashman's attempts to kill the MP.</p> <p>There are reminders of the tragedy everywhere. While waiting for Jones I pick up a spring edition of the council paper, the Clarion. \"A town in mourning,\" cries the sombre front-page headline. Jones arrives with two assistants. A big man with thick white hair and a hybrid beard, he looks rather jolly by nature. He holds out his hand to shake, and there is a neatly stitched crisscrossed patterning on his palm. Life lines. His little finger is somewhat littler than it used to be. It looks like a half-chewed saveloy. He says the police found his fingerprint on the floor of his office.</p> <p>Jones, 51, is not working full time yet, but he is back doing most of his constituency work, including today's surgery. \"I've been in parliament for a couple of days, but a couple of weeks back I had a very peculiar migraine and the doctor took a look at me and said I was doing too much... I haven't seen the loopy doctor yet.\" He smiles, tries to make a joke of it. I say it would be amazing if he didn't need psychiatric help. \"I don't know. I'm probably being naive, trying to be brave although you know I'm no hero. But I'm aiming to talk to somebody to see if there's any way... it's the thought processes I need to get out of my system. Somehow I need to stop thinking about what happened.\"</p> <p>Jones is a local lad. He speaks in a soft, comforting burr. You can sense those bewildered thought processes running ahead of the words, sometimes in opposition to them. \"I wake up in the middle of the night. I used to get a good night's sleep.\" He has nightmares.</p> <p>As well as learning to cope with the horror of the attack and the death of his close friend, Jones is currently living in a legalistic no-man's land. He repeatedly says that he can't talk about the incident or the alleged assailant in case it prejudices the trial. However frustrating, he can't yet answer the defence lawyer who asked why he \"fled from the scene like a robber\" - though the answer seems obvious enough to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Nigel Jones was not a celebrity MP. Until he was elected in 1992, he had spent 20 years working in computers for ICL. He is the type of old-fashioned liberal who worries about education and health and appears to be well to the left of New Labour.</p> <p>After the attack, he considered quitting politics, getting the hell out. \"You give up the day job, take the salary cut, give up the company car, you're on duty seven days a week, and this happens to you... You don't get this kind of thing in a normal job, and I don't think I've done anything to deserve it, frankly.\" Then the flowers and messages of support started coming, and he realised what had happened was a ghastly fluke rather than a reflection of the world he was now moving in. \"I think it was summed up by the lady who wrote: 'Don't let evil win.' That struck home with me.\"</p> <p>When did he find out that Pennington was dead? \"The doctor told me...\" He trails off.</p> <p>Jones had known Pennington for almost 20 years. He tells me how Andy fell in love with a woman who died from multiple sclerosis; how it was Andy who convinced him to stand for parliament when they were holidaying in Portugal with Jones's family; how Andy masterminded the victory in 1992 when he acted as agent; how despite representing the prosperous conservative town of Cheltenham Andy's commitment had always been to the disadavantaged.</p> <p>The day Pennington died, he had been to a meeting of a hospital trust to discuss the problem of how to maintain a secure environment for NHS workers dealing with the mentally ill. \"Ironic,\" says Jones glumly.</p> <p>The Neighbourhood Resource Centre is a makeshift while new offices are being prepared. Jones has not been back inside the old office. \"I went and saw the flowers that generous people had put outside to commemorate Andy, and I just thought I can't go back in there.\" A man walks in to complain about the lack of playing fields for the local kids. Jones spends half an hour with him, weighing up the options. It's tedious, important work.</p> <p>Since Pennington's death, his other assistant, David Fidgeon, has helped him with the surgeries. Has he noticed a change in his boss? \"Mostly, no. But occasionally there is a mental absence when you're being spoken to,\" he tells Jones. \"One of the jobs of an MP is to look interested when you're bored and I think you're less inclined to do that.\" Jones laughs long and hard: \"It's a second chance,\" he says, \"and I'm going to make the most of it.\"</p> <p>Another man walks in, more distressed than the previous constituent. Like the alleged assailant, this man has also lost his job, his partner, and he can't see a way forward. After discussing the ways in which they can get his former company to pay him the money he's still owed, the man leaves, grateful and slightly more hopeful.</p> <p>The surgery ends and we make our way towards the pub. Fidgeon points out the old office and says how shocked he was the first time he returned and found that the police hadn't cleared the place up. Jones turns away. Has he any sympathy for the assailant? \"At some stage I will have to forgive him... that's the only way to put it behind me and get on with my life. I'm a long way from that, though.\"</p> <p>Does he think Pennington saved his life? \"Yes. I know deep inside that little, brave man saved my life. I wouldn't be here now if he hadn't been there.\" I ask him whether he feels guilty that he survived. \"Not really. I've thought whether I could have done something else. But I don't think I could. My hands were ripped to pieces. There was no way I could have defended anybody. I knew I had to raise the alarm so that's what I did.\" We move away from the attack and Jones relaxes. He talks about football (his conflict of loyalties between Swindon Town and Cheltenham Town), beer (he is chair of the all-party parliamentary beer group but admits he's not much of a drinker), and eases into his favourite jokes.</p> <p>His wife Katy has joined us. She throws her eyes towards the ceiling. \"Oh, for God's sake! He does go on!\" They offer me a lift to the station, introduce me to their 14-year-old twin daughters who are stuffing themselves with Kentucky Fried Chicken in the back of the people carrier. Katy says the next train isn't for a couple of hours so why don't I come home for a bite to eat. We knock back reheated KFC, talk politics and laugh about some of the presents Jones has been sent - a huge bouquet from the Daily Mail who were desperate for an interview, a crate of beer, frozen peas, a box of chocolates from that \"nice\" Tory Angela Browning, and a squidgy airplane from Manchester airport to help him regain his finger movement.</p> <p>The two cats are resting on the window sill, the twins are checking their email, their oldest son Sam is out with his mates. Everything seems quietly contented. I ask Katy whether life has returned to normal. \"Well, I don't feel sick in the stomach now like I did. For a time all I could do when I saw people was hug them and cry.

      "bodyText": "Lost souls shuffle in and out of the Neighbourhood Resource Centre. They come here to find out what jobs are going, to get help with housing problems, share a cuppa. It's Friday afternoon, and on the quiet side even for Cheltenham. The locals can be defensive about the town's sleepy image. Many didn't like it one bit when the newspapers reported that this was the last place you'd expect someone to go crazy with a 3ft-long samurai sword. On the wall are a series of mug shots under the heading Know Your Cheltenham Councillors. And on the bottom row is the smiling, kindly face of the Lib-Dem Andrew Pennington. Perhaps the shock is still so raw that no one has thought to replace it. Perhaps no one can bear to take his picture down. It was on January 28 that Robert Ashman went to see local MP Nigel Jones and his part-time assistant Pennington. Ashman was unemployed, had recently lost his home and was on a downward spiral. He believed he was the victim of a conspiracy between the borough council and Lloyds bank. Ashman had visited the surgery many times, but this time he took a sword from under his coat and lunged at Jones's stomach. Ashman pinned him to a sofa with the weight of his body. The MP protected himself with both hands, which were shredded and needed more than 50 stitches, before escaping to call for help. When the police arrived they found Pennington dead with 11 stab wounds. At the committal hearing, Jones said: \"Rob landed on top of me. I can recall him growling and saying, 'Yes, Yes,' in a loud and disturbing manner. His eyes were bulging. From the moment the sword was out, I did not see Andrew again. I believe I was the intended victim of the attack.\" Today, Ashman is due in court to make his plea. He is charged with the attempted murder of Nigel Jones and the murder of Andrew Pennington. At his committal a few weeks ago his lawyer argued there was insufficient evidence to sustain the charge of murder against Pennington - the implication being that Pennington had died after unfortunately getting in the way of Ashman's attempts to kill the MP. There are reminders of the tragedy everywhere. While waiting for Jones I pick up a spring edition of the council paper, the Clarion. \"A town in mourning,\" cries the sombre front-page headline. Jones arrives with two assistants. A big man with thick white hair and a hybrid beard, he looks rather jolly by nature. He holds out his hand to shake, and there is a neatly stitched crisscrossed patterning on his palm. Life lines. His little finger is somewhat littler than it used to be. It looks like a half-chewed saveloy. He says the police found his fingerprint on the floor of his office. Jones, 51, is not working full time yet, but he is back doing most of his constituency work, including today's surgery. \"I've been in parliament for a couple of days, but a couple of weeks back I had a very peculiar migraine and the doctor took a look at me and said I was doing too much... I haven't seen the loopy doctor yet.\" He smiles, tries to make a joke of it. I say it would be amazing if he didn't need psychiatric help. \"I don't know. I'm probably being naive, trying to be brave although you know I'm no hero. But I'm aiming to talk to somebody to see if there's any way... it's the thought processes I need to get out of my system. Somehow I need to stop thinking about what happened.\" Jones is a local lad. He speaks in a soft, comforting burr. You can sense those bewildered thought processes running ahead of the words, sometimes in opposition to them. \"I wake up in the middle of the night. I used to get a good night's sleep.\" He has nightmares. As well as learning to cope with the horror of the attack and the death of his close friend, Jones is currently living in a legalistic no-man's land. He repeatedly says that he can't talk about the incident or the alleged assailant in case it prejudices the trial. However frustrating, he can't yet answer the defence lawyer who asked why he \"fled from the scene like a robber\" - though the answer seems obvious enough to the rest of the world. Nigel Jones was not a celebrity MP. Until he was elected in 1992, he had spent 20 years working in computers for ICL. He is the type of old-fashioned liberal who worries about education and health and appears to be well to the left of New Labour. After the attack, he considered quitting politics, getting the hell out. \"You give up the day job, take the salary cut, give up the company car, you're on duty seven days a week, and this happens to you... You don't get this kind of thing in a normal job, and I don't think I've done anything to deserve it, frankly.\" Then the flowers and messages of support started coming, and he realised what had happened was a ghastly fluke rather than a reflection of the world he was now moving in. \"I think it was summed up by the lady who wrote: 'Don't let evil win.' That struck home with me.\" When did he find out that Pennington was dead? \"The doctor told me...\" He trails off. Jones had known Pennington for almost 20 years. He tells me how Andy fell in love with a woman who died from multiple sclerosis; how it was Andy who convinced him to stand for parliament when they were holidaying in Portugal with Jones's family; how Andy masterminded the victory in 1992 when he acted as agent; how despite representing the prosperous conservative town of Cheltenham Andy's commitment had always been to the disadavantaged. The day Pennington died, he had been to a meeting of a hospital trust to discuss the problem of how to maintain a secure environment for NHS workers dealing with the mentally ill. \"Ironic,\" says Jones glumly. The Neighbourhood Resource Centre is a makeshift while new offices are being prepared. Jones has not been back inside the old office. \"I went and saw the flowers that generous people had put outside to commemorate Andy, and I just thought I can't go back in there.\" A man walks in to complain about the lack of playing fields for the local kids. Jones spends half an hour with him, weighing up the options. It's tedious, important work. Since Pennington's death, his other assistant, David Fidgeon, has helped him with the surgeries. Has he noticed a change in his boss? \"Mostly, no. But occasionally there is a mental absence when you're being spoken to,\" he tells Jones. \"One of the jobs of an MP is to look interested when you're bored and I think you're less inclined to do that.\" Jones laughs long and hard: \"It's a second chance,\" he says, \"and I'm going to make the most of it.\" Another man walks in, more distressed than the previous constituent. Like the alleged assailant, this man has also lost his job, his partner, and he can't see a way forward. After discussing the ways in which they can get his former company to pay him the money he's still owed, the man leaves, grateful and slightly more hopeful. The surgery ends and we make our way towards the pub. Fidgeon points out the old office and says how shocked he was the first time he returned and found that the police hadn't cleared the place up. Jones turns away. Has he any sympathy for the assailant? \"At some stage I will have to forgive him... that's the only way to put it behind me and get on with my life. I'm a long way from that, though.\" Does he think Pennington saved his life? \"Yes. I know deep inside that little, brave man saved my life. I wouldn't be here now if he hadn't been there.\" I ask him whether he feels guilty that he survived. \"Not really. I've thought whether I could have done something else. But I don't think I could. My hands were ripped to pieces. There was no way I could have defended anybody. I knew I had to raise the alarm so that's what I did.\" We move away from the attack and Jones relaxes. He talks about football (his conflict of loyalties between Swindon Town and Cheltenham Town), beer (he is chair of the all-party parliamentary beer group but admits he's not much of a drinker), and eases into his favourite jokes. His wife Katy has joined us. She throws her eyes towards the ceiling. \"Oh, for God's sake! He does go on!\" They offer me a lift to the station, introduce me to their 14-year-old twin daughters who are stuffing themselves with Kentucky Fried Chicken in the back of the people carrier. Katy says the next train isn't for a couple of hours so why don't I come home for a bite to eat. We knock back reheated KFC, talk politics and laugh about some of the presents Jones has been sent - a huge bouquet from the Daily Mail who were desperate for an interview, a crate of beer, frozen peas, a box of chocolates from that \"nice\" Tory Angela Browning, and a squidgy airplane from Manchester airport to help him regain his finger movement. The two cats are resting on the window sill, the twins are checking their email, their oldest son Sam is out with his mates. Everything seems quietly contented. I ask Katy whether life has returned to normal. \"Well, I don't feel sick in the stomach now like I did. For a time all I could do when I saw people was hug them and cry. I suppose I don't have much time to do my own thing at the moment - Nigel's frightened of going places by himself now.\" He's doing pretty well, I suggest. It's not yet three months. Jones looks at his watch. \"Eleven weeks and three hours,\" he says quietly.",

Contents (unofficial): \"Diligent scraping of other people's wastepaper baskets and even more obscene receptacles\" (historian David Starkey). So which one's the truth? Well, there are those who say that Lord Gnome, EJ Thribb, Lunchtime O'Booze, Mr Justice Cocklecarrot, Sylvie Krin and friends just aren't as funny as they once were. And who are these naysayers? Why, the handful of pathologically bitter former employees who've made second careers out of slagging the magazine off in print. But the golden age is past? Inevitably. The Eye was launched in the satire-hungry time of the Profumo affair and Beyond the Fringe. Whereas, clearly, there are no manifestly preposterous charlatans in government today. So what are we celebrating? Next week the magazine produces its 1,000th issue, something even its libidinous libel-trial foe Sir James Goldsmith couldn't manage. Despite sniping surrounding his appointment, crippling libel trials (Sonia Sutcliffe, Goldsmith, Maxwell) and acrimonious relations with the widow of ex-owner Peter Cook, editor Ian Hislop has ploughed on. Hislop? He's that bloke off the telly, isn't he? Indeed. Private Eye's fortnightly production schedule means the diminutive quipster has plenty of spare time to appear on Have I Got News for You, screwing up his face and being ungentlemanly to Paula Yates. Do say: \"Renew my subscription.\" Don't say: \"Have you noticed how Pass Notes isn't as funny as it...\" (continued on page 94). Not to be confused with: Its chronically beleaguered ex-rival Punch, which really isn't as funny as it used to be. [That's enough - Ed.]",

But there was a time when he seemed a different kind of leader from the despots who held Africa in their grip as Zimbabwe won independence 20 years ago.</p> <p>In a region afflicted by foreign-sponsored wars, growing unrest against apartheid and near economic collapse, Zimbabwe came to be viewed as an island of relative stability and order despite sporadic repression, most notably the army's murderous activities in Matabeleland. What generally distinguished Zimbabwe was the government's broad adherence to the rule of law.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's prime minister turned president may have been an old-fashioned Marxist, but he abided by the constitutional settlement which allowed his former enemies - the white racists who once ran Rhodesia - to sit in parliament. The same constitution guaranteed multiparty politics for a time, and ensured much of the farmland remained in white hands.</p> <p>The rulings of Zimbabwe's highest court were respected when they went against the government. Mr Mugabe wasn't happy about it, any more than he liked not being able to impose a one-party state or socialist economics.

      "bodyText": "Robert Mugabe may not be remembered as a beacon of hope after his crude defiance of the Harare high court's attempts to uphold the rule of law, and his sad failure to condemn the politically charged murder of a white farmer and two black opposition activists at the weekend. But there was a time when he seemed a different kind of leader from the despots who held Africa in their grip as Zimbabwe won independence 20 years ago. In a region afflicted by foreign-sponsored wars, growing unrest against apartheid and near economic collapse, Zimbabwe came to be viewed as an island of relative stability and order despite sporadic repression, most notably the army's murderous activities in Matabeleland. What generally distinguished Zimbabwe was the government's broad adherence to the rule of law. Zimbabwe's prime minister turned president may have been an old-fashioned Marxist, but he abided by the constitutional settlement which allowed his former enemies - the white racists who once ran Rhodesia - to sit in parliament. The same constitution guaranteed multiparty politics for a time, and ensured much of the farmland remained in white hands. The rulings of Zimbabwe's highest court were respected when they went against the government. Mr Mugabe wasn't happy about it, any more than he liked not being able to impose a one-party state or socialist economics. But, on the whole, there was something resembling the rule of law, for all the financial and political corruption. Those days are past. Zimbabwe's president now freely threatens that \"death will befall\" his opponents. The police ignore court orders permitting anti-government marches, and arrest protesters while the ruling party's club-wielding private army bludgeon peaceful demonstrators. The government has brushed aside a judge's writ requiring the public release of an official inquiry into the atrocities in Matabeleland. And now comes Mr Mugabe's open defiance of the high court's order to the police to remove thousands of poor blacks who have seized white-owned farm land. With the president's contempt for the courts came an implicit endorsement of political violence. It sets Zimbabwe on a dangerous if well-trodden path in Africa. Mobutu Sese Seko dragged Zaire down the road to lawlessness three decades ago.

I am proud to say that she was a genuine \"economic migrant\", called in by the catering industry to contribute to the British economy. We now hold British passports.</p> <p>Racists do not discriminate between asylum seekers and the rest of the ethnic minorities settled in the UK. And why should they? There is no doubt that the increase in racial attacks against ethnic minority groups is linked to the government's racist asylum and immigration policies. I am comforted that a high profile figure such as Bill Morris is articulating the fact that these policies are not only affecting vulnerable asylum seekers but also the ethnic community in general.</p> <p>Political parties are fully aware that asylum seekers do not have voting rights, but we should remind them that the great majority of ethnic minority members do. <br><b>Solange Valdez</b><br> London <br> Solvaldez@compuserve.com</p> <p>\u0095 Baroness Jay claims it \"beggars belief\" that truck drivers don't know they have stowaways on board (Jay attacks union chief in asylum row, April 15). As unions, employers and transport workers have vainly tried to explain to a wilfully deaf Home Office, the opposite is true.</p> <p>On articulated vehicles a trailer may be hauled by more than one truck during the course of a journey. Left unattended, while the driver has a meal, trailers are often entered, as French police turn a blind eye, via the roof. Drivers rarely load and never seal the trailers, which they are forbidden to open, on pain of breaking international customs laws, dismissal and invalidation of insurance. A classic double jeopardy. <br> <b> Dave Young</b><br> Editor <br> Truck &amp; Driver Magazine <br>mojotrux@ukonline.co.uk</p> <p>\u0095 The term bogus implies criticism of people who have come to the UK because of poverty, racism, lack of employment, or being in a war-zone - but are short of the life-endangerment that would give them asylum in this country. It does fuel racism, as bogus suggests lying or being a fake.</p> <p>What is needed is a neutral term for people who have left their countries for perfectly laudable reasons but don't fit \"our\" rules for asylum seekers. We suggest the term \"inadmissible asylum seekers\" for people who don't fit the current category. Do we have to insult them as well as exclude them? <br><b> Derek Smith, Becky Rees</b> <br> London</p> <p>\u0095 Jack Straw and Tony Blair have certainly not set out to encourage racism in this country, and they clearly just do not understand how Bill Morris could say their policies give support to racists. The Metropolitan police never, as a body, set out to be racist, but they succeeded in doing so without realising it. That is what the term \"institutional racism\" means.</p> <p>The consequence of what Bill Morris is saying is that that term could now be applied to the government, as well. Realising it is the first step towards doing something about it. Waving the Macpherson report in the air to establish their anti-racist credentials shows that they are still in denial. <br><b>Francis Sheehy Skeffington</b><br> Wakefield</p> <p>\u0095 The use by government of prejudicial and emotive language in relation to asylum seekers should have come as no surprise to Bill Morris. When facts get in the way of policy, this administration is as ready as the last to resort to emotion rather than argument. He need only think back to campaigns against single women, the unemployed, the disabled and benefit claimants. <br><b>T Todd </b><br> Abingdon, Oxon</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have lived in the UK from the age of 10; unlike today's asylum seekers, my mother arrived here in the 70s. I am proud to say that she was a genuine \"economic migrant\", called in by the catering industry to contribute to the British economy. We now hold British passports. Racists do not discriminate between asylum seekers and the rest of the ethnic minorities settled in the UK. And why should they? There is no doubt that the increase in racial attacks against ethnic minority groups is linked to the government's racist asylum and immigration policies. I am comforted that a high profile figure such as Bill Morris is articulating the fact that these policies are not only affecting vulnerable asylum seekers but also the ethnic community in general. Political parties are fully aware that asylum seekers do not have voting rights, but we should remind them that the great majority of ethnic minority members do. Solange Valdez London Solvaldez@compuserve.com \u0095 Baroness Jay claims it \"beggars belief\" that truck drivers don't know they have stowaways on board (Jay attacks union chief in asylum row, April 15). As unions, employers and transport workers have vainly tried to explain to a wilfully deaf Home Office, the opposite is true. On articulated vehicles a trailer may be hauled by more than one truck during the course of a journey. Left unattended, while the driver has a meal, trailers are often entered, as French police turn a blind eye, via the roof. Drivers rarely load and never seal the trailers, which they are forbidden to open, on pain of breaking international customs laws, dismissal and invalidation of insurance. A classic double jeopardy. Dave Young Editor Truck &amp; Driver Magazine mojotrux@ukonline.co.uk \u0095 The term bogus implies criticism of people who have come to the UK because of poverty, racism, lack of employment, or being in a war-zone - but are short of the life-endangerment that would give them asylum in this country. It does fuel racism, as bogus suggests lying or being a fake. What is needed is a neutral term for people who have left their countries for perfectly laudable reasons but don't fit \"our\" rules for asylum seekers. We suggest the term \"inadmissible asylum seekers\" for people who don't fit the current category. Do we have to insult them as well as exclude them? Derek Smith, Becky Rees London \u0095 Jack Straw and Tony Blair have certainly not set out to encourage racism in this country, and they clearly just do not understand how Bill Morris could say their policies give support to racists. The Metropolitan police never, as a body, set out to be racist, but they succeeded in doing so without realising it. That is what the term \"institutional racism\" means. The consequence of what Bill Morris is saying is that that term could now be applied to the government, as well. Realising it is the first step towards doing something about it. Waving the Macpherson report in the air to establish their anti-racist credentials shows that they are still in denial. Francis Sheehy Skeffington Wakefield \u0095 The use by government of prejudicial and emotive language in relation to asylum seekers should have come as no surprise to Bill Morris. When facts get in the way of policy, this administration is as ready as the last to resort to emotion rather than argument. He need only think back to campaigns against single women, the unemployed, the disabled and benefit claimants. T Todd Abingdon, Oxon",

The shipment was supported by export documents, including an end-user certificate signed by a senior officer in the Jordanian army, stating that the destination of the weapons was Jordan.</p> <p>But customs believed the true destination of the guns was Iraq, then covered by a government arms embargo because of the Iran-Iraq war. Dunk was marketing director of Atlantic Commercial, the arms dealing firm which had arranged the export, and seven customs officers quickly raided both his office and home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. They searched everywhere, even rummaging through a drawer containing his wife's underwear. Other officers raided his daughter's London home and his son's house in Guildford.</p> <p>Dunk explained that, although the guns had been ordered and paid for by the Iraqis, they were a gift to Jordan. He eventually pleaded guilty to exporting arms to Iraq and, in 1985, was fined \u00a320,000. His associate, Alexander Schlesinger, was fined \u00a33,000. But the two men only changed their plea to guilty after staff at the Jordanian and Iraqi embassies in London reneged on a promise to appear at the trial as defence witnesses.</p> <p>The crucial reason for this diplomatic change of heart only emerged seven years later, in 1992, in documents presented to Sir Richard Scott's arms-to-Iraq inquiry. These revealed that, at the behest of Customs and Excise, senior British diplomats had agreed to have \"friendly words\" with the Iraqi and Jordanian ambassadors. The Scott inquiry heard how Patrick Nixon, a senior Foreign Office official, told a colleague: \"I confess to innocent reluctance to connive at impeding the course of justice.\"</p> <p>Later, when Scott put it to Sir Stephen Egerton, former head of the Foreign Office Middle East department, that the interference had been \"disgraceful\", Egerton replied: \"I would say it was a bad show.\" Scott was not amused; in his report, he called the diplomats' action \"thoroughly reprehensible\", adding that the behaviour of customs officials deserved \"greater censure\".</p> <p>Armed with this new evidence, Dunk and Schlesinger returned to court. In 1994, Lord Taylor, then lord chief justice, quashed their convictions, saying that what he called the \"machinations\" in the case \"to prevent witnesses for the defence being available, coupled with the non-disclosure of what had been done, constituted such an interference with the justice process as to amount to an abuse of it\". He added that the probability that a jury would not have accepted the evidence of the embassy staff was not the point.

The sum, believed to be a record, was agreed by the home secre tary, Jack Straw, on the advice of an independent assessor, who said he had taken into account \"the seniority of the government officers who were involved in the wrongdoing\" and the irreparable damage which had been done to Dunk and his family.</p> <p>Finally, at the end of last year, the Foreign Office - in an unprecedented move - paid a total of \u00a3125,000 to Dunk and Schlesinger.

They said a psychologist had advised against it. In an interview with 60 Minutes yesterday, the boy's father denied claims that he had been abusive to his ex-wife and Elian.

She pouts into his lens, her taut, perfect breasts straining beneath a skimpy T-shirt slashed at the midriff. Only if you look very closely will you be able to make out the tiny letters on the shirt: Breakthrough - Fashion Targets Breast Cancer</p> <p>To date, the campaign, which has been endorsed by supermodels, fashion editors and top designers, has been a huge success, raising the \u00a315m target required for the launch of a centre for breast cancer research. With Prince Charles as its patron, and the likes of Kate Moss, Twiggy and Jerry Hall among its spokesmodels, Breakthrough has succeeded in putting the disease, which claims 1,000 women's lives a month, on the agenda in a direct and upbeat way.</p> <p>However, like any successful phenomenon, the backlash has already kicked in. Detractors are beginning to question the appropriateness of using pert-breasted nymphets to promote awareness of a disease which by its very nature ravages the female form. The argument clearly has some validity. If you have recently undergone invasive and painful reconstructive breast surgery, do you really want to be bombarded with images of smug supermodels wittering on about a disease which most of them have never had any direct experience of?</p> <p>That, says Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough, is missing the point. \"We get loads of feedback from our supporters. Ordinary women feel that it's great that models and celebs are putting breast cancer on the map, that they're prepared to put a T-shirt on. It gives encouragement and support.\" In America, radical breast cancer charities have run adverts depicting photos of women's breasts after radical surgery. Morgan disapproves of such tactics. \"That kind of approach frightens women, and might stop them from examining their breasts. Nine out of 10 lumps turn out to be non-cancerous and women should be aware of that.\"</p> <p>Morgan is conscious that a backlash against Breakthrough is in full force, but she refuses to be cowed by it. Last year, when women in Wonderbras ran the London Marathon to raise money for Breakthrough, she was hauled over the coals by Jenni Murray on Woman's Hour. \"The thing is, we're not a politically correct charity, and have never claimed to be. I felt like I'd been summoned to see the headmistress. The point about women wearing the Wonderbras was that they had all had mastectomies and they wanted to run in their bras. That's their choice and I don't think anyone can really say anything against that.\"</p> <p>Spend five minutes talking to Morgan and it becomes very clear that she views Breakthrough as a feminist issue. \"Six years ago when I joined the charity, people thought it was a lost cause. Breast cancer embraces two taboos, sex and death, and people didn't want to know. We tried to find ways of making the disease as upbeat and positive as possible.\" Certainly, as charity campaigns go, Breakthrough's has been defiantly girly. Apart from the supermodels, there is the pink ribbon month in October in tandem with Breast Cancer Care, the counselling charity, and there is also the Kiss Breast Cancer Goodbye initiative sponsored by Avon. This last campaign features free mini-lipsticks, with which supporters are invited to leave their lip print on a petition asking the government to match Breakthrough's fundraising pound for pound. It proved a great hit at last October's political party conferences, with Charles Kennedy, William Hague and Tony Blair all keen to try out Avon's autumn colours.</p> <p>Which is all well and good. But there's no getting away from the fact that campaigns such as Fashion Targets Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Awareness Month do tend to focus on celebrity breasts rather than the harsher realities of a disease for which there is as yet no certain cure. Marie-Claire magazine devoted its October issue to the disease and carried photos of topless celebrities waxing lyrical about their prized assets. To give the magazine its due, it did also carry an in-depth piece about how the disease had affected three generations of the same family, but it was the topless celebs that hit the headlines, not the disease. \"Did we do the wrong thing?\" ponders Liz Jones, the magazine's editor. \"I don't know. I don't think so, because we got sacks of mail from readers which was very positive. Also, I wanted to address the issue in a celebratory way, to take the fear out of the issue. We've been hit over the head with scaremongering articles about the disease for the last 20 years. Personally, I am now terrified of examining my breasts. I wanted to say to readers, please don't be frightened. In any case, what's wrong with using celebrities. The disease can attack anybody, even the rich and famous.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is that thrilled by the celebrity support, however. Miranda Vicente, 31, was diagnosed with the disease when she was just 23 and had both breasts removed. She subsequently made a documentary about having reconstructive surgery to help other women understand what the process was like. While she acknowledges that Breakthrough has increased awareness of the disease, she laments the lack of hard information that's getting through.</p> <p>\"Knowledge is power. I think that it should be talked about at school in connection with health education programmes. My daughter is nine and has lived through the disease with me. I want her to be fully aware of the risks. If only I had known what to look out for, I think that my situation would have been very different.\"</p> <p>Neither is she impressed with the use of pouty poster girls. \"Personally, I don't see the point of models looking gorgeous in the T-shirt; it's using sex and looking good to promote something that is the opposite of that. Breast cancer isn't about glossy images, and by associating the disease with that, it just distances it from normal people. It would be far better to use people in the ads who had direct contact with breast cancer. Then hopefully the public would be able to relate to it better. Awareness should be integrated into daily life, not put on a glamorous pedestal.\"</p> <p>There is another side to the argument, though: that there is no better way of reaching a young audience than by using pop stars and models. Christine Piper had a double lumpectomy in December 1998 and since then has raised \u00a318,000 for Breakthrough.</p> <p>\"Using Vogue models does not worry me. If they're willing to do it then it means that the message is getting across to young kids. Pop stars like the Spice Girls and Robbie Williams are particularly useful. My kids look at them and think, 'If it's OK for them to wear a T-shirt then it's OK for us too. And that all goes to spreading the message.

However, four finance ministers, including Laurent Fabius of France, failed to get into meetings.</p> <p>Sirens and helicopters were used by police in a massive show of force designed to prevent a repeat of the riots that paralysed Seattle during the meeting of the World Trade Organisation in December.</p> <p>Charles Ramsey, the Washington police chief, took to the front line as tension escalated between protesters and police officers from at least 15 law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service. He defused a potentially violent stand-off by ordering his men, in full riot gear, to remove their gas masks.</p> <p>Between 6,000 and 10,000 demonstrators squared up against police in streets cleared of traffic. Mobile phone-wielding organisers rallied their troops to close off streets in an area of about a square mile to the west of the White House.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of anti-globalisation protesters placed the World Bank and International Monetary Fund under siege yesterday as their demonstrations closed down the heart of the American capital. Finance ministers and central bankers were bussed in under armed guard soon after dawn to avoid the human chains which later formed around the IMF's 19th Street headquarters. However, four finance ministers, including Laurent Fabius of France, failed to get into meetings. Sirens and helicopters were used by police in a massive show of force designed to prevent a repeat of the riots that paralysed Seattle during the meeting of the World Trade Organisation in December. Charles Ramsey, the Washington police chief, took to the front line as tension escalated between protesters and police officers from at least 15 law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service. He defused a potentially violent stand-off by ordering his men, in full riot gear, to remove their gas masks. Between 6,000 and 10,000 demonstrators squared up against police in streets cleared of traffic. Mobile phone-wielding organisers rallied their troops to close off streets in an area of about a square mile to the west of the White House. They tied themselves together using lengths of pipe and chains. At times aggressive, they sought to bar access to the meetings to all delegates and observers. Although the protests were largely peaceful, there were several violent clashes as police officers used tear gas, pepper gas and batons and rode motorcycles at the crowds to disperse them. Laura Montgomery, one of the organisers of Mobilisation for Global Justice, said: \"There was some aggressive pushing and shoving and tear gassing.\" Tension had escalated after 600 people were arrested and the group's headquarters was closed on Saturday because of alleged fire regulation breaches. The IMF's international monetary and financial committee, chaired by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, went ahead as planned. However, many of Mr Brown's team were unable to break through the barricades. Inside the IMF building, politicians and bureaucrats said they understood the depth of feeling among the protesters, most of them students, but there was no turning back from globalisation. Patrick Reinsborough, a 27-year-old demonstrator from San Francisco, said: \"We are seeing a movement being formed in the US in connection with the global resistance to massive economic violence and ecological devastation around the world.\" Useful links World Bank/IMF 2000 spring meetings page Corporate Watch protest page Environment News Service Peacenet protest page Independent Media Center protest page",

That case, which took 62 days in court with exhibits running to more than 36,000 pages, also needed a mastery of complex evidence in an unfamiliar field.

George Carman, the Guardian's silk in the case, says: \"I'm sure he trusted his client. Who wouldn't, with a man of that background? I'm sure he was both surprised and shocked when he learned his client had committed perjury.\" At the bar, Carman crossed swords with him in around half a dozen cases, including the action against Channel 4 by journalist Jani Allan over allegations that she had an affair with Eugene Terre'Blanche, leader of the extreme right-wing South African AWB party. In his short time on the bench, say libel barristers, Gray has already shown his judicial qualities. Carman says: \"It's very difficult for a judge who hasn't been there all that long to settle down to a case with international implications and deliver himself of such a masterly judgment. It's rare that a libel case has social, political and cultural implications. It was a major challenge of detail and complexity.</p> <p>\"I think he has the makings of a very good judge indeed, and I think that's the view generally of the defamation bar.

In his short time on the bench, say libel barristers, Gray has already shown his judicial qualities. Carman says: \"It's very difficult for a judge who hasn't been there all that long to settle down to a case with international implications and deliver himself of such a masterly judgment. It's rare that a libel case has social, political and cultural implications. It was a major challenge of detail and complexity. \"I think he has the makings of a very good judge indeed, and I think that's the view generally of the defamation bar. He's not an over-zealous intervener. He listens very carefully and doesn't rush in where angels fear to tread.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is hard to put a face to the National Portrait Gallery. Often thought of as some sort of annexe to the much grander National Gallery next door in Trafalgar Square, the NPG is a separate institution, and a very distinctive one. It does one thing and does it well: collecting and displaying portraits of British people from, effectively, Tudor times to the present day. This is who we are, it says - or at least how we look. </p> <p>Now it has been extended and given new energy by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones, architects of the remodelled Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, a few minutes' walk from the NPG. But where the ROH is gracefully ostentatious, a diva of a building trying on frocks old and new, the NPG has retained its special, rather secret quality since being rebuilt. In fact, the new work can barely be seen from the street. The dramatic new three-storey wing fills much of the courtyard that separated the NPG from the National Gallery, but you would need a neck like a giraffe and a pair of opera glasses to spot it from the street. </p> <p>It is all but invisible until the visitor goes inside the original building, a curious, not quite neo-anything Victorian design by the obscure architect Ewan Christian. The old wooden revolving doors have gone, replaced by a sleek new airport-style number by Dixon Jones. The purpose of this, say the architects and the NPG's director Charles Saumarez Smith, is to make the entrance a much lighter, more engaging space. It was last renovated by Roderick Gradidge, whose mission some 20 years ago was to highlight the building's heavy-handed Victorian design rather than to nudge it into the late 20th century. </p> <p>Visitors who climb the stairs now are faced with a grand new pair of doors opening into the dramatic new extension. The sunlight that pours into the lofty atrium-like space is quite unexpected in a gallery that, for the most part, needs to keep light levels low. But it is this deliberate contrast between low-key galleries and highly animated new circulation space that makes the hidden extension both surprising and enjoyable. </p> <p>The idea was to give the gallery a new hub and create a new route up and through the galleries. A long escalator rises through the atrium, through slants and chutes of bright daylight to the atmospheric gloom of the new Tudor and Elizabethan gallery, the world of Holbein and Henry VIII. Here the walls are lined, by interior designer David Milnaric, in a grey military cloth, while the magnificent portraits are lit precisely by tiny spot lamps. Light is not allowed to spill beyond the frames. The result is delightful: the richly coloured portraits glow. </p> <p>One floor below is a balcony gallery hung from the floor above. It shows modern works in daylight, diffused by a set of angled white screens through which there are intriguing views of the atrium's rather complex geometry. What at first appears to be a tall rectangular box with an escalator climbing up it proves to be an irregular form of subtle, elongated angles. </p> <p>The balcony screens are a happy accident. The architects intended a completely open balcony gallery, but the lighting levels would have been too high for the comfort of curators. Down below, between the entrance to the new extension and the balcony gallery, is an information room. Visitors can access the NPG's collection through computer screens. </p> <p>And that's it? No. This furtive extension's two best secrets are its neat, wood-lined underground auditorium and its top-floor cafe, which offers a magnificent panorama of central London. There is no other view quite like it, and it is breathtaking. The main view is over the pepper-pot dome of the National Gallery, over Nelson's shoulder in Trafalgar Square and down to the Palace of Westminster. It is remarkable to see just how high above the river the National Gallery and NPG are. Such a view is priceless, and it is also an effective way of curing museum fatigue. After looking close-up at so many painted and photographed faces, the visitor's eyes and mind are given space to stretch and breathe. </p> <p>What the new extension does for the gallery as a whole is to act as a kind of junction box, and it should work well. The architecture is quietly dramatic and simple, which is appropriate given that the rest of the building is fussy, ornate and a little cramped. The building was always a bit potty. Originally, visitors had to climb up to the third floor picture gallery. Offices and studios were set below. Today these are housed in a separate building across Orange Street to make way for the galleries. These were added to, quietly and elegantly, by John and Su Miller in the 80s. It seems no one has ever wanted to make much fuss at the NPG. The portraits speak for themselves. This is a gallery that offers a singular experience - although the way visitors will use the building now will be quite different from how it was before. They will find new routes through the building, and are now more likely to linger in the gallery. Entry is still free, and it is a fine place in which to hide away on a rainy afternoon. </p> <p>The museum politics of the Dixon Jones extension are interesting too. In order to get the space Saumarez Smith wanted, his architects initiated a deal whereby part of the building would be given over to the National Gallery next door and vice versa. Museums and galleries guard their fiefdoms jealously, but a little to-ing and fro-ing between these neighbouring institutions has given both more of what they want and encouraged them to work more closely together. </p> <p>This facadeless, though not faceless, extension is in a way symbolic of millennial public architecture in Britain: shy, retiring and a conversion or adaptation of an existing building. God knows what Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth I and the rest would have made of such reticence. Even so, it is a fine foil to the opulent paintings it contains and, given the densely built-up location, which allows little or no room for forceful new architecture, this is reason enough to welcome its gentlemanly presence.</p>",

In 1989, Martin Amis published London Fields, set 10 years later.

Writing London Fields during the Cold War at a time when portable telephones were in-car models the size of sewing machines, Amis anticipated a nuclear stand-off and communication from call boxes.

The story, making a self-conscious nod to the milieu, is told through a simulated webcam set up in Caroline's fictional flat. </p> <p>Viewers are invited to give as much personal information as they like and become a passive character in the drama.

An interactive element allows viewers to colour the events by deciding what Caroline wears or makes for dinner, with the aim of establishing a virtual relationship with the character. </p> <p>Cassandras in the audience might find the idea of a cyber-friend confirms the more chilling view of the internet as a phenomenon which fuels a generation of socially inept people plugged into their PCs - a kind of adult Tamagochi which replaces real-life contact. For Freeserve it's a canny method of getting people back to its portal. </p> <p>Online programming is not entirely new. MSN ran an internet soap for six months called Melrose. But XPT, the fledgling production company behind Online Caroline, believes the advent of unmetered web access could reinvent the internet's role as an entertainment medium. </p> <p>\"People have been looking for a long time at making entertainment on the web work, but there is a sense that the audience is now really there,\" says Tim Wright, who wrote the script for the drama. \"Faster and cheaper internet access means there is a market for this kind of thing.\" </p> <p>The cast of five is led by unknown actress Mira Dovrini and the entire series was shot over five days in the Notting Hill flat of Wright's team-mate Rob Bevan. They claim the series has cost the same to make as a low-budget hour of TV drama - between \u00a360,000 and \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>By the end of the second episode a number of plot mechanisms are in place. Should Caroline go to a job in Paris with her boss who clearly has other things on his mind? Is her boyfriend having an affair with her best friend Sophie? As the story develops the plot becomes more darkly comic. </p> <p>Users can only see one sequence a day and are able to take a break. Smart technology means Caroline will automatically know which episode each of her friends has reached. The first episode aired this week but it's not too late to catch up. </p> <p>The story deliberately flirts with voyeurism and carries a \"live\" flash on screen as well as a real-time date and time. Caroline may wave at the camera or, in one sequence, a character lifts the flap of his jacket to reveal the legend \"you sad weirdo\" written on post-it notes and stuck to the seat of his trousers - an in-joke perhaps. </p> <p>\"Sadness is scalable,\" Wright says. \"Five minutes a day watching this is not too sad. If you explore every level and enter three different versions of your own character, then that might be pretty sad.\" </p> <p>To which Bevan quickly adds: \"It's no more sad than a lot of things people do on the net.\" </p> <p>The interactivity of the web means there will be a huge amount of experimentation to find what will work in online programming and what won't. There are unlikely parallels in Caroline with the epistolary novels of the eighteenth century, when writers still playing with ideas of narrative constructed books as a series of letters. When Caroline is under stress, her emails become disjointed and shorter - as any English graduate will tell you the same technique was used by Samuel Richardson to demonstrate his heroine's breakdown in Clarissa. </p> <p>XPT was set up a year ago and attracted investment from Freeserve which took a 19.5% stake in the company in February and has paid for the business to shift from bedrooms to a loft-style space in Bermondsey. </p> <p>None of three founders has experience in TV production. Bevan and Wright worked together at web agency Noho Digital, while fellow founder Tom Harvey held a number of positions at the BBC. </p> <p>They view their backgrounds in new media as an advantage instead of a hindrance because, they say, they are unencumbered by conventional views of storytelling. </p> <p>\"This is our medium,\" says Bevan. \"It's all we've done and we are not trying to impose thoughts from another medium onto it.\" </p> <p>Wright adds: \"There are some elements that are the same as TV production. You need character development, suspense, a beginning, middle and end. Much of this kind of thing online so far has been design-led and the basic elements of storytelling have been left out. </p> <p>\"A lot of television production companies are thinking about the internet as a bolt-on to a TV idea. We are trying to come at it from the other end.\" </p> <p>It was important, he says, not to allow the viewer to influence the final outcome of the story - which would not only make the characters passive but remove the reason for coming back to view the next episode. </p> <p>The interactive element can even break out of the PC. At one point Caroline hands out her phone num ber and viewers can call it to hear her answer machine and messages. </p> <p>The advent of internet-enabled phones could lead to SMS messages from the character or even phone calls. \"The story begins to bleed out into real life,\" says Bevan. </p> <p>Virtual gifts can already be sent to Caroline which then appear as props on screen and generate thanks in her next email. </p> <p>Harvey tells stories of people in pilots who have tried to call Caroline's number to warn her when, during one episode, her flat is being burgled - presumably the same people who tried to get a booking at the Crossroads Motel. He also refers to a man who got in trouble with his wife after she read the emails and refused to believe Caroline was a fictional character because she appeared to know so much about him. </p> <p>\"The interactivity really does suck you in,\" he says. \"You really do feel like she's a friend. It's like going to a cinema to watch a film, you suspend your disbelief and everything we are doing is about keeping the viewer in Caroline's world.\" </p> <p>XPT has only a vague notion of how it will build revenues - perhaps through merchandising, perhaps advertising. The ambition, though, is to build a portal with a whole series of interactive programming. EastEnders it's not, but endgame for the likes of XPT will surely be when internet access shifts to the television set and the lines between online drama and conventional broadcasting, and budgets, begin to blur.</p>",

The advent of internet-enabled phones could lead to SMS messages from the character or even phone calls. \"The story begins to bleed out into real life,\" says Bevan. Virtual gifts can already be sent to Caroline which then appear as props on screen and generate thanks in her next email. Harvey tells stories of people in pilots who have tried to call Caroline's number to warn her when, during one episode, her flat is being burgled - presumably the same people who tried to get a booking at the Crossroads Motel. He also refers to a man who got in trouble with his wife after she read the emails and refused to believe Caroline was a fictional character because she appeared to know so much about him. \"The interactivity really does suck you in,\" he says. \"You really do feel like she's a friend. It's like going to a cinema to watch a film, you suspend your disbelief and everything we are doing is about keeping the viewer in Caroline's world.\" XPT has only a vague notion of how it will build revenues - perhaps through merchandising, perhaps advertising. The ambition, though, is to build a portal with a whole series of interactive programming. EastEnders it's not, but endgame for the likes of XPT will surely be when internet access shifts to the television set and the lines between online drama and conventional broadcasting, and budgets, begin to blur.",

However, he allegedly told Sanjay Chawla, the bookmaker implicated in the scandal, that fixing the Tests would not be possible. He agreed to collaborate only on the one-day games, police sources allege. </p> <p>According to a statement by Rajesh Kalra, an associate of Chawla's who was arrested 10 days ago, the match-fixing conspiracy was hatched in December 1999 when Chawla flew to India from his home in London. The bookmaker told Kalra he had befriended Cronje and was planning to fix the matches scheduled to be held in March.
