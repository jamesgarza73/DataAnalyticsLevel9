They are likely to be paying at least \u00a3650 a week in hotel, transport and other costs on a UK assignment (\u00a31,650 if you are abroad), according to HCR Countrywide Mobility - so should therefore be ready to pay a bit more here and there to ensure you can work productively while you are away. Ask in advance if they would fly you back if you had an emergency at home. 'The more enlightened companies make provision,' says Andrew Finney of HCR. </p> <p> 3 Don't be fobbed off with being given a cheque and told to make your own accommodation arrangements. They should respond to the argument that you will be more effective in work if you do not have to view flats and negotiate with landladies. Most people can put up with hotel life for a few weeks - but after three months the lack of a kitchen and the need to pack up each weekend can become irksome. Having a flat gives you more space and the possibility of having friends and family to stay. </p> <p> 4 Negotiate about the number of trips home - especially if you are going abroad. 'There is an absolute minimum of once a month,' says Finney. 'But it depends on the seniority of the employee. At very senior levels, they get a trip back once a week. At more junior levels, it is once a month. It all comes down to cost benefit for the company.' </p> <p> 5 Expect some degree of flexible working. Some international weekly commuters do a Sunday to Friday morning week in order to avoid Monday morning and Friday evening rush hours - although this means that all of Friday can be one long rush hour. You will probably be heavily dependent on your laptop and mobile phone. </p> <p> 6 Recognise the cachet that a foreign assignment can add to your CV - but do not underestimate the strain it can put on relationships with a partner or children. More and more companies are now setting up short-term assignments - as they become international, perhaps, or set up new divisions around the UK.

Redundancies are on the increase and you could need cash to meet your mortgage payments and other necessities if the worst came to the worst. \u0095 Opt for a repayment rather than an interest-only mortgage, says Ray Bulger of adviser John Charcol. This way you are constantly chipping away at the capital rather than leaving it to the end of the term, a far riskier strategy. \u0095 Shop around for savings accounts. Although low inflation is pulling down savings rates, some institutions are offering better rates in order to build market share. See databank, page 12. \u0095 Be sceptical about products and schemes that seem to offer income markedly above the going rate. You can get better returns on risky investments but you can also lose all your money.

      "body": "<p>To say the little train meanders up the hill to Darjeeling is being rather optimistic. Stutters, more like, although that is too cruel. Poodles, perhaps, or its near relative, pootles. One should, after all, be kind to the train for it - or at least the steam engine - is unfathomably old. It is an ancient relic built in the late 19th century that has miraculously survived into the 21st thanks largely to the fact that until a few years ago no one ever thought of closing it. Now, recently blessed with Unesco World Heritage status, the line's future seems assured. </p> <p>One also has to be gentle on the train because it is ridiculously small. They call it the toy train and the description is accurate. For those who know anything about trains, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is a 2ft gauge, less than half the normal width between the rails, and consequently the carriages are small, a squeeze for any westerner with a broader than average beam. </p> <p>The locomotives are painted blue, just the same colour as Thomas the Tank Engine, and the resemblance does not end there: the engines teem with life, giving them a personality. Each one, as it chugs up the hill, has a team of half a dozen men perched on every protruding part - as well as the driver and the fireman, there are two sanders on the front buffers ready to sprinkle grit where the track has worn too smooth for good adhesion. There is also a man to operate the switchbacks and, on top of the coal bunker, a coal wallah, whose job is to break up the lumps for the furnace and hand them down to the fireman. With so many people sitting precariously on the engine, it is hardly surprising that the maximum speed is just 15mph and even this is rarely reached once the train leaves the plain. </p> <p>The railway is a vertical Victorian folly, a testimony to British engineering skills and imperial madness. It was built in 1879-81 by the Darjeeling Steam Tramway Company in response to the need for improved transport links to Darjeeling which was beginning to be recognised as a key tea plantation area and booming hill station for those escaping the Calcutta heat. The only connection to the plain was the old Hill Cart Road, still the only route for trucks, and the journey by tonga , the light two-wheel carts, was tortuous. </p> <p>But this was not exactly good railway territory. The expression \"hill\" is only used because of the contrast with the huge Himalayan mountains that seem to pop out of the sky when the mist disappears in Darjeeling but by any other reckoning, these are serious mountains, requiring an ascent of 7,000ft in 50 miles. The engineers avoided expensive tunnelling and, instead, hit upon a series of ingenious solutions that make travelling up the railway a unique experience. </p> <p>First, there are reverses. Where the hill is simply too narrow to accommodate a bend, the train chugs into a siding, the points are changed by one of the team sitting on the engine and the train then reverses up the next section. There are half a dozen of these switchbacks on the steepest parts of the hill which offer passengers the chance to jump off for a quick snap. Indeed, the whole journey is a bit like that. You can hardly get left behind since even the moderately fit could soon chase it down, so people get on and off all the time to stretch their legs or trigger their shutter buttons. </p> <p>The other wonderful eccentricities are the loops where the train goes round 360 degrees in order to gain height, like taking a deep breath before braving the steep incline up the side of the hill again. Because the gauge is so small and the speed so slow, the bends are very tight, and frequently you look out of the window at a sheer drop of several hundred metres down the hill. Accidents on the railway are rare, they tell you reassuringly, and at least there are no red lights to go through since there is absolutely no signalling. The trains meet each other at prearranged points where, briefly, the track is doubled. But, in truth, as the trains pootle up and down the hill so slowly but so noisily, there is no chance of a head-on crash. </p> <p>The topography of the railway has changed over the years as bits have been washed away in the monsoons and various reverses have been replaced or resited. Also, the railway was closed for 18 months when there were political troubles in the late 1980s as the dominant local Nepalese population fought for a measure of independence for the hills, which they duly won. </p> <p>It was a miracle that the line was reopened at the time as it is a heavy loss-maker and, having become part of Indian Railways at independence in 1948, it is dependent on an administration which really cannot be bothered with toy railways when there are 12 million people travelling on the main system every day. </p> <p>Because the journey is so slow, the train allows you to study the gradual changes in the environment as it first traverses the plain and then starts to go up the hill. The train starts at New Jalpaiguri (NJP) next to the main line station where the Darjeeling Mail, the overnight train from Calcutta, arrives in the morning. The first few miles are little different from countless other Indian rail journeys as the line passes through Siliguri, a sprawling town that has grown up because it is a junction. </p> <p>At Sukna, an hour out of NJP, the train starts to climb and the track, rather cruelly exposed in the hot plain, soon becomes shrouded in thick cooling forest. Although the steam engines are indeed like slightly oversize toys, they come into their own as they start to drag the little carriages up the hill, making the same wonderful noise as their big brothers and sisters did on Britain's railways 35 years ago and, indeed, on many of India's main lines until the late 1990s. </p> <p>By the time you reach Tindharia, nearly 3,000ft above sea level, the forest is thinning out and the views start to reflect the scale of the place. Soon after, the train reaches the best part, Agony Point, where the line seems to be playing a joke as it drags towards the precipice, just avoiding it with a bend so tight that in Britain it would have long ago been banned by the inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive. </p> <p>Kurseong, nearly a mile up, is the most significant town on the line and you pass so close to the stalls that shoplifting the green but tasty oranges out of the window is a temptation. By now the countryside is barren, at times even rocky and stark, but peppered with Buddhist monasteries and schools filled with smartly-dressed children in uniform. The train reaches its maximum height at the small town of Ghum before descending slightly into Darjeeling. </p> <p> It is the triumph of man and machine over nature that attracts steam enthusiasts from over the world to travel on the railway. I was travelling with a group of eccentrics from the Friends of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, an organisation formed in 1995 to support the railway in its endeavour to survive and flourish. </p> <p>But there is a downside to running a railway with century-old steam engines. They are unreliable and have a constant need for water, which is in short supply on the hill. This is one of the reasons why it takes eight or nine hours just to cover the 50 or so miles up to Darjeeling. The special train that took the Friends up the hill for the World Heritage celebrations took a staggering 17 hours. </p> <p>While the Friends were happy enough to take the slow train, the problem for the railway is that it needs to attract tourists to ensure its survival. Apart from the obsessives, how many people will put up with what must be the slowest rail journey in the world, even though it is also stunningly beautiful and amazingly cheap - just 20 rupees (30p) for the whole trip? Although the Indian Railways minister promised \u00a31m for investment at the inaugural celebrations, that will go mainly to replacing the worn-out track and repairing the locomotives, which, with each spare part needing to be engineered, is a financial bottomless pit. Given the tiny revenue from the fare box, and the fact that the railway employs 850 people, there will always be a need for massive subsidy. </p> <p>But that will be a good investment for the local economy if the railway can expand its appeal beyond the enthusiasts' market. Darjeeling is somewhat on its uppers, having had its heyday during the Raj and now finding itself having to compete for tourists with many other parts of Asia. The tea plantations are now run by Indians and the expats have largely left, which has reduced the number of Western visitors. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it does have several attractions to make the journey worthwhile. There is the sight of Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest mountain, which on a good day pops up as the train approaches the end station and which seems to stretch up improbably from the valley below, completely out of scale with the surrounding hills. Then there is the zoo which is mostly, like all zoos, quite sad except for the breeding colony where both red pandas and, most wonderfully, the snow leopards seem to flourish. </p> <p>There is the attraction of a couple of luxury hotels - the rather brash, refurbished New Elgin and the stately Windamere. The latter is set out on top of the hill rather like a Scottish laird's summer residence and offers a relatively cheap (\u00a360 a night full board including porridge for breakfast, unfortunately served with watery buffalo's milk) respite from the cold climate and the sheer exhaustion of travel in India. Darjeeling is cold, even in summer, and often shrouded in mist. On all four days of my stay, I rose at dawn to try to see the sun rising over the Himalayas, the most famous tourist attraction, but every day the mountains stayed hidden. </p> <p>Darjeeling needs the railway to make it special. The trick would be to speed up the journey, a difficult task given the age of the locomotives, or to offer special tourist trains which might stop off halfway up where, at the moment, there are only spartan local hotels. There is already a daily special train from Darjeeling down to Ghum costing a staggering 200 rupees (\u00a33) in specially refurbished coaches, but in reality that is a synthetic little trip compared with taking the normal train up the full length. </p> <p>The slow way up the hill is a very Indian experience. You may end up hungry, cold and splattered with soot, but the journey will have been an adventure, tinged with uncertainty about the ability of the train to drag itself up the hill.</p> <p><strong> Staying on the narrow </strong></p> <p><strong>Glacier Express </strong><br> St Moritz to Zermatt <br> Full-day journey across three mountain passes in the Alps.

      "bodyText": "To say the little train meanders up the hill to Darjeeling is being rather optimistic. Stutters, more like, although that is too cruel. Poodles, perhaps, or its near relative, pootles. One should, after all, be kind to the train for it - or at least the steam engine - is unfathomably old. It is an ancient relic built in the late 19th century that has miraculously survived into the 21st thanks largely to the fact that until a few years ago no one ever thought of closing it. Now, recently blessed with Unesco World Heritage status, the line's future seems assured. One also has to be gentle on the train because it is ridiculously small. They call it the toy train and the description is accurate. For those who know anything about trains, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is a 2ft gauge, less than half the normal width between the rails, and consequently the carriages are small, a squeeze for any westerner with a broader than average beam. The locomotives are painted blue, just the same colour as Thomas the Tank Engine, and the resemblance does not end there: the engines teem with life, giving them a personality. Each one, as it chugs up the hill, has a team of half a dozen men perched on every protruding part - as well as the driver and the fireman, there are two sanders on the front buffers ready to sprinkle grit where the track has worn too smooth for good adhesion. There is also a man to operate the switchbacks and, on top of the coal bunker, a coal wallah, whose job is to break up the lumps for the furnace and hand them down to the fireman. With so many people sitting precariously on the engine, it is hardly surprising that the maximum speed is just 15mph and even this is rarely reached once the train leaves the plain. The railway is a vertical Victorian folly, a testimony to British engineering skills and imperial madness. It was built in 1879-81 by the Darjeeling Steam Tramway Company in response to the need for improved transport links to Darjeeling which was beginning to be recognised as a key tea plantation area and booming hill station for those escaping the Calcutta heat. The only connection to the plain was the old Hill Cart Road, still the only route for trucks, and the journey by tonga , the light two-wheel carts, was tortuous. But this was not exactly good railway territory. The expression \"hill\" is only used because of the contrast with the huge Himalayan mountains that seem to pop out of the sky when the mist disappears in Darjeeling but by any other reckoning, these are serious mountains, requiring an ascent of 7,000ft in 50 miles. The engineers avoided expensive tunnelling and, instead, hit upon a series of ingenious solutions that make travelling up the railway a unique experience. First, there are reverses. Where the hill is simply too narrow to accommodate a bend, the train chugs into a siding, the points are changed by one of the team sitting on the engine and the train then reverses up the next section. There are half a dozen of these switchbacks on the steepest parts of the hill which offer passengers the chance to jump off for a quick snap. Indeed, the whole journey is a bit like that. You can hardly get left behind since even the moderately fit could soon chase it down, so people get on and off all the time to stretch their legs or trigger their shutter buttons. The other wonderful eccentricities are the loops where the train goes round 360 degrees in order to gain height, like taking a deep breath before braving the steep incline up the side of the hill again.

      "body": "<p>Canada has long been known for its skiing. Now it wants the same for its golf, and both the scale of the ambition and the geographical setting are on a par. </p> <p>\"No matter how much you spoon the ball, you'll never see it rise above these mountains,\" says Scotsman Peter Smith, director of Greywolf, an award-winning course opened two years ago next door to some of the World Cup ski runs of Panorama, three hours west of Calgary. You follow his gaze up fir- and pine-clad scarps to 10,000ft peaks. Many are snow-capped, though this is August. If there is a golfing heaven, this is surely the Rocky Mountain version of it. </p> <p>But back on the sensible earth of the sixth tee you realise that purgatory may well come first. The sixth is what these days they refer to as a signature hole, which can as easily mean the write-off of a perfectly good medal round or a swaggering par. </p> <p>Cliffhanger, it is called, and off the blue tees it is 175 yards over the vertical rock cliffs of Hopeful Canyon to an island green that, if you overhit, will only serve as a trampoline for your ball to whistle into belts of firs. (Yes, to this day, my Titleist is somewhere far out there.) Non-golfers gladly take an electric cart to Cliffhanger's coffee shop just to relish your walk-on part. </p> <p>From here, the course crosses vast terraces below sheer cliff or tumbling forest, over creek, lake, boulder and sand trap. What you have to remember, says Peter Smith, as you sight one of those inevitable long putts, is that any swing is mostly towards the valley. And through the green, allow for the thinner atmosphere by taking one or even two clubs less. </p> <p>And another Smith tip - bunkers are designed as signposts, not potholes of club-hurling hell as he knew from Carnoustie days. </p> <p>Sometimes you can disturb a brown or black bear napping in a bunker. On the 15th, another delightful par three, this time over a lake, an elk the size of a pony lapped away disdainfully as my ball landed with a plop on the green beyond. Under local rules, if it had hit the elk (heaven forbid!) I could have replayed the shot without penalty. If I'd landed in its dung, I could have dropped within a club's length (also without penalty). </p> <p>Golf has always been strong here in Canada with more golfers per capita than any other country in the world, and the emergence of Mike Weir in the Tiger Woods echelon is no fluke. But, until now, in tourist terms it has been a country more famous for its snow than its fairways, not least with the British, who have discovered in Whistler- Blackcomb the kind of skiing they fly far to enjoy. </p> <p>Panorama links hotels, condos, town homes, inns, horse trails, hiking trails, mountain bike trails, hot pools, cold pools and white-water adventure in a C$250 million enterprise barely thinkable from the tentative scene of 20 years ago. Then the unemployment-struck region bravely hosted a World Cup downhill on the thinnest of budgets. </p> <p>Greywolf took three years of rock-blasting, irrigation, drainage and soil movement - some of it hauled 10 hours by truck. It is hard to believe that Greywolf was in service so quickly - like all outstanding courses, it seems to have always been part of the landscape. </p> <p>Snow is not a problem, providing a welcome winter quilt for a short but fast growing season, and only interrupting play between November and April. \"What's more\", a St Anne (Quebec) greenkeeper told me, as we met quite by chance in the Jacuzzi of the Banff Springs Hotel, \"the grass is unstressed - none of the diseases we have in our longer, dryer season.\" He sounded envious. </p> <p>The Rockies, strictly, are only the most westerly of a set of bony mountain ridges pushed up by the Pacific plate and running from Alaska and the Yukon down in to Mexico. Four hours west of Vancou ver, and a plane hop out of Calgary from the east, lies the Okanagan Valley. Its lake, 90 miles from north to south and a couple of miles wide, is served by the towns of Vernon, Kelowna and Penticton. \"South of here, it's real high desert,\" they tell you. Ski mountains, too, are not far away, but Kelowna's harbour could be a smaller Cannes, and hills, canyons, vineyards and apple, cherry and peach orchards are a more immediate backdrop to six good courses. </p> <p>Beyond the Monashee, Selkirk and Purcell mountains, ski and tee are also inextricably mixed. Kimberley, once a simple mining town, is busily turning itself in to an all-purpose, year-round resort, with two new courses: St Eugene Mission, with stunning views of Fisher Peak, and Trickle Creek, with a sensational mountain backdrop. The Marriot Trickle Creek Lodge is just a precursor to a major resort development scheme. </p> <p>Hereabouts are the Columbia River headwaters. If you boast to an American at Astoria, Oregon, that you have five times driven a golf ball across the Columbia, including twice with one tee shot at the par 3 fifth, he will no doubt look at you in amazement. He only knows it for the vast estuary flowing in to the Pacific after a 2,000- mile loop from the BC hinterland. But a little up Route 95, the Riverside course at the 140-room Fairmont Hot Springs Resort offers you just that golfing challenge. </p> <p>Everywhere, buggies are cheap - and often compulsory - on mountain courses otherwise demanding Chris Bonington legs from green to following tee. Many carry mini-navigational screens, offering distance measures for club choice. </p> <p>At the brand new Eagle Ranch, part of a $350 million development at Invermere, a few miles north on 95, I try some Callaway steel heads and not only drive the ravine to the marker post but, with a 4-iron, hit the pin for a birdie - my hole of a 165-hole trip. It's a 400-yarder so my dis tances can only be put down to the thinner atmosphere - and just maybe the clubs. </p> <p>From Panorama it's a two-hour drive over the Alberta border to Banff, where pouring rain has closed the famous Banff Springs course. Too bad to miss the Devil's Cauldron, but it gives me the chance to sample Silver Tip at Canmore, the No 2 Best New Course of 1999 after Greywolf. It is a new-style mountain creation, with fantastic views across the valley to Canmore's famous Three Sisters peaks. It features 580 bunkers and, off the back tees, the highest course rating in Canada. As a panoramic view, the ninth hole, at 5,100ft, lives in the memory (together with the birdie at Eagle Ranch).</p> <p><strong>Fairway facts</strong></p> <p>Canadian green fees vary from around \u00a325 to \u00a380 depending on course and on low-, mid- and high-season rates, and allowing C$2 to \u00a31. In Silver Tip, the low season runs May 1-23 and late October and costs C$75; the mid season (May 24 - June 8; October 2 - 9) costs C$105 (twilight rate C$75); and the high season (June 9 - October 1) costs C$125 (twilight C$85). Power carts, including navigational screen for club choice, inclusive. Rental clubs: C$40. Only soft (non-metal) spikes. </p> <p>Courses have colour-coded tees, longer or shorter to match skills. Silver Tip is 7,200 yards at its longest reducing in three further stages to 5,131 yards for the forward tees. As in the US, Slope Ratings enable you to adjust your handicap to individual courses and their degree of difficulty from different tees. Silver Tip's 144 off the 6,585-yard green tees gave me three extra shots on my regular handicap of 19.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Frontier Travel (020-8776 8709) offers customised trips comprising four nights at Banff Springs Hotel and three nights at Triple Creek Lodge, inclusive of five rounds of golf, scheduled flights London-Calgary, and medium-size car hire for an average price of \u00a31,414pp. The equivalent Okanagan Valley tour, staying at the Grand Okanagan is \u00a31,318 with flights to Vancouver.

      "body": "<p><strong>Andros</strong></p> <p>Andros is the second largest Cycladic island with a mountainous, forested interior speckled with country estates. Apart from its physical attractions - lush one side, barren on the other - its proximity to Piraeus, the main port of Athens, means that Greece's yachting fraternity can crew up and be sipping ouzo in the shade before you can say Captain Corelli's mandolin. </p> <p>It's unlikely that you'll spot little Athina Onassis eating a gyro or King Constantine drying his trunks, but you will get to watch droves of B-list celebs pretending to escape the Greek paparazzi on Mykonos. </p> <p> <strong> Winning features</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Ship-owning art patrons the Goulandris opened up a private museum of modern art in the capital, Chora, (Kairis Square, Wed-Mon, 10am-2pm and 6pm-9pm). It exhibits Greek and international artists. </p> <p>\u0095 There are no shabby facades in Chora; the town is littered with grand neoclassical mansions. Even the streets are paved with marble slabs. </p> <p>\u0095 Batsi, the biggest resort, has a definite charm with a maze of narrow lanes and white steps. Plus, there's an open-air cinema in summer, showing films in English. Those who want to see and be seen mingle in the many chic cocktail bars around town. </p> <p>\u0095 Walking is a big draw on Andros; a gentle combination of mountains and valleys, and there are monasteries and 70 villages to explore - the honeypot village of Stenies, one of the prettiest, closes off its fragrant tree-lined streets to traffic. Also, the Meltemi wind keeps everyone cool in hottest months. </p> <p> <strong> Where to sunbathe:</strong> The beaches are superb - from long sandy strands to small coves. On the east coast, Kybi is a fine sandy beach just south of the lacklustre main port of Gavrion. For an all-over tan, try Delavoyas beach. On the west side, just north of Chora, is Gialya near the all-important fish taverna. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> In Delavoyas, the Country House has two bedrooms, sleeps up to five and is a rustic self-catering option just minutes from the beach. Sunvil Holidays (020-8568 4499) charges \u00a3398 for a week. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there:</strong> An even shorter hop from Athens new airport, one hour by hydrofoil from Rafina port, two hours by ferry. </p> <p><strong>Lefkada</strong></p> <p> A combination of \"real\" villages and stunning beaches is hard to come by. But Lefkada manages it because agriculture is bigger than tourism. The heart of the island is thick with olive groves and it is common to see women at work dressed in the traditional lace scarf and brown clothing. </p> <p>The west coast is one long line of shaggy white cliffs, the east is green and indented. You can guess where all the tourist action is and which bits are studded with \"unspoilt beaches\". In peak season, Lefkada's coastlines turn neon-coloured as sailors and windsurfers breeze in on wind and wave. </p> <p> <strong> Winning features</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Cottage industries, such as lace-making and tapestry, aren' t propped up by government initiatives. So visitors can actually buy original pieces without feeling as if they are in some twee theme park. </p> <p>\u0095 Nidri, the busiest resort town is still the sort of place where you can dawdle in a waterfront caf\u00e9 but has a great selection of shops, tavernas and discos. </p> <p>\u0095 Lefkada faces Aristotle Onassis' private island of Skorpios, where he wed Jackie O in 1968. Day cruises promise to take you there for a sunbathe but it's actually prohibited. </p> <p>\u0095 Just a 45-minute walk from Nidri is a hamlet called Rachi with a lovely waterfall and a pool to swim in. </p> <p>\u0095 Surprisingly, routine Greek island fare like kalamari is usually frozen. But due to the prowess of Lefkada's fishing fleet, there's a wider choice of fresh fish (or even lobster in the charming village of Sivota). </p> <p> <strong> Where to sunbathe:</strong> Vasiliki on the south coast draws the bulk of the surfers. Once a pretty fishing port with an average beach, now a cool resort with great conditions for beginners and experts alike. Meanwhile, the west coast gems are Porto Katsiki, Egremni or Agios Nikitas, best reached by caique. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay: </strong> The uber dwelling is Italian-designed Ulysses's cottages. Situated on the bay of Syvota, they all have gin-and-tonic terraces with sweeping sea views. Flagged steps bring you to a private swimming platform with sunloungers. Fresh village bread delivered daily. Greek Islands Club (020-8232 9780), \u00a3598, including car hire and maid. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there:</strong> Via Athens to Preveza airport (or direct charter), then 45 minutes' drive approximately. </p> <p><strong>Alonnisos</strong></p> <p> Everyone seems tempted to describe the island of Alonnisos, in the Sporades, as Skiathos 20 years ago, which infers that they are girding their loins for a tourist influx. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, there's a subtle balance between this island and it's wilder sister with the airport and throbbing nightlife. With Skopelos as a halfway stage, people flit between them depending on their daily appetites. </p> <p>Since it's in one of Greece's few designated marine parks, every seasoned sailor with a half decent craft charts a course here on weekends. The old town, Alonissos, is one of those hilltop numbers where you can sit in a square or just gaze out to sea. Drive the 13 miles to the other tip through forests, keeping your eye out for hawks and falcons. </p> <p> <strong> Winning features</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Fabulous shades of water, especially around the sea caves. Try to spot a shy monk seal or dolphin. </p> <p>\u0095 The bustling little port of Patitiri is a gem. </p> <p>\u0095 Overall, the interesting stone cottages instead of faceless hotels make you feel at home. And the interior is a maze of wild goat tracks cutting through plum tree orchards. </p> <p> <strong> Where to sunbathe:</strong> Take your pick of wonderful beaches, such as Marpounda and Megalos Mourtias. At least seven more are reached by caiques operating from Patitiri. Sheltered bays make safe swimming for watchful parents. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> To hear the constant lapping of the waves, at a spot called Barbakis, 15km north of Alonissos old town, and a few kilometres from the fishing hamlet of Kalamakia: Starfish Villa (one bed) is so close to the beach you can close the door and cast off at the same time. Greek Islands Club (020-8232 9780), \u00a3549, including car hire and maid. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there: </strong> Via Athens to Skiathos airport (or direct charter), then one hour hydrofoil crossing. </p> <p><strong> Crete</strong></p> <p> Falasarna is one of those places that spell beach life. Clap eyes on it, and you can envision bolting your entire holiday around it. </p> <p>A 3km-long sandy cape on the fertile west coast of Crete, Falasarna was voted second best beach in the country by Greeks. Until a few years ago, there was nothing here - now there are a handful of rooms and a few snack bars. </p> <p>In summer, the white sand turns pink, as tiny fragments of shell are washed up. Big boulders break up beach monotony and create rock pools. The waters remain tropically warm. </p> <p>This corner of Crete is best covered by a motorbike and a tent, but if that's not your thing, a car will do. And, when scorching skin needs some respite from the sun, get hold of a copy of Unexplored Crete (Road Editions, \u00a312.99) and get moving. </p> <p> <strong> Winning features</strong></p> <p>The fact that you can behave like a slob for at least a few days. That means heaving off the beach and depositing yourself at the nearest shady table. Next step is ordering big bottles of beer (any), accompanied by platters of chips, tsatziki and grilled octopus. Siestas will inevitably get longer as the week wears on. </p> <p>\u0095 Dining options are limited, but since the vegetables are straight from the huge greenhouses up yonder, you can expect a good Greek salad. </p> <p>\u0095 Crete's last wilderness, the Gramvoussa peninsula, is next door. Hop on a motorbike (or take a tour boat from Kastelli) and enjoy the views from the fort where the Greek revolutionaries chose to base their operations. </p> <p>\u0095 For big city contrast, there's Hania. Take in the old Venetian port, Turkish quarter, and Marseille-style food market for stocking up the goodies like herbs, cheeses and honey. Dine at harbourside Dinos for fish dinners, or try a sea urchin salad. Best all rounder and easier on the wallet is Karnagio. In the evenings, try Thalassino Ageri at the chic Halepa Tannery section. </p> <p> <strong> Where else to sunbathe:</strong> Balos Beach, on the peninsula, is wide with fine white sand, facing two desert islands. It's perfect for some unadulterated snorkelling in shallow, warm waters (and a prime camping spot). A few huts morph into snack stands in summer, which come and go according to whim. </p> <p>Roumeli beach is further away on the south coast, but worth a trip to see the river flowing into a palm-ringed beach. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> A frisbee throw away from Falasarna, overlooking the widest part of the beach. The very simple but adequate Panorama Rooms (built three years ago) offer a late breakfast on the terrace. Hidden Greece (020-7839 2553) offers B&amp;B here for \u00a3411, including car hire and scheduled flights. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there:</strong> Fly via Athens to Hania (or direct charter), then one-hour drive west. </p> <p> <strong>The Pelion</strong></p> <p> There is no other blend of culture and beauty anywhere else in the country quite like this mountainous peninsula in central Greece. A new shortcut to paradise, via an old military airport at Volos, has shaved three or four hours off the journey, and consequently some of its resorts have entered British brochureland as \"a Greek Cornwall\". </p> <p>Pelion juts out towards Skiathos and the Sporades beyond, rising to 5,400ft above the sea and, according to mythology, was once the summer home of the 12 Olympian Gods and the Centaurs. The wild easterly coast is cloaked with chestnut, oak and apple trees, which plunge down to Caribbean-style beaches. The west side is a swathe of gently shelving olive groves, edged with shorter, shingly beaches. Having kids usually forces you to settle for one side or the other - but you can criss-cross the 24 or so peachy villages in two loops or odd day trips. </p> <p>With self-imposed building restrictions and restoration of nearly all the old 17th-century mansions, Pelion villages are des-res, with the odd millionaire's row. The downside is that room rates are wallet draining. But you do get those touches like real linen sheets. </p> <p> <strong> Winning features</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Strolling around perfectly-kept villages such as Makrynitsa and Milies; being able to sit in a shady square on a real wooden chair, not a plastic one. </p> <p>\u0095 The lushness of the area is breathtaking; a short stroll along one of the hundreds of restored mule tracks and you will hear deep canyons reverberate with the sound of gushing streams. Within minutes you're surrounded by thickly-forested cliffs, home to countless birds and wildlife. </p> <p>\u0095 The food is legendary, so tavernas such as Drossia in Vizitsa are always full. Locally-reared produce goes into every dish; specialities are kreatopita , meat pie, and fruit desserts. Wines are organic. </p> <p>\u0095 Having coffee and sweets in Argalasti square at sunset watching locals playing tavli. </p> <p> <strong> Where to sunbathe:</strong> Mylopotamos is one of the most beautiful with two tavernas overlooking it. Fakistra is less accessible, ideal for escapists. Papa Nero, Affissos or Horto. </p> <p> <strong> Where to stay:</strong> In the perfectly-formed hamlet of Damouchari, with its one harbour, one beach and three fish tavernas. It's a one-family town, so you may as well stay in Apostolos' unique Hotel Damouchari - a cluster of nautical studios and maisonettes in manicured grounds. Kleopatra is a wacky bar that stages live music gigs. Tapestry Holidays (020-8235 7788), \u00a3550 B&amp;B. </p> <p>Alternatively, on the tranquil shores of Horto, <a href=\"http://www.sunsail.com\">Sunsail's Leda Club</a> (0239 222 2222) offers sailing and beach action (adults only outside school hols) for \u00a3410 half-board, including use of equipment. </p> <p> <strong> Getting there:</strong> Via Thessaloniki or Athens, a four- or five-hour drive respectively. Charters fly direct to Volos, with two- to three-hour transfers.</p> <p>\u0095 All prices quoted are per person for one week in May/June and include flights and accommodation.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, is a conspiracy theorist. He believes that a shadowy elite of bankers and industrialists and politicians are plotting in secret to take over the world, disarm gun enthusiasts and implement a sinister New World Order - a world government that will destroy anyone who disobeys. McVeigh considered the Murrah building in Oklahoma City to be the local headquarters of the New World Order.</p> <p>Sure, McVeigh was fully aware that innocent secretaries and receptionists would be killed as a result of the massive truck bomb he detonated on April 19, 1995. But he was a keen Star Wars fan and he compared those innocents to the \"space-age clerical workers inside the Death Star. Those people weren't storm troopers. But they were vital to the operations of the Evil Empire. And when Luke Skywalker blew up the Death Star, the movie audiences cheered. The bad guys were beaten. That was all that really mattered.\"</p> <p>It is, therefore, churlish of McVeigh to scornfully dismiss - as crazy paranoid nuts - the legions of conspiracy theorists who believe that the truth of the Oklahoma City bombing has yet to be officially recognised. McVeigh is seething about this inside his death row cell. He is due to be executed on May 16. He feels the conspiracy theories are tainting his impending martyrdom. \"You can't handle the truth,\" he has said. \"And the truth is that it is pretty scary that one guy can do this all alone.\"</p> <p>The conspiracy theories centre on a bizarre white separatist encampment on the Oklahoma/Arkansas border called Elohim City and two of its regular visitors: a flamboyant neo-Nazi called Dennis Mahon and an extraordinary German called Andy Strassmeir. McVeigh says the Elohim City conspiracy theories are nonsense, a red herring. But I didn't know what to think. They seemed pretty convincing to me. Perhaps I am becoming a conspiracy nut. Whatever, I wanted to meet the alleged co-conspirators. It would, at least, be interesting to ask them how it felt to be widely considered, by conspiracy theorists, to be the hidden hands behind the Oklahoma City bombing.</p> <p>It was a Monday morning in early April. Dennis Mahon was jumpy and on the run in Arizona. \"It drives you crazy,\" he said. \"Thousands think I was involved. I've started to believe it myself. Maybe I was there. Maybe they brainwashed me and I forgot about it. Maybe I can get hypnotised and remember it. Everybody said I was there. Everybody said I drove the truck. They saw me.\"</p> <p>This is true. In the immediate aftermath of the bombing, many passers-by claimed to have seen McVeigh in Oklahoma City with unknown others. One witness drew a sketch of a John Doe who looked remarkably like how Dennis Mahon might look in dark glasses and a pencil moustache.</p> <p>\"Maybe there's somebody out there who looks like me,\" said Dennis. \"I'm just about ready to turn myself in and tell them, 'Okay motherfuckers, I did it'. But I didn't.\" Then Dennis showed me his scar - the result, he said, of a stress-related intestinal infection.</p> <p>But for all of this Dennis Mahon seemed secretly thrilled to be a central player in the alternative history of the Oklahoma bombing. Columbia Pictures is even considering making a movie of the story I am about to tell. \"It'll be a hell of a good movie,\" he said. \"I hope Tom Berenger plays me. But one guy said Danny DeVito's going to play me. That'll devastate me. I'll leave the country.\"</p> <p>Dennis peered through the curtains of our secret rendezvous location: Room 315 of the Hampton Inn near Phoenix airport. \"The Feds are on my tail!\" he stammered. \"The bastard sons of the FBI followed me here. See that white car?\"</p> <p>\"Why are they following you?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Well, Tim McVeigh did all his training over there,\" he said, pointing west to Kingman, Arizona. \"And he's going to be executed. And they're afraid there might be retaliation for that. And there very well might be. There very, very, very well might be.\"</p> <p>Dennis Mahon is a veteran neo-Nazi. He was famous before the Oklahoma bombing conspiracy theories. When you see him in old Ku Klux Klan recruitment videos from the 80s , he looks striking and quick-witted. Now he is jowly, the spitting image of the actor John Goodman.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I'm an old guy now,\" says Dennis. \"I'm an old comrade. I've seen changes. More lone wolfism. One man one act. These stupid Klan guys want to be circus clowns. And the Klan's targets are just little negroes. And then they get drunk in a pub and talk about it. You've got to raise your sights a little bit. If you're going to get 10 years for calling somebody a nigger, or throwing a rock through a synagogue window, you might as well go and do a McVeigh. And I think the kids are learning that.\"</p> <p>Dennis Mahon glanced out of the window at the white car. \"I don't believe they can hear us because . . .\" He paused. \"Did you get the room at the last minute?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Well, I think we're okay,\" he said.</p> <p>Dennis sat on the bed. \"I'd never heard of a Tim McVeigh,\" he said. \"I'd heard of a Tim Tuttle. Tim Tuttle was a real good patriot. Tim Tuttle was a highly decorated army guy from the Gulf War and he was travelling through the area and people wanted me to meet him.\"</p> <p>\"Did you meet Tim Tuttle?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" said Dennis. \"I met Tim Tuttle, but I didn't know he was alias Tim McVeigh. I met him at gun shows. He sold military stuff, knives, gun parts, camouflage uniforms. I remember he had real short hair and real intense eyes and the real long narrow nose like yours.\" Dennis scrutinised, and misinterpreted, my Jewish nose.</p> <p>\"It's a good nose,\" said Dennis. \"Don't get me wrong. Better than mine. Mine's been broke. And we talked about Waco. And I said, 'What comes around goes around. If they keep doing this terrorism on our people, terrorism's going to happen to them.' \"</p> <p>\"That's what you said?\"</p> <p>\"That's what I said to him. He said, 'Probably. Probably so.' \"</p> <p>\"Carol Howe testified that she was at your house when Tim Tuttle telephoned you shortly before the Oklahoma bomb,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Yeah, well,\" said Dennis, sharply. \"That was another Tim. Okay? Another Tim. His name was Tim Buttle.\"</p> <p>We talked about Carol Howe - about the strange love affair at the heart of the conspiracy theories. Carol was a Tulsa society girl and a champion horse rider. She attended private schools and won some local beauty contests. Her father Bob was an oil executive. Her mother Aubyn was a charity hostess. But Carol got in with a druggy crowd and she ended up jumping off a roof and breaking her feet. While she was convalescing from her injuries, she began to idly telephone the local \"Dial-A-Racist\" hotline and listen to the recorded messages: \"The international corporations and Jews and banks control America, and they're out to enslave and destroy the white race.\" She fell in love with the voice as she lay in her sick bed. The voice belonged to Dennis Mahon. She sought him out.</p> <p>\"I met her in a restaurant in Tulsa,\" said Dennis, \"and she comes on crutches. Here's a beautiful young woman who's really in bad shape - you know, physically - hobbling round on crutches trying to fight for her race. And my heart went out to her. She was strikingly beautiful and highly intelligent. Super high IQ. I think she had an IQ of 130. Way up there. She was a lot smarter than I was. She was a very rich girl, a debutante. I saw her house. Six bedrooms. Five car garage. Very wealthy.\"</p> <p>Within minutes of meeting Carol, Dennis had formulated some big plans for her. \"I was going to get her on Oprah. Most of our women are not very intelligent. All they can say is 'nigger this' and 'nigger that'. She could have been our Aryan spokeswoman.\"</p> <p>\"Did you fall in love with her?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"I tried not to, I really did,\" said Dennis. \"I tried to keep it on a professional level. But it was very hard. She was 23 years old. And she had a big swastika tattoo on her arm. I got a bit weak. I did fawn over her. And, yes, I had an intimate relationship with her. I finally said, 'Let's just forget about this whole thing and get married and have children.' \"</p> <p>\"Would you have given up neo-Nazism for her?\"</p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" said Dennis. \"In order to raise a family you have to make pretty good money. But no. She was like a Patty Hearst. She wanted to get into the guns and the explosives.\" So Dennis made Carol some bombs.</p> <p>\"We let them off out in the woods,\" said Dennis. \"And she was . . .\" He broke off. His face flushed red. \"She couldn't make love to me fast enough after that. She loved the bombs.\"</p> <p>\"She testified that you raped her,\" I said, \"and that's why you split up.\"</p> <p>\"Well, she's a lying little snitch,\" said Dennis. \"What really happened was that I finally got so tired. I knew that eventually she was going to make a bomb and hurt herself real bad and I'd be drawn into it. And I would have gone to jail.\"</p> <p>Dennis said it was an amicable split. (Carol testified that he threatened to kill her.) Dennis said he wanted to see her happy. He wanted to introduce her to eligible boys. So he took her to a place called Elohim City. \"It's a white separatist community,\" said Dennis. \"They're fundamentalists, but it's really nice. Lots of good single men out there.\"</p> <p>Elohim City is, for conspiracy theorists, the linchpin of the story. I have been told many times - by conspiracy-minded relatives of bombing victims, by local journalists and Oklahoma City councillors - that Elohim City is a terrorist training camp. It was certainly the hideout of the Aryan Republican Army, who committed a two-year spree of bank robberies using explosives. And it was home, for a year and a half, to a man called Andy Strassmeir.</p> <p>\"He was this tall, tough-looking guy,\" said Dennis. \"A deep German accent. They called him Andy the German. I learned that his visa had run out and he was head of security out at Elohim City. I got to be pretty good friends with him. He told me he was very highly trained. Like our Green Berets. Or your SAS. He really knew his stuff. And he had trained a lot of good people at Elohim City. One time he had almost 30 young men, and women too, drilling them in full soldier drill. And they did just as good as any highly trained army unit in this country.\"</p> <p>\"That makes Elohim City sound like a training camp,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Well,\" he said, \"after Waco they were very fearful they could be next.\"</p> <p>So Dennis took Carol to Elohim City to meet boys. But there was something that he didn't know. After Dennis had threatened to kill Carol, she reported him to the police. Then the local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms - the ATF, the same government agency that raided Waco - approached Carol and asked her to become an undercover informant, and spy for them on Dennis and Elohim City. She agreed.</p> <p>In the months leading up to the Oklahoma bombing, Carol filed a series of reports to the ATF. In one, she reported that Andy Strassmeir had declared, \"It's time to go to war,\" and, \"It's time to start bombing federal buildings.\" In another, she reported that Strassmeir had travelled to Oklahoma City to case the Murrah building as a potential target. In a third, she reported that Elohim City's patriarch, Reverend Robert Millar, preached a Holy War against the Federal Government, and suggested that April 19 might be a good day to start that war.</p> <p>Immediately after the bombing, Carol Howe identified Timothy McVeigh as someone she saw walking through the Elohim City forests with Andy Strassmeir. She also testified that she overheard Dennis Mahon take a telephone call from \"Tim Tuttle\" - the alias McVeigh used. \"Carol had a lot of boyfriends at Elohim City,\" said Dennis. \"But she'd scare them off. You know. 'Hey! Let's make a bomb!' That kind of talk tends to scare guys away.\" Dennis paused. \"Especially when they may actually be planning something.\"</p> <p>\"I'm sorry?\" I said.</p> <p>This was an extraordinary thing for Dennis to say. Dennis remains to this day a close friend of the people at Elohim City. Until now, he has always denied that the community had anything to do with the Oklahoma City bombing. Was he now implying that they may have actually been involved?</p> <p>\"Before that bomb went off in Oklahoma City,\" said Dennis, \"they got rid of her. They told Carol to go back home. They said, 'We need to be by ourselves for a while.'\"</p> <p>\"Who said that to her?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Her last boyfriend broke up with her and said, 'Maybe you ought to go to Tulsa. Stay away for a while.' She was away from Elohim City for almost two months before the bomb went off. Which is probably a good thing.\"</p> <p>Dennis is a conspiracy theorist, but he said he doesn't believe the conspiracy theory that he was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing. \"I think Andy Strassmeir was,\" he said. \"Or at least he knew about it. I've been trying to contact him for years. I've always defended him. And now he won't return my phone calls. And I've been banned from Germany. Why is that? So I'm taking all the heat and he's run off to Germany.\"</p> <p>Dennis said that if Andy Strassmeir wasn't involved, perhaps a crack team of Iraqi Republican Guards were, acting under the orders of Saddam Hussein. \"There's quite a few Iraqis in Oklahoma,\" he said. \"Those guys are highly trained in improvised munitions and explosives. Whereas Tim was not. Certainly one of them could have trained Tim. There are 600 Iraqi Republican Guards in the Oklahoma City area.\"</p> <p>The conspiracy theories were getting crazier. I wanted to get back to the facts. And this is a fact: on the morning of April 19, 1995 - just as Timothy McVeigh's yellow Ryder truck packed with three 55-gallon drums of liquid nitromethane pulled up outside the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City - a death row prisoner in Arkansas called Richard Wayne Snell asked his guard if he could watch the TV news. The guard agreed. Snell was to be executed within hours. Getting to watch CNN was just about his final request. Snell had murdered a black state trooper called Louis Bryant and a pawn shop owner called William Stumpp, whom Snell had mistakenly believed to be Jewish.</p> <p>Snell had also plotted, in 1983, to blow up the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. He only abandoned the plan when the rocket-launcher he'd been practising with exploded in his hands. He took this as a sign that God didn't want him to go ahead with the plan. Snell's co-conspirator in the 1983 plot was a neo-Nazi called James Ellison, who lived at Elohim City and was, in fact, married to Reverend Millar's granddaughter.</p> <p>Within the more hard-core factions of the American militia movement, Snell was a hero and a martyr: a respected preacher and political prisoner. His supporters were outraged that the Arkansas governor had chosen April 19 for the execution date. They considered it a deliberate kick in the teeth.</p> <p>April 19 is holy day for anti-government activists and conspiracy theorists. On April 19, 1993, Federal agents ended the siege at Waco. David Koresh's Branch Davidian church went up in flames. On April 19, 1775, 400 British government troops attempted to disarm the citizens of Lexington, Massachusetts. A hundred colonists shot back, the first shots of the American Revolution, the \"shots heard around the world\". (When I visit American militias and patriots and neo-Nazis, they often ask me what I, a Brit, thinks of the Lexington uprising. I explain that I'm not au fait with the ins and outs. They are scandalised that our syllabus doesn't teach this pivotal moment in British history.) So executing Snell on April 19 was perceived to be an insult levelled at the American militia movement.</p> <p>The guard on death watch duty agreed to Snell's request. He turned on CNN, just as news was breaking of the bombing of the Murrah building. Snell had already warned his prison guards that his death would be avenged. And now, the penitentiary's death watch log noted, Richard Wayne Snell watched the breaking news and he \"smiled and chuckled and nodded\". Shortly afterwards, he was executed by lethal injection. His good friend and spiritual advisor, the Reverend Robert Millar, transported his body to its final resting place: Elohim City.</p> <p>After all I'd heard about Elohim City, I felt a little intimidated as I drove up into the Ozark mountains towards the community. I turned left at the covered bridge, the very spot where Timothy McVeigh had received a speeding ticket on October 12, 1993. McVeigh has always denied visiting Elohim City, but I couldn't imagine where else he could have been heading, out here in the middle of the dusty nothingness.</p> <p>In fact, only one official record links McVeigh to Elohim City: a telephone call he made on April 5, 1995, a fortnight before the bombing. He had bought a telephone calling card from the back pages of the Spotlight, the right-wing newspaper dedicated to seeking out and exposing the Bilderberg Group, the internationalist think tank believed by conspiracy theorists, McVeigh included, to be the shadowy elite that secretly rules the world. McVeigh used the phone card to make enquiries about where he might order a Ryder truck. Then he phoned Elohim City and asked to speak to \"Andy\". But Andy Strassmeir wasn't there. So McVeigh put the phone down again.</p> <p>My instructions were to pull up at Elohim City's entrance, stay in the car, and honk my horn until somebody came to fetch me. I did this. I honked and honked, intrusively breaking the silence. I wondered why I had to sit there and honk. Were people doing things that they didn't want a journalist to know about? Had they been told to stop doing whatever it was when the honking journalist arrived? So I felt intimidated as I sat there honking. And then the children of Elohim City suddenly appeared from nowhere and performed, for my benefit, an impressive and well rehearsed rendition of Riverdance. I clapped when it was over.</p> <p>Then Elohim City's resident chiropractor, Dr Buzz, offered me a cranial massage.</p> <p>\"No thanks,\" I said.</p> <p>Elohim City looked like something out of the Brothers Grimm. Brightly coloured elf type houses scattered the forest. The whole place would have resembled some new-age retreat, something like the Findhorn Foundation, if it wasn't for the fact that everyone was carrying semi-automatic rifles.</p> <p>Then I was invited into the meeting hall to sit in on a travelling soap salesman's presentation. He wanted to sell Elohim City soap powder and water-refining tablets. The women of the community and Reverend Millar, who looks like Santa Claus, fired questions at the salesman.</p> <p>\"We don't want chlorine,\" said Reverend Millar. \"Chlorine causes cancer.\"</p> <p>\"This isn't a game,\" said the salesman. \"This is serious. Cleanliness is serious.\"</p> <p>\"Health is important,\" said Reverend Millar.</p> <p>Reverend Millar is a conspiracy theorist, but he doesn't believe the conspiracy theory that he and his community were behind the Oklahoma City bombing. He thinks the bomb was planted by the government itself, a New World Order plot to turn the world against survivalists and implement gun-control legislation, much like Hitler's burning of the Reichstag.</p> <p>\"I think,\" he told me, \"it was an operation by the Zionists who have infiltrated our government agencies to disparage people like us. To give us a black eye.\"</p> <p>Carol Howe, he added, was \"a poor little rich girl. We fed her and housed her. I didn't know that $400 of my tax money was going to her with each visit. She was here several times. And then she went back and told things that were so far from the truth. She said we had prepared a bomb or discussed that sort of thing. Something very violent. And, as you can see, that's hardly typical of us here.\"</p> <p>\"Could you show me your cemetery?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Sure,\" he said.</p> <p>He took me down to a field at the bottom of a hill.</p> <p>\"How many people are buried here?\" I asked him.</p> <p>\"All the dead ones,\" he said. \"Ha ha! I'm sorry. Half-a-dozen.\" We looked at the headstones.</p> <p>\"This is my beloved wife,\" said Reverend Millar. \"We had been married 55 years and nine months. She was my sweetheart from college days. And here's Richard Wayne Snell. I guess this is the one you're interested in.\"</p> <p>Snell's headstone read, \"Rev Richard Wayne Snell. Patriot. May 21st 1930 - April 19th 1995\".</p> <p>\"It was a lethal injection,\" said Reverend Millar. \"I was there. He said, 'I am ready to go.' He died in full confidence of his hereafter. The idea that he was all excited about a bombing in Oklahoma City never passed between us.\"</p> <p>\"Why is he buried at Elohim City?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"He requested it,\" said Reverend Millar, a little sharply. \"He asked me to be his spiritual adviser. I visited him regularly in the years between the trial and the execution.\"</p> <p>\"April 19,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Very significant,\" he said. \"I had talked to the lieutenant governor of Arkansas and I suggested that it was a poor day to choose. I thought it would contribute to civic unrest.\" He paused, and softly added, \"The government can be more interested in demonstrating their control than they are in the interests of the nation that they represent.\"</p> <p>As we walked away from the cemetery, Reverend Millar happened to notice the Kansas licence plate of my hire car. \"Ah,\" laughed Reverend Millar. \"Just like the Ryder truck! You rented this in Kansas!\"</p> <p>There was a silence.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry?\" I said.</p> <p>Reverend Millar is a man who claims to know nothing about the Oklahoma City bombing, who says he needs to be reminded even of what date the explosion occurred. And now he was bringing up the most esoteric fact about McVeigh's plot - that the Ryder truck used for the bombing had been rented in Kansas. Was this a little playful clue, on his part, that there was more to Elohim City than meets the eye?</p> <p>Reverend Millar giggled.</p> <p>\"Just kidding,\" he said.</p> <p>There is a tiny strip club in Tulsa called Lady Godiva. It was once a salad bar, but the salads didn't take off so Floyd Ratcliffe bought the place up, painted it black, advertised for topless dancers, and now between 75 and 150 men attend each night. I sat in the back office with Floyd and his former wife Julie. \"My official title,\" said Julie to my notepad, \"is vice-president of Lady Godiva.\" She laughed. Then she stopped laughing and said, \"I'm not bullshitting you. Really.\"</p> <p>Behind us, a CCTV monitor screen flashed between the big bouncer doing neck exercises at the door, the bar, the stage, and the dressing room where the strippers went to change and apply make-up. A second CCTV monitor focused just on the dressing room.</p> <p>\"Do the women know they're being taped naked backstage?\" I asked Floyd. \"Why do you tape them?\"</p> <p>\"A lot of the girls,\" explained Floyd, \"are good girls. But it keeps down thievery. It keeps down drugs.\"</p> <p>On the night of April 8, 1995, two strippers from Arkansas got into a fight in Lady Godiva's dressing room - a fight that was taped by Floyd's CCTV camera. \"As it turns out,\" explained Floyd, \"one of the girls was nervous and had taken some pills before she got here, which made her hyper and made her clash with everybody.\"</p> <p>\"We usually erase the tapes after two weeks,\" added Julie. \"The reason why we kept this particular tape is because the cat fight was really quite humorous. So we kept it for entertainment.\"</p> <p>Some weeks after the cat fight occurred, the two warring strippers applied for jobs at an erotic bar in Arkansas. Their prospective employer had heard of the taped cat fight and so he asked Floyd to send him the cassette. \"He was trying to figure out whose fault the cat fight was,\" explained Floyd. \"Was it one of the girls' fault? Was it Lady Godiva's fault?\" So Floyd sent the tape to the club owner in Arkansas.</p> <p>\"So,\" said Floyd, \"he's looking at the tape to try and find out what went wrong, and I think, being a little bit nosy, he wanted to see the rest of the tape. And as he's watching the rest of the tape, he suddenly realises that he's seeing something quite extraordinary.\"</p> <p>This was true. There is a moment on the CCTV tape dated April 8, 1995, that could be seen to be incredible. Here is a transcript of that moment:</p> <p>Stripper 1 (leaning into the mirror, adjusting her costume): \"You know those three guys I'm sitting out there with? Well one of them says he's looking for a girl to fool around with tonight. Are you interested?\"</p> <p>Stripper 2: \"Well, okay, I'll figure out a way to scam them.\"</p> <p>The conversation becomes unintelligible for a while. The strippers talk about the three guys out front.</p> <p>Stripper 1: (unintelligible) \"... and one of them said, 'I'm a very smart man.' 'You are?' 'Yes, I am. And on April 19, 1995, you'll remember me for the rest of your life!' 'Oh really?' 'Yes, you will.' \"</p> <p>Stripper 1 laughs and starts to walk out of the dressing room. Then she turns back to the other and says, \"Weirdo!\"</p> <p>\"They were odd comments,\" said Julie. \"It just seemed odd. The girls thought, maybe they're going to come out with some big invention on April 19.\"</p> <p>\"But unfortunately,\" said Floyd, \"it turned out to be such a devastating event that they were in fact talking about.\" When the club owner in Arkansas realised the significance of the tape, he sent it back to Floyd and Julie. They telephoned the FBI. \"Several days later,\" said Floyd, \"a couple of agents came to the club, confiscated the tape, talked to the girls involved, and showed them pictures. The girls did identify three guys.\"</p> <p>\"McVeigh,\" said Julie. \"They identified McVeigh and Nichols and the other gentlemen. Um. Sloshmayer...\"</p> <p>\"Strassmeir?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Strassmeir,\" said Julie. \"Right. Excuse me. They all did identify that gentleman.\"</p> <p>\"And of course,\" I said, \"everyone's heard of McVeigh and Nichols. But not of Strassmeir.\"</p> <p>\"True,\" said Julie. \"But the girls did identify Strassmeir in the line-ups.\"</p> <p>\"It seems like the more we find out,\" said Floyd, \"the less we want to know. I don't know if it's a cover up. I don't know if they're trying to protect Strassmeir. There are just a lot of things I don't know. There are a lot of things that we will never know.\"</p> <p>There was a silence.</p> <p>\"It's a bad deal,\" said Floyd. Julie nodded. \"It's a bad deal all around. They were here. It's nothing to be proud of. If not here, someplace else.\"</p> <p>\"They wanted to see girls,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Sure,\" said Floyd. \"Sure. It's a semi-nude sexual-oriented type business, so we're quite popular in this part of the country.\"</p> <p>\"What did the FBI agents say?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"At the time, they said, 'We'll put it on the back burner and let it sit.' \" Floyd paused. \"Well, that's where it's been. This is five years later. And it's still on the back burner.\"</p> <p>Something else was noticed at Lady Godiva on the night of April 8. After one of the cat-fight strippers had been thrown out of the club by Floyd, she needed to urinate. Floyd wouldn't let her back in, so she urinated in the car park. She urinated right next to a yellow Ryder truck.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton promised that no stone would be left unturned. Two thousand Federal agents were assigned to the case, 20,000 individuals were interviewed. But the people at Elohim City were never questioned. Andy Strassmeir was never questioned. Surely they could at least have questioned him.</p> <p>It turns out that Andy Strassmeir's father is Gunther Strassmeir, Helmut Kohl's Secretary of State, a man known as the \"architect of German reunification\". Andy Strassmeir received military intelligence training at the Bundeswehr Academy in Hanover. In the light of this new knowledge, Reverend Millar now believes that Carol Howe was not the only undercover federal informant working at Elohim City.</p> <p>\"Strassmeir,\" he said, \"didn't contribute to community harmony. We had a little lady here. She was 80 years old. She'd feed him. She liked Andy. She cared for him. But when she wanted some painting done, he wanted to get paid by the hour. He acted like he was without financial resources. But whenever he went to buy something, he had the credit cards to buy the best.\" Reverend Millar paused. \"We do know,\" he added, \"that Andy contacted an anti-terrorist agency here in the United States when he first landed.\" Andy Strassmeir is now back in Germany, living with his parents.</p> <p>In the light of Carol Howe's undercover reports to the ATF, the American government considered launching a raid on Elohim City in the months before the Oklahoma City bombing. But they abandoned the plan. I asked FBI special agent Bob Ricks why they changed their minds. (Incidentally, Ricks was one of the special agents in charge of the siege at Waco. McVeigh had originally considered killing Ricks - or a Waco and Ruby Ridge sniper called Lon Horiuchi - instead of blowing up the Murrah building. But he decided that the Murrah would make more of an impact.) \"Why did we abandon the raid on Elohim City?\" said Ricks. \"We didn't want another Waco.\"</p> <p>There is a terrible irony to that decision. The American government's paranoid fear, and the reason why they originally raided Waco, was that they believed David Koresh might launch a terrorist attack on mainstream America. If you believe the Oklahoma conspiracy theories - if you believe that this story is more than just a series of coincidences - you are left with a startling conclusion. Had the raid on Elohim City not been abandoned, the Oklahoma City bombing might never have happened.</p> <p>The conspiracy theories inevitably reach a chilling conclusion: something that the theorists are disinclined to state publicly, fearful that the general public might consider them paranoid lunatics. They ask themselves why every member of the ATF based at the Murrah building survived the bombing. The ATF office was one of McVeigh's chief targets. Most of the Bureau's employees didn't turn up for work that morning. The conspiracy theorists put two and two together. Perhaps Strassmeir had tipped them off about the bombing in advance, and they incompetently failed to stop it happening. Perhaps they planned a sting operation, but it somehow went awry. Perhaps they have been covering this fact up ever since.</p> <p>Timothy McVeigh says he was 1,000 miles away from Lady Godiva on April 8. He says he was at the Imperial Motel in Kingman, Arizona. He says the conspiracy theorists are crazy, and he only ever met Andy Strassmeir once, at a gun show. He says he never visited Elohim City. He admits he telephoned the community on April 5, and asked to speak to Andy, but only because he thought that Elohim City might have been a suitable hideout for him after the bombing.</p> <p>One wonders why, if this story is true, McVeigh is protecting Strassmeir - an undercover informant. Does he fear reprisals against his family if he spills the beans? Is he embarrassed that he was suckered by a federal employee? Does he want to be considered a lone wolf, a martyr?</p> <p>McVeigh's aim, in blowing up the Murrah building, was to strike at the heart of the New World Order. And now conspiracy theorists are beginning to believe that the New World Order itself might have played a role in the conspiracy. McVeigh is seething about this in his death row cell. He will consequently be executed, on May 16, an unsatisfied man.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, is a conspiracy theorist. He believes that a shadowy elite of bankers and industrialists and politicians are plotting in secret to take over the world, disarm gun enthusiasts and implement a sinister New World Order - a world government that will destroy anyone who disobeys. McVeigh considered the Murrah building in Oklahoma City to be the local headquarters of the New World Order. Sure, McVeigh was fully aware that innocent secretaries and receptionists would be killed as a result of the massive truck bomb he detonated on April 19, 1995. But he was a keen Star Wars fan and he compared those innocents to the \"space-age clerical workers inside the Death Star. Those people weren't storm troopers. But they were vital to the operations of the Evil Empire. And when Luke Skywalker blew up the Death Star, the movie audiences cheered. The bad guys were beaten. That was all that really mattered.\" It is, therefore, churlish of McVeigh to scornfully dismiss - as crazy paranoid nuts - the legions of conspiracy theorists who believe that the truth of the Oklahoma City bombing has yet to be officially recognised. McVeigh is seething about this inside his death row cell. He is due to be executed on May 16. He feels the conspiracy theories are tainting his impending martyrdom. \"You can't handle the truth,\" he has said. \"And the truth is that it is pretty scary that one guy can do this all alone.\" The conspiracy theories centre on a bizarre white separatist encampment on the Oklahoma/Arkansas border called Elohim City and two of its regular visitors: a flamboyant neo-Nazi called Dennis Mahon and an extraordinary German called Andy Strassmeir. McVeigh says the Elohim City conspiracy theories are nonsense, a red herring. But I didn't know what to think. They seemed pretty convincing to me. Perhaps I am becoming a conspiracy nut. Whatever, I wanted to meet the alleged co-conspirators. It would, at least, be interesting to ask them how it felt to be widely considered, by conspiracy theorists, to be the hidden hands behind the Oklahoma City bombing. It was a Monday morning in early April. Dennis Mahon was jumpy and on the run in Arizona. \"It drives you crazy,\" he said. \"Thousands think I was involved. I've started to believe it myself. Maybe I was there. Maybe they brainwashed me and I forgot about it. Maybe I can get hypnotised and remember it. Everybody said I was there. Everybody said I drove the truck. They saw me.\" This is true. In the immediate aftermath of the bombing, many passers-by claimed to have seen McVeigh in Oklahoma City with unknown others. One witness drew a sketch of a John Doe who looked remarkably like how Dennis Mahon might look in dark glasses and a pencil moustache. \"Maybe there's somebody out there who looks like me,\" said Dennis. \"I'm just about ready to turn myself in and tell them, 'Okay motherfuckers, I did it'. But I didn't.\" Then Dennis showed me his scar - the result, he said, of a stress-related intestinal infection. But for all of this Dennis Mahon seemed secretly thrilled to be a central player in the alternative history of the Oklahoma bombing. Columbia Pictures is even considering making a movie of the story I am about to tell. \"It'll be a hell of a good movie,\" he said. \"I hope Tom Berenger plays me. But one guy said Danny DeVito's going to play me. That'll devastate me. I'll leave the country.\" Dennis peered through the curtains of our secret rendezvous location: Room 315 of the Hampton Inn near Phoenix airport. \"The Feds are on my tail!\" he stammered. \"The bastard sons of the FBI followed me here. See that white car?\" \"Why are they following you?\" I asked. \"Well, Tim McVeigh did all his training over there,\" he said, pointing west to Kingman, Arizona. \"And he's going to be executed. And they're afraid there might be retaliation for that. And there very well might be. There very, very, very well might be.\" Dennis Mahon is a veteran neo-Nazi. He was famous before the Oklahoma bombing conspiracy theories. When you see him in old Ku Klux Klan recruitment videos from the 80s , he looks striking and quick-witted. Now he is jowly, the spitting image of the actor John Goodman. \"Yeah, I'm an old guy now,\" says Dennis. \"I'm an old comrade. I've seen changes. More lone wolfism. One man one act. These stupid Klan guys want to be circus clowns. And the Klan's targets are just little negroes. And then they get drunk in a pub and talk about it. You've got to raise your sights a little bit. If you're going to get 10 years for calling somebody a nigger, or throwing a rock through a synagogue window, you might as well go and do a McVeigh. And I think the kids are learning that.\" Dennis Mahon glanced out of the window at the white car. \"I don't believe they can hear us because . . .\" He paused. \"Did you get the room at the last minute?\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Well, I think we're okay,\" he said. Dennis sat on the bed. \"I'd never heard of a Tim McVeigh,\" he said. \"I'd heard of a Tim Tuttle. Tim Tuttle was a real good patriot. Tim Tuttle was a highly decorated army guy from the Gulf War and he was travelling through the area and people wanted me to meet him.\" \"Did you meet Tim Tuttle?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" said Dennis. \"I met Tim Tuttle, but I didn't know he was alias Tim McVeigh. I met him at gun shows. He sold military stuff, knives, gun parts, camouflage uniforms. I remember he had real short hair and real intense eyes and the real long narrow nose like yours.\" Dennis scrutinised, and misinterpreted, my Jewish nose. \"It's a good nose,\" said Dennis. \"Don't get me wrong. Better than mine. Mine's been broke. And we talked about Waco. And I said, 'What comes around goes around. If they keep doing this terrorism on our people, terrorism's going to happen to them.' \" \"That's what you said?\" \"That's what I said to him. He said, 'Probably. Probably so.' \" \"Carol Howe testified that she was at your house when Tim Tuttle telephoned you shortly before the Oklahoma bomb,\" I said. \"Yeah, well,\" said Dennis, sharply. \"That was another Tim. Okay? Another Tim. His name was Tim Buttle.\" We talked about Carol Howe - about the strange love affair at the heart of the conspiracy theories. Carol was a Tulsa society girl and a champion horse rider. She attended private schools and won some local beauty contests. Her father Bob was an oil executive. Her mother Aubyn was a charity hostess. But Carol got in with a druggy crowd and she ended up jumping off a roof and breaking her feet. While she was convalescing from her injuries, she began to idly telephone the local \"Dial-A-Racist\" hotline and listen to the recorded messages: \"The international corporations and Jews and banks control America, and they're out to enslave and destroy the white race.\" She fell in love with the voice as she lay in her sick bed. The voice belonged to Dennis Mahon. She sought him out. \"I met her in a restaurant in Tulsa,\" said Dennis, \"and she comes on crutches. Here's a beautiful young woman who's really in bad shape - you know, physically - hobbling round on crutches trying to fight for her race. And my heart went out to her. She was strikingly beautiful and highly intelligent. Super high IQ. I think she had an IQ of 130. Way up there. She was a lot smarter than I was. She was a very rich girl, a debutante. I saw her house. Six bedrooms. Five car garage. Very wealthy.\" Within minutes of meeting Carol, Dennis had formulated some big plans for her. \"I was going to get her on Oprah. Most of our women are not very intelligent. All they can say is 'nigger this' and 'nigger that'. She could have been our Aryan spokeswoman.\" \"Did you fall in love with her?\" I asked. \"I tried not to, I really did,\" said Dennis. \"I tried to keep it on a professional level. But it was very hard. She was 23 years old. And she had a big swastika tattoo on her arm. I got a bit weak. I did fawn over her. And, yes, I had an intimate relationship with her. I finally said, 'Let's just forget about this whole thing and get married and have children.' \" \"Would you have given up neo-Nazism for her?\" \"Oh yes,\" said Dennis. \"In order to raise a family you have to make pretty good money. But no. She was like a Patty Hearst. She wanted to get into the guns and the explosives.\" So Dennis made Carol some bombs. \"We let them off out in the woods,\" said Dennis. \"And she was . . .\" He broke off. His face flushed red. \"She couldn't make love to me fast enough after that. She loved the bombs.\" \"She testified that you raped her,\" I said, \"and that's why you split up.\" \"Well, she's a lying little snitch,\" said Dennis. \"What really happened was that I finally got so tired. I knew that eventually she was going to make a bomb and hurt herself real bad and I'd be drawn into it. And I would have gone to jail.\" Dennis said it was an amicable split. (Carol testified that he threatened to kill her.) Dennis said he wanted to see her happy. He wanted to introduce her to eligible boys. So he took her to a place called Elohim City. \"It's a white separatist community,\" said Dennis. \"They're fundamentalists, but it's really nice. Lots of good single men out there.\" Elohim City is, for conspiracy theorists, the linchpin of the story. I have been told many times - by conspiracy-minded relatives of bombing victims, by local journalists and Oklahoma City councillors - that Elohim City is a terrorist training camp. It was certainly the hideout of the Aryan Republican Army, who committed a two-year spree of bank robberies using explosives. And it was home, for a year and a half, to a man called Andy Strassmeir. \"He was this tall, tough-looking guy,\" said Dennis. \"A deep German accent. They called him Andy the German. I learned that his visa had run out and he was head of security out at Elohim City. I got to be pretty good friends with him. He told me he was very highly trained. Like our Green Berets. Or your SAS. He really knew his stuff. And he had trained a lot of good people at Elohim City. One time he had almost 30 young men, and women too, drilling them in full soldier drill. And they did just as good as any highly trained army unit in this country.\" \"That makes Elohim City sound like a training camp,\" I said. \"Well,\" he said, \"after Waco they were very fearful they could be next.\" So Dennis took Carol to Elohim City to meet boys. But there was something that he didn't know. After Dennis had threatened to kill Carol, she reported him to the police. Then the local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms - the ATF, the same government agency that raided Waco - approached Carol and asked her to become an undercover informant, and spy for them on Dennis and Elohim City. She agreed. In the months leading up to the Oklahoma bombing, Carol filed a series of reports to the ATF. In one, she reported that Andy Strassmeir had declared, \"It's time to go to war,\" and, \"It's time to start bombing federal buildings.\" In another, she reported that Strassmeir had travelled to Oklahoma City to case the Murrah building as a potential target. In a third, she reported that Elohim City's patriarch, Reverend Robert Millar, preached a Holy War against the Federal Government, and suggested that April 19 might be a good day to start that war. Immediately after the bombing, Carol Howe identified Timothy McVeigh as someone she saw walking through the Elohim City forests with Andy Strassmeir. She also testified that she overheard Dennis Mahon take a telephone call from \"Tim Tuttle\" - the alias McVeigh used. \"Carol had a lot of boyfriends at Elohim City,\" said Dennis. \"But she'd scare them off. You know. 'Hey! Let's make a bomb!' That kind of talk tends to scare guys away.\" Dennis paused. \"Especially when they may actually be planning something.\" \"I'm sorry?\" I said. This was an extraordinary thing for Dennis to say. Dennis remains to this day a close friend of the people at Elohim City. Until now, he has always denied that the community had anything to do with the Oklahoma City bombing. Was he now implying that they may have actually been involved? \"Before that bomb went off in Oklahoma City,\" said Dennis, \"they got rid of her. They told Carol to go back home. They said, 'We need to be by ourselves for a while.'\" \"Who said that to her?\" I asked. \"Her last boyfriend broke up with her and said, 'Maybe you ought to go to Tulsa. Stay away for a while.' She was away from Elohim City for almost two months before the bomb went off. Which is probably a good thing.\" Dennis is a conspiracy theorist, but he said he doesn't believe the conspiracy theory that he was involved in the Oklahoma City bombing. \"I think Andy Strassmeir was,\" he said. \"Or at least he knew about it. I've been trying to contact him for years. I've always defended him. And now he won't return my phone calls. And I've been banned from Germany. Why is that? So I'm taking all the heat and he's run off to Germany.\" Dennis said that if Andy Strassmeir wasn't involved, perhaps a crack team of Iraqi Republican Guards were, acting under the orders of Saddam Hussein. \"There's quite a few Iraqis in Oklahoma,\" he said. \"Those guys are highly trained in improvised munitions and explosives. Whereas Tim was not. Certainly one of them could have trained Tim. There are 600 Iraqi Republican Guards in the Oklahoma City area.\" The conspiracy theories were getting crazier. I wanted to get back to the facts. And this is a fact: on the morning of April 19, 1995 - just as Timothy McVeigh's yellow Ryder truck packed with three 55-gallon drums of liquid nitromethane pulled up outside the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City - a death row prisoner in Arkansas called Richard Wayne Snell asked his guard if he could watch the TV news. The guard agreed. Snell was to be executed within hours. Getting to watch CNN was just about his final request. Snell had murdered a black state trooper called Louis Bryant and a pawn shop owner called William Stumpp, whom Snell had mistakenly believed to be Jewish. Snell had also plotted, in 1983, to blow up the Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. He only abandoned the plan when the rocket-launcher he'd been practising with exploded in his hands. He took this as a sign that God didn't want him to go ahead with the plan. Snell's co-conspirator in the 1983 plot was a neo-Nazi called James Ellison, who lived at Elohim City and was, in fact, married to Reverend Millar's granddaughter. Within the more hard-core factions of the American militia movement, Snell was a hero and a martyr: a respected preacher and political prisoner. His supporters were outraged that the Arkansas governor had chosen April 19 for the execution date. They considered it a deliberate kick in the teeth. April 19 is holy day for anti-government activists and conspiracy theorists. On April 19, 1993, Federal agents ended the siege at Waco. David Koresh's Branch Davidian church went up in flames. On April 19, 1775, 400 British government troops attempted to disarm the citizens of Lexington, Massachusetts. A hundred colonists shot back, the first shots of the American Revolution, the \"shots heard around the world\". (When I visit American militias and patriots and neo-Nazis, they often ask me what I, a Brit, thinks of the Lexington uprising. I explain that I'm not au fait with the ins and outs. They are scandalised that our syllabus doesn't teach this pivotal moment in British history.) So executing Snell on April 19 was perceived to be an insult levelled at the American militia movement. The guard on death watch duty agreed to Snell's request. He turned on CNN, just as news was breaking of the bombing of the Murrah building. Snell had already warned his prison guards that his death would be avenged. And now, the penitentiary's death watch log noted, Richard Wayne Snell watched the breaking news and he \"smiled and chuckled and nodded\". Shortly afterwards, he was executed by lethal injection. His good friend and spiritual advisor, the Reverend Robert Millar, transported his body to its final resting place: Elohim City. After all I'd heard about Elohim City, I felt a little intimidated as I drove up into the Ozark mountains towards the community. I turned left at the covered bridge, the very spot where Timothy McVeigh had received a speeding ticket on October 12, 1993. McVeigh has always denied visiting Elohim City, but I couldn't imagine where else he could have been heading, out here in the middle of the dusty nothingness. In fact, only one official record links McVeigh to Elohim City: a telephone call he made on April 5, 1995, a fortnight before the bombing. He had bought a telephone calling card from the back pages of the Spotlight, the right-wing newspaper dedicated to seeking out and exposing the Bilderberg Group, the internationalist think tank believed by conspiracy theorists, McVeigh included, to be the shadowy elite that secretly rules the world. McVeigh used the phone card to make enquiries about where he might order a Ryder truck. Then he phoned Elohim City and asked to speak to \"Andy\". But Andy Strassmeir wasn't there. So McVeigh put the phone down again. My instructions were to pull up at Elohim City's entrance, stay in the car, and honk my horn until somebody came to fetch me. I did this. I honked and honked, intrusively breaking the silence. I wondered why I had to sit there and honk. Were people doing things that they didn't want a journalist to know about? Had they been told to stop doing whatever it was when the honking journalist arrived? So I felt intimidated as I sat there honking. And then the children of Elohim City suddenly appeared from nowhere and performed, for my benefit, an impressive and well rehearsed rendition of Riverdance. I clapped when it was over. Then Elohim City's resident chiropractor, Dr Buzz, offered me a cranial massage. \"No thanks,\" I said. Elohim City looked like something out of the Brothers Grimm. Brightly coloured elf type houses scattered the forest. The whole place would have resembled some new-age retreat, something like the Findhorn Foundation, if it wasn't for the fact that everyone was carrying semi-automatic rifles. Then I was invited into the meeting hall to sit in on a travelling soap salesman's presentation. He wanted to sell Elohim City soap powder and water-refining tablets. The women of the community and Reverend Millar, who looks like Santa Claus, fired questions at the salesman. \"We don't want chlorine,\" said Reverend Millar. \"Chlorine causes cancer.\" \"This isn't a game,\" said the salesman. \"This is serious. Cleanliness is serious.\" \"Health is important,\" said Reverend Millar. Reverend Millar is a conspiracy theorist, but he doesn't believe the conspiracy theory that he and his community were behind the Oklahoma City bombing. He thinks the bomb was planted by the government itself, a New World Order plot to turn the world against survivalists and implement gun-control legislation, much like Hitler's burning of the Reichstag. \"I think,\" he told me, \"it was an operation by the Zionists who have infiltrated our government agencies to disparage people like us. To give us a black eye.\" Carol Howe, he added, was \"a poor little rich girl. We fed her and housed her. I didn't know that $400 of my tax money was going to her with each visit. She was here several times. And then she went back and told things that were so far from the truth. She said we had prepared a bomb or discussed that sort of thing. Something very violent. And, as you can see, that's hardly typical of us here.\" \"Could you show me your cemetery?\" I asked. \"Sure,\" he said. He took me down to a field at the bottom of a hill. \"How many people are buried here?\" I asked him. \"All the dead ones,\" he said. \"Ha ha! I'm sorry. Half-a-dozen.\" We looked at the headstones. \"This is my beloved wife,\" said Reverend Millar. \"We had been married 55 years and nine months. She was my sweetheart from college days. And here's Richard Wayne Snell. I guess this is the one you're interested in.\" Snell's headstone read, \"Rev Richard Wayne Snell. Patriot. May 21st 1930 - April 19th 1995\". \"It was a lethal injection,\" said Reverend Millar. \"I was there. He said, 'I am ready to go.' He died in full confidence of his hereafter. The idea that he was all excited about a bombing in Oklahoma City never passed between us.\" \"Why is he buried at Elohim City?\" I asked. \"He requested it,\" said Reverend Millar, a little sharply. \"He asked me to be his spiritual adviser. I visited him regularly in the years between the trial and the execution.\" \"April 19,\" I said. \"Very significant,\" he said. \"I had talked to the lieutenant governor of Arkansas and I suggested that it was a poor day to choose. I thought it would contribute to civic unrest.\" He paused, and softly added, \"The government can be more interested in demonstrating their control than they are in the interests of the nation that they represent.\" As we walked away from the cemetery, Reverend Millar happened to notice the Kansas licence plate of my hire car. \"Ah,\" laughed Reverend Millar. \"Just like the Ryder truck! You rented this in Kansas!\" There was a silence. \"I'm sorry?\" I said. Reverend Millar is a man who claims to know nothing about the Oklahoma City bombing, who says he needs to be reminded even of what date the explosion occurred. And now he was bringing up the most esoteric fact about McVeigh's plot - that the Ryder truck used for the bombing had been rented in Kansas. Was this a little playful clue, on his part, that there was more to Elohim City than meets the eye? Reverend Millar giggled. \"Just kidding,\" he said. There is a tiny strip club in Tulsa called Lady Godiva. It was once a salad bar, but the salads didn't take off so Floyd Ratcliffe bought the place up, painted it black, advertised for topless dancers, and now between 75 and 150 men attend each night. I sat in the back office with Floyd and his former wife Julie. \"My official title,\" said Julie to my notepad, \"is vice-president of Lady Godiva.\" She laughed. Then she stopped laughing and said, \"I'm not bullshitting you. Really.\" Behind us, a CCTV monitor screen flashed between the big bouncer doing neck exercises at the door, the bar, the stage, and the dressing room where the strippers went to change and apply make-up. A second CCTV monitor focused just on the dressing room. \"Do the women know they're being taped naked backstage?\" I asked Floyd. \"Why do you tape them?\" \"A lot of the girls,\" explained Floyd, \"are good girls. But it keeps down thievery. It keeps down drugs.\" On the night of April 8, 1995, two strippers from Arkansas got into a fight in Lady Godiva's dressing room - a fight that was taped by Floyd's CCTV camera. \"As it turns out,\" explained Floyd, \"one of the girls was nervous and had taken some pills before she got here, which made her hyper and made her clash with everybody.\" \"We usually erase the tapes after two weeks,\" added Julie. \"The reason why we kept this particular tape is because the cat fight was really quite humorous. So we kept it for entertainment.\" Some weeks after the cat fight occurred, the two warring strippers applied for jobs at an erotic bar in Arkansas. Their prospective employer had heard of the taped cat fight and so he asked Floyd to send him the cassette. \"He was trying to figure out whose fault the cat fight was,\" explained Floyd. \"Was it one of the girls' fault? Was it Lady Godiva's fault?\" So Floyd sent the tape to the club owner in Arkansas. \"So,\" said Floyd, \"he's looking at the tape to try and find out what went wrong, and I think, being a little bit nosy, he wanted to see the rest of the tape. And as he's watching the rest of the tape, he suddenly realises that he's seeing something quite extraordinary.\" This was true. There is a moment on the CCTV tape dated April 8, 1995, that could be seen to be incredible. Here is a transcript of that moment: Stripper 1 (leaning into the mirror, adjusting her costume): \"You know those three guys I'm sitting out there with? Well one of them says he's looking for a girl to fool around with tonight. Are you interested?\" Stripper 2: \"Well, okay, I'll figure out a way to scam them.\" The conversation becomes unintelligible for a while. The strippers talk about the three guys out front. Stripper 1: (unintelligible) \"... and one of them said, 'I'm a very smart man.' 'You are?' 'Yes, I am. And on April 19, 1995, you'll remember me for the rest of your life!' 'Oh really?' 'Yes, you will.' \" Stripper 1 laughs and starts to walk out of the dressing room. Then she turns back to the other and says, \"Weirdo!\" \"They were odd comments,\" said Julie. \"It just seemed odd. The girls thought, maybe they're going to come out with some big invention on April 19.\" \"But unfortunately,\" said Floyd, \"it turned out to be such a devastating event that they were in fact talking about.\" When the club owner in Arkansas realised the significance of the tape, he sent it back to Floyd and Julie. They telephoned the FBI. \"Several days later,\" said Floyd, \"a couple of agents came to the club, confiscated the tape, talked to the girls involved, and showed them pictures. The girls did identify three guys.\" \"McVeigh,\" said Julie. \"They identified McVeigh and Nichols and the other gentlemen. Um. Sloshmayer...\" \"Strassmeir?\" I asked. \"Strassmeir,\" said Julie. \"Right. Excuse me. They all did identify that gentleman.\" \"And of course,\" I said, \"everyone's heard of McVeigh and Nichols. But not of Strassmeir.\" \"True,\" said Julie. \"But the girls did identify Strassmeir in the line-ups.\" \"It seems like the more we find out,\" said Floyd, \"the less we want to know. I don't know if it's a cover up. I don't know if they're trying to protect Strassmeir. There are just a lot of things I don't know. There are a lot of things that we will never know.\" There was a silence. \"It's a bad deal,\" said Floyd. Julie nodded. \"It's a bad deal all around. They were here. It's nothing to be proud of. If not here, someplace else.\" \"They wanted to see girls,\" I said. \"Sure,\" said Floyd. \"Sure. It's a semi-nude sexual-oriented type business, so we're quite popular in this part of the country.\" \"What did the FBI agents say?\" I asked. \"At the time, they said, 'We'll put it on the back burner and let it sit.' \" Floyd paused. \"Well, that's where it's been. This is five years later. And it's still on the back burner.\" Something else was noticed at Lady Godiva on the night of April 8. After one of the cat-fight strippers had been thrown out of the club by Floyd, she needed to urinate. Floyd wouldn't let her back in, so she urinated in the car park. She urinated right next to a yellow Ryder truck. In the immediate aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton promised that no stone would be left unturned. Two thousand Federal agents were assigned to the case, 20,000 individuals were interviewed. But the people at Elohim City were never questioned. Andy Strassmeir was never questioned. Surely they could at least have questioned him. It turns out that Andy Strassmeir's father is Gunther Strassmeir, Helmut Kohl's Secretary of State, a man known as the \"architect of German reunification\". Andy Strassmeir received military intelligence training at the Bundeswehr Academy in Hanover. In the light of this new knowledge, Reverend Millar now believes that Carol Howe was not the only undercover federal informant working at Elohim City. \"Strassmeir,\" he said, \"didn't contribute to community harmony. We had a little lady here. She was 80 years old. She'd feed him. She liked Andy. She cared for him. But when she wanted some painting done, he wanted to get paid by the hour. He acted like he was without financial resources. But whenever he went to buy something, he had the credit cards to buy the best.\" Reverend Millar paused. \"We do know,\" he added, \"that Andy contacted an anti-terrorist agency here in the United States when he first landed.\" Andy Strassmeir is now back in Germany, living with his parents. In the light of Carol Howe's undercover reports to the ATF, the American government considered launching a raid on Elohim City in the months before the Oklahoma City bombing. But they abandoned the plan. I asked FBI special agent Bob Ricks why they changed their minds. (Incidentally, Ricks was one of the special agents in charge of the siege at Waco. McVeigh had originally considered killing Ricks - or a Waco and Ruby Ridge sniper called Lon Horiuchi - instead of blowing up the Murrah building. But he decided that the Murrah would make more of an impact.) \"Why did we abandon the raid on Elohim City?\" said Ricks. \"We didn't want another Waco.\" There is a terrible irony to that decision. The American government's paranoid fear, and the reason why they originally raided Waco, was that they believed David Koresh might launch a terrorist attack on mainstream America. If you believe the Oklahoma conspiracy theories - if you believe that this story is more than just a series of coincidences - you are left with a startling conclusion. Had the raid on Elohim City not been abandoned, the Oklahoma City bombing might never have happened. The conspiracy theories inevitably reach a chilling conclusion: something that the theorists are disinclined to state publicly, fearful that the general public might consider them paranoid lunatics. They ask themselves why every member of the ATF based at the Murrah building survived the bombing. The ATF office was one of McVeigh's chief targets. Most of the Bureau's employees didn't turn up for work that morning. The conspiracy theorists put two and two together. Perhaps Strassmeir had tipped them off about the bombing in advance, and they incompetently failed to stop it happening. Perhaps they planned a sting operation, but it somehow went awry. Perhaps they have been covering this fact up ever since. Timothy McVeigh says he was 1,000 miles away from Lady Godiva on April 8. He says he was at the Imperial Motel in Kingman, Arizona. He says the conspiracy theorists are crazy, and he only ever met Andy Strassmeir once, at a gun show. He says he never visited Elohim City. He admits he telephoned the community on April 5, and asked to speak to Andy, but only because he thought that Elohim City might have been a suitable hideout for him after the bombing. One wonders why, if this story is true, McVeigh is protecting Strassmeir - an undercover informant. Does he fear reprisals against his family if he spills the beans? Is he embarrassed that he was suckered by a federal employee? Does he want to be considered a lone wolf, a martyr? McVeigh's aim, in blowing up the Murrah building, was to strike at the heart of the New World Order. And now conspiracy theorists are beginning to believe that the New World Order itself might have played a role in the conspiracy. McVeigh is seething about this in his death row cell. He will consequently be executed, on May 16, an unsatisfied man.",

      "body": "<p>In Christopher Buckley's satire The White House Mess, the president's staff want to keep the ambitious vice-president out of the way so they send him to Muscat, the capital of Oman, for a \"cross-cultural conference\". </p> <p>It's still that sort of place. Half a century after the explorer Wilfred Thesiger first saw Oman, it still remains relatively and resolutely undiscovered. And Thesiger could hardly be accused of failing to plug it in his book Arabian Sands. Despite the fact that he chose to travel 1,000km by camel through the unforgiving desert of Rub-al-Khali, the Empty Quarter, Thesiger reckoned his five years with the Bedouin tribes in Oman were \"the most important of his life\". </p> <p>It's pretty splendid still for, as well as sometimes magnificent desert, it's the land of frankincense, has terrific forts and ports, and wadis - oases of green and rock and water that spring on you unexpectedly. So, it doesn't need to be this obscure, but to a large degree it likes it that way. </p> <p>Greater Muscat, the capital area, is three small towns strung along 35 miles of coast: there's Muscat itself, where Sultan Qaboos's palace, Al Alam, is, but not much else; Ruwi, with a lot of the hotels and almost all of the commerce; and Muttrah, with most of the tourist-pleasing bits. Government offices and new residential areas sprawl in between and alongside. </p> <p>Ruwi, where we stayed the first night, is ugly, and we quickly escaped in a cab to Muttrah, strolled along the cornice at dusk and popped into the souq, where a mixture of frankincense-sellers and general shops, clothes stores and silver and gold merchants encourage but don't really hassle. When we went back there later in the week, there were more tourists around, and we haggled successfully, but business is conducted in an altogether lower key than, say, the market in Marrakesh. </p> <p>There are cruise holidays that pop into Muttrah, hit the souq, and get back on the boat. There are round-the-world jet tours that stay in Oman for a couple of nights but don't do much more than the souq and a stay at one of the big hotels across the city. Christopher Buckley's vice-president would have no doubt stayed at the Al-Bustani, a vast and eye-water ingly pricey hotel with a vast atrium and a floor reserved exclusively for the royal family. I preferred the look of the other premier-league hotel, the Hyatt Regency. </p> <p>Sunbathing can be reliably planned: it had rained in Muscat in January and December, short showers, and these were the the first for three years. But the best of Oman seemed to be to be outside Muscat. To get around the country, you need to drive a lot. In Muscat, the dual carriageways are new and cared for, with flowerbeds by the side. But in 1970, when the Sultan took over, Oman only had six miles of road. To get far beyond Muscat, you need a four-wheel drive. And you really need a guide. That's why the holiday trade for Oman is still at the carefully-organised stage. </p> <p>We went at a fair pace, 1,300 miles in four days, of which I'd reckon a good 40% was on bumpy, barely-planned roads where knowing the turn-off seemed to depend as much on feel and instinct as anything else. On these tracks there is barely any signposting and precious few other vehicles. But, especially to the south and east of Muscat, the rewards are great. The best souq experience was in Nizwa, partly because we headed there on a Friday, the best day to be there, for the goat and cattle market. It happens every week but the bustle and noise was thrilling. </p> <p>Near Nizwa is Jabrin fort, a 17th-century castle, the first and most famous of several castles we visited. And then, into the mountains, towards the peak of Jebel Shams, and on to Oman's Grand Canyon, Jebel Akhdar. The rock is greyer and its area is much smaller, but it was not the only time in this week, with the contrasts of spectacular hills, desert and Vegas-style hotels, that I was reminded of the south-west of America. </p> <p>Sometimes I bored of the sand and scrub. But on our travels - kind of Thesiger-Lite - there was a moment, an afternoon, that just took my breath away: stunning, authentic, a world away from home. Tony, our guide, drove off us off road, into the foothills of Wahiba Sands, an expanse of golden dunes. He knew a Bedouin family who had settled there, and decided we would go for lunch. Up and across - heaven knows how - we landed at their farm in the sand, where the women brought us plates, waited for us for us to finish, and then ate. That famous and true Bedouin hospitality. They lived and slept in rectangular, wooden tents, and kept goats that stayed in the shade under carts and vehicles. </p> <p>We bashed along the coast to Ras al Jinz, at the north-eastern tip of the country, for a night-time appointment on the turtle beach. Again showing a method in their caution about tourism, the government restricts access to the beach at night-time. A guide asks you to wait and with luck finds a turtle that has made its way on to land to lay its eggs. We got the turtles, but not the eggs. It didn't matter to me. One of the guides was reacquainted with a turtle he'd marked before - proof that they return again and again to the same place. </p> <p>The next day, we stopped at Wadi Shab, the best wadi we saw. In a beautiful valley, water teemed through the stone, feeding a lake and some spectacular date palms. There was a stupendous walk to be done there. Another time. The coastal town of Sur was pleasant, and the beaches around here looked terrific, too, especially at Tiwi, about the only place, outside Muscat, we saw a large party of holidaymakers. </p> <p> Muscat is popular with Germans, but the tourist trade is emerging only slowly, encouraged by Sultan Qaboos. Getting a visa is still a hassle, the infrastructure is developing slowly, and the country is reluctant to turn its back on its traditional Arab life. It could be the new Dubai, golf courses and glitz, but it won't go that way quickly, if at all. There is a bit of oil, but not much. </p> <p>About a quarter of the population of Oman is foreign nationals, high but nothing to compare with the 80% of so in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Oman men working for the government are required by law to wear traditional dishdashas , and many women wear abayahs . You can sink a cold beer in Muscat's business-class hotels, but you could pay \u00a34 for it and alcohol is available in few hotels outside the capital and very few restaurants anywhere. The exchange rate works out at roughly \u00a32 to one rial and Oman doesn't feel cheap. The food is fine, but not stunning, and you have to be prepared for plenty of Indian meals. </p> <p>We had a day travelling west of Muscat, to forts at Rustaq, Al Hazm and Nakhl, and then hopped on an Oman Air plane to Salalah, in the very south-east corner of the country. It feels different, one remove from the more bustly atmosphere of the north. The land is much lusher and they do have a monsoon season, between June and September. The city itself is unprepossessing. Thesiger started off from here. </p> <p>What it does have is the centre of Oman's frankincense trade, the trade that made it famous. A white, gloopy resin is taken from the trees dotted around Dhofar region in March and May, stored away from the damp monsoon mists, and sent to market in September. Legend has it that the three kings met up here on their way to Bethlehem. </p> <p>The Haffa souk has good deals on the best local frankincense, called Hujari, and we stocked up on presents. I paid four rials for jars of frankincense, myrrh and sandalwood, and some charcoal and a pot to heat it on. </p> <p>We travelled out of Salalah, one way to the archaeological site of the Queen of Sheba's palace and to good coastline around Mirbat, and the other way up in the mountains to Mughsail beach and to the tomb of the Prophet Job.

      "body": "<p>The voices of nine men and 18 women harmonise in the time-worn prayers of Evensong as the light drains out of the gold and orange tracery of the great Jesse window above the choir: \"Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord, and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night.\" </p> <p>It brings a shiver to the spine of the sturdiest unbeliever and calls up a time when wolves inhabited the darkness and winter nights seemed infinitely long - the time when our ancestors, in a burst of creativity, devotion and toil which lasted some 200 years, built the glorious medieval cathedrals of England and Europe. </p> <p>This one at Wells is among the best of them. It was the first cathedral built entirely in the Early English style, which began around 1175, and is widely thought to have the finest west front in the country. Like a huge altar screen built in stone, it is encrusted with more than 350 carved statues which tell the Christian story of the world with Christ in Glory on the central pinnacle. </p> <p>It was a unique inspiration, the first outdoor display of its kind in the Christian world, predating similar facades in the rest of Europe by 50 years. The architectural his torian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, in his book Buildings of England, said that Wells \"represents the most original treatment of space in architecture of which any country at that time was capable\". </p> <p>The Dean of Wells, the very Rev Richard Lewis, shares Pevsner's enthusiasm. \"It has a simplicity of line, and the proportions are right,\" he says. \"It's built on the pattern of the double cube which the Greek philosophers thought was in harmony with man's perfection. It's huge, but it's not so overpowering that it takes away your humanity. </p> <p>Wells first became the seat of a bishop in the 10th century, and in the 14th century it was Somerset's largest wool town. But the industry was lured away by water power and coal, and little has happened since except the modern arrival of an electronics factory and a firm that makes most of the country's supermarket trolleys. </p> <p>Christopher Booker, the Sunday Telegraph columnist and co-founder of Private Eye, has lived near Wells for 16 years. He says that when he introduces friends to the city they spend a day looking at the cathedral and wandering round the old centre, and then head for nearby attractions like the Cheddar Gorge and Glastonbury. </p> <p>\"The cathedral dominates the town in the way a good cathedral should,\" he says. \"I love wandering round the cobbled square when the market's there on Saturdays - there's a very good fish stall. And the cathedral has a perfect close, with some very fine architecture in the street next to it called the Liberty.\" </p> <p>The Dean puts it more bluntly: \"There is no reason to come to Wells other than the cathedral, and if the cathedral wasn't here it would be just another struggling Somerset town. The cathedral and the cathedral school add vibrancy to Wells and their contribution to the local economy is enormous: the school employs about 250 people and we employ about 100.\" </p> <p>The consequence is that there is no urban sprawl and no modern intrusion on the ancient buildings of England's smallest city, granted its first charter by King John in 1201.

      "bodyText": "The voices of nine men and 18 women harmonise in the time-worn prayers of Evensong as the light drains out of the gold and orange tracery of the great Jesse window above the choir: \"Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord, and by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night.\" It brings a shiver to the spine of the sturdiest unbeliever and calls up a time when wolves inhabited the darkness and winter nights seemed infinitely long - the time when our ancestors, in a burst of creativity, devotion and toil which lasted some 200 years, built the glorious medieval cathedrals of England and Europe. This one at Wells is among the best of them. It was the first cathedral built entirely in the Early English style, which began around 1175, and is widely thought to have the finest west front in the country. Like a huge altar screen built in stone, it is encrusted with more than 350 carved statues which tell the Christian story of the world with Christ in Glory on the central pinnacle. It was a unique inspiration, the first outdoor display of its kind in the Christian world, predating similar facades in the rest of Europe by 50 years. The architectural his torian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, in his book Buildings of England, said that Wells \"represents the most original treatment of space in architecture of which any country at that time was capable\". The Dean of Wells, the very Rev Richard Lewis, shares Pevsner's enthusiasm. \"It has a simplicity of line, and the proportions are right,\" he says. \"It's built on the pattern of the double cube which the Greek philosophers thought was in harmony with man's perfection. It's huge, but it's not so overpowering that it takes away your humanity. Wells first became the seat of a bishop in the 10th century, and in the 14th century it was Somerset's largest wool town. But the industry was lured away by water power and coal, and little has happened since except the modern arrival of an electronics factory and a firm that makes most of the country's supermarket trolleys. Christopher Booker, the Sunday Telegraph columnist and co-founder of Private Eye, has lived near Wells for 16 years. He says that when he introduces friends to the city they spend a day looking at the cathedral and wandering round the old centre, and then head for nearby attractions like the Cheddar Gorge and Glastonbury. \"The cathedral dominates the town in the way a good cathedral should,\" he says. \"I love wandering round the cobbled square when the market's there on Saturdays - there's a very good fish stall. And the cathedral has a perfect close, with some very fine architecture in the street next to it called the Liberty.\" The Dean puts it more bluntly: \"There is no reason to come to Wells other than the cathedral, and if the cathedral wasn't here it would be just another struggling Somerset town. The cathedral and the cathedral school add vibrancy to Wells and their contribution to the local economy is enormous: the school employs about 250 people and we employ about 100.\" The consequence is that there is no urban sprawl and no modern intrusion on the ancient buildings of England's smallest city, granted its first charter by King John in 1201. You can see the best of Wells in a day - two if you really want to get under the skin of the cathedral. It's small-scale, well-preserved and pleasantly provincial. Next door to the cathedral is the Bishop's Palace, fortified and moated from the time when he was considered an enemy by the local people, now occupied by the Very Rev Jim Thompson, star of Thought for the Day. When the swans on the moat are hungry, they pull a cord by the gatehouse which rings a bell - something I wouldn't have believed without seeing it. In the bishop's ground, you can also stick your head through a hole in a wall to look at the eponymous wells, which pump out 40 gallons of water a second: some of it still runs in deep gutters down the market place, where it was first directed to swill away the refuse from butchers' stalls. On the opposite side of the cathedral is Vicar's Close, built originally for the Vicar's Choral (the choristers), perhaps to keep them from the temptations of the town. It is claimed to be the oldest continually-inhabited medieval street in Europe: some of the houses are now practice rooms for Wells Cathedral School, and on warm evenings visitors perch on the walls to listen. The pupils also put on free lunchtime concerts. You might bump into the choristers as they walk over to the cathedral in their blue-and-white surplices. Then there are Harper's and Bubwith's almshouses in Chamberlain Street, and if you're still feeling ecclesiastical there's St Cuthbert's parish church, which has a lovely painted ceiling and an even more impressive door than the cathedral. At the top of the High Street, you come to Penniless Porch, the gateway between the Market Place and the Cathedral Close: it was built for beggars in 1456 by Bishop Bekynton, whose chapel in the cathedral contains one effigy of him in full regalia, and a second of him as an emaciated cadaver.

He composed a number of vocal and choral pieces, including settings of Emily Dickinson, the Book of Isaiah and Walt Whitman, three ballets for the celebrated choreographer, Martha Graham - Samson Agonistes (1961), Phaedra (1962) and The Lady Of The House of Sleep (1978) - plus The Dybbuk, first staged in Berlin in 1960.</p> <p>Starer was also active as an opera composer; his first venture, The Intruder, having been premiered in New York in 1956. It was succeeded by Pantagleize (1973), for which he fashioned his own libretto from Michel de Ghelderode's play, and several to texts provided by his partner, the nov elist Gail Godwin, including The Last Lover (1975) and Apollonia (1979).</p> <p>Most recently, there was The Other Voice - a chamber opera based on Hilda, the 7th-century abbess and founder of Whitby Abbey - which requires minimal staging, not unlike Britten's church parables.

This period may account for the Arab and Jewish influences on his music, especially with regard to its chromaticism and liberal use of dissonance.</p> <p>On emigrating again, this time to the United States, Starer studied at the Juilliard School of Music, then with Aaron Copland at the Tanglewood Institute, in 1948.

      "bodyText": "Researchers in the US have created children with a genetic modification which could be passed on to future generations - so-called germline engineering, illegal in Britain. The nearly 30 children, born as a result of IVF treatment for infertile women, effectively have three parents. They are said to be healthy. The technique is less startling than might at first appear since it does not involve genetically modifying any of the estimated 30,000 genes in the nucleus of the children's cells, the DNA collectively referred to as the human genome. Researchers were focusing on another, much smaller set of 27 genes in a component of the cell called the mitochondrion, which produces a chemical called ATP, essential to life. In normal human reproduction, the human embryo is created when a man's sperm carries its 23 gene-bearing chromosomes into a woman's egg, where it combines with her 23 chromosomes to make up the full set of genes. The mitochondria are in another part of the egg, and are passed down, complete, from a mother to her children. In the infertile women being treated in the US, scientists believed defects in their eggs could best be treated by adding part of a donor egg. This had the side-effect of introducing the donor's mitochondria into the cells of the embryo. In effect, the children have two mothers and one father, although the vast bulk of their genes come from their \"natural\" parents. The research, at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at St Barnabas in New Jersey, shows how the desire of infertile men and women to have children is stretching the boundaries of the science and ethics of human life. The children have two sets of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in every cell of their bodies. It is not clear whether this will affect their health, or what mitochondria they will pass on to their offspring. The main US genetics research watchdog did not step in to decide whether the research should proceed because nucleic DNA was not involved. This decision was criticised by the journal Science, which warned that it was wrong to assume mtDNA did not affect the wider workings of the human mind and body. The birth of Emma, the first child to be born through this technique, was reported in the medical press in 1997, but few realised the significance. In March the St Barnabas researchers reported in the journal Human Reproduction that they had checked the mtDNA in the blood of two of the nearly 30 children born worldwide using the technique. They found that the children, both aged one, did indeed have mtDNA from two \"mothers\". \"This report is the first case of human germline genetic modification resulting in normal healthy children,\" they wrote.",

(By contrast, contemporary video art demands an attention span that is heroically long.)

The musicians of the second temple numbered four thousand, and they played a variety of stringed, wind and percussive instruments, to accompany dancers as well as singers.</p> <p>The Psalms are therefore a single masterpiece written by many masters; as such they refute the post-Romantic notion that artists must be great individualists and conscious above all of self. As might be expected of hymns in cultic use, they were continually and perhaps unconsciously modified (as Denis Alcapone can be heard to do in performance); even as printed texts they are spectacularly unstable, whether in Hebrew or Greek or Latin, or in Lutheran, Calvinistic or Authorized versions, and any of the thousands of translations, paraphrases, metaphrases and adaptations made by hundreds of poets, the best and the worst.</p> <p> The most charismatic text in English remains the Authorized Version, which is the one preferred by fundamentalists everywhere; even when new prophets choose to rewrite the Psalms, as Joseph Smith did for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the 1820s, the version they tinker with is the Authorized Version.

      "body": "<p><strong> Selkirk's Island</strong> <br> Diana Souhami <br> 256pp, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> This book is a retelling of Robinson Crusoe in which the real hero is the island; a parable of nature surviving the colonising ambitions of man. It is based on the true story of Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on the island of Juan Fernandez in the South Seas. Selkirk had been sailing master of the galley Cinque-Ports , a companion to the St George , commanded by Captain William Dampier, which left England on a privateering expedition in 1703. In September 1704, after a violent quarrel with his captain Thomas Stradling, Selkirk was put ashore on Juan Fernandez, where he lived in solitude for four years until picked up by another Dampier expedition, this time commanded by Woodes Rogers and Edward Cooke, in 1709. The story of these voyages - culled from contemporary accounts by Cooke, Rogers, Dampier and Selkirk himself - forms the core of Selkirk's Island , but it is framed by the environmental history of Juan Fernandez. </p> <p>Souhami begins with a lyrical introduction describing the natural beauties of the island; it is a paradisal episode, a moment out of time. With the arrival of the first explorers, however, the book enters the dirty realm of history.

      "bodyText": "Selkirk's Island Diana Souhami 256pp, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, \u00a314.99 This book is a retelling of Robinson Crusoe in which the real hero is the island; a parable of nature surviving the colonising ambitions of man. It is based on the true story of Alexander Selkirk, who was marooned on the island of Juan Fernandez in the South Seas. Selkirk had been sailing master of the galley Cinque-Ports , a companion to the St George , commanded by Captain William Dampier, which left England on a privateering expedition in 1703. In September 1704, after a violent quarrel with his captain Thomas Stradling, Selkirk was put ashore on Juan Fernandez, where he lived in solitude for four years until picked up by another Dampier expedition, this time commanded by Woodes Rogers and Edward Cooke, in 1709. The story of these voyages - culled from contemporary accounts by Cooke, Rogers, Dampier and Selkirk himself - forms the core of Selkirk's Island , but it is framed by the environmental history of Juan Fernandez. Souhami begins with a lyrical introduction describing the natural beauties of the island; it is a paradisal episode, a moment out of time. With the arrival of the first explorers, however, the book enters the dirty realm of history. There is no romance: it is a tale of greed and casual cruelty from the start, a battle of each against all. To some degree this must be right: Darwinian logic says that the privateers of the early 18th century must have been a selfish and unscrupulous lot; and the general testimony of history would probably concur.

      "body": "<p>Why should we still read George Orwell on politics? Until 1989, the answer was plain. He was the writer who captured the essence of totalitarianism. All over communist-ruled Europe, people would show me their dog-eared, samizdat copies of Animal Farm or Nineteen Eighty-Four and ask: \"How did he know?\" </p> <p>Yet the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four ended in 1989. Orwellian regimes persisted in a few remote countries, such as North Korea, and communism survived in an attenuated form in China. But the three dragons against which Orwell fought his good fight - European and especially British imperialism; fascism, whether Italian, German or Spanish; and communism, not to be confused with the democratic socialism in which Orwell himself believed - were all either dead or mortally weakened. Forty years after his own painful and early death, Orwell had won. </p> <p>What need, then, of Orwell? One answer is that we should read him because of his historical impact. For Orwell was the most influential political writer of the 20th century. This is a bold claim, but who else would compete? Among novelists, perhaps Alexander Solzhenitsyn or Albert Camus; among playwrights, Bertolt Brecht. Or would it be a philosopher, such as Karl Popper, Friedrich von Hayek,or Hannah Arendt? Or the novelist, playwright and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whom Orwell privately called \"a bag of wind\"? Take them one by one, and you will find that each made an impact more limited in duration or geographical scope than did this short-lived, old-fashioned English man of letters. </p> <p>Worldwide familiarity with the word \"Orwellian\" is proof of that influence. \"Orwellian\" is used as a pejorative adjective, to evoke totalitarian terror, the falsification of history by state-organised lying and, more loosely, any unpleasant example of repression or manipulation. It is used as a noun, to describe an admirer and conscious follower of his work. Occasionally, it is deployed as a complimentary adjective, to mean something like \"displaying outspoken intellectual honesty, like Orwell\". Very few other writers have garnered this double tribute of becoming both adjective and noun. </p> <p>Everywhere that people lived under totalitarian dictatorships, they felt he was one of them. The Russian poet Natalya Gorbanyevskaya once told me that Orwell was an east European. In fact, he was a very English writer who never went anywhere near eastern Europe. His knowledge of the communist world was largely derived from reading. </p> <p>Three personal experiences had transformed his understanding. First, as a British imperial policeman for five years in Burma he was himself the servant of an oppressive, though not a totalitarian regime. By the time he resigned, he had acquired a lifelong hatred of imperialism and also a deep insight into the psychology of the oppressor. Then he went to live among the \"down-and-outs\" in England and in Paris. So he knew at first hand the humiliating unfreedom that comes from poverty. </p> <p>Finally, there was the Spanish civil war. Spain, for Orwell, meant the experience of fighting fascism and getting a bullet through his throat. But still more important was the revelation of Russian-led communist terror and duplicity, as he and his comrades in the heterodox Marxist POUM militia were hunted through the streets of Barcelona by the communists who were supposed to be their allies. Of the Russian agent in Barcelona charged with defaming the POUM as Trotskyist Francoist traitors, he writes, in Homage to Catalonia, \"It was the first time that I had seen a person whose profession was telling lies - unless one counts journalists.\" The tail sting is typical black humour. It also reflects his disgust at the way the whole leftwing press in Britain was falsifying events that he had seen with his own eyes. </p> <p>As he says in his 1946 essay Why I Write, after Spain he knew where he stood. He had earlier adopted the pen name George Orwell in preference to his own, Eric Blair, but it was after Spain that he really became Orwell. Every line of his writing was now to have a political purpose. Imperialism and fascism would remain major targets of his generous anger. But the first enemy would be the blindness or intellectual dishonesty of those in the west who supported or condoned Stalinist communism - ever more so after the Soviet Union became the west's ally in the war against Hitler. And so he sat down to write a Swiftian satire on Stalinist Russia, with the communists as the pigs in a farm run by the animals. \"Willingness to criticise Russia and Stalin,\" he wrote in August 1944, \"is the test of intellectual honesty.\" </p> <p>The rejection of Animal Farm by several British publishers, because they did not want to criticise Britain's heroic wartime ally, showed what he was up against. When it was finally published in Britain in 1945 (and the US in 1946), the book was a political event, helping to open the eyes of the English-speaking west to the true nature of the Soviet regime. One might call this the Orwell effect. Nineteen Eighty-Four, with its more generalised dystopia, became another defining cold war text. Not accidentally, the first use of the phrase \"cold war\" recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary comes from an article by Orwell. </p> <p>In short, he was more memorably and influentially right than anyone, and sooner, about the single greatest political menace of the second half of the 20th century, as well as seeing off the two largest horrors of the first half. But those monsters are dead, or on their last legs. To say \"read him because he mattered a lot in the past\" will hardly attract new readers to Orwell. </p> <p>Fortunately, there is a more compelling reason why we should read Orwell in the 21st century. This is that he remains an exemplar of political writing. Both meanings of \"exemplar\" are required. He is a model of how to do it well, but he is also an example - a deliberate, self-conscious and self-critical instance - of how difficult it is. </p> <p>In Why I Write, he says that his purpose, after Spain, was to \"make political writing into an art\". Animal Farm is the work in which he most completely succeeded. In his \"little fairy story\", artistic form and political content are perfectly matched - partly because they are so grotesquely mismatched. What could be further apart than Stalinist Moscow and an English country farmyard? </p> <p>He cared passionately for the English countryside, and lived there in the late 1930s, keeping a village shop, a goat and a notebook. Animal Farm overflows with lovingly observed physical detail of country life. But then, from the mouth of the pig Major, there erupts a perfect parody of a communist speech: the fruit of many hours Orwell had spent poring over the political pamphlets he collected. Only he would have this peculiar combination of expertises. Only Orwell would know both how to milk a goat and how to skewer a revisionist. </p> <p>The twists and turns of his animal regime closely follow the decay of the Russian revolution into tyranny. There is no ambiguity here: the pig Napoleon is Stalin, the pig Snowball is Trotsky. And there is his humour, an underrated part of Orwell's sandpapery charm. (Soon after he was shot through the neck in Spain, his commanding officer perceptively reported: \"Breathing absolutely regular. Sense of humour untouched.\") Unforgettable is that perfect one-liner, at once comic and deeply serious: \"All Animals Are Equal, But Some Animals Are More Equal Than Others\". </p> <p>Animal Farm is a timeless satire on the central comi-tragedy of all politics - that is, the comi-tragedy of corruption by power. This ability to move from the particular to the universal also characterises his essays: the other genre in which he wrote best about politics. </p> <p>What he abhors, perhaps even more than violence or tyranny, is dishonesty. Marching up and down the frontier between literature and politics, like a sentry for morality, he can spot a double standard at 500 yards in bad light. Does a Tory MP demand freedom for Poland while remaining silent about India? Sentry Orwell fires off a quick round. </p> <p>Orwell the moralist is fascinated by the pursuit not merely of truth, but of the most complicated and difficult truths. It starts already with the early essay Shooting an Elephant, where he confidently asserts that the British empire is dying but immediately adds that it is \"a great deal better than the younger empires that are going to supplant it\". At times, he seems to take an almost masochistic delight in confronting uncomfortable truths. </p> <p>Not that his own political judgment was always good. His vivacious and perceptive wife Eileen wrote that he retained \"an extraordinary political simplicity\". There are striking misjudgments in his work. It's startling to find him, early on, repeating the communist line that \"fascism and capitalism are at bottom the same thing\". </p> <p>He opposed fighting Hitler until well into 1939, only to reverse his position. In his wartime tract The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius, he proposes the nationalisation of \"land, mines, railways, banks and major industries\". Orwell was a very English writer, and we think of understatement as a very English quality. But his speciality is outrageous overstatement: \"No real revolutionary has ever been an internationalist,\" \"All leftwing parties in the highly industrialised countries are at bottom a sham,\" \"A humanitarian is always a hypocrite.\" </p> <p>As VS Pritchett observed, in reviewing The Lion and the Unicorn, he \"is capable of exaggerating with the simplicity and innocence of a savage\". But that is what satirists do. Evelyn Waugh, from the other end of the political spectrum, did the same. So this weakness of his non-fiction is one of the great strengths of his fiction. </p> <p>Both his life and his work are case studies in the demands of political engagement. In Writers and Leviathan he describes the political writer's dilemma: \"seeing the need of engaging in politics while also seeing what a dirty, degrading business it is\". After briefly being a member of the Independent Labour party, he concludes that \"a writer can only remain honest if he keeps free of party labels\". That keyword \"honest\" again. But he plans and becomes vice-chairman of a non-party organisation called the Freedom Defence Committee, defending freedom against imperialism and fascism, of course, but now, above all, against communism. </p> <p> A word is due about the already notorious list of crypto-communists and fellow travellers which he is popularly thought to have handed over to the British secret service. (\"Socialist icon who became an informer,\" trumpeted the Daily Telegraph when \"breaking\" the story in 1998.) The facts are these. Orwell kept a pale blue notebook in which he noted names and details of suspected communist agents or sympathisers. The content of this notebook is disquieting, with its sharp judgments - \"almost certainly agent of some kind\", \"decayed liberal\", \"appeaser only\" - and especially its national/racial annotations: \"Jewish?\" (Charlie Chaplin) or \"English Jew\" (Tom Driberg) as well as \"Polish\", \"Jugo-Slav\", \"Anglo-American\" and so on. There is something unsettling - a touch of the old imperial policeman - about a writer who could have lunch with a friend like the poet Stephen Spender and then go home to note \"Sentimental symphathiser and very unreliable. Easily influenced. Tendency to homosexuality.\" </p> <p>However, two very important things need to be said in explanation. First, there was a cold war on. There were Soviet agents and sympathisers about, and they were influential. The most telling example is the man Orwell had down as \"almost certainly agent of some kind\". His name was Peter Smollett. During the second world war he was the head of the Russian section in the Ministry of Information, and it was on his advice that TS Eliot, no less, rejected Animal Farm for Jonathan Cape. We now know that Smollett was indeed a Soviet spy. </p> <p>Second, Orwell did not give this notebook to the British secret service. He gave a list of 35 names drawn from it to the Information Research Department, a semi-secret branch of the Foreign Office which specialised in getting writers on the democratic left to counter the then highly organised Soviet communist propaganda offensive. Absurdly, the British government has not declassified this list and any letter that accompanied it. So we still don't know exactly what Orwell did. But from the available evidence it is quite clear that Orwell was not putting some British thought police on to these people's tails. All he was doing, in effect, was to say: \"Don't use these people for anti-communist propaganda because they are probably communists or communist sympathisers!\" </p> <p>A dying man, but still in complete command of his faculties, Orwell judged this to be a morally defensible act for a writer in a period of intense political struggle, just as he had earlier judged that it was proper for a politically engaged writer to take up arms against Franco. I think he was right. You may think he was wrong. Either way, he exemplifies for us - he is that exemplar - of the dilemmas of the political writer. </p> <p>Finally, of course, Orwell's list, and Orwell's life, are much less important than the work. It matters, to be sure, that there is no flagrant contradiction between the work and the life - as there often is with political intellectuals. The Orwellian voice, placing honesty and single standards above everything, would be diminished. But what endures is the work. </p> <p>If I had to name a single quality that makes Orwell still essential reading in the 21st century, it would be his insight into the use and abuse of language. If you have time to read only one essay, read Politics and the English Language. This brilliantly sums up the central Orwellian argument that the corruption of language is an essential part of oppressive or exploitative politics. \"The defence of the indefensible\" is sustained by a battery of euphemisms, verbal false limbs, prefabricated phrases, and all the other paraphernalia of deceit that he pinpoints and parodies. </p> <p>The extreme, totalitarian version that he satirised as Newspeak is less often encountered these days, except in countries such as Burma or North Korea. But the obsession of democratically elected governments, especially in Britain and America, with media management and \"spin\" is today one of the main obstacles to understanding what is being done in our name. There are also distortions that come from within the press, radio and television themselves, partly because of hidden ideological bias but increasingly because of fierce commercial competition and the relentless need to \"entertain\". </p> <p>Read Orwell, and you will know that something nasty must be hidden behind the euphemistic, Latinate phrase used by Nato spokesmen during the Kosovo war: \"collateral damage\". (It means innocent civilians killed.) Read Orwell, and you will smell a rat whenever you find a British newspaper or politician once again churning out a prefabricated phrase such as \"Brussels' inexorable march to a European superstate\". </p> <p>He does not just equip us to detect this semantic abuse. He also suggests how writers can fight back. For the abusers of power are, after all, using our weapons: words. In Politics and the English Language he even gives some simple stylistic rules for honest and effective political writing. He compares good English prose to a clean window pane. Through these windows, citizens can see what their rulers are really up to. So political writers should be the window cleaners of freedom. </p> <p>Orwell both tells and shows us how to do it. That is why we need him still, because Orwell's work is never done. </p> <p> \u00a9 Timothy Garton Ash 2001.

Animal Farm is a timeless satire on the central comi-tragedy of all politics - that is, the comi-tragedy of corruption by power. This ability to move from the particular to the universal also characterises his essays: the other genre in which he wrote best about politics. What he abhors, perhaps even more than violence or tyranny, is dishonesty. Marching up and down the frontier between literature and politics, like a sentry for morality, he can spot a double standard at 500 yards in bad light. Does a Tory MP demand freedom for Poland while remaining silent about India? Sentry Orwell fires off a quick round. Orwell the moralist is fascinated by the pursuit not merely of truth, but of the most complicated and difficult truths. It starts already with the early essay Shooting an Elephant, where he confidently asserts that the British empire is dying but immediately adds that it is \"a great deal better than the younger empires that are going to supplant it\". At times, he seems to take an almost masochistic delight in confronting uncomfortable truths. Not that his own political judgment was always good. His vivacious and perceptive wife Eileen wrote that he retained \"an extraordinary political simplicity\". There are striking misjudgments in his work. It's startling to find him, early on, repeating the communist line that \"fascism and capitalism are at bottom the same thing\". He opposed fighting Hitler until well into 1939, only to reverse his position. In his wartime tract The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius, he proposes the nationalisation of \"land, mines, railways, banks and major industries\". Orwell was a very English writer, and we think of understatement as a very English quality. But his speciality is outrageous overstatement: \"No real revolutionary has ever been an internationalist,\" \"All leftwing parties in the highly industrialised countries are at bottom a sham,\" \"A humanitarian is always a hypocrite.\" As VS Pritchett observed, in reviewing The Lion and the Unicorn, he \"is capable of exaggerating with the simplicity and innocence of a savage\". But that is what satirists do. Evelyn Waugh, from the other end of the political spectrum, did the same. So this weakness of his non-fiction is one of the great strengths of his fiction. Both his life and his work are case studies in the demands of political engagement. In Writers and Leviathan he describes the political writer's dilemma: \"seeing the need of engaging in politics while also seeing what a dirty, degrading business it is\". After briefly being a member of the Independent Labour party, he concludes that \"a writer can only remain honest if he keeps free of party labels\". That keyword \"honest\" again. But he plans and becomes vice-chairman of a non-party organisation called the Freedom Defence Committee, defending freedom against imperialism and fascism, of course, but now, above all, against communism. A word is due about the already notorious list of crypto-communists and fellow travellers which he is popularly thought to have handed over to the British secret service. (\"Socialist icon who became an informer,\" trumpeted the Daily Telegraph when \"breaking\" the story in 1998.) The facts are these. Orwell kept a pale blue notebook in which he noted names and details of suspected communist agents or sympathisers. The content of this notebook is disquieting, with its sharp judgments - \"almost certainly agent of some kind\", \"decayed liberal\", \"appeaser only\" - and especially its national/racial annotations: \"Jewish?\" (Charlie Chaplin) or \"English Jew\" (Tom Driberg) as well as \"Polish\", \"Jugo-Slav\", \"Anglo-American\" and so on. There is something unsettling - a touch of the old imperial policeman - about a writer who could have lunch with a friend like the poet Stephen Spender and then go home to note \"Sentimental symphathiser and very unreliable. Easily influenced. Tendency to homosexuality.\" However, two very important things need to be said in explanation. First, there was a cold war on. There were Soviet agents and sympathisers about, and they were influential. The most telling example is the man Orwell had down as \"almost certainly agent of some kind\". His name was Peter Smollett. During the second world war he was the head of the Russian section in the Ministry of Information, and it was on his advice that TS Eliot, no less, rejected Animal Farm for Jonathan Cape. We now know that Smollett was indeed a Soviet spy. Second, Orwell did not give this notebook to the British secret service. He gave a list of 35 names drawn from it to the Information Research Department, a semi-secret branch of the Foreign Office which specialised in getting writers on the democratic left to counter the then highly organised Soviet communist propaganda offensive. Absurdly, the British government has not declassified this list and any letter that accompanied it. So we still don't know exactly what Orwell did. But from the available evidence it is quite clear that Orwell was not putting some British thought police on to these people's tails. All he was doing, in effect, was to say: \"Don't use these people for anti-communist propaganda because they are probably communists or communist sympathisers!\" A dying man, but still in complete command of his faculties, Orwell judged this to be a morally defensible act for a writer in a period of intense political struggle, just as he had earlier judged that it was proper for a politically engaged writer to take up arms against Franco. I think he was right. You may think he was wrong. Either way, he exemplifies for us - he is that exemplar - of the dilemmas of the political writer. Finally, of course, Orwell's list, and Orwell's life, are much less important than the work. It matters, to be sure, that there is no flagrant contradiction between the work and the life - as there often is with political intellectuals. The Orwellian voice, placing honesty and single standards above everything, would be diminished. But what endures is the work. If I had to name a single quality that makes Orwell still essential reading in the 21st century, it would be his insight into the use and abuse of language. If you have time to read only one essay, read Politics and the English Language. This brilliantly sums up the central Orwellian argument that the corruption of language is an essential part of oppressive or exploitative politics. \"The defence of the indefensible\" is sustained by a battery of euphemisms, verbal false limbs, prefabricated phrases, and all the other paraphernalia of deceit that he pinpoints and parodies. The extreme, totalitarian version that he satirised as Newspeak is less often encountered these days, except in countries such as Burma or North Korea. But the obsession of democratically elected governments, especially in Britain and America, with media management and \"spin\" is today one of the main obstacles to understanding what is being done in our name. There are also distortions that come from within the press, radio and television themselves, partly because of hidden ideological bias but increasingly because of fierce commercial competition and the relentless need to \"entertain\". Read Orwell, and you will know that something nasty must be hidden behind the euphemistic, Latinate phrase used by Nato spokesmen during the Kosovo war: \"collateral damage\". (It means innocent civilians killed.) Read Orwell, and you will smell a rat whenever you find a British newspaper or politician once again churning out a prefabricated phrase such as \"Brussels' inexorable march to a European superstate\". He does not just equip us to detect this semantic abuse. He also suggests how writers can fight back. For the abusers of power are, after all, using our weapons: words. In Politics and the English Language he even gives some simple stylistic rules for honest and effective political writing. He compares good English prose to a clean window pane. Through these windows, citizens can see what their rulers are really up to. So political writers should be the window cleaners of freedom. Orwell both tells and shows us how to do it. That is why we need him still, because Orwell's work is never done. \u00a9 Timothy Garton Ash 2001.

They have skirted annihilation and damnation. </p> <p>In his biography of Daniel Defoe, Maximillian E Novak sees these characters as direct projections of their author. Defoe was an inspired chancer who made adventurers in his own image. He habitually risked not only his financial security but also his credibility as a writer with any consistent principles. An apparently mercenary hack, employed secretly by governments of every political complexion, he fought to persuade himself of his own integrity. Driven by a \"spirit of defiance and contradiction\", he took risks when he hardly needed to, relishing the war of words that raged in early 18th-century Grub Street. </p> <p>He became a writer after he failed as an entrepreneur, and kept being tempted back into speculative schemes. He tried wine importation, brick manufacture, hosiery and the making of perfume from the glands of civet cats. Twice he was bankrupted, and he was never successful. Novak shows that he made large sums of money as a writer, and lost a good deal of it in commercial speculations. He was \"in every sense a projector\", excited by ingenious schemes rather than hard-earned profits. His first published book was his Essay on Projects (1697), full of ambitious schemes for a new and better nation (from an academy for women to improved schemes for helping bankrupt businessmen). </p> <p>His first novel was not written until he was almost 60. In his lifetime he was famous, or infamous, as a satirist, a journalist and a political polemicist. He left a clear track of enmities, and Novak unfolds a rich record of the attacks and lampoons that he inspired. He made his name with The True-Born Englishman , an anti-Tory satire that celebrated, topically for us, the qualities of a 'mongrel' nation: </p> <p> A True-born Englishman's a contradiction; </p> <p>In speech an irony, in fact a fiction. </p> <p>He forged his future with The Shortest Way with Dissenters , a mischief-making parody of High-Church rhetoric that had him put in the pillory (where he was cheered by the London mob) and then in Newgate Prison. He was rescued by chief minister Robert Harley, who put him to work as a government spy and propagandist. Harley was a Tory, but a man of moderation who seems to have won, and not merely purchased, Defoe's allegiance. Very few Defoe manuscripts survive; his letters to Harley were secured for posterity because they were lodged in secret-service files. Self-dramatising, often self-pitying, they bring alive a writer equally preoccupied with his place in history and his ever-precarious finances. With his self-importance and his pseudonyms, it is almost a surprise to find that he had considerable political influence. Under Harley at least, he spoke for those who ruled. </p> <p>After Harley fell from power, Defoe became a more feverish, less influential writer for various masters, and it becomes impossible to follow him through the twists of his political journalism. He was paid by government agents to supply copy for, even edit, anti-government journals, in order to make them less effective. Enemies sensed what he was up to, and he was often denounced in the press: one typical newspaper article talked of his \"binomical Performance\", deploying \"the little Art he is truly Master of, of forging a Story and imposing on the World for the Truth\". His very employers sometimes seemed confused by the elaborateness of his journalistic imper sonations. Novak sees Defoe the trickster as the apprentice novelist: \"The need to present multiple views helped to shape him into a masterful writer of fiction.\" Even the didactic works of \"family instruction\" brought to life, in sharp dialogues, a rich drama of bourgeois anxiety and soul-searching. </p> <p>Defoe's shape-changing skills as a writer required the anonymity or pseudonymity of most of what he wrote. He was always complaining of all that was attributed to him; if a work was anonymous and controversial, \"it must be the Devil or De Foe\". His particular skill was for creating scenes \"as if he had been on the spot\". So, for instance, he made his New Voyage Around the World seem genuinely to have been written by an intrepid circumnavigator, rather than a clever fabricator with a good library. This gift for inventing the empirical, made him a pioneer of novel-writing; his novel that most brilliantly uses the force of the eyewitness account, A Journal of the Plague Year , was for half a century taken to be the genuine memoir of a man who had lived through this terror. </p> <p>Defoe's talents of impersonation and habits of secrecy have left academics to argue over what he did actually write. He was probably responsible for more pages of print than any other major writer, yet much is irrecoverable. Novak is often oddly confident about his ability to detect Defoe's hand where other scholars have taught caution, yet his biography does have a feel for what made Defoe singular: his audacity, his energy, his gambler's trust in the future. Novak calls him \"an incorrigible futurist\", ever projecting into tomorrow. What made him a great writer was the way he caught in his novels the fears and dangers shadowing the resourcefulness of the modern individualist. The representatives of his brave new commercial world were thieves and pirates before they made good; the free modern individual living with terror and solitude as well as excitement and opportunity.</p>",

He tried wine importation, brick manufacture, hosiery and the making of perfume from the glands of civet cats. Twice he was bankrupted, and he was never successful. Novak shows that he made large sums of money as a writer, and lost a good deal of it in commercial speculations. He was \"in every sense a projector\", excited by ingenious schemes rather than hard-earned profits. His first published book was his Essay on Projects (1697), full of ambitious schemes for a new and better nation (from an academy for women to improved schemes for helping bankrupt businessmen). His first novel was not written until he was almost 60. In his lifetime he was famous, or infamous, as a satirist, a journalist and a political polemicist. He left a clear track of enmities, and Novak unfolds a rich record of the attacks and lampoons that he inspired. He made his name with The True-Born Englishman , an anti-Tory satire that celebrated, topically for us, the qualities of a 'mongrel' nation: A True-born Englishman's a contradiction; In speech an irony, in fact a fiction. He forged his future with The Shortest Way with Dissenters , a mischief-making parody of High-Church rhetoric that had him put in the pillory (where he was cheered by the London mob) and then in Newgate Prison. He was rescued by chief minister Robert Harley, who put him to work as a government spy and propagandist. Harley was a Tory, but a man of moderation who seems to have won, and not merely purchased, Defoe's allegiance. Very few Defoe manuscripts survive; his letters to Harley were secured for posterity because they were lodged in secret-service files. Self-dramatising, often self-pitying, they bring alive a writer equally preoccupied with his place in history and his ever-precarious finances. With his self-importance and his pseudonyms, it is almost a surprise to find that he had considerable political influence. Under Harley at least, he spoke for those who ruled. After Harley fell from power, Defoe became a more feverish, less influential writer for various masters, and it becomes impossible to follow him through the twists of his political journalism. He was paid by government agents to supply copy for, even edit, anti-government journals, in order to make them less effective. Enemies sensed what he was up to, and he was often denounced in the press: one typical newspaper article talked of his \"binomical Performance\", deploying \"the little Art he is truly Master of, of forging a Story and imposing on the World for the Truth\". His very employers sometimes seemed confused by the elaborateness of his journalistic imper sonations. Novak sees Defoe the trickster as the apprentice novelist: \"The need to present multiple views helped to shape him into a masterful writer of fiction.\" Even the didactic works of \"family instruction\" brought to life, in sharp dialogues, a rich drama of bourgeois anxiety and soul-searching. Defoe's shape-changing skills as a writer required the anonymity or pseudonymity of most of what he wrote. He was always complaining of all that was attributed to him; if a work was anonymous and controversial, \"it must be the Devil or De Foe\". His particular skill was for creating scenes \"as if he had been on the spot\". So, for instance, he made his New Voyage Around the World seem genuinely to have been written by an intrepid circumnavigator, rather than a clever fabricator with a good library. This gift for inventing the empirical, made him a pioneer of novel-writing; his novel that most brilliantly uses the force of the eyewitness account, A Journal of the Plague Year , was for half a century taken to be the genuine memoir of a man who had lived through this terror. Defoe's talents of impersonation and habits of secrecy have left academics to argue over what he did actually write. He was probably responsible for more pages of print than any other major writer, yet much is irrecoverable. Novak is often oddly confident about his ability to detect Defoe's hand where other scholars have taught caution, yet his biography does have a feel for what made Defoe singular: his audacity, his energy, his gambler's trust in the future. Novak calls him \"an incorrigible futurist\", ever projecting into tomorrow. What made him a great writer was the way he caught in his novels the fears and dangers shadowing the resourcefulness of the modern individualist. The representatives of his brave new commercial world were thieves and pirates before they made good; the free modern individual living with terror and solitude as well as excitement and opportunity.",

In some undefined division of labour, rather like the chasm that exists in a newspaper office between departments of home and foreign news, one group deals with the metropolis, another with the wider world. As a result, the British are positively discouraged from seeing their homeland and their Empire as an indivisible whole. The seamless web that once linked Westminster and Whitehall with the most distant outposts of Empire has been broken down through these fractured spectacles into its component parts, resembling a patchwork quilt rather than finished cloth. \"British social historians never significantly ventured overseas,\" writes David Cannadine in his new book, \"while imperial social historians rarely ventured to Britain\" - with the result that no authoritative social history of the Empire has ever been written. </p> <p>Cannadine is an adventurous, original and highly accessible historian, and he has sought to resolve this paradox by examining the last 100 years of Empire and motherland - this \"vast interconnected world\" - through a single lens. His ambitious and thoroughly praiseworthy aim is \"to put the history of Britain back into the history of Empire, and the history of Empire back into the history of Britain\". </p> <p>An unusual and initially compelling portrait comes into focus almost immediately. Empire, he argues, was \"the vehicle for the extension of British social structures - to the ends of the world\". The constructs that the British made in the Empire were primarily \"the mirror images of the traditional, individualistic, unequal society that existed in the metropolis.\" </p> <p>The Empire, according to this view, sought to recreate the rural arcadia of Tory England, where local government since the 16th century had been controlled by those with high social prestige. \"This meant that it was in the hands of the traditional authorities, the greater grandees and the lesser gentry, that it was relatively inexpensive, and that it was amateur.\" So was born the \"indirect rule\" system of government that characterised much of the Empire, with power devolved to an entire hierarchy of greater and lesser chiefs. </p> <p>If this was the sum total of his argument, Cannadine's book would have been less contentious. But he moves on to shakier ground when he argues that the Empire was not so much about \"race or colour\" as about \"class and status\". This old-fashioned emphasis on class might warm the cockles of ageing Marxists, and it comes very naturally from the author of Class in Britain . Cannadine might simply argue that he has extended his earlier analysis of conservative, traditional, hierarchical Britain to the imperial arena. </p> <p>Yet if you underplay the role of race in the imperial cocktail, you miss the reason for the Empire's sudden collapse. The first world war over-extended the Empire; the second world war, which turned out, at its end, to have been a war against racism, accelerated its downfall. If it was right to oppose Hitler, it was as necessary to dismantle an Empire that was built on the same racist principles as the Nazi Reich. There is the additional difficulty of the complicity of the great British people in the imperial scheme. If the Germans are blamed for Hitler, should not the British be blamed for their Empire? The imperial system may have been set up by the ruling class, as Cannadine suggests, but a lot of lesser mortals rather enjoyed lording it over people they regarded as their racial inferiors. </p> <p>In this context, there is something curiously perverse about Cannadine's emphasis on the pre-eminence of class over race; he himself shows signs of unease about his fundamental formulation. One chapter of his book, \"Limitations\", deals with some of the drawbacks of his thesis. He claims, rather shamefacedly, that since race has made all the running in recent analytical accounts of Empire, he is merely trying to regain a sense of balance by returning to some of the arguments laid out by Joseph Schumpeter (in Imperialism and Social Classes ) some 50 years ago. Yet a close reading of his text suggests that he really does believe that class is more significant, and in passages of purple prose he makes the most of it. Forget about race, he proposes, think rather about \"antiquity and anachronism, tradition and honour, order and subordination; about glory and chivalry, horses and elephants, knights and peers, processions and ceremony, plumed hats and ermine robes; about chiefs and emirs, sultans and nawabs, viceroys and proconsuls; about thrones and crowns, dominion and hierarchy, ostentation and ornamentalism\". </p> <p>This splendid passage provides Cannadine with his title (a direct attack on Edward Said's Orientalism ), yet once you realise that his jeu d'esprit is essentially confined to the ruling class, you can enjoy the wonderful chapters about the absurdity of the inflated honours system and on the role of the re-invented monarchy - both indissolubly linked to the demands of Empire. Jonathan Freedland suggested in the Guardian recently that royalty is \"an ancient feudal idea\" that rests on \"medieval concepts of bloodline and heredity\", but Cannadine counters this by pointing out that the British variant is rather more firmly rooted in the artificial superstructure of the Empire created in the 19th century. The ridiculously inflated monarchy that the British still retain only ever made sense as the apex and apogee of a great global empire. Without an Empire, it is meaningless. \"Thanks largely to Disraeli,\" writes Cannadine, \"the British monarchy was refurbished and re-invented as an imperial crown of unprecedented reach, importance and grandeur.\" And if only the Empire still existed, and not the miserable Commonwealth, there would still be excellent opportunities for any number of royal duchesses and countesses of Wessex to earn an honest crust. </p> <p>The difficulty about Cannadine's thesis (and his subtitle) is that it is already known \"how the British saw their Empire\". They saw it as pictured on a biscuit tin, or as the label on a bottle, with the native orderly standing outside the campaign tent with a tray of Camp coffee essence, ever at the ready to serve the expectant British officer. Cannadine gives some continuing credence to this vision by recalling, in an appendix, his own nostalgic memories as \"a child of Empire\", born in 1950, of what it was like to live in its misty afterglow. What he fails here to understand, yet what has become ever clearer in much recent research and the concurrent re-examination of the imperial experience, is that the British were in a supreme state of false consciousness about their Empire. When the British \"saw\" their Empire, they did not really know, or they chose not to know (with the exception of a few honourable dissenters over the centuries), what was being done in their name. </p> <p>When Henrietta Marshall published Our Empire Story in 1908, an excellent book in many ways on which most imperial citizens were brought up for more than half a century, she made virtually no reference to the various indigenous populations that the empire-builders encountered. With rather less excuse, Cannadine makes the same mistake, although he admits that the particular vision of Empire he has uncovered was \"an ignorant oversimplification\" of something that was extremely complex. Yet it is rather disingenuous on his part to talk euphemistically about \"colonies of settlement\" when what he means are colonies where the indigenous population has effectively been slaughtered. \"When it comes to the systematic settlement of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa,\" he writes, the British did not hesitate \"to banish the indigenous peoples to the margins of the new imperial society\". The Jews of central Europe were also banished to the margins of society, but we usually dwell rather more on their extermination. </p> <p>I, too, born a decade earlier than Cannadine, have some misty memories of Empire, but they are less upbeat than his. I chiefly remember my headmaster in tears when he heard of the death of his star pupil, Major Earl Wavell, killed during the Mau Mau \"Emergency\" in Kenya in 1954; and I recall the head boy who was shot, during conscription, fighting the anti-imperialist communist guerrillas in Malaya. Nothing very ornamental about those deaths. We now know that the British Empire was essentially a Hitlerian project on a grand scale, involving military conquest and dictatorship, extermination and genocide, martial law and \"special courts\", slavery and forced labour, and, of course, concentration camps and the transoceanic migration of peoples. Whatever way we now look at Empire, this vision must remain dominant. </p> <p>This is very far from being Cannadine's view, but his book is not just a restatement of traditional conservative history, it is a romantic and postmodernist version suitable for the New Labour era. With a simple and plausible idea and an attractive narrative sweep, the burden of imperial guilt can be shifted off the backs of the long-suffering British people as a whole and placed firmly back where it belongs - at the door of the old Tory party. If only things were so simple. </p> <p>Richard Gott is writing a book on imperial repression and resistance.</p>",

The American academic Lipstadt had written, and Penguin had published, accusations against the right-wing historian Irving which, he claimed, had ruined his professional reputation. When the case came to trial last year, the judge himself was anxious to peddle that line. \"This trial is not concerned with making findings of historical fact,\" Mr Justice Gray announced early on. Unavoidably, however, it was. </p> <p>Before the judge could decide who had won the court case, he had to make up his mind on a series of awesome historical questions. How many Jews died in the Holocaust? How many were gassed at Auschwitz? How much did Hitler personally know about the methods and extent of the killings? </p> <p>The problem was that English libel trials are not meant to discover the truth about anything. The process is a highly artificial one, aimed at deciding whether or not published words have tended to diminish someone's reputation. It does so clumsily, relying on a verbal shoot-out between two opposing sets of partial witnesses and their silver-tongued lawyers. At the end, the choice is which bunch to believe. This blunderbuss method may sometimes produce justice; it rarely gets to the truth. </p> <p>But in the Irving case there was no choice. Lipstadt had written that Irving was a denier of the Holocaust, an apologist for Hitler, a distorter of historical evidence in favour of the Nazi version of events. To defend themselves against his libel claim, she and Penguin had to show that what she'd said was true. To do that, in effect, they had to prove the existence of the Holocaust and the gas chambers at Auschwitz all over again, as well as the falsity of Irving's interpretation. </p> <p>DD Guttenplan, an American journalist, sat through every day of the two-month trial in London's Royal Courts of Justice. He also interviewed most of the main participants, including Lipstadt, Irving, many of the lawyers and the judge (who, because of the complexity of the case and the volume of documentation, dispensed with a jury and heard the case himself). </p> <p>His book is, at one level, a straightforward, intelligent account of the proceedings. He manages to make dense and complex issues understandable. Guttenplan's dif ficulty is that the trial itself was not particularly lively. Sparkling moments were infrequent: some forensic sparring between Irving and Richard Rampton QC, Penguin's barrister; occasional clashes between Irving and the expert witnesses; and a few examples of Irving - who, unable to afford expensive lawyers, represented himself skillfully - in full declamatory flow, combining high intelligence with arrogance and naivety. </p> <p>But for the most part it was a dour trial, unleavened by much humour or any sensational revelations. Its explosive highlight should have been the confrontation between alleged victim and accuser; but the defence team decided that Lipstadt should not go into the witness box, thus denying Irving, to his great disappointment, the opportunity to cross-examine her. Only nine witnesses were heard - the tip of the evidential iceberg. Much of the material relevant to the case was contained in detailed reports and other documents, which the judge spent weeks reading. </p> <p>It is not Guttenplan's fault that there are times when the reader's attention may not be gripped; fascination for the minutiae of Auschwitz's building plans has its limitations. The outcome of the trial was predicable and predicted. The judge's 333-page judgment comprehensively vindicated Lipstadt's position and he had some savage criticisms to make of Irving's integrity both as a historian and as a witness during the trial. </p> <p>But the book has another dimension, making it far more interesting than a mere chronicle of a high-profile trial. Guttenplan is clearly uneasy at the haphazardness and inadequacies of the legal process in dealing with such sensitive and large-scale questions. Perhaps he expected too much from the trial - that it would provide an important answer, shed some new light on the Holocaust. He muses on the distances between facts, court evidence, history and truth, and finally spots the missing link. The judge had heard from experts and seen lots of documents. But not a single witness in court was a survivor of, or witness to, the atrocities. \"Without human voices to put flesh on the facts, we have something which, while it may pass muster as history, can never tell the truth.\" He's right, of course, but how could he have thought for a moment that an English libel trial could fulfill that onerous task?</p>",

Lipstadt had written that Irving was a denier of the Holocaust, an apologist for Hitler, a distorter of historical evidence in favour of the Nazi version of events. To defend themselves against his libel claim, she and Penguin had to show that what she'd said was true. To do that, in effect, they had to prove the existence of the Holocaust and the gas chambers at Auschwitz all over again, as well as the falsity of Irving's interpretation. DD Guttenplan, an American journalist, sat through every day of the two-month trial in London's Royal Courts of Justice. He also interviewed most of the main participants, including Lipstadt, Irving, many of the lawyers and the judge (who, because of the complexity of the case and the volume of documentation, dispensed with a jury and heard the case himself). His book is, at one level, a straightforward, intelligent account of the proceedings. He manages to make dense and complex issues understandable. Guttenplan's dif ficulty is that the trial itself was not particularly lively. Sparkling moments were infrequent: some forensic sparring between Irving and Richard Rampton QC, Penguin's barrister; occasional clashes between Irving and the expert witnesses; and a few examples of Irving - who, unable to afford expensive lawyers, represented himself skillfully - in full declamatory flow, combining high intelligence with arrogance and naivety. But for the most part it was a dour trial, unleavened by much humour or any sensational revelations. Its explosive highlight should have been the confrontation between alleged victim and accuser; but the defence team decided that Lipstadt should not go into the witness box, thus denying Irving, to his great disappointment, the opportunity to cross-examine her. Only nine witnesses were heard - the tip of the evidential iceberg. Much of the material relevant to the case was contained in detailed reports and other documents, which the judge spent weeks reading. It is not Guttenplan's fault that there are times when the reader's attention may not be gripped; fascination for the minutiae of Auschwitz's building plans has its limitations. The outcome of the trial was predicable and predicted. The judge's 333-page judgment comprehensively vindicated Lipstadt's position and he had some savage criticisms to make of Irving's integrity both as a historian and as a witness during the trial. But the book has another dimension, making it far more interesting than a mere chronicle of a high-profile trial. Guttenplan is clearly uneasy at the haphazardness and inadequacies of the legal process in dealing with such sensitive and large-scale questions. Perhaps he expected too much from the trial - that it would provide an important answer, shed some new light on the Holocaust. He muses on the distances between facts, court evidence, history and truth, and finally spots the missing link. The judge had heard from experts and seen lots of documents. But not a single witness in court was a survivor of, or witness to, the atrocities. \"Without human voices to put flesh on the facts, we have something which, while it may pass muster as history, can never tell the truth.\" He's right, of course, but how could he have thought for a moment that an English libel trial could fulfill that onerous task?",

Zahid Mubarek was beaten to death by Robert Stewart, a known racist psychopath, after a string of blunders by the prison service. In the wake of outrage over the murder the CRE announced a formal investigation into the prison service errors that led to the death of Mr Mubarek, 19, and into wider racism in Britain's jails. Mr Mubarek's family have asked the high court for a judicial review so they can be represented and can cross-examine witnesses about the events and decisions leading up to the teenager's murder. The family also want the part of the inquiry covering the murder to be held in public. The inquiry has been set up under the 1976 Race Relations Act. The CRE says this does not allow the inquiry to be in public and that the Mubarek family cannot be represented. But the family wantan investigation similar to the Stephen Lawrence one, which proved a watershed in British race relations. The family have also applied for a court order halting the first session of the hearing, which will be in public, when the prison service chief, Martin Narey, and home office minister Paul Boateng will be questioned. Suresh Grover, speaking for the Mubarek family, said: \"The family believe only through public scrutiny of the events leading to Zahid's brutal murder will the real truth ever be known on how the prison service allowed his murder to take place. \"The Lawrence inquiry showed the necessity of families being involved integrally in any inquiry. \"If the CRE do not allow the family to cross-examine witnesses, they're acting extremely shabbily and insensitively and this inquiry will have no integrity.\" However, a CRE spokesman said: \"During the course of the formal investigation we are not allowed to disclose the names of those giving evidence unless they approve.

      "body": "<p>The sponsor's logo on the breeches spelt out \"Red Devil\" as the champion jockey 11 times over hurried into the paddock at Bath on Tuesday. It seemed an appropriate label for the resurgent talents of Patrick James Eddery. Not long ago the diminutive Irishman appeared to have settled for the life of a jobbing professional heading for retirement. But this spring he has been as quick out of the stalls as the most precocious two-year-old. And at Newmarket this afternoon, 27 years after his first Classic victory on Polygamy in the Oaks at Epsom, he will take the reins of the highly regarded Frenchman's Bay in the 2,000 Guineas. </p> <p>Confidence should not be a problem. He had two winners at Newmarket yesterday, including Millenary for John Dunlop in the feature Jockey Club Stakes, and last Sunday produced one of the finest displays of his illustrious career when driving home Golden Snake to take the \u00a348,000 Group One Prix Ganay at Longchamp. The partnership kicked on from the outset and were three lengths clear at the top of the straight. The local runners, waiting complacently for their usual sprint finish, never got back on terms. \"Remember Pat was winning Arcs when Olivier Peslier and the rest were still in short trousers,\" explained Dunlop, Golden Snake's trainer. </p> <p>Racecourse rumour suggests that the 49-year-old Eddery and Dunlop may combine to take other Group One prizes this season, possibly even the Epsom Derby itself with Olden Times, the handsome three-year-old colt they brought out to win the Fielden Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket a fortnight ago. </p> <p>\"Oh, he's got gears,\" says Eddery. \"He could drop back to a mile, no problem. You'd think he ought to have stamina too, as his sire is Darshaan who beat me on Sadlers Wells in the French Derby in '84. But there's a lot of speed on the dam's side and it may be that 10 furlongs will be his limit. But, either way, he's a serious horse.\" </p> <p>A serious horse. Eddery's lexicon never changes but then one of the most striking things about the man is how little he seems to have altered since the mid-70s. He has had no serious weight problems of the kind that almost destroyed Walter Swinburn. Every March he reappears looking tanned and fit after a winter holiday and he will have a new set of wheels to go with his handsome cashmere coats, tailor-made suits and handmade shoes. </p> <p>The manner does not change much either. He still has that old dead-behind-the-eyes look he inherited from Lester Piggott. But then Flat racing is a tough commercial business and the top jockeys - including Frankie Dettori behind the laughter - are all hard men who recognise their worth but also know the importance of keeping their options open. And if Olden Times does not run in the Derby, Eddery may want to team up with Aldwych on whom he scored an eye-catching win in the unofficial Derby trial at Bath on Tuesday. </p> <p>\"He's a nice horse,\" he says. \"He was pulling hard early on and I had to try and settle him, but he's learning. They have to be handy on that left-handed turn out of the back straight at Bath. It wouldn't be the worst preparation for Epsom. When I switched him out and asked him to quicken he did it well. He wasn't fully fit but he'll come on for the run. I like him.\" On such brief post-mortems the hopes of owners, trainers and punters' investments wax or wane at this point in the season. </p> <p>Aldwych is a stable companion of Frenchman's Bay and the two colts work out together regularly on Roger Charlton's gallops. Those close to the yard leave you in no doubt that over distances from six furlongs to a mile Frenchman's Bay shows the form of a top-class thoroughbred. But immaturity may be his biggest problem today as he has only seen a racecourse twice in his life and was beaten into second place in a slowly run Greenham Stakes at Newbury two weeks ago. </p> <p>\"He's crying out for better ground and a faster pace,\" Eddery believes. \"The results of the Classic trials have been turned around in the Guineas before now and on decent going I'd be hopeful of beating that Newbury winner. But don't judge him too harshly on what he does this weekend. He's still growing and he'll be a much better horse in a few months' time.\" </p> <p>Eddery has sat on some of the greatest racehorses of the last quarter of a century, from Grundy to Dancing Brave and Bosra Sham. He has made mistakes, none more glaring than the disastrously overconfident ride that cost him the 1984 Derby on El Gran Senor. But the high points and demonstrations of unflappable nerve more than outweighed the losses. \"I remember standing in the paddock at Longchamp with Khalid Abdullah before the '86 Arc and asking Pat what he thought his tactics might be,\" recalls Dancing Brave's trainer Guy Harwood. \"He gave us that look, a bit like Lester used to do, and just turned away. 'I think I'll hold him up,' he said.\" The rest is history.</p>",

But there's a lot of speed on the dam's side and it may be that 10 furlongs will be his limit. But, either way, he's a serious horse.\" A serious horse. Eddery's lexicon never changes but then one of the most striking things about the man is how little he seems to have altered since the mid-70s. He has had no serious weight problems of the kind that almost destroyed Walter Swinburn. Every March he reappears looking tanned and fit after a winter holiday and he will have a new set of wheels to go with his handsome cashmere coats, tailor-made suits and handmade shoes. The manner does not change much either. He still has that old dead-behind-the-eyes look he inherited from Lester Piggott. But then Flat racing is a tough commercial business and the top jockeys - including Frankie Dettori behind the laughter - are all hard men who recognise their worth but also know the importance of keeping their options open. And if Olden Times does not run in the Derby, Eddery may want to team up with Aldwych on whom he scored an eye-catching win in the unofficial Derby trial at Bath on Tuesday. \"He's a nice horse,\" he says. \"He was pulling hard early on and I had to try and settle him, but he's learning. They have to be handy on that left-handed turn out of the back straight at Bath. It wouldn't be the worst preparation for Epsom. When I switched him out and asked him to quicken he did it well. He wasn't fully fit but he'll come on for the run. I like him.\" On such brief post-mortems the hopes of owners, trainers and punters' investments wax or wane at this point in the season. Aldwych is a stable companion of Frenchman's Bay and the two colts work out together regularly on Roger Charlton's gallops. Those close to the yard leave you in no doubt that over distances from six furlongs to a mile Frenchman's Bay shows the form of a top-class thoroughbred. But immaturity may be his biggest problem today as he has only seen a racecourse twice in his life and was beaten into second place in a slowly run Greenham Stakes at Newbury two weeks ago. \"He's crying out for better ground and a faster pace,\" Eddery believes. \"The results of the Classic trials have been turned around in the Guineas before now and on decent going I'd be hopeful of beating that Newbury winner. But don't judge him too harshly on what he does this weekend. He's still growing and he'll be a much better horse in a few months' time.\" Eddery has sat on some of the greatest racehorses of the last quarter of a century, from Grundy to Dancing Brave and Bosra Sham. He has made mistakes, none more glaring than the disastrously overconfident ride that cost him the 1984 Derby on El Gran Senor. But the high points and demonstrations of unflappable nerve more than outweighed the losses. \"I remember standing in the paddock at Longchamp with Khalid Abdullah before the '86 Arc and asking Pat what he thought his tactics might be,\" recalls Dancing Brave's trainer Guy Harwood. \"He gave us that look, a bit like Lester used to do, and just turned away. 'I think I'll hold him up,' he said.\" The rest is history.",

It's a small word, easy to pronounce, slips off the tongue easily, particularly when you're asked to do something extra, work late, run an errand, fix the photocopier or help out with any one of the endless requests that fly across your desk each day. </p> <p>Saying 'no' regularly allows you to sail through your day undisturbed, achieving your tasks, avoiding diversions and ensuring that you go home bang on 5.30pm. However, it probably also irritates your work-mates, causes resentment and may ultimately harm your career prospects. </p> <p>\"When I got promoted to lending manager, I was determined to do the job to the best of my ability,\" says Simon Barnsley, who works for a merchant bank. \"I focused totally on my responsibilities, made lists of what I had to do each day and systematically worked through them. If anyone came and asked me to do anything I'd invariably turn them down - not through a desire to be unhelpful, but because I believed nothing was as important as the work I was doing.\" </p> <p> It's all too easy to slip into this kind of mind-set, but being focused on yourself and your job to the exclusion of everything else doesn't necessarily bring the best results. \"This is a real can't-do attitude,\" believes business consultant Charles Kay. \"The first reaction is always negative - it will take too long, interrupt my work, cause a distraction.

      "bodyText": "No! It's a small word, easy to pronounce, slips off the tongue easily, particularly when you're asked to do something extra, work late, run an errand, fix the photocopier or help out with any one of the endless requests that fly across your desk each day. Saying 'no' regularly allows you to sail through your day undisturbed, achieving your tasks, avoiding diversions and ensuring that you go home bang on 5.30pm. However, it probably also irritates your work-mates, causes resentment and may ultimately harm your career prospects. \"When I got promoted to lending manager, I was determined to do the job to the best of my ability,\" says Simon Barnsley, who works for a merchant bank. \"I focused totally on my responsibilities, made lists of what I had to do each day and systematically worked through them. If anyone came and asked me to do anything I'd invariably turn them down - not through a desire to be unhelpful, but because I believed nothing was as important as the work I was doing.\" It's all too easy to slip into this kind of mind-set, but being focused on yourself and your job to the exclusion of everything else doesn't necessarily bring the best results. \"This is a real can't-do attitude,\" believes business consultant Charles Kay. \"The first reaction is always negative - it will take too long, interrupt my work, cause a distraction. It is also selfish - constantly putting yourself first may enable you to work more quickly, but it betrays a lack of interest or concern in the office as a whole and your colleagues individually.\" Simon Barnsley admits that it wasn't until he started to be on the receiving end of sarcastic comments from some of his colleagues that he realised his attitude was causing problems. \"There are around 15 people in my department and occasionally global emails go round asking for help with a specific problem,\" he says. \"A couple came round that were titled 'Everyone except Simon,' and when I asked the sender why, she said there was no point in asking me for help as I always said no.

What are the rooms like? Staggeringly gorgeous. Oak-timbered four-posters very likely slept in by Queen Elizabeth I, who owned the place; sofas; lots of cushions; big windows with luscious view. The bed test A great night's sleep had by all; especially good if you draw the curtains on the four-poster. The bathroom test: Under-floor heating, glamorously-overflowing bath, twin sinks. And some very, very nice towels. The restaurant: Impeccable food (especially the chocolate fondant) and the most charming waiter ever (particularly good if you want gossip from the Bridget Jones set). Side-by-side seating was slightly odd. The lounge: Very relaxing, more cushions. What is there to see within walking distance? Just the grounds: golf, tennis, the lake. What is there to see within a 10-minute drive? The bourgeois quartet of Windsor, Eton, Henley and Ascot are terribly near. Otherwise, there's Slough. How much a night? Doubles from \u00a3245 a night. Two-night Bridget Jones package (champagne, breakfast, dinner, BJ goodies) \u00a3235pp.",

      "body": "<p>Mortgage advisers are giving people biased advice and making misleading claims that could add thousands of pounds to the cost of their home loan, according to research from the Consumers' Association published this week. </p> <p>An investigation of 48 mortgage advisers carried out by Which? found that getting good advice is a hit and miss affair. Much depends on the individual adviser rather than who the adviser works for. Only one adviser - at a Bradford and Bingley branch - was found to give all round good advice. </p> <p>The researchers visited 40 branches of the top 10 lenders plus four estate agents and four independent financial advisers (IFAs). </p> <p>Most of the advisers were good at explaining the range of deals available, but some just talked about the one they rec ommended. \"This doesn't involve customers in the choice and means they can't be sure that the deal is the best one for them,\" says the report. It's also a breach of the mortgage code, the voluntary code of practice that most lenders and intermediaries sign up to. </p> <p>Two-thirds of advisers failed to fully assess the researchers' needs before recommending a deal, again a breach of the code. Such action can leave the customer with the wrong deal. </p> <p>In outlining the deals, some advisers used jargon without explaining it and many failed to explain redemption penalties - the charges levied on some deals if you want to pay off all or some of your loan within a set period. </p> <p>An adviser should impartially explain the pros and cons of both repayment methods. With a repayment mortgage, each month you pay your lender interest plus a portion of the original capital loan so that you are guaranteed to have repaid the full loan by the end of the mortgage term. With an interest-only mortgage, you pay only interest to your lender, so the amount of capital you owe never goes down. You also normally pay into an investment vehicle such as an Isa, endowment or pension, with the aim that it will grow fast enough to repay the capital at the end of the term. </p> <p>There is no guarantee that your investment will perform well enough for this to happen. On the other hand, it might produce enough to repay the mortgage capital and give you an extra lump sum. </p> <p>The right repayment method for you depends on your attitude to risk. Yet, according to Which?, one-third of those who gave advice on the best way to repay the loan failed to establish the researchers' attitude to risk - another breach of the code. </p> <p>The investigation also found that misleading advice about repayment mortgages was widespread, with many advisers wrongly painting them as inflexible. Thirteen advisers said you'd hardly pay off any of the capital loan in the first few years, and 14 wrongly claimed that repayments were inflexible because, if you moved, you'd have to start again with another 25-year loan. </p> <p>In fact, taking a loan over a shorter period can save thousands of pounds. For instance, assuming an interest rate of 7.5%, a \u00a370,000 repayment mortgage over 20 years would increase monthly repayments by \u00a350, but save almost \u00a320,000 in interest over the life of the mortgage. Very few advisers discussed this option. </p> <p> By contrast, some advisers seemed too cautious to recommend anything other than repayment mortgages. \"Some did so without asking about our researchers' attitude to risk - they seemed to assume that a repayment is best for everyone, which isn't the case,\" says the report. \"Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester advisers were particularly prone to this.\" One plus point was that not one adviser recommended an endowment mortgage. </p> <p>All but seven of the advisers (two Abbey National, two Halifax, one NatWest, one Woolwich and one IFA) mentioned the Mortgage Code. This was a vast improvement on the last Which? mortgage advice investigation in 1998 when fewer than half mentioned the code. But explaining the code isn't enough - complying with it is more important, says Which?. </p> <p>Helen Parker, editor of Which?, says: \"We will continue to press for mortgage advice to be properly regulated by law. In the meantime we welcome moves by the Mortgage Code Compliance Board to introduce compulsory training for mortgage advisers.\" </p> <p><strong>Stand up for yourself</strong><br></p> <p>\u0095 Arm yourself with as much information as you can about the types of deals (eg fixed, capped, discounted, cashback) and repayment methods available before you go for advice. </p> <p>\u0095 If you want advice, rather than just information, make sure you tell the adviser that you want a recommendation of what's best for you. </p> <p>\u0095 Ask the adviser to tell you about the deals they offer and to go through the pros and cons of each. </p> <p>\u0095 Think about your circumstances and future plans (eg do you want to pay extra off on your mortgage? Is your income likely to change dramat ically in the next few years?).

      "bodyText": "Mortgage advisers are giving people biased advice and making misleading claims that could add thousands of pounds to the cost of their home loan, according to research from the Consumers' Association published this week. An investigation of 48 mortgage advisers carried out by Which? found that getting good advice is a hit and miss affair. Much depends on the individual adviser rather than who the adviser works for. Only one adviser - at a Bradford and Bingley branch - was found to give all round good advice. The researchers visited 40 branches of the top 10 lenders plus four estate agents and four independent financial advisers (IFAs). Most of the advisers were good at explaining the range of deals available, but some just talked about the one they rec ommended. \"This doesn't involve customers in the choice and means they can't be sure that the deal is the best one for them,\" says the report. It's also a breach of the mortgage code, the voluntary code of practice that most lenders and intermediaries sign up to. Two-thirds of advisers failed to fully assess the researchers' needs before recommending a deal, again a breach of the code. Such action can leave the customer with the wrong deal. In outlining the deals, some advisers used jargon without explaining it and many failed to explain redemption penalties - the charges levied on some deals if you want to pay off all or some of your loan within a set period. An adviser should impartially explain the pros and cons of both repayment methods. With a repayment mortgage, each month you pay your lender interest plus a portion of the original capital loan so that you are guaranteed to have repaid the full loan by the end of the mortgage term. With an interest-only mortgage, you pay only interest to your lender, so the amount of capital you owe never goes down. You also normally pay into an investment vehicle such as an Isa, endowment or pension, with the aim that it will grow fast enough to repay the capital at the end of the term. There is no guarantee that your investment will perform well enough for this to happen. On the other hand, it might produce enough to repay the mortgage capital and give you an extra lump sum. The right repayment method for you depends on your attitude to risk. Yet, according to Which?, one-third of those who gave advice on the best way to repay the loan failed to establish the researchers' attitude to risk - another breach of the code. The investigation also found that misleading advice about repayment mortgages was widespread, with many advisers wrongly painting them as inflexible. Thirteen advisers said you'd hardly pay off any of the capital loan in the first few years, and 14 wrongly claimed that repayments were inflexible because, if you moved, you'd have to start again with another 25-year loan. In fact, taking a loan over a shorter period can save thousands of pounds. For instance, assuming an interest rate of 7.5%, a \u00a370,000 repayment mortgage over 20 years would increase monthly repayments by \u00a350, but save almost \u00a320,000 in interest over the life of the mortgage. Very few advisers discussed this option. By contrast, some advisers seemed too cautious to recommend anything other than repayment mortgages. \"Some did so without asking about our researchers' attitude to risk - they seemed to assume that a repayment is best for everyone, which isn't the case,\" says the report. \"Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester advisers were particularly prone to this.\" One plus point was that not one adviser recommended an endowment mortgage. All but seven of the advisers (two Abbey National, two Halifax, one NatWest, one Woolwich and one IFA) mentioned the Mortgage Code. This was a vast improvement on the last Which? mortgage advice investigation in 1998 when fewer than half mentioned the code. But explaining the code isn't enough - complying with it is more important, says Which?. Helen Parker, editor of Which?, says: \"We will continue to press for mortgage advice to be properly regulated by law. In the meantime we welcome moves by the Mortgage Code Compliance Board to introduce compulsory training for mortgage advisers.\" Stand up for yourself \u0095 Arm yourself with as much information as you can about the types of deals (eg fixed, capped, discounted, cashback) and repayment methods available before you go for advice. \u0095 If you want advice, rather than just information, make sure you tell the adviser that you want a recommendation of what's best for you. \u0095 Ask the adviser to tell you about the deals they offer and to go through the pros and cons of each. \u0095 Think about your circumstances and future plans (eg do you want to pay extra off on your mortgage? Is your income likely to change dramat ically in the next few years?). Make sure you tell the advisers about them - don't wait to be asked - and get them to explain why the mortgage they've recommended is suitable for you. \u0095 Think about your attitude to risk. Do you want a guarantee that you will repay your mortgage by the end of the term? Or are you happy to go with a repayment method that doesn't give you that guarantee? \u0095 Be aware of the myths: You don't have to take a mortgage over 25 years. Ask the adviser to quote on a 20-year term or less as well as the standard 25-year term. And repayment mortgages aren't bad if you want to move.",

Personally, I detest the sight of a bullfinch - or of bullfinches, rather, as they always feed in parties. In the days when they abounded, there was a wide range of shrubs and trees that it was pointless to try and grow. Plums were regularly stripped of flower and leaf buds. It was the same with many cherries. Prunus subhirtella was reduced to writhing, leafless branches. No forsythia blossom, kerria, weigela, exochorda, nor apples (except Bramley, which was spared, for some reason). It was a long list. But then, in the early 80s, bullfinches disappeared from the region where I live and I have joyfully returned to these excluded plants. Bullfinches are beautiful, but handsome is as handsome does. </p> <p>I welcomed the return of the sparrowhawk after its near extinction by aldrin and similar farm chemicals, later banned, but those who deliberately feed birds and enjoy the feel-good sensation of seeing the creatures regale themselves at the table provided, are usually loud in their wails of protest against its resurrection. </p> <p>The fact is that we find it difficult to accept nature in the raw. We want it on our own terms. Those terms will vary according to our interests. \"I fed it all the winter and now it's eating all my fruit,\" you hear in protest against a blackbird. What did you expect? Shouldn't the blackbird's song be compensation enough? Apparently not.</p>",

On the whole, we must be pleased, but there are always less welcome side-effects. We tend to be selective about birds we like and those we resent. Personally, I detest the sight of a bullfinch - or of bullfinches, rather, as they always feed in parties. In the days when they abounded, there was a wide range of shrubs and trees that it was pointless to try and grow. Plums were regularly stripped of flower and leaf buds. It was the same with many cherries. Prunus subhirtella was reduced to writhing, leafless branches. No forsythia blossom, kerria, weigela, exochorda, nor apples (except Bramley, which was spared, for some reason). It was a long list. But then, in the early 80s, bullfinches disappeared from the region where I live and I have joyfully returned to these excluded plants. Bullfinches are beautiful, but handsome is as handsome does. I welcomed the return of the sparrowhawk after its near extinction by aldrin and similar farm chemicals, later banned, but those who deliberately feed birds and enjoy the feel-good sensation of seeing the creatures regale themselves at the table provided, are usually loud in their wails of protest against its resurrection. The fact is that we find it difficult to accept nature in the raw. We want it on our own terms. Those terms will vary according to our interests. \"I fed it all the winter and now it's eating all my fruit,\" you hear in protest against a blackbird. What did you expect? Shouldn't the blackbird's song be compensation enough? Apparently not.",

The older I got, the more confident I became, and the more I grew into my hair. Being black was no longer something to be ashamed of; in fact, it became desirable. But the longer my hair got, the harder it was to style, so for most of my time at university I had a root perm to make the hair drop, rather than grow upwards. On one occasion when I was having my roots re-done, the hairdresser offered to blow-dry it straight, so I could see if I wanted to get it \"done\" properly. I hated it. I couldn't help feeling I'd let the side down. &amp;3149; Hannah Pool's column on black beauty appears weekly.",

      "bodyText": "Jill Dando was murdered on the doorstep of her home with a single shot to the side of the head by an obsessive who had an \"exaggerated interest in well-known figures, the army and the media\", the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Barry George, 41, was seen by witnesses loitering and behaving strangely outside the TV star's home in Gowan Avenue, Fulham, hours before she was killed at 11.30am on April 26, 1999. But when police questioned Mr George about the killing, he initially denied he had left his ground floor flat in nearby Crookham Road before noon, and claimed he had never heard of Miss Dando, and did not know what she looked like. Later, Mr George changed his alibi and said he had walked to a nearby community centre, taking an unusual route which avoided Gowan Avenue. \"Why did he choose to take the longer route?\" asked Orlando Pownall, prosecuting counsel. \"He had just shot Jill Dando and did not want to be recognised.\" The evidence was heard on the first day of a much anticipated trial in court one at the Old Bailey before Mr Justice Gage. Mr George, who denies murdering Miss Dando, sat quietly in the dock, head slightly bowed and scribbling notes, just feet away from the presenter's fiance, Alan Farthing and her brother, Nigel. The court heard what Mr Pownall called \"compelling categories of circumstantial, forensic and scientific evidence\" that had implicated Mr George. Mr Pownall admitted there was no apparent motive for the murder, no witnesses had seen the shooting and no weapon had been recovered. But he told the jury of seven women and five men that Mr George's personality, and his behaviour on the day Miss Dando died, were \"persuasive of guilt.\" Mr George had adopted several names of people he admired over the years, including Thomas Palmer, an SAS soldier, and Barry Bulsara, the birth name of the late Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the rock group Queen. When the police searched his home, officers found a large number of documents, magazines and photographs of presenters and newscasters. Three years before Miss Dando's death, a man fitting Mr George's description and claiming to be Freddie Mercury's cousin, told a jeweller he had met Princess Diana and \"the woman from Crimewatch\", the court heard. Mr Pownall added: \"Whether he harboured a hidden grudge against (Miss Dando), believing her to have wronged him or figures he idolised, such as Freddie Mercury, is impossible to determine. \"However, if he did not know who she was before, his reaction to her death was out of all proportion to what one might expect from an individual who was not an admirer and would not have even recognised her. \"He visited shops and sought letters of condolence.

But the celebrity connection cut no ice last week when Mr Golding senior tried to move into one of the city's residential homes only to be told he would not be welcome - because he was black. The band's lineup of black and white musicians, and blend of reggae, ska and punk, may have been an important multicultural influence in the late 1970s, but its message clearly did not reach a group of white pensioners at the home. They threatened to walk out if Mr Golding senior, who is 76 and suffers from emphysema, moved in. Despite the efforts of the home's proprietor to distance himself from their attitudes, Mr Golding's family have made a formal complaint to the council and to Coventry's race equality council. But they believe the incident also raises wider issues about care provision for Britain's ageing ethnic minority population, 50 years after the first wave of Caribbean immigrants to the UK. \"When my dad first came to England from Jamaica in 1953, there were signs on guest houses saying 'No blacks, no Irish, no dogs',\" said Lynval Golding. \"He had to sleep in a shed for two weeks, because he could not find anywhere to live.

Ageing auteurs still thrive (Claude Chabrol's latest, Merci Pour Le Chocolat, starring Isabelle Huppert, did well here), while such young film makers as Catherine Breillat, Eric Zonca, Robert Gu\u00e9diguian and Claire Denis show that French cinema is artistically at the cutting edge. This week's big French release in Paris is a documentary about a French thinker, Pierre Bourdieu, entitled Sociology is a Combat Sport.

      "body": "<p>As I write this, I still don't know whether, by the time you read it, I will be on strike. My best guess is that we will still be in limbo, deadlocked, but not actually striking yet. The enormity of what a strike would mean- or, more to the point, cost - has sunk in, and there have been panicky attempts by powerbrokers outside Hollywood, including LA's mayor and California's governor, to push the two sides together. Until now, it has been as if we were all on board the Titanic, steaming toward the fateful iceberg, with this difference: the captain and his passengers were eerily aware of the impending catastrophe and mesmerised by it. </p> <p>At issue - in a dispute involving 11,000 screenwriters and 120,000 actors - have been money, union-busting . . . and respect. </p> <p>The contract between my own union, the Writers Guild of America (WGA), and the bosses - Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) - expired on May Day. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and its sister union, American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), have been threatening to strike eight weeks later. Last year SAG actors, not known for militancy, staged a strike in the commercial ads industry for six difficult months, the longest actors' walkout in history. Tempers ran high. A few big names such as Elizabeth Hurley and Tiger Woods blacklegged by making TV commercials. Even bigger names such as Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks donated $100,000 each to the strike fund. SAG's stoppage was the curtain raiser to this week's showdown. </p> <p>The Economic Development Corporation estimated a strike would cost the the city of Los Angeles half a billion dollars a week - $250 million in lost wages and another $257 million indirectly in the neighbourhood delis, auto repair shops, dry cleaners, hair salons and personal trainers that depend on movie pay checks. Those kinds of figures concentrate the mind. The real decision makers are not Hollywood \"suits\" but multinational CEOs in New York, London, Berlin, Paris and - who knows? - Melbourne, if Rupert Murdoch is visiting. Forget the \"golden age\" of Fox, Metro and Columbia. Think AOL-Time Warner, Viacom, Sony, Vivendi and Murdoch's News Corporation, the conglomerates which now own the movie business and for which picture grosses are a mere footnote. </p> <p>\"The control of the business is out of the hands of short Jewish men from Brooklyn. That's scary,\" sighed a producer recently. It's scary because the men from Brooklyn, even when they were (almost to a man) conservative Republicans who despised unions, were members of a social compact, rooted in the shtetls of eastern Europe, that culturally dictated that there was enough pie for everybody and a tough settlement was better than a long strike. Of course, it didn't always work out that way. In the 30s and 40s, there were bloody picketline clashes between unions and the studios. </p> <p>Hollywood's dirtiest secret is not sex but industrial relations. Class struggle - incognito, schmoozed over, never spoken about openly - is at the very core of how business is done. \"Negatives not people count in this company town,\" a successful TV producer told me. In current movie-making jargon, actors, directors and writers such as myself are (and always have been) interchangeable \"elements\" in a \"product\". The new, potent element is \"vertical integration\". Simply, it means that a Viacom or AOL-Warner might own a studio that manufactures a movie and also own all the distribution channels that screen the final \"content\". This fresh potential source of income for writers - the heart of the dispute - includes TV, cable, satellite, fibre optic networks, video and DVD, foreign distribution (which accounts for an increasing share of movie grosses), and soon, internet sites and \"wireless entertainment networks\" that nobody quite understands yet. </p> <p>The writers' and actors' unions became restless because at each step of the new technology this monopoly of production and distribution makes millions - in the case of a blockbuster such as Titanic, hundreds of millions - from the sale of just one product. The pie grows, but the pie makers have been getting less of it percentage-wise. Even after the WGA reduced by 75% its demand for an increase in DVD residuals - or an extra penny per sale - the producers' offer was a zero increase. The entertainment corporations, emboldened by an anti-labour Bush administration in the White House, made it clear they were out for blood. </p> <p>That our Hollywood lives are being ordained in faraway places by tycoons who don't know a grip from a best boy is not flash news. Even back in the silent era, Hollywood moguls genuflected to New York or Boston banks. True, the Golden Age's feudal studio system was managed by famous names such as Harry Cohn (who liked to do business sitting on a toilet), Sam Goldwyn and LB Mayer, but the real power, to whom they were accountable, lay with paymasters at Morgan Guaranty and Chase Manhattan. The Atlantic sea-board bankers let the vulgar moguls make the deals and screw the starlets and bribe shady union officials and break the honest unions, but ultimate authority rested 3,000 miles away in Wall Street boardrooms. </p> <p>It says something about how the film business is normally conducted that Hollywood, in the grip of strike fever for the past few months, has rarely been more businesslike. \"It's like in the old times when each studio had to grind out a movie every week,\" a talent manager told me. \"I wish it was always this efficient. I even get my phone calls answered the same day.\" </p> <p>New movies have been stockpiled; agents have been pushing their stars into back-to-back projects just to keep them working; writers in mountain retreats have scribbled overtime to finish scripts before the deadline. Yet it's estimated that the studios' pell-mell rush to squeeze film product through the pipeline has actually been more expensive (in exorbitantly paying star talent, for example) than settling with the unions. At the moment, only $100million - the cost of one big, bad Hollywood blockbuster such as Godzilla - is all that separates the combatants. </p> <p>Inevitably, producers began, ever so gently, wink wink, to suggest privately to writers, ahem, \"If there's a strike, of course, we know contractually you won't be able to work, but maybe, in your spare time, you might, well, you know, give our script a little tweak or two . . .\" In other words, blackleg. Such hints didn't come from the lips of producers who are Neanderthal, anti-abortion, rightwing George Dubya fanatics. This is not currently Hollywood's style. In the bad old days, the bosses and their mink-draped wives were famous for giving generously to worthy orphans, United Jewish Appeal, Gandhi and the Red Cross. They just didn't want to give money to writers or deal with unions. At least they had the integrity to vote Republican. Now, almost to a man or woman, the studio heads are liberal Democrats whose cash hearts bleed for battered wives, Aids victims, Taliban-oppressed Afghan women and Hillary Clinton. However, their philanthropic compassion often stops with the people who work for them. (Ask their maids and nannies.) </p> <p>There are other Hollywood anomalies. This is the first dispute I've been involved in where my union leadership resembles the bosses more than the ordinary members. The writers' guild president, John Wells, is a \"hyphenate\" - an outrageously wealthy writer-producer of TV shows such as West Wing and ER. He probably makes 60 times more money in a week than the management negotiators he's been facing across a table do in a year. Included in the union's team have been its chief negotiator, John McLean, for 25 years a CBS network official, and Charles Holland, former head of business affairs for Rupert Murdoch. Behind this cautious, business-oriented leadership, there is a strong, united union. Contrarily, SAG, the actors' union, is so faction-split that police had to be called to a recent mass meeting. </p> <p>That strike became such a real possibility is thanks to ideological radicals such as Murdoch, Disney's Robert Iger and DreamWorks' Jeff Katzenberg - and their corporate masters and peers. The producers have boasted openly of the economic benefits of a strike in cutting payrolls and getting rid of the \"deadwood\" of producer deals gone sour, not to mention the sheer primitive pleasure of humbling the union. </p> <p>It would take a Freud or perhaps Marx to lay bare the deep, ancestral roots of the film industry's equivocal attitude to labour unions. Most producers and CEs (creative executives) I meet haven't a clue about the virulent Hollywood traditions that shape their relationships with colleagues and underlings. History simply does not exist for them, except perhaps in the likes of Braveheart and Gladiator. Yet it is history that gave weight to the strike threat. </p> <p>It took blood and guts to build Hollywood unions in the face of fierce, sometimes brutal resistance from the producers. Almost from the start, the studios preferred buying labour peace from corrupt, Mob-tied union bosses to dealing with clean and militant workers. Hollywood's record of industrial relations is stained by paternalistic and arbitrary work rules, blacklists and police-and-brickbat violence when bribery and threats failed. The watershed Conference of Studio Unions (CSU) strike at major studios in 1945 - in which unionists traded punch for punch with strikebreakers - escalated into a lockout that helped unleash the Red-baiting Hollywood Ten purges that allowed the studios to crush CSU and take total control of the production process. There is a sense in which the unions never quite came back from the 1945-46 defeat. </p> <p>Who are the screenwriters, anyway? </p> <p>Most of us are independent business people who work from job to job and are treated like workers on an assembly line. In Hollywood's glory days, when films were 70 minutes long and credits flashed on the screen for a few seconds only, the writers were often as oddball as their movies. You'd get strange types with real life experience - first world war aviators, oil field roustabouts, taxi drivers, hookers, proletarian novelists, communist playwrights, fake Viennese noblemen, and hordes of drunken journalists such as Herman Mankiewicz and Ben Hecht. Snuffling for easy cash, the writers would rather have cut their throats than burble about \"cinema art\" or \"creative responsibility\". The phenomenal Hecht (Nothing Sacred, Notorious) laughed at the whole credits system, and didn't give a damn if his name was on the screen or not. But, of course, that was before residuals - that is, money the Guild won for writers from theatrical and TV reruns. </p> <p>Today's Hollywoodised culture, its tentacles in every small town and academic film department, promiscuously breeds screenwriters. Once upon a time, carhop waitresses dreamed of being \"discovered\" like Lana Turner; farmhands wanted to be Clark Gable. Now they write scripts. Eleven-year-old children are \"into\" screenwriting as a normal stage between Pok\u00e9mon and first sex. Many of my colleagues spring directly from the loins of film school or have studied screenwriting in college or writers' workshops. </p> <p>College educated or not, writers - in Rodney Danger-field's immortal phrase - still \"don't get no respect\". At the recent Academy Awards, veteran screenwriter Ernest Lehman (North By Northwest) plaintively pleaded the writers' case. \"It all starts with the script,\" he remarked to the splendidly coiffed Academy audience, who normally clap hands for anybody, including a trained seal. Lehman's thinly veiled show of solidarity with WGA noticeably failed to provoke applause from the Academy's brave souls. </p> <p>As Yorkshire and South Wales coal miners know, work stoppages are about dignity as well as money. Screenwriters (and actors) are astonishingly low on the Hollywood status ladder. The myth that writers are \"schmucks with typewriters\" and actors cattle is hard to kill. Thus, \"respect\" became a (muted) strike issue. Among WGA's lesser demands was the end of the monstrous \"possessory credit\" - the tagline \"A Film By\" - that some directors grab to show writers and everyone else involved in a movie's collaboration that nobody counts except the \"helmer\". My union, a little unconvincingly, also staked a claim for writers to be involved on the set so their scripts won't be tinkered with by directors and stars. And pigs will fly, too. </p> <p>Lack of respect for writers was built into the very first basic Guild agreement in l942. It contained the fatal clause: \"The studio hereinafter referred to as the author.\" Unlike plays and novels, a screenplay, once sold, belongs to the buyer not to the author. </p> <p>I support my union 100%, except on this issue. Respect stinks. Give me the money, and minimum courtesy, and you can shove respect. Writers do their best work when they are least respectable. When they are, in fact, schmucks with typewriters. For me, respect implies respectability which too often translates into pretentiousness, of which - take a look at any movie more than 90 minutes long - we have an oversupply. Writers should be cautious of getting above themselves. We are worker-craftsmen and women, no less, no more. Let's not get too solemn about the dream-images we put on paper, draft after flagellated draft until a Final, Final Shooting Script is complete, eight or nine other writers having had \"creative input\". (I'm not complaining - I've been one of the eight or nine .) </p> <p>My normal strikeless day in Hollywood involves writing scenes, pitching ideas to studio execs, scanning the trade paper Variety for my daily anxiety attack, inventing and discarding blue-sky \"concepts\", staring into my writing partner's baby blues, scratching my nose and trying to figure out a market trend before it happens (eg, teenage-oriented movies, hot yesterday, tanking disastrously today). The game plan for a strike, is to keep on writing but not turn anything in, while maybe going back to that long-lost novel - or going a little crazy. Actors are more used to second jobs (waiting table, massage therapy) than writers, but I've had a return to taxi driving at the back of my mind. The fact is, hitherto, the Guild has never won anything important, including its pension plan and superb health benefits, without a strike. The present crisis may yet yield an unexpected benefit: solidarity instead of personal competitiveness, and militancy where least expected. Last year's actors' walkout educated a lot of normally apolitical or conservative union members. Each generation invents its own passions, as the studio bosses may discover to their chagrin. </p> <p>I've been on strike before, though never as a screenwriter. In a corner of my secret heart, I looked forward to a strike now, confident in my union leadership, my union brothers and sisters, and in the perhaps sentimental knowledge that I am helping to bring history up to date, from that night in 1933 when a group of 10 writers - including two of the later Hollywood Ten, Lester Cole and John Howard Lawson - gathered at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood to brainstorm a different kind of union, a dream this time for themselves and not the producers.</p>",

However, their philanthropic compassion often stops with the people who work for them. (Ask their maids and nannies.) There are other Hollywood anomalies. This is the first dispute I've been involved in where my union leadership resembles the bosses more than the ordinary members. The writers' guild president, John Wells, is a \"hyphenate\" - an outrageously wealthy writer-producer of TV shows such as West Wing and ER. He probably makes 60 times more money in a week than the management negotiators he's been facing across a table do in a year. Included in the union's team have been its chief negotiator, John McLean, for 25 years a CBS network official, and Charles Holland, former head of business affairs for Rupert Murdoch. Behind this cautious, business-oriented leadership, there is a strong, united union. Contrarily, SAG, the actors' union, is so faction-split that police had to be called to a recent mass meeting. That strike became such a real possibility is thanks to ideological radicals such as Murdoch, Disney's Robert Iger and DreamWorks' Jeff Katzenberg - and their corporate masters and peers. The producers have boasted openly of the economic benefits of a strike in cutting payrolls and getting rid of the \"deadwood\" of producer deals gone sour, not to mention the sheer primitive pleasure of humbling the union. It would take a Freud or perhaps Marx to lay bare the deep, ancestral roots of the film industry's equivocal attitude to labour unions. Most producers and CEs (creative executives) I meet haven't a clue about the virulent Hollywood traditions that shape their relationships with colleagues and underlings. History simply does not exist for them, except perhaps in the likes of Braveheart and Gladiator. Yet it is history that gave weight to the strike threat. It took blood and guts to build Hollywood unions in the face of fierce, sometimes brutal resistance from the producers. Almost from the start, the studios preferred buying labour peace from corrupt, Mob-tied union bosses to dealing with clean and militant workers. Hollywood's record of industrial relations is stained by paternalistic and arbitrary work rules, blacklists and police-and-brickbat violence when bribery and threats failed. The watershed Conference of Studio Unions (CSU) strike at major studios in 1945 - in which unionists traded punch for punch with strikebreakers - escalated into a lockout that helped unleash the Red-baiting Hollywood Ten purges that allowed the studios to crush CSU and take total control of the production process. There is a sense in which the unions never quite came back from the 1945-46 defeat. Who are the screenwriters, anyway? Most of us are independent business people who work from job to job and are treated like workers on an assembly line. In Hollywood's glory days, when films were 70 minutes long and credits flashed on the screen for a few seconds only, the writers were often as oddball as their movies. You'd get strange types with real life experience - first world war aviators, oil field roustabouts, taxi drivers, hookers, proletarian novelists, communist playwrights, fake Viennese noblemen, and hordes of drunken journalists such as Herman Mankiewicz and Ben Hecht. Snuffling for easy cash, the writers would rather have cut their throats than burble about \"cinema art\" or \"creative responsibility\". The phenomenal Hecht (Nothing Sacred, Notorious) laughed at the whole credits system, and didn't give a damn if his name was on the screen or not. But, of course, that was before residuals - that is, money the Guild won for writers from theatrical and TV reruns. Today's Hollywoodised culture, its tentacles in every small town and academic film department, promiscuously breeds screenwriters. Once upon a time, carhop waitresses dreamed of being \"discovered\" like Lana Turner; farmhands wanted to be Clark Gable. Now they write scripts. Eleven-year-old children are \"into\" screenwriting as a normal stage between Pok\u00e9mon and first sex. Many of my colleagues spring directly from the loins of film school or have studied screenwriting in college or writers' workshops. College educated or not, writers - in Rodney Danger-field's immortal phrase - still \"don't get no respect\". At the recent Academy Awards, veteran screenwriter Ernest Lehman (North By Northwest) plaintively pleaded the writers' case. \"It all starts with the script,\" he remarked to the splendidly coiffed Academy audience, who normally clap hands for anybody, including a trained seal. Lehman's thinly veiled show of solidarity with WGA noticeably failed to provoke applause from the Academy's brave souls. As Yorkshire and South Wales coal miners know, work stoppages are about dignity as well as money. Screenwriters (and actors) are astonishingly low on the Hollywood status ladder. The myth that writers are \"schmucks with typewriters\" and actors cattle is hard to kill. Thus, \"respect\" became a (muted) strike issue. Among WGA's lesser demands was the end of the monstrous \"possessory credit\" - the tagline \"A Film By\" - that some directors grab to show writers and everyone else involved in a movie's collaboration that nobody counts except the \"helmer\". My union, a little unconvincingly, also staked a claim for writers to be involved on the set so their scripts won't be tinkered with by directors and stars. And pigs will fly, too. Lack of respect for writers was built into the very first basic Guild agreement in l942. It contained the fatal clause: \"The studio hereinafter referred to as the author.\" Unlike plays and novels, a screenplay, once sold, belongs to the buyer not to the author. I support my union 100%, except on this issue. Respect stinks. Give me the money, and minimum courtesy, and you can shove respect. Writers do their best work when they are least respectable. When they are, in fact, schmucks with typewriters. For me, respect implies respectability which too often translates into pretentiousness, of which - take a look at any movie more than 90 minutes long - we have an oversupply. Writers should be cautious of getting above themselves. We are worker-craftsmen and women, no less, no more. Let's not get too solemn about the dream-images we put on paper, draft after flagellated draft until a Final, Final Shooting Script is complete, eight or nine other writers having had \"creative input\". (I'm not complaining - I've been one of the eight or nine .) My normal strikeless day in Hollywood involves writing scenes, pitching ideas to studio execs, scanning the trade paper Variety for my daily anxiety attack, inventing and discarding blue-sky \"concepts\", staring into my writing partner's baby blues, scratching my nose and trying to figure out a market trend before it happens (eg, teenage-oriented movies, hot yesterday, tanking disastrously today). The game plan for a strike, is to keep on writing but not turn anything in, while maybe going back to that long-lost novel - or going a little crazy. Actors are more used to second jobs (waiting table, massage therapy) than writers, but I've had a return to taxi driving at the back of my mind. The fact is, hitherto, the Guild has never won anything important, including its pension plan and superb health benefits, without a strike. The present crisis may yet yield an unexpected benefit: solidarity instead of personal competitiveness, and militancy where least expected. Last year's actors' walkout educated a lot of normally apolitical or conservative union members. Each generation invents its own passions, as the studio bosses may discover to their chagrin. I've been on strike before, though never as a screenwriter. In a corner of my secret heart, I looked forward to a strike now, confident in my union leadership, my union brothers and sisters, and in the perhaps sentimental knowledge that I am helping to bring history up to date, from that night in 1933 when a group of 10 writers - including two of the later Hollywood Ten, Lester Cole and John Howard Lawson - gathered at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood to brainstorm a different kind of union, a dream this time for themselves and not the producers.",

It's raw, visceral, brutal, profane, hilarious and deeply true about the darkness underlying the American Empire: politics as street crime moved up a rung. That one-page preface (\"America was never innocent.

There are only a few guests, and Ellroy's one of them. I tell him why I think American Tabloid is the Great American Novel. He loves that, and in return tells me that When We Were Kings (the 1997 Oscar-winning Muhammad Ali documentary, which I co-produced) is crap. I love that too, and afterwards we set off to join two homicide cop friends of his for a bar crawl before some late-night boxing bout they're in town for. I'd imagined some hard-drinking, chain-smoking, red-meat-chomping, in-your-face-and-who's-asking kind of guy. But as we sit there, nursing our San Pellegrinos while the detectives hit the bourbon, I find out he's a non-smoking, non-drinking vegetarian. Though he's definitely an alpha male, there's even an old-fashioned courtesy about him, but with his brilliantly filthy mouth and the world's most fabulous, grotesque and gory true-crime stories to tell, he's a fun guy to hang out with. The cops clearly love him too. </p> <p>Though best known in Britain for LA Confidential, the novel that redefined Los Angeles noir and spawned a hit movie, the one that's made the most impression lately is his memoir of his search for his mother's killer, My Dark Places. Now 53, Ellroy was 10 years old when she was murdered, and by the age of 11 he was obsessed with true crime literature.

This is their turf, and they're talking about their world: the overwhelming physical evidence against OJ; the spinning, pinwheel eyes of Richard \"Night Stalker\" Ramirez; the autopsies conducted by Dr Noguchi (\"coroner to the stars\"). Two men in particular stand out: Detective Rick Jackson broke the Oswaldo Perez case, nabbing a 17-year-old serial killer after just three break-in murders of women living alone; Detective Bill Stoner of the LA County Sheriff's Department broke the Cotton Club murders, and reopened the investigation of the 1958 death of Ellroy's mother, Geneva Hilliker Ellroy. Rick and Bill are now among Ellroy's closest friends. </p> <p> 11 January 2001: Tonight it's the turn of the Sheriff's Department, with a special guest - Larry Harnisch, a journalist from the LA Times. After years of self-financed research, he's come up with a new theory about the infamous Black Dahlia murder, and he's here to expound it before two of the world's experts on the murder: Ellroy, and Detective Brian Carr, the current custodian of the Black Dahlia files. As America's most famous unsolved murder, it remains under active investigation by the LAPD, more than 50 years after 22-year old Elizabeth Short's severed and mutilated body was discovered lying in a vacant lot on the morning of 15 January 1947. </p> <p>The Pacific Dining Car is creaking with scepticism. The sheriffs are half cut, and giving Larry the third degree, while Ellroy looks on with delight. Larry is nervous and long-winded and the cops are not impressed when he argues that there's no proof that Short was hooking. Rather, she seems to have had a fine line in what one of the detectives delicately calls \"prickteasing\", so another detective figures it was a justifiable homicide. In the midst of this scurrilous debate, Nick Nolte wanders in, wearing his trademark all-day dressing gown, and takes a seat. Again, the movie star is ignored. </p> <p>Larry grinds towards his conclusion, assembling his evidence brick by brick, and one by one the cops fall silent - his theory is persuasive and covers all the known facts of the case. By the time he unleashes his clincher - why the enraged killer slit the Black Dahlia's face into that grotesque bloody grin, and why the killing happened on the exact date it did - the place is electric with tension. Both Ellroy and Detective Carr agree that Larry's theory is watertight. At this moment, in the film, we reveal the only existing photograph of Larry's suspect. </p> <p>My documentary is not for the squeamish. We show explicit pictures of the crime scenes for both Mrs Ellroy and the Black Dahlia's murders. The autopsy pictures of Elizabeth Short are more shocking than imagination can prepare anyone for. But my use of them is not for shock value: it's a deliberate mirror of Ellroy's literary technique. </p> <p>Violence - particularly violence against women - too often serves writers and film-makers as an easy plot device, or it gets aestheticised and sanitised. We are inured to the reality of violence, which is messy, terrible and which, once experienced, never leaves our consciousness. But as Ellroy says in the film, \"Closure is bullshit.\" I believe Ellroy, who has been exposed to violence in the most intimate way, is determined not to let the results of violence heal over. He stares unblinkingly at the worst things humans are capable of, trying to get to the true meaning. And the true meaning is not pretty. Look away and you let the bastards get away with it. </p> <p>Another surprise: Ellroy is a profound moralist. Why? Because he's on to something that only artists can reach. A truth which is truer than the facts themselves can ever be. By writing about unsolved real murders - or unresolved ones, such as the JFK hit - Ellroy is concerned with what gives rise to such killings, not who. Who is for the cops to find out - Ellroy's job is to use fiction to reach beyond the facts for the essential, fundamental truth of real things. Isn't that what art is for? I think so. *</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has personally intervened to defuse the growing crisis over the future of the London Underground before the election by giving Ken Livingstone's transport commissioner Bob Kiley a free hand to make a deal with the companies bidding to take over half of the tube. Mr Kiley has been appointed chairman of London Transport, following meetings with the prime minister and John Prescott, with authority to negotiate changes to the government's public-private partnership (PPP) scheme to give him unified management control of the underground. The surprise announcement by Mr Prescott last night follows weeks of public conflict over the part-privatisation plans - with Gordon Brown playing a pivotal role in blocking agreement with Mr Kiley - which risked spilling over into the election campaign. With the open endorsement of the prime minister and negotiations scheduled to begin on Tuesday, the hope is now that the private consortiums bidding to run track, stations and signalling will concede Mr Kiley's demand for public control of the tube network. Despite the breakthrough, Mr Kiley warned last night that he was not \"brimming over with confidence\" that a deal with the contractors was possible and he has refused to abandon next month's high court challenge to the PPP, saying he still regarded the scheme as \"utterly unacceptable\". Last night's announcement was described by the Tory transport spokesman Bernard Jenkin - who predicted months of negotiation before there was a settlement - as \"the most astonishing and dramatic u-turn\", carried out on the eve of a bank holiday weekend to \"try to minimise the embarrassment\". Under the terms of yesterday's agreement, Mr Kiley will take over from Sir Malcolm Bates immediately as chairman of London Transport - London Underground's parent body - and open negotiations with the \"preferred bidders\" announced by Mr Prescott last Wednesday to achieve unified management control within some form of PPP structure. Mr Blair last night \"warmly welcomed\" the agreement, as did Mr Livingstone. \"I've met with Bob Kiley,\" Mr Blair said, \"heard his concerns and have confidence in his ability to deliver a PPP which meets those concerns and ours and will be good for London.\" Mr Prescott added that he was \"delighted that we have now found a way towards unified management control within the framework of the PPP\". Mr Kiley nevertheless cautioned that yesterday's agreement was \"a beginning, not an end\" and said he was not sure that \"satisfactory modifications to the PPP to meet my concerns are possible\". Referring to Mr Prescott's decision to press ahead with the announcement of preferred bidders for two sets of deep lines this week, he said it was a move with which he disagreed and one which \"could have an impact on my ability to persuade the private firms to accept my point of view\". But Mr Kiley believes that it will become clear very quickly, before the election, whether the consortiums hoping to sign 30-year contracts to take over the tube infrastructure - and the financial institutions planning to finance them - will be prepared to accept the minimum changes he believes necessary.",

      "body": "<p>The government has joined the row over Camelot's refusal to pay a \u00a33m jackpot to a couple who lost their winning national lottery ticket. </p> <p>The culture secretary, Chris Smith, told BBC1's Question Time on Thursday that the lottery operator should \"see reason\" over its refusal to pay Kay and Martyn Tott, from Watford, Hertfordshire, despite concluding that their claim to have lost the winning ticket was genuine. </p> <p>Yesterday, Downing Street publicly backed Mr Smith's comments, and criticised the rules preventing a pay-out. </p> <p>The couple had seen their numbers, a combination of anniversary and birthday dates, appear in a March 5 television appeal which was looking for winners who had not claimed their prize from a draw on September 6. </p> <p>There were just hours left before the 180-day claims deadline ran out and the Totts immediately rang Camelot. However, they had failed to register their ticket as being lost within 30 days of the draw. </p> <p>Kay, 24, and Martyn, 33, then endured seven weeks of investigation. Finally, Camelot decided the claim was genuine but said the 30-day rule meant the money could not be paid without damaging the integrity of the lottery. </p> <p>Asked by the programme's presenter, David Dimbleby, whether he would force Camelot to pay up or risk losing its licence, Mr Smith said: \"Well, they've got their licence back, but I hope that they will actually see reason in this matter.\" He told an audience member who asked whether Camelot should pay: \"There is no legal requirement on them to do so, but if I were them, I would.\" </p> <p>Mr Tott, a purchasing manager, said yesterday: \"I am pleased that someone of his stature in the government is supporting this.

      "bodyText": "The government has joined the row over Camelot's refusal to pay a \u00a33m jackpot to a couple who lost their winning national lottery ticket. The culture secretary, Chris Smith, told BBC1's Question Time on Thursday that the lottery operator should \"see reason\" over its refusal to pay Kay and Martyn Tott, from Watford, Hertfordshire, despite concluding that their claim to have lost the winning ticket was genuine. Yesterday, Downing Street publicly backed Mr Smith's comments, and criticised the rules preventing a pay-out. The couple had seen their numbers, a combination of anniversary and birthday dates, appear in a March 5 television appeal which was looking for winners who had not claimed their prize from a draw on September 6. There were just hours left before the 180-day claims deadline ran out and the Totts immediately rang Camelot. However, they had failed to register their ticket as being lost within 30 days of the draw. Kay, 24, and Martyn, 33, then endured seven weeks of investigation. Finally, Camelot decided the claim was genuine but said the 30-day rule meant the money could not be paid without damaging the integrity of the lottery. Asked by the programme's presenter, David Dimbleby, whether he would force Camelot to pay up or risk losing its licence, Mr Smith said: \"Well, they've got their licence back, but I hope that they will actually see reason in this matter.\" He told an audience member who asked whether Camelot should pay: \"There is no legal requirement on them to do so, but if I were them, I would.\" Mr Tott, a purchasing manager, said yesterday: \"I am pleased that someone of his stature in the government is supporting this. It is double standards on Camelot's part. They could well sink lower, and lower yet, but I am encouraged by all the coverage we have received. \"I think that Camelot may now have a bitter pill to swallow over this, and this may be just the pill they need.\" A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture admitted the problems were exacerbated by the little-known 30-day rule. She said: \"It would be a lot simpler without the 30-day rule because then they wouldn't have had a chance and that would have been that.\" Camelot insisted it was forced to withhold payment, and that not to do so would \"open the floodgates\" to similar claims and jeopardise the entire lottery system. In a statement it said: \"It is not a question of 'seeing reason' - it is about upholding rules that protect the national lottery and its ability to raise funds for the public good.\" The Totts' claim is gathering momentum, aided by the PR consultant Max Clifford and celebrities speaking out on their behalf.",

Trumpets resound as the music swells into a crescendo of urgency. It is the sound of battle.</p> <p>Graphics dissolve to reveal a man gazing into the camera. He wears a double-breasted suit and tight smile. Before the jingle has died he begins to talk, quickly, for there is much to say.</p> <p>Today a great leader has shared his wisdom with the people. He has come among the poor, the jobless, the fearful, to offer hope. A sunlit upland awaits and he knows how to get there.</p> <p>But the presenter looks sad. Something else happened today. Some idiots - there is no other word - attacked the leader. They hurled abuse and lies and threats. They massacred his character, invented stories and even had the cheek to steal his ideas. No, today the news is not good.</p> <p>And this is the news, six nights a week, on Retequattro, a national television network in Italy. It is the domain of Emilio Fede, the anchor and editor-in-chief. He punctuates broadcasts with sweeps of an arm, purrs of approval and gasps of horror. No story is complete without comment.</p> <p>Mr Fede veers from apoplexy to euphoria. \"Those communists never change,\" is one of his favourite expressions, referring to Italy's centre-left. \"There they go again.\"</p> <p>Mr Fede has a hero. He calls him The Knight (Cavaliere) and says \"he is my Bible\". The hero is Silvio Berlusconi, 64, Italy's richest man, founder of the Forza Italia party, head of the centre-right opposition and favourite to win next Sunday's general election. He is also Mr Fede's boss.</p> <p>Retequattro is just one part of a vast media empire which gives Mr Berlusconi unrivalled influence over public opinion. His Mediaset company also runs Italy's two other private television networks, Canale 5 and Italia 1. His family also owns a newspaper, Il Giornale, and Italy's biggest publishing group, Mondadori. The billionaire is eight days away from spawning the biggest conflict of interest in any western democracy. Polls suggest his coalition will beat the government on May 13 despite an international uproar branding him unfit for office.</p> <p>\"The separation of powers which states rely on to protect democracy would be destroyed. You cannot allow a democracy to depend on the goodwill of one man,\" said James Walston, a historian at the American University of Rome.</p> <p>European partners are concerned and amazed: how could Italy let this happen? How blatantly does Mr Berlusconi exploit his empire? How dangerous would he be once in control of state television? The answers are surprising but not reassuring.</p> <p>Mr Berlusconi says a conflict of interest law will be passed during his first 100 days in office and that an announcement about the sale of Mediaset will be made next week. Sceptics predict many loopholes but the Cavaliere responds with a smile: trust me.</p> <p>Despite what some overexcited supporters shout, he is no Duce. He does not vet his media's output like Benito Mussolini, who stayed up late rewriting the next morning's headlines. \"I have not once made a phone call to the office to see what's going on since 1994,\" he says.</p> <p><b> Devoted employees</b><br></p> <p>That was the year he was elected prime minister and formed a government which collapsed in acrimony and corruption charges after seven months. He clawed back credibility with the help of media employees chanting the mantra that leftwing magistrates cooked up baseless accusations.</p> <p>None come more devoted than Mr Fede. His paens are legendary, earning the nickname Fido from his master's aides. Unedited Berlusconi speeches and press conferences dominate his broadcasts. When reporting on the left the anchor rolls his eyes.</p> <p>Police have seized recordings on suspicion that a law guaranteeing equal air time to left and right has been breached. Preliminary analysis: two hours devoted to Mr Berlusconi, three minutes to his rival, Francesco Rutelli. Privately Mr Berlusconi admits Fede is an embarrassment but says Retequattro's audience of mostly housewives is too small to matter.</p> <p>The news on Italia 1, aimed at the young, depicts a country overrun by criminals and illegal immigrants - echoes of the Cavaliere's election campaign. The editor, Mario Giordano, enjoys bashing the left.</p> <p>Independent watchdog figures calculated that from mid March to mid April Mediaset's networks devoted 11 times more coverage to Mr Berlusconi than Mr Rutelli. Even so, it is less partisan than before: no advertisements for Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, fewer celebrity endorsements. Mediaset's chairman, Fedele Confalonieri, instructed staff to give equal coverage to the other side during the election.</p> <p>The flagship channel, Canale 5, has largely done so under its respected head of news, Enrico Mentana. Two weeks ago he was the only anchor to report a Berlusconi gaffe when he appeared to accuse the centre-left of terrorism. Maurizio Costanzo, a star chat show host, is left-wing. Yet insiders say self-censorship is routine. \"Lines exist and we do not cross them. It's a question of tone. No one has to tell us.\"</p> <p>Two weeks ago Mr Berlusconi did exactly that, phoning to carpet Mr Mentana for the gaffe story. \"It was very tense,\" said one staffer. That was unusual and the Cavaliere is trying to dissuade the anchor from jumping to a rival network, knowing Canale 5's credibility would suffer.</p> <p>Panorama, an influential weekly magazine, champions its patron and rubbishes his opponents. Il Giornale, a national daily newspaper owned by Paolo Berlusconi, turned partisan after his brother entered politics.</p> <p>Indro Montanelli, the dean of Italian journalists, quit as editor in protest. \"Without my knowledge he came into the newsroom and said everything must now be changed because now the newspaper must be put at his service.\"</p> <p>What would make a Berlusconi victory so alarming is the control of the three state television and broadcasting networks, called Rai. Almost the entire broadcasting system in the world's sixth-largest industrialised economy would then be in one man's hands.</p> <p>For the past five years Rai has balanced media power by supporting the ruling centre-left. \"That would change under Berlusconi because Rai has always been on the side of the winner,\" said Claudio Lodici, a political scientist.</p> <p>In 1994 Mr Berlusconi tried to purge unfriendly faces at its headquarters in Viale Mazzini, near the Vatican. Less need this time. Over the past year key journalists and executives have been detected toning down criticism of the likely new boss. They went too far when Rai failed to report the Berlusconi gaffe covered by Canale 5. An internal inquiry is under way. \"Some people are not turning up at editorial conferences so they can distance themselves from the news,\" said one insider.</p> <p>Professor Walston has noted the same trend in supposedly independent newspapers. \"Many columnists are university academics who rely on government funding for their departments. There is trimming of sails because the wind is changing.\"</p> <p>An oft-floated solution to the dilemma of a potential conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi as leader of Italy and the country's dominant media figure is a blind trust. When he was last in power in 1994 he made a similar proposal, but his government collapsed before it came to anything.</p> <p>Under this model an independent fiduciary, typically a bank, would manage the tycoon's assets until he leaves office. Yet his holding company, Fininvest, is probably too big and in any case his son Piersilvio and daughter Marina are in senior positions. No one believes they would stay mum at the dinner table.</p> <p>The other solution would be to sell Mediaset. Rupert Murdoch and Telecom Italia are both interested but Mr Berlusconi worries they would bounce out his children. He also worries he could fall from office prematurely, leaving him stripped of influence. He has promised to make an announcement next week but resents the pressure.</p> <p>His indignation filled a Palermo sports hall last week. \"To think that I, after all I have done for democracy, would take my place in the prime minister's office to take advantage of that position of power for my own interests, is a joke that no one can take seriously.\"</p> <p>On Retequattro that night Emilio Fede took that as his cue to laugh heartily.</p> <p><b>Would-be PM set on road by property boom</b></p> <p><b> 1936 </b></p> <p>Born the son of a Milanese banker.</p> <p><b> 1959</b></p> <p>Becomes property developer and cashes in on Milan building boom.</p> <p><b> 1978</b></p> <p>Launches local cable channel, Milano 2.</p> <p><b> 1980</b></p> <p>Channel goes national, becoming Canale 5.</p> <p><b> 1983-84</b></p> <p>Buys Italia 1 and Retequattro.</p> <p><b> 1990</b></p> <p>Law safeguarding his concentration of ownership passed with help of Bettino Craxi, leader of Socialists.</p> <p><b> 1991</b></p> <p>Beats rival tycoon Carlo De Benedetti for control of the Mondadori publishing group.</p> <p><b> 1993 </b></p> <p>Founds Forza Italia party after Socialists and Christian Democrats consumed in corruption scandal.</p> <p><b> 1994</b></p> <p>Elected prime minister as head of centre-right coalition which crumbles after seven months.

      "bodyText": "William Hague rallied to the defence of his beleaguered shadow spokesman Alan Duncan last night as a government minister called for him to be sacked over claims that he helped bust oil sanctions against apartheid South Africa. The Tory leader made it clear that he will take no action over the allegations, published in yesterday's Guardian, against a member of his trade and industry team so near an election. Richard Caborn, a trade minister and a former treasurer of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said the millionaire oil trader and MP for Rutland and Melton should be dismissed if he does not resign. \"Duncan's got to consider his position, particularly given the warm reception Nelson Mandela has received this week from the British public,\" he said. Two fellow oil traders claim Mr Duncan was involved in managing covert shipments from Brunei to South Africa in defiance of UN and other sanctions while working for Marc Rich, a billionaire US fugitive controversially pardoned by President Clinton. Documents seen by the Guardian lend weight to the traders' claims about the rightwinger's role while based in Singapore between 1984 and 1986. Labour MPs are threatening to raise the issue in the House of Commons next week but Mr Hague hopes the controversy over Mr Duncan, his former landlord as well as a friend and colleague, will blow over. When asked whether Mr Hague intended to respond to calls for him to investigate, a Tory spin doctor said sarcastically: \"The answer is he is not taking any action in the wake of the Guardian's amazing story.\" Rich's company, Marc Rich &amp; Co, was labelled the \"No 1 embargo buster\" in the 1980s by the anti-apartheid Amsterdam Shipping Research Bureau. Mr Duncan has dismissed allegations that he was involved in the trade as \"malicious and false\", although he has declined to answer detailed questions in public. Documentary evidence published in yesterday's Guardian and copied to Mr Duncan were concerned with shipments of Brunei crude oil which ended up in South Africa. Mr Duncan says the documents were copied to him by mistake. The fuel was sold by a Brunei company to a Japanese trading house and then sold on to Rich who chartered tankers to take it to South Africa where he was paid up to 80% above the market price. Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrats' trade and industry spokesman, said: \"Serious allegations have been made and they require serious answers from the Conservatives.\" Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham, said: \"Until such time as Alan Duncan has given a full and frank account of his work for Marc Rich in the period when Mr Rich was one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, it would be advisable for Mr Duncan to consider his position as a shadow front bench spokesman.\" Mr Duncan is no stranger to controversy.

Mr Kiley has been appointed chairman of London Transport, following meetings with the prime minister and John Prescott, with full authority to negotiate changes to the government's public-private partnership (PPP) scheme to give him unified management control of the underground. The surprise announcement follows weeks of conflict over the part-privatisation plans - with Gordon Brown blocking agreement between Mr Prescott and Mr Kiley - which risked spilling over into the election campaign. It is expected that the private consortiums bidding to run track, stations and signalling will concede on Mr Kiley's demands for management control, but next month's court challenge to the imposition of PPP has not been called off. Mr Blair said last night: \"I've met with Bob Kiley, heard his concerns and have confidence in his ability to deliver a PPP which meets those concerns and ours.\" Mr Prescott added that he was \"delighted that we have now found a way towards unified management control within the framework of the PPP\". But Mr Kiley cautioned that yesterday's agreement was \"a beginning, not an end\" and said that he was not sure that \"satisfactory modifications to the PPP to meet my concerns are possible\".

Bevin had immediately called a meeting in Paris under his chairmanship, where 16 European countries agreed on a combined reply.</p> <p>Bevin laid before the Truman administration a detailed plan for European cooperation, to be administered by a new organisation called the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation, the OEEC. Without Bevin's initiative, Marshall's speech might have remained just an unfulfilled aspiration. With the united response Bevin had engineered, Washington had no choice but to take Marshall's proposals seriously. So the hugely successful post-war Marshall Plan was launched.</p> <p>Today a similar opportunity exists for a British prime minister and foreign secretary to bring together the countries deeply affected by American plans for missile defence, both European allies like Germany and Denmark, and former antagonists like Russia. The purpose is of fateful importance - to save and update the fragile network of multilateral arms agreements and arms control mechanisms that have helped to keep peace between nuclear powers for 50 years.</p> <p>Within that network, a missile defence system directed against states attempting to threaten others could add to international security. Outside it, and in particular if a unilateral missile defence bypassed such existing treaties as the 1972 ABM treaty, the world could become much more dangerous.</p> <p>The US has, for 60 years since Pearl Harbour, been the foundation of western defence, the \"indispensable nation\" to use the phrase of the former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright. The responsibilities shouldered have been fully discharged. During the cold war, the US led the successful western strategy of containing, and then undermining, the Soviet Union, without any direct military clash.</p> <p>The end of the cold war not only changed the nature of the military threat, to include terrorism, civil war, the building of missiles and other weapons of mass destruction by fanatical states outside the ambit of the cold war powers. Combined with globalisation - the opening of closed borders to trade - it has brought a whole range of new challenges, organised crime, drug-resistant disease, Aids, people-trafficking, and made us aware of others, like climate change. None of these challenges can be countered by military responses. They require multilateral responses, and those need trust between nations.</p> <p>The danger of the Bush proposal is that essentially it is unilateral in tone. As his spokesman put it, it is the responsibility of the US to lead, and of the allies to follow. But that cannot be the basis of a successful multilateral peacekeeping structure. Are we to have genuine consultation, about a scheme not yet set in stone?</p> <p>In his cautious parliamentary replies on Wednesday, Tony Blair spoke of studying US proposals in detail, and of making sure that \"whatever different views there may be are reconciled not just here but everywhere\". He specifically referred to Russia. It is a great pity that the nuances of those answers were not reflected in the remarks of Alastair Campbell, headlined by the Tory press to suggest total UK compliance with the US. For this is the most important foreign policy decision for years.</p> <p>President Bush indicates that he favours a multi-layered missile defence system, which would breach the ABM treaty so seriously that it is hard to see what could be rescued from its remains. Yet missile defence is not technically proved, and it may take years to construct an accurate system. US estimates suggest, at the earliest, three or four years for the first stage. So what will protect the world from proliferation in those years? At the very least, existing arms control systems should remain in place, respected by those who signed them, until they are updated.</p> <p>Missile defence undermines the credibility of deterrence systems relying on small numbers of warheads. China has only 20 nuclear warheads at present, and is clearly tempted to embark on nuclear rearmament. Both Russia and China have threatened in the past to \"mirv\" their warheads.</p> <p>China has been particularly sensitive about space-based missile defence, which she would regard as a reason for building anti-satellite weapons. The hitherto peaceful use of space has provided satellites for telecommunications, climate monitoring and much else of huge value to the human race. The consequences of militarising space are incalculable.</p> <p>Weakening the network of arms control systems also weakens the constraints on new nuclear states to abide by the non-proliferation and test ban treaties. And there is the danger of developing a Maginot line mentality, setting up defences against last year's threat of missiles from North Korea and Iraq, when the threat of weapons of mass destruction delivered in suitcases and boxes, in particular biological weapons which require no missiles to disrupt the infrastructure of modern industrial states, is at least equivalent.</p> <p>The UK and Denmark are hosts to crucial early warning and listening stations. They are, in a sense, therefore, complicit to any American decision to abandon the ABM treaty. No wonder that Blair laid so much stress on Russia, a Russia that does now seem willing to engage cooperatively in a new structure of arms control and defence. But it is depressing that the Bush administration has recently cut the funds allocated for securing and protecting Russia's huge arsenal of decaying nuclear weapons and fissile materials.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the elements of a new multinational arms control system are there. Bush has declared his willingness to reduce dramatically the number of US strategic nuclear warheads. Brought within the Start 2 Treaty, which both the US Congress and the Russian state duma have ratified, that would be a good first step. Russia is willing to cooperate on early warning systems and a common missile defence. European countries are desperate to retain existing measures to contain nuclear proliferation and nuclear testing. President Bush himself referred to \"common responsibilities, common defence\" in his speech on Monday.</p> <p>The development of a missile defence system could mean disaster for an interdependent world; or it could mean a huge opportunity to build a new international structure capable of keeping the peace in a post-cold war world dazzled by technology but desperately in need of political answers.

Launch a Healthcare Fund at the bottom of the market in 1990. What do you find most annoying in your staff? Their constant raids on my, sorry our, biscuit tin.

      "bodyText": "Investment group Merrill Lynch yesterday showed how even the most successful of stock pickers have been hit hard by the implosion of the dot.com bubble, by pulling the plug on an internet fund that has lost more than $800m (\u00a3556m) in just over a year. The Internet Strategies Fund, which opened with $1.1bn in investors money two weeks after what turned out to be the peak of the technology laden Nasdaq market in the US, has lost 80% of its value in 13 months. The residual $215m capital will now be rolled into Merrill's Global Technology Fund, which invests in a broader range of technologies than just the internet. \"It has become apparent that the internet is now so integrated into other technologies that it is no longer the sub-sector it was 13 months ago,\" said Christine Walton, a Merrill Lynch spokeswoman. \"Given market conditions over the past couple of months and the change in the way internet companies are valued we thought it would be better to give investors broader exposure to technology.\" The Global Technology Fund has lost about half its value over the past year, even though it was invested in \"conservative\" tech stocks. The Nasdaq composite has fallen by 42% over thesame period. The TechMark in London is down 44%. Merrill Lynch is far from the only investment house to see the value of its internet-related fund slump. Several internet funds run by smaller houses have been liquidated, and with an estimated 30 separate net funds remaining, analysts are predicting further write-offs. Perhaps the most famous internet investment fund disappointment in Britain has been Framlington's NetNet fund. By April it had lost 75% of its value and was rated one of the worst performing funds in the UK. Having raised \u00a360m from investors, plus a further \u00a340m in debt, it had less than \u00a38m in assets left last month.",

      "body": "<p>Why are theatre programmes so awful? I went to see Feelgood at the Garrick this week, and enjoyed it, though I resented paying \u00a33 for a programme which was packed with material I didn't want to read. Worst of all are the mini-biographies of the cast, which consist only of lists of the plays, films and TV shows they've appeared in. Who cares that they were once in Richard III at the Yelverton Festival, or that \"TV credits include Heartbeat and Kiss Thy Neighbour\"? They should tell you what you really want to know, and reflect the questions people are whispering to each other during the first act.</p> <p>\"Yes, she did play the wife of the abusive don in that Inspector Morse,\" it would read, \"you know, the one about the college servant who was pushed downstairs. And you might have seen her as the nosy neighbour in The Larkins Of Lark Rise. She also came on as a supply teacher on Grange Hill a few years ago, but if you blinked, you'd have missed her...\" Or, \"you're right, he's the bloke who always plays really bad-tempered old geezers, like Victor Meldrew only without the easy charm. He was in that sitcom, No Laughing Matter, but of course they ended it in mid-run it was so bad...\"</p> <p>Alternatively they should make the mini-biog into a proper profile. \"Susan Bastable is famous as one of the whiniest, most self-obsessed people in the profession. She never stops banging on about her four cats, and God, if she ever does get a part you never hear the end of it. I mean she was a nurse in Holby City recently, and if she was on the screen for more than six seconds I'd be surprised. Then she actually started boasting that she was inside the giant Twix costume in that chocolate ad, I actually had to leave the room I was giggling so much...\"</p> <p>Or, \"His camp manner conveniently conceals the fact that Cecil Transigent is one of the most notorious shaggers ever to walk into the Garrick Club. Not safe in taxis? He isn't safe in a crowded restaurant. Once a stage hand banged on his dressing room door and shouted: 'Twenty minutes, Mr Transigent!' and he replied, 'yes, not bad for a man of 62, eh?'\"</p> <p>I'd pay a fiver for that.</p> <p>\u0095 Do other cities have middle-class beggars? The other day I was in Mayfair, when a fairly smartly dressed woman came up. She had a proper handbag, and she wore old-fashioned glasses, giving her a studious look. When she approached I assumed she was a tourist. Then she said, in a well-modulated but neutral accent: \"Excuse me, would you mind giving me some money, so that I can buy something to eat?\" She gave me a polite little smile, much as if she'd just inquired the way to Green Park tube. I was so startled that I gave her 73p, which is what I had in change. It would be nice to report that I spotted her five minutes later heading into Claridge's restaurant, though I didn't, and I suppose she's no less likely to have spent it on drugs than those shaggy men under piles of grubby sleeping bags.</p> <p>Apparently the airhead - \"gosh, I'm so silly, I've just lost my car keys, and I can't get home, I could really kick myself, please could you let me have something towards a taxi?\" - is quite a common figure in the streets these days. That's a scam, but the woman I met was perfectly straightforward about what she wanted.</p> <p>\u0095 There's something quite biblical about the nation's recent afflictions. The great floods of last year and the pestilence on the land would both have been recognised as old friends by the Israelites and the Egyptians. Even the failures of the Dome and the new Wembley Stadium bring us echoes of those sacked and crumbling palaces, stone symbols of power dethroned.

      "bodyText": "Why are theatre programmes so awful? I went to see Feelgood at the Garrick this week, and enjoyed it, though I resented paying \u00a33 for a programme which was packed with material I didn't want to read. Worst of all are the mini-biographies of the cast, which consist only of lists of the plays, films and TV shows they've appeared in. Who cares that they were once in Richard III at the Yelverton Festival, or that \"TV credits include Heartbeat and Kiss Thy Neighbour\"? They should tell you what you really want to know, and reflect the questions people are whispering to each other during the first act. \"Yes, she did play the wife of the abusive don in that Inspector Morse,\" it would read, \"you know, the one about the college servant who was pushed downstairs. And you might have seen her as the nosy neighbour in The Larkins Of Lark Rise. She also came on as a supply teacher on Grange Hill a few years ago, but if you blinked, you'd have missed her...\" Or, \"you're right, he's the bloke who always plays really bad-tempered old geezers, like Victor Meldrew only without the easy charm. He was in that sitcom, No Laughing Matter, but of course they ended it in mid-run it was so bad...\" Alternatively they should make the mini-biog into a proper profile. \"Susan Bastable is famous as one of the whiniest, most self-obsessed people in the profession. She never stops banging on about her four cats, and God, if she ever does get a part you never hear the end of it. I mean she was a nurse in Holby City recently, and if she was on the screen for more than six seconds I'd be surprised. Then she actually started boasting that she was inside the giant Twix costume in that chocolate ad, I actually had to leave the room I was giggling so much...\" Or, \"His camp manner conveniently conceals the fact that Cecil Transigent is one of the most notorious shaggers ever to walk into the Garrick Club. Not safe in taxis? He isn't safe in a crowded restaurant. Once a stage hand banged on his dressing room door and shouted: 'Twenty minutes, Mr Transigent!' and he replied, 'yes, not bad for a man of 62, eh?'\" I'd pay a fiver for that. \u0095 Do other cities have middle-class beggars? The other day I was in Mayfair, when a fairly smartly dressed woman came up. She had a proper handbag, and she wore old-fashioned glasses, giving her a studious look. When she approached I assumed she was a tourist. Then she said, in a well-modulated but neutral accent: \"Excuse me, would you mind giving me some money, so that I can buy something to eat?\" She gave me a polite little smile, much as if she'd just inquired the way to Green Park tube. I was so startled that I gave her 73p, which is what I had in change. It would be nice to report that I spotted her five minutes later heading into Claridge's restaurant, though I didn't, and I suppose she's no less likely to have spent it on drugs than those shaggy men under piles of grubby sleeping bags. Apparently the airhead - \"gosh, I'm so silly, I've just lost my car keys, and I can't get home, I could really kick myself, please could you let me have something towards a taxi?\" - is quite a common figure in the streets these days. That's a scam, but the woman I met was perfectly straightforward about what she wanted. \u0095 There's something quite biblical about the nation's recent afflictions. The great floods of last year and the pestilence on the land would both have been recognised as old friends by the Israelites and the Egyptians. Even the failures of the Dome and the new Wembley Stadium bring us echoes of those sacked and crumbling palaces, stone symbols of power dethroned. Now the tabloids are obsessed by the vanishing British bosom. This started with Geri Halliwell losing weight and taking on the appearance, below the neck anyway, of a 12 year old boy. Then last week Denise Van Outen, the television star who has just joined the cast of Chicago, said that all the dancing and frolicking had reduced her once superb embonpoint to an A-cup.

Casey and Crozier have now shaken hands and made up, both pledging to work together for a new national stadium. Ahhhh! \"They eventually had a meeting of minds. They are both passionate Scotsmen who believe in what they are doing,\" said a source. The ministerial working group led by the home secretary Jack Straw, which is now examining the Wembley project, was also brought together a few months ago to prepare a report into next year's Commonwealth Games in Manchester. The report has now been completed and passed on to No10. According to those who have seen it, it paints a damning picture of financial irregularities in the organisation of the games and also points out a number of concerns that the 2002 Commonwealth Games might in fact be a financial flop. Manchester council has underwritten the event and the city's ratepayers may be asked to make up any shortfall in revenue. Tony Blair is currently digesting the report's contents and some harsh words are about to be said to the Manchester organising committee. Wembley, Dome, the Commonwealth Games . . . the list just grows and grows. Overheard 'They are still interested in moving to the Dome,' - a Greenwich council official claiming that Arsenal still want to move to south London . . . I Fought the Law and the Law Won (the Clash), Money, Money, Money (Abba), Money for Nothing (Dire Straits) and Taxman (the Beatles) - songs blaring over the sound system before Brighton's home game against Chesterfield on Tuesday night . . . 'I quite like going to Wembley' - home secretary Jack Straw. A case of perfect timing Ken Bates, once chair of Wembley National Stadium Ltd, ironically held a farewell dinner with his former staff on Tuesday, the day the project hit the buffers.",

The big increase in settlements over the last decade, often provocatively placed on hilltops overlooking Palestinian towns and villages, is one of the biggest causes of Palestinian hatred of Israelis. Draft copies of the former US senator George Mitchell's report have been handed to the Israelis and Palestinians for comment before a final version is published later this month. Mr Mitchell and his team have been deliberately even-handed in order to avoid fuelling high tensions. Palestinians blame the start of fighting on the visit by Ariel Sharon to the holy site known to Arabs as the Noble Sanctuary and to Israelis as Temple Mount. The report says the visit was not the direct cause but a contributing factor. There was more disappointment for the Palestinians when Mr Mitchell rejected their call for an international observer force to protect them from the Israeli army. In a further piece of juggling, the report calls for the Palestinians to stop firing at Israelis from civilian areas and urges Israelis to show restraint when returning fire to avoid excessive injuries to civilians. The Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said the document gave a \"firm and clear rejection of all settlement activity\". Although the Israeli government insists it has imposed a freeze on new settlements, it is encouraging the expansion of existing ones.

Florida's senate and house of representatives agreed a deal aimed at banning punch-card ballot machines and replacing them with optical scanning systems or touch-screen computers. \"I think it's worked out very well,\" said Jeb Bush, governor of the state and the president's brother. \"We're going to have a single standard for the state, high-quality machines, absentee ballot reform and recount standards that are clear and easy.\" Hanging, dimpled and pregnant chads - the pieces of cardboard that are meant to be removed to indicate a voter's preference - were a focal issue in the post-election weeks, as it became clear that thousands of votes had been discarded. About 180,000 ballots were set aside in Florida, either because of undervotes - no choice could be discerned - or overvotes, where more than one candidate was selected. Democrats complained that the new laws, allowing $24m (\u00a316.7m) for new machines and more to train poll workers, retain recounts by hand in the case of close elections. The Republican party fought against hand recounts in numerous court hearings. \"All the things we were attacked on before, like manual recounts, all of a sudden they are the biggest supporters,\" said Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \"If we had the manual recounts a year ago, Al Gore would be in the White House.\" But Kay Albowicz, communications director for the National Association of Secretaries of State, said: \"This would be one of the most comprehensive electoral reform packages that have been passed.\" Many bills have been drawn up to address reform in the six months since election day but only Georgia has put its plans into action before Florida, and the president's budget for next year includes no funds to tackle the issue.

      "bodyText": "Thousands more chicken products are being withdrawn from sale amid fears they contain meat that should only be used for pet food. Fourteen varieties manufactured by Perkins Frozen Foods were recalled yesterday following warnings from the government's food standards agency that they might be unfit for human consumption. They include Farmfoods chicken nuggets and chicken burgers, Nisa chicken steaks and chicken and mushroom pies, and other lines marked with \"best before\" dates of between June and November this year. The latest recalls mean that 29 product lines, including Shippam's and Sainsbury's spreads and two other Perkins products, have been withdrawn as the result of an investigation by Derbyshire police and food safety authorities into an alleged food scam which has so far involved the arrests of 19 people. Perkins said the alert had been raised after it received meat from Northampton-based MK Poultry. The police are investigating allegations that it bought condemned meat from the Derbyshire-based pet food processor Denby Poultry Products before selling it on. Denby's premises were raided in March and police are now sifting through computer files and paperwork, suggesting more recalls are possible. David Walker, spokesman for Perkins, said many of the products could have been eaten already, although it was highly unlikely people's health had been affected. The volume of products was \"relatively small\" although he could not put a value on them. \"This is a sweeping-up operation to be entirely sure. It is highly unlikely only a small proportion of those [products] listed could have contained any dubious raw material. We do not know precisely enough to be sure.\" Most of the lines would be sold by small shops, mostly in the north of England and in Scotland. Consumers should check their homes for such products, discard the contents and send the packaging to Perkins at PO Box 1386, Stoke-on-Trent ST4 8HX to obtain a refund. Supermarkets have promised to refund shoppers who return recalled products to stores. The food agency, which is considering new measures to make it more difficult for any scams, said: \"This is a precautionary measure, as it is unlikely that there would be any significant health risks from these products. But the agency advises against their consumption.\" The recalls coincide with news that the European commission is considering legal action against Britain over the way its food industry prepares 700m chickens a year for consumption. The commission's vets declared that the authorities had not done enough to bring improvements after their devastating report last year which criticised hygiene and supervision on poultry farms and in the plants that pack Britain's most popular meat, responsible for 40% of all meat sales. Action promised or taken by British agencies over poor lay-out of factories, separation of \"clean\" and \"dirty\" areas, unsatisfactory equipment, cleanliness and maintenance had \"without any doubt failed\". The inspection team delivered a similar verdict on the failure of the British authorities both to improve official veterinary supervision of farms, slaughterhouses and packing plants, and the checks made during the killing process by industry-appointed inspection assistants. But Britain's chief vet, Jim Scudamore, said \"certain areas of the existing meat hygiene rules are unrealistic and impractical\" and it was arguable whether others achieved high levels of public health protection. In a letter to the commission's health and consumer protection directorate, he said that proposals to change EU rules recognised this. The Ministry of Agriculture said attempts to improve documentation required for imports and exports of chicken had been delayed by the swine fever outbreak last autumn and then foot and mouth. \u0095 A list of the products recalled is available on www.foodstandards.gov.uk/",

      "bodyText": "Macedonia's latest crisis brought a flurry of diplomatic activity yesterday, with Nato and the EU deeply concerned that the country's fragile peace was blowing up in their faces and threatening wider Balkan instability. Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary-general, and Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy chief, fly to Skopje on Monday to urge the Macedonian government to combine tough military action against armed rebels with real political dialogue to defuse the resentments of ethnic Albanians. Mr Solana, consulting EU foreign ministers in Sweden over the weekend, will go on to the Kosovan capital, Pristina, to urge its Albanian leaders to restrain their Macedonian kinsmen. \"It's pretty alarming,\" one well-placed Brussels diplomat said last night, while Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, spoke of his \"great concern\". Diplomats said that K-For monitoring of the porous border between Kosovo and Albania had improved since the March crisis. Nato intelligence is now being passed to the Macedonian army. EU officials also welcomed this week's offer by President George Bush to increase US bilateral economic and military assistance. In northern Macedonia yesterday tanks rumbled over cobbled roads and helicopter gunships thundered overhead as government forces unleashed a fresh assault on ethnic Albanian rebels. There were unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties. Military officials, waging their largest offensive against the rebels since fighting subsided in late March, accused the insurgents of holding 3,500 people, mostly women and children, as \"human shields\" in the towns of Vaksince and Slupcane. A defence ministry spokesman, Gjorgji Trendafilov, said that \"all available means to eliminate terrorists\" would be used. He claimed that the army had inflicted \"serious damage\" on the rebels since the offensive began on Thursday after two of its soldiers were killed and a third abducted in a rebel ambush. Last weekend, eight members of an elite government unit were killed in another ambush. Yesterday, thick smoke billowed from rooftops, fields and forests on the outskirts of Vaksince, about 15 miles north of Skopje. An army spokesman said there were no civilian casualties, but media in Belgrade and Kosovo reported two civilians killed in the fighting in Vaksince, and the mayor of Lipkovo, Hysamedin Halili, said that at least seven people had been killed there. \"It is war,\" he said. \"The people are hiding in the basements. They are in the villages and they do not want to leave their houses.\" Western monitors accused soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation Army of operating inside Macedonia and demanded their immediate withdrawal. In a sign of how tensions have engulfed the former Yugoslav republic a hand grenade exploded in a Slav-owned cafe in central Skopje yesterday morning. The cafe was closed at the time and no one was injured, said an interior ministry spokesman. The rebels made no statements yesterday, a day after they called for a ceasefire and talks with President Boris Trajkovski on how to prevent bloodshed and \"maybe civil war\".",

Rising joblessness is likely to frighten US consumers, who are heavily in debt. Businesses have started cutting back on investment plans and on staff. If consumers rein in spending, the contractionary forces acting on the economy could result in a real recession not just a growth slowdown.",

He did not then see Britain as a 'foreign land' but was content to allow his fellow citizens to find their own paths to what limited happiness was on offer.</p> <p>The age of consent for homosexuals should be lowered to 16, he said, and gays should be allowed to marry. ('When they're not causing harm to other people, why should we object?') The single mothers his party had hounded in office should be cherished. ('It is better for a child to have one happy parent who cares and loves him or her than to have two and suffer from domestic violence.') Hague went to the Notting Hill Carnival in shorts and baseball cap and although he looked the saddest white rasta in town that day, his desire to show a faint solidarity with black Britons was worthy.</p> <p>Many of his followers were mortified. 'Why do I share a party with those who advocate sodomite marriage?' cried Norman Tebbit as his treacherous leader abandoned bigotry. Tim Montgomerie, the director of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, warned Hague that sleeping in the same bed as Ffion Jenkins before they had been united in Holy Matrimony violated 'the Christian ideal'. Only by remaining the guardian of the 'Judaeo-Christian' tradition, he added, could the leader 'attract many Christians and others of traditional belief into the activist-hungry Tory party'.</p> <p>Three years on, and Hague had undergone a conversion as profound as Constantine's. In a scene beyond satire, he addressed 8,000 ecstatic evangelicals who gathered to bother God in the Butlins camp at Minehead last year. His flirtation with homosexual rights was a schoolboy phase. He had, it transpired, been opposed to repealing Clause 28 long 'before the issue became newsworthy'. He went on to offer the righteous a deal. If they voted Conservative, he would allow religious broadcasters to catch the souls and money of viewers and listeners.

But you can't knock New Labour every week and I wrote about the Conservative Party's sinister links with the religious fundamentalists around the American Republicans. I would happily do so again, were it not for a press release dated 3 May from Janet Anderson, the Labour Broadcasting Minister. Representatives of every mainstream religion - Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh - had met her to discuss 'whether the restrictions on ownership of national broadcasting licences by religious bodies should now be relaxed due to the greater opportunities the digital age will offer,' she said.

Its editor, Dr Peter Brierley, admitted: 'All claims that Britain is a Christian nation will finally have to be given up.' Judaism is disappearing. Despite the relatively recent arrival of black Pentecostal churches, mosques and Hindu and Sikh temples, the British Social Attitudes Survey reports that the number of respondents saying they had no religion rose from 31 per cent in 1983 to 45 per cent in 1998.</p> <p>For all their unpopularity, the Government is more than happy for one third of schools to be controlled by religious organisations and only the National Secular Society complains about the humiliations which follow.</p> <p>Parents, it points out, debase themselves to get a child into a school which may be a few yards from their home and whose costs are paid for by their taxes.

It grounded all Liberian-registered aircraft and banned the import of all diamonds without proper certification. </p> <p>The security council authorised the sanctions on March 7 but delayed their implementation in a final attempt to get Liberia to stop the military and financial support that has allowed the RUF to wage a decade-long war against the Sierra Leone government. </p> <p>Since 1991 the RUF has terrorised Sierra Leone, killing and mutilating tens of thousands of civilians in a struggle aimed at controlling diamond fields. <br><b>AP, New York </b></p>",

Gen Aussaresses, who was head of undercover operations during the 1957 battle of Algiers, admitted in a book and newspaper interview this week that he and his men tortured and assassinated Algerians with - he said - the blessing of Paris. Mr Chirac stopped short of calling for a parliamentary inquiry, asking instead for historians to make it a priority to examine government and military archives from the period. But the justice minister, Marylise Lebranchu, favoured an inquiry into whether the remarks constituted \"an apologia for war crimes\". In his book, Services Speciaux Algerie 1955-57, Gen Aussaresses detailed acts of torture and cold-blooded executions. This week he told Le Monde: \"Torture is efficient, most people break and talk. After that, we'd finish them off. Does that trouble my conscience? I have to say it doesn't.\" Jon Henley, Paris EU refuses Polish delay on sales of land Poland suffered a setback in its bid to join the EU yesterday when Brussels rebuffed its call for a long delay before foreigners could buy land - a hyper-sensitive issue in the largest candidate country. With enlargement high on the agenda, the European commission called for a transitional period of up to seven years before citizens of the current 15 member states could buy farms in Poland and four other applicant countries. Poland, fearing a wave of purchases by Germans, especially in areas once inhabited by ethnic Germans, had demanded 18 years. \"That remains our position,\" a Polish spokesman said. \"This is an extremely sensitive issue.\" Polish land is between five and 10 times cheaper than across the border in Germany. The commission's move will add to pessimism in Warsaw about Poland's prospects of being in the first wave of new EU entrants. Although 54% of Poles believe that membership will benefit the existing members more than them, the government is under fire for falling behind other candidates in the race to join. The commission also wants a five-year delay on the purchase of second homes in Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic. Parts of Pomerania, Prussia and Silesia, German until 1945, are now in Poland. Ian Black, Brussels UN bans export of diamonds from Liberia The UN security council imposed sanctions against Liberia yesterday for failing to sever its ties with rebels in Sierra Leone. Britain's UN ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, said the sanctions would take effect from May 7 and would ban the import of diamonds from Liberia and travel by senior Liberian officials. On Wednesday, the secretary general, Kofi Annan, said the UN has received unconfirmed reports that Liberia was still supporting Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front rebels. \"We have got to bring peace to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea,\" said Mr Greenstock. \"We have a policy on that, that policy is to force the RUF to stop fighting.\" Liberia has said it was closing RUF offices, expelling all RUF members and freezing rebel assets. It grounded all Liberian-registered aircraft and banned the import of all diamonds without proper certification. The security council authorised the sanctions on March 7 but delayed their implementation in a final attempt to get Liberia to stop the military and financial support that has allowed the RUF to wage a decade-long war against the Sierra Leone government. Since 1991 the RUF has terrorised Sierra Leone, killing and mutilating tens of thousands of civilians in a struggle aimed at controlling diamond fields. AP, New York",

Releasing the results of new research, the English tourism council came close to saying that upbeat political assessments were verging on the dishonest with most footpaths still closed - although Snowdon, in north Wales, is re-opening this weekend - and many potential visitors still alarmed by upsetting images of mass destruction.

But Mr Golding's family believe he did not act decisively enough. \"I have spoken to the family and apologised on behalf of a very bigoted minority of residents,\" said Mr Grasby. \"As far as I'm concerned there was never any question that he would not be allowed here.\" Despite his apology the Goldings decided not to move their father into the \u00a3300 per week private home. He is now in temporary respite care, looking for somewhere else to live. Sawarn Malhotra, race equality officer for the Coventry race equality council, said the incident illustrated a wider problem in the provision of care for elderly people of non-white backgrounds. \"Service providers need to recognise the needs of diverse communities, and to be geared up to providing facilities that are genuinely multicultural,\" he said. \"Different facilities might be needed for people with specific religious, cultural or dietary needs. \"Social services need to look specifically at whether a home is suitable for all the minority communities living in the city. As a service provider there's more to being mulitcultural than simply not being racist.\" A spokeswoman for Coventry city council, which licenses the home, said it viewed the incident as \"totally unacceptable\". \"The owner of a home will sign a contract with us, part of which is to ensure that all people are treated equally. They need to tell racist residents in no uncertain terms that their behaviour will not be tolerated.\" Mr Golding's daughter Connie said: \"The council needs to look into why more black people aren't going into homes and whether, when they go into these places, they are made to feel welcome.\"",

Four years ago, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe produced a damning report on the massacres by Mugabe's army in Matabeland shortly after he came to power in 1980 - it was suppressed by the church. Individual priests have been beaten on opposition demonstrations, but their superiors failed to criticise the police for that abuse. Earlier this year, the Catholic church's Conference of Religious Superiors attacked the government in a series of newspaper advertisements. \"This is no longer a free country,\" they said. \"People live in abject fear of violence, crime and threats. The rule of law is no longer respected; terror and intimidation go unpunished.\" They emphasised the need for land redistribution, though not as it is being handled. \"Those who bear responsibility for the suffering of the people need to know that they will be held accountable for their actions.\" The Catholic church leadership belatedly offered a slap on the hand to Mugabe this week with a rebuke of political violence. But it failed to name either the president or his party in the pastoral letter.",

      "bodyText": "Denis Thorpe, the photographer who spent his entire Guardian working life in Manchester and escaped before the digital camera became king, once photographed LS Lowry and produced a classic portrait of a smiling artist holding one of his own works. The morning after Lowry died in February 1976, Thorpe talked his way past the security men to photograph the artist's home before its contents were cleared. It was an act of homage: Thorpe took pictures of the the artist's studio, his sitting room, the hall with battered raincoat and trilby on the pegs and the bedroom where Lowry kept his favourite pre-Raphaelite pictures. The photographs have become a priceless documentary record of part of the life of an artist who some critics love to hate but who retains a firm place in the hearts of those who hang his prints above their mantlepieces. Thorpe's photographs and reminiscences have been incorporated into a video which introduces a visit to the Lowry galleries in the new shining arts complex in Salford named after the artist. So it is fitting that an exhibition of Thorpe's work in Britain and Ireland should be staged at the Lowry. It was opened last night by the former Beirut hostage Brian Keenan, whom Thorpe photographed on the holy mountain of Croagh Patrick in Mayo, having chased round much of the Irish county to find him. It is the only picture in the exhibition which is in colour: a rainbow arches over Keenan's head in a portrait which speaks of courage, endurance and a kind of peace. Some of the earliest photographs, taken more than 50 years ago, are of Thorpe's parents at home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the town where he launched his career as a journalist: he began as a reporter but was seduced by pictures and was there to record the stricken faces at the Cresswell colliery disaster in 1950. Thorpe was back with the miners during the 1984-85 strike and caught both resignation and despair in the face of a man on his first shift the day the dispute ended. Many of us who worked with Thorpe will recognise old friends: Hebden Bridge, the most requested Guardian photograph ever, Ribblehead viaduct (we accused him of putting oily rags in the locomotive's firebox to get the smoke right over Ingleborough), and the juggler on the unicycle.",

Their mission was to fight the Japanese, at a time when the US was still at peace. Their presence heralded the birth of America's active military relationship with the Chinese nationalists; a tangled, contradictory involvement whose most recent manifestation has been the furore over US arms sales to nationalist Taiwan and the downing last month of the US Navy spy plane by the Chinese Communist government.

      "body": "<p>England's new super soccer stadium may, it appears, be built in some town or city other than London. Indeed, an optimist in the Guardian rated the chances of this occurring at eight out of 10. But I wonder. Siting prestige projects outside the capital is a notion often flirted with, but rarely accomplished. </p> <p>The Millennium Dome could, and probably should have gone to Birmingham, but cynical oldsters like me always knew that London would land it. The Wembley replacement might at the start have been allocated to Manchester, but we realists knew that London would win in the end. But what ought to happen is this: London should be disqualified. A site should be chosen which is close to a motorway, alongside a major rail route, no more than 25 miles from a principal airport, and accessible to Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool quite as much as to London. Milton Keynes has been mentioned, but they don't deserve to get it, having tried and, happily, failed to steal Wimbledon FC from south London. Though it might require some tinkering with the railway pattern to avoid supporters from Yorkshire and the north-east constantly having to change at Nuneaton, the appropriate place for this showpiece of English soccer is clearly Rugby. </p> <p><strong> As if it</strong> wasn't enough to make such a mess of the Townend/Taylor issue, the Conservatives have now recklessly thrown away both the whelk vote - so crucial in British elections - and the even bigger constituency of those who love, honour and cherish the traditional British cliche. This government, Ann Widdecombe charged this week in some context I now forget, could not even run a whelk firm. What she should have said was a whelk stall. Leaving aside the common complaint from owners of whelk stalls that running them isn't the doddle the world supposes, what sort of a politician is it who, where whelks are involved, thinks in terms of firms, not of stalls? Is Widders a closet corporatist? Or did she, I wonder, grow up in some distant land like Lithuania, where the sale of whelks is organised on more institutional lines? Do I discern behind all that bombast and bombazine a one-time asylum seeker? </p> <p> <strong>I knew </strong>my apology to Knaptoft for having confused it with Knapcroft would land me in further trouble, and sure enough, here is an email suggesting I may have meant to say Scraptoft, just east of Leicester. Well, maybe. But I think I shall stick with Knaptoft, for fear of offending another correspondent who has written in praise of the Knaptoft area, particularly for the place names clustered about it: Husbands Bosworth, for instance, and Stonton Wyville, Fleckney, Kibworth Beauchamp, Gumley, Peatling Parva and Willoughby Waterleys. On the other hand, Scrapcroft can boast its proximity to Barkby, Beeby and Carlton Curlieu, with a little further beyond Noseley, Glooston and Cranoe. I used in moments of desolation to chant to myself the healing mantra: \"Wressle, Howden, Eastrington, Gilberdyke, Broomfleet, Brough, Ferriby, Hessle, Hull\" - stations on the line from York through Selby and east to the coast. Yet I doubt that their music is any more noble than that of the stations which once punctuated the railway journey from Grantham to Leicester: \"Redmile for Belvoir, Harby &amp; Stathern, Long Clawson and Hose, Sealford, Melton Mowbray, Great Dalby, John O'Gaunt, Loseby, Ingersby, Thurnby &amp; Scraptoft, Humberstone, Leicester.\" They don't write tunes like that any more. </p> <p> <strong>The story so far: </strong>Clad in his habitual long clawson and thick woollen hose, Kibworth Beauchamp set out one dank afternoon in October on what, though he did not know it, was to be the last of his evening journeys across the autumnal fen to Peatling Parva, ancestral home of the Willoughby Waterleys. How gumley and beeby he felt, as the curlieus whirled through the fleckney sky and a raw east wind... </p> <p><strong> A Wellwisher (Wartnaby) writes: </strong> Have you any further news of the campaign to rehabilitate Harold Davidson, rector of Stiffkey? </p> <p> <strong>Smallweed fascinatingly responds: </strong> Yes indeedy. Further letters have now appeared in the Telegraph (of which Charles Moore is still editor, despite his having published a leader acclaiming William Hague's handling of the Townend-Taylor affair as \"splendid\".) Colin St Johnston of London NW1 claimed on Saturday that an inquiry agency, having trailed the rector for six months without success, persuaded a destitute woman to testify against him. She later swore an affidavit retracting her evidence, but this information was withheld from the consistory court which tried him. But Edward Lyall, of London SW1 submitted on Wednesday that Davidson's fall was due to his incurable addiction to the stage, on which he'd performed to acclaim in his youth. While at Stiffkey, he was only available for services at the weekends, spending the rest of his time in London looking for talent. </p> <p>He would walk into a Lyons Corner House and say to a pretty waitress: \"What is a lovely girl like you doing here? With your looks you should be on the stage.\" \"The prim, respectable Norfolk squires,\" Lyall sighs \"were determined to believe the worst of their absentee rector. Yet, like Mr Gladstone, he took his favoured ladies home to meet his wife.\" No doubt he did. But you do not need to be a prim, respectable squire to wonder if that is necessarily conclusive. </p> <p> <strong>It is now </strong>at least half a decade since Smallweed took up the cause of Cowdenbeath in the Scottish third division. Never in all that time has there been a more fraught or nervous occasion than there will be this afternoon, the last day of Cowdenbeath's season, as they take on Brechin City in an all-or-nothing encounter. Hamilton, until recently third, have only to beat Montrose, which they've done once already this week, to be promoted. The final place then would be between the teams which meet today. If Cowden win or draw, they go up. If they lose, and Hamilton win, they stay down. The tension is almost unbearable. Do go to Central Park and cheer them on if you can. I would do so myself, but I have to remain in London to investigate a serious case of lampricide, dammit.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" mrsmallweed@aol.com\">MrSmallweed@aol.com</a></p>",

The Wembley replacement might at the start have been allocated to Manchester, but we realists knew that London would win in the end. But what ought to happen is this: London should be disqualified. A site should be chosen which is close to a motorway, alongside a major rail route, no more than 25 miles from a principal airport, and accessible to Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool quite as much as to London. Milton Keynes has been mentioned, but they don't deserve to get it, having tried and, happily, failed to steal Wimbledon FC from south London. Though it might require some tinkering with the railway pattern to avoid supporters from Yorkshire and the north-east constantly having to change at Nuneaton, the appropriate place for this showpiece of English soccer is clearly Rugby. As if it wasn't enough to make such a mess of the Townend/Taylor issue, the Conservatives have now recklessly thrown away both the whelk vote - so crucial in British elections - and the even bigger constituency of those who love, honour and cherish the traditional British cliche. This government, Ann Widdecombe charged this week in some context I now forget, could not even run a whelk firm. What she should have said was a whelk stall. Leaving aside the common complaint from owners of whelk stalls that running them isn't the doddle the world supposes, what sort of a politician is it who, where whelks are involved, thinks in terms of firms, not of stalls? Is Widders a closet corporatist? Or did she, I wonder, grow up in some distant land like Lithuania, where the sale of whelks is organised on more institutional lines? Do I discern behind all that bombast and bombazine a one-time asylum seeker? I knew my apology to Knaptoft for having confused it with Knapcroft would land me in further trouble, and sure enough, here is an email suggesting I may have meant to say Scraptoft, just east of Leicester. Well, maybe. But I think I shall stick with Knaptoft, for fear of offending another correspondent who has written in praise of the Knaptoft area, particularly for the place names clustered about it: Husbands Bosworth, for instance, and Stonton Wyville, Fleckney, Kibworth Beauchamp, Gumley, Peatling Parva and Willoughby Waterleys. On the other hand, Scrapcroft can boast its proximity to Barkby, Beeby and Carlton Curlieu, with a little further beyond Noseley, Glooston and Cranoe. I used in moments of desolation to chant to myself the healing mantra: \"Wressle, Howden, Eastrington, Gilberdyke, Broomfleet, Brough, Ferriby, Hessle, Hull\" - stations on the line from York through Selby and east to the coast. Yet I doubt that their music is any more noble than that of the stations which once punctuated the railway journey from Grantham to Leicester: \"Redmile for Belvoir, Harby &amp; Stathern, Long Clawson and Hose, Sealford, Melton Mowbray, Great Dalby, John O'Gaunt, Loseby, Ingersby, Thurnby &amp; Scraptoft, Humberstone, Leicester.\" They don't write tunes like that any more. The story so far: Clad in his habitual long clawson and thick woollen hose, Kibworth Beauchamp set out one dank afternoon in October on what, though he did not know it, was to be the last of his evening journeys across the autumnal fen to Peatling Parva, ancestral home of the Willoughby Waterleys. How gumley and beeby he felt, as the curlieus whirled through the fleckney sky and a raw east wind... A Wellwisher (Wartnaby) writes: Have you any further news of the campaign to rehabilitate Harold Davidson, rector of Stiffkey? Smallweed fascinatingly responds: Yes indeedy. Further letters have now appeared in the Telegraph (of which Charles Moore is still editor, despite his having published a leader acclaiming William Hague's handling of the Townend-Taylor affair as \"splendid\".) Colin St Johnston of London NW1 claimed on Saturday that an inquiry agency, having trailed the rector for six months without success, persuaded a destitute woman to testify against him. She later swore an affidavit retracting her evidence, but this information was withheld from the consistory court which tried him. But Edward Lyall, of London SW1 submitted on Wednesday that Davidson's fall was due to his incurable addiction to the stage, on which he'd performed to acclaim in his youth. While at Stiffkey, he was only available for services at the weekends, spending the rest of his time in London looking for talent. He would walk into a Lyons Corner House and say to a pretty waitress: \"What is a lovely girl like you doing here? With your looks you should be on the stage.\" \"The prim, respectable Norfolk squires,\" Lyall sighs \"were determined to believe the worst of their absentee rector. Yet, like Mr Gladstone, he took his favoured ladies home to meet his wife.\" No doubt he did. But you do not need to be a prim, respectable squire to wonder if that is necessarily conclusive. It is now at least half a decade since Smallweed took up the cause of Cowdenbeath in the Scottish third division. Never in all that time has there been a more fraught or nervous occasion than there will be this afternoon, the last day of Cowdenbeath's season, as they take on Brechin City in an all-or-nothing encounter. Hamilton, until recently third, have only to beat Montrose, which they've done once already this week, to be promoted. The final place then would be between the teams which meet today. If Cowden win or draw, they go up. If they lose, and Hamilton win, they stay down. The tension is almost unbearable. Do go to Central Park and cheer them on if you can. I would do so myself, but I have to remain in London to investigate a serious case of lampricide, dammit. MrSmallweed@aol.com",

      "body": "<p> I have always believed myself fortunate to have come from a sprawling Indian family dominated by women. I have no brothers but plenty of sisters (three: believe me, that's plenty). My mother's sisters are a pair of aunts as formidable and irresistible as Bertie Wooster's Aunt Dahlia and Aunt Agatha. </p> <p> In my generation of cousins, girls outnumber boys by two to one. While I was growing up, the family's houses, in India and Pakistan, were full of the instructions, quarrels, laughter and ambitions of these women, few of whom resemble the stereotype of the demure, self-effacing Indian woman. These are opinionated, voluble, smart, funny, arm-waving persons - lawyers, educators, radicals, movers, shakers, matriarchs - and to be heard in their company you must not only raise your voice but also have something interesting to say. If you aren't worth listening to you will most certainly not be heard. </p> <p> As a result, I feel, to this day, most at home in the company of women. Among my close friends, the girls far outnumber the boys. In my writing, I have repeatedly sought to create female characters as rich and powerful as those I have known. The men in my books are rarely as flamboyant as the women. This is as it should be: or at least, in my experience, how it has been, more often than not. It is therefore disturbing, to say the least, that these women, or rather their potential successors in the Indian generation presently being conceived, are rapidly becoming an endangered species.</p> <p> In spite of the illegality of the practice - and under cover of spurious health checks - ultrasound tests to determine the gender of unborn children are increasingly being used all over India to identify, and then abort, obscene quantities of healthy female foetuses. The population is rapidly becoming lopsided, skewed towards male numerical dominance to a genuinely alarming degree. </p> <p> Here's a tough nut for the pro-choice lobby on abortion, of which I've always been a fully paid-up member. What should be done when a woman uses her power over her own body to discriminate against female foetuses? Many Indian commentators say that if these sex-discriminatory abortions are to end, the refusals must come from Indian women. But Indian women seem to want male children as much as their husbands do. In large part this is because of the myriad pressures of a man-centred society, including the expenses of the dowry system. But fundamentally it's the result of modern technology being placed at the service of medieval social attitudes.</p> <p> And clearly not all Indian women are as emancipated in thought and deed as those among whom I was lucky enough to be raised. Traditional India still exists, and its values are still powerful. Women beware women: an old story, given a chilling new gynaecological twist. Ever since Indira and Sanjay Gandhi's attempt to intro duce birth control by diktat during the forced-vasectomy excesses of the mid-70s, it has been very hard to get the Indian masses to accept the idea of family planning. Mother Teresa's hard-line attack on contraception didn't help.</p> <p> Lately, Hindu nationalists have made things even harder by suggesting that the country's Muslims are breeding faster than Hindus, thus placing Hinduism \"under threat\". (This, even though the Hindu majority makes up a whopping 85% of the population.) A bortion, along with contraception, has up to now been anathematised by Indian religious leaders. As a result, India's population has soared past the one billion mark, and is projected to overtake China's within a decade or so. But now, suddenly, terminations of pregnancies have become acceptable to many Indians, for the most reprehensible of reasons; and the argument over the urgent issues of popula tion control gets even murkier. </p> <p> There are those who claim that the new wave of abortions is actually beneficial, because the bias towards boys means that Indian couples who have girl children will tend to go on having daughters until they have a son, thus contributing to overpopulation. Allowing them to make the choice, the argument continues, will not result in a scarcity of girl children, but rather make sure there isn't a glut of them. The trouble with this theory is that the statistical evidence suggests that in a generation's time, there will indeed be a girl shortage. Then what? Will girls become more valued than they are today, or will the masculinism of Indian society, reinforced by the weight of numbers, simply create more and more macho men, and increasingly downtrodden women? </p> <p> Not all problems are capable of instant solution. Even though the nation imagines itself as a woman - Bharat Mata, Mother India - and even though, in Hinduism, the dynamic principle of the godhead - Shakti - is female, the scandal of the missing girls of India will only end when and if modern India succeeds in overturning centuries of prejudice against girl children. This doesn't mean that nothing can be done. The government can and should crack down hard on the ultrasound clinics that are allowing people to defy the law. It should provide state benefits for families with girl children and perhaps even, for a time, impose tax penalties on families with boys.</p> <p> Politicians, educators, activist groups and even newspaper columnists can and should batter away at the ingrained prejudices that are at the heart of the trouble.

      "bodyText": "I have always believed myself fortunate to have come from a sprawling Indian family dominated by women. I have no brothers but plenty of sisters (three: believe me, that's plenty). My mother's sisters are a pair of aunts as formidable and irresistible as Bertie Wooster's Aunt Dahlia and Aunt Agatha. In my generation of cousins, girls outnumber boys by two to one. While I was growing up, the family's houses, in India and Pakistan, were full of the instructions, quarrels, laughter and ambitions of these women, few of whom resemble the stereotype of the demure, self-effacing Indian woman. These are opinionated, voluble, smart, funny, arm-waving persons - lawyers, educators, radicals, movers, shakers, matriarchs - and to be heard in their company you must not only raise your voice but also have something interesting to say. If you aren't worth listening to you will most certainly not be heard. As a result, I feel, to this day, most at home in the company of women. Among my close friends, the girls far outnumber the boys. In my writing, I have repeatedly sought to create female characters as rich and powerful as those I have known. The men in my books are rarely as flamboyant as the women. This is as it should be: or at least, in my experience, how it has been, more often than not. It is therefore disturbing, to say the least, that these women, or rather their potential successors in the Indian generation presently being conceived, are rapidly becoming an endangered species. In spite of the illegality of the practice - and under cover of spurious health checks - ultrasound tests to determine the gender of unborn children are increasingly being used all over India to identify, and then abort, obscene quantities of healthy female foetuses. The population is rapidly becoming lopsided, skewed towards male numerical dominance to a genuinely alarming degree. Here's a tough nut for the pro-choice lobby on abortion, of which I've always been a fully paid-up member. What should be done when a woman uses her power over her own body to discriminate against female foetuses? Many Indian commentators say that if these sex-discriminatory abortions are to end, the refusals must come from Indian women. But Indian women seem to want male children as much as their husbands do. In large part this is because of the myriad pressures of a man-centred society, including the expenses of the dowry system. But fundamentally it's the result of modern technology being placed at the service of medieval social attitudes. And clearly not all Indian women are as emancipated in thought and deed as those among whom I was lucky enough to be raised. Traditional India still exists, and its values are still powerful. Women beware women: an old story, given a chilling new gynaecological twist. Ever since Indira and Sanjay Gandhi's attempt to intro duce birth control by diktat during the forced-vasectomy excesses of the mid-70s, it has been very hard to get the Indian masses to accept the idea of family planning. Mother Teresa's hard-line attack on contraception didn't help. Lately, Hindu nationalists have made things even harder by suggesting that the country's Muslims are breeding faster than Hindus, thus placing Hinduism \"under threat\". (This, even though the Hindu majority makes up a whopping 85% of the population.) A bortion, along with contraception, has up to now been anathematised by Indian religious leaders. As a result, India's population has soared past the one billion mark, and is projected to overtake China's within a decade or so. But now, suddenly, terminations of pregnancies have become acceptable to many Indians, for the most reprehensible of reasons; and the argument over the urgent issues of popula tion control gets even murkier. There are those who claim that the new wave of abortions is actually beneficial, because the bias towards boys means that Indian couples who have girl children will tend to go on having daughters until they have a son, thus contributing to overpopulation. Allowing them to make the choice, the argument continues, will not result in a scarcity of girl children, but rather make sure there isn't a glut of them. The trouble with this theory is that the statistical evidence suggests that in a generation's time, there will indeed be a girl shortage. Then what? Will girls become more valued than they are today, or will the masculinism of Indian society, reinforced by the weight of numbers, simply create more and more macho men, and increasingly downtrodden women? Not all problems are capable of instant solution. Even though the nation imagines itself as a woman - Bharat Mata, Mother India - and even though, in Hinduism, the dynamic principle of the godhead - Shakti - is female, the scandal of the missing girls of India will only end when and if modern India succeeds in overturning centuries of prejudice against girl children. This doesn't mean that nothing can be done. The government can and should crack down hard on the ultrasound clinics that are allowing people to defy the law. It should provide state benefits for families with girl children and perhaps even, for a time, impose tax penalties on families with boys. Politicians, educators, activist groups and even newspaper columnists can and should batter away at the ingrained prejudices that are at the heart of the trouble. In the end it all boils down to this: is today's India prepared to be seen as the country that gets rid of its daughters because it believes them inferior to men? The parents who are doing this may one day face questions from the children they allowed to live. \"Where are my sisters?\" What will they answer then?",

Two or three months ago when I had just finished reading Grayling' s recent biography of Hazlitt, The Quarrel of the Age, the Life and Times of William Hazlitt (Weidenfeld and Nicolson) I went to St Anne's churchyard, off Wardour Street, very close to Leicester Square, to look for the grave. I failed to find it but discovered it on a second visit.

Instead he bowed his head into the water, brought up a sparkling silver fish, jiggled it around and swallowed it. His breeding crest topped his triumph. Before leaving home I had watched a goldfinch, its red face glowing with spring, use the same movements to manoeuvre a dandelion seed down its throat. </p> <p>Further round the coastal path there was a rocky island where shags and cormorants gather to hang out their wings. But what was that strange bird next to one of the cormorants?

      "body": "<p>Mexico's greatest novelist is bemused, at 72, to find he can still cause a scandal. According to the Mexican labour minister, Carlos Abascal, Carlos Fuentes's gothic novella Aura, first published in 1962, is corrupting to young women. Ridiculous though many in the Mexican cabinet find the complaint, it led to a woman being sacked last month for teaching the book at the convent school attended by the minister's teenage daughter in Mexico City. </p> <p>\"Abascal objects to a scene in which a couple make love under a crucifix,\" Fuentes scoffs. \"But in Mexico most couples do that; there's always a crucifix above the bed. What's so shocking about that?\" Though incensed by the sacking, he and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez - a close friend and fellow resident of Mexico City, whose fiction was also impugned by Abascal - have found reason to gloat. Sales of the offending works have rocketed. \"I'm willing to cede 10% of my royalties to Minister Abascal,\" Fuentes grins to an audience in downtown Los Angeles. \"He's the best literary agent I've ever had.\" </p> <p>He is in California to give a reading which is billed as being in English. But Spanish inexorably takes over, despite weak protests from a handful of outnumbered anglophones. Though the multilingual author and one-time diplomat translates urbanely for the few monoglots, the scene illustrates one of his favoured themes: the Latino cultural \"reconquest\" of Mexican territory lost to the United States in the 19th century. His oeuvre of some 20 novels, short stories, plays, essays and journalism has probed not only the history and identity of Mexico, but its shifting relations with the superpower on its border. </p> <p>Fuentes was a leading figure - some would say the catalyst - of Latin America's literary \"boom\" of the 1960s and 70s, when its writers became popular both in neighbouring countries and in Europe and the US. Alongside the Colombian Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa, the Argentinian Julio Cort\u00e1zar and the Chilean Jos\u00e9 Donoso, Fuentes was one of the first Latin American authors who could live by their work. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Nobel Prize in 1982, Fuentes has said, marked the ascendancy of a whole region's literature. </p> <p>Fuentes was pivotal not only as an innovative novelist, but as a cosmopolitan who has spent his life on the move. The US writer William Styron, a close friend, sees him as \"uniquely well positioned\" to offer an \"extraordinary gift: an understanding of the relationship between the US and Mexico, and by inference, between Latin America and the rest of the world\". According to Jason Wilson, professor of Latin American studies at University College London, Fuentes has been a \"bridge between Mexico's view of itself and outsiders' views\", Mexicans having been hostile to such foreign portrayals as those of DH Lawrence or Graham Greene. </p> <p>Married since 1973 to his second wife, Sylvia Lemus, a television presenter in Mexico (\"She interviewed me, and has gone on interviewing me for 27 years\"), Fuentes spends about half the year in Mexico City and half in Europe, where they have a flat in Earls Court, London. For a month each year he is in the US, where he is \"professor-at-large\" at Brown University, Rhode Island. \"Our careers don't collide,\" he says. \"Wherever I go, Sylvia can follow, because she always finds someone to interview for her show.\" </p> <p>His globe-trotting and expansiveness have spawned public friendships with writers, film stars and politicians, from Bu\u00f1uel (with whom he collaborated) to Bill Clinton. He has remained close to Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Vargas Llosa (despite his two friends' mutual antagonism and opposing politics). He has also counted among his friends Norman Mailer, Shirley MacLaine, Arthur Miller, Philip Roth, Alberto Moravia, Milan Kundera, JK Galbraith and Claire Bloom. Critics of his autobiographical essays, Myself With Others (1988), resented what they saw as namedropping, while Angela Carter, who admired his novels, noted in them an \"inexplicable streak of vulgarity\". Yet Fuentes, who hails from a \"periphery\", has had the confidence to put his own country and culture on the map. </p> <p>His novel The Years with Laura D\u00edaz is published next week in English translation. It views episodes of Mexico's 20th-century history, with leaps to civil-war Spain and the McCarthyite US, as though in a panoramic mural by Diego Rivera. The artists Rivera and Frida Kahlo (for whose diaries Fuentes wrote a brilliant introduction in 1995) appear as characters in the novel, which Fuentes sees as a \"monument to the horrible 20th century, and to the place of my country and of Latin America in that world of strife, paradox and brutality\". </p> <p>In it he wrote of the death of a talented young artist, in part, he says, to ward off the illness of his and Sylvia Lemus's only son. (He has a daughter, Cecilia, by his first wife, the Mexican film star Rita Macedo, and another daughter, Natasha, with Lemus.) Born a haemophiliac, Carlos Fuentes Lemus died aged 25, three months after The Years with Laura D\u00edaz was published in Spanish in 1999. \"He knew his life would be short, so he worked a lot through the night, painting and drawing, writing poems. It's incredible the quantity of work he did in his short life.\" He published not only poems but photographs, and had exhibitions in Madrid and Barcelona. \"We became extremely close. I guided him into films and novels and poetry. He guided me to rock music, of which I knew nothing. He had a dry, more phlegmatic sense of humour than a Latin, exuberant way of being; he corrected some of my excesses. Without him, life has become very sad for me and my wife. But I feel that when I write is when I have my son close to me, almost inside me, as though we were writing and living together at those creative moments.\" </p> <p>Every book written is an act of exorcism, says Fuentes. \"But exorcism can turn to prophecy. All the evils of Mexico City I tried to exorcise in Christopher Unborn [1987] came true with a bonus: pollution, crime, corruption.\" Laura D\u00edaz's elder brother and son draw on Fuentes's own relatives. It is as though, he says, the novel is \"bracketed by the deaths of two people in my family: my uncle Carlos and my son Carlos\". </p> <p>Fuentes was born in 1928 to Mexican parents in Panama City. His mother, Berta, was watching a silent movie of La Boh\u00e8me when her waters broke. His diplomat father, Rafael, took his family across the Americas, from Quito to Montevideo, and later became Mexico's ambassador to Italy and Portugal. \"I had the good fortune of having a happy, closely knit family. In diplomatic service, you have to stay close because you're constantly changing countries, schools, friends, languages.\" </p> <p>Fuentes's uncle was a talented poet who died of typhoid aged 21. \"He left this legacy: my father named me after him and pushed me towards reading and writing as a homage to his brother. He guided me the way I did my son.\" </p> <p>He spent formative years, in 1934-40, in Washington DC, during the New Deal. \"That meant democratic values. I admired [Franklin D] Roosevelt as a great statesman. He solved the same problems of the depression, unemployment, the financial crash that gave rise to fascist dictatorships in Europe, but through democratic and humane means. I lived through that time in the US, and that put me squarely on the left ever since. It made me lament every time the US fell into reactionary policies, especially in Latin America.\" </p> <p>Although Fuentes lived outside Mexico until he was 16, he remembers a \"great sense of being Mexican\". At 10 he saw a film in Washington, Man of Conquest, about the US-Mexican wars. \"During the attack on the Alamo, I couldn't restrain my patriotism. I jumped on the seat, screaming, 'Viva Mexico - death to the gringo.'\" His father bundled him out of the cinema. That year, 1938, his popularity at school plummeted when President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas nationalised the oil wells. \"There were blazing headlines: 'Mexico steals our oil,' 'Communists take over American property.' Suddenly I became a dangerous 10-year-old red.\" </p> <p>Carlos and his younger sister, Berta, spent the summers with their grandmothers, \"keeping alive the Spanish language and hearing stories\". His father's ancestors had come to the Gulf state of Veracruz from the Canary Islands, and his paternal grandmother set up a boarding house in Mexico City. His mother's mother, a school inspector who campaigned for literacy in the 1920s, was the daughter of a German immigrant who founded a coffee plantation in Mexico. Fuentes calls The Years with Laura D\u00edaz a homage to these women. \"Contrary to the macho culture of Mexico, both my grandmothers were very brave young widows. I was always very close to these hard-working, intelligent women.\" </p> <p>The annual journey to Mexico was instructive in other ways. \"There were signs in Texas restaurants saying, 'No Mexicans or dogs allowed.' Waitresses would say, 'Stop talking that dirty lingo.' There was tremendous racism and prejudice against Mexicans - which there still is. All of this shaded my childhood and shaped my sense of Mexicanness.\" </p> <p>During the second world war, the family moved to a Chile \"governed by the Popular Front of communists and radicals. That was a revelation: that a Latin American country could have advanced social policies, and also great poets, like Pablo Neruda.\" He went to an English school in Santiago, but when they moved to Argentina in 1944, the schools in Buenos Aires were \"dominated by an anti-semitic, pro-Nazi minister. I said, 'I won't go.'\" His parents conceded. \"At age 15 I spent the most marvellous year, discovering [Jorge Luis] Borges, the tango and women. I owe the Argentine dictatorships at least three favours.\" </p> <p>Fuentes recalls the moment when he decided to become a writer. \"It was in Zurich, having dinner on the lake, when I saw Thomas Mann having dinner next to me. I was 21 years old.\" Although he studied international law in Geneva, Fuentes turned down a key job with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The man who took it, Miguel de la Madrid, later became Mexico's president, but Fuentes has no regrets. \"I knew I would have ended up with a life I didn't want. My life is the life of a writer.\" </p> <p>His first novel, Where the Air Is Clear (1958), broke ground in its urban portrayal of a metropolis in the making, harking back to the Mexico City of his childhood - famous, ironically, for its translucent air. The Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska saw then a \"sophisti cated and cosmopolitan young man, eager to prove that he owns the world\", while Jos\u00e9 Donoso was impressed by a Mexican who \"spoke perfect English. He had read every novel... and seen every painting and every movie in every capital of the world.\" </p> <p>While that novel prefigured the Latin American literary boom, Fuentes is anxious to share credit. \"The boom was a collective experience. We would not have existed without our forefathers.\" He cites the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, the Uruguayan Juan Carlos Onetti, the Guatemalan Miguel Angel Asturias and the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges. He also claims precedents in poets such as Neruda and the Peruvian C\u00e9sar Vallejo - \"great fashioners of language\". But his guiding lights were Cervantes (\"obviously\"), Faulkner and Balzac. \"Balzac travelled between documentary realism and stories of the fantastic with the greatest of ease. I've written ghost and fantastic stories, and others on society and politics. I don't feel any contradiction.\" </p> <p>Fuentes has been called \"the Balzac of Mexico\". But for Maarten van Delden, the author of Carlos Fuentes, Mexico and Modernity (1998), he is \"heir to the great European modernists - Joyce, Woolf, Proust. The Death of Artemio Cruz was one of the first Latin American novels to use stream of consciousness. But what he takes from them he applies to Mexican history and identity. Mexico is always his great subject.\" </p> <p>In The Death of Artemio Cruz (1962) a dying man looks back on the revolution with which he rose to power and wealth, but whose ideals were corrupted and betrayed. Fuentes calls himself a child of the Mexican revolution of 1910-20, which he sees as a political failure but a cultural watershed, a \"baptism\". The revolution, he says, \"promised many things and failed in many of them - democracy, human rights. But through it, Mexico saw itself as it really was; not as a fake, French facade with a Prussian-style army, but as an enormous country, extremely poor and illiterate, that had a rough and tough face - the face of an Emiliano Zapata and a Pancho Villa. Seeing yourself in a mirror is what the revolution was all about. From that sprang modern painting, music, poetry, film, novels.\" </p> <p>Mirroring Mexico meant unmasking it. \"Like all of Latin America, Mexico after independence in 1821 turned its back on a triple heritage: on the Spanish heritage, because we were newly liberated colonies, and on our Indian and black heritages, because we considered them backward and barbaric. We looked towards France, England and the US, to become progressive democratic republics.\" He adds: \"The Indian past was masked by the Spanish conquest. Then there was the European mask. Then we put on a North American mask, which we're still wearing.\" From \"Quetzalcoatl to Pepsicoatl\", as he once wrote. \"Maybe that's the real face of Mexico: masks one of top of another.\" </p> <p>His monumental novel Terra Nostra (1975) reclaimed a Spanish heritage for Latin America, but a plural one. He credits Borges with \"reminding us that Spain was also the repository of great Jewish and Muslim traditions throughout the middle ages\". In his non-fiction work The Buried Mirror (1992), and a BBC series of that name, Fuentes warned against using the quincentenary of Columbus's \"discovery\" of the Americas (also the subject of his novel Christopher Unborn) to castigate Spain. </p> <p>\"The conquest was catastrophic for the Indian peoples of the Americas,\" he says. \"But it wasn't sterile. We became mestizo nations, of mixed European and Indian blood, then black also: mulatto. We gained the gold of the Spanish language. And in Spanish America, even atheists are Catholics. So we are what we are because of the Iberian conquests, and I, for one, will not suffer the false Atlantic division. Neruda and Lorca are poets of the Spanish language; they belong to all - which is an advantage we have over English-speaking peoples.\" </p> <p>The Zapatista leader, Subcomandante Marcos, is known to admire Fuentes, who welcomed the 1994 uprising in Chiapas for reminding the country of its suppressed Indian self. \"For me, the problem is not the Zapatistas but the state of Chiapas; oligarchs owning and running and corrupting everything, protected by armed guards that go around murdering Indians,\" he says. </p> <p>In the 1950s, before he published his first novel and began to live by his writing, Fuentes had edited Mexican literary reviews while working for the ILO, the UN and the Mexican foreign ministry. In 1974 he became ambassador to Paris. But he resigned in 1977 over the appointment as Mexico's ambassador to Spain of former president Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, implicated in the Tlatelolco massacre of hundreds of protesting students in 1968, which overshadowed the Mexico Olympics. \"Mexico never recognised the Franco regime. But after 35 years of non-recognition, when Franco died we sent our own local Franco as ambassador,\" Fuentes fumes. In his view, the revolution \"came with a compact: governments said, 'We'll give you social reform but not democracy. We'll have a politi cal monopoly, the Institutional Revolutionary party, the PRI, to defend ourselves against the backlash of the church, dispossessed landowners and the gringos.' That compact lasted till 1968, when the real children of the revolution demanded the freedom, equality and revolutionary ideals in the streets. The result was murder, and from that moment the compact was broken.\" </p> <p>Jason Wilson, author of books on the Nobel Prize-winning poet Octavio Paz - who served as Mexico's ambassador to India - says Fuentes vied with Paz as the \"daring, outspoken Mexican intellectual\". Though the two had been friends since they met in Paris in 1950, they had a public falling-out in the late 1980s, when Paz's magazine, Vuelta, printed a vituperative attack on Fuentes's work. They never spoke again, creating a schism among their disciples that was unhealed at Paz's death in 1998. \"He never called me again; it was up to him to do it.\" </p> <p>According to Julio Ortega, professor of Hispanic studies at Brown University and co-editor with Fuentes of The Picador Book of Latin American Stories (1998), \"everybody in Mexico was waiting for Fuentes to fill the vacuum of power at the top of the cultural pyramid after Paz's death. But he's immune to the Mexican rituals of power. His politics are free of ideology or party lines. He sometimes overreacts, but always as an independent political voice with an instinct for social justice.\" </p> <p>Fuentes backed Castro's Cuban revolution of 1959, and the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua 20 years later. He found himself harassed by US officialdom. Invited by NBC in 1962 to debate with the Kennedy administration's undersecretary of state for Latin America, he was denied a visa. \"The pretext was that I was a card-carrying communist. I said it was untrue, 'But I'm going to become one thanks to your stupid policies - you're going to make communists of us all in Latin America.' \" He was barred from the US for much of the 1960s, till a ship he was on docked in Puerto Rico.</p> <p> \"This John Wayne character tore up my landing card, saying I was forbidden in American territory. I said, 'Puerto Rico isn't American, it's part of Latin America, so fuck yourself.'\" They reckoned without Fuentes's connections. He enlisted Vargas Llosa, Norman Mailer and American PEN, the writers' association, in a campaign, joined by Senator William Fulbright, to get him exempted from the list barring suspected communists (including Iris Murdoch, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Graham Greene, Dario Fo and Simone Signoret) from the US. Fuentes attacked US foreign policy, \"not in the back yard, but right here, in the front yard\" - the US.</p> <p> From the early 1970s he held a series of professorships at US universities. At the height of the US-backed Contra war in Nicaragua, he slammed the Reagan administration in a Harvard commencement speech in 1983. \"I said, 'You fools, you behave like Dr Jekyll at home and Mr Hyde in Latin America. You're making a big mistake.' \" Caspar Weinberger, Reagan's defence secretary, was in the front row. In 1987 Fuentes became Harvard's first Robert Kennedy professor of Latin American Studies. Of what he calls the \"United States of Amnesia\", he says: \"It's a country with a short memory. It has to be constantly reminded of its vices and virtues.\" </p> <p>Styron sees Fuentes as immensely influential among US scholars, with a \"purposely ambiguous approach to the US. Because he knows the culture so well, he neither panders to it, nor is he promiscuously critical. He's not an unqualified detractor like so many Latin American leftwing intellectuals.\" </p> <p>His novel The Old Gringo (1985), which became a film starring Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck, explored the US-Mexican border as a real and symbolic frontier. He returned to it in The Crystal Frontier (1995), a novel in nine stories in which Latinos cross the Rio Grande only to become invisible (terrain covered in Ken Loach's new film, Bread and Roses). Despite the brutal economic realities of a land frontier where the first world abuts the third, Fuentes relishes the \"silent reconquest\" of the Mexican territories lost in 1848. \"In the US, 35 million people speak Spanish,\" he says. \"Los Angeles is the second Spanish-speaking city in the world after Mexico City - and before Madrid or Buenos Aires. These people are bearers of culture.\" He believes the Latino presence will reshape US politics. \"The US has become a multicultural nation, which makes it stronger, not weaker - though it has difficulty accepting the fact.\" </p> <p>His novel Diana: The Goddess Who Hunts Alone (1994) forayed into autobiography with a thinly veiled portrait of Jean Seberg, the actress who committed suicide in 1979. Fuentes had met her at a New Year's Eve party in 1969, as his first marriage was breaking up. He and Seberg had a \"passionate location romance\". \"We went off together to the wilds of Durango where she was filming a tequila western,\" he says. \"She was brilliant, intelligent, beautiful - but I knew it would only last the time of the filming; she was married and had a son. She was a very hurt person; she'd been yanked out of the Lutheran midwest unprepared to cope with fame. I think it disturbed her emotionally. But I can only be grateful for those two months - very grateful.\" </p> <p>That and earlier portrayals of women in his novels have drawn feminist criticisms. One of Fuentes's translators, Margaret Sayers Peden, feels his work is steeped in a \"Latin culture in which women are whores or madonnas\". Alicia Borinsky, professor of Latin American literature at Boston University, views Fuentes as \"squarely in a tradition that places men at the centre of history\". Yet she adds: \"It wasn't a conspiracy of the boom writers but the cultural and social context.\" </p> <p>Fuentes has since praised a constellation of women writers in what he terms the \"boomerang\" generation that followed his own. He also wrote The Years with Laura D\u00edaz as a \"counterpoint\" to The Death of Artemio Cruz. \"I always felt a little worm inside me: 'Now you need to write a novel with a woman protagonist.' \" </p> <p>While Fuentes remains prolific, some feel he is repeating himself. Ilan Stavans, professor of Spanish studies at Amherst College, Massachusetts, says his \"early novels transformed Latin American literature; they mesmerised an entire readership with a new view of the novel and how to perceive Mexico through it. But he got stuck in a vision of history and literature that belongs to the 60s nouveau roman . He's a very fluid and dynamic man, but he's lost touch.\" </p> <p>Fuentes has champions, however, among a new generation of Latin American writers, the \"junior boom\", as he calls it, of the past three years. Born in 1968, the Mexican novelist Ignacio Padilla says: \"Fuentes is like our grandfather; he's the best example that you can be both local and universal, read both as a portrait of Mexico and as an epic of the world looking for its own identity.\" Fuentes sees President Vicente Fox Quesada, whose election last year ended 71 years of PRI rule, as \"a breath of fresh air. A new Mexican democracy is testing itself, warily but surely. The problems are daunting but a big step has been taken.\" Democracy is changing what he sees as the role of the Latin American intellectual in speaking for the voiceless. \"Civil society has grown stronger; there are cooperatives, the feminist movement, gay rights groups, a free press. So a writer may still speak out - but as a citizen.\" Yet, he says, responsibility remains. \"To maintain the vigour of language and the imagination - that's a role the writer cannot renounce.\" </p> <p> <strong> Life at a glance:</strong> Carlos Manuel Fuentes Mac\u00edas </p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> November 11 1928, Panama City. </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Schools in Washington DC and Santiago de Chile; Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Mexico City; Institute of Higher International Studies, Geneva. </p> <p><strong> Married:</strong> 1959-72 Rita Macedo (one daughter, Cecilia); 1973 Sylvia Lemus (one daughter, Natasha; one son, Carlos - deceased). </p> <p><strong> Career:</strong> 1954-58 editor, Revista Mexicana de Literatura; 1974-77 Mexican ambassador to France; 1986 Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar professor, Cambridge; 1987 Robert Kennedy professor, Harvard. </p> <p><strong> Some books:</strong> Where the Air is Clear, 1958; The Death of Artemio Cruz, 1962; Terra Nostra, 1975; The Old Gringo, 1985; Diana: The Goddess Who Hunts Alone, 1994; El Instinto de Inez, 2001. </p> <p><strong> Honours:</strong> 1984 Mexican national award for literature; 1987 Cervantes prize; 1992 L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. </p> <p>\u0095 The Years with Laura D\u00cdaz is published on Thursday by Bloomsbury at \u00a317.99.</p>",

Sales of the offending works have rocketed. \"I'm willing to cede 10% of my royalties to Minister Abascal,\" Fuentes grins to an audience in downtown Los Angeles. \"He's the best literary agent I've ever had.\" He is in California to give a reading which is billed as being in English. But Spanish inexorably takes over, despite weak protests from a handful of outnumbered anglophones. Though the multilingual author and one-time diplomat translates urbanely for the few monoglots, the scene illustrates one of his favoured themes: the Latino cultural \"reconquest\" of Mexican territory lost to the United States in the 19th century. His oeuvre of some 20 novels, short stories, plays, essays and journalism has probed not only the history and identity of Mexico, but its shifting relations with the superpower on its border. Fuentes was a leading figure - some would say the catalyst - of Latin America's literary \"boom\" of the 1960s and 70s, when its writers became popular both in neighbouring countries and in Europe and the US. Alongside the Colombian Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa, the Argentinian Julio Cort\u00e1zar and the Chilean Jos\u00e9 Donoso, Fuentes was one of the first Latin American authors who could live by their work. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Nobel Prize in 1982, Fuentes has said, marked the ascendancy of a whole region's literature. Fuentes was pivotal not only as an innovative novelist, but as a cosmopolitan who has spent his life on the move. The US writer William Styron, a close friend, sees him as \"uniquely well positioned\" to offer an \"extraordinary gift: an understanding of the relationship between the US and Mexico, and by inference, between Latin America and the rest of the world\". According to Jason Wilson, professor of Latin American studies at University College London, Fuentes has been a \"bridge between Mexico's view of itself and outsiders' views\", Mexicans having been hostile to such foreign portrayals as those of DH Lawrence or Graham Greene. Married since 1973 to his second wife, Sylvia Lemus, a television presenter in Mexico (\"She interviewed me, and has gone on interviewing me for 27 years\"), Fuentes spends about half the year in Mexico City and half in Europe, where they have a flat in Earls Court, London. For a month each year he is in the US, where he is \"professor-at-large\" at Brown University, Rhode Island. \"Our careers don't collide,\" he says. \"Wherever I go, Sylvia can follow, because she always finds someone to interview for her show.\" His globe-trotting and expansiveness have spawned public friendships with writers, film stars and politicians, from Bu\u00f1uel (with whom he collaborated) to Bill Clinton. He has remained close to Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Vargas Llosa (despite his two friends' mutual antagonism and opposing politics). He has also counted among his friends Norman Mailer, Shirley MacLaine, Arthur Miller, Philip Roth, Alberto Moravia, Milan Kundera, JK Galbraith and Claire Bloom. Critics of his autobiographical essays, Myself With Others (1988), resented what they saw as namedropping, while Angela Carter, who admired his novels, noted in them an \"inexplicable streak of vulgarity\". Yet Fuentes, who hails from a \"periphery\", has had the confidence to put his own country and culture on the map. His novel The Years with Laura D\u00edaz is published next week in English translation. It views episodes of Mexico's 20th-century history, with leaps to civil-war Spain and the McCarthyite US, as though in a panoramic mural by Diego Rivera. The artists Rivera and Frida Kahlo (for whose diaries Fuentes wrote a brilliant introduction in 1995) appear as characters in the novel, which Fuentes sees as a \"monument to the horrible 20th century, and to the place of my country and of Latin America in that world of strife, paradox and brutality\". In it he wrote of the death of a talented young artist, in part, he says, to ward off the illness of his and Sylvia Lemus's only son. (He has a daughter, Cecilia, by his first wife, the Mexican film star Rita Macedo, and another daughter, Natasha, with Lemus.) Born a haemophiliac, Carlos Fuentes Lemus died aged 25, three months after The Years with Laura D\u00edaz was published in Spanish in 1999. \"He knew his life would be short, so he worked a lot through the night, painting and drawing, writing poems. It's incredible the quantity of work he did in his short life.\" He published not only poems but photographs, and had exhibitions in Madrid and Barcelona. \"We became extremely close. I guided him into films and novels and poetry. He guided me to rock music, of which I knew nothing. He had a dry, more phlegmatic sense of humour than a Latin, exuberant way of being; he corrected some of my excesses. Without him, life has become very sad for me and my wife. But I feel that when I write is when I have my son close to me, almost inside me, as though we were writing and living together at those creative moments.\" Every book written is an act of exorcism, says Fuentes. \"But exorcism can turn to prophecy. All the evils of Mexico City I tried to exorcise in Christopher Unborn [1987] came true with a bonus: pollution, crime, corruption.\" Laura D\u00edaz's elder brother and son draw on Fuentes's own relatives. It is as though, he says, the novel is \"bracketed by the deaths of two people in my family: my uncle Carlos and my son Carlos\". Fuentes was born in 1928 to Mexican parents in Panama City. His mother, Berta, was watching a silent movie of La Boh\u00e8me when her waters broke. His diplomat father, Rafael, took his family across the Americas, from Quito to Montevideo, and later became Mexico's ambassador to Italy and Portugal. \"I had the good fortune of having a happy, closely knit family. In diplomatic service, you have to stay close because you're constantly changing countries, schools, friends, languages.\" Fuentes's uncle was a talented poet who died of typhoid aged 21. \"He left this legacy: my father named me after him and pushed me towards reading and writing as a homage to his brother. He guided me the way I did my son.\" He spent formative years, in 1934-40, in Washington DC, during the New Deal. \"That meant democratic values. I admired [Franklin D] Roosevelt as a great statesman. He solved the same problems of the depression, unemployment, the financial crash that gave rise to fascist dictatorships in Europe, but through democratic and humane means. I lived through that time in the US, and that put me squarely on the left ever since. It made me lament every time the US fell into reactionary policies, especially in Latin America.\" Although Fuentes lived outside Mexico until he was 16, he remembers a \"great sense of being Mexican\". At 10 he saw a film in Washington, Man of Conquest, about the US-Mexican wars. \"During the attack on the Alamo, I couldn't restrain my patriotism. I jumped on the seat, screaming, 'Viva Mexico - death to the gringo.'\" His father bundled him out of the cinema. That year, 1938, his popularity at school plummeted when President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas nationalised the oil wells. \"There were blazing headlines: 'Mexico steals our oil,' 'Communists take over American property.' Suddenly I became a dangerous 10-year-old red.\" Carlos and his younger sister, Berta, spent the summers with their grandmothers, \"keeping alive the Spanish language and hearing stories\". His father's ancestors had come to the Gulf state of Veracruz from the Canary Islands, and his paternal grandmother set up a boarding house in Mexico City. His mother's mother, a school inspector who campaigned for literacy in the 1920s, was the daughter of a German immigrant who founded a coffee plantation in Mexico. Fuentes calls The Years with Laura D\u00edaz a homage to these women. \"Contrary to the macho culture of Mexico, both my grandmothers were very brave young widows. I was always very close to these hard-working, intelligent women.\" The annual journey to Mexico was instructive in other ways. \"There were signs in Texas restaurants saying, 'No Mexicans or dogs allowed.' Waitresses would say, 'Stop talking that dirty lingo.' There was tremendous racism and prejudice against Mexicans - which there still is. All of this shaded my childhood and shaped my sense of Mexicanness.\" During the second world war, the family moved to a Chile \"governed by the Popular Front of communists and radicals. That was a revelation: that a Latin American country could have advanced social policies, and also great poets, like Pablo Neruda.\" He went to an English school in Santiago, but when they moved to Argentina in 1944, the schools in Buenos Aires were \"dominated by an anti-semitic, pro-Nazi minister. I said, 'I won't go.'\" His parents conceded. \"At age 15 I spent the most marvellous year, discovering [Jorge Luis] Borges, the tango and women. I owe the Argentine dictatorships at least three favours.\" Fuentes recalls the moment when he decided to become a writer. \"It was in Zurich, having dinner on the lake, when I saw Thomas Mann having dinner next to me. I was 21 years old.\" Although he studied international law in Geneva, Fuentes turned down a key job with the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The man who took it, Miguel de la Madrid, later became Mexico's president, but Fuentes has no regrets. \"I knew I would have ended up with a life I didn't want. My life is the life of a writer.\" His first novel, Where the Air Is Clear (1958), broke ground in its urban portrayal of a metropolis in the making, harking back to the Mexico City of his childhood - famous, ironically, for its translucent air. The Mexican writer Elena Poniatowska saw then a \"sophisti cated and cosmopolitan young man, eager to prove that he owns the world\", while Jos\u00e9 Donoso was impressed by a Mexican who \"spoke perfect English. He had read every novel... and seen every painting and every movie in every capital of the world.\" While that novel prefigured the Latin American literary boom, Fuentes is anxious to share credit. \"The boom was a collective experience. We would not have existed without our forefathers.\" He cites the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier, the Uruguayan Juan Carlos Onetti, the Guatemalan Miguel Angel Asturias and the Argentinian Jorge Luis Borges. He also claims precedents in poets such as Neruda and the Peruvian C\u00e9sar Vallejo - \"great fashioners of language\". But his guiding lights were Cervantes (\"obviously\"), Faulkner and Balzac. \"Balzac travelled between documentary realism and stories of the fantastic with the greatest of ease. I've written ghost and fantastic stories, and others on society and politics. I don't feel any contradiction.\" Fuentes has been called \"the Balzac of Mexico\". But for Maarten van Delden, the author of Carlos Fuentes, Mexico and Modernity (1998), he is \"heir to the great European modernists - Joyce, Woolf, Proust. The Death of Artemio Cruz was one of the first Latin American novels to use stream of consciousness. But what he takes from them he applies to Mexican history and identity. Mexico is always his great subject.\" In The Death of Artemio Cruz (1962) a dying man looks back on the revolution with which he rose to power and wealth, but whose ideals were corrupted and betrayed. Fuentes calls himself a child of the Mexican revolution of 1910-20, which he sees as a political failure but a cultural watershed, a \"baptism\". The revolution, he says, \"promised many things and failed in many of them - democracy, human rights. But through it, Mexico saw itself as it really was; not as a fake, French facade with a Prussian-style army, but as an enormous country, extremely poor and illiterate, that had a rough and tough face - the face of an Emiliano Zapata and a Pancho Villa. Seeing yourself in a mirror is what the revolution was all about. From that sprang modern painting, music, poetry, film, novels.\" Mirroring Mexico meant unmasking it. \"Like all of Latin America, Mexico after independence in 1821 turned its back on a triple heritage: on the Spanish heritage, because we were newly liberated colonies, and on our Indian and black heritages, because we considered them backward and barbaric. We looked towards France, England and the US, to become progressive democratic republics.\" He adds: \"The Indian past was masked by the Spanish conquest. Then there was the European mask. Then we put on a North American mask, which we're still wearing.\" From \"Quetzalcoatl to Pepsicoatl\", as he once wrote. \"Maybe that's the real face of Mexico: masks one of top of another.\" His monumental novel Terra Nostra (1975) reclaimed a Spanish heritage for Latin America, but a plural one. He credits Borges with \"reminding us that Spain was also the repository of great Jewish and Muslim traditions throughout the middle ages\". In his non-fiction work The Buried Mirror (1992), and a BBC series of that name, Fuentes warned against using the quincentenary of Columbus's \"discovery\" of the Americas (also the subject of his novel Christopher Unborn) to castigate Spain. \"The conquest was catastrophic for the Indian peoples of the Americas,\" he says. \"But it wasn't sterile. We became mestizo nations, of mixed European and Indian blood, then black also: mulatto. We gained the gold of the Spanish language. And in Spanish America, even atheists are Catholics. So we are what we are because of the Iberian conquests, and I, for one, will not suffer the false Atlantic division. Neruda and Lorca are poets of the Spanish language; they belong to all - which is an advantage we have over English-speaking peoples.\" The Zapatista leader, Subcomandante Marcos, is known to admire Fuentes, who welcomed the 1994 uprising in Chiapas for reminding the country of its suppressed Indian self. \"For me, the problem is not the Zapatistas but the state of Chiapas; oligarchs owning and running and corrupting everything, protected by armed guards that go around murdering Indians,\" he says. In the 1950s, before he published his first novel and began to live by his writing, Fuentes had edited Mexican literary reviews while working for the ILO, the UN and the Mexican foreign ministry. In 1974 he became ambassador to Paris. But he resigned in 1977 over the appointment as Mexico's ambassador to Spain of former president Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz, implicated in the Tlatelolco massacre of hundreds of protesting students in 1968, which overshadowed the Mexico Olympics. \"Mexico never recognised the Franco regime. But after 35 years of non-recognition, when Franco died we sent our own local Franco as ambassador,\" Fuentes fumes. In his view, the revolution \"came with a compact: governments said, 'We'll give you social reform but not democracy. We'll have a politi cal monopoly, the Institutional Revolutionary party, the PRI, to defend ourselves against the backlash of the church, dispossessed landowners and the gringos.' That compact lasted till 1968, when the real children of the revolution demanded the freedom, equality and revolutionary ideals in the streets. The result was murder, and from that moment the compact was broken.\" Jason Wilson, author of books on the Nobel Prize-winning poet Octavio Paz - who served as Mexico's ambassador to India - says Fuentes vied with Paz as the \"daring, outspoken Mexican intellectual\". Though the two had been friends since they met in Paris in 1950, they had a public falling-out in the late 1980s, when Paz's magazine, Vuelta, printed a vituperative attack on Fuentes's work. They never spoke again, creating a schism among their disciples that was unhealed at Paz's death in 1998. \"He never called me again; it was up to him to do it.\" According to Julio Ortega, professor of Hispanic studies at Brown University and co-editor with Fuentes of The Picador Book of Latin American Stories (1998), \"everybody in Mexico was waiting for Fuentes to fill the vacuum of power at the top of the cultural pyramid after Paz's death. But he's immune to the Mexican rituals of power. His politics are free of ideology or party lines. He sometimes overreacts, but always as an independent political voice with an instinct for social justice.\" Fuentes backed Castro's Cuban revolution of 1959, and the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua 20 years later. He found himself harassed by US officialdom. Invited by NBC in 1962 to debate with the Kennedy administration's undersecretary of state for Latin America, he was denied a visa. \"The pretext was that I was a card-carrying communist. I said it was untrue, 'But I'm going to become one thanks to your stupid policies - you're going to make communists of us all in Latin America.' \" He was barred from the US for much of the 1960s, till a ship he was on docked in Puerto Rico. \"This John Wayne character tore up my landing card, saying I was forbidden in American territory. I said, 'Puerto Rico isn't American, it's part of Latin America, so fuck yourself.'\" They reckoned without Fuentes's connections. He enlisted Vargas Llosa, Norman Mailer and American PEN, the writers' association, in a campaign, joined by Senator William Fulbright, to get him exempted from the list barring suspected communists (including Iris Murdoch, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Graham Greene, Dario Fo and Simone Signoret) from the US. Fuentes attacked US foreign policy, \"not in the back yard, but right here, in the front yard\" - the US. From the early 1970s he held a series of professorships at US universities. At the height of the US-backed Contra war in Nicaragua, he slammed the Reagan administration in a Harvard commencement speech in 1983. \"I said, 'You fools, you behave like Dr Jekyll at home and Mr Hyde in Latin America. You're making a big mistake.' \" Caspar Weinberger, Reagan's defence secretary, was in the front row. In 1987 Fuentes became Harvard's first Robert Kennedy professor of Latin American Studies. Of what he calls the \"United States of Amnesia\", he says: \"It's a country with a short memory. It has to be constantly reminded of its vices and virtues.\" Styron sees Fuentes as immensely influential among US scholars, with a \"purposely ambiguous approach to the US. Because he knows the culture so well, he neither panders to it, nor is he promiscuously critical. He's not an unqualified detractor like so many Latin American leftwing intellectuals.\" His novel The Old Gringo (1985), which became a film starring Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck, explored the US-Mexican border as a real and symbolic frontier. He returned to it in The Crystal Frontier (1995), a novel in nine stories in which Latinos cross the Rio Grande only to become invisible (terrain covered in Ken Loach's new film, Bread and Roses). Despite the brutal economic realities of a land frontier where the first world abuts the third, Fuentes relishes the \"silent reconquest\" of the Mexican territories lost in 1848. \"In the US, 35 million people speak Spanish,\" he says. \"Los Angeles is the second Spanish-speaking city in the world after Mexico City - and before Madrid or Buenos Aires. These people are bearers of culture.\" He believes the Latino presence will reshape US politics. \"The US has become a multicultural nation, which makes it stronger, not weaker - though it has difficulty accepting the fact.\" His novel Diana: The Goddess Who Hunts Alone (1994) forayed into autobiography with a thinly veiled portrait of Jean Seberg, the actress who committed suicide in 1979. Fuentes had met her at a New Year's Eve party in 1969, as his first marriage was breaking up. He and Seberg had a \"passionate location romance\". \"We went off together to the wilds of Durango where she was filming a tequila western,\" he says. \"She was brilliant, intelligent, beautiful - but I knew it would only last the time of the filming; she was married and had a son. She was a very hurt person; she'd been yanked out of the Lutheran midwest unprepared to cope with fame. I think it disturbed her emotionally. But I can only be grateful for those two months - very grateful.\" That and earlier portrayals of women in his novels have drawn feminist criticisms. One of Fuentes's translators, Margaret Sayers Peden, feels his work is steeped in a \"Latin culture in which women are whores or madonnas\". Alicia Borinsky, professor of Latin American literature at Boston University, views Fuentes as \"squarely in a tradition that places men at the centre of history\". Yet she adds: \"It wasn't a conspiracy of the boom writers but the cultural and social context.\" Fuentes has since praised a constellation of women writers in what he terms the \"boomerang\" generation that followed his own. He also wrote The Years with Laura D\u00edaz as a \"counterpoint\" to The Death of Artemio Cruz. \"I always felt a little worm inside me: 'Now you need to write a novel with a woman protagonist.' \" While Fuentes remains prolific, some feel he is repeating himself. Ilan Stavans, professor of Spanish studies at Amherst College, Massachusetts, says his \"early novels transformed Latin American literature; they mesmerised an entire readership with a new view of the novel and how to perceive Mexico through it. But he got stuck in a vision of history and literature that belongs to the 60s nouveau roman . He's a very fluid and dynamic man, but he's lost touch.\" Fuentes has champions, however, among a new generation of Latin American writers, the \"junior boom\", as he calls it, of the past three years. Born in 1968, the Mexican novelist Ignacio Padilla says: \"Fuentes is like our grandfather; he's the best example that you can be both local and universal, read both as a portrait of Mexico and as an epic of the world looking for its own identity.\" Fuentes sees President Vicente Fox Quesada, whose election last year ended 71 years of PRI rule, as \"a breath of fresh air. A new Mexican democracy is testing itself, warily but surely. The problems are daunting but a big step has been taken.\" Democracy is changing what he sees as the role of the Latin American intellectual in speaking for the voiceless. \"Civil society has grown stronger; there are cooperatives, the feminist movement, gay rights groups, a free press. So a writer may still speak out - but as a citizen.\" Yet, he says, responsibility remains. \"To maintain the vigour of language and the imagination - that's a role the writer cannot renounce.\" Life at a glance: Carlos Manuel Fuentes Mac\u00edas Born: November 11 1928, Panama City.

They appear only in spring, and really should be enjoyed in season, even if their price is similar to that of a great vintage Bordeaux wine.

By the end, the fridge contained little more than a lot of bits and bods, and out of the wreckage we came up with this union.

      "bodyText": "Spring, at last. Well, sort of, anyway. A sprightly tread replaces the slow, cowed movement of winter. And fresh and bright are those little bundles of small vegetables that require only a snip at their stalks and little more than a wipe and a rinse before cooking. The new-crop small potatoes are a particular pleasure - and how about the curious marvel that are morels, a mushroom prized higher than ceps in many quarters, including mine? They appear only in spring, and really should be enjoyed in season, even if their price is similar to that of a great vintage Bordeaux wine. They share few visual characteristics with our usual idea of a mushroom, what with their wide, hollow stalk and a cap that is long, slender, and deeply pitted all over, not unlike a knot of lace. Take great care in cleaning morels, as there is many a small nook in which small stones and the like can reside. Split them through lengthwise, and, if clean enough, go at them with a brush only or, if needs really must, a quick dunk in plenty of lightly salted water. If you take the latter approach, make sure they are completely dry before cooking. All recipes serve six. Mussels, clams and peas Come spring, there is a short, delightful period when the new-crop potatoes coincide with the end of the mussel season - they combine particularly well. A similar line of thought, albeit born out of sheer necessity, resulted in this mussel, clam and pea dish, which was fashioned out of thin air at the restaurant after an especially busy lunch that fair savaged our plans for the evening menu. By the end, the fridge contained little more than a lot of bits and bods, and out of the wreckage we came up with this union. And very good it is, too - so good, in fact, that it soon became a dish in its own right (as well as a very good accompaniment to steamed hake, which is how we served it that first time). Fresh peas must be cooked as soon after picking as possible, for the older they are, the more starch develops and the tougher and less sweet they become. Good-quality frozen petits-pois, which are frozen as near as dammit straight after harvest, make a pretty decent alternative. 1 kg mussels 1 kg clams 100ml white wine 4 shallots, chopped fine 500g peas, shelled 1 tbsp olive oil 10g unsalted butter 6 tbsp double cream 1 small handful fresh mint, chopped Remove the beards from the mussels and put them with the clams in a bucket under running cold water. Leave them for at least half an hour. In a great big pot, fry the shallots slowly in the oil and butter over a gentle heat. Bring a pan of lightly salted and sugared water (a big pinch of sugar helps bring out the natural sweetness in the peas) up to the boil, then tip in the peas, return to the boil and cook for five minutes or so, until softened. Remove from the heat, and leave the peas in the water - this will prevent any wrinkling. Drain the mussels and clams, and add to the shallot pot, along with the wine, and cover. Raise the heat and, stirring carefully now and then, cook until all the shells have opened. Discard any that do not. Now pour in the cream. Drain the peas and tip them into the pot. Add the chopped mint, mix together and serve piping hot.

After my house was pulled apart and put back together again by the insurance company, I got to choose new paint colours and - most exciting of all - tiles for the kitchen to replace those which the builder \"accidentally on purpose\" cracked with a large hammer. They had to be as low-priced as the old ones, but that didn't stop me going on a labyrinthine search to find the most beautiful and interesting tiles on offer. And somewhere along the line, I got hooked.</p> <p>Once you have tiles on the brain, the whole world seems divided into shining grids.

When multiplied and combined with others, it becomes a work of art. Nothing beats a tile for quality and intensity of colour which, when splattered with dirt or toothpaste, needs just a quick wipe or a shower of rain to restore it to its original lustre.</p> <p>My long (and somewhat obsessive) tile odyssey took me way beyond the local DIY superstore. There's a whole market in old tiles at reclamation and architectural salvage yards, car-boot sales and tile dealers (yes, they exist!). Tiles which are more than about 80 years old are classed as antiques, and can change hands for hundreds of pounds (perhaps it's a bit rash to stick these ones up behind a sink).</p> <p>But how about a tile made the traditional way? James, from a small, one-off tile shop near my house, proudly shows me a Moroccan tile in matt casbah blue which is still made the traditional way from gypsum and sand. Tiny marks on the back of each tile show where they have been leant up against the wall to dry in the sun. He shows me another Moroccan tile in which the pattern is made with something like cookie moulds. \"Look at the light bleeding of the colours into each other,\" he gushes.</p> <p>It is these slight imperfections which make them so desirable: each one is unique. You can find modern tiles still made the traditional way in most of the specialist tile shops all over the country. Hand-painted tiles from Seville, with pictures of birds and flowers, or Dutch tiles with pictures of soldiers and horsemen, have not changed much in the last couple of hundred years and can still be bought either in their country of origin or in specialist shops in this country.</p> <p>What if you want something contemporary? The ancient art of tile-making has definitely entered the 21st century. One of the most popular new techniques is to bubble \"oxygenated\" glass tiles in pale aqua, turquoise or glacier blue. Their cool, watery colours would look fresh and minty in any bathroom, but might be too toothpastey for your average kitchen. The newest blue translucent glass tiles by Avanti (large at 20cm x 20cm) are wonderful as a single object, but would need a large space not to seem claustrophobic en masse.</p> <p>Another cutting-edge newcomer is the uncompromisingly modern \"live\" tile in blue or grey: they're silvery, but they also seem to move with the light, almost like a hologram. Because such innovative tiles tend to dominate any interior, ask to view them over a wide surface area (most tile shops have boards showing how the tiles will look together). Metal tiles will fit in any where, particularly if you want a shiny futuristic look to go with your Smeg oven. Or, for a more radical look, how about Jenni Redstone's tiles covered in graffiti (graffiti is definitely this year's fashion)? To do this, Redstone takes pictures of the graffiti, before computer manipulating the photos and heat pressing the designs on to the tiles.</p> <p>Dotting the odd expensive tile among cheaper ones is a good way not only of keeping the price down but also stopping a Delft, Mexican or Victorian pattern becoming overwhelming. But it can look odd to intersperse more contemporary tiles with plain white ones: they're too particular to chuck in with something else. The ever-popular mosaic, though, can be mixed in to make lines and edges for the more ordinary tile. Artist Sarah Horrillo uses a combination of mosaic and smashed tiles in her large ceramic compositions for fireplaces, bathrooms and kitchens. She has recently completed a series of large panels for a pub, representing large flower forms. \"I like the different textures that the combination of ceramic tiles and glass mosaic gives me,\" she says. \"I also enjoy smashing a plain tile up and making it into something beautiful and interesting.\" She goes straight to the main importer of Italian mosaic, Udny Edgar &amp; Co, in south London, the mecca to all mosaic makers.</p> <p>Tile designer Lubna Chowdhary also uses old tiles in her work, cutting plain ones into oblongs to contrast with her own exquisite handmade tiles. Chowdhary works on a commission basis, designing and installing her whole composition, rather then selling individual tiles. Each surface is different and she is constantly experimenting with texture and colour, firing a tile a number of times to gain the rich and varied effect that makes her work so memorable.</p> <p>\"People always comment that because of the bright colours and circular shapes my inspiration must be from nature, but actually I used to follow my dad around and help him with the DIY,\" she says. \"I enjoy taking things apart and putting them together again. Rather than the sun and flow ers, it's more likely to be the inside of a transistor radio that's in my head while I work.\"</p> <p>By contrast, Dominic Crinson often exploits the shapes and forms of natural objects, using the hi-tech method of digitally processing images on to ready-made tiles: fruits sliced through the middle, gorgeous flowers, a close up of the purple whirls inside a red cabbage, the sensuous forms of a woman's breast or the curve of a shell. He is coy about the technicalities of achieving such intensity of colour, only saying that the image is \"impregnated on to the surface of the tiles\". He will even transfer a customer's chosen image on to tiles on request. Unfortunately my insurance budget meant that I had to look elsewhere.</p> <p>I found some beautiful - and cheap - tiles at my local trade decorating centre, among the beige and floral dross. One friend had advised me to buy plain, white tiles and get my kids to decorate a few with tile paint, but in the end I went for crackle tiles of blue and turquoise green, their surface fired at high temperatures in an Italian factory to create that broken-glaze effect.

      "body": "<p>In 1757, William Hogarth painted an image of a dog urinating on a stack of old master paintings. Sadly, this flamboyant piece of art criticism - originally part of Hogarth Painting The Comic Muse - never saw the light of day. Whether he got cold feet or simply changed his mind, the artist buried the cock-legged canine under several layers of paint.</p> <p>That many of Hogarth's paintings featured dogs is no anomaly. If it's true that the first two loves of British art are the portrait and the landscape, the third is surely the pet. \"I had rather see a portrait of a dog I know,\" observed Samuel Johnson, \"than all the allegories you can show me.\" The appeal of dogs and cats in art has been two-fold. Their presence adds a tone of naturalness to human portraits, as well as telling us about their owners - or even, in Hogarth's case, speaking for them.</p> <p>The European origin of pets as vehicles of information can be traced to Jan van Eyck's brilliant Arnolfini Marriage (1434), which depicts a freshly wedded couple posing in their new home. Eager and pale, the young wife bunches her dress around her belly. She may be indicating lust, or perhaps an impatient desire to conceive. Her faithfulness is not in question - the lapdog at the hem of her dress is a standard symbol of a woman's conjugal fidelity.</p> <p>In Nicolas de Largilli\u00e8re's 1695 portrait of James II's children, meanwhile, the exiled monarch's daughter is paired with a similarly faithful pooch. Her brother's majestic greyhound carries its own message; as Byron would later write of his own dog, James's hound conveys \"strength without insolence . . . all the virtues of man without his vices\". Posed over a vine of morning glory - symbolising the faith of the English people - the regal greyhound is James's alter ego, embodying his claim to the throne.</p> <p>Ironically, when Elizabeth I posed for an equally symbol-laden portrait more than half way through her reign, she was portrayed not with a large dog emblematic of her status but with the very same type of lapdog seen in the Arnolfini Marriage. \"I will make a faithful wife,\" the 52-year-old monarch wryly promises her political suitors, none of whom she has the slightest intention of marrying.</p> <p>When the Virgin Queen was crowned, her supporters stuffed cats into straw effigies of the Pope and burned them alive in celebration. By the 19th century, however, the long-standing European belief that cats were linked to witchcraft and evil - and were thus fair game for such tortures - had abated, and the feline form began appearing alongside women in portraits.

Even in France, where cats became favourite subjects of both Renoir and Picasso, artists felt that cats were somehow too emasculating to be paired with men.

      "bodyText": "In 1757, William Hogarth painted an image of a dog urinating on a stack of old master paintings. Sadly, this flamboyant piece of art criticism - originally part of Hogarth Painting The Comic Muse - never saw the light of day. Whether he got cold feet or simply changed his mind, the artist buried the cock-legged canine under several layers of paint. That many of Hogarth's paintings featured dogs is no anomaly. If it's true that the first two loves of British art are the portrait and the landscape, the third is surely the pet. \"I had rather see a portrait of a dog I know,\" observed Samuel Johnson, \"than all the allegories you can show me.\" The appeal of dogs and cats in art has been two-fold. Their presence adds a tone of naturalness to human portraits, as well as telling us about their owners - or even, in Hogarth's case, speaking for them. The European origin of pets as vehicles of information can be traced to Jan van Eyck's brilliant Arnolfini Marriage (1434), which depicts a freshly wedded couple posing in their new home. Eager and pale, the young wife bunches her dress around her belly. She may be indicating lust, or perhaps an impatient desire to conceive. Her faithfulness is not in question - the lapdog at the hem of her dress is a standard symbol of a woman's conjugal fidelity. In Nicolas de Largilli\u00e8re's 1695 portrait of James II's children, meanwhile, the exiled monarch's daughter is paired with a similarly faithful pooch. Her brother's majestic greyhound carries its own message; as Byron would later write of his own dog, James's hound conveys \"strength without insolence . . . all the virtues of man without his vices\". Posed over a vine of morning glory - symbolising the faith of the English people - the regal greyhound is James's alter ego, embodying his claim to the throne. Ironically, when Elizabeth I posed for an equally symbol-laden portrait more than half way through her reign, she was portrayed not with a large dog emblematic of her status but with the very same type of lapdog seen in the Arnolfini Marriage. \"I will make a faithful wife,\" the 52-year-old monarch wryly promises her political suitors, none of whom she has the slightest intention of marrying. When the Virgin Queen was crowned, her supporters stuffed cats into straw effigies of the Pope and burned them alive in celebration. By the 19th century, however, the long-standing European belief that cats were linked to witchcraft and evil - and were thus fair game for such tortures - had abated, and the feline form began appearing alongside women in portraits. But it never appeared with men, who continued posing with large dogs - even when those dogs didn't actually exist.

Such 'damage' is not necessarily bad, as it may be a stimulus for muscle growth, but too much 'damage' is harmful. Wait at least 24 hours before working the affected area again. Also, remember a day a week should be total rest from training. \u0095 Chris St George is fitness director of The Third Space, London, 020-7439 7333.

Jonathan Beckett Nottingham Zoe Williams is right to spike pernicious non-words (Words That Should Be Banned, April 28), but: \"Realpolitik\" is a German word meaning \"doing dodgy deals with your political opponents\", such as the pact between Hitler and Stalin to carve up Poland, so, far from being a non-word, it has a very precise meaning. As for \"Real Madrid\", Zoe makes a mistake typical of monolingual English speakers: \"Real\" is the Spanish for \"royal\". Julia Iskandar London NW11 Zoe Williams, writing of the Real IRA, breezily declares that what irks her about them is that they're not \"real\" enough: \"Real IRAs blow up proper buildings, not post offices.\" Are 29 men, women and children enough for you?

      "body": "<p>Helmut Newton is holding out a gun for my inspection. \"It's a Beretta!\" he says, brightly. That this tanned, octo-genarian, in his smart-but-casual, v-necked C\u00f4te d'Azur attire, should be armed with a pistol seems a little surprising. Perhaps it shouldn't be. Being professionally \"dangerous\" has been Newton's thing ever since the 60s, when his fashion photography brought nudity and overtly sexual imagery on to the glossy pages of French Vogue and Germany's Stern. His pictures are known for their cold, voyeuristic mood, and even now they have the power to shock. </p> <p>Yet Newton's longevity - and his legendary status - point to something more. His photography is beautiful, powerful and disturbing too. The portraits are elegant and coldly revealing, and the fashion photography - unfurling, inexplicable dramas depicted in night-time settings and peopled by sleek, Amazonian women - have for decades been consistent in their vividness and vision. But they are not always easy to understand; they're unsettling and chilling. </p> <p>Newton himself, bright-eyed and craggy-faced, is altogether affable as he directs me to the \"boss's chair\" in his office overlooking the bay of Monte Carlo. He and his wife June (also a photographer - her professional name is Alice Springs) have lived in an apartment adjoining the office for the past 20 years. The climate is good for his health (he has a heart condition) and, in the winter months, they follow the sun to Los Angeles. The exhibition, Helmut Newton: Work, to be shown later this month at the Barbican, London, has been curated by June and, Newton is keen to point out, is most definitely not a retrospective. \"That's something you do when you're dead. I think that's depressing. I can't think of anything more boring than walking into an exhibition and seeing the same old shit! Without evolution, things look sad. But, on the other hand, you can't get out of your skin, there is a certain, I won't say vision, but point of view that is always with me. My wife said, 'When you look at your pictures, you cannot deny your past.' \" </p> <p>He concedes that the decadence that so famously permeated 30s Berlin left its mark on his young psyche. Newton was born there in 1920, and was 12 when he first tried photography, with a Box Brownie. First, he tried some night-time shots on the darkened Berlin underground, but they didn't come out. Next, he shot, successfully, the city's Radio Tower (\"a mini Eiffel Tower\") in daylight. As a child, his mother would take him to tea dances at grand hotels, which he loved. Soon, he started to take pictures of his mother and his girlfriends, and before long it was accepted that he would not be going to work in his father's button factory. </p> <p>In 1936, he was apprenticed to Yva, a society photographer. He loves the night-time photography of Brassa\u00ef - the two became friends a few years before the latter died - and says he's influenced by him still. Another inspiration is the work of the Berlin doc umentary photographer Erich Salomon, who died in Auschwitz. Trials, political conferences and embassy soir\u00e9es were Salomon's specialities, often shot in dark light and amid imposing architecture. A sense of intense but unexplained drama permeated his work - as it does Newton's. </p> <p>Being Jewish, the teenage Helmut and his parents fled Germany in 1938, his parents to South America and he to Singapore, where he worked for a very brief spell as a news photographer - \"I was thrown out after two weeks 'cause I was no bloody good, ha ha!\" - then, for a while, he had a portrait studio. From there he went to Australia, served in the Australian army as a truck driver, and worked as a fashion photographer in Melbourne, before returning to Europe in 1957. Does he still feel German? \"Of course I don't!\" he exclaims, clearly affronted. \"I like Berlin, but that's a different matter.\" Does he feel Jewish? \"I'm what they call a bad Jew.\" He hasn't set foot in a synagogue since he was a schoolboy. </p> <p>There's certainly a feel of 30s Berlin (or at least our perception of it) in his scenes of darkened decadence. There's also a black wit. You get the feeling with much of his fashion photography that he is mocking the very notion of fashion, or the vanity and artifice of it. In his elaborate and elegant mise en sc\u00e8nes, always shot on location rather than in the studio, there is invariably a sly subversion - often a reminder of real life. Two models in ultra-glamorous evening wear pose languidly at a public swimming pool as sunbathers look on. A model - gorgeous, but also faintly absurd-looking - runs down the street in her underwear past bemused onlookers, or tears along an aeroplane runway, apparently pursued by a low-flying plane. </p> <p>The \"X-Ray\" series of pictures are darkly witty, too - though Newton claims that they're not meant to amuse; he wanted to see what was going on \"under the flesh\" and took some of his models, draped in millions of dollars-worth of Van Cleef and Arpels jewellery, to a radiologist. The jewels disappeared, leaving only the skulls and the metal settings. He re-visited the technique in 1994, with an x-ray shot of a foot in ankle-chain and stiletto shoe (he fetishises high heels) that is particularly macabre, but also beautiful. The picture of a model's hands, also from 1994, bejewelled with Bulgari diamonds and dismembering a chicken outraged the jewellery company, which threatened to withdraw its advertising from French Vogue as a result. </p> <p>Of course, it's not just fragile fashion industry sensibilities that Newton has offended, and he certainly gives his critics plenty of ammunition. Since the 70s, when he blazed the trail of \"porno-chic\", his more extreme pictures - women clad in no more than high heels and suspenders and some or other riding accoutrement - made him one of the photographic world's few brand names. His outrageous 1976 picture of a model kneeling on a bed with a Herm\u00e8s saddle on her back enraged many women. He says it was meant as a playful subversion: \"You see so many images of women riding men.\" (One wonders what kind of magazines he reads.) Nowadays, his comic nihilism has become the prevailing mood in fashion photography, and his once-extremist vision of decadent luxury and cruel chic - and, of course, the exposure of bare flesh - have emerged as the norm: Newton anticipated the current climate in fashion of wealth, sex and excess by decades. </p> <p>So it's perhaps no surprise that he has been blamed by his detractors for taking fashion photography to the edge of pornography, from whence, they believe, it has never truly returned. Even as recently as the mid-90s, an exhibition of his was spattered with paint by protesters. Certainly, his photography is a matter of taste, and some of his more extreme, fetishistic images are, to many of us, just plain nasty. In fact, he's happy not to be liked by everyone, though flamboyantly exasperated by those who believe that his work is demeaning to women. To me, the woman-in-saddle shot is funny in its absurdity but, equally, I can see why it might be regarded as offensive. He gets rather cross when I say so. \"It's bullshit!\" he says. \"As far as I can tell, and women friends have told me, the feminist movement has evolved into something more serious.\" He audaciously counts himself as a feminist: \"I'm against this ghetto that women are put in, often by themselves, 'women photographers', 'women artists', what counts is the work.\" </p> <p>\"Triumphant,\" is how he describes the women in his work, and he disagrees that he often makes them look absurd or objectified. It's certainly true, however, that the men who appear in many of his mini-narratives are in servile roles - waiters, chauffeurs or aged, frail-looking sugar daddies. In Newton's 1999 \"Miami\" shot, for example, a nondescript, barely visible man looks on from the shadows at the main attraction, a peroxide blonde in bikini and mirrored shades who is sprawled on a table in exhibitionist mode. Women, on the whole, are menacing, dangerous, frequently exhibitionist femmes fatales. Dangerous is a word he likes. In his portraiture as well as in his fashion work, he sometimes says to his subjects - Luciano Pavarotti, for instance - \"look dangerous\". </p> <p>In Helmut's world, things are either \"interesting\" or \"boring\" - it's as simple as that. Recently, one of the major galleries in the US - \"I'm not saying which one\" - refused his work on the grounds that it might be detrimental to its future funding. Newton says that he finds Americans to be obsessed with such judgments. \"It's boring, boring, boring! As I get older, I hope to get more and more politically incorrect!\" He seems to relish his agent provocateur status (he's giving a talk to coincide with the Barbican show, introduced by Alexander McQueen: \"Now he's a true agent provocateur\"). And if everyone found his work acceptable, there would be no boundaries to transgress, surely? \"Exactly! If you can do whatever you want, where's the fun? Because forbidden things are more interesting.\" </p> <p>These days, he says, there are so many explicit images in magazines or on the catwalk that \"sometimes, when I see all those nipples being bared and all those bottoms, I think, 'My God! I don't want to go to dinner with a lady dressed like that!' I don't understand it.\" Demureness is not his thing, surely? \"No. A woman who is a shrinking wallflower, who is not intelligent and strong and self-assertive, is uninteresting - to put it mildly. I have a lot of male friends who prefer having bimbos at dinner than interesting women, but not me. But a woman can be extremely sexual without showing everything.\" </p> <p>So, he likes dominant women? \"I like strong women! A domineering woman, like a macho man, is boring.\" Yves Saint Laurent's designs signify to him everything he wants a woman to be: \"Elegant, desirable, sensual, very classy, very expensive-looking.\" (He often places his models in bourgeois settings - grand hotels, genteel arrondisements.) \"But I never wanted my ladies to be ladylike,\" he adds. \"I wanted them to look like they are somewhat available, given the right situation and the right conditions.\" </p> <p>Paparazzi photography is another obsession of Newton's - he even shot some fashion photographs alongside the paparazzi in Rome in the 70s, when they were still a new and strictly Roman phenomenon. These days, however, he considers the French to be masters of the craft: \"And some of their exploits I admire greatly, very much to the surprise and dismay of certain people I know.\" Yes, there is a cruelty there, he agrees - and if he were a movie star he would probably feel differently - but he respects their tenacity and technical prowess. He particularly loves the famous shots of Jackie Onassis sunbathing nude on the island of Skorpios. He has often used pseudo-paparazzi scenes in his fashion work, another enduring influence on current fashion photography. \"When it's bad, it's dumb, but when it's good, it's amazing.\" </p> <p>For all the elaborately fake fantasies that Newton sets up in his pictures, his work is closer to documentary style than much current fashion photography. He \"takes a picture\", but he doesn't \"work on it\", or re-touch it, and so, as far as he's concerned, he's just \"a real old-fashioned photographer\". For this reason, Newton has always dismissed the label of \"artist\". \"What is on the film is what appears on the photographic paper.\" Sometimes, society ladies whom he meets at dinner ask him to do their portraits. \"I say to them, 'You wouldn't like what I do.'\" </p> <p>And that is the strength of Newton's portrait work - his cold, uncompromising eye. Yet, interestingly, celebrities still queue up to be snapped by him. He likes to photograph \"the famous and, especially, the infamous\". Sigourney Weaver posed for him in a wet, transparent shirt. Anthony Hopkins stares intently into the lens, every crease in his face laid bare. Leni Riefenstahl, the Nazi photographer, powders her extraordinarily lined features (Newton has never been apologetic about his admiration for her work, despite the obvious criticism such a stance has provoked). Princess Caroline of Monaco with tiara and a dog on a lead: \"I think royals can be as boring as everyone else, but they can also be pretty wild people.\" </p> <p>Most of his subjects are happy with the result - though not Jean-Marie Le Pen. Newton persuaded France's far-right leader to pose with two dobermans, and Le Monde published the picture alongside a shot of Hitler with his own two Alsatians. Le Pen hadn't wanted to pose with the dogs, and though Newton says he usually doesn't make his subjects do something they don't want to do - \"All they have to do is say no\" - this time he persisted. </p> <p>Catherine Deneuve, too, took a few years to get used to a Newton portrait of her. \"She was very professional, quite cold, very beautiful.\" He is the only photographer she has allowed into her apartment, he says, and at the time she was horrified by the resulting shots - seductive, in lingerie, cigarette clenched between her teeth. \"She wants to be very ladylike, and an ambassador for France and so on.\" But then, a few years later, he says, she had a change of heart and loved the images. And, yes, he says, he would love to photograph Camilla Parker-Bowles: \"It's something to do with power - she's an interesting woman.\" </p> <p>Power and sex. Sex and power. How sex makes you powerful. These are the Newton obsessions. He hates the word \"love\", thinks it's overused (like the word \"erotic\", which he also hates). And there's certainly no trace of tenderness in his pictures. \"No, you're quite right, they're very cold and calculating.\" </p> <p>At home, however, there is always June. They've been married for 40 years, and have no children. She is also his collaborator. She has not only curated his recent shows, but has art directed many of his books. He loves strong women, as he's said (June is reputed to be rather fierce), so is that what attracted him to her? Not really, he says, it was more because she was the first actress he had ever met. \"I thought that was quite a gas.\" He liked the idea of the changing persona of an actress, the artifice of it. Although that wasn't quite what he got, he adds. </p> <p>They joined forces on a book Us And Them, which is \"all about our personal lives\" - the portrait of Newton in jaunty hat and high-heeled slingbacks, taken in Monte Carlo by his wife in 1987, is from this series. So, is she a big influence on his work? \"Of course she's an influence, but often we don't agree and when I feel very strongly about something I'll do it, anyway.\" Would he say he's a romantic person? \"I'm romantic about funny things, but in my pictures I reject it.\" And in real life? \"My wife and I get on tremendously well, and that, I guess, is love, true love, going on between two people. I think romance is cute . . .\" he trails off. \"But I don't want it in my pictures,\" he says firmly. \"And whether I'm romantic or not is nobody's business.\" </p> <p>His private life is very different from his professional life, he says. \"If I was to live like the people in my photos, I'd be dead a long time ago. I lead a very quiet life. But my pictures are very personal, truly personal.\" </p> <p>Raquel Welch once commented, \"Here you are, thinking Helmut is this little sweetie pie, this little honeybun, and here he has this perverse lens trained on you. There was such a paradox.\" And she's right: Newton is not at all cold and creepy, as you might expect. In fact, he's very good-humoured and amiable. But what about the pistol on his desk? He says it's to indulge his Philip Marlowe fantasies, and \"It's for people like you! Ha ha! British journalists.\" His wife has said that he puts all of the cruelty into his work, and that in real life he's a complete pussycat. </p> <p>Cold voyeurism can be something more than it seems, of course - and a camera can be as much a shield as a weapon; behind a camera, a photographer can be detached. He tells me that when June was in hospital a few years back, recovering from a serious operation, he was very upset, and he went in to see her in hospital and took pictures of her, baring her scar. He's very squeamish, even faints at the sight of blood, and says this was the only way he could deal with it. </p> <p>He'll keep at it, he says, because he loves taking pictures. But since he's a \"street and beach\" photographer rather than a studio photographer, that will depend on his health, which at the moment, \"touch wood\", is good, despite a little arthritis. For some of his more recent pictures, his assistant has had to help him clamber over the Monte Carlo rocks - they're landscapes, moonlight on the sea, that kind of thing. \"Quite romantic, I suppose,\" he says, a bit shiftily.</p> <p>\u0095 Helmut Newton: Work in Progress is at the Barbican Gallery, May 10-July 8, 020 7638 8891.

He gets rather cross when I say so. \"It's bullshit!\" he says. \"As far as I can tell, and women friends have told me, the feminist movement has evolved into something more serious.\" He audaciously counts himself as a feminist: \"I'm against this ghetto that women are put in, often by themselves, 'women photographers', 'women artists', what counts is the work.\" \"Triumphant,\" is how he describes the women in his work, and he disagrees that he often makes them look absurd or objectified. It's certainly true, however, that the men who appear in many of his mini-narratives are in servile roles - waiters, chauffeurs or aged, frail-looking sugar daddies. In Newton's 1999 \"Miami\" shot, for example, a nondescript, barely visible man looks on from the shadows at the main attraction, a peroxide blonde in bikini and mirrored shades who is sprawled on a table in exhibitionist mode. Women, on the whole, are menacing, dangerous, frequently exhibitionist femmes fatales. Dangerous is a word he likes. In his portraiture as well as in his fashion work, he sometimes says to his subjects - Luciano Pavarotti, for instance - \"look dangerous\". In Helmut's world, things are either \"interesting\" or \"boring\" - it's as simple as that. Recently, one of the major galleries in the US - \"I'm not saying which one\" - refused his work on the grounds that it might be detrimental to its future funding. Newton says that he finds Americans to be obsessed with such judgments. \"It's boring, boring, boring! As I get older, I hope to get more and more politically incorrect!\" He seems to relish his agent provocateur status (he's giving a talk to coincide with the Barbican show, introduced by Alexander McQueen: \"Now he's a true agent provocateur\"). And if everyone found his work acceptable, there would be no boundaries to transgress, surely? \"Exactly! If you can do whatever you want, where's the fun? Because forbidden things are more interesting.\" These days, he says, there are so many explicit images in magazines or on the catwalk that \"sometimes, when I see all those nipples being bared and all those bottoms, I think, 'My God! I don't want to go to dinner with a lady dressed like that!' I don't understand it.\" Demureness is not his thing, surely? \"No. A woman who is a shrinking wallflower, who is not intelligent and strong and self-assertive, is uninteresting - to put it mildly. I have a lot of male friends who prefer having bimbos at dinner than interesting women, but not me. But a woman can be extremely sexual without showing everything.\" So, he likes dominant women? \"I like strong women! A domineering woman, like a macho man, is boring.\" Yves Saint Laurent's designs signify to him everything he wants a woman to be: \"Elegant, desirable, sensual, very classy, very expensive-looking.\" (He often places his models in bourgeois settings - grand hotels, genteel arrondisements.) \"But I never wanted my ladies to be ladylike,\" he adds. \"I wanted them to look like they are somewhat available, given the right situation and the right conditions.\" Paparazzi photography is another obsession of Newton's - he even shot some fashion photographs alongside the paparazzi in Rome in the 70s, when they were still a new and strictly Roman phenomenon. These days, however, he considers the French to be masters of the craft: \"And some of their exploits I admire greatly, very much to the surprise and dismay of certain people I know.\" Yes, there is a cruelty there, he agrees - and if he were a movie star he would probably feel differently - but he respects their tenacity and technical prowess. He particularly loves the famous shots of Jackie Onassis sunbathing nude on the island of Skorpios. He has often used pseudo-paparazzi scenes in his fashion work, another enduring influence on current fashion photography. \"When it's bad, it's dumb, but when it's good, it's amazing.\" For all the elaborately fake fantasies that Newton sets up in his pictures, his work is closer to documentary style than much current fashion photography. He \"takes a picture\", but he doesn't \"work on it\", or re-touch it, and so, as far as he's concerned, he's just \"a real old-fashioned photographer\". For this reason, Newton has always dismissed the label of \"artist\". \"What is on the film is what appears on the photographic paper.\" Sometimes, society ladies whom he meets at dinner ask him to do their portraits. \"I say to them, 'You wouldn't like what I do.'\" And that is the strength of Newton's portrait work - his cold, uncompromising eye. Yet, interestingly, celebrities still queue up to be snapped by him. He likes to photograph \"the famous and, especially, the infamous\". Sigourney Weaver posed for him in a wet, transparent shirt. Anthony Hopkins stares intently into the lens, every crease in his face laid bare. Leni Riefenstahl, the Nazi photographer, powders her extraordinarily lined features (Newton has never been apologetic about his admiration for her work, despite the obvious criticism such a stance has provoked). Princess Caroline of Monaco with tiara and a dog on a lead: \"I think royals can be as boring as everyone else, but they can also be pretty wild people.\" Most of his subjects are happy with the result - though not Jean-Marie Le Pen. Newton persuaded France's far-right leader to pose with two dobermans, and Le Monde published the picture alongside a shot of Hitler with his own two Alsatians. Le Pen hadn't wanted to pose with the dogs, and though Newton says he usually doesn't make his subjects do something they don't want to do - \"All they have to do is say no\" - this time he persisted. Catherine Deneuve, too, took a few years to get used to a Newton portrait of her. \"She was very professional, quite cold, very beautiful.\" He is the only photographer she has allowed into her apartment, he says, and at the time she was horrified by the resulting shots - seductive, in lingerie, cigarette clenched between her teeth. \"She wants to be very ladylike, and an ambassador for France and so on.\" But then, a few years later, he says, she had a change of heart and loved the images. And, yes, he says, he would love to photograph Camilla Parker-Bowles: \"It's something to do with power - she's an interesting woman.\" Power and sex. Sex and power. How sex makes you powerful. These are the Newton obsessions. He hates the word \"love\", thinks it's overused (like the word \"erotic\", which he also hates). And there's certainly no trace of tenderness in his pictures. \"No, you're quite right, they're very cold and calculating.\" At home, however, there is always June. They've been married for 40 years, and have no children. She is also his collaborator. She has not only curated his recent shows, but has art directed many of his books. He loves strong women, as he's said (June is reputed to be rather fierce), so is that what attracted him to her? Not really, he says, it was more because she was the first actress he had ever met. \"I thought that was quite a gas.\" He liked the idea of the changing persona of an actress, the artifice of it. Although that wasn't quite what he got, he adds. They joined forces on a book Us And Them, which is \"all about our personal lives\" - the portrait of Newton in jaunty hat and high-heeled slingbacks, taken in Monte Carlo by his wife in 1987, is from this series. So, is she a big influence on his work? \"Of course she's an influence, but often we don't agree and when I feel very strongly about something I'll do it, anyway.\" Would he say he's a romantic person? \"I'm romantic about funny things, but in my pictures I reject it.\" And in real life? \"My wife and I get on tremendously well, and that, I guess, is love, true love, going on between two people. I think romance is cute . . .\" he trails off. \"But I don't want it in my pictures,\" he says firmly. \"And whether I'm romantic or not is nobody's business.\" His private life is very different from his professional life, he says. \"If I was to live like the people in my photos, I'd be dead a long time ago. I lead a very quiet life. But my pictures are very personal, truly personal.\" Raquel Welch once commented, \"Here you are, thinking Helmut is this little sweetie pie, this little honeybun, and here he has this perverse lens trained on you. There was such a paradox.\" And she's right: Newton is not at all cold and creepy, as you might expect. In fact, he's very good-humoured and amiable. But what about the pistol on his desk? He says it's to indulge his Philip Marlowe fantasies, and \"It's for people like you! Ha ha! British journalists.\" His wife has said that he puts all of the cruelty into his work, and that in real life he's a complete pussycat. Cold voyeurism can be something more than it seems, of course - and a camera can be as much a shield as a weapon; behind a camera, a photographer can be detached. He tells me that when June was in hospital a few years back, recovering from a serious operation, he was very upset, and he went in to see her in hospital and took pictures of her, baring her scar. He's very squeamish, even faints at the sight of blood, and says this was the only way he could deal with it. He'll keep at it, he says, because he loves taking pictures. But since he's a \"street and beach\" photographer rather than a studio photographer, that will depend on his health, which at the moment, \"touch wood\", is good, despite a little arthritis. For some of his more recent pictures, his assistant has had to help him clamber over the Monte Carlo rocks - they're landscapes, moonlight on the sea, that kind of thing. \"Quite romantic, I suppose,\" he says, a bit shiftily. \u0095 Helmut Newton: Work in Progress is at the Barbican Gallery, May 10-July 8, 020 7638 8891.

And, to round things off this week, Simply Sauvignon Vin de Pays d'Oc 2000 (15 points, Tesco) is one huge slurp of impishly fresh, tangy fruitiness. What's more, you need just \u00a32.99 to get it past the checkout. \u0095 For the latest wine news, and to email Malcolm Gluck, visit superplonk.com",
