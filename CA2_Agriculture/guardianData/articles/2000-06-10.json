      "body": "<p><strong>Holland:</strong> van der Sar, Reiziger, Stam, F. de Boer, Zenden, Seedorf, Cocu, Davids, Kluivert, Bergkamp, van Bronckhorst. <br> Substitutes: Bosvelt, Konterman, Makaay, Numan, Overmars, Westerveld, Winter, R. de Boer, de Goey, van Vossen, van Hooijdonk. <br></p> <p><strong>Czech Republic:</strong> Srnicek, Repka, Latal, Nedved, Nemec, Poborsky, Koller, Rosicky, Smicer, Rada, Gabriel. <br>Substitutes: Bejbl, Blazek, Fukal, Horvath, Jankulovski, Kuka, Lokvenc, Maier, Novotny, Vlcek. <br></p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Perluigi Collina (Italy) <br></p> <p>No Overmars for the co-hosts - Zenden takes his place. Big noise greeted the Dutch to their first game in Euro 2000. The home side are understandably hot favourites tonight, but the Czechs are no mugs.</p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> The Czechs start the match with the 19 year-old Rosicky dropped well and truly in at the deep end, due to Patrik Berger's suspension. Will he sink or swim?<br><strong>3</strong> Early doors, but the Czechs do not appear overawed and seem content to let the Dutch do their pretty passing thing with one eye on the quick counter.<br><strong>6</strong> Davids is sandwiched between Repka and Latal in the Czech area, and tries to look as aggrieved as you can in orange shades. The hairless Collina remains unmoved.<br><strong>7</strong> Davids in his shades again. The midfielder breaks from the centre circle past two Czechs and into the area, centre-left. His low drive is deflected for a corner. The set-piece is wasted, which seems to be international football's current <em>lietmotif</em>.<br><strong>11</strong> The Czechs, in white, get a free kick just inside the Dutch half. Latal picks it up on the right and feeds Poborsky, who loses the ball to Van Bronkhorst. I guess we'll call that their first 'attack'.<br><strong>14</strong> A corner from the left for Holland. Bergkamp takes, the centre is cleared as far as Kluivert, who collects, turns and shoots in one movement. Repka makes a vital block from 15 yards and Bergkamp follows up with a snap shot from an acute angle on the left that Srnicek does well to hold. Crowd volume goes up a few notches. <br><strong>15</strong> Karel Poborsky is almost sent through but is adjudged offside, much to the relief of 99% of the fans in this Amsterdam Arena.<br><strong>18</strong> Repka turned inside-out by Kluivert, who races away and shoots towards the bottom-left-hand corner. Srnicek parries the effort and then recovers to do enough to distract Zenden from slotting home from an acute angle. Bergkamp is over-eager with the corner and Srnicek catches the ball at his far post.<br><strong>19</strong> He doesn't just overhit crosses you know. Bergkamp, in a little space on the left, makes Latal seasick with a combination of twists and turns, before shooting from 15 yards across Srnicek and just wide of the far post. How long can the Czechs hold out?<br><strong>22</strong> A free kick to Holland from the right. Van Bronkhorst swings it in with his left foot and Srnicek is happy to punch the cross away. This summer, punching is the new catching.<br><strong>23</strong> If you can't beat 'em, foul 'em. Nedved pulls Davids to the ground after the beshaded one had glided past him on the left. Collina is unimpressed and <strong>books</strong> him.<br><strong>26</strong> The Czechs have managed to stop the home side attacking for 30 seconds, but in the process of catching their collective breath, surrender possession. Bergkamp collects with his back to Repka, which he immediately regrets as the Czech defender mows down Dennis with an agricultural challenge. Bergkamp takes a while to get to his feet.<br><strong>27</strong> Bergkamp clattered over again, again from behind. Collina is keeping an eye on the oft-fouled Dutchman, and a card will probably accompany the next rough tackle.<br><strong>30</strong> The visitors would have doubtless taken nil-nil after half an hour had they been offered as much at 7:44pm. Latal does a good job of containing Zenden on the left of the Czech area.<br><strong>32</strong> Another corner to Holland, this time from the right. Cleared, but then Davids, de Boer, Zenden and van Bronkhorst all combine to torment the Czech defence until Srnicek can come and claim a weak lobbed pass.<br><strong>36</strong> In this veritable (what's the collective noun?) embarrassment(?) of orange-clad skill, one man stands out as the sheep on wolf's clothing. Big-score-in-scrabble-first-name Zenden has contributed to at least five moves breaking down with an overeager first touch or poorly-placed pass. They'd be better off missing him out all together. <br><strong>38</strong> Frank de Boer, the Dutch captain, is <strong>booked</strong> for a clumsy challenge on Nedved. The crowd are incredulous. The Czech free kick, in a good position wide right, is wasted.<br><strong>40</strong> The Czech's continue their stubborn resistance, and the Dutch are starting to look a little less composed than they were during the early stages of this match. Uncharacteristically Davids is hassled off the ball on the right, and Nedved feeds Smicer in the centre, who tries to play the return ball but the linesman indicates otherwise. Offside, free kick Holland. <br><strong>44</strong> Dennis Bergkamp, apart from his crossing, has been excellent this half. A long ball from de Boer is met by a cushion Bergkamp header. Seedorf, largely anonymous this period, strikes a netbuster straight into Rep's midriff and the Czechs breathe again.<br><strong>46</strong> Hearts in Dutch mouths as Nerved, in space centre left, hits a rasping, curling drive that beats van der Sar all ends up, but just sails wide of the keeper's top-left-hand corner.<br><strong>47</strong> Half time: Holland 0 - 0 Czech Republic. As the teams walk off the pitch, Kluivert had to be pulled away from referee Collina by a team-mate. What's all that about, then?<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Th Dutch start the second half with a little less fizz than at the kick-off.<br><strong>47</strong> Nedved, surrounded on the left of the Dutch area, somehow conjures a ball into the far post. Van der Sar missed the centre and Poborsky, on his own 3 yards from goal, misses a gilt-edged opportunity to the disbelief of his team-mates.<br><strong>48</strong> The Dutch come forward again with Zenden cutting in from the left. Poborsky makes it a couple of minutes to forget by fouling the Barcelona winger 25 yards from goal. Collina <strong>books</strong> him, when he probably could have let him go and watch him put it in the crowd.<br><strong>50</strong> A surreal free kick as the ball is rolled to Stam, who strikes a piledriver that Srnicek does well to parry. you don't see that very often. <br><strong>54</strong> Jan Koller almost sends 50,000 Dutchmen into despair as he meets a low cross with his right foot from 10 yards. Van de Sar makes a great save to preserve the deadlock.<br><strong>56</strong> Nedved clean through on the left, but instead of the square ball to Poborsky in acres of space, he tries to beat Van der Sar at his near post, unsuccessfully.<br><strong>57</strong> The disappointing Seedorf is <strong>substituted</strong> for Ronald de Boer.<br><strong>58</strong> Nedved rises majestically above Davids to meet a Smicer cross. His header strikes van der Sar's left upright and bounces along the goal-line into the relieved keeper's arms. Nedved cannot believe it.<br><strong>62</strong> Davids' trickery on the left gives him enough space to float in a cross. Srnicek comes to meet the ball with his fists but clatters into the unfortunate Gabriel, who lies writhing on the ground next to the goal. <br><strong>64</strong> Poborsky floats in a free kick from the right flank 50 yards from goal. The big man Koller rises to meet the ball with his shoulder and the ball cannons off van der Sar's crossbar with the Dutch keeper well beaten.<br><strong>66</strong> A corner to the Czechs, from the left. Repka tries to flick the ball on at the near post, but the Dutch are able to clear.<br><strong>67</strong> A Serie A set-too as Repka (Fiorentina) fouls Davids (Juventus) and is <strong>booked</strong> by Italian referee Collina. The Czech continues to rant at the ref and Davids, until Collina puts his hand on his chest and pushes him away. Nice one, ref!<br><strong>69</strong> Latal is laid up with cramp and is signalling to be substituted. Overmars is jogging by the sideline and Stam is also having a problem with his left eye - he's gone off to get stitched up. Sure enough, Bejbl comes on as a <strong>substitute</strong> for Latal.<br><strong>72</strong> Nedved is involved in a clash of heads and leaves the field for treatment. It's ten-a-side at the moment.<br><strong>74</strong> All the injuries have disrupted the flow of the game at the moment. Stam has had a lot of stitches above his left eye, but the injury is too serious and Stam is <strong>substituted</strong>, with Konterman coming on in his place.<br><strong>76</strong> A great chance for the Czechs, as Poborsky and Rosicky break up the right. The cross is cut out by Frank de Boer and the Dutch are lucky to escape without being punished for leaving so much space at the back&gt;<br><strong>79</strong> Nedved and Zenden collide in the middle. It's Zenden's last 'contribution', as Overmars comes on as his <strong>substitute</strong>. Nedved is carried off on a stretcher but rejoins the action with a heavily strapped right arm.<br><strong>82</strong> Overmars gets his first go at Poborsky on the left. He manages o get in the cross, but Repka heads it away. The play is switched to Reiziger, who forces a corner on the right. Konterman makes the late run and the ball hits his foot rather than a full-blooded strike. The effort bounces wide of the near post.<br><strong>84</strong> Smicer's work here is done. He is <strong>substituted</strong> for Kuka.<br><strong>86</strong> The Czech's keep battling and the men in Orange are starting to look a little desperate.<br><strong>87</strong> Rosicky dances his way in from the right as three nervous Dutchmen watch his quick feet. Eventually Davids stabs the ball clear, and the Dutch can break.<br><strong>88 Penalty to Holland!</strong> Referee Collina's just earned himself free room and board in Holland for life. Ronald de Boer was, apparently, held back from jumping to meet a cross from Overmars on the left.<br><strong>90 GOAL! Holland 1 - 0 Czech Republic</strong> Frank de Boer makes no mistake from the spot and the Czechs are heartbroken.<br><strong>91</strong> Four extra minutes to play. If there's any justice the Czechs will score two.<br><strong>92</strong> Van Bronkhorst is <strong>booked</strong> for an agricultural challenge and then it all kicks off with shenanigans on the Czech bench. Collina jogs over and brandishes the <strong>red card</strong> at Latal, who has just come off.<br><strong>94</strong> A flurry of corners for the visitors causes some anxious moments for the Dutch. The last throw of the dice comes from a free kick taken deep in his won half by Srnicek, who finds Koller in the Dutch area. His chested pass finds Bejbl, who can only blaze wide from 10 yards out.<br><strong>95</strong> Lucky, lucky Holland 1 - 0 Czech Republic<br></p>",

How much better if he showed some true grit and used the time to take some big decisions.</p> <p>There is much more that the Government could do. But a start on these areas would do much to restore faith in the political process. Leadership on the constitution and Europe would take us into a new era of politics.</p> <p>Valuing public servants would boost morale among those on the front line of implementing government policy. A new approach to sustainability would revolutionise the way we think about the environment. And helping the poorest pensioners would show that politicians can deliver on bread and butter issues.</p> <p>Westminster is a jungle - and the hunter can always smell fear on its prey. The worst thing Blair can do is to run scared and allow a culture of timidity to overcome Whitehall. After 18 years of misery under the Tories, Blair and New Labour were not elected to take easy decisions.</p>",

The same applies to freedom of information, where the Government's timidity has done it no favours. Meanwhile, the Government has made no significant moves to meet the real desire for more power in the regions of England. What are they scared of? Constitutional modernisation should be accompanied by leadership in Europe. Given the benign economic scenario and the Prime Minister's parliamentary majority, it defies belief that he should not have shown some real leadership on the single currency. He left it too late and will now have to wait until the next Parliament. In the next year, the Government could have achieved much to stabilise the overvalued pound by setting out a clear strategy for joining the euro, but has shied away from doing it. Instead of creating phoney arguments about the selection practices at Oxford, the Government could have courageously admitted that, sometimes, resources are the answer. Why has the Prime Minister not taken a bigger lead on the environment? Why has Labour abandoned Britain's pensioners? There is so much Tony Blair could do with the remaining time left in this Parliament. Why do I get the impression he is twiddling his fingers, waiting for polling day and trying not to offend anyone this side of an election? How much better if he showed some true grit and used the time to take some big decisions. There is much more that the Government could do. But a start on these areas would do much to restore faith in the political process. Leadership on the constitution and Europe would take us into a new era of politics. Valuing public servants would boost morale among those on the front line of implementing government policy. A new approach to sustainability would revolutionise the way we think about the environment. And helping the poorest pensioners would show that politicians can deliver on bread and butter issues. Westminster is a jungle - and the hunter can always smell fear on its prey. The worst thing Blair can do is to run scared and allow a culture of timidity to overcome Whitehall. After 18 years of misery under the Tories, Blair and New Labour were not elected to take easy decisions.",

This is in effect what Allan Kennedy does in The End of Shareholder Value (Orion, \u00a318.99), a new book in which the author, a management consultant who has spent his life working for some of the world's best-known companies, takes an axe to the principles his clients hold most dear. Briefly, Kennedy argues that for the last 20 years, US companies have mortgaged the future in pursuit of short-term financial gain for shareholders. Somewhere, he charges, shareholder value changed from a means of business to its end. The destructive consequences for other stakeholders - employees, customers, suppliers and governments - have been incalculable. </p> <p>Crucial to the process has been the discovery of stock options as a means of 'aligning' management interests with those of shareholders. Stock options are essentially an accounting anomaly, without which they would never have been so widely adopted. But for executives their beauty is that they legitimise management greed: who can complain if top executives share in the riches created for shareholders? Although ordinary investors have benefited from the booming stock markets of the 1990s, it is Kennedy's case that the 'value' created is illusory, the product of downsizing, outsourcing, and restructuring, and financial-engineering ploys like share-buybacks and mergers. None of this has anything to do with customers and products - as will be discovered by investors to their cost when the bubble bursts. By this time the real beneficiaries, boards and top managers (in the US largely the same), will be safely retired. As one top CEO, taxed with the inadequacy of his long-term strategy, told Kennedy: 'Why the fuck should I care? I'll be long gone before anyone finds out.' </p> <p>Short-termism is not in itself a new argument. But Kennedy laces it with a fresh historical perspective. He sees the purpose of business evolving over time. In the first and second waves of business formation, from the family capitalism of the 19th century to the technocratic 1970s, making money was a by-product of benefiting humanity. P&amp;G and Unilever were representative of the first wave, HP and Polaroid of the second. At the end of the second wave, however, a new mentality emerged. This was fuelled by technical developments in company valuation leading to the idea that the only purpose of companies was to increase shareholder value, and by the technological revolution. For Kennedy, these currents converged in the foundation of Intel, inventor of the microprocessor - a company set up, as one employee put it, 'to steal' the process invented by its predecessor, Fairchild. </p> <p>Thus was the age of pure greed born, which finds its apogee in the excesses and abuses of the internet start-ups, many of which have no purpose beyond the flotation that will make their founders rich and leave others to turn the shells into a viable business. It is hardly news that the character of new firms is conditioned by the circumstances of their setting up. But existing business too is caught up in the corrup tion of purpose. Take Jack Welch, for instance, the lauded CEO of the revered General Electric. Quintupled sales with a workforce reduced by one-third would seem to brook no argument. </p> <p>While conceding that Welch is 'extraordinarily talented', Kennedy shows that under Welch GE's biggest investment - $30 billion - has been in share buy-backs. To pay for this, he charges, GE has put its future at risk by slashing payroll, marketing and research and development. GE now makes most of its money from financial services. 'Roll back 20 years to walkie-talkies, the predecessor of mobile phones, and GE was the market No 1. Now Nokia is No 1 and GE is nowhere. That's a direct consequence of shareholder value thinking,' Kennedy alleges. When Welch retires at the end of 2000 he is expected to make up to $1bn on his stock options. </p> <p>Looking at developments in perspective also allows Kennedy to see the dynamic in the shareholder value process. Every action produces a reaction. In this case, the other stakeholders trampled in the rush for shareholder value are fighting back. Kennedy produces the astonishing finding that up to 20 per cent of Americans earning over $100,000 now use specialist lawyers and agents to negotiate the best deal with a new employer. 'They aren't doing com panies any favours,' he notes. </p> <p>Meanwhile, suppliers are consolidating apace to give themselves the muscle to resist never-ending demands for lower prices. There are now just two or three car-seat manufacturers in the world, and other industries such as aerospace and textiles are going in the same direction. Finally customer loyalty has been declining with increasing consumer disillusion - and the internet, with its potential for instant comparison, is set to give it the coup de grace. 'Internet shopping will kill branded goods stone dead,' says Kennedy. </p> <p>Kennedy believes Europe can still avert the worst excesses of what another writer, Edward Luttwak, has termed 'turbo-capitalism'. But he has little comfort for the US. 'No one wants to imagine a world in which the stock market doesn't go up 100 per cent a year. The attitude is: don't threaten my portfolio,' he says. What's more, the excesses can't reach the political agenda because both political parties are in hock to corporate funding. 'In an ideal world, we'd correct the abuses through regulation,' says Kennedy. 'Unfortunately, I don't think anything less than a major crash will make people step back and look clearly at where it's all gone wrong.' </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Thus was the age of pure greed born, which finds its apogee in the excesses and abuses of the internet start-ups, many of which have no purpose beyond the flotation that will make their founders rich and leave others to turn the shells into a viable business. It is hardly news that the character of new firms is conditioned by the circumstances of their setting up. But existing business too is caught up in the corrup tion of purpose. Take Jack Welch, for instance, the lauded CEO of the revered General Electric. Quintupled sales with a workforce reduced by one-third would seem to brook no argument. While conceding that Welch is 'extraordinarily talented', Kennedy shows that under Welch GE's biggest investment - $30 billion - has been in share buy-backs. To pay for this, he charges, GE has put its future at risk by slashing payroll, marketing and research and development. GE now makes most of its money from financial services. 'Roll back 20 years to walkie-talkies, the predecessor of mobile phones, and GE was the market No 1. Now Nokia is No 1 and GE is nowhere. That's a direct consequence of shareholder value thinking,' Kennedy alleges. When Welch retires at the end of 2000 he is expected to make up to $1bn on his stock options. Looking at developments in perspective also allows Kennedy to see the dynamic in the shareholder value process. Every action produces a reaction. In this case, the other stakeholders trampled in the rush for shareholder value are fighting back. Kennedy produces the astonishing finding that up to 20 per cent of Americans earning over $100,000 now use specialist lawyers and agents to negotiate the best deal with a new employer. 'They aren't doing com panies any favours,' he notes. Meanwhile, suppliers are consolidating apace to give themselves the muscle to resist never-ending demands for lower prices. There are now just two or three car-seat manufacturers in the world, and other industries such as aerospace and textiles are going in the same direction. Finally customer loyalty has been declining with increasing consumer disillusion - and the internet, with its potential for instant comparison, is set to give it the coup de grace. 'Internet shopping will kill branded goods stone dead,' says Kennedy. Kennedy believes Europe can still avert the worst excesses of what another writer, Edward Luttwak, has termed 'turbo-capitalism'. But he has little comfort for the US. 'No one wants to imagine a world in which the stock market doesn't go up 100 per cent a year. The attitude is: don't threaten my portfolio,' he says. What's more, the excesses can't reach the political agenda because both political parties are in hock to corporate funding. 'In an ideal world, we'd correct the abuses through regulation,' says Kennedy. 'Unfortunately, I don't think anything less than a major crash will make people step back and look clearly at where it's all gone wrong.' \u0095 simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>As the row rages over whether the old boy network, with its roots in the public school system, is still influencing who gets into the Oxbridge colleges, and by implication the top jobs, the workplace is as good an environment as any to look for evidence of its continuing existence. </p> <p>Once, the Code of the Bertie Woosters may have seemed more relevant to the boardrooms of larger companies than those drafted by the Equal Opportunities Commission. But now you could be forgiven for believing that we live in a meritocracy: more and more firms declare that they are equal opportunities employers, and breaking the race, sex or disability laws becomes more and more expensive. </p> <p>Look more closely, however, and you'll find vestiges of the old order, if sometimes in a modern guise. </p> <p>Business consultant Judi James, who has visited dozens of companies over many years, says: 'The genuine old boys' network does still exist, and its members are the dinosaurs of business. It usually operates in very large companies, where there are still some people at the top who think the way you button your jacket says more about you than how you do your job. Some are just there until they pop their clogs. </p> <p>'I've spoken to people who say they would like to look a bit different at work, but the chief executive or chairman thinks a pin-striped suit and school tie still matters.' </p> <p>You need look no further than the law to find confirmation of this. The solicitors' governing body, the Law Society, is still waiting for a response from the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, to its decision, late last year to boycott the 'secret soundings' that lead to the appointment of judges and QCs. The society's president, Robert Sayer, says this system is 'more appropriate to the nineteenth century than the twenty-first'. </p> <p>It keeps alive an 'outdated, discriminatory old boys' network' and unfairly favours 'the traditional elite of the bar in preference to solicitors, women and ethnic minorities', the society says. </p> <p>According to Sayer, this system, which Lord Irvine shows no sign of changing, leads to people appointing their friends. Fifty-two per cent of judicial appointments are made from only seven barristers' chambers. </p> <p>In the medical profession, Health Minister John Denham this month announced that doctors will in future have annual appraisals. This came in response to the results of a year-long inquiry into gynaecologist Rodney Ledward.

      "bodyText": "As the row rages over whether the old boy network, with its roots in the public school system, is still influencing who gets into the Oxbridge colleges, and by implication the top jobs, the workplace is as good an environment as any to look for evidence of its continuing existence. Once, the Code of the Bertie Woosters may have seemed more relevant to the boardrooms of larger companies than those drafted by the Equal Opportunities Commission. But now you could be forgiven for believing that we live in a meritocracy: more and more firms declare that they are equal opportunities employers, and breaking the race, sex or disability laws becomes more and more expensive. Look more closely, however, and you'll find vestiges of the old order, if sometimes in a modern guise. Business consultant Judi James, who has visited dozens of companies over many years, says: 'The genuine old boys' network does still exist, and its members are the dinosaurs of business. It usually operates in very large companies, where there are still some people at the top who think the way you button your jacket says more about you than how you do your job. Some are just there until they pop their clogs. 'I've spoken to people who say they would like to look a bit different at work, but the chief executive or chairman thinks a pin-striped suit and school tie still matters.' You need look no further than the law to find confirmation of this. The solicitors' governing body, the Law Society, is still waiting for a response from the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, to its decision, late last year to boycott the 'secret soundings' that lead to the appointment of judges and QCs. The society's president, Robert Sayer, says this system is 'more appropriate to the nineteenth century than the twenty-first'. It keeps alive an 'outdated, discriminatory old boys' network' and unfairly favours 'the traditional elite of the bar in preference to solicitors, women and ethnic minorities', the society says. According to Sayer, this system, which Lord Irvine shows no sign of changing, leads to people appointing their friends. Fifty-two per cent of judicial appointments are made from only seven barristers' chambers. In the medical profession, Health Minister John Denham this month announced that doctors will in future have annual appraisals. This came in response to the results of a year-long inquiry into gynaecologist Rodney Ledward. The inquiry held that an 'old boys' network' had been crucial in keeping him in his post for 17 years, despite a flood of complaints from patients and staff. About 400 women have now spoken out about healthy wombs being removed and other disastrous operations. Meanwhile, in the wider, and in theory more aggressive, world of business, friends are equally important. In KPMG Consulting's 1999 Business Leadership survey most of the 200 senior directors of large companies in the UK and the Irish Republic believed that leadership positions are gained through hard work - on average this was awarded seven out of 10 in terms of importance. Yet the report goes on: 'Interestingly, however, given the alleged meritocratic outlook of modern business, it would appear that the age of the old school tie is far from over. Most surprisingly, the younger group [the under-45s] are more inclined to rate \"knowing the right people\" as an important factor in career progression than their older equivalents.' On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 as the most important, 51 per cent of the younger age group gave an answer of 7 or above, compared with just 28 per cent of the older group. A higher proportion of these same younger respondents were Oxbridge-educated, the KPMG study found. And in a twist to the notion of the importance of powerful friends, the survey noted a rise of the 'power couple': 'There is strong evidence to suggest that, in their personal lives, younger business leaders are showing a greater tendency to form \"power partnerships\" with those of a similar business status.' Who said the age of romance was dead? Knowing the right people does not just help you to climb the slippery pole - it can also help to ensure that you are paid sufficiently well for your efforts.

Banks, supermarkets, clothing retailers, airlines, estate agents and investment houses are all urging customers to buy their goods and services on the net. </p> <p>Consumers testing out the internet experience have not always been pleased with the results. Cash has received numerous complaints from readers who have had difficulty with net banks, and in this issue you can read the results (and frustrations) of three fairly computer-literate journalists trying to use supermarket online ordering sites. </p> <p>Richard Thackray, director of online bank First-e, says these problems are partly caused by the age and (un)sophistication of PCs owned by consumers. While banks and other financial organisations have state-of-the-art systems, their customers are often using elderly hardware and software. </p> <p>But he also thinks customers' aggravations are exacerbated by their expectations. 'We thought customers would compare our service levels to those of the high street banks. But they don't - we're being compared with the best e-commerce sites, like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a>.' </p> <p>These teething problems obscure the fact that the internet can bring genuine benefits. Internet banking services have already shown that the cost savings of a computer-based business can be passed on. Mac Millington, managing director of business-to-consumer products at Abbey National, says that banking processes at Abbey's new online bank, Cahoot, (launching tomorrow) cost 60 per cent of the amount paid by traditional branch-based banks. 'This percentage will fall as we build up customer numbers. We will share the savings with our customers.' </p> <p>Egg, the first deposit and investment bank to offer its services purely via the internet, initially led the field on rates, and is still offering a competitive 'no notice' account at 6.3 per cent gross for sums of \u00a31 or more. Likewise Smile, the Co-op's online bank, pays 4.75 per cent gross on sums of \u00a31 upwards in its current account, while First-e pays 4.88 per cent gross (although its current account does not yet offer direct debits or standing orders). </p> <p>So, how does the newest net bank shape up? Cahoot is offering credit cards free from interest charges in the first year for the first 25,000 customers. However, those who miss the special offer will have to pay between 7 per cent and 11 per cent, considerably more expensive than other credit cards already on the market.</p> <p>The bank will not be sending out monthly paper statements - customers must remember to visit their account at Cahoot to make payments, a move designed to keep customers coming back to the site. The bank's current account rate is also disappointing - between 3 and 4.4 per cent - compared with competitors. </p> <p>Millington defends the pricing on the grounds that Cahoot wants to launch with rates that it can sustain indefinitely. He also believes that customers will be swayed by service standards. Cahoot has outsourced much of its admin to Fiserve, a third-party administration specialist. Outsourcing is often criticised on the grounds that the product provider can lose control over service standards, but Millington defends this decision: 'All the shift managers will be our staff, all the training is by us and we have agreements on service standards.' </p> <p>\u0095 Cash is interested in hearing what readers think of those standards.

      "body": "<p>Suddenly everyone seems to be talking about Wap. Once an idea familiar only to a handful of techno-anoraks, now everyone is busy comparing websites on their Wap mobile phones.</p> <p> Wap (pronounced to rhyme with snap) stands for Wireless Application Protocol, a set of standards agreed by the major players in the telecoms industry which determines the configuration of web pages so that they can be accessed quickly and easily by mobile phones.</p> <p> Businesses are investing hundreds of millions of pounds in making sure they will benefit. Already we have Europe's first Wap auction, shopping and directory site, www.CallRed.com, that is designed to help 'time-poor' consumers purchase goods or bid for memorabilia online while on the move. Last month the UK's second largest mobile phone operator, BT Cellnet, said it was to sell its Wap phones in 1,500 Asda, Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco stores. </p> <p> The likes of BT Cellnet and Vodafone know that in the future they won't be making their money from conventional telephony, but from people who want to browse, buy, order, view, sell whatever, wherever and whenever they want.</p> <p> One of the key services that will benefit from Wap technology is banking, some of whose biggest names are rushing to arm customers with Wap phones. The Halifax's internet bank, Intelligent Finance is handing out the devices for free to its first 150,000 customers through an alliance with BT Cellnet. Leading online rival Egg is in the middle of a two-month Wap trial. The range of services being tested is limited at the moment. Users can check their balance and obtain mini-statements from their current and credit card accounts.

      "bodyText": "Suddenly everyone seems to be talking about Wap. Once an idea familiar only to a handful of techno-anoraks, now everyone is busy comparing websites on their Wap mobile phones. Wap (pronounced to rhyme with snap) stands for Wireless Application Protocol, a set of standards agreed by the major players in the telecoms industry which determines the configuration of web pages so that they can be accessed quickly and easily by mobile phones. Businesses are investing hundreds of millions of pounds in making sure they will benefit. Already we have Europe's first Wap auction, shopping and directory site, www.CallRed.com, that is designed to help 'time-poor' consumers purchase goods or bid for memorabilia online while on the move. Last month the UK's second largest mobile phone operator, BT Cellnet, said it was to sell its Wap phones in 1,500 Asda, Safeway, Sainsbury and Tesco stores. The likes of BT Cellnet and Vodafone know that in the future they won't be making their money from conventional telephony, but from people who want to browse, buy, order, view, sell whatever, wherever and whenever they want. One of the key services that will benefit from Wap technology is banking, some of whose biggest names are rushing to arm customers with Wap phones. The Halifax's internet bank, Intelligent Finance is handing out the devices for free to its first 150,000 customers through an alliance with BT Cellnet. Leading online rival Egg is in the middle of a two-month Wap trial. The range of services being tested is limited at the moment. Users can check their balance and obtain mini-statements from their current and credit card accounts. There is also a stripped-down share viewing service. The Woolwich, however, is fanatical about Wap. It started offering the service nearly two months ago, enabling its account holders to buy a Nokia 7110 handset, which sells for \u00a3130 when signing up to Vodafone, for \u00a350. Users are given free connection and 20 per cent off Vodafone's usual monthly line rental. The Woolwich service, in a taste of things to come perhaps, allows users to transfer money between accounts, pay bills, check balances and recent transactions, and access a range of information services, such as the news and weather. With other banks catching the Wap bug, it can't be long before we're all being offered free or heavily subsidised handsets. But such offers will carry terms and conditions - and when banks start issuing customers with mobile phones, alarm bells should sound. To buy a Wap phone without signing up to a particular operator can cost anything between \u00a3350 and \u00a3700. The reason they are a cheaper on the high street is because the operator, Vodafone for example, subsidises their cost in return for the user signing up to a contract. Likewise, your bank will issue you with a Wap phone only if you agree to accept a range of conditions. Woolwich customers, for example, have to take its credit card and open a current account. It is important to read the small print and check what you are signing up to. Do you have to go on to a particular tariff? Do you have to use the phone for a certain number of minutes a month? Will you end up paying more in credit card charges than you've saved on your Wap phone? You may even decide it is wise to wait a bit. Wap is not a passing fad and more deals and offers will be coming on the market over the next few months. First Direct, for example, will launch its own Wap service next month. You might want to hold back to see which banks have the best technology and phones as well as the best financial offers. Whichever deal you choose, the days of bank queues are practically over.",

      "body": "<p>The relentless march of science always seems to stir up messy human problems which are far removed from the lab or the lecture theatre. In the case of genetics, it is unlikely that those who launched the human genome project in the Eighties gave much thought to the issue of insurance. </p> <p>But for those individuals who consider taking the highly stressful step of undergoing a genetic test, the effect on their ability to buy income protection, life, travel and medical cover, or to obtain mortgages, is a key concern. </p> <p>Around the world, hundreds of scientists are striving to map out and interpret all the genes that go to make a human being. The completion of the project is expected to lead to massive leaps forward in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and in predicting, through the identification of faulty genes, an individual's pre-disposition to certain conditions. </p> <p>Already available are genetic tests that can indicate whether you are likely to have inherited one of a handful of relatively rare diseases that afflicted other members of your family. But within the next five to 10 years doctors believe they will have tests relating to the most common conditions that cause years of symptoms and premature death. </p> <p>According to a report in the medical magazine, the Lancet, earlier this year, all UK centres offering genetic testing for breast cancer had seen patients who refused testing because they were worried the results could affect their insurability. In the case of breast cancer this is particularly worrying. Preventative measures - albeit drastic ones such as taking Tamoxifen, a powerful drug, or even prophylactic mastectomy - can be taken if the tests show you are likely to develop the disease. </p> <p>There are currently seven so-called monogenic conditions for which there is a genetic test used by the British insurance industry. Apart from hereditary breast cancer, the tests are for Huntington's disease, early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, Myotonic dystrophy, familial adenomatosis polyposis, multiple endocrine neoplasia, and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has drawn up a code of practice that allows its members to ask applicants whether they have undergone genetic testing for any of these conditions, and their outcome. No insurer should ever ask an applicant to take a test. </p> <p>The Government has set up the Genetic and Insurance Committee, or GAIC, which is to consider the accuracy and reliability of these tests, and of others the industry may present in the future. It is due to make its first pronouncements this summer. If it decides that any of the existing tests should not be used by insurers, the ABI has said it will refund any extra premiums so far paid by life policy applicants - about 4 per cent of the total - who are considered so risky that they have to pay between 50 per cent and five times more than normal. About 1 per cent are refused cover altogether because their risks are considered too high. </p> <p>Delyth Morgan, the chief executive of the Breakthrough Breast Cancer campaign, is worried. 'Our position is that we've missed out a stage in the debate in considering the accuracy of the tests. We should be considering whether we should be using these tests at all.' </p> <p>The Government decided in 1998 to ignore a recommendation from the Human Genetics Advisory Committee that it place a moratorium on the use of such tests. But in several other countries, including France and the Netherlands, there are moratoria in place. In Austria, Denmark and 18 states in the US, a complete ban has been put on using genetic testing to assess risk. </p> <p>Harry Cayton of the Alzheimer's Society is equally concerned about the position in this country. He says that few people are currently affected by the insurance industry's access to genetic test information because there are so few types of test available, and they are for relatively rare strains of the diseases involved. For example, the hereditary breast cancer for which tests have been developed accounts for only about 5 per cent of all cases of that disease in the UK. </p> <p>In the case of Alzheimer's, the test is for the 1 per cent of sufferers who develop an inherited early-onset strain. But work on identifying genes behind late-onset Alzheimer's, which afflicts a large proportion of the population, is going on. This is expected to result in tests becoming available in the next few years. </p> <p>Furthermore, tests for a predisposition to heart disease are thought to be not far off. Many people whose close relatives have died from heart conditions will wish to take tests because they will want to know if they should change their diet and lifestyle, or undergo regular checkups and perhaps take some medication as preventative measures. But will they then find themselves paying inflated insurance premiums, or unable to get cover at all? </p> <p>'If I were the insurance industry I would be pushing now when it is easy, because I would know it would be of great benefit to me in five or 10 years time. Once the principle is established that the industry can use this data, the pattern will be set,' Cayton said. </p> <p>Some in the medical profession fear that probing questions from insurers could dissuade some people from undergoing tests as part of clinical trials. Another fear is that insurance companies could bring in compulsory testing for some applicants through the back door by making cover prohibitively expensive for those with a family history of chronic illnesses who have not taken the relevant test. </p> <p>Standard Life is one of the few insurance companies to state that it does not need to know whether you have taken a genetic test. But if you wish to put on your application form that you have had a negative result for a test for, for example, Huntington's disease, then this is taken into account. In fact the test for Huntington's is one where a test result could actually help someone applying for insurance. If one of your parents suffered from the disease, then there is a 50-50 chance that you will develop it. </p> <p>'If we had an application from someone with a fam ily history of Huntington's disease there could be an extra charge,' John Gibb, chief underwriter at Standard Life explained. 'If the result [which they tell us about] is negative then they would go onto ordinary rates.' And even if you choose to tell Standard Life you have had a positive result, it will charge you as if you are still a 50-50 risk. </p> <p>However, this laudable stance is unlikely to last. According to Gibb, further developments in genetic testing mean that 'it is not a sustainable approach in the long-term'. He supports the ABI's position on wanting access to genetic test data. And he does not believe that fears of an uninsurable underclass will be realised. 'I think it is alarmist. If you look at the history of dealing with medical conditions, the more you know the better insurance you can offer. The more knowledge that is available, the easier it is to assess a risk.' </p> <p>Malcolm Tarling, a spokesman for the ABI, said: 'We want to do all we can to reassure people.' But he pointed out: 'There is already a group of people who cannot get life assurance; people with terminal cancer or full-blown Aids.' </p> <p>In Britain the chief concern is that applications for life assurance and mortgages might be affected. Mortgage lenders do not tend to insist on life cover nowadays, but homebuyers with partners, spouses and children generally want to protect their families. The ABI code of practice specifies that people should not be asked about genetic testing when applying for life cover on homeloans up to \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>In the US, as befits a country where private medicine is the norm, there is a great deal of concern about health insurance. 'It worries me that because we have a publicly-funded health service we do not think too much about this. In the US, where health has to be insured, it is a huge issue,' said Breakthrough's Morgan. This campaign suggests we should not allow the existence of the National Health Service to make us complacent. The future of the NHS is the subject of constant debate and some bodies, such as the Institute of Directors, are arguing for a move towards an insurance-based health service. </p> <p>Cayton of the Alzheimer's Society is concerned insurers access to test results 'will put paid to any idea of any insurance-based long-term care system'. Insurers are unlikely to offer affordable premiums to anyone who eventually tests positive for late-onset Alzheimer's, he suggests. Therefore those who will have most need of long-term care may not be able to get insured. So it could be argued that insurers' insistence on access to genetic test results is unfair to individuals, and likely to undermine potential reforms of the welfare state. </p> <p>For their part, insurers argue that not having access to test results would also be unfair. If, for example, someone took a genetic test and discovered they were 80 per cent likely to develop a fatal disease within a few years, then they could buy multiple insurance policies at standard rates - if they did not need to tell the insurers about taking the test. </p> <p>The insurers also argue that looking at genetic tests is only an attempt to refine the current practice of studying family history. For example, if someone's parent had a disease that can be inherited, insurers are likely to charge them extra or even refuse cover. But if the applicant has a test that comes back negative, or if they have a positive test but then some treatment that means they will not get the disease, then it could put them back into the low-risk group that would mean lower premiums. </p> <p>This will offer little comfort to a group of people whose genes make them likely to develop incurable diseases. It is this group that risks becoming the uninsurable underclass of the twenty-first century. Just hope you never find out you are part of it. </p> <p><strong>Diseases they can test for</strong></p> <p>Tests for potential policyholders are approved by the Association of British Insurers for many conditions.</p> <p><strong>1. Huntington's disease</strong>, formerly known as Huntington's Chorea, is a rare inherited brain disorder. It causes involuntary dance-like movements (chorea, from the Greek for dance) and dementia. There is no cure, but the symptoms can be treated. It begins most often in mid-adulthood and progresses slowly. A blood test can show whether you inherited the disease from your parents. Without the test, you are presumed to be a 50-50 risk. </p> <p><strong>2. Myotonic dystrophy (MD)</strong>. An inherited neuromuscular disease in which there is progressive muscle weakening and wasting. Can become more severe as it is passed from one generation to another. The classic physical signs include atrophy of facial muscles, cataracts and delayed muscle relaxation. </p> <p><strong>3. Familial adenomatosis polyposis</strong>. People affected develop multiple large-bowel polyps, usually after the age of 20, which later, almost inevitably, develop into bowel cancer. People who are at 50 per cent risk, as the offspring or siblings of an affected person, are offered screening for a particular genetic mutation. Those that test positive are offered regular colonoscopic screening and, when appropriate, a total colectomy, or the removal of the colon. According to the ABI, positive or negative genetic tests in a healthy person have high relevance to insurance contracts. Insurers would take into account the markedly improved prognosis of a gene-positive individual who has appropriate surgery. </p> <p><strong>4. Multiple endocrine neoplasia</strong>. Rare conditions in which benign or malignant tumours develop in two or more endocrine glands. Genetic testing has been available two years. </p> <p><strong>5. Familial Alzheimer's disease</strong>. Kills nerve cells in areas of the brain, leading to the loss of memory and language. In more than 95 per cent of cases the cause is either multifactorial, or non-genetic. The ABI believes genetic test reults would only be relevant to insurers if, in a particular family, there was a known mutation in one of the rare causative genes. </p> <p><strong>6. Hereditary breast cancer</strong>. As with Alzheimer's, the great majority of people affected do not have specific gene defects likely to to cause a strong predisposition in their relatives. In the small number of families in which there is a known mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, any genetic test results available from a relative at risk would have a serious bearing on several types of insurance. A women aged 30 with a known BRCA1 mutation and a family history of breast cancer, for example, would lose about seven years' life expectancy. </p> <p><strong>7. Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy</strong>. Varies greatly in severity, but most sufferers will have a specific gene change. Life expectancy is not reduced for most of them. Late onset might affect long-term care insurance.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Mike Powell is 23 and it was 23 years ago that Glamorgan made their first and, until today, their only appearance in a one-day final. With an ingenuity for finding tickets honed on years of experience at rugby grounds such as Twickenham and Lansdowne Road, the Welsh took over Lord's for the 1977 Gillette Cup final against Middlesex. </p> <p>But that was as good as it got for Glamorgan, who slipped to a five-wicket defeat in a match chiefly remembered for the six Mike Llewellyn hit off John Emburey which landed on the pavilion roof and is acknowledged to be the biggest hit ever seen at headquarters. </p> <p>Llewellyn was one of a crop of promising youngsters on Glamorgan's books. Summers of decline after their 1969 championship success were expected to be arrested by players such as Llewellyn, John Hopkins, Gwyn Richards, Alan Wilkins and Alan Lewis Jones but that potential was not fulfilled. </p> <p>Glamorgan have slumped again since winning the championship three years ago; in the Second Division of both the County Championship and the National League, their appearance in today's Benson &amp; Hedges Cup final against Gloucestershire comes as a welcome diversion and a dream made reality after failing in four semi-finals since 1988. </p> <p>They have missed Hugh Morris, Tony Cottey and Waqar Younis from the 1997 vintage. Powell, an aggressive right-handed batsman who made a double century on his first-class debut against Oxford University three years ago, took over from Cottey but this season he has been coming in at first wicket down rather than at No5 as Glamorgan seek to blend his ability with responsibility and, unlike the 70s, translate promise into runs. </p> <p>\"Mike has the ability to make it as an international cricketer,\" said the Glamorgan coach Jeff Hammond, who played five tests for Australia in the 70s. \"But so have a number of other batsmen on the county circuit. I would say there are 20 or 25 batsmen like Mike in Britain who have the ability and the technique to go all the way. Those who make it will be the ones who are mentally toughest, the ones who are able to cope with expectation and harden up. </p> <p>\"They will be judged on performances and the bigger the occasion, such as a Lord's final, the more they will have to prove. Mike is on the verge, approaching the watershed.\" </p> <p>Powell scored 67 in the semi-final against Surrey last month and his partnership of 133 in 27 overs with his captain Matthew Maynard was pivotal. </p> <p>Surrey's assistant coach Alan Butcher, who was instrumental at the end of the 80s in transforming Glamorgan from a laughing stock into a team believing in themselves, said: \"I noticed Mike a few years ago playing second XI cricket. I thought he had something about him then and his innings in the semi-final confirmed that. He is definitely one to watch.\" </p> <p>Born in Abergavenny, Powell has set a target of making the next England A squad. \"This is only my second full season in the Glamorgan side,\" he said. \"A lot has been written about me but I still have it all to prove. A big difference this year is that I have been batting with Matthew Maynard regularly and that has allowed me to look and learn and be more selective. I am not under as much pressure to prove myself.\" </p> <p>\"I can see some of me in Mike with his desire to dominate the bowling,\" said Maynard. \"He likes to play shots in front of the wicket but he has learned to be selective. It did not quite happen for me with England, not that I thought I was ever really given a chance.\" </p> <p>Maynard's century against Surrey was full of controlled aggression. Like Robert Croft, Steve Watkin, Adrian Dale and Steve James, he was determined not to let the opportunity slip away again. </p> <p>\"It was not a typical Maynard innings because he did not hit many boundaries,\" said Butcher, \"but he dominated the bowling and made light of a difficult wicket.\" </p> <p>Glamorgan will look to their captain again today and Maynard's team talk will be brief: \"Relax and enjoy the occasion. It has only taken us 23 years to get here.\" </p> <p> <strong> Gloucestershire</strong> (from): T H C Hancock, K J Barnett, R J Cunliffe, M G N Windows, *M W Alleyne, I J Harvey, J N Snape, R C Russell, C G Taylor, J Lewis, J M M Averis, A M Smith. </p> <p><strong> Glamorgan </strong> (from): R D B Croft, M T G Elliott, M J Powell, *M P Maynard, A Dale, S P James, K Newell, A G Wharf, A D Shaw, S L Watkin, O T Parkin, S D Thomas. </p> <p><strong> Umpires:</strong> K E Palmer and G Sharp. </p> <p><strong> Third umpire: </strong> A G T Whitehead.</p>",

Summers of decline after their 1969 championship success were expected to be arrested by players such as Llewellyn, John Hopkins, Gwyn Richards, Alan Wilkins and Alan Lewis Jones but that potential was not fulfilled. Glamorgan have slumped again since winning the championship three years ago; in the Second Division of both the County Championship and the National League, their appearance in today's Benson &amp; Hedges Cup final against Gloucestershire comes as a welcome diversion and a dream made reality after failing in four semi-finals since 1988. They have missed Hugh Morris, Tony Cottey and Waqar Younis from the 1997 vintage. Powell, an aggressive right-handed batsman who made a double century on his first-class debut against Oxford University three years ago, took over from Cottey but this season he has been coming in at first wicket down rather than at No5 as Glamorgan seek to blend his ability with responsibility and, unlike the 70s, translate promise into runs. \"Mike has the ability to make it as an international cricketer,\" said the Glamorgan coach Jeff Hammond, who played five tests for Australia in the 70s. \"But so have a number of other batsmen on the county circuit. I would say there are 20 or 25 batsmen like Mike in Britain who have the ability and the technique to go all the way. Those who make it will be the ones who are mentally toughest, the ones who are able to cope with expectation and harden up. \"They will be judged on performances and the bigger the occasion, such as a Lord's final, the more they will have to prove. Mike is on the verge, approaching the watershed.\" Powell scored 67 in the semi-final against Surrey last month and his partnership of 133 in 27 overs with his captain Matthew Maynard was pivotal. Surrey's assistant coach Alan Butcher, who was instrumental at the end of the 80s in transforming Glamorgan from a laughing stock into a team believing in themselves, said: \"I noticed Mike a few years ago playing second XI cricket. I thought he had something about him then and his innings in the semi-final confirmed that. He is definitely one to watch.\" Born in Abergavenny, Powell has set a target of making the next England A squad. \"This is only my second full season in the Glamorgan side,\" he said. \"A lot has been written about me but I still have it all to prove. A big difference this year is that I have been batting with Matthew Maynard regularly and that has allowed me to look and learn and be more selective. I am not under as much pressure to prove myself.\" \"I can see some of me in Mike with his desire to dominate the bowling,\" said Maynard. \"He likes to play shots in front of the wicket but he has learned to be selective. It did not quite happen for me with England, not that I thought I was ever really given a chance.\" Maynard's century against Surrey was full of controlled aggression. Like Robert Croft, Steve Watkin, Adrian Dale and Steve James, he was determined not to let the opportunity slip away again. \"It was not a typical Maynard innings because he did not hit many boundaries,\" said Butcher, \"but he dominated the bowling and made light of a difficult wicket.\" Glamorgan will look to their captain again today and Maynard's team talk will be brief: \"Relax and enjoy the occasion. It has only taken us 23 years to get here.\" Gloucestershire (from): T H C Hancock, K J Barnett, R J Cunliffe, M G N Windows, *M W Alleyne, I J Harvey, J N Snape, R C Russell, C G Taylor, J Lewis, J M M Averis, A M Smith.

But London's new mayor, Ken Livingstone, could find the yellow bus concept politically attrac tive to support the introduction of congestion charging in central London.</p> <p>Mr Lockhead said that \"by reducing the need for the school run, these services will also cut double parking outside schools as parents drop off and pick up children.\"</p> <p>A survey for FirstGroup by Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen has studied travel to school patterns across a range of schools in the city. Some 60% arrived by car, while 33% walked. Less than 1% cycled or went by bus.</p> <p>The same survey found that up to 19% of parents with children at primary schools would want their children to use dedicated bus transport.

Mr Lockhead said that FirstGroup had the buying power to create a purpose-built fleet of yellow buses, each costing no more than \u00a330,000. By next year he thought that at least 100 could be operating in the UK, with a swift rise over the next five years after testing. The cost of a typical new single deck bus is \u00a3110,000, which no local authority can afford. Mr Lockhead said that there was no reason why some of the money raised from the government's congestion charging plans could not be used to help fund imaginative schemes in crowded cities. The implementation of John Prescott's congestion charging plans by local authorities is still several years away. But London's new mayor, Ken Livingstone, could find the yellow bus concept politically attrac tive to support the introduction of congestion charging in central London. Mr Lockhead said that \"by reducing the need for the school run, these services will also cut double parking outside schools as parents drop off and pick up children.\" A survey for FirstGroup by Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen has studied travel to school patterns across a range of schools in the city. Some 60% arrived by car, while 33% walked. Less than 1% cycled or went by bus. The same survey found that up to 19% of parents with children at primary schools would want their children to use dedicated bus transport. The figure would rise to 38% for secondary school children.",

      "body": "<p>Every tournament must have a Group of Death and Euro 2000 will be no different from the norm. This year's is, logically enough, Group D but one suspects it will take something altogether more dastardly to squeeze the life out of the French. </p> <p>Although it required a <em>faux pas</em> from a Russian goalkeeper to help ensure they are here at all, France's jitters in the qualifiers are long forgotten and their status as world champions demands their inclusion among the favourites to climb the winners' podium in Rotterdam on July 2. </p> <p>With the Czechs and Dutch to come in a group comprising four previous winners, the natural assumption is that tomorrow's Danish fare inside the Jan Breydel stadium will probably be their least demanding exercise. It would be hard to argue otherwise. </p> <p>Much, of course, could depend on Nicolas Anelka being in the right form (not to mention frame of mind) but Les Bleus have other attacking options even if their young and frequently misguided striker decides to throw one of his wobblies. </p> <p>Thierry Henry's surge of form after overcoming his teething problems at Arsenal should justify a first-team place, especially with Christophe Dugarry suspended, while behind him remain many of the usual suspects from France 98. </p> <p>Indeed, if continuity breeds success, then France must already be halfway there. Their coach Roger Lemerre was Aim\u00e9 Jacquet's right-hand man in the World Cup and no fewer than 18 members of his squad were involved two years ago. </p> <p>Zinedine Zidane has been strangely overlooked among the nominations for the tournament's most likely stars but the former world and European footballer of the year is still a force to be reckoned with and, if Didier Deschamps continues to wilt, this could finally be the chance for Patrick Vieira to prove his international worth. </p> <p>\"This set of players won the World Cup, so there is no reason why we cannot win the European Championship,\" Lemerre said yesterday. \"We will travel to Bruges with a lot of confidence but a lot of humility as well, for we are facing a side that is making its fifth successive appearance in these championships. That record speaks for itself.\" </p> <p>As Lemerre says, and as more than the odd pundit can testify, underestimating the Danes is not a good idea. With an audacity that had to be seen to be believed, they confounded everyone by winning the competition in 1992 after starting as 100-1 outsiders and, indeed, being invited to make up the numbers in sweden only because Yugoslavia had been barred from competing at the last minute. Furthermore, their record against France is good, winning four of their last seven games. </p> <p>If lavish servings of humble pie are to be dished up again, however, they will need to find a star from somewhere. Otherwise, booking the flight home is almost certain to be Bo Johansson's final act after four years as national coach. The Swede's contract runs out after the finals and Morten Olsen and Michael Laudrup are said to be waiting in the wings. </p> <p>His cause is not helped by an injury crisis which could leave him with only 15 players to choose from. Only Rene Henriksen of the first-choice defence is likely to play. </p> <p>\"It will take something special for us to go through,\" admitted Johansson. \"This is definitely the hardest of all the groups and we are classed as one of the weaker teams in the competition.\" </p> <p>Even if the Laudrup brothers have long since departed, Peter Schmeichel remains very much a part of the furniture. And with Fabien Barthez in the French goal, the contest between Manchester United's custodians past and present will provide an intriguing sub-plot to the main event. </p> <p> <strong> Venue </strong> Jan Breydel stadium, Bruges </p> <p><strong> Kick-off </strong> 5pm BST </p> <p><strong> Referee </strong> G\u00fcnter Benk\u00f6 </p> <p>(Austria) </p> <p><strong> Record</strong> France 3 wins; Denmark 5 wins; 1 draw </p> <p><strong> Television</strong> </p> <p>Live on ITV from 4.30pm.

      "bodyText": "Every tournament must have a Group of Death and Euro 2000 will be no different from the norm. This year's is, logically enough, Group D but one suspects it will take something altogether more dastardly to squeeze the life out of the French. Although it required a faux pas from a Russian goalkeeper to help ensure they are here at all, France's jitters in the qualifiers are long forgotten and their status as world champions demands their inclusion among the favourites to climb the winners' podium in Rotterdam on July 2. With the Czechs and Dutch to come in a group comprising four previous winners, the natural assumption is that tomorrow's Danish fare inside the Jan Breydel stadium will probably be their least demanding exercise. It would be hard to argue otherwise. Much, of course, could depend on Nicolas Anelka being in the right form (not to mention frame of mind) but Les Bleus have other attacking options even if their young and frequently misguided striker decides to throw one of his wobblies. Thierry Henry's surge of form after overcoming his teething problems at Arsenal should justify a first-team place, especially with Christophe Dugarry suspended, while behind him remain many of the usual suspects from France 98. Indeed, if continuity breeds success, then France must already be halfway there. Their coach Roger Lemerre was Aim\u00e9 Jacquet's right-hand man in the World Cup and no fewer than 18 members of his squad were involved two years ago. Zinedine Zidane has been strangely overlooked among the nominations for the tournament's most likely stars but the former world and European footballer of the year is still a force to be reckoned with and, if Didier Deschamps continues to wilt, this could finally be the chance for Patrick Vieira to prove his international worth. \"This set of players won the World Cup, so there is no reason why we cannot win the European Championship,\" Lemerre said yesterday. \"We will travel to Bruges with a lot of confidence but a lot of humility as well, for we are facing a side that is making its fifth successive appearance in these championships. That record speaks for itself.\" As Lemerre says, and as more than the odd pundit can testify, underestimating the Danes is not a good idea. With an audacity that had to be seen to be believed, they confounded everyone by winning the competition in 1992 after starting as 100-1 outsiders and, indeed, being invited to make up the numbers in sweden only because Yugoslavia had been barred from competing at the last minute. Furthermore, their record against France is good, winning four of their last seven games. If lavish servings of humble pie are to be dished up again, however, they will need to find a star from somewhere. Otherwise, booking the flight home is almost certain to be Bo Johansson's final act after four years as national coach. The Swede's contract runs out after the finals and Morten Olsen and Michael Laudrup are said to be waiting in the wings. His cause is not helped by an injury crisis which could leave him with only 15 players to choose from. Only Rene Henriksen of the first-choice defence is likely to play. \"It will take something special for us to go through,\" admitted Johansson. \"This is definitely the hardest of all the groups and we are classed as one of the weaker teams in the competition.\" Even if the Laudrup brothers have long since departed, Peter Schmeichel remains very much a part of the furniture. And with Fabien Barthez in the French goal, the contest between Manchester United's custodians past and present will provide an intriguing sub-plot to the main event.

      "body": "<p><strong> Lord Hattersley</strong> </p> <p> Former Labour deputy leader </p> <p> My tip for Euro 2000 is <strong> England,</strong> a prediction I can easily justify. I used to be a politician and I recognise the penalties of not sounding patriotic. So I have blocked out of my mind England's appalling record in the qualifying matches, the weakness on the left side of the pitch , and the fear that Shearer is losing his pace and that Beckham will lose his temper. Were it not for my obligation to support the mother country I would put my imaginary bet on France. If Nicolas Anelka - as talented as he is intolerable - begins to perform I would have no doubt I would win. </p> <p> <strong> George Best</strong> </p> <p> Legend </p> <p> I'm backing <strong> Spain</strong> and <strong> Holland</strong> . I know the Spanish have continually bottled it when it comes to the major tournaments but the talent in their squad is frightening and if they don't do it this time you feel they never will. As for the Dutch, they spend more time fighting one another than the opposition but if home advantage counts for anything they must go close. </p> <p> <strong> Marjan Setinc</strong> </p> <p> Slovenian ambassador to Britain </p> <p> I only say Slovenia will win Euro 2000 because I am the ambassador. In reality <strong> Spain</strong> are probably favourites but only just. Having had three teams in the Champions League semi-finals, and with a number of home-grown players in each, they just have the edge over other teams. But there is less difference between the teams than there used to be. </p> <p> <strong> Rachel Anderson</strong> </p> <p> Football agent </p> <p> I'd like to think it would be England but to be honest I think it's got a good chance of being <strong> Holland</strong> , if only because of the great influence of playing on home territory. These things tend to go in cycles, don't they, and I know Holland have been working really hard after going through a bad spell. </p> <p> <strong> Franz Beckenbauer</strong> </p> <p> Germany's former captain and coach, president of Bayern Munich </p> <p> <strong> Germany</strong> are capable of defending our title successfully, not because we will make spectacular progress but because the other teams are not better than we are. France, Italy and England all experienced difficulties in qualifying as well. Somehow we're in the same situation as after the 1994 World Cup: we were knocked out [in the quarter-finals] and after that Berti Vogts managed to win the 1996 European title. </p> <p> <strong> Phil Cornwell</strong> </p> <p> Comedian and star of BBC2's Stella Street </p> <p> Turkey. You'd be laughing the other side of your face if it was them come July. Logically you'd have to fancy Holland: home advantage, good players, technically excellent. But I can't look much further than <strong> Germany</strong> . I know everyone's writing them off but they're big, athletic, determined. Plus they always win in the end. Pity England-Germany is in the group stage. Course that could be the final. But you can't see England there, can you? </p> <p> <strong> Antonio Pinto</strong> </p> <p> Three times winner of the London marathon </p> <p> Naturally I want Portugal to win but there are a lot of other very good candidates. If I had to put money on one team it would be <strong> Holland</strong> , who will have the support of the home crowds firmly behind them. </p> <p> <strong> Jim Smith</strong> </p> <p> Derby County manager </p> <p> I saw <strong> France</strong> beat Croatia the other night and they were playing with a lot of confidence and arrogance. They can be tremendous in attack and they would be my favourites. The Spaniards have had a great season at club level so they would be my second tip but there is always that nagging doubt about them being bad travellers. </p> <p> <strong> Ian Rush</strong> </p> <p> Former Liverpool, Juventus and Wales striker </p> <p> I've seen Holland quoted at 3-1 but for me the best odds are <strong> Italy</strong> at 8-1. They are always there or thereabouts and losing to Norway last weekend might just work in their favour. After them I would say Holland. They have the home advantage but a lot depends on how Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert play. Bergkamp has not had the best season but I'm sure he will do well. </p> <p> <strong> Kevin Day</strong> </p> <p> Comedian and TV host </p> <p> <strong> Spain</strong> . If only because I've been predicting they'll win a major tournament ever since I could talk and the law of averages suggest I must get it right eventually. They've always flattered to deceive but this time I think their fantastic club form will be something for them to fall back on. But I think Tore Andre Flo will be the top scorer. </p> <p> <strong> Tim Foster</strong> </p> <p> Member of the British Olympic coxless four </p> <p> I fancy <strong> Spain</strong> . They were hard done by in 1996 when they outplayed England, had a bona fide goal ruled out and lost on penalties. They have quality throughout the side and Raul up front is unpredictable and creative and my idea of the star of the championship. I'm worried for England. They are a team without stars, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. If Sol Campbell finds some form that could be the key, but as a Spurs fan I would say that, wouldn't I? </p> <p> <strong> Matt Elliott</strong> </p> <p> Leicester and Scotland defender </p> <p> There are probably 12 teams with a realistic chance, including England, but I just fancy this could be <strong> Spain</strong> 's year. It's strange that they never seem to do it in major competitions but they dominated the Champions League. Other than them it is difficult to see past France and Holland. </p> <p> <strong> Keith Allen</strong> </p> <p> Comedian, actor and founder member of Fat Les, whose single Jerusalem is the official England Euro 2000 song </p> <p> <strong> England</strong> can go all the way and will probably get at least to the semi-finals. From then on it's up to the countenance divine.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lord Hattersley Former Labour deputy leader My tip for Euro 2000 is England, a prediction I can easily justify. I used to be a politician and I recognise the penalties of not sounding patriotic. So I have blocked out of my mind England's appalling record in the qualifying matches, the weakness on the left side of the pitch , and the fear that Shearer is losing his pace and that Beckham will lose his temper. Were it not for my obligation to support the mother country I would put my imaginary bet on France. If Nicolas Anelka - as talented as he is intolerable - begins to perform I would have no doubt I would win. George Best Legend I'm backing Spain and Holland . I know the Spanish have continually bottled it when it comes to the major tournaments but the talent in their squad is frightening and if they don't do it this time you feel they never will. As for the Dutch, they spend more time fighting one another than the opposition but if home advantage counts for anything they must go close. Marjan Setinc Slovenian ambassador to Britain I only say Slovenia will win Euro 2000 because I am the ambassador. In reality Spain are probably favourites but only just. Having had three teams in the Champions League semi-finals, and with a number of home-grown players in each, they just have the edge over other teams. But there is less difference between the teams than there used to be. Rachel Anderson Football agent I'd like to think it would be England but to be honest I think it's got a good chance of being Holland , if only because of the great influence of playing on home territory. These things tend to go in cycles, don't they, and I know Holland have been working really hard after going through a bad spell. Franz Beckenbauer Germany's former captain and coach, president of Bayern Munich Germany are capable of defending our title successfully, not because we will make spectacular progress but because the other teams are not better than we are. France, Italy and England all experienced difficulties in qualifying as well. Somehow we're in the same situation as after the 1994 World Cup: we were knocked out [in the quarter-finals] and after that Berti Vogts managed to win the 1996 European title. Phil Cornwell Comedian and star of BBC2's Stella Street Turkey. You'd be laughing the other side of your face if it was them come July. Logically you'd have to fancy Holland: home advantage, good players, technically excellent. But I can't look much further than Germany . I know everyone's writing them off but they're big, athletic, determined. Plus they always win in the end. Pity England-Germany is in the group stage. Course that could be the final. But you can't see England there, can you? Antonio Pinto Three times winner of the London marathon Naturally I want Portugal to win but there are a lot of other very good candidates. If I had to put money on one team it would be Holland , who will have the support of the home crowds firmly behind them. Jim Smith Derby County manager I saw France beat Croatia the other night and they were playing with a lot of confidence and arrogance. They can be tremendous in attack and they would be my favourites. The Spaniards have had a great season at club level so they would be my second tip but there is always that nagging doubt about them being bad travellers. Ian Rush Former Liverpool, Juventus and Wales striker I've seen Holland quoted at 3-1 but for me the best odds are Italy at 8-1. They are always there or thereabouts and losing to Norway last weekend might just work in their favour. After them I would say Holland. They have the home advantage but a lot depends on how Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert play. Bergkamp has not had the best season but I'm sure he will do well. Kevin Day Comedian and TV host Spain . If only because I've been predicting they'll win a major tournament ever since I could talk and the law of averages suggest I must get it right eventually. They've always flattered to deceive but this time I think their fantastic club form will be something for them to fall back on. But I think Tore Andre Flo will be the top scorer. Tim Foster Member of the British Olympic coxless four I fancy Spain . They were hard done by in 1996 when they outplayed England, had a bona fide goal ruled out and lost on penalties. They have quality throughout the side and Raul up front is unpredictable and creative and my idea of the star of the championship. I'm worried for England. They are a team without stars, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. If Sol Campbell finds some form that could be the key, but as a Spurs fan I would say that, wouldn't I? Matt Elliott Leicester and Scotland defender There are probably 12 teams with a realistic chance, including England, but I just fancy this could be Spain 's year. It's strange that they never seem to do it in major competitions but they dominated the Champions League. Other than them it is difficult to see past France and Holland. Keith Allen Comedian, actor and founder member of Fat Les, whose single Jerusalem is the official England Euro 2000 song England can go all the way and will probably get at least to the semi-finals. From then on it's up to the countenance divine.",

Will this be a draw like so many opening games?<br><strong>2</strong> Kennet Andersson tries to break the deadlock early with a rasping shot from the right well saved by De Wilde.<br><strong>4</strong> Belgium break sharply from defence, looking confident and fluid in coming forward. Wilmots and Goor combine well and the cross from the left doesn't do justice to the smooth build-up play. Encouraging signs for the home side though.<br><strong>6</strong> First set-piece for Sweden, 25 yards out centre-right. Patrik Andersson drives the ball low to De Wilde's right-hand upright, and a Belgian defender gets the slightest of touches to force a corner. The centre is cleared by Valgaeren, and the home supporters can breathe again.<br><strong>8</strong> Staelens saves Belgian blushes by intercepting Alexandersson's header through for Petterson, with only De Wilde to beat.<br><strong>9</strong> Kennet Andersson and most of Sweden start to celebrate as his header arrows goalwards from the corner, but the effort is a hair's breadth wide and De Wilde's heart can start beating again.<br><strong>10</strong> Something for the home supporters to cheer about after a breathless ten minutes. Mpenza (E) wriggles his way between to defenders to latch onto a through-ball, only to be ruled offside. He looks like a handful though, and will continue to cause Sweden problems at the back.<br><strong>12</strong> A corner to Belgium, from the right, hit to the far post and headed away by Bjorklund. The Swedes look more comfortable against the Belgian aerial threat than the other way around. The clearance is fed to Petterson, who looked to be tugged back in the Belgian area, but the referee listens to the crowd and is unmoved.<br><strong>14</strong> Wilmots, in a little space on the right, almost finds Branco Strupar with a lobbed through-ball. The Belgian striker just fails to control the ball over his shoulder and a relieved Hedman collects.<br><strong>17</strong> Strupar again the target as Belgium enjoy a good spell of attacking play. The Derby County man collects a chest-high pass with his back to the area 25 yards out, and swivels and hits a rising volley in one movement. A little too rising, but good skill nonetheless. Goal kick.<br><strong>19</strong> Real end-to-end stuff as Petterson is almost played through to the Belgian goal. De Wilde clears upfield and the ball is nodded on to Strupar, who is crowded out by Nilsson. Goal kick.<br><strong>22</strong> A free kick to Belgium, won by Wilmots' determination. All of 35 yards out on the right, Strupar meets the set-piece centre with a header but his effort does not threaten Hedman thanks to Mellberg's challenge.<br><strong>24</strong> Wilmots almost opens the scoring for Belgium, with a late run to meet a cross from the right. His diving header was slightly mis-timed, and Hedman is lucky o collect the ball which trickles into his arms. The Belgian midfielder knows that it was a good chance. <br><strong>25</strong> A corner to Sweden from the left. De Wilde shows confidence to coming for a deep cross and plucking it off Petterson's head. Belgium then break upfield and Verheyen, in a lot of space, can only blaze his shot well over the bar from 25 yards.<br><strong>28</strong> Another corner for Sweden, again from the left, again from Petterson and again claimed by De Wilde at the far post. Something tells me the Swedes should vary their delivery somewhat.<br><strong>30</strong> Sweden are making a lot of use of Hedman's prodigious length from clearances. His kicks are travelling three-quarters of the length of the pitch and causing havoc in the Belgian defence. Again Petterson just fails to latch onto another Hedman Howitzer.<br><strong>31</strong> A mis-kick from Andersson (P) lets in Mpenza (E) down the right. His cutback is aimed at Wilmots, who scuffs his shot into a Swedish defender and the momentum is lost.<br><strong>34</strong> A tackle from behind by Staelens leaves Petterson poleaxed 25 yards out on the right. The centre disappoints, hit straight at De Wilde.<br><strong>37</strong> A defensive lapse by Sweden sees the ball fall to Strupar halfway into the Swedish half. With passing options left and right, the Belgian opts to drive the ball gently into Hedman's arms.<br><strong>38</strong> Ljundberg breathes a sigh of relief as his positioning on the right flank almost leads to a Belgian goal. Vanderhaege, in the space the Arsenal man has afforded him, crosses to the far post and finds Mpenza rising to meet the ball. His header is firm but high. Hedman glares at Ljundberg.<br><strong>41</strong> Good skill by Ljundberg to turn his man on a sixpence and drive towards goal. His pace takes him to within 20 yards on the centre-right, but the low drive is straight at De Wilde.<br><strong>43 GOAL! Belgium 1 - 0 Sweden</strong> Nilsson, after doing very little wrong for 42 minutes, has a momentary lapse that lets in Bart Goor on the left. The winger's pace takes him past Bjorklund in the area, and the low shot beats Hedman at his near post. Everyone, bar eleven Swedes, go nuts.<br><strong>46</strong> Half time: Belgium 1 - 0 Sweden.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Belgium restart the match. Sweden have <strong>substituted</strong> the unfortunate Nilsson for Lucic.<br><strong>46 GOAL! Belgium 2 - 0 Sweden</strong> Mpenza, fed by a chested ball from Strupar past the stranded Lucic, drives an unstoppable shot past Hedman and into the top corner from 20 yards on the left. A great, great shot worthy of a daft celebration, which Mpenza duly provides.<br><strong>48</strong> It is all Belgium at the moment - wave after wave of the Red Devils are raining down on the Swedish defence, which is looking really shaken up.<br><strong>50</strong> Sweden call in the cavalry, <strong>substituting</strong> Petterson for Larsson.<br> <strong>52</strong> Larsson wins a corner on the left. The set-piece is played short and flicked on by Larsson, into the arms of De Wilde.<br><strong>53 GOAL! Belgium 2 - 1 Sweden</strong> All of Mjallby's Christmases and birthdays come at once as De Wilde, collecting a routine back-pass from Deflandre, steps on the ball and then promptly falls over it to gift the Sweden and Celtic striker a tap in to an open goal. A glimmer of hope for Sweden, then.<br><strong>57</strong> Ljundberg almost makes it a dream five minutes for Sweden. An Andersson through-ball is too much for the Belgian offside trap, and Freddy races clear towards De Wilde. The Belgian keeper is slow to come off his line and lucky to save with his legs when Ljundberg should have scored. So close.<br><strong>59</strong> Mjallby, Sweden's newest hero, is the latest Swede to beat the home side's shaky offside trap. Clean through on De Wilde's goal centre-right, he cuts back and then waits long enough for Valgaeren to tackle him. Even he looks baffled with what he was trying to do.<br><strong>64</strong> Staelens, shadowing Larsson on the right, bundles his charge over 25 yards out. The free kick is curled by Kennet Andersson, right footed and curling into De Wilde's near post. The wall ensures that the shot lacks the necessary bend. Goal kick.<br><strong>66</strong> A clumsy challenge by Verheyen on the left earns him a <strong>booking</strong>. The free kick, 10 yards in from the touchline and 35 yards out, is floated harmlessly into the Belgian area and cleared with aplomb.<br><strong>68</strong> Great play from Verheyen on the right earns Belgium a corner. A the centre is overhit and played back in. Hedman comes to claim and makes a hash of it, but the referee feels some sympathy and is blowing his whistle as Mpenza rolls the ball into the net. Free kick.<br><strong>69</strong> The Belgians make their first change of the night - Nilis comes on as a <strong>substitute</strong> for Strupar. Sweden follow suit with their last change; Daniel Andersson off for Osmanovski.<br><strong>72</strong> A corner to Sweden from the left. De Wilde comes and flaps. Kennet Andersson gets a head to it but Belgium manage to get he ball clear.<br><strong>74</strong> Belgium's build-up play has been looking more and more impressive the longer the game has continued. Luc Nilis, released on the right, fires in an outswinging cross picked up by Goor, who draws a foul from Ljundberg. The set-piece, where both sides have disappointed, is another weak affair, driven straight into the wall from 25 yards centre-left.<br><strong>74</strong> Luc Nilis clips Ljundberg's heels an sends him down in font of the referee. Unsurprisingly, he is <strong>booked</strong>.<br><strong>80 Sent off</strong> Patrik Andersson, booked in the first half, clips Goor late and in full flight on the left. The referee has no choice but to show the <strong>red card</strong> and no one really complains, not even Andersson himself. Big winnings for those who chose under on the re card spread-bet then. Nilis curls the free kick precisely onto the roof of the net.<br><strong>83</strong> Nilis, enjoying the space available late in the game and against ten men, break down the right ad with two team-mates screaming for the ball around the penalty spot, he calmly lobs the ball over Hedman's bar. His manager must be frothing at the mouth.<br><strong>87</strong> Alexandersson, with a free kick in a central position 50 yards out, finds the head of Mjallby on the left of the Belgian area. His header is powerful and well directed, and De Wilde is forced to tip the effort over the bar.<br><strong>88</strong> After much messing around due to cramp and the like, a corner to Sweden from the left. A curling, far post centre aimed at Larsson coming round the back is caught by the feline De Wilde, who seems to have all his confidence back.<br><strong>90</strong> Four extra minutes to play, All that writhing around with 'cramp' does you no good, you see.<br><strong>92</strong> So much space now for Belgium to run at Sweden. Mpenza traps and turns on the left, feeding Wilmots with a lay-off. The midfielder strikes it first-time, 25 yards out centre-right. Wide and poor pretty much describes the result.<br><strong>94</strong> Full time: Belgium 2 - 1 Sweden.<br></p>",

If the unmistakable air of resignation engulfing most of his compatriots is an accurate gauge, he should not fret if his betting slip goes through the wash.</p> <p>\"We know that no one is giving us a chance,\" the national coach Robert Waseige sighed yesterday. \"Sometimes when I listen to the people it is as though we are not even involved.\"</p> <p>All this pessimism, yet Belgium's pre-tournament results are not to be sniffed at. Of their eight matches under Waseige they have lost only to England and have beaten Norway 2-0 and Italy 3-1 on their travels.</p> <p>Even so there has been a conspicuous lack of tub-thumping at their training base this week. Only a few weeks since predicting a place in the final, Belgium's player of the year Lorenzo Staelens is backtracking at a steady rate, saying: \"We just aren't strong enough.\" Even Waseige admits that their record in major tournaments is very ordinary. \"I cannot tell you the reason but we cannot escape the facts.\"</p> <p>At the age of 60, having been out of work for the best part of 18 months after parting company with Charleroi and with a curriculum vitae containing a handful of promotions but only the 1990 Belgian Cup with FC Liege, Waseige's appointment last August was curious to say the least. A bit like giving Lawrie McMenemy the England job.</p> <p>Initially there was a tidal wave of scepticism but Waseige first set about winning over his players, then the Flemish media, and has accomplished both. There was even a smattering of applause when he appeared before the press yesterday.</p> <p>Such has been the national side's recent transformation that Luc Nilis has been tempted out of international retirement, having previously stated he was unavailable because of the \"unworkable\" regime of Waseige's predecessor Georges Leekens.</p> <p>An Aston Villa player come July 1, Nilis needs a good tournament to justify his inclusion in the squad ahead of Westerlo's Toni Brogno, last season's joint leading scorer in the Jupiler league with 30 goals.</p> <p>\"I would not have played for Belgium again if it were not for the coach,\" says Nilis, who scored 18 alongside Ruud van Nistelrooy at PSV Eindhoven last season.</p> <p>\"Not so long ago I would have laughed if people said I would be playing in these championships. But since the change of manager there is a new sense of togetherness and I want to be part of it.</p> <p>\"People are saying we have no chance, but the hosts always tend to do well in major competitions. Just look at France in the last World Cup: they were not fancied but they emerged as the best team.\"</p> <p>Since Belgium lost to West Germany 2-1 in the 1980 European Championship final, two decades of less-than-heroic failure have cultivated the suspicion that they would probably not be in this tournament but for their automatic qualification by virtue of being co-hosts.</p> <p>And, with Enzo Scifo past his sell-by date, the checklist of Belgian players is unlikely to have spectators rushing to the King Baudouin stadium here this evening.</p> <p>The Diables Rouges will be confronted by a Sweden team who finished top of England's qualifying group, conceding only one goal.</p> <p>\"They have shown that they are a tough side but we have the crowd on our side and we must use that to our advantage,\" says Belgium's captain Marc Wilmots. \"It is a good game for us to start our championships.\"</p> <p>Waseige, the first Walloon to manage his national team, has as his main problem something Keegan can only dream about: an excess of left-sided players. One such, the winger-cum-attacker Bart Goor, is worth watching but Belgium are unlikely to score many goals; the Croatia-born Branko Strupar of Derby County and Schalke 04's livewire Emile Mpenza, or Mr 1000 Volts as he is known to his team-mates, will start in the strikers' roles, with the former PSV team-mates Gilles de Bilde and Nilis in reserve.</p> <p>If the lack of star quality troubles Waseige he conceals it well. \"We do not have glory-hunters and nor do we want them,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We have a group of players who are willing to work as a team rather than individuals. Despite everything that has been said, they know there will never be a better chance for Belgium to win this competition.</p> <p>\"It does not matter that my players are not as well known as those from Italy, Holland and England. Perhaps people will be able to name them better in a few weeks. And, besides, don't people always say it is impossible to name famous Belgians?\"</p> <p>Indeed they do. \"It has become something of an international joke,\" scowls Marc Tielemans, editor of the Famous Belgians website. \"People are always asking the same question so I started the definitive list. I find that five examples normally shut them up.\"</p> <p>Only time will tell whether Belgium's Euro 2000 justifies Waseige's inclusion, but a nation is not holding its breath.</p> <p> <strong> Venue </strong> King Baudouin stadium, Brussels</p> <p><strong> Kick-off </strong> 7.45pm BST</p> <p><strong> Referee </strong> Markus Merk (Germany)</p> <p><strong> Record</strong> Belgium 5 wins; Sweden 5 wins; 2 draws</p> <p><strong> Television</strong> </p> <p>Live on ITV from 7pm and Eurosport from 7.30pm.

If the unmistakable air of resignation engulfing most of his compatriots is an accurate gauge, he should not fret if his betting slip goes through the wash. \"We know that no one is giving us a chance,\" the national coach Robert Waseige sighed yesterday. \"Sometimes when I listen to the people it is as though we are not even involved.\" All this pessimism, yet Belgium's pre-tournament results are not to be sniffed at. Of their eight matches under Waseige they have lost only to England and have beaten Norway 2-0 and Italy 3-1 on their travels. Even so there has been a conspicuous lack of tub-thumping at their training base this week. Only a few weeks since predicting a place in the final, Belgium's player of the year Lorenzo Staelens is backtracking at a steady rate, saying: \"We just aren't strong enough.\" Even Waseige admits that their record in major tournaments is very ordinary. \"I cannot tell you the reason but we cannot escape the facts.\" At the age of 60, having been out of work for the best part of 18 months after parting company with Charleroi and with a curriculum vitae containing a handful of promotions but only the 1990 Belgian Cup with FC Liege, Waseige's appointment last August was curious to say the least. A bit like giving Lawrie McMenemy the England job. Initially there was a tidal wave of scepticism but Waseige first set about winning over his players, then the Flemish media, and has accomplished both. There was even a smattering of applause when he appeared before the press yesterday. Such has been the national side's recent transformation that Luc Nilis has been tempted out of international retirement, having previously stated he was unavailable because of the \"unworkable\" regime of Waseige's predecessor Georges Leekens. An Aston Villa player come July 1, Nilis needs a good tournament to justify his inclusion in the squad ahead of Westerlo's Toni Brogno, last season's joint leading scorer in the Jupiler league with 30 goals. \"I would not have played for Belgium again if it were not for the coach,\" says Nilis, who scored 18 alongside Ruud van Nistelrooy at PSV Eindhoven last season. \"Not so long ago I would have laughed if people said I would be playing in these championships. But since the change of manager there is a new sense of togetherness and I want to be part of it. \"People are saying we have no chance, but the hosts always tend to do well in major competitions. Just look at France in the last World Cup: they were not fancied but they emerged as the best team.\" Since Belgium lost to West Germany 2-1 in the 1980 European Championship final, two decades of less-than-heroic failure have cultivated the suspicion that they would probably not be in this tournament but for their automatic qualification by virtue of being co-hosts. And, with Enzo Scifo past his sell-by date, the checklist of Belgian players is unlikely to have spectators rushing to the King Baudouin stadium here this evening. The Diables Rouges will be confronted by a Sweden team who finished top of England's qualifying group, conceding only one goal. \"They have shown that they are a tough side but we have the crowd on our side and we must use that to our advantage,\" says Belgium's captain Marc Wilmots. \"It is a good game for us to start our championships.\" Waseige, the first Walloon to manage his national team, has as his main problem something Keegan can only dream about: an excess of left-sided players. One such, the winger-cum-attacker Bart Goor, is worth watching but Belgium are unlikely to score many goals; the Croatia-born Branko Strupar of Derby County and Schalke 04's livewire Emile Mpenza, or Mr 1000 Volts as he is known to his team-mates, will start in the strikers' roles, with the former PSV team-mates Gilles de Bilde and Nilis in reserve. If the lack of star quality troubles Waseige he conceals it well. \"We do not have glory-hunters and nor do we want them,\" he says. \"We have a group of players who are willing to work as a team rather than individuals. Despite everything that has been said, they know there will never be a better chance for Belgium to win this competition. \"It does not matter that my players are not as well known as those from Italy, Holland and England. Perhaps people will be able to name them better in a few weeks. And, besides, don't people always say it is impossible to name famous Belgians?\" Indeed they do. \"It has become something of an international joke,\" scowls Marc Tielemans, editor of the Famous Belgians website. \"People are always asking the same question so I started the definitive list. I find that five examples normally shut them up.\" Only time will tell whether Belgium's Euro 2000 justifies Waseige's inclusion, but a nation is not holding its breath.

The locals believe the future's bright, the future's Oranje. </p> <p>The Czechs, though, deserve respect. They are flattered by the statistics (third in Fifa's rankings, 10 wins out of 10 in qualifying and those silver medals). But their resilient, skilful players are no pushovers, even after a bad night's sleep. In England they came through a group containing Italy, Germany and Russia. They fancy a repeat. </p> <p>\"People don't expect us to get through but inside we believe we can do it,\" said Pavel Srnicek, the No1 keeper despite not being an automatic choice for Sheffield Wednesday. \"After Euro 96 a lot of the players moved to big European clubs and we have the quality and experience of that.\" </p> <p>Srnicek admits he would settle for a point tomorrow, and a 1-1 draw in Eindhoven in a friendly last November gives cause for hope. The balding, towering Koller scored that day and gave Jaap Stam a tough time. Perhaps Holland should use the Amsterdam Arena's retractable roof to make the 27-year-old play with a stoop. </p> <p>Since his debut 16 months ago Koller has established himself as an international giant in more ways than one. His 14 appearances have yielded 13 goals. Not bad for someone sold by Sparta Prague to Lokeren for around \u00a370,000. Anderlecht paid nearer \u00a33m last year. </p> <p>\"Jan is strong but also fast and good with his feet,\" Srnicek said. \"Some people treat him as a joke because of how he looks but he's a quality player. He's a key man in attacking and defending free- kicks and when we're under pressure he can hold up the ball and lay it off. That's what you need against teams like Holland. They are at home so they have to attack. Maybe this will work to our advantage and we can sneak one or two.\" </p> <p>The Dutch have a tendency to lose concentration but their greater quality and attacking pace should see them through. Marc Overmars is expected to recover from injury and could prosper if the Czechs field the inexperienced defenders Petr Gabriel and Milan Fukal. Jozef Chovanec's side are definitely without Patrik Berger, who begins a two-match ban. \"It will not be easy to fill that gap,\" the coach said. </p> <p>Presumably it was not Chovanec in the helicopter spotted above one of Holland's private training sessions yesterday. But if Frank Rijkaard is keeping much to himself he had good news for a public who want sexy football, albeit a more successful version than Ruud Gullit gave Newcastle. </p> <p>\"We know the Dutch want to win in a certain manner,\" he said. \"Beautiful football is one of the objectives. If we play attractive football we give our selves more chances but effectiveness is vital too. There are certain teams that play in a defensive way but there will be a time when they have to come out and play. That's when we can benefit.\" </p> <p>Chovanec, a former PSV Eindhoven player, does not have a reputation for negativity. He will look to his playmaker Pavel Nedved of Lazio, whose battle with Edgar Davids promises to be critical. The Dutch hope Davids can run a midfield as well as he apparently runs through buildings. A skyscraper in Rotterdam, pictured on page one, shows him charging through one side and emerging the other. </p> <p>For Nedved the biggest worry seemed to be the referee Pierluigi Collina. He and Tomas Repka, the Fiorentina defender, have been sent off three times between them in Italy, on each occasion by Collina for dissent. \"He is smiling and laughing with players,\" Repka said, \"and suddenly he plunges the knife in your back.\" </p> <p>Of course the knives will be out for Rijkaard if he fails. He said he would stress to his defence the need for communication but will not announce the team to his players until tomorrow. \"I think it should be made at the last minute,\" he said. \"It gives a little extra tension. I also don't see any advantage in saying it now.\" </p> <p>Too often the Dutch have struggled to turn superiority into victory under Rijkaard, winning only four of his 17 games.

And not only in England, where the team's departure from the last three major tournaments in which they have participated has been on penalties. The Dutch have a similar record to ours - two semis and a quarter-final have been lost that way - and the Italians have contrived to lose four, including the biggest of the lot, the World Cup final of 1994, a game now remembered solely for Roberto Baggio's extravagant scoop at the last.

When ITV gleaned the biggest viewing figures in its history for the England-Argentina match at the last World Cup, the 28m were assembled in their front rooms only for the 15 minutes of penalties. During much of the rest of the game almost half that number were otherwise engaged.

      "body": "<p>It could be argued that the European Championship that matters most this year has already been completed. Two and a half weeks ago Real Madrid beat Valencia in Paris to win the Champions League, a competition which now dwarfs every other tournament except the World Cup. </p> <p>The qualifying rounds for the next Champions League are only a few weeks away. In the meantime the leading players will don national costumes, stand to attention for their national anthems, make patriotic noises and try to convince themselves that winning Euro 2000 is their hearts' desire. </p> <p>Maybe, in the shorter term, it is. Remember the wild German celebrations at Wembley four years ago when Oliver Bierhoff's goal in sudden-death extra-time ended Czech resistance? </p> <p>Of course, the cynical view was that the eruption on to the pitch from the German bench helped convince the referee that it was not worth halting the hugging to consult the linesman, whose flag had been raised as the ball entered the net. Yet the German glee was genuine enough. In the end all teams like winning things. </p> <p>Nevertheless it is impossible to avoid noticing that among the 16 finalists competing in the European Championship, which starts today, few can be said to reflect either the strength of the football being played in their countries or the make-up of their best club sides. </p> <p>Take today's opening match. Only half the Belgium team play in Belgium and their most successful clubs draw heavily on foreign talent. Almost the entire Sweden side are based abroad. </p> <p>Spain and Italy will field strong line-ups drawn from their own leagues but their leading clubs are still full of imports. The strength of France, the World Cup holders, is based in England, Italy and Germany. </p> <p>England only partly represent the best of the football being played in the Premiership. True, players from Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool make up the bulk of Kevin Keegan's side but, if England were to meet a Premiership foreign XI over five games, who would win the more times? </p> <p>International football was not always cross-pollinated in this way. When West Germany and Holland met in the final of the 1974 World Cup it really was a contest between the best of what was being seen within those countries.

      "bodyText": "It could be argued that the European Championship that matters most this year has already been completed. Two and a half weeks ago Real Madrid beat Valencia in Paris to win the Champions League, a competition which now dwarfs every other tournament except the World Cup. The qualifying rounds for the next Champions League are only a few weeks away. In the meantime the leading players will don national costumes, stand to attention for their national anthems, make patriotic noises and try to convince themselves that winning Euro 2000 is their hearts' desire. Maybe, in the shorter term, it is. Remember the wild German celebrations at Wembley four years ago when Oliver Bierhoff's goal in sudden-death extra-time ended Czech resistance? Of course, the cynical view was that the eruption on to the pitch from the German bench helped convince the referee that it was not worth halting the hugging to consult the linesman, whose flag had been raised as the ball entered the net. Yet the German glee was genuine enough. In the end all teams like winning things. Nevertheless it is impossible to avoid noticing that among the 16 finalists competing in the European Championship, which starts today, few can be said to reflect either the strength of the football being played in their countries or the make-up of their best club sides. Take today's opening match. Only half the Belgium team play in Belgium and their most successful clubs draw heavily on foreign talent. Almost the entire Sweden side are based abroad. Spain and Italy will field strong line-ups drawn from their own leagues but their leading clubs are still full of imports. The strength of France, the World Cup holders, is based in England, Italy and Germany. England only partly represent the best of the football being played in the Premiership. True, players from Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool make up the bulk of Kevin Keegan's side but, if England were to meet a Premiership foreign XI over five games, who would win the more times? International football was not always cross-pollinated in this way. When West Germany and Holland met in the final of the 1974 World Cup it really was a contest between the best of what was being seen within those countries. Bayern Munich, in their own Olympic stadium, were taking on a Dutch team drawn from Ajax and Feyenoord. Yet, when the same countries met in Hamburg in the semi-finals of the 1988 European Championship, and Holland won, the Italian football headlines declared it a victory for Milan over Internazionale, who had provided the key players in each team. A consoling thought for certain England supporters is that, even if Keegan's team do not reach the final in Rotterdam, there is a fair chance that someone on the pitch will give somebody something to cheer about, even if it is only Leicester City's Muzzy Izzet sitting on the Turkey bench. The football played by England teams has never represented the best of the football being played in England.

Given the trickle of genuine foreign talent after the ban on imports was partially lifted in 1978 and the present influx post-Bosman, it is a wonder any serious-minded person gives a fig for England ever being able to reproduce the lone success of 1966 in either a World Cup or a European Championship.

Depends what's in it Antiseptic wipes and cream, plasters, crepe bandage,safety pins, scissors, paracetamol. That's the basic one. Not much good in the Matto Grosso. No, but fine for visiting most developed countries: proper medical help within 24 hours. But I'm going upcountry. More than two days from a clinic? You need a bigger kit, even in Europe and the US. Various dressings, a sling, adhesive tape, plastic gloves, stronger analgesics, a general antibiotic, water-purifying tablets. Talk to your doctor before you go. Who makes the kits? Lifesystems, Nomad, Go Travel Products are three good brands. About \u00a38 for a basic pocket pack, \u00a320 for a sterile set, \u00a340 for a mountain leader kit. And where do I get them? Boots, some chemists, specialist outdoor shops,clinics like the Royal Free Hospital Travel Health Centre in London (020-7830 2885).The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has a travel clinic and advice line (0906 7088807). So has The Scottish Centre for Infections and Environmental Health (0141- 300 1100) and Bristol Royal Infirmary (0117 9284848). And most GPs do travel clinics and immunisations.",

The villages on the western side are recognisably Greek, with tavernas along the sea edge between tall, white-painted eucalyptus trees. To the south, it begins to look like Tuscany, with lines of Mediterranean cypresses and poplars and hillsides of camomile. But the north-east corner is unique. </p> <p>The village houses have sloping stone roofs, like Cotswold cottages. They are also slightly Tyrolean, slightly Yemeni, a little like Charles Rennie Mackintosh, but unlike anything you would expect to find in Greece. Or anywhere. </p> <p>The mountains are covered in a dense forest of plane, sweet chestnut, walnut, oak and holly. There are more than 2,000 species of indigenous plants, including ferns, moss and clematis. You cannot walk far without hearing the sound of running water. The air is fresh even in August. </p> <p>By the coast, bougainvillaea grows from \"English\" lawns of grass, daisies and buttercups. Rhododendrons and camellias look happier than anywhere in mainland Europe. Roses thrive untroubled by blackfly or mildew. At Damouchari in mid-May, a magnolia grandiflora was in flower, three months out of season. </p> <p>But the best plant of all was the plane tree in the main square in Tsagarada, one of the most extraordinary plants anywhere in the world. It is said to be 1,500 years old and has a trunk more than 25ft in diameter, far wider than the largest English oak. One of its branches is propped up on a stone plinth, as though it is leaning against a bar. Contrary to the usual laws of botany, two other branches join together 20ft above the trunk to form a single, seamless arm. </p> <p>It doesn't seem like a plant at all, more like a giant cuttlefish. You can imagine it staring at you like a chess player who has just made the winning move and is waiting to see how long it takes you to realise. </p> <p>The original inhabitants of the area claimed descent from Ixion, an oak god with mistletoe genitals (although how anyone could sire children with mistletoe genitals is not clear). They worshipped the centaur in fly agaric-fuelled rituals, and their promiscuity shocked the more straitlaced Hellenes. </p> <p>The cave of the centaurs can still be found in the mountains above Milies, but few echoes remain of the early inhabitants and their bizarre cults. They were driven out in the dawn of the classical age, and the modern settlements were founded by Slavs from the north in the 6th century AD. </p> <p>Late one night, I met a large, very healthy-looking fox. But there are no longer any bears, wild boar or wolves in the forest. And definitely no centaurs. </p> <p>Unlike anywhere else in the western Mediterranean, Pelion has enjoyed 1,500 years of virtually unbroken prosperity and stability. Even the 1955 earthquake, which flattened Volos and much else besides, passed Pelion by. It is still a very affluent place. The roads are free of pot-holes. The water is safe to drink. The lavatories work. </p> <p>This is not a peasant culture. The old lady in the hills selling herbs and preserved fruit is probably the wife of the retired director-general of Greece Telecom. </p> <p>The Ottoman empire, which did so much damage to the rest of Greece, left Pelion largely alone. It became an intellectual and artistic centre, and many villages have art galleries and bohemian communities. </p> <p>On the front of the hotel in Damouchari is large banner for peace in the Balkans. The hotel's owner looks like someone from the Paris left bank in the 50s or 60s. At night, round the smouldering wood fire in the bar, he and his friends play a fusion of modern jazz and traditional Greek folk music. The garden and the bar are full of odd objects. </p> <p>The pebbles on the small beach at Damouchari are like giant mint imperials. Half an hour's walk to the south, Milopotamos is as pretty a beach as you are likely to find anywhere. On an early-summer morning, it was completely deserted. </p> <p>This is serious walking country, criss-crossed with 800km of stone-paved tracks, most of them more than 500 years old. You can hire a pro fessional guide for the day or you can take it easy and go by taxi to the next higher village, making your own way back. </p> <p>A little train, which once took olive oil and fruit to Volos, now carries tourists from Ano Lehonia to Milies (\u00a34 return). (The clocktower at Ano Lehonia showed four different times, all of them wrong.) Sadly, the engine has been converted to diesel, but the passengers no longer have to get out and push, as often used to be the case. It chugs along at 10 miles an hour, over narrow-arched viaducts and a spectacular iron bridge. When it goes through a tunnel, it feels like a fairground ghost train. </p> <p>The railway was designed by the father of Giorgio de Chirico, the great metaphysical painter and father of surrealism. As a child, he lived in a house overlooking the railway, and the train and the viaducts were recurring symbols in much of his work. </p> <p>Between 1912 and 1919, he painted a series of empty, dreamlike townscapes with arched buildings, long shadows, odd perspectives, steam trains frozen in time, clocks at unlikely times, statues and everyday objects taken out of their usual context.

Forget any preconceptions about bearded men in offensively-coloured anoraks eating Kendal mint cake. Wall climbing doesn't require you to be rugged. It takes place indoors, is safe, and will exercise all your muscles in a more natural way than pumping iron. It will also make you supple since flexibility is an integral part of climbing. </p> <p>The Castle is a Grade 2 listed pumping station in Stoke Newington leased from Thames Water. Inside, the converted structure houses a cliff, made of wooden panels coated with resin. The wall is around 40ft high and covered with holds which you use to haul - or dance, depending on your experience - your way up, as you would on a ladder. There are ropes to tie into which will hold you should you fall. Using these requires some basic training and the Castle runs courses for those who have never tried climbing before; a third of its clients are newcomers. It's the perfect way to learn the ropes in a safe environment. </p> <p>Climbing centres like the Castle have attracted more women to the sport which is rapidly losing its macho image. The Castle runs a women's group on Monday evenings. Although non-climbers think that you have to be exceptionally strong to clamber up a wall, good power-to-weight ratio and a lot of grace are more useful. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.castle-climbing.co.uk\">The Castle</a> (0208-211 7000) Green Lanes, Stoke Newington, London N4 2HA, runs an introductory course of one evening per week for four weeks for \u00a399 including equipment hire. This will give you enough expertise to use the wall in safety, but there are further courses available. Open Monday to Friday 2pm to 10pm, Saturday and Sunday 10am to 7pm. The centre has a caf\u00e9, but the local pubs aren't up to much, so try the Vietnamese restaurant Aulac in Highbury Park Road (020-7704 9187). Most cities and towns now have at least one wall. Call the <a href=\"http://www.thebmc.co.uk\">British Mountaineering Council</a> on 0161-445 4747 for more details. </p> <p><strong>Stanage</strong><br>The Peak District</p> <p>The gritstone edges of Derbyshire and Yorkshire are wild, soulful places and Stanage, a few miles west of Sheffield, is the most famous of them all. With climbs no more than 60ft high, the crag is a natural place for beginners to take their first tentative steps in the vertical without having to worry too much about never getting down again. And at over three miles long with around a thousand different routes spread along the cliff, there is plenty of room for everyone. </p> <p>Britain may not have the biggest cliffs in the world, but we certainly stuff the opposition when it comes to types of rock, and, for many climbers, gritstone is the best rock of all - rough to the touch and sculpted into bluff round shapes by the wind and rain. </p> <p>There is every kind of climbing here, from easy-angled slabs that you can pad up on your feet to jutting overhangs that require beefy arms and a very positive approach. The crag is also a magnet for \"boulderers\", the surfers of the climbing world, who eschew ropes and confine themselves to small boulders where they practise short climbs - known as \"problems\" - with Zen-like dedication. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Many indoor walls either run their own courses on crags like Stanage or can put you in touch with those who do.

Alternatively, you can approach a local climbing club. The British Mountaineering Council holds a list of those in you area (0161-445 4747). Many climbers at Stanage use Longland's caf\u00e9 in Hathersage to eat, but it's also worth taking a trip into central Sheffield for a curry at Nirmals (0114 2724054). </p> <p><strong>Chair Ladder</strong><br>Cornwall</p> <p> The other area of climbing where Britain leads the world comes courtesy of the Northern Atlantic. The west coast, from Cape Cornwall to Cape Wrath, bristles with sea-cliffs and those in Cornwall are among the most popular. Chair Ladder on the southern coast of West Penwith is about as far west as you can get and, with the base of the cliff washed by high tide, it has a wild atmosphere, the ocean at your back adding an extra dimension to the experience. </p> <p>Although its position above the sea can seem intimidating, especially to novices, Chair Ladder has a host of easier climbs, and the rough granite is full of holds for your hands and feet. It's the best place in Britain to start sea-cliff climbing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chair Ladder is near the village of Porthgwarra where there is a caf\u00e9.

Rising straight out of the ocean, the main ridge is some eight miles long, never drops below 2,500ft and has more than 20 tops over 3,000ft. A traverse, usually requiring a very long day, is a major undertaking for an experienced party, but you can hire a guide or content yourself with climbing parts of it, like the huge crags at Sron na Ciche and the bizarre pinnacle of the Cioch. There are much harder climbs but the Cuillins are real mountains and full of danger. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Isle of Skye is a nine-hour drive from London or two hours from Inverness Airport. There are many qualified mountain guides in north-west Scotland - those carrying the IFMGA carnet - available at the <a href=\"http://www.bmg.org.uk\">British Mountain Guides website</a>.

      "body": "<p>William the Conqueror, hell bent in 1066 on East Sussex, meant to set sail from Normandy, but bad weather drove him north. Huddled in the mouth of the Somme, the ambitious descendant of the Vikings regrouped to sail across La Manche. </p> <p>Crossings of the English Channel, as we prefer to call it, pepper our literature and history. Armies used it through the Hundred Years' War. Smugglers use it still. Dickens' heroine in A Tale of Two Cities has a nightmare crossing. Agatha Christie's characters drive long-nosed Thirties' tourers on to ferries. Hitler established a submarine fleet at Boulogne. My mother, as a schoolgirl, was one of the civilians evacuated in the 1939 phoney war, taken in a tiny fishing boat from St Malo. </p> <p>If the gods are against us, we may still experience the thrills of early travellers. A force nine gale can make a rough 90 minutes out of even the shortest route, Dover to Calais. A couple of times a summer, ferocious weather turns that into 17 or so hours, with the ferry unable to dock. </p> <p>For the most part, though, the Channel is more a challenge to the ticket-bargain instinct than to sea legs, with the Great British holidaymaker facing a minefield of deals. The last decade has been dominated by the end of duty-free sales. Price rises did not immediately follow rationalisation of Customs' duties since the operators pegged them to retain passengers. This year, the effect is showing, with rises of up to 27% across all companies. However, competition for travellers remains fierce so there are deals. </p> <p>The mechanics are worth a thought. Choice one is which drive you prefer in England. Dover or Folkestone is fine from London, but from Birmingham or Liverpool or Glasgow then Newhaven, Southampton and Portsmouth may be attractive. Choice two is the Chunnel or a ferry. If you get sea sick, choose the Chunnel. If you are claustrophobic, the ferry. For the rest, planning starts with deciding what best suits your party and your pocket, remembering that road miles stack up pounds in petrol plus nervous strain. If you want an overnight port-side stop, choose France. Hotels are cheaper. </p> <p>Personally, looking for a speedy arrival near or north of Calais, I go for the tunnel. I prefer 30 minutes' reading the paper in my car in a Chunnel train to 90 minutes on a ferry. The odd tenner is worth it to avoid the nag from the kids about on-board special offers. </p> <p>Said kids, however, like the ferry, games machines and all, especially if there is a McDonald's. For the disabled and those with young children, the tunnel comes with the benefit of no staircases, although ferries provide help and, if forewarned, load people needing access first. For pet owners, with quaran tine relaxation, the Chunnel is probably better than leaving Fido inside the car in the hold. Some ferries will take animals, some not, but hold travel is normal and can be hot, noisy and frightening. </p> <p>P&amp;O has Conran restaurants, where the food is passable and adults can eat in peace while the kids stuff hamburgers elsewhere. But cramming three courses in 90 minutes is a recipe for indigestion. Breakfast is the short-crossing meal. Newhaven-Dieppe at two hours offers more digestion time, but lousy food. Take sandwiches. Le Havre, Caen or Cherbourg, or St Malo with P&amp;O Portsmouth or Brittany Ferries and five to 10 hours at sea are the dining crossings. </p> <p>If your journey is to the south of France, or Spain, then travelling through Calais adds at least two to three hours' driving. The toll road costs Ffr40 to reach Rouen. The upside is that it zooms through places straight from history for you to take coffee breaks in, from Crecy to the Somme. </p> <p>Boulogne only takes 20 miles off any drive but the Hovercraft sails almost into the main street and the town has fish restaurants worthy of France's biggest fishing port. It is a good place to idle before the slog to the Mediterranean. </p> <p>Dieppe, also picturesque, and 130 miles south, is the closest port to Paris. It has suffered from the cross- channel operators' wars. P&amp;O pulled out its four-hour ferries, preferring the mass market of Calais, and Hoverspeed, the Boulogne operator, now fills the slot with a limited fast-craft summer service. Portsmouth-Le Havre, with P&amp;O Portsmouth and Portsmouth-Caen, Cherbourg or St Malo with Brittany Ferries, which markets itself on sailing halfway down France, give real sea crossings, with cinemas and overnight cabinets and, once landed, easy access to places like Bayeux and the Normandy Landing beaches and Brittany's craggy beaches. </p> <p>Phoning operators direct or using the internet gives flexibility. Most carriers have early-booking schemes. Most charge about \u00a310 per ticket bought at the port. All have loyalty schemes - some involve a fee, some a minimum number of crossings. All are worth checking even for a once-a-year travellers. Check short-stay offers and the super-low fares that companies don't rush to promote. They exist to show how extensive a company's range is. Even if they are meant as window dressing, you can buy them. </p> <p>I cross most months, using different routes, and this month almost paid \u00a3147, with a loyalty discount, for a five-day ferry ticket when I was going for three days and a \u00a399 offer existed. I gave my loyalty number to the sales person - and the three-day price wasn't being quoted to loyalty travellers. Which company doesn't matter. All are the same. It is a jungle out there.

      "bodyText": "William the Conqueror, hell bent in 1066 on East Sussex, meant to set sail from Normandy, but bad weather drove him north. Huddled in the mouth of the Somme, the ambitious descendant of the Vikings regrouped to sail across La Manche. Crossings of the English Channel, as we prefer to call it, pepper our literature and history. Armies used it through the Hundred Years' War. Smugglers use it still. Dickens' heroine in A Tale of Two Cities has a nightmare crossing. Agatha Christie's characters drive long-nosed Thirties' tourers on to ferries. Hitler established a submarine fleet at Boulogne. My mother, as a schoolgirl, was one of the civilians evacuated in the 1939 phoney war, taken in a tiny fishing boat from St Malo. If the gods are against us, we may still experience the thrills of early travellers. A force nine gale can make a rough 90 minutes out of even the shortest route, Dover to Calais. A couple of times a summer, ferocious weather turns that into 17 or so hours, with the ferry unable to dock. For the most part, though, the Channel is more a challenge to the ticket-bargain instinct than to sea legs, with the Great British holidaymaker facing a minefield of deals. The last decade has been dominated by the end of duty-free sales. Price rises did not immediately follow rationalisation of Customs' duties since the operators pegged them to retain passengers. This year, the effect is showing, with rises of up to 27% across all companies. However, competition for travellers remains fierce so there are deals. The mechanics are worth a thought. Choice one is which drive you prefer in England. Dover or Folkestone is fine from London, but from Birmingham or Liverpool or Glasgow then Newhaven, Southampton and Portsmouth may be attractive. Choice two is the Chunnel or a ferry. If you get sea sick, choose the Chunnel. If you are claustrophobic, the ferry. For the rest, planning starts with deciding what best suits your party and your pocket, remembering that road miles stack up pounds in petrol plus nervous strain. If you want an overnight port-side stop, choose France. Hotels are cheaper. Personally, looking for a speedy arrival near or north of Calais, I go for the tunnel. I prefer 30 minutes' reading the paper in my car in a Chunnel train to 90 minutes on a ferry. The odd tenner is worth it to avoid the nag from the kids about on-board special offers. Said kids, however, like the ferry, games machines and all, especially if there is a McDonald's. For the disabled and those with young children, the tunnel comes with the benefit of no staircases, although ferries provide help and, if forewarned, load people needing access first. For pet owners, with quaran tine relaxation, the Chunnel is probably better than leaving Fido inside the car in the hold. Some ferries will take animals, some not, but hold travel is normal and can be hot, noisy and frightening.

The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, spoke to the Rwandan and Ugandan presidents by phone on Thursday and secured the promise of a ceasefire to take effect later in the day, but it failed within hours. The latest flare up in this sideline to Congo's own civil war, which also involves seven foreign armies, started last Sunday after two previous bouts of fighting between the former allies were defused by regional summit meetings. Uganda and Rwanda back three rival Congolese rebel groups in the north - none of them effective fighting forces. Control of Kisangani - the country's third city - is key to whatever political settlement eventually emerges for Congo. Its capital, Kinshasa, is now held by the weak government of President Laurent Kabila. This third round of fighting between Uganda and Rwanda followed a surprise meeting between President Kabila and the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. It was the first time these two central figures in this war had ever met. They recommitted themselves to the Lusaka peace agreement of last year which would remove the seven foreign armies from the country and disarm the thousands of men responsible for Rwanda's genocide now in Kabila's army. In Kisangani this week a detailed plan to demilitarise the city failed when Ugandan units, withdrawing simultaneously with Rwandan troops, first changed the agreed route and then fired on a withdrawing Rwandan unit. The fighting escalated from there. As small arms rattled through the city yesterday one UN observer, Lieutenant-Colonel Khan Khalid, said: \"They are trying to scare the population.

But in 1658, it was handed over to the Swedes along with a massive part of what is now southern Sweden. The old city around Stortorget is a mix of Gothic and Dutch Renaissance architecture, with delightful parks and waterways providing a relaxing counterpoint to the bustle. For shopping, head down S\u00f6dergatan where a collection of lively caf\u00e9s spread themselves over the pedestrianised street during the summer. Cutting through the \u00d8resund Park brings you to a stretch of decent beach called the Golden Coast. The city's busy nightlife is focused on Lilla Torg.

      "body": "<p>The first thing to know about going to the Caribbean is that everybody you tell - even those who quite like you - will hate you for it. You might as well announce you're planning to share a penthouse in Chelsea Harbour with Tamara Beckwith. Not that it matters: when you're drinking rum punch watching a mango-coloured sunset, it's difficult to recall that the rest of the world even exists, much less worry about what it might think. </p> <p>While much of the Caribbean has become more accessible and affordable in recent years, islands such as Anguilla and St Martin are still closer to life as it is in Bond films than to life as you or I might know it. This is a world of icing-sugar sand and champagne-laden speedboats; a world where chocolate-dipped strawberries appear as if by magic in your bedroom and everyone starts each holiday looking as tanned and sleek as if they've just returned from their last one. Hotels such as La Samanna on St Martin, or Malliouhana on Anguilla, would never be so gauche as to describe themselves as \"glamorous\" or \"exclusive\" - the preferred term is \"upscale\" - but to fit in, you do need to think rich. </p> <p>On arrival at La Samanna, we were shown to our beachfront villas, which included fully kitted-out kitchens. \"Oh, so you can do self-catering,\" said one of our group. Liliana, the impeccably courteous guest-relations person, could not disguise her horror at such a notion. \"The kitchens are for guests who prefer to have a chef come and cook for them in their suite.\" Of course, silly us. </p> <p>A few days later in Malliouhana, as meal arrangements were being explained to us, another enquired whether breakfast was served as a buffet. Jasmin, the inevitably glamorous guest-relations person, clapped her manicured hands in amusement at such an idea. \"A buffet! No... we don't do buffets at Malliouhana.\" </p> <p>Only 15 minutes apart by boat, St Martin and Anguilla are nonetheless entirely different. St Martin is a dressed-up, see-and-be-seen island, while Anguilla is altogether more laid back. Physically, too, they are in contrast: St Martin is mountainous, with bright blue sea and golden sand; Anguilla flat and sandy, with the palest turquoise sea and silver-white sand. </p> <p><strong> St Martin</strong></p> <p> Despite its diminutive size - just 37 square miles - St Martin hosts more than one million visitors a year. The island is divided into two distinct sides, one administered by the French and the other by the Dutch. This poses few practical problems for the visitor, however - there is no passport control between the two, and the dual currency issue can be sidestepped by bringing US dollars, which are accepted everywhere. The Dutch side is renowned for its casinos, the French side for its attention to fine dining. </p> <p>Driving from St Martin airport to La Samanna, at the far west point of the French area on Baie Longue, the impact of hurricanes on this region can be seen in the ongoing rebuilding programmes - after 35 years of calm, this area of the Eastern Caribbean has been ravaged in the last decade. St Martin had still not fully recovered from Hurricane Luis, which took direct aim at the island in 1995, when Hurricane Lenny struck last November. Travellers should note that hurricane season is September, but the otherwise year-round perfect weather can be affected by stray hurricanes and weather systems between August and November. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation</strong> </p> <p> La Samanna, made up of a main building with spectacular ocean views and villas which stretch along the bay, is pure white, with terracotta floors, bright Mexican tiles and gaudy exotic flowers - Mediterranean chic in paradise. The rooms are spacious, but not too grand - even though the bathroom was bigger than my entire flat. Stand-out features of a very chi-chi hotel are the swimming pool, which is large enough for decent lengths and has a poolside bar perfect for post-swim refreshments (I recommend the strawberry daiquiris) and the restaurant, where first-class French cuisine and wine are served on a terrace overlooking the ocean. </p> <p>Apparently it is not uncommon for guests, swept away by the romance of sunsets and suntans, to decide to get married while they are here. This is entirely feasible - frankly, anyone who takes you on holiday to a place like this has got to be worth marrying - and can be arranged, with officials roped in from the more lenient Dutch side of the island. </p> <p> <strong> Where to eat</strong> </p> <p> But if the Air of Romance for which the Caribbean is famed isn't enough to keep you occupied on St Martin, head down for lunch at Orient Beach, a long stretch of white sand dotted with relaxed, shady restaurants. Kontiki restaurant and beach bar (tel: 590 87 43 27, $30 a head) specialises in fish and seafood, and overlooks the nudist stretch of the beach, so there's no shortage of interesting views. </p> <p> <strong> What to do and see</strong> </p> <p> If you're still restless, there are watersports to be sampled - waterskiing, windsurfing, jetskiing are all easily arranged, while the less adventurous among us found the snorkelling more than enough. A trip on a boat is one of the best ways to pass the time (and to perfect that millionaire tan). We took The Great Escape, La Samanna's boat, captained by Vinny Agosta - who is an ex-NYPD detective inspector (homicide). An unwelcome intrusion of the nastier side of life into an island paradise, you might think, but when you see the size of the barracudas snaking through the snorkelling coves, Vinny is exactly the kind of guy you want watching your back. </p> <p>If you're on a boat, it's worth making a detour for at Karibuki, a tiny restaurant on the sandy island of Ilet Pinel offering plates of piquant conch and the freshest lobster in the shade of a palm tree. </p> <p><strong> Anguilla</strong><br> </p> <p> Fifteen minutes on a ferry, and we were in Anguilla. The island has an air of peacefulness that comes from having been - in the nicest possible way - something of a backwater. Until recently, after all, a perfect climate and 33 dazzling white sand beaches was of less interest to the rest of the world than the greener, richer surrounding islands. And tourism has still not reached a level to disturb the calm: fishing is still the island's primary industry. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation</strong> </p> <p> Meads Bay, on the north of the island, was recently voted the seventh best beach in the world, and is the setting for the phenomenally stylish Malliouhana Hotel. The staff are without exception charming, the food and wine out of this world, the rooms huge and each with terraces, the better to admire the stunning views. There are no TVs in the rooms (far too classy for that), although children are kept happy with cartoons and videos in the TV room. In fact, with three swimming pools and a supervised playground complete with giant waterslide, children seemed to be as content as us adults were, lounging on the private, sheltered Turtle Cove or in the cool shuttered bar (CD of choice: Macy Gray). </p> <p> <strong> What to see and do</strong> </p> <p> We visited the rum factory on Road Bay (264 497 5003), where you can take a tour, have a tasting and buy a bottle.

      "bodyText": "The first thing to know about going to the Caribbean is that everybody you tell - even those who quite like you - will hate you for it. You might as well announce you're planning to share a penthouse in Chelsea Harbour with Tamara Beckwith. Not that it matters: when you're drinking rum punch watching a mango-coloured sunset, it's difficult to recall that the rest of the world even exists, much less worry about what it might think. While much of the Caribbean has become more accessible and affordable in recent years, islands such as Anguilla and St Martin are still closer to life as it is in Bond films than to life as you or I might know it. This is a world of icing-sugar sand and champagne-laden speedboats; a world where chocolate-dipped strawberries appear as if by magic in your bedroom and everyone starts each holiday looking as tanned and sleek as if they've just returned from their last one. Hotels such as La Samanna on St Martin, or Malliouhana on Anguilla, would never be so gauche as to describe themselves as \"glamorous\" or \"exclusive\" - the preferred term is \"upscale\" - but to fit in, you do need to think rich. On arrival at La Samanna, we were shown to our beachfront villas, which included fully kitted-out kitchens. \"Oh, so you can do self-catering,\" said one of our group. Liliana, the impeccably courteous guest-relations person, could not disguise her horror at such a notion. \"The kitchens are for guests who prefer to have a chef come and cook for them in their suite.\" Of course, silly us. A few days later in Malliouhana, as meal arrangements were being explained to us, another enquired whether breakfast was served as a buffet. Jasmin, the inevitably glamorous guest-relations person, clapped her manicured hands in amusement at such an idea. \"A buffet! No... we don't do buffets at Malliouhana.\" Only 15 minutes apart by boat, St Martin and Anguilla are nonetheless entirely different. St Martin is a dressed-up, see-and-be-seen island, while Anguilla is altogether more laid back. Physically, too, they are in contrast: St Martin is mountainous, with bright blue sea and golden sand; Anguilla flat and sandy, with the palest turquoise sea and silver-white sand. St Martin Despite its diminutive size - just 37 square miles - St Martin hosts more than one million visitors a year. The island is divided into two distinct sides, one administered by the French and the other by the Dutch. This poses few practical problems for the visitor, however - there is no passport control between the two, and the dual currency issue can be sidestepped by bringing US dollars, which are accepted everywhere. The Dutch side is renowned for its casinos, the French side for its attention to fine dining. Driving from St Martin airport to La Samanna, at the far west point of the French area on Baie Longue, the impact of hurricanes on this region can be seen in the ongoing rebuilding programmes - after 35 years of calm, this area of the Eastern Caribbean has been ravaged in the last decade. St Martin had still not fully recovered from Hurricane Luis, which took direct aim at the island in 1995, when Hurricane Lenny struck last November. Travellers should note that hurricane season is September, but the otherwise year-round perfect weather can be affected by stray hurricanes and weather systems between August and November. Accommodation La Samanna, made up of a main building with spectacular ocean views and villas which stretch along the bay, is pure white, with terracotta floors, bright Mexican tiles and gaudy exotic flowers - Mediterranean chic in paradise. The rooms are spacious, but not too grand - even though the bathroom was bigger than my entire flat. Stand-out features of a very chi-chi hotel are the swimming pool, which is large enough for decent lengths and has a poolside bar perfect for post-swim refreshments (I recommend the strawberry daiquiris) and the restaurant, where first-class French cuisine and wine are served on a terrace overlooking the ocean. Apparently it is not uncommon for guests, swept away by the romance of sunsets and suntans, to decide to get married while they are here. This is entirely feasible - frankly, anyone who takes you on holiday to a place like this has got to be worth marrying - and can be arranged, with officials roped in from the more lenient Dutch side of the island. Where to eat But if the Air of Romance for which the Caribbean is famed isn't enough to keep you occupied on St Martin, head down for lunch at Orient Beach, a long stretch of white sand dotted with relaxed, shady restaurants. Kontiki restaurant and beach bar (tel: 590 87 43 27, $30 a head) specialises in fish and seafood, and overlooks the nudist stretch of the beach, so there's no shortage of interesting views. What to do and see If you're still restless, there are watersports to be sampled - waterskiing, windsurfing, jetskiing are all easily arranged, while the less adventurous among us found the snorkelling more than enough. A trip on a boat is one of the best ways to pass the time (and to perfect that millionaire tan). We took The Great Escape, La Samanna's boat, captained by Vinny Agosta - who is an ex-NYPD detective inspector (homicide). An unwelcome intrusion of the nastier side of life into an island paradise, you might think, but when you see the size of the barracudas snaking through the snorkelling coves, Vinny is exactly the kind of guy you want watching your back. If you're on a boat, it's worth making a detour for at Karibuki, a tiny restaurant on the sandy island of Ilet Pinel offering plates of piquant conch and the freshest lobster in the shade of a palm tree. Anguilla Fifteen minutes on a ferry, and we were in Anguilla. The island has an air of peacefulness that comes from having been - in the nicest possible way - something of a backwater. Until recently, after all, a perfect climate and 33 dazzling white sand beaches was of less interest to the rest of the world than the greener, richer surrounding islands. And tourism has still not reached a level to disturb the calm: fishing is still the island's primary industry. Accommodation Meads Bay, on the north of the island, was recently voted the seventh best beach in the world, and is the setting for the phenomenally stylish Malliouhana Hotel. The staff are without exception charming, the food and wine out of this world, the rooms huge and each with terraces, the better to admire the stunning views. There are no TVs in the rooms (far too classy for that), although children are kept happy with cartoons and videos in the TV room. In fact, with three swimming pools and a supervised playground complete with giant waterslide, children seemed to be as content as us adults were, lounging on the private, sheltered Turtle Cove or in the cool shuttered bar (CD of choice: Macy Gray). What to see and do We visited the rum factory on Road Bay (264 497 5003), where you can take a tour, have a tasting and buy a bottle. At a nearby gift shop, a self-help book entitled The Courage To Be Rich was a fair pointer toward the type of tourism this island attracts. The monthly guide for visitors, What We Do in Anguilla, was also available - this is worth looking out for, even if you plan to do very little, for its restaurant listings. Where to eat Although Malliouhana's 20,000-strong wine cellar and exquisite menu (tuna and shrimp skewered with island fruits and sauteed squash spaghetti) would take months to explore thoroughly, a little adventurousness is well rewarded (however, bargain dining is seldom on the menu - expect to pay at least $20 for a main course almost everywhere). Unmissable is the lunchtime island restaurant of Scilly Cay (264 497 5123), run by a man called Gorgeous and his beautiful wife. From Island Harbour, wave and they'll send the boat across to fetch you, and deposit you under a thatched hut or on the tiny beach where you can tuck into huge portions of crayfish and potent rum punch. Perfect for evenings is Mangoes Seaside Grill (264 497 6479), run by New Yorker David Schnittlich, with a beach-deck location, delicious sesame snapper and lobster cakes, and great desserts. The airy Cedar Grove Caf\u00e9 at the Rendezvous Bay Hotel (tel: 264 497 6549) is more West Indian than many other establishments, the shrimp curry utterly delicious, and we were enchanted by the oral history of Anguilla as related by the hotel's octagenarian owner, Lydia Gumbs. Sitting on the veranda under the soporific whirl of wooden fans, the world seemed to buzz away like an irritating mosquito, and that all-important, other-side-of-the-world, pure-relaxation feeling descended. This is a feeling I normally associate with rucksacks, beach huts, and bottles of beer; yet here I was, having my champagne glass attentively refilled, and feeling just as peaceful. A worrying thought: I could get used to this.

      "byline": "AC Grayling",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Crowds have travelled from all over the known world to swarm through the hot landscape, trampling the city into a campsite, driving up food and hotel prices. They're diverted and divested of their money between sporting events by pickpockets, beggars, jugglers, and other street artists, orators, prostitutes, vendors of greasy kebabs and cheap wine - and sellers of drugs and charms to deal with stomach upsets after thunderstorms flood overworked sanitary facilities. The athletes are pros on hormones, the winners will get sponsorship deals, there's an arts festival for added cultural appeal and the city will grow rich from the tourist trade. </p> <p>Sydney, 2000? Elis in ancient Greece, 776BC - home of Olympia, site of the chief shrine to Zeus, ruler of the gods; host to the original Olympic games?It could be either. </p> <p>Some of Sydney's residents are apprehensive about the prospect of a modern equivalent of Elis's tumult. Some have taken up figurative arms, forming a pressure group - People Ingeniously Subverting the Sydney Olympic Farce (Pissof, for short). They not only object to the forthcoming chaos but also to the at least 2bn Australian dollars spent on building stadiums and facilities while Sydney's housing and anti-social deprivation projects are underfunded. They object to the stringent policing planned to cope with visitors and the security scares that are now part of every Olympic experience. And they are opposed by those who anticipate making a fortune from the games; local business is the only participant in Olympics 2000 assured of a gold medal in advance. </p> <p>The similarities between ancient and modern Olympics are not just in crowds and congestion. As in antiquity, the athletes who compete at Sydney will be professionally trained to ultimate fitness and will almost certainly have used body-building and performance-enhancing drugs on their way to the games. At Olympia, athletes ate animal testicles for a testosterone boost, and they knew about muscle-building drugs, stimulant herbs and energy-giving diets. </p> <p>Sydney's athletes can expect rich rewards if they win; but then, Pindar, Greece's greatest lyric poet, who wrote victory odes for Olympian laureates, said that a win at the games was a meal-ticket for life, earning a four-horse chariot parade through the cheering streets of home, followed by free housing, a pension, and permanent front seats at the theatre, because the athlete had proved to his home city that the gods smiled upon it. Modern advertising deals and guaranteed jobs at the local sports centre do not seem so grand, but they count as much. </p> <p>One apparent difference between Olympics past and present is that whatever gods are now honoured in the games - national pride, profit, the breaking of records - in antiquity the games were meant as a religious festival, in honour of Zeus, whose immense ivory and gold statue, sculpted by Pheidias , stood in the temple at Olympia and was one of the seven wonders of the world. </p> <p>But although there were religious ceremonies and processions throughout the games, including an opening invocation to Zeus Apomyios (Zeus, averter of flies) to keep summer insects away, most visitors, who came from all over the Greek world, from Spain to the Indus, were not pilgrims but one of the three orders into which, according to Pythagoras, all mankind divides: those who come to participate, those who come to buy and sell, and those who come to watch. (Philosophers, said Pythagoras, come to watch.) The temple, though, accumulated not just prayers but thousands of rich offerings during the games, highly lucrative to the local economy. </p> <p>Greek tradition said that Hercules, the human hero who became an immortal, founded the games at Olympia. They had probably been in existence for at least 500 years before the first recorded event in 776 BC, a single contest , 200-metre sprint, won by a local man, Coroebus of Elis, a cook by trade. In ensuing games other contests were added; a 400 metre dash, a long-distance race, and equestrian events for which a hippodrome was built . By 708 BC, the pentathlon was a major feature, the five events being the military skills of javelin and discus throwing, wrestling, jumping and running. Boxing and chariot racing followed, and a vicious form of no-holds-barred fighting called pankration , in which only biting and eye-gouging were forbidden. </p> <p>For several centuries all the events took place on a single day, but in 472 BC they were spread for the first time over several days, with a grand ceremony at the end during which victors were given their prize, a wreath of olive leaves from the sacred grove of Zeus. </p> <p>The Olympics were not the only games in the ancient world. Almost all Greek cities had such contests, and some became important events, especially the Pythian games in honour of Apollo at Delphi, which included musical as well as athletic competitions; the Isthmian games in honour of Poseidon, god of the sea, held at his shrine on the wave-lapped Isthmus of Corinth; and the Nemean games, also dedicated to Zeus, at Nemea in Argolis. </p> <p>Poets wrote triumphal odes for victors at all these games, conferring immortality on them. </p> <p>Music at that time meant all that the Muses inspire, so there were competitions in drama and the writing and performing of philosophical dialogues.There is a theory that this was how Plato began his philosophical career, almost by accident, impelled by literary ambition to enter dialogue competitions at the games. Then he became interested in what he was writing about, and philosophy took him over. His early dialogues fit the theory; they are highly readable, open-ended, unresolved debates, about virtue and justice, beauty and love, between Socrates and visiting Sophists or beautiful boys exercising naked in the gymnasium. </p> <p>Nakedness ended the games of antiquity. Gymnast comes from gumnos in ancient Greek, which means naked, for that is how the boys and men, and in Sparta, the girls, exercised. (Coroebus of Elis was thus the original naked chef.) When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, public nudity became officially unacceptable, and in 393 AD the Emperor Theodosius banned the games. Athletics was an early victim of the humourless and prudish gloom of Christian moralism. </p> <p>The biggest difference between Olympics old and new lies in the values they supposedly promote. The modern games began in 1896 at the instigation of Pierre de Courbertin, who saw himself as reviving an Olympic spirit in the interests of world peace. Ever since 1829, when the Greeks freed themselves from Turkish rule, efforts had been made to restart the games as an expression of Greek national identity and solidarity, but the endeavour failed. When Courbertin took hold of the project he gave it an expressly international character, and claimed for it the values which admirers of classical civilisation fondly imagined were exemplified in those simpler and manlier times. </p> <p>But if he had truly followed the spirit of the original games, he would have admitted no women or foreigners, for in antiquity only Greek-speaking men could compete, and the only women allowed to watch were priestesses of Demeter. There was no place for the hundreds of thousands of slaves on whom Greek life depended, except in their usual roles of servitude. In its racial exclusivity and celebration of a master culture, the ancient games has its closest parallel in the 1936 Munich Olympics, run by the Nazis. Whereas the modern spirit extols the virtue of participation - sportsmanship is what counts; taking part is as important as winning, and losing can be done with grace and courage - in ancient times losers were mocked, reviled, jeered and disgraced, sometimes not daring to return home afterwards. There was room for only one winner; to come second was to be nowhere. </p> <p>So important were the Olympic games in the ancient world that the calendar was set by them. They took place every four years, between mid-August and mid-September, and the four-year gap between them was an Olympiad. Although Pindar wrote many kinds of poems, only his four books of epinicians survive, the triumphal odes dedicated to victors at the games. They were hugely popular and widely read.

      "bodyText": "Crowds have travelled from all over the known world to swarm through the hot landscape, trampling the city into a campsite, driving up food and hotel prices. They're diverted and divested of their money between sporting events by pickpockets, beggars, jugglers, and other street artists, orators, prostitutes, vendors of greasy kebabs and cheap wine - and sellers of drugs and charms to deal with stomach upsets after thunderstorms flood overworked sanitary facilities. The athletes are pros on hormones, the winners will get sponsorship deals, there's an arts festival for added cultural appeal and the city will grow rich from the tourist trade. Sydney, 2000? Elis in ancient Greece, 776BC - home of Olympia, site of the chief shrine to Zeus, ruler of the gods; host to the original Olympic games?It could be either. Some of Sydney's residents are apprehensive about the prospect of a modern equivalent of Elis's tumult. Some have taken up figurative arms, forming a pressure group - People Ingeniously Subverting the Sydney Olympic Farce (Pissof, for short). They not only object to the forthcoming chaos but also to the at least 2bn Australian dollars spent on building stadiums and facilities while Sydney's housing and anti-social deprivation projects are underfunded. They object to the stringent policing planned to cope with visitors and the security scares that are now part of every Olympic experience. And they are opposed by those who anticipate making a fortune from the games; local business is the only participant in Olympics 2000 assured of a gold medal in advance. The similarities between ancient and modern Olympics are not just in crowds and congestion. As in antiquity, the athletes who compete at Sydney will be professionally trained to ultimate fitness and will almost certainly have used body-building and performance-enhancing drugs on their way to the games. At Olympia, athletes ate animal testicles for a testosterone boost, and they knew about muscle-building drugs, stimulant herbs and energy-giving diets. Sydney's athletes can expect rich rewards if they win; but then, Pindar, Greece's greatest lyric poet, who wrote victory odes for Olympian laureates, said that a win at the games was a meal-ticket for life, earning a four-horse chariot parade through the cheering streets of home, followed by free housing, a pension, and permanent front seats at the theatre, because the athlete had proved to his home city that the gods smiled upon it. Modern advertising deals and guaranteed jobs at the local sports centre do not seem so grand, but they count as much. One apparent difference between Olympics past and present is that whatever gods are now honoured in the games - national pride, profit, the breaking of records - in antiquity the games were meant as a religious festival, in honour of Zeus, whose immense ivory and gold statue, sculpted by Pheidias , stood in the temple at Olympia and was one of the seven wonders of the world. But although there were religious ceremonies and processions throughout the games, including an opening invocation to Zeus Apomyios (Zeus, averter of flies) to keep summer insects away, most visitors, who came from all over the Greek world, from Spain to the Indus, were not pilgrims but one of the three orders into which, according to Pythagoras, all mankind divides: those who come to participate, those who come to buy and sell, and those who come to watch. (Philosophers, said Pythagoras, come to watch.) The temple, though, accumulated not just prayers but thousands of rich offerings during the games, highly lucrative to the local economy. Greek tradition said that Hercules, the human hero who became an immortal, founded the games at Olympia. They had probably been in existence for at least 500 years before the first recorded event in 776 BC, a single contest , 200-metre sprint, won by a local man, Coroebus of Elis, a cook by trade. In ensuing games other contests were added; a 400 metre dash, a long-distance race, and equestrian events for which a hippodrome was built . By 708 BC, the pentathlon was a major feature, the five events being the military skills of javelin and discus throwing, wrestling, jumping and running. Boxing and chariot racing followed, and a vicious form of no-holds-barred fighting called pankration , in which only biting and eye-gouging were forbidden. For several centuries all the events took place on a single day, but in 472 BC they were spread for the first time over several days, with a grand ceremony at the end during which victors were given their prize, a wreath of olive leaves from the sacred grove of Zeus. The Olympics were not the only games in the ancient world. Almost all Greek cities had such contests, and some became important events, especially the Pythian games in honour of Apollo at Delphi, which included musical as well as athletic competitions; the Isthmian games in honour of Poseidon, god of the sea, held at his shrine on the wave-lapped Isthmus of Corinth; and the Nemean games, also dedicated to Zeus, at Nemea in Argolis. Poets wrote triumphal odes for victors at all these games, conferring immortality on them. Music at that time meant all that the Muses inspire, so there were competitions in drama and the writing and performing of philosophical dialogues.There is a theory that this was how Plato began his philosophical career, almost by accident, impelled by literary ambition to enter dialogue competitions at the games. Then he became interested in what he was writing about, and philosophy took him over. His early dialogues fit the theory; they are highly readable, open-ended, unresolved debates, about virtue and justice, beauty and love, between Socrates and visiting Sophists or beautiful boys exercising naked in the gymnasium. Nakedness ended the games of antiquity. Gymnast comes from gumnos in ancient Greek, which means naked, for that is how the boys and men, and in Sparta, the girls, exercised. (Coroebus of Elis was thus the original naked chef.) When Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, public nudity became officially unacceptable, and in 393 AD the Emperor Theodosius banned the games. Athletics was an early victim of the humourless and prudish gloom of Christian moralism. The biggest difference between Olympics old and new lies in the values they supposedly promote. The modern games began in 1896 at the instigation of Pierre de Courbertin, who saw himself as reviving an Olympic spirit in the interests of world peace. Ever since 1829, when the Greeks freed themselves from Turkish rule, efforts had been made to restart the games as an expression of Greek national identity and solidarity, but the endeavour failed. When Courbertin took hold of the project he gave it an expressly international character, and claimed for it the values which admirers of classical civilisation fondly imagined were exemplified in those simpler and manlier times. But if he had truly followed the spirit of the original games, he would have admitted no women or foreigners, for in antiquity only Greek-speaking men could compete, and the only women allowed to watch were priestesses of Demeter. There was no place for the hundreds of thousands of slaves on whom Greek life depended, except in their usual roles of servitude. In its racial exclusivity and celebration of a master culture, the ancient games has its closest parallel in the 1936 Munich Olympics, run by the Nazis. Whereas the modern spirit extols the virtue of participation - sportsmanship is what counts; taking part is as important as winning, and losing can be done with grace and courage - in ancient times losers were mocked, reviled, jeered and disgraced, sometimes not daring to return home afterwards. There was room for only one winner; to come second was to be nowhere. So important were the Olympic games in the ancient world that the calendar was set by them. They took place every four years, between mid-August and mid-September, and the four-year gap between them was an Olympiad. Although Pindar wrote many kinds of poems, only his four books of epinicians survive, the triumphal odes dedicated to victors at the games. They were hugely popular and widely read. In a play by Aristophanes, set in the 420s BC, a man asks his son to read him a Pindaric ode, and the boy chooses one that celebrates a victory 40 years earlier. The games were like the World Cup, only much bigger, and its heroes, who filled the popular imagination for decades and even centuries, gave Pindar and fellow poets the opportunity to retell myths, and to proclaim high moral and aesthetic aspirations for their culture. \"Let us not admit any contest greater than Olympia,\" sang Pindar; \"where Zeus presides over the race, so that the glory of victors might shine in the city of their birth, founded by some marvel of the gods.\" We cannot know what the level of ancient athleticism was like.

I am a full-time carer and part-time novelist and dramatist (as yet unpublished and unperformed). My current work-in-progress is a stream-of-consciousness novel about a pig. I have set myself some problems - obviously, I am not a pig myself and I have no idea what pigs think about all day. May I come to see you? I remain, madam your most humble and obedient servant, Adrian Mole.",

      "body": "<p>For Love Of The Game is a movie fraught with bittersweet ironies, but that doesn't mean you should rush out to see it. The third and least successful instalment in the Kevin Costner Baseball Trilogy that began with the superb Bull Durham and the elegiac Field Of Dreams, For Love Of The Game is a movie about a once-dominant pitcher (the American equivalent of a cricket bowler) who is now far past his prime. That the role of Billy Chapel is played by a once-dominant actor (The Bodyguard, Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, The Untouchables, Dances With Wolves) who is now far past his prime is the most striking of the bittersweet ironies that permeate this movie. But like I said, that's not necessarily a good reason to run out and see it.</p> <p>One reason that For Love Of The Game is not nearly as successful as Field Of Dreams and Bull Durham is because of the role Costner inhabits. In Bull Durham, Costner played a minor-league catcher, a hard-working, likeable guy who simply did not have enough talent to play in the major leagues. In short, he was an Everyman. In Field Of Dreams, he played the archetypal middle-American male, imbued with a reverence for family, tradition and baseball. Again, he was Everyman. But in For Love Of The Game, he plays an ageing jock who is a bit of a lush and who must now learn the hard way that baseball isn't everything. He is rich, he is famous, he sports a championship ring and he has a girl in every port. In a word, he is Everydude. How the audience is supposed to identify or feel sorry for this guy is anybody's guess.</p> <p>The oddest thing about For Love Of The Game is that it is a sports movie that seems to have been made for people who don't know much about or even like sports. In my own oblique little way, I am trying to suggest that it is a sports movie made for women. Unlike Bull Durham and Field Of Dreams, which are basically movies about the American male's belief in the healing power of baseball - a belief I happen to share - For Love Of The Game is a movie about the healing power of Kristy Swanson. </p> <p>It is a movie in which an ageing athlete, having walked away from the game he loves after pitching one of the most magnificent games in the history of the sport, cries himself to sleep at night because his girlfriend is moving to London. This, I submit, would never happen in real life; she wouldn't move to London, and he wouldn't cry if she did. Not after pitching a perfect game, in which not a single batter managed to reach base against him. This is a movie that first entices the audience with the possibility that the hero is going to achieve the impossible dream, and then tells us that the dream, while impossible, wasn't all that important. For Love Of The Game? More like For Love Of The Dame.</p> <p>The unflattering parallels with Bull Durham and Field Of Dreams do not end here. Where the former had wit and style and clever plot twists, and the latter exuded a goofy innocence, For Love Of The Game is calculating and generic, with a screenplay drafted by a committee of script doctors. Of course Costner is going to meet his beautiful girlfriend when her car breaks down on the side of the road; when was the last time a homely woman's car broke down on the Interstate? Of course Swanson will be a writer for Elle who knows absolutely nothing about baseball. And of course she will wear schoolmarmish eyeglasses. How else would we know that she is intelligent?</p> <p>That's not all. It goes without saying that we will have the fish-out-of-water scene where Swanson comes to Yankee Stadium and feels like an idiot. Of course we will have the fish-out-of-water scene where Costner visits a trendy downtown art gallery and feels like an idiot. Of course she will be a single mother with a rebellious daughter who doesn't trust men. Of course they will learn to love him because he is warm, sensitive and has a fantastic ski lodge in Montana. Of course he will stick his hand inside an electric saw and nearly wreck his career until the love of a good woman pulls him through. Of course all the fans at Yankee Stadium will tawk like dis because New Yawkers in da movies always tawk like dis, even though most New Yawkers woin't actually born dere and tawk like normal people. And of course his best friend will be a spit-and-sawdust yokel with a heart as wide as the Caucasus and a brain the size of a peanut. In the end, this isn't a movie about love or friendship or self-recognition, and it certainly isn't a movie about baseball. It's a movie about every other Strong Silent Type meets Miss Smartypants movie you've ever seen: The Horse Whisperer Bangs The Drum Slowly.</p> <p>When Kevin Costner took Hollywood by storm in the late 80s, audiences were beguiled by his plodding sincerity, by a winning dumbness that had not been seen since the days of Gary Cooper. Back then, Costner's movies fell into two groups: those in which he merely seemed naive (No Way Out, Field Of Dreams, Bull Durham, Robin Hood) and those in which he seemed like an outright numskull (Dances With Wolves, The Bodyguard, The Untouchables.) But as time went on, this act got tired, and very expensive, and though Costner continued to make big oafish movies (Waterworld, Wyatt Earp, The Postman), the public was no longer interested in seeing them.</p> <p>For a brief moment (Tin Cup) a couple of years ago it seemed that Costner might be getting his career back on track, but then came the unfortunate Message In A Bottle and now the wan For Love Of The Game. Unlike Billy Chapel, whose career is clearly over at the end of this film, Kevin Costner does not seem to be a pathetic has-been a la Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. Far more gifted than those two lummoxes, he seems like the kind of actor who still has a few good things left in store for him if he can only find the right script.

      "body": "<p>Back in the 80s, Dennis Quaid was a hot young actor with a wild streak as big as his home state of Texas. But a happy marriage to superstar Meg Ryan and one of the more interesting journeyman careers in modern Hollywood appear to have led him to a state of confident contentment. Now in his mid-40s, he's making a solid career out of playing solid, middle-aged guys, recently in films such as Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday, Steven Soderbergh's new drug war epic Traffic, his own directing debut Everything That Rises, and sentimental sci-fi thriller Frequency, due for release this Friday. In the latter, Quaid is a New York fireman, killed in the line of duty in 1969, who comes into contact with his adult son from the year 1999 over a cosmically supercharged ham radio, and they work together across the decades to change their destinies. </p> <p><strong>Was talking to Jim Caviezel across 30 years, which basically must have been like you were acting alone with a box, a special challenge? </strong></p> <p>That's not what it was, really. [Director] Greg Hoblit was very ingenious. He built two sets on the same soundstage and we had two crews shooting simultaneously, so we did those scenes in real time. Jim was talking on his radio, I was talking on mine, but I could hear his real voice, so it was like doing a scene rather than being hooked up with some sort of earwig situation with some actor over in a soundproof booth. It was fantastic. </p> <p><strong>As well as time travel, the deal here is reconnecting with your dead father, the ultimate ace for a male weepy film. </strong></p> <p>Our dads get us emotional. It hits a nerve in all of us that we're working out, no matter whether you had a great relationship with him or a bad one. </p> <p><strong>Did making Frequency dredge up anything you felt about your father? </strong></p> <p>He passed away about 14 years ago. We had a great relationship, nothing was left unsaid, but this definitely brought a lot up. For years after he died, something would happen and I'd go, \"Hey, I'll call\u00c9 Oh, I can't call him, he's not here.\" And I still regret some things, like he's not around to see his grandson. That would've been really cool. </p> <p><strong>Let's look at it from the other side of that fence. What, if anything, did this movie make you feel as a father? </strong></p> <p>I was pretty invested in this. My son was six years old, the same age as my son in the movie when I die, while I was making this film. One thing, y'know, I have to take care of myself to be around for him. But it didn't take a movie for me to realise an important thing like that. </p> <p><strong>You do have a knack for hanging around. You work more regularly than most actors your age, and usually on good stuff. </strong></p> <p>I'm still here, man. In fact, I feel like I'm doing the best work of my career right now. So I feel, at this point, like I'm in a very good place. </p> <p><strong>That said, don't you and Meg try to get out of Hollywood whenever you can and hang out on your Montana ranch? </strong></p> <p>It's really essential. I grew up loving the country, and I just have to have it, I really need it. It goes way beyond even a refuge from public life. I need to be in the country; I just feel more comfortable there. </p> <p><strong>Is it a working ranch? </strong></p> <p>It's more like a getaway place, really. I'm not really one for having a lot of cowshit around. The working ranch thing - it sounds really romantic until you actually get out there and freeze your hands off over an ice-cold water pump. </p>",

Now in his mid-40s, he's making a solid career out of playing solid, middle-aged guys, recently in films such as Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday, Steven Soderbergh's new drug war epic Traffic, his own directing debut Everything That Rises, and sentimental sci-fi thriller Frequency, due for release this Friday. In the latter, Quaid is a New York fireman, killed in the line of duty in 1969, who comes into contact with his adult son from the year 1999 over a cosmically supercharged ham radio, and they work together across the decades to change their destinies. Was talking to Jim Caviezel across 30 years, which basically must have been like you were acting alone with a box, a special challenge? That's not what it was, really. [Director] Greg Hoblit was very ingenious. He built two sets on the same soundstage and we had two crews shooting simultaneously, so we did those scenes in real time. Jim was talking on his radio, I was talking on mine, but I could hear his real voice, so it was like doing a scene rather than being hooked up with some sort of earwig situation with some actor over in a soundproof booth. It was fantastic. As well as time travel, the deal here is reconnecting with your dead father, the ultimate ace for a male weepy film. Our dads get us emotional. It hits a nerve in all of us that we're working out, no matter whether you had a great relationship with him or a bad one. Did making Frequency dredge up anything you felt about your father? He passed away about 14 years ago. We had a great relationship, nothing was left unsaid, but this definitely brought a lot up. For years after he died, something would happen and I'd go, \"Hey, I'll call\u00c9 Oh, I can't call him, he's not here.\" And I still regret some things, like he's not around to see his grandson. That would've been really cool. Let's look at it from the other side of that fence. What, if anything, did this movie make you feel as a father? I was pretty invested in this. My son was six years old, the same age as my son in the movie when I die, while I was making this film. One thing, y'know, I have to take care of myself to be around for him. But it didn't take a movie for me to realise an important thing like that. You do have a knack for hanging around. You work more regularly than most actors your age, and usually on good stuff. I'm still here, man. In fact, I feel like I'm doing the best work of my career right now. So I feel, at this point, like I'm in a very good place. That said, don't you and Meg try to get out of Hollywood whenever you can and hang out on your Montana ranch? It's really essential. I grew up loving the country, and I just have to have it, I really need it. It goes way beyond even a refuge from public life. I need to be in the country; I just feel more comfortable there. Is it a working ranch? It's more like a getaway place, really. I'm not really one for having a lot of cowshit around. The working ranch thing - it sounds really romantic until you actually get out there and freeze your hands off over an ice-cold water pump.",

Instead of worshipping gods and fetishes we have genetics and the internet - but strip away all the fancy wrappings, and we're back to life and death and the unknown. </p> <p>Juliet Mitchell is a prolific writer, psychoanalyst and feminist whose new book sets out to \"reclaim\" hysteria, a subject she feels has been relegated to the 19th-century consulting room. Before Freud, hysteria went through various mutations. In 5th-century Athens it was named usterie and diagnosed as being due to a wandering womb, although both men and women were thought to be susceptible to it. Christianity turned it into the work of the devil and the Renaissance recognised it as a medical concept. But it was Freud, in analysing Dora, who finally rid hysteria of its mysticism and - Mitchell argues - feminised it. </p> <p>In the 20th century, psychiatrists have redefined hysteria in various ways. Histrionic personality disorder replaces hysteria as an entry in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual. </p> <p>Mitchell believes that Freud brought about the feminisation of hysteria to avoid his own unconscious conflicts about the death of his brother. One of the new concepts she introduces is that, contrary to traditional psychoanalytical theory, it is sibling rivalry as much as Oedipal conflict that underlies hysteria.</p> <p>Mitchell relates this to a concept called \"laterality\", meaning relationships not only with brothers and sisters, but with peers and partners - with anyone who might stand between ourselves and our mothers, rendering us helpless. She writes: \"It is this catastrophic awareness that one is not unique which triggers the onset of hysteria.\" Freud, she argues, was himself a hysteric, but unable to face it, hence his suggestion that hysteria was a female disorder. The idea has since been perpetuated by a largely male medical and psychiatric profession. </p> <p>Because we've done away with carnivals and symbolic rituals as a way of expressing our hysteria, we have had to find other means. In some cases, hysteria is turned in on the body; what was known as conversion hysteria in Freud's time - paralysed limbs and the like - has become psychosomatic illness. And because a major feature of hysteria is mimicry (the hysteric is even capable of imitating his or her own illness), it is very difficult to pin down. </p> <p>Mitchell quite convincingly argues that hysteria is closely linked with trauma, although it is hard to know which comes first: does trauma result in hysteria, or does hysteria lead, for instance, to the recalling of an incident, as in false memory syndrome? In either case, for a man, hysteria as a result of trauma will probably be called \"post-war neurosis\" or even schizophrenia, while for a woman the hysteric label remains, with an implication of play-acting, deliberate or otherwise. </p> <p>The fairly dense jargon in Mitchell's book - its repetition and wordiness - don't make it an easy read. Nevertheless, she has some interesting things to say about our hysterical culture and the fascinating strangeness of human behaviour. </p> <p>Less of a slog, but with just as many important things to say, is Daniel Pick's Svengali.

      "bodyText": "Mad Men and Medusas: Reclaiming Hysteria and the Effects of Sibling Relations on the Human Condition Juliet Mitchell Allen Lane, \u00a320, 380pp Buy it at BOL Svengali's Web: The Alien Encounter in Modern Culture Daniel Pick Yale, \u00a319.95, 284pp Buy it at BOL Here come two books to remind us that nothing much has changed in the old unconscious: we just call things by different names. Instead of worshipping gods and fetishes we have genetics and the internet - but strip away all the fancy wrappings, and we're back to life and death and the unknown. Juliet Mitchell is a prolific writer, psychoanalyst and feminist whose new book sets out to \"reclaim\" hysteria, a subject she feels has been relegated to the 19th-century consulting room. Before Freud, hysteria went through various mutations. In 5th-century Athens it was named usterie and diagnosed as being due to a wandering womb, although both men and women were thought to be susceptible to it. Christianity turned it into the work of the devil and the Renaissance recognised it as a medical concept. But it was Freud, in analysing Dora, who finally rid hysteria of its mysticism and - Mitchell argues - feminised it. In the 20th century, psychiatrists have redefined hysteria in various ways. Histrionic personality disorder replaces hysteria as an entry in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual. Mitchell believes that Freud brought about the feminisation of hysteria to avoid his own unconscious conflicts about the death of his brother. One of the new concepts she introduces is that, contrary to traditional psychoanalytical theory, it is sibling rivalry as much as Oedipal conflict that underlies hysteria. Mitchell relates this to a concept called \"laterality\", meaning relationships not only with brothers and sisters, but with peers and partners - with anyone who might stand between ourselves and our mothers, rendering us helpless. She writes: \"It is this catastrophic awareness that one is not unique which triggers the onset of hysteria.\" Freud, she argues, was himself a hysteric, but unable to face it, hence his suggestion that hysteria was a female disorder. The idea has since been perpetuated by a largely male medical and psychiatric profession. Because we've done away with carnivals and symbolic rituals as a way of expressing our hysteria, we have had to find other means. In some cases, hysteria is turned in on the body; what was known as conversion hysteria in Freud's time - paralysed limbs and the like - has become psychosomatic illness. And because a major feature of hysteria is mimicry (the hysteric is even capable of imitating his or her own illness), it is very difficult to pin down. Mitchell quite convincingly argues that hysteria is closely linked with trauma, although it is hard to know which comes first: does trauma result in hysteria, or does hysteria lead, for instance, to the recalling of an incident, as in false memory syndrome? In either case, for a man, hysteria as a result of trauma will probably be called \"post-war neurosis\" or even schizophrenia, while for a woman the hysteric label remains, with an implication of play-acting, deliberate or otherwise. The fairly dense jargon in Mitchell's book - its repetition and wordiness - don't make it an easy read. Nevertheless, she has some interesting things to say about our hysterical culture and the fascinating strangeness of human behaviour. Less of a slog, but with just as many important things to say, is Daniel Pick's Svengali. He uses George du Maurier's story Trilby as his springboard into an exploration of the Victorian psyche. Du Maurier's tale is a deceptively simple one: Svengali, an intinerant conductor of \"Jewish aspect, well featured but sinister\", hypnotises a young artist's model, Trilby, without her consent. She eventually marries him and becomes an international concert star, but sings only when under his spell. The book, published in 1894, gripped readers on both sides of the Atlantic.

The Other then possesses the power that we have handed over, and in turn becomes both fascinating and terrifying (Pick pays tribute to Melanie Klein for her conceptualisation of projective identification). The Victorian love of fluff and nonsense, of smoke and mirrors, covered myriad anxieties. There was an obsession with, and terror of, the unleashing of emotion, particularly sexual. The story of the innocent Trilby and her Svengali is rife with sexual implications that were picked up by an excited and anxious public. Du Maurier received letters demanding reassurance that the relationship was merely paternal. After all, \"If a prostitute could be made to renounce her trade through hypnotic interference, why might not a virtuous woman be perverted by the same method?\" The Victorians were full of contradictions: fascinated by science, they were equally drawn to mesmerism and the occult. And while hypnosis was being performed on stage as entertainment, it was also being used in the consulting room by Dr Freud - upon susceptible young women not unlike Trilby. The terror of being seen into, of being controlled, is as powerful today as it has ever been, so perhaps it is inevitable that psychoanalysis should be linked with the Svengali-like figure of the hypnotist, who can take control of the very soul.

He insisted he hadn't made a \"confession\", since he had nothing to confess. \"I have no sins on my conscience, I have nothing to be ashamed of,\" he said. He had only discussed his belief in total sexual freedom because a journalist had asked him about it. \"I am a southerner, a Mediterranean man,\" he said. \"I believe that life should be enjoyed as much as possible.\" He refuses to regard himself as gay, and showed no interest in this month's Gay Pride march in Rome.

Until he reached his late 20s, he had been \"a fairly rigid heterosexual\", he said. He had believed that even thinking about certain things was wrong.

But it ought also to be remembered as the week when the Paris-based OECD produced a glowing report on the state of the UK economy. Leaving aside some qualifications about health spending and other matters, the report was almost too glowing for Mr Blair's liking.

      "body": "<p>The morning of June 10 1967 was \"a time of great concern and utmost gravity\" in the White House Situation Room, according to Llewellyn Thompson, a former ambassador to the USSR turned presidential adviser. A message had just been received over the Moscow-Washington hotline threatening Soviet military action that would lead to a nuclear confrontation. New evidence now reveals what action the Soviets were preparing: a naval landing on Israel's shores to prevent its total victory in the Six Day War.</p> <p>The Soviet Union had played a central role in escalating tension in the Middle East and had falsely accused Israel of massing forces on the Syrian border. For the first time, Moscow sent much of its Black Sea fleet into the Mediterranean and backed up the Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, when he blocked Israeli shipping in the Red Sea and demanded the removal of the United Nations force from Sinai.</p> <p>In memoirs published recently, Nikita Khrushchev said the USSR's military command persuaded its political leadership to support these steps, knowing they were aimed at starting a war to destroy Israel.</p> <p>On June 5, after Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against its Arab neighbours, the Soviet prime minister, Alexei Kosygin, had activated the hotline to Washington for the first time since it was installed following the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.</p> <p>\"I went into my office every morning at seven o'clock,\" said the then secretary of defence, Robert S. McNamara. \"At 7.15 the telephone rang. 'Mr Secretary, this is General Smith in the War Room. Kosygin is on the hotline and wants to talk to [President Lyndon] Johnson...what should I tell him?' I said: 'Why the hell do you ask me?' He said: 'The hot line ends at the Pentagon.' It wasn't even a telephone line then but a teletype, and I didn't even know it ended there.\"</p> <p>Mr McNamara called the sergeant standing guard outside Lyndon Johnson's door and ordered him to wake the president. Within fifteen minutes they and the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, had begun what became a nearly continuous conference in the Situation Room.</p> <p>On June 10, according to Kosygin, Israeli forces were heading for the Syrian capital, Damascus. The US no longer had a manned embassy in Damascus and - incredibly - had no independent assessment of the Israeli offensive on the Golan Heights. The director of the CIA, Richard Helms, was called in, but the best he could do was to try and reach \"friendly powers\" which still had missions in Syria.</p> <p><b> 'A grave catastrophe'</b><br></p> <p>Kosygin's message went on: \"A very crucial moment has now arrived which forces us, if military actions are not stopped in the next few hours, to adopt an independent decision. We are ready to do this. However, these actions may bring us into a clash which will lead to a grave catastrophe ... we purpose [sic] that you demand from Israel that it unconditionally cease military action... we purpose to warn Israel that if this is not fulfilled, necessary actions will be taken, including military.\"</p> <p>Mr McNamara recalled: \"In effect it said: Mr President, if you want war, you'll get war.\"</p> <p>The presidential adviser McGeorge Bundy later remembered that there had been \"considerable discussion about what in fact the Soviets would be able to do to the Israelis if they did try to carry out their threat. The Russians' possibilities were really not that impressive.\"</p> <p>But now a first hand account from one of the Soviet officers involved reveals that the Soviets were nonetheless poised to invade Israel.</p> <p>In June 1967, Yuri Khripunkov was a young gunnery lieutenant on board a BPK (large anti-submarine ship) of the Soviet navy, part of a large reinforcement for the Mediterranean flotilla which had arrived from the Black Sea base of Sevastopol in early May.</p> <p>In an interview, Mr Khripunkov, now 59 and a respected writer and educator, said that when Arab-Israeli hostilities broke out, his captain ordered him to raise and command a 30-man detachment of \"volunteers\" for a landing on the Israeli coast.</p> <p>Similar parties were being assembled on all the 30-odd Soviet vessels in the Mediterranean: a total of some 1,000 men. \"There was also one BDK with about 40 tanks and maybe a battalion of infantry,\" Mr Khripunkov said. His platoon was ordered to penetrate Haifa - Israel's main commercial harbour and naval base.</p> <p>Only one of the ship's sailors refused to \"volunteer\". He was later transferred off the ship but not otherwise punished. Mr Khripunkov himself had no hesitations - \"I was young and foolish,\" he said - even though the seamen were neither trained nor equipped for a commando raid on land.</p> <p>\"What were we supposed to accomplish, with my pistol and the sailors' AK47s? 'Get in there and see,' they told us. 'Wipe out the enemy forces'.\"</p> <p>\"It was a different world then. I had a holy faith in it all - the red flag, my officer's oath. We were going on a sacred mission, the [Israeli] aggressors had assaulted these poor Arabs and we were going to let them have it. Today I'm wiser and I probably wouldn't do it.\"</p> <p>Mr Khripunkov's account confirms how near the Soviets came to implementation of a \"contingency plan\". An officer of the GRU (Soviet military intelligence) later told a senior American analyst that the defence minister, Andrei Grechko, and his team wanted to \"provide the progressive Arabs with a unique and historic achievement - the destruction of Israel\" for which \"they would remain eternally beholden to Moscow\". Though the Soviets were confident of the Arabs' capability to defeat Israel, the contingency plan was prepared.</p> <p>While the landing force would probably have been overcome by Israel, it might have caused substantial casualties - and might have halted the Israeli advance. But as Mr Khripunkov points out, the gamble was much larger: globalising the conflict.</p> <p>\"There would have been no Israel left if we had landed. I've studied 'special weapons', and even without a hydrogen bomb, 10-15 warheads would have been enough,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Khripunkov and his men were well aware they were little but pawns in a global power play. \"A thousand men was nothing for the USSR,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They started counting at 5m.

      "bodyText": "The morning of June 10 1967 was \"a time of great concern and utmost gravity\" in the White House Situation Room, according to Llewellyn Thompson, a former ambassador to the USSR turned presidential adviser. A message had just been received over the Moscow-Washington hotline threatening Soviet military action that would lead to a nuclear confrontation. New evidence now reveals what action the Soviets were preparing: a naval landing on Israel's shores to prevent its total victory in the Six Day War. The Soviet Union had played a central role in escalating tension in the Middle East and had falsely accused Israel of massing forces on the Syrian border. For the first time, Moscow sent much of its Black Sea fleet into the Mediterranean and backed up the Egyptian president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, when he blocked Israeli shipping in the Red Sea and demanded the removal of the United Nations force from Sinai. In memoirs published recently, Nikita Khrushchev said the USSR's military command persuaded its political leadership to support these steps, knowing they were aimed at starting a war to destroy Israel. On June 5, after Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against its Arab neighbours, the Soviet prime minister, Alexei Kosygin, had activated the hotline to Washington for the first time since it was installed following the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. \"I went into my office every morning at seven o'clock,\" said the then secretary of defence, Robert S. McNamara. \"At 7.15 the telephone rang. 'Mr Secretary, this is General Smith in the War Room. Kosygin is on the hotline and wants to talk to [President Lyndon] Johnson...what should I tell him?' I said: 'Why the hell do you ask me?' He said: 'The hot line ends at the Pentagon.' It wasn't even a telephone line then but a teletype, and I didn't even know it ended there.\" Mr McNamara called the sergeant standing guard outside Lyndon Johnson's door and ordered him to wake the president. Within fifteen minutes they and the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, had begun what became a nearly continuous conference in the Situation Room. On June 10, according to Kosygin, Israeli forces were heading for the Syrian capital, Damascus. The US no longer had a manned embassy in Damascus and - incredibly - had no independent assessment of the Israeli offensive on the Golan Heights. The director of the CIA, Richard Helms, was called in, but the best he could do was to try and reach \"friendly powers\" which still had missions in Syria. 'A grave catastrophe' Kosygin's message went on: \"A very crucial moment has now arrived which forces us, if military actions are not stopped in the next few hours, to adopt an independent decision. We are ready to do this. However, these actions may bring us into a clash which will lead to a grave catastrophe ... we purpose [sic] that you demand from Israel that it unconditionally cease military action... we purpose to warn Israel that if this is not fulfilled, necessary actions will be taken, including military.\" Mr McNamara recalled: \"In effect it said: Mr President, if you want war, you'll get war.\" The presidential adviser McGeorge Bundy later remembered that there had been \"considerable discussion about what in fact the Soviets would be able to do to the Israelis if they did try to carry out their threat. The Russians' possibilities were really not that impressive.\" But now a first hand account from one of the Soviet officers involved reveals that the Soviets were nonetheless poised to invade Israel. In June 1967, Yuri Khripunkov was a young gunnery lieutenant on board a BPK (large anti-submarine ship) of the Soviet navy, part of a large reinforcement for the Mediterranean flotilla which had arrived from the Black Sea base of Sevastopol in early May. In an interview, Mr Khripunkov, now 59 and a respected writer and educator, said that when Arab-Israeli hostilities broke out, his captain ordered him to raise and command a 30-man detachment of \"volunteers\" for a landing on the Israeli coast. Similar parties were being assembled on all the 30-odd Soviet vessels in the Mediterranean: a total of some 1,000 men. \"There was also one BDK with about 40 tanks and maybe a battalion of infantry,\" Mr Khripunkov said. His platoon was ordered to penetrate Haifa - Israel's main commercial harbour and naval base. Only one of the ship's sailors refused to \"volunteer\". He was later transferred off the ship but not otherwise punished. Mr Khripunkov himself had no hesitations - \"I was young and foolish,\" he said - even though the seamen were neither trained nor equipped for a commando raid on land. \"What were we supposed to accomplish, with my pistol and the sailors' AK47s? 'Get in there and see,' they told us. 'Wipe out the enemy forces'.\" \"It was a different world then. I had a holy faith in it all - the red flag, my officer's oath. We were going on a sacred mission, the [Israeli] aggressors had assaulted these poor Arabs and we were going to let them have it. Today I'm wiser and I probably wouldn't do it.\" Mr Khripunkov's account confirms how near the Soviets came to implementation of a \"contingency plan\". An officer of the GRU (Soviet military intelligence) later told a senior American analyst that the defence minister, Andrei Grechko, and his team wanted to \"provide the progressive Arabs with a unique and historic achievement - the destruction of Israel\" for which \"they would remain eternally beholden to Moscow\". Though the Soviets were confident of the Arabs' capability to defeat Israel, the contingency plan was prepared. While the landing force would probably have been overcome by Israel, it might have caused substantial casualties - and might have halted the Israeli advance. But as Mr Khripunkov points out, the gamble was much larger: globalising the conflict. \"There would have been no Israel left if we had landed. I've studied 'special weapons', and even without a hydrogen bomb, 10-15 warheads would have been enough,\" he said. Mr Khripunkov and his men were well aware they were little but pawns in a global power play. \"A thousand men was nothing for the USSR,\" he said. \"They started counting at 5m. Each side wanted to demonstrate its dominant role _ The US sends in the [Sixth] Fleet. We bring in our Black Sea squadron. They send in spy planes. We start preparing a landing in Israel. The Israeli tanks move through Sinai and are ready to skip over the Suez Canal. What then? We land our force and world war three begins? We knew it was going to happen, that the whole world would be destroyed.\" This was the \"grave catastrophe\" threatened by Kosygin. A member of the Israeli general staff at the time recalls hearing that a Soviet landing \"had been discussed as a theoretic possibility at cabinet sessions\", but there is no evidence that Israel or the US knew the particulars of the impending operation. Mr McNamara dismissed the suggestion that, ironically, Israel itself may have prevented an early warning of this threat when its warplanes attacked and disabled the American intelligence ship Liberty in the Mediterranean on June 8, thus probably crippling US capability to eavesdrop on Soviet ships in the region. But the ships never landed and Moscow's failure to intervene caused the Soviets considerable trouble with their other proteges, particularly Cuba. Immediately after the Six Day War, Kosygin hastened to Havana to placate Fidel Castro's anxieties and, according to the CIA cable, \"informed Castro that the USSR had been prepared to aid the UAR [United Arab Republic, Egypt's official name] in the struggle against Israel but Field Marshal Amir [Abdel-Hakim Amer], chief of the UAR armed forces, told the USSR that the UAR intended to stop fighting within several days.\" Fear of domination However, the CIA later reported that Amer and a powerful faction in the Cairo leadership had wanted to prevent total Soviet domination of Egypt. The Soviets made their threat over the hotline only when Syria too appeared to be on the verge of defeat. Thompson was \"impressed how much greater Soviet sensibility there was to the plight of the Syrians than to that of the Egyptians. At the time, the Syrians were the apple of the Russians' eye\". After Kosygin's menacing message was received, the US under-secretary of state, Nicholas Katzenbach, was dispatched from the Situation Room to \"call in the Israeli ambassador and put pressure on the Israelis to accept a ceasefire\".

The PR war between Charles and Diana was in full flow and as far as tabloid editors were concerned it was open season. That she survived so long, navigating a course through the storms of Camillagate, Diana's infamous Panorama interview, and her subsequent death which saw Charles's popularity plumb new depths, was testimony to what one former royal correspondent called \"her utter professionalism\". \"She was a very business like person, but she managed to remain approachable.\" A product of the government information service, Ms Henney spent some time at Downing Street in the Thatcher era gaining an insight into the workings of press and government.

The atmosphere of detente led to unfamiliar behaviour on both sides of the barricades. Tabloid editors sat on stories and photographs they would have rushed into print in the mid 1990s; likewise St James's Palace, through events carefully managed by Ms Henney, allowed access that would have been unimaginable prior to the demise of Diana. Prince Charles and his sons were pictured together during a Balmoral summer break and photographers snapped up images of Prince William taking his first turn behind the wheel shortly after turning 17. There was the odd skirmish. And there was unease as stories concerning cocaine use by those in royal circles appeared to taint William's image. These stories were with met a typical Henney flourish however when reports that Prince Charles had issued a stern warning to his son about the importance of selecting friends wisely found their way into Sunday newspapers. As recently as last weekend pressure from St James's Palace was reported to have persuaded the BBC to drop a planned programme unfavourably comparing the lot of an 18-year-old on Merseyside with that of the future king. Yet the same day as the BBC story appeared, a far more significant story appeared in the News of the World. The announcement that Prince Charles's mistress, Camilla Parker Bowles, had met the Queen for the first time did not appear by chance. It was un derstood to have been the result of the close relationship between the editor, Rebekah Wade, and Mark Bolland, Prince Charles's deputy private secretary. Mr Bolland is regarded as a more sophisticated operator than Ms Henney, a practitioner of spin rather than PR. That his hand was seen to be behind the thawing of relations between Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace would not have boded well for Ms Henney. Statement It is a matter of deep regret that confusion has arisen over the photographs commissioned to mark Prince William's 18th birthday. The copyright of these pictures should have been established at the time they were taken to ensure that St James's Palace owned the copyright and that any proceeds arising from the use of the photographs went to charity as has normally happened in the past. This issue was not resolved and copyright is now wrongly vested elsewhere. The Prince of Wales hopes that, in the light of the clear and consistent policy, no one should profit from pictures, either of Prince William or Prince Harry, and that those who do own the copyright will make clear that all proceeds will go to charity. To do otherwise would be to undermine the work the palace, the press and the Press Complaints Commission have all vested in the protection of Prince William and Prince Harry's privacy. We share our part of the blame, in that we should have taken action to ensure that copyright was vested with us. As a result of this, Sandy Henney, press secretary to the Prince of Wales, has this afternoon tendered her resignation from His Royal Highness's office. The Prince of Wales has with very deep regret accepted this. Miss Henney made clear to His Royal Highness that she did so both because of the mistakes made over the issue of the copyright and to ensure that the privacy of Prince William and Prince Harry was maintained in the future. That always has been and remains our first priority as it always has been that of Miss Henney. Miss Henney has been a loyal and invaluable member of staff who has given outstanding service over seven years. She has also been of immense service in putting together with the media the successful arrangements to safeguard the privacy of Prince William and Prince Harry. It is because she believes the recent dispute with one newspaper over copyright threatens those hugely important arrangements that she has resigned. We wish to underline our continuing policy reflecting the clear wish of the Prince of Wales to treat all newspapers and magazines, on matters relating to Prince William and Prince Harry, in an absolutely fair and equitable fashion. It is not acceptable to the Prince of Wales that anyone should profit unfairly from their images and we intend that nobody ever should. The burden of maintaining that policy rests in the short term with those who in this instance own the copyright of pictures taken to mark Prince William's birthday. We continue to hope they will act fairly and responsibly by assigning the proceeds of Prince William's pictures to charity.",

Britain's merchant marine may not be what it was, but last Sunday a colour squadron of shipping's finest assembled at Luton Airport for their EasyJet ride to the Med. They were, they were sure, in good hands, for EasyJet's founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou is himself the scion of a shipping family (papa loaned him five bars to get airborne in 1995). Alas, EasyJet's flight was delayed by 10 hours, leaving the mariners cooling their heels at Luton with \u00a35 bar vouchers while shipping big shots swanned around Piraeus carving up the world's sea trade. And you wondered why the red duster is seen so rarely nowadays. </p> <p>\u0095 Back home, and a spy has dug out an absolute gem from the bad old days of boom and bust, the October 1992 issue of Chequerboard, the Treasury's staff mag. Those with long memories may recall that the previous month had not been among the Treasury's finest, what with the total collapse of its economic policy following sterling's ejection from the ERM. So what was Chequerboard's lead story? \"Equal opportunities have been moved high up the management agenda\", complete with a cheery a pic of paymaster general Sir John Cope beaming next to \"Sue Broyd of personnel\". Golden Wednesday rates the briefest of mentions in a story headed: \"Troubled markets keep MG [the Treasury's monetary group] busy\". Page 6 promises a look \"behind the scenes\" at the European finance ministers' summit in Bath, but omits to mention what has since become public knowledge, that the assembled chancellors were at each other's throats. </p> <p>\u0095 Over in the French treasury, France's newish finance minister Laurent Fabius is pedalling furiously away from his previous incarnation as a Gallic Tony Blair. The French phrase meaning to toe the party line, which is utiliser la langue de bois (use the wooden tongue), and the former speaker of the national assembly was doing just that on Thursday. Asked by a journalist if he resembled the incumbent at Downing Street, Mr Fabius dead-batted this one, citing two big differences: Mr Blair was the more handsome and his own spouse was not about to emulate Cherie. Nary a word about the symbiotic relationship between the left and the market place. But in haughty, centralised Paris, the market still knows its place, as seen in the French government's rejection of an auction of third-generation mobile telephone franchises in favour of a behind-closed-doors franchise share-out masterminded by sound, sensible chaps such as, er, Mr Fabius. </p> <p>\u0095 And once again to Great George Street, where the top brass is boning up for Thursday's Mansion House speech. City worthies tried to meet Gordon Brown half way by dumbing down from white to black tie, but the Chancellor obdurately shows up in a lounge suit and his team - economic gurus Ed Balls and Gus O'Donnell and permanent secretary Sir Andrew Turnbull - feel obliged to do likewise, a cause of particular discomfort for the last-named. A mini-revolt fizzled out this year, we hear, when Mr Brown declared Sir Andrew ought to feel free to wear black tie should he wish. Not having reached the top by failing to spot a non-offer when he sees one, Sir Andrew declined and will be in civvies. </p> <p>\u0095 Meanwhile, America's compo culture has hit new peaks with a ruling from the Alaska supreme court. Pipeline worker Lawrence Allen fell ill in August 1997 having eaten pork chops, mashed potato and brussels sprouts. A hospital found his innards to contain two balls of undigested food, with the sprouts the most likely culprit.

      "bodyText": "Russia's President Vladimir Putin is to visit North Korea next month in a pioneering trip to open a new front in his campaign against controversial US missile defence plans and signal his determination to restore Russian clout and prestige abroad. Mr Putin, the first Russian leader to visit Pyongyang, will use the talks with Kim Jong-Il, the North Korean dictator, to try to undermine the US case for its planned missile shield by trying to coax the North Koreans into scaling down their ballistic missiles programme. The Kremlin confirmed yesterday that Mr Putin had ac cepted an invitation from Kim Jong-Il a day after the Russian and Chinese presidents spoke by phone about joint efforts to thwart the US national missile defence plan to intercept offensive ballistic missiles. Washington says the plan is aimed at North Korea and other \"rogue states\", while Russia and, particularly, China fear their strategic deterrents will be impaired if the plan becomes reality. North Korea yesterday denounced the US plans, accusing Washington of fabricating the rogue state bogeyman for its own military purposes. The diplomatic coup suggests that Mr Putin is bent on a double-pronged offensive against the \"son of Star Wars\" scheme which most big powers fear will undermine 30 years of strategic stability. He is to travel to Pyongyang - building on earlier efforts to ease North Korea out of self-imposed international isolation - from his first Beijing summit with China's President Jiang Zemin. In the Beijing and Pyongyang meetings, Mr Putin will discuss retaliation should the Americans go ahead with their missile shield. \"We have made clear what we will do\" if the US goes ahead, warned Sergei Ivanov, Mr Putin's national security adviser. \"This decision would kill Start I and Start II. The agreements on medium-range missiles would follow. There is no telling what China and other countries will do.\" Meanwhile, Mr Putin is to seek to exploit west European misgivings about the American plans at next week's Berlin summit with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. \"We propose talks with western Europe on these problems,\" the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said yesterday, calling for a \"pan-European early warning centre on missile launches and joint development of a pan-European system\" for missile defence. At his first meeting with Nato defence ministers since the Kosovo war disrupted relations, the Russian defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, outlined the Russian proposals to a sceptical reception in Brussels yesterday. No Russian leader has ever visited North Korea and relations between the communist bastion and Russia have soured since communism collapsed in the Soviet Union a decade ago. The thaw has been prepared by the Russian foreign minister, who went to North Korea in February, though the trip had to be repeatedly rescheduled, and Kim Yong Nam, number two to the North Korean ruler, visited Moscow in April. The Putin coup highlights what is emerging as a bout of dynamic diplomacy from the new Russian leadership. The North Korean talks will be sandwiched between a Russia-China summit in Beijing on July 18 and the G-8 summit of industrialised countries in Japan three days later. Kim Jong-Il broke with 17 years of staying at home last week by travelling to China ahead of next week's Korea summit and it is believed that the Russian and Chinese leaders discussed Korea on Thursday by phone.",

      "bodyText": "November 17, Europe's most elusive and effective terrorist gang, yesterday said that it had murdered Britain's top military diplomat in Athens because of his role in Nato's bombardment of Serbian targets last year. In a 13-page proclamation, outlining its motives for the killing, the group said Brigadier Stephen Saunders, aged 52, was a \"professional murderer\" who worked for a government that had committed \"Nazi-like crimes\". Brig Saunders, the first Briton to be attacked by the group, was assassinated because he had \"participated in the planning of the barbaric air strikes\" - an assertion that was immediately denied by the Ministry of Defence The MoD said that Brig Saunders had no role in the planning of the campaign and was based in Kuwait as part of the UN observers mission when the 78-day bombing campaign against targets in Kosovo and Serbia began in March last year. Likening the Nato offensive to the second world war annexation by Hitler of Czechoslavakia, the shadowy group said the Allies had deliberately killed \"thousands of unarmed civilians\". The statement, sent to a left ist Greek newspaper at dawn yesterday, also claimed responsibility for five other attacks, including last year's rocket raid on the German ambassador's residence. Analysts said the March date on the declaration suggested the murder, executed with extraordinary precision, had been planned several months in advance. Brigadier Saunders, who had been based in Athens for almost two years, was driving unescorted in an unarmoured car when two gunmen, riding a motorcycle, ambushed him. He managed to open the door of his white embassy Rover but four bullets lodged in his head, hands and chest were to bring about his death during surgery less than three hours later. Ballistic tests confirmed that the diplomat was killed by the .45 calibre pistol used in five of the revolutionary organisation's previous attacks. Brig Saunders was the group's 23rd victim since it emerged with the killing of the CIA's Athens station chief, Richard Welch, in 1975 shortly after the collapse of seven years of military dictatorship in Greece. The publication of the proclamation was soon followed by an appeal by the diplomat's widow. Heather Saunders implored Greeks to help find the \"wicked men\" who had killed her husband. Speaking outside the couple's Athenian villa in the presence of her two, distraught teenage daughters, she said: \"For the sake of the future of Greece, these people must be brought to jusitice.\" The Greek government said yesterday that it would step up the restructuring of its police force and make more intense efforts to end terrorist attacks. \"We must have results,\" a spokesman said. Three Scotland yard detectives arrived in Athens yesterday as security was tightened around British diplomats, not least Baroness Symons, the deputy defence minister who is in Greece on an official visit. But sources close to the Brit-ish-trained Greek counter-terrorism forces last night doubted the gang would ever be unearthed. \"CIA agents, who are specialised in the field, have been here for years and they've never got anywhere,\" said one local analyst. \"I think it's now a matter of luck if November 17 is ever caught.\"",

The harder he tries to sound ordinary, the dafter he sounds; somewhere between Joyce Carey in Brief Encounter and Dick van Dyke in Mary Poppins. Public schoolboys today tend not to make a virtue of their speech and manners. Had Blair begun: \"Good afternoon, Ladies. I am Anthony Blair, your prime minister,\" it would have had an old-school charm about it. But he is too far down the road of losing consonants and pitiably protesting that he is a tremendous fan of football and pop music. And, whereas the privately educated once entertained us with humorous skits and sub-Coward songs at the piano, they now do stand-up in an ersatz, blokey way. When they have to deal with heckling, they go all snooty, trying to say earthy things when it would sound much better if they said something like: \"Get the ruddy hell off my land\".</p> <p>I digress. My point is, Neil Kinnock has always had a beery, macho way with hecklers, but the style wouldn't work for Blair. Kinnock has dumped even more principles than Blair and has the viciousness of all those who have made that journey. There is a special kind of arrogance in people who wake up in the night screaming in guilt and shame. And yet Kinnock's bluff Welsh act still fools people, especially Labour party members, who are suckers for a regional accent.</p> <p>Put-downs would not work for Blair. Neither do his efforts to appear winning. He has exhausted that schtick. He has never understood that endlessly stating one's values is not convincing. One cannot get away with saying: \"I'm an honest kind of guy.\" The point is to say something that's true. And his attempts at vulnerability are irritating because they are so unsubtle as to be demonstrably vain. The Blair persona comes down to: \"Y'know, guys, I'm just like you, but in a kind of god-like way\".</p> <p>O ne thing that might have worked with an exclusively female audience would have been to work blue. Elderly ladies are filthy when not being supervised by menfolk who like filth but not in front of the ladies. But, again, I don't think Blair could have pulled it off (eh missus?) because he's too posh. Cheeky is apt to sound pervy in the wrong accent.</p> <p>Moreover, public figures being dirty or rude sound as though they are trying too hard. They usually only do it in private, which is especially annoying, because people who are foul-mouthed but able to control it cannot be trusted.</p> <p>Politicians, being untrustworthy, have not crossed that watershed between private and public. There was no chance that Blair would cause the punters to complain: \"I didn't mind the politics, but every other word was 'fuck'.\" In this instance, it appears that the politics was the problem, which is understandable. Tony Blair would be the obvious choice when trying to find a turn who is not too political. In fact, he can do 45 minutes without saying anything at all. He should seriously consider dropping the gags altogether and work up an act about a man trying to find his way out of a glass box. But he had to go and try political stuff on a WI audience before testing it in a smaller venue.</p> <p>None of this means that Blair is going to lose the next election. It is entirely possible but, to do it, he would have to lose it to someone. We keep hearing and reading that Hague is scoring points with his oddball routines, but it is New Labour's breath-taking ineptitude and passivity that makes Hague's comedy-Northern persona seem successful. He hasn't suddenly gained charisma, any more than Blair has lost it having once possessed it.</p> <p>Labour's problem is that it seldom tackles this kind of repulsive rubbish from the Tories. It has somehow allowed the heckler to become the main act. Given this situation, Labour should be shouting: \"Bollocks!\" at Hague's rightwing, racist material. Instead the government mutters: \"He's a bit over the top for my taste, but I like the one about asylum-seekers. I'll nick that.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

They usually only do it in private, which is especially annoying, because people who are foul-mouthed but able to control it cannot be trusted. Politicians, being untrustworthy, have not crossed that watershed between private and public. There was no chance that Blair would cause the punters to complain: \"I didn't mind the politics, but every other word was 'fuck'.\" In this instance, it appears that the politics was the problem, which is understandable. Tony Blair would be the obvious choice when trying to find a turn who is not too political. In fact, he can do 45 minutes without saying anything at all. He should seriously consider dropping the gags altogether and work up an act about a man trying to find his way out of a glass box. But he had to go and try political stuff on a WI audience before testing it in a smaller venue. None of this means that Blair is going to lose the next election. It is entirely possible but, to do it, he would have to lose it to someone. We keep hearing and reading that Hague is scoring points with his oddball routines, but it is New Labour's breath-taking ineptitude and passivity that makes Hague's comedy-Northern persona seem successful. He hasn't suddenly gained charisma, any more than Blair has lost it having once possessed it. Labour's problem is that it seldom tackles this kind of repulsive rubbish from the Tories. It has somehow allowed the heckler to become the main act. Given this situation, Labour should be shouting: \"Bollocks!\" at Hague's rightwing, racist material. Instead the government mutters: \"He's a bit over the top for my taste, but I like the one about asylum-seekers. I'll nick that.\" comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "He has been seen strolling through Bloomsbury, spotted dining at his favourite Chinese restaurant, glimpsed heading into a theatre, and - most tellingly of all - heard cracking a joke. Frank Dobson looks like a man who has had a great weight lifted from his shoulders since the end of the ordeal that was Labour's London mayoral campaign. It is more than five weeks since his crushing defeat in the London-wide election at the end of a campaign that was widely perceived to have been badly handled by the Labour party machine. Despite predictions that the former health secretary would be swiftly whisked back into government or the House of Lords, Mr Dobson's public profile has been non-existent since polling day. \"Frank's relieved that it's all over,\" said a friend in the trade union movement. \"He knew he had to keep going when it was a hopeless task but he couldn't wait for it to finish.\" He has lost \u00a350,000 a year and a chauffeur-driven ministerial car after going from a seat on the cabinet to Parliament's backbenches via a very public ordeal. The once loquacious Mr Dobson has not gone public and has declined requests for interviews, a clear indication of how bruised the former health secretary was by his treatment. Tony Blair knows the damage the Holborn and St Pancras MP could cause if he exposed Labour's rivalries and in-fighting, and is privately praising Mr Dobson's \"admirable\" loyalty to a party that showed him little of the same commodity. Downing Street has given no indication of what, if any, role is planned for Mr Dobson. Westminster colleagues would be surprised if he returned as a minister but fellow MPs do not want him to become the forgotten man of Labour politics. Clive Soley, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party, said yesterday: \"There is an enormous respect for Frank, not just for the battle he fought over the London mayor but for everything he achieved as secretary of state for health.\" He added: \"I don't doubt that Frank's talents and abilities will still find an outlet.\" Mr Dobson, 60, has spent a couple of weekends recuperating in Strawberry Cottage, the ex-railway worker's house which the railman's son owns as a bolthole near York. A political colleague said the West Ham fan is planning a trip to Holland, though he could not, or would not, say whether it was to watch Eng land in Euro 2000, take a romantic break with his wife Janet, or even to do both. Janet Dobson, an academic, feared the continual public spotlight that goes with being mayor and is believed to be relieved that it is all over. A prominent figure who worked closely with Mr Dobson in government speculated that he was more upset at no longer being health secretary than at not being elected mayor of London. \"He loved the NHS and they have taken his life away,\" complained the sympathetic minister. \"The party owes Frank.\" So what of the future for Mr Dobson? As a self-confessed Shakespeare \"nut\", he knows all about tragedy and betrayal in politics.",

      "bodyText": "The Jaguar has been traded in for a Bentley and within the next fortnight the Tory party will have a new election supremo to fight Labour in its urban heartlands. Steve Norris has been busy since he finished a very credible second in the mayoral campaign, producing one of the best Conservative results for years. Within days of the polls closing he had taken delivery of the Bentley, wisely deciding it would have been a mistake to do so during a campaign in which he promised to boost public transport. The former car dealer was out of luck when as he got out of his flashy new motor in Buckhurst Hill, Essex - a thief pounced to rip his \u00a39,000 Rolex from his wrist. However, a business trip took him to Russia, and he has resumed work as a director with bus, recruitment and engineering companies, as well as being a transport consultant. The ex-minister, once famous for his five mistresses, has also enjoyed a delayed honeymoon in Majorca with his wife Emma, 35, and their two-year-old son Harry. Yet it is the prospective new political role that has been the most interesting development. Mr Norris, 55, showed he could \"reach out\" to voters with his more caring Conservatism as he finished second to Mr Livingstone. Talks with William Hague, with whom he got on well during the campaign, are at an advanced stage. His title has yet to be decided but he will have a base at Tory central office in Smith Square, London, and will lead the charge in cities such as Birmingham and Bristol as well as in London. \"I am very keen to help William and the party in the run-up to the next election,\" said Mr Norris. \"We are talking about how I might be able to do just that.\"",

Mr Patten dealt with a proposal to give trade preferences to encourage recovery for the war torn Balkan region. Plans to ban sexual harassment were also discussed. By the evening, when he addressed a private dinner for the British Conservative Association of Belgium, he was feeling more relaxed. After speaking about his plans for reforming the EU's aid budget, he told the audience that his day had started badly but ended well in their company. \"It was a complete joke,\" one official said. \"It was 11.45 at night and he had just been given a vote of thanks for his speech when he said that at eight in the morning his day had begun with this very boring meeting.\" Reports about his remarks demonstrated the \"perils of having a sense of humour\" in public life, Mr Patten said. \"I am 56 now, I will be over 60 when this job is over and there will probably only be one British commissioner after the inter-governmental conference this year. It seems to me perfectly sensible to decide when you are over 60 there are other things to do in life,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Mr Patten has often said privately that Brussels is a grey and impenetrable place - a view shared by many officials who work there. Some Tories regard him as having gone native since taking up the job of Britain's second commissioner last autumn. He has spoken out publicly against William Hague's increasingly Eurosceptic line. But he has impressed people by his workmanlike approach to reforming the EU's aid programme and made waves last month with ambitious proposals to close the gap between rhetoric and reality. Mr Patten insisted his commission job was one of the most \"interesting\" he could do, but said he would serve only one term in office.",

John O'Farrell's important discussion of our attitudes to our own and other's identities (Heard the news? The war is over, June 7) points up the highly selective and often triumphalist images pushed out by the media.</p> <p>It is more important than ever that an appropriate history curriculum be pursued by all pupils till the age of 16 at least. Yet history has become increasingly marginalised. There is, too, a downside to the stress on \"relevance\" that has produced so much local history and narrowly conceived national history; little can then be done to sketch a broader picture, do justice to the achievements of others or our own failings. The government's pretence we are a young country has not helped the need to confront the reality of our past. <br><b>Sydney Wood</b><br> University of Dundee</p> <p>\u0095 Ending the commemoration of Dunkirk will not prevent football hooliganism. The real myth of the second world war lies in the films, books, comics, TV shows which have trivialised, sentimentalised and glorified war since. Heroic films of British victory are still shown regularly on TV. Hitler's tactics are among the reasons Dunkirk was not more of a disaster than it was, but the reality of the desperation of men machine-gunned on beaches and their rescue by those in small boats is no less real because of it. <br><b> Sandra Parker </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 Thank heaven for some sense. I feel lucky to be from Britain where I have enjoyed freedom from persecution and a good education. However, I can't help feeling ashamed of our country from time to time. We didn't win the war alone, just as the Americans didn't crack the Enigma code. We shouldn't forget Britain's history of invading and \"ruling\" other countries. The \"empire\" is nothing to be proud of, considering the mess we all too often left behind. <br><b> Sarah Comben</b><br> Bristol</p> <p>\u0095 For ex-servicemen, commemorating wartime events is not about pride or \"cherry-picking history\". It is about remembering comrades who were not so fortunate as yourself, who were laughing and drinking with you one day and gone the next. Presumably Mr O'Farrell hasn't gone through that experience. <br><b>Bob Charlesworth </b><br> Brough, N Humbs</p> <p>\u0095 The second world war is one of the few conflicts where British involvement was for the preservation of democracy and liberal values and not economic or territorial gain. The defining moment of French history is the revolution and the toppling of the ancien regime, in the US it is their revolutionary war and the Declaration of Independence. They are still, justly, celebrated. They demonstrate a part of a nation's character and sense of identity and there is no reason why the British people should not similarly regard the second world war. <br><b>Ben Scotting</b><br> Norwich</p> <p>\u0095 Something precious would be lost if the last of the wartime spirit (which led to the creation of the NHS) were allowed to go. It is because something like that is occurring that our politicians are going around like lost souls, seeking top-down, managerialist solutions for problems which are susceptible only to strategies based on a resurgence of trust and mutualism. <br><b>Drummond Hunter </b><br> Edinburgh</p> <p>\u0095 After the films Saving Private Ryan and U-571, can we expect one showing how the US conducted the brilliant rescue operation at Dunkirk? <br><b>Cherry Lavell </b><br>Cheltenham, Glos</p>",

It is more important than ever that an appropriate history curriculum be pursued by all pupils till the age of 16 at least. Yet history has become increasingly marginalised. There is, too, a downside to the stress on \"relevance\" that has produced so much local history and narrowly conceived national history; little can then be done to sketch a broader picture, do justice to the achievements of others or our own failings. The government's pretence we are a young country has not helped the need to confront the reality of our past. Sydney Wood University of Dundee \u0095 Ending the commemoration of Dunkirk will not prevent football hooliganism. The real myth of the second world war lies in the films, books, comics, TV shows which have trivialised, sentimentalised and glorified war since. Heroic films of British victory are still shown regularly on TV. Hitler's tactics are among the reasons Dunkirk was not more of a disaster than it was, but the reality of the desperation of men machine-gunned on beaches and their rescue by those in small boats is no less real because of it. Sandra Parker London \u0095 Thank heaven for some sense. I feel lucky to be from Britain where I have enjoyed freedom from persecution and a good education. However, I can't help feeling ashamed of our country from time to time. We didn't win the war alone, just as the Americans didn't crack the Enigma code. We shouldn't forget Britain's history of invading and \"ruling\" other countries. The \"empire\" is nothing to be proud of, considering the mess we all too often left behind. Sarah Comben Bristol \u0095 For ex-servicemen, commemorating wartime events is not about pride or \"cherry-picking history\". It is about remembering comrades who were not so fortunate as yourself, who were laughing and drinking with you one day and gone the next. Presumably Mr O'Farrell hasn't gone through that experience. Bob Charlesworth Brough, N Humbs \u0095 The second world war is one of the few conflicts where British involvement was for the preservation of democracy and liberal values and not economic or territorial gain. The defining moment of French history is the revolution and the toppling of the ancien regime, in the US it is their revolutionary war and the Declaration of Independence. They are still, justly, celebrated. They demonstrate a part of a nation's character and sense of identity and there is no reason why the British people should not similarly regard the second world war. Ben Scotting Norwich \u0095 Something precious would be lost if the last of the wartime spirit (which led to the creation of the NHS) were allowed to go. It is because something like that is occurring that our politicians are going around like lost souls, seeking top-down, managerialist solutions for problems which are susceptible only to strategies based on a resurgence of trust and mutualism. Drummond Hunter Edinburgh \u0095 After the films Saving Private Ryan and U-571, can we expect one showing how the US conducted the brilliant rescue operation at Dunkirk?

Their retraction, in the British Medical Journal, followed a threat of legal action by Scotia. The editor of the journal has also backed down, admitting: \"We did not do as well as we would have liked in publishing this point.\" The clarification of the doctors' findings yesterday sent Scotia's shares up 9p to 123.5p. It was a much needed boost to the company - analysts are concerned about a convertible bond issue which will require the repayment of \u00a350m debts unless the shares reach 340p by 2002. Scotia's chief executive, Robert Dow, said: \"The events have now been put into context and the authors have declared their conflicts of interest.\" Foscan is an innovative light-sensitive treatment, under which patients are injected with a medicine which becomes active when they sit under a certain wavelength of red light. The two doctors - John Clarke, a consultant at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, and Shehan Hettiaratchy, of West Midlands Regional Burns Unit - said they treated unusually bad burns on the arms of a group of South African backpackers, who had been paid to try Foscan in a clinical trial. Now, in a letter to the journal, they have conceded that these burns were likely to be due to poor administration of the product by doctors - some of the medicine may have leaked into the skin of patients' arms when injected, rather than going directly into the bloodstream. They also said that the usual rate of such a side effect was \"probably around 2%\", rather than the 43% found in the initial trial. Dr Dow still refused to rule out suing both the doctors and the journal: \"We reserve our legal position.\" He added: \"It is up to the editor of the British Medical Journal to take appropriate action to see that this doesn't happen again.\" Mr Clarke admitted that he had a \"competing interest\" because he provided a medical report supporting a claim for compensation by the South Africans against Scotia.

      "body": "<p>Last year the producer's club, Opec, finally showed that it had mastered the trick of marching the oil price all the way up from $10 to $30 a barrel. Now, however, it is having great difficulty in marching it back down again. </p> <p>That the oil price should be stubbornly stuck above Opec's preferred price range of $22 to $28 a barrel should be little surprise. Critics were quick to attack the Opec decision in March to ease productions curbs as insufficient. </p> <p>True enough, Opec did build in a mechanism to boost output if the initial increase proved insufficient, but when it should have been activated this week - adding another 500,000 barrels a day to the output - because the price had been above the reference rate for longer than the pre-set period, nothing happened. The producers simply sat on their hands and decided to defer a decision until later. </p> <p>So Opec is to blame again, then? Well, not entirely. The organisation itself is in a bind. On one hand it cannot be sure that its production levels are the only cause of the price stickiness. Another factor adding to the price pressure is an extremely tight market for gasoline products in the US - according to the International Energy Agency, which reports that pipeline problems and production snags at some refineries are having an important short-term bearing on the market. </p> <p>On the other hand, however, as the IEA noted yesterday, the persistence of high oil prices is forcing consumers to become more cost-conscious and to change their habits as a result. </p> <p>For the second consecutive month the agency has forecast a reduction in world oil demand this year - which is not necessarily what the oil producers want to hear. </p> <p>Last year they were able be boost the price because, unusually, they stuck to agreed production limits. Whether that discipline would hold in the face of a sustained drop in demand is another matter entirely. </p> <p>Attention is now turning to Opec's meeting later this month. Saudi Arabia is already reported to favour a 1m barrel a day boost in output. The other members should listen carefully. </p> <p>Turning the taps on now might produce a larger than expected price decline. Not doing so, however, risks putting the pressure on global growth. No prizes for guessing which outcome is easiest to reverse. Market volatility is one thing; slower growth quite another. </p> <p><strong> Deutsche angst </strong><br> </p> <p> Rolf Breuer, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, is a worried man. He is concerned that the bank - which has a market capitalisation of \u20ac53.5bn - is vulnerable to a takeover bid. </p> <p>Some of Mr Breuer's shareholders, too, are worried that the bank is already in the process of being taken over by the Anglo-Saxon investment bankers who work for it. </p> <p>The angst of both strands emerged at yesterday's annual meeting, which was never expected to be an easy ride for Mr Breuer in the wake of the collapse of the merger with Dresdner Bank. </p> <p>The deal fell through over the future of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson amid reports that some of Deutsche's top investment bankers were, shall we say, less than fully supportive. </p> <p>Little wonder, then, that one of Deutsche's shareholders asked whether the bank would be operated in future from Frankfurt or London, and questioned the extent to which the managers of the investment banking business, which earns just over half group profits, were pulling the strings. </p> <p>To Mr Breuer, such thoughts are \"total nonsense\" - although titling the bank's annual report Results 99 is hardly designed to soothe ruffled sensibilities. </p> <p>Outsiders might wonder what the linguistic fuss is about. Plenty of words cross the language barrier. The schadenfreude was almost tangible in parts of the banking community outside Germany when the Deutsche-Dresdner merger collapsed. </p> <p>But there is more to \"equity culture\" and \"shareholder value\" - to use two of Mr Breuer's favourite English phrases - than the language in which they are expressed. They reflect an underlying concept about who calls the corporate shots which is at variance with the traditional approach to the issue on the Rhine. </p> <p>Mr Breuer's own concerns - that the bank is vulnerable to a bid and that its capitalisation is short of what a buyer would get - suggest that he, too, should change some of his perceptions. </p> <p>Deutsche Bank is not worth what he thinks it is worth; it is worth what someone will pay for it, be they individuals or a predator on the prowl. That is the nature of the beast and Deutsche employs plenty of people who make the bank money from spotting exactly that kind of opportunity Mr Breuer reckons his own bank represents. </p> <p>If the Deutsche Bank chief has not got the message, perhaps the influence of the Anglo-Saxon investment bankers in the boardroom is being overstated.</p>",

On one hand it cannot be sure that its production levels are the only cause of the price stickiness. Another factor adding to the price pressure is an extremely tight market for gasoline products in the US - according to the International Energy Agency, which reports that pipeline problems and production snags at some refineries are having an important short-term bearing on the market. On the other hand, however, as the IEA noted yesterday, the persistence of high oil prices is forcing consumers to become more cost-conscious and to change their habits as a result. For the second consecutive month the agency has forecast a reduction in world oil demand this year - which is not necessarily what the oil producers want to hear. Last year they were able be boost the price because, unusually, they stuck to agreed production limits. Whether that discipline would hold in the face of a sustained drop in demand is another matter entirely. Attention is now turning to Opec's meeting later this month. Saudi Arabia is already reported to favour a 1m barrel a day boost in output. The other members should listen carefully. Turning the taps on now might produce a larger than expected price decline. Not doing so, however, risks putting the pressure on global growth. No prizes for guessing which outcome is easiest to reverse. Market volatility is one thing; slower growth quite another. Deutsche angst Rolf Breuer, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, is a worried man. He is concerned that the bank - which has a market capitalisation of \u20ac53.5bn - is vulnerable to a takeover bid. Some of Mr Breuer's shareholders, too, are worried that the bank is already in the process of being taken over by the Anglo-Saxon investment bankers who work for it. The angst of both strands emerged at yesterday's annual meeting, which was never expected to be an easy ride for Mr Breuer in the wake of the collapse of the merger with Dresdner Bank. The deal fell through over the future of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson amid reports that some of Deutsche's top investment bankers were, shall we say, less than fully supportive. Little wonder, then, that one of Deutsche's shareholders asked whether the bank would be operated in future from Frankfurt or London, and questioned the extent to which the managers of the investment banking business, which earns just over half group profits, were pulling the strings. To Mr Breuer, such thoughts are \"total nonsense\" - although titling the bank's annual report Results 99 is hardly designed to soothe ruffled sensibilities. Outsiders might wonder what the linguistic fuss is about. Plenty of words cross the language barrier. The schadenfreude was almost tangible in parts of the banking community outside Germany when the Deutsche-Dresdner merger collapsed. But there is more to \"equity culture\" and \"shareholder value\" - to use two of Mr Breuer's favourite English phrases - than the language in which they are expressed. They reflect an underlying concept about who calls the corporate shots which is at variance with the traditional approach to the issue on the Rhine. Mr Breuer's own concerns - that the bank is vulnerable to a bid and that its capitalisation is short of what a buyer would get - suggest that he, too, should change some of his perceptions. Deutsche Bank is not worth what he thinks it is worth; it is worth what someone will pay for it, be they individuals or a predator on the prowl. That is the nature of the beast and Deutsche employs plenty of people who make the bank money from spotting exactly that kind of opportunity Mr Breuer reckons his own bank represents. If the Deutsche Bank chief has not got the message, perhaps the influence of the Anglo-Saxon investment bankers in the boardroom is being overstated.",

Brilliantly lampooned by Tom Stoppard in his play, Arcadia, the Media Don would dress up a tendentious theory in hyperbolic language and then hawk it round newspapers, radio and TV in pursuit of fame and fortune. </p> <p>Robert Shiller is the perfect antidote to Stoppard's Bernard Valentine, who comes a cropper by cutting one corner too many with his theory about Lord Byron. The Cassandra of the US stock market is a throwback to the days when academics were slightly suspicious of publicity and were more concerned that their books were right than popular. </p> <p>That said, Shiller's meticulously researched new book - Irrational Exuberance - shows the sort of impeccable timing that would make a real Media Don go green with envy. </p> <p><strong> No swingeing attacks</strong><br> </p> <p> The book was published in the United States just 12 days after the hi-tech Nasdaq index peaked at over 5,000 points - and it has already sold more than 50,000 copies to those who believe that investors in America have taken leave of their senses. </p> <p>Sipping tea over a lunch of skate wing at one of London's discreet but quietly luxurious hotels, Shiller considers his words with care. He is in Britain to give a lecture at the London School of Economics and to publicise his book. </p> <p>But there are no swingeing attacks on those - the vast majority of US analysts - who confidently predict that the good times will go on for ever, and there are no attempts to encapsulate his 300-page book in a soundbite. Yet his thesis is clear - a market that is hugely overvalued by any historical yardstick is inherently precarious and risky. \"The most plausible scenario is that the stock market goes down a lot. 20 years from now the Dow [Jones Industrial Average] may be at 10,000, slightly below where it is today. That would be down in real terms assuming inflation at 2% a year.\" </p> <p>The book looks at the three peaks in the US stock market in the 20th century - 1901, 1929 and 1966. By 1920, share prices had lost two thirds of their real value in 1901, in the three years after 1929 they lost 80% of their value, and by 1974 they were 56% down on the levels of 1966. Yet judged by the ratio of share prices to corporate earnings, the stock market was even more overvalued at the start of this year than it was at the end of any of the other bull markets. </p> <p>Shiller is unimpressed by the claims that this time the internet means that everything is different. \"I'm impressed by the number of new eras we have had. We have had a lot of new developments in the past. Even if we are going through a new era, it doesn't necessarily bode well for corporate profits of existing companies.\" </p> <p>Like many of those who are sceptical of the new paradigm rhetoric, Shiller sees plenty of similarities with the 1920s. </p> <p>\"Like now, it was a period of conspicuous technological advance. The telephone was the 20s equivalent of the internet. Use was exploding in the 20s, but people were also getting their own cars and the radio was coming in. Communications and information technology went way up. You could hear the president on the radio, the talkies came in. It did create a sense of a new era. A typical family in the 20s saw a lot of changes between 1920 and 1929. They may not even have been wired for electricity by 1920, but by 1929 they had vacuum cleaners, cars, radios, telephones. It must have been spectacular.\" </p> <p>Until recently, this has been a message that few in the US have wanted to hear, However, the volatility of the markets coupled with aggressive action by the Federal Reserve to slow down the pace of economic growth has meant that there is now more of an appetite for those sounding a cautionary note. </p> <p>\"It's not as good a business to be a Cassandra,\" he says. \"Bureaus that organise speakers say that they can find talks for me but the prospects are not as good as they would be if I were bullish. Cassandras are less in demand at brokerage firms. </p> <p>\"The same goes for the non-stop business [television] channels that seem to prefer analysts who say the market is going up to those who suggest that it might be heading down. They bring on people audiences like and they tend to be salesmen for stocks. They try to be balanced but they feel nervous putting me on.\" </p> <p>An academic at Yale for the past 18 years, Shiller looks younger than his 54 years. He was brought up in Detroit, because both his grandfathers moved to Michigan in response to Henry Ford's decision to increase wages at his car plant to $5 a day - on the grounds that his workers needed to be able to afford the cars they were building. </p> <p> He was educated at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where all three of the academics who scrutinised his PhD were Nobel prize winners for economics, but came to the subject late. At school he taught himself Russian because of his love for Tolstoy and Dostoevsky - and briefly flirted with the idea of becoming a poet. \"I didn't always want to be an economist. I thought about being an astronomer, a medical doctor or a physicist,\" he says. </p> <p>Before arriving at Yale, in New Haven, he taught at Pennsylvania state university for five years and at Minnesota for four. \"People move around a lot these days, but I don't like to move too much.\" He says his wife, Virginia, who is a psychologist has had a considerable influence on his thinking about the way in which people behave. </p> <p><strong> 'Timing is important'</strong><br> </p> <p> The way people act both individually and collectively is one of the man themes of the book, which had a gestation period of 13 years. It was started back in 1987 but was put on the back burner after the stock market crash in October that year, before being revived in the summer of 1999. \"Timing is important\", Shiller notes drily. </p> <p>He testified before Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board in December 1996 that market levels were irrational. Two days later Greenspan made his now famous \"irrational exuberance\" speech from which Shiller's book takes its title. </p> <p>Since then, of course, share prices have soared in the US as the economy has enjoyed its longest-ever boom and the new technologies have proliferated. Some analysts now accuse Greenspan of allowing America to be gripped by asset-price mania, and that his failure to take action earlier has shortened the odds on a hard landing for the economy. </p> <p>Shiller believes that the \"gambling urge\" runs deep in Western societies. \"There is something about human nature. You need something to do every day. For some people it's the excitement of their lives. You need excitement.\" </p> <p>But he feels the idea that the markets are a one-way bet and that every fall in share prices should be seen as a heaven-sent buying opportunity is highly dangerous, even though it is now powerfully entrenched in the US. </p> <p>\"Consumer confidence is running at record levels and this is a very significant sign. I have been stressing the confidence side of the business cycle more than most. It could hold, but I could see it eroding and it could be quite a sharp downturn. A sharp recession is a real possibility.\" </p> <p>So is Greenspan to blame? \"It's hard to criticise him when there is low unemployment and low inflation at the same time. Greenspan is a very cautious man. So far his caution has worked all right.\" </p> <p>He is more critical of the thesis of a book suggesting that the Dow Jones will go on rising to 36,000 because investors have learned - and are still learning - that share prices are no longer risky. \"There is no research on that point. It's a get-rich-quick book\". </p> <p>Shiller believes that the confidence of investors is so ingrained that it will not be shaken overnight. He does not expect shares to fall in a straight line, but instead to follow the pattern of previous bear markets, where there was a prolonged period of decline. </p> <p>Between September 1929 and June 1932, he says, there were three days when prices rose for every four that they fell. \"There wasn't one day when it was all over.\" </p> <p>The book's conclusion is that periods of irrational behaviour are inevitable in free societies. Shiller believes that individuals should be protected against some of the risks involved in investment decisions, but rather than curbing speculation he favours expanding the number and variety of markets to spread risk. </p> <p><strong> Febrile atmosphere</strong><br> </p> <p> As an example, he says, people could buy property-linked securities that rose in value as the price of their homes fell. </p> <p>In the febrile atmosphere of the Manhattan real estate market, such securities might provide a vital insurance policy for those who would be caught in a double whammy should a collapse on Wall Street be accompanied by a property crash. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the author of Irrational Exuberance is taking his own advice. \"I have liquidated most of my stock market holdings, he says, adding that he has gone long of indexed bonds. In addition, and somewhat ironically, he is an entrepreneur in an internet-based company, Case Shiller Weiss. </p> <p>This provides an online service which can estimate for mortgage lenders the value of 70% of US properties within one minute. \"It's making a profit\", he says with some pride. </p> <p>Owners of companies similar to Case Shiller Weiss have made their owners fortunes in the last couple of years when they have been floated on the stock market - but CSW has yet to go down the same route. </p> <p>Nor - if Professor Shiller's darker predictions are right - is it likely to do so for some time.</p>",

Until the completion of the Millennium bridge, St Paul's Cathedral was affronted by the former Bankside Power Station directly opposite on the south bank of the Thames: a temple raised in praise of the state's God and the City of London's Mammon snubbed by a temple of industrial might and turbine-driven electric energy.

This is the longest horizontal or lateral suspension bridge yet built. So, it's a daring design, the forces acting within it and holding it together as powerfully stretched as a longbow at Agincourt. It looks so graceful, so natural and easy, and yet the competition winning design, by Lord Foster, Sir Anthony Caro and Chris Wise of the engineers Ove Arup and Partners, was subtly revised and mutated over many months as the challenge of building such a bridge emerged four years ago.</p> <p>Why difficult? Imagine a conventional suspension bridge: Humber, Severn, Forth road bridges. Their swaying carriageways are held up by steel rods hanging from the great suspension cables that loop between the vertiginously high gateway pylons that mark the entrances to the bridges and act as their anchors and foundations.

No one wanted the Millennium bridge to be marred by tall pylons that would have been controversial and probably unpopular.</p> <p>Now imagine pushing down the pylons at either end of the Severn bridge until they lie flat against Welsh and English soil. Imagine the astonishing forces that would now be transmitted through the suspension cables. Enough, you can't help feeling, to send M4 Mondeo man into orbit if they snapped.

Where the architect - Foster - has made such a difference is that he has resolved the engineering solution into the most elegant forms. What Foster has brought into the equation is the aesthetic joy in engineering felt by Brunel and Eiffel. Just look at the suspension cables that keep the bridge in tension. They are finished as smoothly as the bodywork of a Mercedes-Benz. So how was it all done? The sketch Foster made at the beginning of the project was based on a discussion with colleagues and clients - the Millennium Commission and sponsors the Financial Times - a slashing, confident stroke of the pencil. A very big pencil was needed to turn this stroke of inspiration into reality, yet many of the best designs of buildings, and to an extent engineering structures, have been made this way.</p> <p>The sketch was discussed with Chris Wise, the engineer who had realised Foster's communications tower in Barcelona a year or two before the Millennium bridge competition.</p> <p>If such a simple, single span bridge had been designed using, say, brick, stone or concrete, it would have had to be enormous, of immense mass, to be stable in the fast, tidal waters of the Thames. Without resorting to arches as with most conventional bridges, the only realistic way across was by a walkway supported by tension cables. And only by keeping these as low as possible could the low, clean profile as seen in Foster's sketch function.</p> <p>Caro worked mostly on the landing piers at either end of the bridge, but he also discussed the overall look of the bridge when complete. The construction of the bridge is, now that you can see it in its naked entirety, pretty much self-explanatory. The concrete piers with their Y-profiles are sunk deep into the riverbed.

      "bodyText": "Euro 2000, which kicks off today, involves some of football's highest paid stars. It is expected to draw a global television audience of 7 bn and generate millions of pounds in revenue. Away from the pitch, however, an equally crucial battle will be played out as the world's leading sports companies battle for supremacy and exposure in an attempt to assert their brands. And for one Euro 2000 visitor to the Netherlands this week, there lies behind the facade of the tournament a sorry tale of exploitation and oppression that is a world away from the glitzy promotion of some of the planet's best known logos. For the past few days, Suthasinee Kaewlekai has been touring the competition venues to highlight the conditions in many third world factories where, campaigners claim, leading sports companies are manufacturing their goods with little regard to how workers are treated or what they are paid. Ms Kaewlekai, 31, worked in a factory in Bangkok, producing goods for Adidas and Nike, two of the biggest sponsors of teams and players in Euro 2000. For less than \u00a31 per day she worked 12 hour shifts seven days a week, producing sportswear, shoes and replica kits for the two companies. She claimed conditions were poor in the Thai factory and the management was often brutal over meeting large orders within limited time, often denying workers statutory rights such as holidays and sick pay. Ms Kaewlekai said: \"It was not until I got to Europe that I realised how expensive the goods we produced are. I went into a shop and could not believe the cost of a sports shirt - it was almost the same as a month's wage for me. \"Our management did not want us to form unions and they persecuted workers who tried to organise themselves. We were forced to work overtime, often without pay, and were treated very badly.\" Ms Kaewlekai was eventually sacked in 1998 along with 23 others after they formed a union in an attempt to win more rights. The factory management claimed she was a disruptive influence. With around 1m fans expected to arrive in the Netherlands and Belgium for Euro 2000, Ms Kaewlekai was brought to Europe by the Clean Clothes Campaign, which was formed in 1990 and is attempting to raise awareness about the conditions in which leading brand clothes are manufactured. Esther de Haan, the campaign's co-ordinator, said: \"There's lots of money being poured into this tournament by sports companies, but people are working in slave conditions to ensure that these companies make a profit. We want football fans coming for Euro 2000 to be aware of this.\" The campaign is working closely with a Thai non-governmental organisation to help the workers form unions. Most Nike and Adidas goods are produced in third world countries, particularly in Asia, with orders being awarded to locally run factories. Many orders are further sub-contracted at local level, leading to claims that the companies have little idea of where and how their goods are produced. Adidas and Nike deny ignoring workers' rights for the sake of profit, claiming they have strict labour codes and are constantly monitoring wage levels and conditions to ensure a good working environment. Peter Csanadi, a spokesman for Adidas said: \"We have factories where the conditions are very good and we take this whole issue very seriously. We know that we have had problems, and we had to terminate some contracts because we saw that the management were not interested in good working conditions. \"We work closely with factory management and demand that they ensure good conditions for workers.

      "body": "<p>It seems a long time since the Japanese dominated the salerooms either as buyers or sellers. But recently they have been back in force, or at least their wares have.</p> <p>On May 18 in New York the revitalised Phillip's auction house held its first-ever sale of 20th century Japanese ceramics and design, with new record prices being set. And in London Christie's held an unprecedented series of sales of things Japanese. This Tuesday there was an Arts of the Samurai sale, with sets of complete armour as well as helmets, masks, swords, saddles and other equipment on offer.</p> <p>On Wednesday it held the sword fittings, netsuke, inro and pipecases from the Duncan Beresford-Jones Collection auction and a Japanese art and design auction, including ceramics. Again the sales went well with some record prices seen.</p> <p>A highlight of the New York auction was a monumental stoneware vase by Shoji Hamada. The vase, with its deep olive green glaze, commanded spirited bidding and ultimately sold for a world record price of $63,000, sailing over its pre-auction estimate of $14,000-18,000. Another highlight was an extremely rare early Bernard Leach slipware dish with a design of a leaping deer that commanded a price of $18,400, far exceeding its pre-sale estimate of $5,000-$7,000.</p> <p>Bernard Leach in a Japanese sale? Surely he is a famous English potter? The point here is that until now, Japanese ceramicists like Shoji Hamada and Kenichi Tomitomo, both of whom were declared \"living national treasures\" in Japan, were sold at auction in England as studio or craftsmen potters with one-off pieces as opposed to mass produced factory potters, along with other well known names from England and Europe like Michael Cardew, Lucie Rie and Hans Koper.</p> <p>Bernard Leach became an honorary Japanese because of his association with Japan, generally, and Shoji Hamada, in particular. In 1918, when Bernard Leach was in Japan, he met Hamada in Kyoto, where they worked together fusing what they believed to be the most important elements in eastern and western pottery. In 1920 Leach invited Hamada to England and they established the famous St Ives pottery where they built the first English 3-chamber kiln.</p> <p>The reason that Leach and Hamada are being marketed in New York is part of the game plan of Bernard Arnault, the French businessman who has bought Phillip's. He wants Phillip's to be up there with Christie's and Sotheby's, the two dominant auction houses which are almost 10 times bigger than Phillip's in terms of sales.This means getting into New York.</p> <p>The person who almost single-handedly brought the potter out of the studio and into the saleroom is Cyril Frankel, who knew both Lucie Rie and Bernard Leach. He used to work for Bonham's. But Phillip's has poached him and his associate Ben Williams. Having established the market in England, Frankel now seems to have broken through in New York.</p> <p>But whether you market these potters as Japanese, English or whatever, they have enjoyed a phenomenal rise in prices for their wares, as an auction dedicated to Lucie Rie and Hans Koper at Phillips in London on June 20 will undoubtedly show.</p> <p>Ten years ago these potters sold for hundreds of pounds. Now they fetch tens of thousands for the better pieces. You can still find a Hamada or Leach from \u00a31,000 but they are drying up.</p> <p>These modern Japanese potters are a different market to what we usually consider as traditional Japanese ceramics and are subject to some confusion over nomenclature. When American Commodore Perry steamed into Nagasaki in 1853 he re-opened trading links between Japan and the west. Japanese ceramics made for export quickly began to flood the markets of western Europe. They were named after the two ports through which they were shipped, Imari and Satsuma. Imari was often blue or white with mono-colour enamels or glazes, while Satsuma pieces were usually earthenware with a creamy glaze and ornate decoration. These are the pieces found in abundance in antique shops and markets.</p> <p>Ms Tsumugi Shoji at Barry Davies Oriental Antiques of London says: \"There are plenty of pieces dating from the 19th century onwards. They can cost just a few pounds. The market here has not moved at all really in recent years. But there are older pieces which are sought after and they are valuable.\" By this she means 17th century wares like Nabeshima and Kutani. These were both made for the domestic market. The really top of the range pieces were those made for export, like Arita and Kakiemon.</p> <p>Confusingly, Arita is an area close to Imari and these pieces are often called Imari. They are characterised, according to Mark Hinton at Christie's, by bold coloured enamelled overglazes on a blue background. Kakiemon, another generic name, also have these striking enamel overglazes. They became very popular in Europe in the 17th century as the Dutch East India Company and other traders shipped them from Japan. Large pieces were often imported to furnish William and Mary houses.</p> <p>A highly mannered model of an Indian elephant once sold for \u00a3749,000. At the Christie's sale on Wednesday a late 17th century puppy with decoration in blue black, yellow and green enamels was estimated at \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000. Mark Hinton says you can get a nice Kakiemon piece for around \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,000. But the market has begun to move in the past year as the Japanese economy has improved.</p> <p>\u0095 For further information: Christie's, 020-7389-2965, Phillip's, 020-7468-8229 or Barry Davies Oriental Antiques, 020-7408-0207.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I'd kill for Helene Weigel's crispy deep-fried chicken. But I could take or leave her vinaigrette and crouton salad. No. Bertolt Brecht's wife never cooked me lunch. Though, in a way, she did - and from beyond the grave. Looking for a place to eat, my assistant and I glimpsed some tables set out in a cobbled courtyard off Chausseestrasse, just to the east of the line of the old Berlin Wall. Leafing through the menu, it dawned on us that we had stumbled into Brecht's former residence and that the foundation running it was helping to balance the books by serving visitors his favourite dishes, prepared according to the letter of his wife's recipes. Brecht lived at 125 Chausseestrasse from 1953 until his death in 1956. Weigel stayed on until her death in 1971. They are buried together in the cemetery alongside the Dorotheenst\u00e4dtische Friedhof, which is the final home of a number of other luminaries including Hegel. It turns out that the playwright and his actress-manager wife are physically closer in death than they were in life. The guided tour of their house reveals that they occupied separate quarters on different floors. It is not the only revelation. You learn from the carefully preserved book shelves that Brecht and Weigel brought back from their American exile a passion for cheap thrillers. And you see that even the most avant-garde of people cannot help but be prisoners of the aesthetic and social conventions of their times. By today's standards, the Brechts had a very traditional marriage - a point which seems to have caught the attention of the artist Marc Chagall. He did a little sketch, which Brecht hung at the foot of his bed, showing the playwright stretched full length on the ground while Weigel hurries from an oven with what looks like a plate of cakes. It was she who saw to the decoration and furnishing of the house and while much of it is in exquisite taste, the conservatory hosts a collection of pewter plates and jugs and a green glass fishing float of the sort you once saw in cheap Italian restaurants. It is pure 1950s middle-brow. Brecht, as you might expect, enjoyed a privileged status in the defunct German Democratic Republic (GDR). Chausseestrasse 125 was given to him so that he would be near the Berliner Ensemble, which is about a quarter of an hour's walk away. Yet he never walked, always preferring to drive. What passed for the good life in the former GDR was nevertheless a long way short of the comfort and convenience enjoyed by many lesser artists in the west. With its framed photograph of Lenin, its distinctly austere decoration and its glorious, pre-Sputnik era television set, the home which Brecht and Weigel shared is also a monument to an entire culture whose foundations collapsed in the space of a few months. Not that the culture itself disappeared. Visitors to Berlin are struck by how difficult it is to see where the Wall once ran. For those of us who live here what is equally striking is how different the two halves of the city remain outside a relatively small area in the centre. I know someone who says he can tell the men apart by their shoes. I would not go so far as that, but I reckon I can tell the women apart by their make-up. With their simpler yet warier air, all but the the youngest easterners still give an impression of being semi-detached members of the capitalist world into which they tumbled 10 years ago.

Cassidy Uluru, the youngest of three brothers named after the rock and who was involved in the lighting of the torch on Thursday, said the debate about whether to climb was a matter of manners. \"If I go to another man's land, I would ask that man how I should act on his land,\" he said through an interpreter. \"If I go to Melbourne or Sydney, I would ask someone who lives there what is right to do.\" The Anangu are also lobbying for the colonial name, Ayers Rock, given by early explorers to commemorate a long-forgotten state governor, to be dropped in favour of its ancient title, Uluru. It is estimated that fewer than half of the 400,000 people who venture deep into the red centre of this continent each year try to climb the rock, but to many white Australians it is almost a rite of passage. The traditional owners of the surrounding world heritage site, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, which is jointly managed with the federal government, have not banned the rock's ascent but discourage it for spiritual and safety reasons. The ascent is closed when winds are high or temperatures exceed 36C (97F) but some locals are concerned that closing the climb altogether will damage business. One tour operator said the debate was driven by politics as much as beliefs. \"There are two things people come for and that's to climb the rock and see the Aborigines,\" he said. \"They won't take the climb away as they'd lose too much money.\"",

      "bodyText": "Police have been called in to investigate a consultant anaesthetist after a four-month-old baby died during a routine operation at a children's hospital. Mark Baxandall, a paediatric specialist, was suspended from Booth Hall children's hospital in Manchester last November following the death of Ijaz Ahmed, during a routine operation to correct a cleft lip and palate. Dr Baxandall was sent home by the hospital trust and suspended from his job following the baby's death. The boy's family returned to their home in Pakistan after their son died, but they have now returned to this country and have been contacted by the hospital trust about the investigation. The request to carry out a criminal investigation has been made seven months after the baby's death by the Manchester coroner, Leonard Gorodkin, who has passed on a file to detectives. It is not clear whether an inquest will take place until the criminal investigation has been completed. Police officers have visited the hospital in north Manchester this week as part of inquiries into Dr Baxandall. Hospital officials are also investigating another incident involving Dr Baxandall last year. Another child almost died during surgery at Booth Hall hospital in March last year in an operation where Dr Baxandall was the anaesthetist. The child has not been named. A retired consultant anaesthetist from Glasgow has already been appointed by the trust to investigate both cases involving Dr Baxandall. The hospital's inquiry has been put on hold while the criminal investigation takes place. Greater Manchester police confirmed yesterday that they are concentrating their inquiries on the death of Ijaz Ahmed. The General Medical Council has also told the hospital it intends to investigate under its conduct and performance procedures. The criminal investigation comes as NHS consultants are under increasing pressure to be accountable following the case of the gynaecologist Rodney Ledward, who botched operations during 16 years at a hospital in Kent. Dr Baxandall has worked at Booth Hall hospital for three years. He has been qualified as an anaesthetist for 17 years. A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said: \"We can confirm that police officers are looking into the circumstances surrounding the death of a child at Booth Hall last year.\" A spokesman for the Manchester Children's Hospitals NHS trust said: \"We are aware of the Greater Manchester police involvement and we will co-operate fully with any investigation.\" Dr Baxendall is a member of the Medical Defence Union, which assists medical professionals who are accused of misconduct or charged with criminal offences. A spokeswoman for the MDU said: \"Dr Baxendall is a member and we will be assisting him.\"",

      "bodyText": "A computer failure at London's air traffic control headquarters left thousands of travellers stranded yesterday, with flights delayed and cancelled across Europe. One of the key systems at the West Drayton control centre went down at peak time during the morning, forcing staff to fill in forms manually. The failure coincided with thunderstorms which caused a further backlog, leading to what one airline source described as chaos at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. The problem came at a bad time for the national air traffic control service, which is being groomed by the government for privatisation. Any apparent weakness in the service's operations could affect its value - the government believes it is worth more than \u00a3500m. A spokesman for the air traffic control service said: \"A system failure, together with severe thunderstorms over the North Sea, the UK, France and Germany has led to serious disruption.\" He added: \"There were no safety implications because contact between air traffic control and aircraft was not affected.\" Hundreds of short-haul flights were affected by delays, typically lasting between an hour and two hours. British Airways was forced to cancel 12 flights and a source within the airline described the situation as appalling. \"It will take us two days to get things straight in Europe - the crews and the planes are all in the wrong places.\" Although the system was only out of action for about 20 minutes, the knock-on effect was enormous. Industry sources said that in some cases, fully loaded planes were forced to wait on the tarmac for two hours before taking off. For a period during the morning, Heathrow ran out of gates and incoming planes faced long hold-ups in allowing passengers to disembark. Airlines are likely to have suffered considerable financial losses as a result of yesterday's disarray. BA declined to comment on whether it might seek compensation from the air traffic control service. BA added that passengers should expect further \"slight delays\" today.",

As the barracking and slow handclapping grew louder at the WI on Wednesday, his face forced itself into the famous rictus grin, only wider and more terrible than ever before. He looked like the Riddler when he realises Batman has finally got him cornered. Later he described the event as \"a debate\" and, in the Commons, \"an interesting exchange\". No it wasn't, it was a slow handclap. A debate is when people exchange ideasand beliefs. This was simply abuse. You might as well describe a fight in a pub car park as \"a lively discussion of the issues\". </p> <p>\u0095 One of the many reasons people can't stand Esther Rantzen is that insufferable smugness. Years ago I was on a breakfast show with her and made some mild remark about the royal family. She paused, turned to the camera, and flashed the teeth in a pitying sort of way. \"I always think it's so unfair to say things like that. You see, the royal family can't answer back.\" Can't answer back? Not only do they answer back, but they get their retaliation in first nowadays. What with spin doctors, speeches, off-the-record briefings and signed articles, they're as mute and retiring as Jonathan Ross at an awards dinner. Now they're squabbling in public with each other about GM foods. It all fits in with my theory that the royals are about to give up. They've finally decided that enough is enough, we're not grateful, and they're fed up with being constantly abused by the media. We know from Lord Goodman's confidante that Charles is, at best, ambivalent about being king, and would rather lead a quiet (though incredibly luxurious) life with Camilla. Now the family has decided to give us all a piece of their minds. It's rather like a couple leading for an acrimonious divorce: \"and another thing I always meant to tell you, your feet smell horrible in bed.\" </p> <p>\u0095Dorset place-names: I had no idea how many people had already strolled down this particular lane. Hilary Forrest of Manchester sent in a Lewis Carroll parody called Cattistocky, written by her late father SJ Forrest and based entirely on Dorset villages: \"Twas Swanage and the Durdle Door / Did Swyre and Chettle in the Cerne, / More Crichel was The Gallows Gore / And the Kimmeridge Pimperne.\"Beware the Cattistock, my son! / The jaws that bite, the paws that grub! / Beware the Lydlinch bird and shun / The Batcombe Melbury Bubb! . . .\" Ann Hummel describes the Somerset Critics' Circle, to be found a little west down the A303, including \"the stately doyen of dance writers, Compton Psuncefoot, enlivened by the trio of rural music aficionados, Corton Denham, Charlton Horethorne and Chilton Cantelo . . . keeping himself very much to himself, though, is Farmers' Weekly fashion correspondent, Mudford Sock.\" \u0095 While in Dorset I had a dreadful epiphany. I've noticed how, increasingly, people go to gorgeous places such as Lulworth Cove and then get on their mobile phones. It seems a little odd, especially since the conversations seem to be (I am an expert eavesdropper) of the \"and then I'm like, and you are not going to believe this\" variety. If they were offering a \"talking beauty spots for the blind\" service (\"and to my left, the spray from the waves is illuminated by glorious orange sunshine as it dashes against the rocks\") I could understand it. Still, as I stood under the cliffs near Bridport on a glorious sunny, wind-freshened day, my mobile phone rang, and I actually heard myself saying: \"Yeah, I'm on the beach. Now, I'm going to need those numbers by 4 o'clock tomorrow . . .\" Suddenly, as the Irish say, I caught myself on, and was tempted to play ducks and drakes with the wretched thing. Instead, I shame-facedly switched it off and kept it off till I got home. </p> <p>\u0095A friend reports a new and worrying trend: schools sending out incredibly long questionnaires to the parents of children who are about to start their primary education. Most seem to consist of almost unanswerable questions, possibly designed to elicit more information about the family than about the children themselves. \"I helped a neighbour fill hers in,\" she reports. \"It had questions on such as 'how do you indicate to your child that you are upset with him/her?' and 'how do you indicate that you are pleased?' \"The correct answers are, of course, 'I hit him' for the first, and 'I stop hitting him' for the second. But naturally we wrote: 'I admonish him gently but firmly.' It doesn't seem much use. They don't ask anywhere if he can read or write, or any skills he might have, or anything much about him really.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Thanks for your letters about Radio 1 disc-jockeys. There's a lot of anger out there, but I suspect that people who complain about wank jokes on air at the time children are arriving home from school are afraid to complain for fear of being thought Daily Mail readers. I gather Chris Moyles spent much of Monday afternoon being rude about me because of what I wrote about him. It's an excellent deal. I get the prestige of being accused of drivelling by a Radio One DJ (\"like being called ugly by a frog,\" to quote Jimmy Carter) and they have a real topic to bang on about. They remind me of the inhabitants of an old folks' home, bored to tears with their lives, having nothing to say to each other. My article must have been the equivalent of a new bloke coming to change the roller towels - it kept them going for ages. I was scanning through a few stations recently, and heard the familiar voice of Simon Bates. It seemed to be a BBC station - no ads - though I couldn't work out where it was coming from, until he read out a police message about a slow load moving down the road to \"Chi\". \"What on earth is 'Chi'?,\" he demanded. It turned out to mean Chichester. The poor bloke had a weekly show on the local radio station which covers Chichester and he didn't even know its police code. Oh well, apart from the Kenny Everetts and the John Peels, that's the fate that awaits many Radio 1 disc jockeys. Sacked by a new, ambitious controller, reduced to reading local traffic reports, followed by opening a new branch of B&amp;Q for \u00a3250, cash if you don't mind. </p> <p>\u0095To the Creative Freedom awards, held in aid of the Centrepoint charity for young people at risk. For the third time I (or The News Quiz), had been nominated for an award, and for the third time I lost - in this case to the richly-deserving Andy Marr, the new BBC political editor. My nomination said\" \"He brings reality to a world that is trying to avoid it,\" which is a shame, since I see that as the precise opposite of my job. By now I have practised my overjoyed Oscar-style smile at hearing the news of defeat, and was looking forward to doing it again. It's dazzling, almost like Tony Blair's rictus. But the audience was in darkness, and no one could see.</p>",

No it wasn't, it was a slow handclap. A debate is when people exchange ideasand beliefs. This was simply abuse. You might as well describe a fight in a pub car park as \"a lively discussion of the issues\". \u0095 One of the many reasons people can't stand Esther Rantzen is that insufferable smugness. Years ago I was on a breakfast show with her and made some mild remark about the royal family. She paused, turned to the camera, and flashed the teeth in a pitying sort of way. \"I always think it's so unfair to say things like that. You see, the royal family can't answer back.\" Can't answer back? Not only do they answer back, but they get their retaliation in first nowadays. What with spin doctors, speeches, off-the-record briefings and signed articles, they're as mute and retiring as Jonathan Ross at an awards dinner. Now they're squabbling in public with each other about GM foods. It all fits in with my theory that the royals are about to give up. They've finally decided that enough is enough, we're not grateful, and they're fed up with being constantly abused by the media. We know from Lord Goodman's confidante that Charles is, at best, ambivalent about being king, and would rather lead a quiet (though incredibly luxurious) life with Camilla. Now the family has decided to give us all a piece of their minds. It's rather like a couple leading for an acrimonious divorce: \"and another thing I always meant to tell you, your feet smell horrible in bed.\" \u0095Dorset place-names: I had no idea how many people had already strolled down this particular lane. Hilary Forrest of Manchester sent in a Lewis Carroll parody called Cattistocky, written by her late father SJ Forrest and based entirely on Dorset villages: \"Twas Swanage and the Durdle Door / Did Swyre and Chettle in the Cerne, / More Crichel was The Gallows Gore / And the Kimmeridge Pimperne.\"Beware the Cattistock, my son! / The jaws that bite, the paws that grub! / Beware the Lydlinch bird and shun / The Batcombe Melbury Bubb! . . .\" Ann Hummel describes the Somerset Critics' Circle, to be found a little west down the A303, including \"the stately doyen of dance writers, Compton Psuncefoot, enlivened by the trio of rural music aficionados, Corton Denham, Charlton Horethorne and Chilton Cantelo . . . keeping himself very much to himself, though, is Farmers' Weekly fashion correspondent, Mudford Sock.\" \u0095 While in Dorset I had a dreadful epiphany. I've noticed how, increasingly, people go to gorgeous places such as Lulworth Cove and then get on their mobile phones. It seems a little odd, especially since the conversations seem to be (I am an expert eavesdropper) of the \"and then I'm like, and you are not going to believe this\" variety. If they were offering a \"talking beauty spots for the blind\" service (\"and to my left, the spray from the waves is illuminated by glorious orange sunshine as it dashes against the rocks\") I could understand it. Still, as I stood under the cliffs near Bridport on a glorious sunny, wind-freshened day, my mobile phone rang, and I actually heard myself saying: \"Yeah, I'm on the beach. Now, I'm going to need those numbers by 4 o'clock tomorrow . . .\" Suddenly, as the Irish say, I caught myself on, and was tempted to play ducks and drakes with the wretched thing. Instead, I shame-facedly switched it off and kept it off till I got home. \u0095A friend reports a new and worrying trend: schools sending out incredibly long questionnaires to the parents of children who are about to start their primary education. Most seem to consist of almost unanswerable questions, possibly designed to elicit more information about the family than about the children themselves. \"I helped a neighbour fill hers in,\" she reports. \"It had questions on such as 'how do you indicate to your child that you are upset with him/her?' and 'how do you indicate that you are pleased?' \"The correct answers are, of course, 'I hit him' for the first, and 'I stop hitting him' for the second. But naturally we wrote: 'I admonish him gently but firmly.' It doesn't seem much use. They don't ask anywhere if he can read or write, or any skills he might have, or anything much about him really.\" \u0095 Thanks for your letters about Radio 1 disc-jockeys. There's a lot of anger out there, but I suspect that people who complain about wank jokes on air at the time children are arriving home from school are afraid to complain for fear of being thought Daily Mail readers. I gather Chris Moyles spent much of Monday afternoon being rude about me because of what I wrote about him. It's an excellent deal. I get the prestige of being accused of drivelling by a Radio One DJ (\"like being called ugly by a frog,\" to quote Jimmy Carter) and they have a real topic to bang on about. They remind me of the inhabitants of an old folks' home, bored to tears with their lives, having nothing to say to each other. My article must have been the equivalent of a new bloke coming to change the roller towels - it kept them going for ages. I was scanning through a few stations recently, and heard the familiar voice of Simon Bates. It seemed to be a BBC station - no ads - though I couldn't work out where it was coming from, until he read out a police message about a slow load moving down the road to \"Chi\". \"What on earth is 'Chi'?,\" he demanded. It turned out to mean Chichester. The poor bloke had a weekly show on the local radio station which covers Chichester and he didn't even know its police code. Oh well, apart from the Kenny Everetts and the John Peels, that's the fate that awaits many Radio 1 disc jockeys. Sacked by a new, ambitious controller, reduced to reading local traffic reports, followed by opening a new branch of B&amp;Q for \u00a3250, cash if you don't mind. \u0095To the Creative Freedom awards, held in aid of the Centrepoint charity for young people at risk. For the third time I (or The News Quiz), had been nominated for an award, and for the third time I lost - in this case to the richly-deserving Andy Marr, the new BBC political editor. My nomination said\" \"He brings reality to a world that is trying to avoid it,\" which is a shame, since I see that as the precise opposite of my job. By now I have practised my overjoyed Oscar-style smile at hearing the news of defeat, and was looking forward to doing it again. It's dazzling, almost like Tony Blair's rictus. But the audience was in darkness, and no one could see.",

      "body": "<p>We hear her long before we see her. A distant cacophony of rage and grief from a woman for whom love has turned rancid. Something wild. So when she appears, it is a bit of a surprise. </p> <p>She is dressed in a little black number with a cardie. She laughs nervously. Cracks jokes. Rubs one foot against the other, for all the world like a suburban matron cracking up. </p> <p>Director Deborah Warner and actress Fiona Shaw have done something extraordinary at the Abbey in Dublin: given us the first comic Medea. Shaw's Medea is more Winnie the Witch than evil sorceress. More sad than bad, infected with the bitter humour of the terminally despairing. </p> <p>In other circumstances this sly, witty and fascinating Medea would grace any dinner party. She chats to the women of Corinth, outlining her plans for revenge, like a mother holding court at an NCT meeting. And those little boys... there is no doubt how much she loves them, hugging them until it hurts. </p> <p>There are disturbing signs, though. The way she burns the children's teddy. The fact that the young nanny has thought fit to hide the kitchen knives. The way that, as her plans unfold, her sense of purpose becomes more defined. For the final slaughter she changes into the plastic uniform of the butcher in the abattoir. Still she falters. It takes three attempts before she can kill her sons, obliterate the future and all hope of happiness. </p> <p>This Medea is about the failure of romantic love, the breaking of promises and the canker at the heart of male/female relationships: what men want and what women need. In the perspex palace where country and western plays continuously in the background, Patrick O'Kane's muscle-bound Jason makes Houdini-like efforts to explain himself to Medea. To have his cake and eat it. It is no-go because Medea bought the whole romantic myth, she believed the promises and the songs. Her madness is that, despite everything, she would still have him back. The approach makes the play smaller, but also bigger. It is no longer a tornado of terror and pity, but an appalling domestic tragedy. This is the first Medea I've ever seen that I've wanted to cradle in my arms. </p> <p>At the end, Medea stands behind the despairing Jason, flicking water at him, trying to get his attention. The dead children's sailing boats still bob upon the water. After everything, the hunger of Medea's want for Jason is frightening, like a child's. That is real madness. And real horror. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Abbey, Dublin (00 3531 878 7222), till July 1.</p>",

      "bodyText": "We hear her long before we see her. A distant cacophony of rage and grief from a woman for whom love has turned rancid. Something wild. So when she appears, it is a bit of a surprise. She is dressed in a little black number with a cardie. She laughs nervously. Cracks jokes. Rubs one foot against the other, for all the world like a suburban matron cracking up. Director Deborah Warner and actress Fiona Shaw have done something extraordinary at the Abbey in Dublin: given us the first comic Medea. Shaw's Medea is more Winnie the Witch than evil sorceress. More sad than bad, infected with the bitter humour of the terminally despairing. In other circumstances this sly, witty and fascinating Medea would grace any dinner party. She chats to the women of Corinth, outlining her plans for revenge, like a mother holding court at an NCT meeting. And those little boys... there is no doubt how much she loves them, hugging them until it hurts. There are disturbing signs, though. The way she burns the children's teddy. The fact that the young nanny has thought fit to hide the kitchen knives. The way that, as her plans unfold, her sense of purpose becomes more defined. For the final slaughter she changes into the plastic uniform of the butcher in the abattoir. Still she falters. It takes three attempts before she can kill her sons, obliterate the future and all hope of happiness. This Medea is about the failure of romantic love, the breaking of promises and the canker at the heart of male/female relationships: what men want and what women need. In the perspex palace where country and western plays continuously in the background, Patrick O'Kane's muscle-bound Jason makes Houdini-like efforts to explain himself to Medea. To have his cake and eat it. It is no-go because Medea bought the whole romantic myth, she believed the promises and the songs. Her madness is that, despite everything, she would still have him back. The approach makes the play smaller, but also bigger. It is no longer a tornado of terror and pity, but an appalling domestic tragedy. This is the first Medea I've ever seen that I've wanted to cradle in my arms. At the end, Medea stands behind the despairing Jason, flicking water at him, trying to get his attention. The dead children's sailing boats still bob upon the water. After everything, the hunger of Medea's want for Jason is frightening, like a child's. That is real madness. And real horror. \u0095 At the Abbey, Dublin (00 3531 878 7222), till July 1.",

Now that ENO has taken the plunge, reviving the superb staging that Peter Sellars created for the premiere in Houston in 1987 (and which the American company brought to the Edinburgh festival a year later), all opera-goers should give thanks, and make sure they get to see what is a gripping and often wildly entertaining event, superbly realised both musically and dramatically at the Coliseum. </p> <p>Nixon in China has been heard in London before - Kent Nagano conducted the LSO in a concert performance three years ago. Experiencing it in all its splendour in an opera house, however, makes the achievement of Adams and his librettist Alice Goodman seem all the more impressive. Sellars, too, played a crucial part in the work's genesis. It was he who suggested to Adams that Richard Nixon's visit to Beijing in 1972 might be the starting point for a stage work, and it was he who brought composer and librettist together. As realised by Goodman in her wonderfully fluid, vivid text, this historic event becomes the stuff of opera on the grandest scale. With its focus shifting between the public and private worlds of the protagonists, its vivid tableaux and dance episodes, it echoes the scale and scope of Don Carlos. </p> <p>But Nixon has one ingredient that Verdi's masterpiece lacks. Adams may have set out to write a \"heroic\" opera, peopled with larger-than-life figures, but there is a wicked vein of humour running through music, text and production that pricks the pomposity of all concerned. Richard Nixon's platitudes and his transparent ambition to use the PR, pre-Watergate, to get himself re-elected for a second term, is counterpointed with the doddering Chairman Mao's endless stream of metaphors. Madame Mao and Henry Kissinger are portrayed as monsters of different kinds - she a terrifyingly cruel ideologue, he a cold and calculating schemer. Only the Chinese prime minister, Chou En-Lai, whose insomniac eloquence ends the opera, and Pat Nixon, whose contact with the ordinary people of China and her horrified reaction to t he propagandist ballet The Red Detachment of Women (outstandingly choreographed by Mark Morris) are genuinely touching, attain real human form. </p> <p>All this is wonderfully captured in Adams's score; his dramatic pacing is so sure (though a couple of scenes are too long), it's hard to believe that this was his first opera. There are moments of tremendous grandeur - the touchdown of Nixon's plane is portrayed in brassy magnificence - alongside passages of highly coloured pastiche. Paul Daniel and the ENO Orchestra ensure that no element of Adams's rich tapestry is overlooked. </p> <p>As always, Sellars has revived his staging personally in Adrianne Lobel's sets, tightening every detail and making the focus as sharp as possible. He does not follow all of Goodman's stage directions, but his glosses are always compellingly interesting. Crucially, too, he has worked with the cast to make every characterisation totally believable, so that there is not a caricature anywhere on stage. </p> <p>The amazingly high standard of the acting is set by James Maddalena, who sang Richard Nixon at the premiere, and remains a scary lookalike. He captures every particle of the man's insecurity, his desperate efforts to keep his head up in the treacherous waters of international diplomacy. Janis Kelly brings real pathos out of Pat Nixon, and Judith Howarth real horror out of Madame Mao, while Stephen Owen's awkward, self-conscious Kissinger is closely observed. Robert Brubaker's Mao is first-rate, and David Kempster's Chou is a performance of enormous vocal and dramatic stature. The three automata-like secretaries to Mao are winningly played by Victoria Simmonds, Ethna Robinson and Rebecca de Pont Davies. It's a great company achievement with only one disappointment: too few of the words are audible. Though Adams apparently intended the voices to be electronically \"enhanced\", that is a mistake in the Coliseum, where amplification does the text no favours. And every detail of this remarkable work deserves to be appreciated. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Coliseum, London WC2 (020-7632 8300), till June 21, and broadcast live on Radio 3 tonight.</p>",

In part, it's because he has the fundamental sanity of genius: the ability to view human beings, for all their follies and fixations, with a calm, Olympian understanding. This is precisely the quality that makes Shakespeare greater than Ben Jonson, Ibsen superior to Strindberg. But Moli\u00e8re also realised, like Shakespeare and Mozart, that comedy must also contain its opposite: that an awareness of pain, transience and even death counterpoints comedy's celebratory urge. </p> <p>You can see all this in Les Fourberies de Scapin, which Moli\u00e8re wrote in 1671 towards the end of his relatively short life. On one level, you could say it is knockabout farce borrowing the tricks of the Italian commedia. Two young men are in love with girls they fear their fathers will reject. Needing money to help the girls out, they use the servant Scapin to prise the loot out of the skinflint fathers' hands. But, since the two girls turn out to be the respective fathers' daughters, all ends happily; except that Scapin enters, ostensibly on the point of death, seeking forgiveness. </p> <p>In strict plot terms, Scapin's actions are unnecessary: the misunderstandings would have sorted themselves out anyway. But Moli\u00e8re's play is not about plot, it is about the superior wisdom of servants and the assertion of natural justice. You see this in its most famous scene where Scapin, falsely accused by one of the fathers, persuades the old man to escape his enemies by hiding in a sack. Scapin then thwacks the sack with a stick while playing the dual role of the old man's protector and his pursuing foes. </p> <p>This scene becomes the comic centrepiece of Jean-Louis Benoit's wondrously cool, alert production. It has the cruelty of farce as the sack, containing the black-and-blue G\u00e9ronte, goes swinging back and forth across the stage. But it also becomes about crime and punishment and a delight in role-playing. G\u00e9rard Giroudon's brilliant Scapin gets so carried away by the mock-drama he is enacting that he starts to flagellate and pinion himself; and, even after Malik Faraoun's G\u00e9ronte has raised his head out of the sack to tumble the ruse, Giroudon exits swinging his cudgel with unfazed insouciance. </p> <p>Scapin is one of the great roles of French theatre. Copeau played him as gentle and romantic, Barrault as an exuberant clown. But Giroudon, more intriguingly, makes him a rueful Beckettian philosopher in a battered trilby. His muscular, athletic legs are also belied by his wispy, white locks, which suggest an aged wisdom. This Scapin is a natural solitary who has clearly been bruised by life and who, when he tells us that \"it's better to be married than dead\", shoots a questioning glance at the audience. What drives him on is a passion for justice. He beats G\u00e9ronte because his integrity has been traduced; and, when he cons the old dads of their loot, it is as if he is carrying on a private campaign for the redistribution of wealth. </p> <p>Giroudon and Benoit realise the play is not a farce: it is a philosophic comedy. It is also part of a great theatrical and literary tradition that shows servants as infinitely wiser than their masters. It is there in Shakespeare, Marivaux, Goldoni, Brecht and continues right up to PG Wodehouse: as Penelope Gilliatt once said, \"without the appallingly expert European sense of class distinctions, a good half of post-antique comedy would scarcely exist.\" </p> <p>But Moli\u00e8re's wise comedy goes even beyond an assertion of the moral and practical wisdom of servants. At the end, as the reunited fathers and children dance off in celebration, a dazed, blood-spattered Scapin is left alone on stage reminding us that, while his assumed death may be a ruse, mortality is an inescapable fact.

      "body": "<p>An unassuming man smiles and sidles through the biographies of the founders of the Modern Movement in art and literature. He introduced Picasso to Gertrude Stein, he was a close friend of Marcel Duchamp, and he was in on Duchamp's \"Fountain\" joke, that is, the contribution of a urinal, signed \"R. Mutt\", to the 1917 \"Independents\" art show in New York. Many French masterpieces which hang today in American galleries owe their presence to this slender, fastidious man, who arranged their purchase as Parisian scout and buyer for John Quinn, the great collector and patron of writers like Joyce and Eliot. </p> <p>This unassuming man was Henri Pierre Roch\u00e9 who died at the age of 80 in 1959. He was an art collector, in a small way, adviser and dealer, a writer and a life-long conscientious - though shy - Casanova. Last year he finally had a biography of his own in France, by Scarlett and Philippe Reliquet (Editions Ramsay). Roch\u00e9 was in many ways a modest man, but it was a series of accidents which kept him in the shadows. One reason was his practice of chronicling his life in his journals: thousands of pages of observation as precise as that of Montaigne, or indeed Casanova. There was simply too much to publish. </p> <p>Now fortunately these journals - preserved, like many literary papers, at the Harry Ransom Centre at Austin, Texas - are being slowly issued and edited by a specialist publisher in Marseilles, Andr\u00e9 Dimanche. But another reason why Roch\u00e9 became a mere extra in the biographies of others is that he so effectively fictionalised himself in his two autobiographical novels, which tell the story of two love triangles, Jules and Jim (1953) and Two English Girls and the Continent (1956). The real Roch\u00e9 disappeared behind \"Jim\" in the first - in which the eponymous heroes simultaneously fell in love with a German girl - and \"Claude\" in the second. Both were filmed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Two English Girls becoming Anne and Muriel (1971). The young Truffaut had been a friend of the elderly Roch\u00e9 in the late 1950s and these two films are regarded by many critics as among the most profound in his oeuvre. The filmmaker said Anne and Muriel should be like a film about Proust in love with the Bront\u00eb sisters . </p> <p>The novel was an account of a turn-of-the-century menage \u00e0 trois between the bohemian Nietzschean Pierre Roch\u00e9 and two sisters from a Kent village near Ashford, devout Anglicans Violet and Margaret Court (their last name has been changed to protect their surviving family). It was a passion that lasted until 1914. The love affair began in 1899, when Violet, then - like Pierre - aged 20, went to Paris to enrol at art school. Her widowed mother had arranged for her to lodge with Mme Clara Roch\u00e9. Pierre's mother, also a widow, thought Violet so plain that it was safe to allow Pierre to show her the sights. But Pierre was definitely interested in this girl, whom he described in his journal as boyish - and as a refreshingly good listener compared to quick-witted Parisian coquettes. He was interested in having an English girlfriend in emulation of his favourite poet, Jules Laforgue, who married a red-haired London girl. Laforgue declared: \"There are three sexes - men, women and English girls; and I want English girls.\" </p> <p>Violet was a brunette but she said her sister, a year older, was red-haired and wonderful: better at everything. Inspired by Violet's heroine worship, Pierre manoeuvred his mother into vacationing with the Courts at a holiday cottage in North Wales, near Conway Castle. Margaret was indeed beautiful, cleverer than Violet, religious, but an avid reader of Dar win, and abundantly red-haired. It was a perfect summer, with beach games, conversations about books (he recommended Zola's Germinal), language lessons, and naked sea-bathing, the sisters disrobing and swimming further up the estuary. They were like male friends, unaware of Pierre's desire to kiss the nape of Margaret's neck. He became the sisters' tame European. \"M le Continent, bonjour,\" they ceremoniously said at breakfast. </p> <p>The affection grew when Mrs Court decided she and Margaret should accompany Violet to Paris for a few months. Pierre therefore introduced the sisters to French students, including his best friend Jo Jouanin, who read them Laforgue's poetry. They saw sculpture (Rodin), went to the opera (Charpentier's Louise) and learned about French morality. Pierre told Margaret that there was such a thing as sex distinct from love and that sexual affairs for pleasure were socially tolerated. He also explained that he was a socialist and believed that the confinement of women to one man in bourgeois marriage was a tyranny typical of property-based capitalism. </p> <p>He did not yet say to her that he had experimented with sexual freedom, having tried to share girl-friends with Jo without jealousy. Nor did he say that he and Jo tried to create a \"radiating\" non-restrictive social life, fanning out from family and friends, by placing newspaper advertisements for contacts, especially women. On one day alone they received 100 responses, which they sorted in a rented cafe room. </p> <p>Clara Roch\u00e9 now assessed Margaret as a real threat to her only child. She was relieved when the sisters returned to Kent and Pierre embarked on military service. But Pierre and Margaret were powerful letter writers (he called her style \"Shakespearian\") and their correspondence was intense. For Roch\u00e9, Margaret, politics and England became an increasingly potent cocktail. Pierre was fascinated by the depredations of capitalism and European metropolitan poverty was to be seen at its worst in London. He moved to the east end to live in the student settlement, Toynbee Hall, a magnet for young socially-conscious women like Margaret who had joined the Charity Organisation Society, which surveyed families considered in need of aid. </p> <p>Pierre and Margaret joined up, and, when Violet was home, the trio linked arms and roamed the Kentish lanes - so freely that Mrs Court quizzed Pierre about his intentions with Margaret. Pierre was exhilarated to be treated as a potential suitor and promptly proposed to Margaret. She refused, bewildered. How could an anarchistic socialist contemplate bourgeois marriage? When Pierre began to confess details of his sexual experience, she was disgusted. But the more they talked about their incompatibilities, the more of a couple they became. </p> <p>Clara Roch\u00e9 intervened to help Mrs Court prise the couple apart. At a family conference, Pierre and Margaret were separated for a year and forbidden even to write. They consented with uncharacteristic meekness. But at Toynbee Hall, Pierre's sense of mission as a reviser of all values, inspired by Nietzsche, was incandescently expressed in journals which combined lucid self-analysis with sexual fantasy: he wanted Margaret - and Violet - to become his partner in psychosexual experiments. </p> <p>He returned to Paris, where Clara bought him a flat but suddenly, in 1904, his close friend Jouanin contracted typhoid and died. On impulse Pierre ended his liaison with Margaret by sending her his journal of the previous months. It was Violet who delivered it. </p> <p>Margaret had been shaken by enforced separation - she had been ill and lost weight - and was shattered when the journal arrived. On an impulse of her own, she made her confession to him by letter. She wrote to tell him that she was not \"a virgin\". She admitted that she had shamefully \"pleasured herself\". In the course of her social work she had come across an American book on girls' education, What a Young Woman Should Know by Mary Allen Wood and Sylvanus Stall, published in Philadelphia in 1899. Here she learned she was guilty of \"Solitary Vice\". There was some exaltation in her confession, but within weeks she descended into a deep depression. </p> <p>In Paris, Pierre was becoming a success in the world of art and letters and Violet, enjoying art-school life, was mixing with the Russian bohemian set. Pierre visited her in her attic lodgings and they embarked on a passionate affair - her first sexual experience.

      "bodyText": "An unassuming man smiles and sidles through the biographies of the founders of the Modern Movement in art and literature. He introduced Picasso to Gertrude Stein, he was a close friend of Marcel Duchamp, and he was in on Duchamp's \"Fountain\" joke, that is, the contribution of a urinal, signed \"R. Mutt\", to the 1917 \"Independents\" art show in New York. Many French masterpieces which hang today in American galleries owe their presence to this slender, fastidious man, who arranged their purchase as Parisian scout and buyer for John Quinn, the great collector and patron of writers like Joyce and Eliot. This unassuming man was Henri Pierre Roch\u00e9 who died at the age of 80 in 1959. He was an art collector, in a small way, adviser and dealer, a writer and a life-long conscientious - though shy - Casanova. Last year he finally had a biography of his own in France, by Scarlett and Philippe Reliquet (Editions Ramsay). Roch\u00e9 was in many ways a modest man, but it was a series of accidents which kept him in the shadows. One reason was his practice of chronicling his life in his journals: thousands of pages of observation as precise as that of Montaigne, or indeed Casanova. There was simply too much to publish. Now fortunately these journals - preserved, like many literary papers, at the Harry Ransom Centre at Austin, Texas - are being slowly issued and edited by a specialist publisher in Marseilles, Andr\u00e9 Dimanche. But another reason why Roch\u00e9 became a mere extra in the biographies of others is that he so effectively fictionalised himself in his two autobiographical novels, which tell the story of two love triangles, Jules and Jim (1953) and Two English Girls and the Continent (1956). The real Roch\u00e9 disappeared behind \"Jim\" in the first - in which the eponymous heroes simultaneously fell in love with a German girl - and \"Claude\" in the second. Both were filmed by Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Two English Girls becoming Anne and Muriel (1971). The young Truffaut had been a friend of the elderly Roch\u00e9 in the late 1950s and these two films are regarded by many critics as among the most profound in his oeuvre. The filmmaker said Anne and Muriel should be like a film about Proust in love with the Bront\u00eb sisters . The novel was an account of a turn-of-the-century menage \u00e0 trois between the bohemian Nietzschean Pierre Roch\u00e9 and two sisters from a Kent village near Ashford, devout Anglicans Violet and Margaret Court (their last name has been changed to protect their surviving family). It was a passion that lasted until 1914. The love affair began in 1899, when Violet, then - like Pierre - aged 20, went to Paris to enrol at art school. Her widowed mother had arranged for her to lodge with Mme Clara Roch\u00e9. Pierre's mother, also a widow, thought Violet so plain that it was safe to allow Pierre to show her the sights. But Pierre was definitely interested in this girl, whom he described in his journal as boyish - and as a refreshingly good listener compared to quick-witted Parisian coquettes. He was interested in having an English girlfriend in emulation of his favourite poet, Jules Laforgue, who married a red-haired London girl. Laforgue declared: \"There are three sexes - men, women and English girls; and I want English girls.\" Violet was a brunette but she said her sister, a year older, was red-haired and wonderful: better at everything. Inspired by Violet's heroine worship, Pierre manoeuvred his mother into vacationing with the Courts at a holiday cottage in North Wales, near Conway Castle. Margaret was indeed beautiful, cleverer than Violet, religious, but an avid reader of Dar win, and abundantly red-haired. It was a perfect summer, with beach games, conversations about books (he recommended Zola's Germinal), language lessons, and naked sea-bathing, the sisters disrobing and swimming further up the estuary. They were like male friends, unaware of Pierre's desire to kiss the nape of Margaret's neck. He became the sisters' tame European. \"M le Continent, bonjour,\" they ceremoniously said at breakfast. The affection grew when Mrs Court decided she and Margaret should accompany Violet to Paris for a few months. Pierre therefore introduced the sisters to French students, including his best friend Jo Jouanin, who read them Laforgue's poetry. They saw sculpture (Rodin), went to the opera (Charpentier's Louise) and learned about French morality. Pierre told Margaret that there was such a thing as sex distinct from love and that sexual affairs for pleasure were socially tolerated. He also explained that he was a socialist and believed that the confinement of women to one man in bourgeois marriage was a tyranny typical of property-based capitalism. He did not yet say to her that he had experimented with sexual freedom, having tried to share girl-friends with Jo without jealousy. Nor did he say that he and Jo tried to create a \"radiating\" non-restrictive social life, fanning out from family and friends, by placing newspaper advertisements for contacts, especially women. On one day alone they received 100 responses, which they sorted in a rented cafe room. Clara Roch\u00e9 now assessed Margaret as a real threat to her only child. She was relieved when the sisters returned to Kent and Pierre embarked on military service. But Pierre and Margaret were powerful letter writers (he called her style \"Shakespearian\") and their correspondence was intense. For Roch\u00e9, Margaret, politics and England became an increasingly potent cocktail. Pierre was fascinated by the depredations of capitalism and European metropolitan poverty was to be seen at its worst in London. He moved to the east end to live in the student settlement, Toynbee Hall, a magnet for young socially-conscious women like Margaret who had joined the Charity Organisation Society, which surveyed families considered in need of aid. Pierre and Margaret joined up, and, when Violet was home, the trio linked arms and roamed the Kentish lanes - so freely that Mrs Court quizzed Pierre about his intentions with Margaret. Pierre was exhilarated to be treated as a potential suitor and promptly proposed to Margaret. She refused, bewildered. How could an anarchistic socialist contemplate bourgeois marriage? When Pierre began to confess details of his sexual experience, she was disgusted. But the more they talked about their incompatibilities, the more of a couple they became. Clara Roch\u00e9 intervened to help Mrs Court prise the couple apart. At a family conference, Pierre and Margaret were separated for a year and forbidden even to write. They consented with uncharacteristic meekness. But at Toynbee Hall, Pierre's sense of mission as a reviser of all values, inspired by Nietzsche, was incandescently expressed in journals which combined lucid self-analysis with sexual fantasy: he wanted Margaret - and Violet - to become his partner in psychosexual experiments. He returned to Paris, where Clara bought him a flat but suddenly, in 1904, his close friend Jouanin contracted typhoid and died. On impulse Pierre ended his liaison with Margaret by sending her his journal of the previous months. It was Violet who delivered it. Margaret had been shaken by enforced separation - she had been ill and lost weight - and was shattered when the journal arrived. On an impulse of her own, she made her confession to him by letter. She wrote to tell him that she was not \"a virgin\". She admitted that she had shamefully \"pleasured herself\". In the course of her social work she had come across an American book on girls' education, What a Young Woman Should Know by Mary Allen Wood and Sylvanus Stall, published in Philadelphia in 1899. Here she learned she was guilty of \"Solitary Vice\". There was some exaltation in her confession, but within weeks she descended into a deep depression. In Paris, Pierre was becoming a success in the world of art and letters and Violet, enjoying art-school life, was mixing with the Russian bohemian set. Pierre visited her in her attic lodgings and they embarked on a passionate affair - her first sexual experience. But Violet began to enjoy the admiration of other men and was soon also engaged in a love affair with the Russian poet, painter and anthroposophist, Maksimilian Voloshinov. Despite Pierre's principles, he was tormented - foreshadowing, like his shared relationships with Jouanin, the story of his novel, Jules and Jim. Meanwhile, Margaret had begun to recover and went to see Violet in Paris. On the last day of her sister's visit, Violet arranged for Margaret to see Pierre alone in her studio flat. They talked awkwardly, then he was astounded that Margaret crossed the bare boards, took his cheeks in the flat of her hands and kissed him before leaving. \"The ache, again,\" he wrote in his journal. \"He is galloping inside me,\" she thought as her train sped past the oasthouses of Kent. Pierre continued to travel and write, determined to be an art critic, an encourager of artists and a social observer or \" informateur \", as he called it. He sometimes had sex with Violet and they would talk about Margaret. In a letter to Violet, when she was visiting Kent, he asked whether the sisters could make love together. He even speculated in his journal about making love with their mother, always thinking of one face or body over-laying another. A year passed and Margaret returned to Paris. He sent a note suggesting they go to Holland to spend a week together. The night before Margaret and Pierre were due to meet, Violet told her sister that she had some serious news to impart. Margaret knew Violet had men friends, and there were three special ones. One was Max ,another was a boy called Todia. There was a third \"friend\", she said, and Margaret must know who it was. The name of Pierre was finally wrenched from her. For a few minutes, Margaret was paralysed.

Being bright and cheerful first thing in the morning. What makes you depressed? Mornings. What do you most dislike about your appearance? Lack of bright-eyed, bushy-tailed-ness. What is your favourite word? 'Malingerer'. What objects do you always carry with you? Crumpled old Post-It notes with phone numbers on them. How did you vote in the last election? I didn't - I'd like to say it was because I was in Holland, but really it was because I couldn't give a toss. How will you vote in the next election? Probably for Blair. Should the Royal Family be scrapped? Phased-out due to natural wastage. Do you believe in monogamy? Yes. Which living person do you most despise? I'm not massively fond of right-wing nutters or war criminals. What do you consider the most overrated virtue? Temperance. Which words or phrases do you most overuse? Old Monty Python and Fawlty Towers lines, that sort of thing. What single thing would improve the quality of your life? To get rid of my asthma once and for all. What keeps you awake at night? An owl. How would you like to die? Temporarily. Do you believe in life after death? See above. How would you like to be remembered? To be remembered at all is an achievement of sorts.",

But the plantings in front of them with red valerian and purple salvias were weak and fidgety. They needed pulling together with something stronger. Two or three clumps of the oat-like grass, Stipa gigantea, would have been ideal. By way of a central feature, there were stainless-steel basins periodically expectorating footling water jets at one another.

The walls were nice, made of brick but looking like baked earth, solid and unpretentious. And there were water canals and planted beds of moisture-loving things, including gunneras and my favourite \"sensitive\" fern, Onoclea sensibilis .</p> <p>Minimalist gardens are trendy among those who dislike gardening. You can define minimalist as you please. It should, I think, contain as few plants as possible and express a brisk disrespect for natural materials. I therefore did not warm to Christopher Bradley-Hole's Living Sculpture Garden, made for the Daily Telegraph and RF Hotels. The central feature of fissured rock had been brutally sawn to a horizontal, at the top. It looked thoroughly uncomfortable. The boundary wall could have belonged to a building site. Water was skilfully treated, however. Plants all had narrow, grassy foliage. No big leaves. Of course, Bradley-Hole can make a success of many styles, and this one pleased the judges. They would have been branded fuddy-duddy had they denied it a Gold medal.</p> <p>There was a lovely garden by Arabella Lennox-Boyd for the Evening Standard, perhaps her best ever. She loves plants; that was given expression. She is Italian, and had successfully introduced three, grey-green olives either side of the central canal. Also four pencil cypresses near to the front, three on one side, a singleton on the other. And there was more besides.</p> <p>Homage to Le Notre, by Tom Stuart-Smith for the Garden History Society, was largely an intricate exercise in clipped box hedges forming a labyrinth, a platoon of bay globes on tall trunks, and a nice mirror at the back with water sliding over it. Le Notre, a charming man who designed Louis XIV's greatest gardens, died 300 years ago and deserves celebration.</p> <p>And there was an even more palpable connection with France in the Cabbages &amp; Kings and Chateau de Bosmelet garden, a relaxedly stepped affair, with water at each level alternating with generous single-species, oblong plantings. Young cabbage plants, which are very ornamental, were prominent, and two beds of globe artichokes in handsome leaf. The water slid from level to level in zig-zag steps, but the implied axis was finally established at the summit, with a controlled explosion of purple allium heads in an expanding fan, and grey tree foliage (perhaps Elaeagnus 'Quicksilver') behind them.

Organising chaos, so that all looks like a natural takeover of the works of man, yet is pleasing to look at, is no easy matter. This being on the Rock Bank, a rushing stream seemed a perfectly natural feature.</p> <p>It would be a shame to leave unmentioned the Alpine Garden Society's great achievement on this same bank, where the somewhat fidgety bittiness of small alpine plants, even when massed, was offset by vast rocks - real, natural, weathered rocks, one of them unbelievably large.

      "body": "<p>You can buy wine by clicking on a mouse, but you cannot so easily send it back. As long as corks are used to seal wines, there will be incidences of tainted fruit and variance between one bottle's quality and the next. Wines can let you down. So ask any internet wine dealer how they will handle a duff bottle. </p> <p>If you deal with a supermarket, you can get your money back fairly pronto. Thus, if you wish to spend \u00a33.99 on ItsWine.com's James Herrick Cuv\u00e9e Simone Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (\u00a33.99, 16.5 points out of 20), then ask them the above question. At Somerfield, however, the question is redundant. It offers the same product at the same price (until June 20). It has a certain smooth Englishness to it, this red wine (belying its provenance, Narbonne, but confirming the origins of its maker) in that its soft-fruit richness and sveltely polished texture are polite rather than outspokenly rustic. Herrick has sold out to Penfolds since this vintage, so I expect the wine to change. Wines do, when the personalities behind them change. This contradicts those innocent dupes who think soil makes wine, but we all need romantic fiction in our lives, do we not? Many wine-drinkers swallow little else. </p> <p>We also need Tesco and Sainsbury. The former has three new arrivals, all red, which are just about to go on to certain branches' shelves today (0800 505555 for details). Valdivieso Carignan 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99) has lovely, earthy fruit, herby and warm, with a resounding sense of pleasure-seeking demeanour. It's an ample quaffing wine - as well as going robustly with food. Rasteau Ctes du Rhne Villages 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) is drenched in herbs of subtlety yet resonant incisiveness, and the fruit is bold, textured and fully charged from nose to throat. Santa Ines Cabernet/Carmenere Reserva Legado de Armida 1999 (17.5 points, \u00a35.99), from Chile, has a level of richness and balanced tannicity that defies belief at this price. The ruffled velvet texture is very classy, so are the finely meshed acids and tannins. </p> <p>Sainsbury's has Alteza 775 Tempranillo Cabernet Sauvignon (16 points, \u00a34.49), a non- vintage wine from Spain. It's the juicy style of cabernet, vivacious and deep, but it has solid tannins to give it serious presence. Terra Mater Zinfandel Shiraz 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from Chile, gallops juicily over the tastebuds in fairly rumbustious fashion, then cools its heels, courses softly down the throat, before - and, yes, there is a further dimension - it leaves a lush, savoury afterglow.

      "bodyText": "You can buy wine by clicking on a mouse, but you cannot so easily send it back. As long as corks are used to seal wines, there will be incidences of tainted fruit and variance between one bottle's quality and the next. Wines can let you down. So ask any internet wine dealer how they will handle a duff bottle. If you deal with a supermarket, you can get your money back fairly pronto. Thus, if you wish to spend \u00a33.99 on ItsWine.com's James Herrick Cuv\u00e9e Simone Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (\u00a33.99, 16.5 points out of 20), then ask them the above question. At Somerfield, however, the question is redundant. It offers the same product at the same price (until June 20). It has a certain smooth Englishness to it, this red wine (belying its provenance, Narbonne, but confirming the origins of its maker) in that its soft-fruit richness and sveltely polished texture are polite rather than outspokenly rustic. Herrick has sold out to Penfolds since this vintage, so I expect the wine to change. Wines do, when the personalities behind them change. This contradicts those innocent dupes who think soil makes wine, but we all need romantic fiction in our lives, do we not? Many wine-drinkers swallow little else. We also need Tesco and Sainsbury. The former has three new arrivals, all red, which are just about to go on to certain branches' shelves today (0800 505555 for details). Valdivieso Carignan 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99) has lovely, earthy fruit, herby and warm, with a resounding sense of pleasure-seeking demeanour. It's an ample quaffing wine - as well as going robustly with food. Rasteau Ctes du Rhne Villages 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99) is drenched in herbs of subtlety yet resonant incisiveness, and the fruit is bold, textured and fully charged from nose to throat. Santa Ines Cabernet/Carmenere Reserva Legado de Armida 1999 (17.5 points, \u00a35.99), from Chile, has a level of richness and balanced tannicity that defies belief at this price. The ruffled velvet texture is very classy, so are the finely meshed acids and tannins. Sainsbury's has Alteza 775 Tempranillo Cabernet Sauvignon (16 points, \u00a34.49), a non- vintage wine from Spain. It's the juicy style of cabernet, vivacious and deep, but it has solid tannins to give it serious presence. Terra Mater Zinfandel Shiraz 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.99), from Chile, gallops juicily over the tastebuds in fairly rumbustious fashion, then cools its heels, courses softly down the throat, before - and, yes, there is a further dimension - it leaves a lush, savoury afterglow. Sicilian Red (15 points, \u00a32.99) parades spice, cherries, plums, earth, a toffeed ripeness and an urgency to please. Bright Brothers Roman Vines Negroamaro Cabernet Sauvignon 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49), from Italy, is gorgeously sticky, yet not overbaked or overspiced. It flaunts blackcurrants, earth, plums and strawberries buttressed by excellent tannins. Enate Cabernet Merlot 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a35.99) has sweet cherries and gently warm plums on the finish, but the overture is beautifully savoury and ripe, stylishly smooth and finely textured.

Just a few miles up-river from the Greenwich site of Britain's most derided tourist attraction, the Design Museum is to hold a show on the work of R Buckminster Fuller, the charismatic American inventor who died in 1983. \"Bucky\", as he liked to be known, had many strings to his bow - architect, mathematician and engineer among them. But his big idea, which has earned him a name-check in history, was the geodesic dome.</p> <p>Forget the cantilevered dome designed by Lord Richard Rogers. Instead, think of a spherical structure made up of triangles of differing sizes. Disney's Epcot Centre, say, and, before that, the US pavilion at the 1967 Montreal World Fair. Since Fuller got his patent in 1953, around 200,000 of his domes have been built, enclosing more space on the planet than the work of any other architect.</p> <p>While Fuller's interests ranged from teaching to transport, Plato to plumbing, his life's work was dominated by housing. As early as 1927, he predicted the homes shortage that would emerge in the US in 1944. Fuller also wanted to see the world's resources used more efficiently and, to this end, set about designing revolutionary buildings that would maximise space and minimise materials and energy. In 1929, he conceived the \"Dymaxion\" house, a hexagonal-shaped building radiating from a central mast. The Dymaxion bathroom would follow, a \"wet cell\" rather like that in an aeroplane, but bigger. And, by the late 40s, he had perfected his idea for a geodesic dome.</p> <p>This grid of intersecting arcs distributed weight in the most economical way possible (\"geodesic\" lines mark the shortest distance across a globe between given points). Using lightweight materials such as aluminium, the dome was aerodynamic, which meant it stood up to the wind, while its spherical shape enclosed more space in less surface area. In comparison, the traditional comfy notion of bricks, mortar, timber and tile, realised as an oblong or square, didn't get a look in.</p> <p>Though Fuller went on to build many domes, he would never fulfil a dream to mass-produce them. But the idea would never fall into obscurity - thanks, in some measure, to the hippy generation. Fuller would have been well into his 70s when the 60s was in full swing, but his ideas - such as saving the planet's resources, diverting the energy from weapons manufacture into that of housing (\"Livingry\", he called it), and trading individual gain for mass welfare - were just as popular as the Pill.</p> <p>This, according to one of the largest of America's 40-odd dome manufacturers, is reflected in buying habits today. \"A lot of people in the 60s who were counter-culture types fell in love with them because they're eco-friendly and their shape is very spiritual - there is a lot of native dwelling that is round, the world is round . . . that kind of thing,\" says Jim Hawkins of Oregon Dome Inc. \"Now these people are in their 40s and 50s, have a bit of money and are coming back to us.\"</p> <p>Oregon sells some 70 buildings a year in kit form and, says Hawkins, they cost around $10 (\u00a37) per foot less than standard buildings.

(The Americans like to fit their own bathrooms, while a recent consignment to Japan wanted much of the interior supplied, too.) Then there is the cost of putting up the structure - anything between $70,000 (\u00a346,000) and $200,000 (\u00a3132,000), depending on how much work you do yourself.</p> <p>Besides ageing hippies, says Hawkins, Oregon's other main clients are people who live in areas of severe weather - such as tornado zones in the south-east states and very hot or very cold areas such as Arizona or the Rocky Mountains.</p> <p>\"Most dome houses are in places people think of as back-to-nature places - Maine, Oregon, Washington state,\" says Kathy Schrock, a dome-house owner since 1987.</p> <p>While alternative lifestyle enthusiasts are drawn to such houses, there are also many \"ordinary Americans\", herself included, who own them - sometimes as second homes.</p> <p>She is impressed with her dome, she says, but it is not perfect.

Because of all the joins needed between all those triangles, there are more places that need sealing than a conventional home, and they are more prone to leaks. At Brithdir Mawr, a sustainably-managed community in South Wales, there is a dome home built by local company Geodomes. According to Tony Wrench, one of the members of the community of \"13 adults and lots of teenagers and one newborn baby\", they have cured the leaking by spending a fortune on the seals. \"You can design it by computer, but you need pretty skilled labour to make them watertight,\" says Wrench.</p> <p>Whatever their disadvantages, these domes have few equals as lightweight, space- and energy-efficient (up to 30% saving on bills, claims Oregon Domes), quickly-erected structures that will withstand the worst of weather.

      "body": "<p>There was a time when a woman without a husband find herself consigned and resigned to childlessness. For an unmarried woman to have a child was a brave decision, or an accident to be made the most of. But, in just a couple of generations, there has been a transformation in the self-image of single mothers - from the shame and secrecy of \"being caught out\" to the quiet pride of going it alone. And now, at the start of the 21st century - when divorce has become commonplace and many women bring up children virtually single-handed - a new type of family is appearing.</p> <p>Increasing numbers of heterosexual women in the thirties are deciding to do without a man, and are choosing to have children on their own. Women who don't find Mr Right no longer have to settle for Mr You'll Have To Do, nor \"accidentally\" get pregnant by a lover reluctant to commit. They no longer have to accept that, if they cannot find a suitable partner, they'll never have children, either.</p> <p>Donor insemination (DI) for single women has made it possible to have a baby without so much as setting eyes on the father. The relationship has been reduced to a biological transaction. With no emotional trauma, deceit or messy sexual shenanigans, it is a kind of immaculate conception. How fitting that our own 21st-century Madonna was reported to have been considering DI for her second child, until Guy Ritchie came along. The Artes Clinic in Rome has claimed to have had enquiries from other equally high-profile women. There's even a new TV sitcom, Oh Baby, starring a woman, with an uncommitted boyfriend, a ticking bodyclock and . . . a DI baby. So, with the old patriarchal family collapsing and science giving women a new path to reproduction, is the 21st century going to mark a radical shift in the relationship between men and women?</p> <p>Hospital chef Caroline Webb was just 28 when she gave up hope of finding a suitable partner and made the decision to have a baby on her own through DI. She says, \"I always assumed I'd work for a bit, meet someone and then have children at about 24. One by one, it happened to all my friends, but not to me. I don't know where the years went. I saw someone on and off from when I was 20 to 27, but he was a real womaniser. I used to go out to pubs and clubs, but never found anyone on a par, or stronger, than me. The few boyfriends I had were off as soon as I mentioned children. At the Mothers and Toddlers, I wouldn't want any of my friends' husbands. One's really boring, another's selfish and immature, and the third is always in debt. Men have always been a big disappointment.\"</p> <p>Now 30, Caroline has a 16-month-old daughter, Eleanor, and they live in a two-bedroom house on the south coast. \"My sister's a nurse, and as soon as she told me about donor insemination I went straight to my doctor,\" she says. He referred Caroline to the private Esperance Hospital, in Eastbourne, where, after the standard counselling session, they agreed to treat her.</p> <p>\"Because you have to justify yourself, you think all the issues through. I asked myself how hard it would be for the child and came to the conclusion that it's much harder for children whose fathers suddenly disappear from their lives. At least there'd be no upset in the home and my child would benefit from my happiness.\" As Caroline was single, the clinic asked her to write down her colouring, height and build so they could match her with a similar-looking sperm donor. \"My mother came with me when I went in for insemination - it was a bit like having a smear - and I got pregnant on the second attempt.</p> <p>\"The first time I held Ellie, I whispered, 'I'm your Mummy and I'm so happy to have you.' People say we have the same face shape, but she's much better-looking than me! And she doesn't have our family build - she must be slight, like her father. It would have been nice to see a picture of him.\"</p> <p>Ellie bangs on the kitchen door to get Caroline to open it and runs in, pointing to the top of the units for her favourite cereal. \"When you're one to one with a child, you talk to them as you would to an adult,\" says Caroline. \"At 13 months, Mum used to say to her, 'Come in, Ellie, and shut the door', and she would!</p> <p>\"I hope Ellie will feel she's had a good upbringing and is very loved,\" Caroline continues, \"but I am worried she might resent me for what I've done, and get upset and frustrated that she can't trace her father. I shall say, 'You're special and I have as much love for you as two parents.' But I expect she'll always feel there's a missing part of her. I've reserved some sperm from the same donor so that, if I have another child, they'll have the same parents and be the same blood. They'll look similar and feel close. When I'm no longer here, they'll have each other.\"</p> <p>Even if she doesn't have another child, she feels the family unit is complete. \"Having Ellie has taken the edge off finding a partner. She's the most important thing in my life now.\" And she's pleased to go public about Ellie's conception. \"I want to balance out all the negative stuff you read about single mums,\" she says. \"I'm proud of what I've done and I want the world to see.\"</p> <p>The existence of a group called Single Mothers By Choice - with 3,000 members across America, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Japan and Israel, and two-thirds of whom have conceived through donor insemination - would have been unthinkable two decades ago. Since the 70s, the rate of mothers in England and Wales not registering the father's name on the birth certificate has almost doubled - from just below 28,000 in 1978 to nearly 50,000 in 1998. This year, one in seven mothers will be leaving the space under \"Father\" blank. Even allowing for the certificates that are re-registered at a later date to include the father's details, it's clear that something is happening.</p> <p>There are no official figures for the number of British women having DI, but a spokeswoman for the Donor Conception Network confirms, \"Five years ago, hardly any fertility clinics were providing DI for single women. Today, around a third do. In the past two years, especially, it has become more common.\" Between 1987 and 1998, the Bridge Centre in London, one of the UK's largest infertility clinics, has treated 122 heterosexual single women (47% of whom became pregnant).</p> <p>So why are increasing numbers of women having children on their own? They are largely women in their thirties - the transitional generation brought up to believe that they could and, indeed, should have it all. With a whole world of opportunities denied to their mothers, some saw good reason to postpone having children for their careers - or just to extend the fun and fecklessness for as long as possible. Others have spent years in ultimately fruitless relationships and, when they become single again, don't have the time or the optimism to start searching for suitable father material. Some have such high expectations that they spend years sifting through and rejecting men, then turn around and realise that there isn't enough time left to find the ideal mate from an an ever-dwindling pool.</p> <p>It's easy to be caught out. And it's a vicious trick that, at 40, a woman can feel 20 and look 30, but her reproductive organs are heading for retirement.</p> <p>The Donor Conception Network says, \"Half our enquiries are from single, middle-class 33- to 40-year-olds who are working and financially independent. They'd prefer to be in a relationship, but haven't found the right person and feel the clock is ticking. They're not ashamed of what they have done, but usually don't want to reveal their circumstances to work colleagues.\"</p> <p>Tellingly, the three women who agreed to be photographed are full-time mothers, outside the working system, and less vulnerable to what people think of them. Only \"Laura\", as I will call her, a part-time teacher, wished to be anonymous.</p> <p>Forty-four-year-old Londoner Viki Matten says, \"I'm prepared to 'come out' to show people that women who choose to be single mothers through DI are not raving man-haters. I'm an ordinary, middle-class woman. The more people talk about DI, the more acceptable it's becoming. In an ideal world, I would have liked to have a child with a partner, but it didn't happen like that.\"</p> <p>What did happen is ingenious. Viki inseminated herself at home on three consecutive days with the sperm of three male friends. Her son, Alex, now eight, knows this - that his father is one of three family friends. Viki is completely self-assured: \"The identity of Alex's father is not an issue. First and foremost, Alex is mine, and he knows he is very, very loved.\"</p> <p>Viki spent 11 years with a man who didn't want children, and had already lost one ovary through pelvic inflammatory disease when the relationship broke up. \"It's bad enough if you have fertility problems, or if you don't have a man. But the odds were against me on both counts. The only single men seemed to be the football-and-boozing types. The sort of responsible, thoughtful man I wanted already had a family.</p> <p>\"It was more important for me to be a parent than in a relationship. And I've always believed that one dedicated parent is better than two indifferent ones, so I started to think of ways to have a child on my own. Having donor insemination is not the worst thing you can do to a child. What about all the children who are unwanted or who have abuse or constant arguing in the family? Alex's background is unusual, but he has one parent and two grandparents who adore him, and that's as good a start in life as any.\"</p> <p>It was after four months of unsuccessful treatment with frozen sperm via a clinic that Viki's friend told her that her partner was willing to donate some of his own fresh sperm. \"I was scared of involving people I knew,\" says Viki. \"The advantage of a clinic was that it was anonymous - both in terms of the origin of the sperm and the procedure. But after talking to two other friends and their partners, the idea evolved of using sperm from more than one man to keep the biological father's identity unknown. That took the pressure off all three of them, and made it clear that the arrangement was to give a sperm donation, not to father my child. I hope that doesn't sound hard - I'm very grateful to them.\"</p> <p>All six friends came to visit mother and baby, but there were no emotional undercurrents. \"After Alex's birth, they went straight back to their original roles as my friends' husbands or partners. We stay in touch and meet once or twice a year, but none of them has a special relationship with Alex. He gets no more or less attention than if I'd had him with someone else. They care about Alex and give him presents, but that's because he's my son, not because he might be their son.</p> <p>\"My only regret is that I didn't do it earlier. I had my remaining ovary removed after I had Alex. But we're a very happy little unit of two. Ideally, I'd like a relationship with a man with a good sense of humour, who's kind, strong and generous of spirit. I do know women who've met sensitive, aware men, but the price they have to pay is that the men can be weak and they have to be the strong ones in the relationship.</p> <p>\"I never feel resentful or disappointed, because I've always known I'm 100% responsible for Alex. And if, one day, he says it was all a big mistake, I can't share that with anyone else. But the two most important things you can give a child are honesty and love. Alex knows I love him to bits, and I started to tell him about his parentage from the age of three. Because, if he found out I wasn't honest about the biggest issue in his life, how would he trust me about anything else?\"</p> <p>Professor Robert Edelmann, a clinical psychologist, agrees: \"Families founder on secrets but, unlike most couples who have DI, most single mothers having DI do tell their child of its origins.\"</p> <p>Viki continues: \"Alex has occasionally said he'd like a father, and I've explained, 'That's the one thing I can't give you. You know who the possible people are, but you'll never have a father-type relationship with them.' He seems to accept that. The donors have said they'll talk to him about it when he's older, if he wants. And if Alex had a medical need or really wanted to take a paternity test when he was older, we'd have to deal with that. Most of our social circle know, and people have been much less reactionary than I'd envisaged.\"</p> <p>But Viki is honest about not having all the answers. \"Alex may well miss out by not having a father - I can't imagine not having mine. My mother was an opera singer away from home much of the time, so it was my father who was always there. But Alex has lots of male company and is very close to his grandparents. We visit nearly every other weekend, so it's almost as if three of us are bringing Alex up.\"</p> <p>In the bathroom, above a child-height poster about courtesy, another poster reads, \"Why chocolate is better than men\". You can't help wondering if being a DI baby is harder for boys. With mothers who've got on with their lives without men, isn't there a risk that males will get the message that they're a problematic or unneccessary minority group? \"I've never given Alex the impression I'm anti-men,\" replies Viki. \"But as he gets towards puberty and manhood, I may have to work on the image and role of men so that I can make him feel good about being one.\"</p> <p>Like all the mothers interviewed, she says the parents bringing the child up, and the child's experiences, are going to be bigger influences than the father's genes. Surely she can see tell-tale traits of another person in Alex?</p> <p>Viki insists, \"If I see a characteristc I don't recognise as my own, I put it down to Alex being his own person. Without having someone here to compare Alex to, I don't see or think about the other half of him.\"</p> <p>As the law stands in the UK, children born of DI through a clinic will only ever know one half of their family tree. How are these children going to feel when they discover that their mother has made a deliberate decision precluding any possibility of completing the jigsaw puzzle?</p> <p>Dr Sebastian Kraemer, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist from the Tavistock Clinic, argues, \"The absence of a father may not, in itself, be damaging, but the deliberate concealment of his identity is another matter. A child is entitled to ask, 'Why can I not see the man who made half of me?' A wanted child is very lucky, but the wishes of parents should not automatically take precedence over the wishes of children.\"</p> <p>\"It's a fundamental right to know both parents,\" insists Eric Blyth, professor of social work at Huddersfield University. \"Most of us take it for granted that we know about our genetic inheritance - about two thirds of adopted people decide to trace a birth relative at some stage in their life.\"</p> <p>As a member of PROGAR - Project Group on Assisted Reproduction - set up by the British Association of Social Workers, he is lobbying for a change to Section 31 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, which prevents the offspring of DI from learning the identity of their father.</p> <p>\"I'm in contact with a donor offspring who's in her 50s now,\" says Blyth. \"She's very sorry that no records were kept, because she would have liked information for the benefit of her own children. So there are inter- generational implications, too. We're also lobbying to make sure patients get a decent service from clinics, treating them as individuals, and that high-quality counselling is available to the donor, the mother and, one day, the individual born from this technique.\"</p> <p>In America, at least some information about donors is available. There, solo mothers of DI children are queuing to list their children on a unique registry specifically created in the hope of locating half-siblings born from the same donor.</p> <p>The registry, which lists the sperm bank and donation number used, was started by Jane Matten, psychotherapist and director of support group Single Mothers By Choice, who says, \"With the supply of donors limited and the number of single mothers growing, you assume there are half-siblings who share the same sperm donor all over the place. When we started the registry four years ago, the mothers had newborns and it wasn't an issue. But now the children are four and five, they are starting to ask questions. It was only a matter of time before mothers would try to find siblings to give their children a sense of a larger family.\"</p> <p>Last year, history was made when three mothers and three sets of twins from the same donor met up in a Californian playground. While the four-year-olds played together un-selfconsciously, their mothers marvelled at how similar they looked. Ninety-five per cent of mothers who discover that their sperm donor has fathered another child arrange to meet the other woman and her child - and 90% plan to continue meeting regularly. Matten explains: \"Since most of our members only have one child, and yet very much wanted their children to have siblings, this is the closest thing to being able to realise that dream.\"</p> <p>Amanda Hunt's terraced house outside Brighton is a child's heaven, with Disney mobiles and balloons all over the living room, two walls covered in professional portraits of four-year-old Thomas, a huge fishtank, three cats mooching in and out, and rabbits and guinea pigs in the garden.</p> <p>\"Of course, I would have preferred to have a baby with my husband. What woman wouldn't?\" says Amanda, 39. When David, her husband of six years, finally admitted in therapy that he didn't want children, Amanda moved out the next day.</p> <p>She says now, \"I thought the worst thing my husband could do was cheat on me, but this was much worse. I was 32, angry and bitter. Tricking David into having a child would have been totally against my principles, and I wasn't prepared for another relationship because David had totally shattered my faith in men. So I decided to have a baby on my own, on my own terms.\" Amanda's GP referred her to the Esperance Hospital and, when she felt ready two years later, she started trying for a baby - even though she was only given a 10% chance of success.</p> <p>\"I joked with friends that I wanted my donor to be a strapping six-footer with blue eyes. But staff simply matched the donor as closely as possible to my appearance.\" It certainly worked. Thomas is the spitting image of his mother - down even to the Kirk Douglas dimple on his chin. \"When Thomas was born, I was thrilled not to have to share him with anyone and to know I could put his interests first. I'm surprised when people look at me sympathetically. There isn't anything I can't do, and men don't contribute a big amount to child upbringing, anyway. I feel sorry for women who find themselves single mums through no choice of their own, but it's different for me.\"</p> <p>Once Thomas is back from play school, she can hardly get a word in as he starts climbing over her and demanding snacks. While he's distracted with his second ice-lolly, I ask where Thomas thinks he is from. Without missing a beat, he quips, \"Where are you from? Outer space?!\" and bursts out laughing.</p> <p>\"From the outset, I've been totally honest,\" says Amanda. \"I told him that Mummy couldn't find anybody who was right to be his father, so I went to hospital, and that's where he was made. He tells people, 'I've got a special Daddy', and seems to accept it. Maybe, one day, he'll hate me for it, but I don't look too far ahead. I honestly don't think he'll miss out on anything. Even children who have fathers spend 90% of their time with Mum.\"</p> <p>Amanda is thankful to the donor, but doesn't want to know anything about him, no longer interested in meeting men and unapologetic about being a single mother on benefits, saying, \"I worked and paid tax for 18 years.\" She agrees that her situation is not ideal. \"I'm not saying to women, 'Forget about men, and go and do it on your own.' But we are not always dealt the hand we want in life. I wasn't, and I've made the best of what life has thrown at me.\"</p> <p>She has no regrets about giving up married life - \"new cars, holidays, meals out and a man I loved\" - and says, \"I would be happy living in a tent, as long as I had Thomas. It makes me wonder what life was about before.\"</p> <p>At the same time as demand from single mothers rises, there is a national shortage of sperm donors. The UK's largest sperm bank has fewer than 50 contributors. Professor Gedis Grudzinskas, medical director of the Bridge Centre in London, explains: \"The donor has to be committed - there's one batch of tests at the beginning and another after the sperm has been in six months' quarantine. We only accept 5% of donors who come forward. The others are excluded on grounds of medical history or personality traits.\"</p> <p>Jane Skelton, senior embryologist at the Esperance's assisted conception unit, adds, \"I advertise at Sussex University, and usually get around 10 new donors a year. But at the moment I have no new donors at all, and have to use one of the big sperm banks in London.\" Everyone cites the acute shortage in Scotland, where one man is single-handedly producing Glasgow's supplies. Elsewhere, fair-haired couples are having to use sperm from dark-haired donors, and sperm is having to be bought in for ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Experts claim potential donors are being deterred by the HFEA Act 1990, which requires that their name must be logged on a central register held by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. And subsequent consultations about what information should be given out to donor offspring have led to nervous rumblings that the law guaranteeing donors' anonymity could be changed. Discussions about the possibility of phasing out the \u00a315 payment to donors haven't helped, either.</p> <p>Apart from the problems of supply, UK clinics give out little information about donors, and many women wish they could know more. Jane Skelton says, \"Around half the single women we have treated have specified in great detail what interests they'd like the donor to have, such as being sporty or musical.\"</p> <p>But with women specifying certain characteristics (not to mention American models selling their eggs), is there a danger of reproduction becoming like an outing to Baby-U-Like? Could it be argued that, if 95% of potential donors are refused, we have already stepped into the arena of eugenics?</p> <p>Dr Tom Shakespeare of the Policy and Ethics Research Institute, a new collaborative project set up to explore the social implications of the new genetics, argues, \"I'm not against the idea of single women choosing to have a baby via donor insemination - and plenty of women I know have done this - but I am concerned when babies begin to be seen as a 'right' or 'commodity'. There is a difference between women choosing to have a child and choosing to have a particular child - say, with blond hair and blue eyes.\"</p> <p>According to Viki, \"Striving for the perfect baby with the perfect brain smacks of designer babies and discredits what I've done. I wanted a child for who that child could be. I didn't have a checklist of specific qualities in mind.\"</p> <p>Laura, a part-time teacher living in the home counties, wanted a child so badly that she had artificial insemination 30 times and two miscarriages before her son, Robin, was born in 1995. \"Having a child by DI is a wonderful opportunity to let your child be their own person from the start,\" says Laura, 46. \"You don't have specific expectations. I said to the clinic, 'Just choose someone who's had a good success rate.'</p> <p>\"I had a year off work after Robin was born and I was a wreck at first,\" she admits. \"If a single woman has a child by DI, there's a taboo against saying how difficult it is, but it can be exhausting. I still miss having emotional support and someone to share the joys of having Robin.</p> <p>\"There was always this family mythology that I was the pretty one who'd marry young and have babies. I did have a very good relationship from 17 to 27, and we both wanted children, but I never felt ready. When I needed to come to London for my career, I decided to move on without him. But I've never met anyone I could relate to as well. In 19 years, I've had three relationships with completely unsuitable men. My perfect partner would be emotionally alive and able to communicate, and that cuts out most of them. But I'd rather be on my own than compromise.\"</p> <p>Two years after Robin was born, Laura realised he was entitled to know as much as possible about the donor, and contacted the clinic again. \"Friends had always said his father must be a farmer or carpenter, because he's so passionate about tools and tractors. So we laughed our socks off when I found out that his father had such a similar profession and interests to mine: tennis, photography and the flute. If there had been a catalogue of donors, that's who I would have chosen.\"</p> <p>So far, five-year-old Robin hasn't asked about his father, and Laura doesn't think he has yet worked out that there's another person related to him. She's keeping the information about his biological father in a drawer, along with his birth certificate. As Laura's parents are in their 80s and frail, she's never felt it necessary to tell them about Robin's origins. But it's a sign of the times that the neighbour asked over the fence, \"Is there a boyfriend we didn't know about, or did you do DI or something like that?\"</p> <p>\"I would have loved Robin to grow up in the countryside with a Mummy and Daddy and masses of cousins,\" says Laura. \"But you have to make the best of life, and I'm confident I can provide him with a good experience so he'll grow into a happy, balanced person. I expect he'll throw it into my face at some time, and I'll have to be confident and firm on my feet that I did the right thing.</p> <p>\"But I am very worried that he'll be missing a male role model. His school doesn't have a single male teacher, and most of the women I know are single. The bottom line is, there aren't many men I like as people, although the younger generations are less chauvinistic. Robin sometimes says, 'I don't have a Daddy, but you can share yours.' When I asked why he wished he had a father, he replied, 'We could play killing games.' I'm trying to find good male role models for him in books, but it's not easy.\"</p> <p>Every month, the London DI Support Group members meets up with all the children. \"I'm glad Robin will grow up knowing lots of other children in the same position,\" says Laura. \"Being a single parent with one child is very, very intense, and there's a risk of becoming co-dependent, which is why I never considered giving up my career. But a few weeks ago, Robin asked if I'd had him because I wanted a friend. I can't remember what I said; I was so thrown. That night, I decided I ought to start going out more and called some personal ads in the paper.</p> <p>\"It's interesting that people always ask single mothers why they wanted a child so much, while so many other people have children without giving it a thought.

      "bodyText": "There was a time when a woman without a husband find herself consigned and resigned to childlessness. For an unmarried woman to have a child was a brave decision, or an accident to be made the most of. But, in just a couple of generations, there has been a transformation in the self-image of single mothers - from the shame and secrecy of \"being caught out\" to the quiet pride of going it alone. And now, at the start of the 21st century - when divorce has become commonplace and many women bring up children virtually single-handed - a new type of family is appearing. Increasing numbers of heterosexual women in the thirties are deciding to do without a man, and are choosing to have children on their own. Women who don't find Mr Right no longer have to settle for Mr You'll Have To Do, nor \"accidentally\" get pregnant by a lover reluctant to commit. They no longer have to accept that, if they cannot find a suitable partner, they'll never have children, either. Donor insemination (DI) for single women has made it possible to have a baby without so much as setting eyes on the father. The relationship has been reduced to a biological transaction. With no emotional trauma, deceit or messy sexual shenanigans, it is a kind of immaculate conception. How fitting that our own 21st-century Madonna was reported to have been considering DI for her second child, until Guy Ritchie came along. The Artes Clinic in Rome has claimed to have had enquiries from other equally high-profile women. There's even a new TV sitcom, Oh Baby, starring a woman, with an uncommitted boyfriend, a ticking bodyclock and . . . a DI baby. So, with the old patriarchal family collapsing and science giving women a new path to reproduction, is the 21st century going to mark a radical shift in the relationship between men and women? Hospital chef Caroline Webb was just 28 when she gave up hope of finding a suitable partner and made the decision to have a baby on her own through DI. She says, \"I always assumed I'd work for a bit, meet someone and then have children at about 24. One by one, it happened to all my friends, but not to me. I don't know where the years went. I saw someone on and off from when I was 20 to 27, but he was a real womaniser. I used to go out to pubs and clubs, but never found anyone on a par, or stronger, than me. The few boyfriends I had were off as soon as I mentioned children. At the Mothers and Toddlers, I wouldn't want any of my friends' husbands. One's really boring, another's selfish and immature, and the third is always in debt. Men have always been a big disappointment.\" Now 30, Caroline has a 16-month-old daughter, Eleanor, and they live in a two-bedroom house on the south coast. \"My sister's a nurse, and as soon as she told me about donor insemination I went straight to my doctor,\" she says. He referred Caroline to the private Esperance Hospital, in Eastbourne, where, after the standard counselling session, they agreed to treat her. \"Because you have to justify yourself, you think all the issues through. I asked myself how hard it would be for the child and came to the conclusion that it's much harder for children whose fathers suddenly disappear from their lives. At least there'd be no upset in the home and my child would benefit from my happiness.\" As Caroline was single, the clinic asked her to write down her colouring, height and build so they could match her with a similar-looking sperm donor. \"My mother came with me when I went in for insemination - it was a bit like having a smear - and I got pregnant on the second attempt. \"The first time I held Ellie, I whispered, 'I'm your Mummy and I'm so happy to have you.' People say we have the same face shape, but she's much better-looking than me! And she doesn't have our family build - she must be slight, like her father. It would have been nice to see a picture of him.\" Ellie bangs on the kitchen door to get Caroline to open it and runs in, pointing to the top of the units for her favourite cereal. \"When you're one to one with a child, you talk to them as you would to an adult,\" says Caroline. \"At 13 months, Mum used to say to her, 'Come in, Ellie, and shut the door', and she would! \"I hope Ellie will feel she's had a good upbringing and is very loved,\" Caroline continues, \"but I am worried she might resent me for what I've done, and get upset and frustrated that she can't trace her father. I shall say, 'You're special and I have as much love for you as two parents.' But I expect she'll always feel there's a missing part of her. I've reserved some sperm from the same donor so that, if I have another child, they'll have the same parents and be the same blood. They'll look similar and feel close. When I'm no longer here, they'll have each other.\" Even if she doesn't have another child, she feels the family unit is complete. \"Having Ellie has taken the edge off finding a partner. She's the most important thing in my life now.\" And she's pleased to go public about Ellie's conception. \"I want to balance out all the negative stuff you read about single mums,\" she says. \"I'm proud of what I've done and I want the world to see.\" The existence of a group called Single Mothers By Choice - with 3,000 members across America, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Japan and Israel, and two-thirds of whom have conceived through donor insemination - would have been unthinkable two decades ago. Since the 70s, the rate of mothers in England and Wales not registering the father's name on the birth certificate has almost doubled - from just below 28,000 in 1978 to nearly 50,000 in 1998. This year, one in seven mothers will be leaving the space under \"Father\" blank. Even allowing for the certificates that are re-registered at a later date to include the father's details, it's clear that something is happening. There are no official figures for the number of British women having DI, but a spokeswoman for the Donor Conception Network confirms, \"Five years ago, hardly any fertility clinics were providing DI for single women. Today, around a third do. In the past two years, especially, it has become more common.\" Between 1987 and 1998, the Bridge Centre in London, one of the UK's largest infertility clinics, has treated 122 heterosexual single women (47% of whom became pregnant). So why are increasing numbers of women having children on their own? They are largely women in their thirties - the transitional generation brought up to believe that they could and, indeed, should have it all. With a whole world of opportunities denied to their mothers, some saw good reason to postpone having children for their careers - or just to extend the fun and fecklessness for as long as possible. Others have spent years in ultimately fruitless relationships and, when they become single again, don't have the time or the optimism to start searching for suitable father material. Some have such high expectations that they spend years sifting through and rejecting men, then turn around and realise that there isn't enough time left to find the ideal mate from an an ever-dwindling pool. It's easy to be caught out. And it's a vicious trick that, at 40, a woman can feel 20 and look 30, but her reproductive organs are heading for retirement. The Donor Conception Network says, \"Half our enquiries are from single, middle-class 33- to 40-year-olds who are working and financially independent. They'd prefer to be in a relationship, but haven't found the right person and feel the clock is ticking. They're not ashamed of what they have done, but usually don't want to reveal their circumstances to work colleagues.\" Tellingly, the three women who agreed to be photographed are full-time mothers, outside the working system, and less vulnerable to what people think of them. Only \"Laura\", as I will call her, a part-time teacher, wished to be anonymous. Forty-four-year-old Londoner Viki Matten says, \"I'm prepared to 'come out' to show people that women who choose to be single mothers through DI are not raving man-haters. I'm an ordinary, middle-class woman. The more people talk about DI, the more acceptable it's becoming. In an ideal world, I would have liked to have a child with a partner, but it didn't happen like that.\" What did happen is ingenious. Viki inseminated herself at home on three consecutive days with the sperm of three male friends. Her son, Alex, now eight, knows this - that his father is one of three family friends. Viki is completely self-assured: \"The identity of Alex's father is not an issue. First and foremost, Alex is mine, and he knows he is very, very loved.\" Viki spent 11 years with a man who didn't want children, and had already lost one ovary through pelvic inflammatory disease when the relationship broke up. \"It's bad enough if you have fertility problems, or if you don't have a man. But the odds were against me on both counts. The only single men seemed to be the football-and-boozing types. The sort of responsible, thoughtful man I wanted already had a family. \"It was more important for me to be a parent than in a relationship. And I've always believed that one dedicated parent is better than two indifferent ones, so I started to think of ways to have a child on my own. Having donor insemination is not the worst thing you can do to a child. What about all the children who are unwanted or who have abuse or constant arguing in the family? Alex's background is unusual, but he has one parent and two grandparents who adore him, and that's as good a start in life as any.\" It was after four months of unsuccessful treatment with frozen sperm via a clinic that Viki's friend told her that her partner was willing to donate some of his own fresh sperm. \"I was scared of involving people I knew,\" says Viki. \"The advantage of a clinic was that it was anonymous - both in terms of the origin of the sperm and the procedure. But after talking to two other friends and their partners, the idea evolved of using sperm from more than one man to keep the biological father's identity unknown. That took the pressure off all three of them, and made it clear that the arrangement was to give a sperm donation, not to father my child. I hope that doesn't sound hard - I'm very grateful to them.\" All six friends came to visit mother and baby, but there were no emotional undercurrents. \"After Alex's birth, they went straight back to their original roles as my friends' husbands or partners. We stay in touch and meet once or twice a year, but none of them has a special relationship with Alex. He gets no more or less attention than if I'd had him with someone else. They care about Alex and give him presents, but that's because he's my son, not because he might be their son. \"My only regret is that I didn't do it earlier. I had my remaining ovary removed after I had Alex. But we're a very happy little unit of two. Ideally, I'd like a relationship with a man with a good sense of humour, who's kind, strong and generous of spirit. I do know women who've met sensitive, aware men, but the price they have to pay is that the men can be weak and they have to be the strong ones in the relationship. \"I never feel resentful or disappointed, because I've always known I'm 100% responsible for Alex. And if, one day, he says it was all a big mistake, I can't share that with anyone else. But the two most important things you can give a child are honesty and love. Alex knows I love him to bits, and I started to tell him about his parentage from the age of three. Because, if he found out I wasn't honest about the biggest issue in his life, how would he trust me about anything else?\" Professor Robert Edelmann, a clinical psychologist, agrees: \"Families founder on secrets but, unlike most couples who have DI, most single mothers having DI do tell their child of its origins.\" Viki continues: \"Alex has occasionally said he'd like a father, and I've explained, 'That's the one thing I can't give you. You know who the possible people are, but you'll never have a father-type relationship with them.' He seems to accept that. The donors have said they'll talk to him about it when he's older, if he wants. And if Alex had a medical need or really wanted to take a paternity test when he was older, we'd have to deal with that. Most of our social circle know, and people have been much less reactionary than I'd envisaged.\" But Viki is honest about not having all the answers. \"Alex may well miss out by not having a father - I can't imagine not having mine. My mother was an opera singer away from home much of the time, so it was my father who was always there. But Alex has lots of male company and is very close to his grandparents. We visit nearly every other weekend, so it's almost as if three of us are bringing Alex up.\" In the bathroom, above a child-height poster about courtesy, another poster reads, \"Why chocolate is better than men\". You can't help wondering if being a DI baby is harder for boys. With mothers who've got on with their lives without men, isn't there a risk that males will get the message that they're a problematic or unneccessary minority group? \"I've never given Alex the impression I'm anti-men,\" replies Viki. \"But as he gets towards puberty and manhood, I may have to work on the image and role of men so that I can make him feel good about being one.\" Like all the mothers interviewed, she says the parents bringing the child up, and the child's experiences, are going to be bigger influences than the father's genes. Surely she can see tell-tale traits of another person in Alex? Viki insists, \"If I see a characteristc I don't recognise as my own, I put it down to Alex being his own person. Without having someone here to compare Alex to, I don't see or think about the other half of him.\" As the law stands in the UK, children born of DI through a clinic will only ever know one half of their family tree. How are these children going to feel when they discover that their mother has made a deliberate decision precluding any possibility of completing the jigsaw puzzle? Dr Sebastian Kraemer, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist from the Tavistock Clinic, argues, \"The absence of a father may not, in itself, be damaging, but the deliberate concealment of his identity is another matter. A child is entitled to ask, 'Why can I not see the man who made half of me?' A wanted child is very lucky, but the wishes of parents should not automatically take precedence over the wishes of children.\" \"It's a fundamental right to know both parents,\" insists Eric Blyth, professor of social work at Huddersfield University. \"Most of us take it for granted that we know about our genetic inheritance - about two thirds of adopted people decide to trace a birth relative at some stage in their life.\" As a member of PROGAR - Project Group on Assisted Reproduction - set up by the British Association of Social Workers, he is lobbying for a change to Section 31 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, which prevents the offspring of DI from learning the identity of their father. \"I'm in contact with a donor offspring who's in her 50s now,\" says Blyth. \"She's very sorry that no records were kept, because she would have liked information for the benefit of her own children. So there are inter- generational implications, too. We're also lobbying to make sure patients get a decent service from clinics, treating them as individuals, and that high-quality counselling is available to the donor, the mother and, one day, the individual born from this technique.\" In America, at least some information about donors is available. There, solo mothers of DI children are queuing to list their children on a unique registry specifically created in the hope of locating half-siblings born from the same donor. The registry, which lists the sperm bank and donation number used, was started by Jane Matten, psychotherapist and director of support group Single Mothers By Choice, who says, \"With the supply of donors limited and the number of single mothers growing, you assume there are half-siblings who share the same sperm donor all over the place. When we started the registry four years ago, the mothers had newborns and it wasn't an issue. But now the children are four and five, they are starting to ask questions. It was only a matter of time before mothers would try to find siblings to give their children a sense of a larger family.\" Last year, history was made when three mothers and three sets of twins from the same donor met up in a Californian playground. While the four-year-olds played together un-selfconsciously, their mothers marvelled at how similar they looked. Ninety-five per cent of mothers who discover that their sperm donor has fathered another child arrange to meet the other woman and her child - and 90% plan to continue meeting regularly. Matten explains: \"Since most of our members only have one child, and yet very much wanted their children to have siblings, this is the closest thing to being able to realise that dream.\" Amanda Hunt's terraced house outside Brighton is a child's heaven, with Disney mobiles and balloons all over the living room, two walls covered in professional portraits of four-year-old Thomas, a huge fishtank, three cats mooching in and out, and rabbits and guinea pigs in the garden. \"Of course, I would have preferred to have a baby with my husband. What woman wouldn't?\" says Amanda, 39. When David, her husband of six years, finally admitted in therapy that he didn't want children, Amanda moved out the next day. She says now, \"I thought the worst thing my husband could do was cheat on me, but this was much worse. I was 32, angry and bitter. Tricking David into having a child would have been totally against my principles, and I wasn't prepared for another relationship because David had totally shattered my faith in men. So I decided to have a baby on my own, on my own terms.\" Amanda's GP referred her to the Esperance Hospital and, when she felt ready two years later, she started trying for a baby - even though she was only given a 10% chance of success. \"I joked with friends that I wanted my donor to be a strapping six-footer with blue eyes. But staff simply matched the donor as closely as possible to my appearance.\" It certainly worked. Thomas is the spitting image of his mother - down even to the Kirk Douglas dimple on his chin. \"When Thomas was born, I was thrilled not to have to share him with anyone and to know I could put his interests first. I'm surprised when people look at me sympathetically. There isn't anything I can't do, and men don't contribute a big amount to child upbringing, anyway. I feel sorry for women who find themselves single mums through no choice of their own, but it's different for me.\" Once Thomas is back from play school, she can hardly get a word in as he starts climbing over her and demanding snacks. While he's distracted with his second ice-lolly, I ask where Thomas thinks he is from. Without missing a beat, he quips, \"Where are you from? Outer space?!\" and bursts out laughing. \"From the outset, I've been totally honest,\" says Amanda. \"I told him that Mummy couldn't find anybody who was right to be his father, so I went to hospital, and that's where he was made. He tells people, 'I've got a special Daddy', and seems to accept it. Maybe, one day, he'll hate me for it, but I don't look too far ahead. I honestly don't think he'll miss out on anything. Even children who have fathers spend 90% of their time with Mum.\" Amanda is thankful to the donor, but doesn't want to know anything about him, no longer interested in meeting men and unapologetic about being a single mother on benefits, saying, \"I worked and paid tax for 18 years.\" She agrees that her situation is not ideal. \"I'm not saying to women, 'Forget about men, and go and do it on your own.' But we are not always dealt the hand we want in life. I wasn't, and I've made the best of what life has thrown at me.\" She has no regrets about giving up married life - \"new cars, holidays, meals out and a man I loved\" - and says, \"I would be happy living in a tent, as long as I had Thomas. It makes me wonder what life was about before.\" At the same time as demand from single mothers rises, there is a national shortage of sperm donors. The UK's largest sperm bank has fewer than 50 contributors. Professor Gedis Grudzinskas, medical director of the Bridge Centre in London, explains: \"The donor has to be committed - there's one batch of tests at the beginning and another after the sperm has been in six months' quarantine. We only accept 5% of donors who come forward. The others are excluded on grounds of medical history or personality traits.\" Jane Skelton, senior embryologist at the Esperance's assisted conception unit, adds, \"I advertise at Sussex University, and usually get around 10 new donors a year. But at the moment I have no new donors at all, and have to use one of the big sperm banks in London.\" Everyone cites the acute shortage in Scotland, where one man is single-handedly producing Glasgow's supplies. Elsewhere, fair-haired couples are having to use sperm from dark-haired donors, and sperm is having to be bought in for ethnic minorities. Experts claim potential donors are being deterred by the HFEA Act 1990, which requires that their name must be logged on a central register held by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. And subsequent consultations about what information should be given out to donor offspring have led to nervous rumblings that the law guaranteeing donors' anonymity could be changed. Discussions about the possibility of phasing out the \u00a315 payment to donors haven't helped, either. Apart from the problems of supply, UK clinics give out little information about donors, and many women wish they could know more. Jane Skelton says, \"Around half the single women we have treated have specified in great detail what interests they'd like the donor to have, such as being sporty or musical.\" But with women specifying certain characteristics (not to mention American models selling their eggs), is there a danger of reproduction becoming like an outing to Baby-U-Like? Could it be argued that, if 95% of potential donors are refused, we have already stepped into the arena of eugenics? Dr Tom Shakespeare of the Policy and Ethics Research Institute, a new collaborative project set up to explore the social implications of the new genetics, argues, \"I'm not against the idea of single women choosing to have a baby via donor insemination - and plenty of women I know have done this - but I am concerned when babies begin to be seen as a 'right' or 'commodity'. There is a difference between women choosing to have a child and choosing to have a particular child - say, with blond hair and blue eyes.\" According to Viki, \"Striving for the perfect baby with the perfect brain smacks of designer babies and discredits what I've done. I wanted a child for who that child could be. I didn't have a checklist of specific qualities in mind.\" Laura, a part-time teacher living in the home counties, wanted a child so badly that she had artificial insemination 30 times and two miscarriages before her son, Robin, was born in 1995. \"Having a child by DI is a wonderful opportunity to let your child be their own person from the start,\" says Laura, 46. \"You don't have specific expectations. I said to the clinic, 'Just choose someone who's had a good success rate.' \"I had a year off work after Robin was born and I was a wreck at first,\" she admits. \"If a single woman has a child by DI, there's a taboo against saying how difficult it is, but it can be exhausting. I still miss having emotional support and someone to share the joys of having Robin. \"There was always this family mythology that I was the pretty one who'd marry young and have babies. I did have a very good relationship from 17 to 27, and we both wanted children, but I never felt ready. When I needed to come to London for my career, I decided to move on without him. But I've never met anyone I could relate to as well. In 19 years, I've had three relationships with completely unsuitable men. My perfect partner would be emotionally alive and able to communicate, and that cuts out most of them. But I'd rather be on my own than compromise.\" Two years after Robin was born, Laura realised he was entitled to know as much as possible about the donor, and contacted the clinic again. \"Friends had always said his father must be a farmer or carpenter, because he's so passionate about tools and tractors. So we laughed our socks off when I found out that his father had such a similar profession and interests to mine: tennis, photography and the flute. If there had been a catalogue of donors, that's who I would have chosen.\" So far, five-year-old Robin hasn't asked about his father, and Laura doesn't think he has yet worked out that there's another person related to him. She's keeping the information about his biological father in a drawer, along with his birth certificate. As Laura's parents are in their 80s and frail, she's never felt it necessary to tell them about Robin's origins. But it's a sign of the times that the neighbour asked over the fence, \"Is there a boyfriend we didn't know about, or did you do DI or something like that?\" \"I would have loved Robin to grow up in the countryside with a Mummy and Daddy and masses of cousins,\" says Laura. \"But you have to make the best of life, and I'm confident I can provide him with a good experience so he'll grow into a happy, balanced person. I expect he'll throw it into my face at some time, and I'll have to be confident and firm on my feet that I did the right thing. \"But I am very worried that he'll be missing a male role model. His school doesn't have a single male teacher, and most of the women I know are single. The bottom line is, there aren't many men I like as people, although the younger generations are less chauvinistic. Robin sometimes says, 'I don't have a Daddy, but you can share yours.' When I asked why he wished he had a father, he replied, 'We could play killing games.' I'm trying to find good male role models for him in books, but it's not easy.\" Every month, the London DI Support Group members meets up with all the children. \"I'm glad Robin will grow up knowing lots of other children in the same position,\" says Laura. \"Being a single parent with one child is very, very intense, and there's a risk of becoming co-dependent, which is why I never considered giving up my career. But a few weeks ago, Robin asked if I'd had him because I wanted a friend. I can't remember what I said; I was so thrown. That night, I decided I ought to start going out more and called some personal ads in the paper. \"It's interesting that people always ask single mothers why they wanted a child so much, while so many other people have children without giving it a thought. And we're accused of being selfish. But everyone who has a child is being selfish. We all want someone to love. Why should I have accepted my lack of a partner as a sentence of childlessness?\" In an ideal world, people wanting babies would be able to find someone with whom to have a child and share a future. And that is still the case for the vast majority of people. Despite rumours of their demise, marriage and the family survive, and 60% of married couples stay together. Single mothers using DI are still a tiny proportion. But who would bet on that number decreasing, unless men and women somehow battle out a new set of ground rules?",

      "body": "<p>A man at my local Buddhist Centre in Brighton used to be a hippy, but he gave it up and became a monk instead. Just over 26 years ago, Padamasana (not his real name) was a garden-variety hippy teen from a middle-class London suburb. He didn't wash all that often. His hair was long. When he wasn't hitching to free festivals or dropping acid at the houses of his friends, Padamasana was inclined to shut himself away in his bedroom, re-reading Siddharta and spacing out to the Floyd. His mother, who loved him in spite of this, nonetheless despaired of his sanitary habits. Mercifully, she knew nothing of his drug ones.</p> <p>In 1974, Padamasana felt moved to act. \"I knew I was missing out on something,\" he says. After months of saving and planning, he took himself off on the Hippy Trail to Kathmandu. Hitching a ride in a friend's VW camper-van, he trundled through Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey, into Iran, across Afghanistan and Pakistan, before arriving, after four months on the road, in Kathmandu. There, he re-read Siddharta, spaced out to the Floyd and dropped acid with his new friends. But this time something more momentous happened. A few months after arriving in Kat, he decided his life should take a different turn and, after many years of rigorous meditation and spiritual practice, became a Buddhist monk. Which is what he is today.</p> <p>Padamasana might well get along with Rupert Evans, though the two have nothing very obvious in common. Evans is 28. He's an art director for the advertising agency Bilko Multimedia. Some months ago, Evans felt the stirrings of a formless discontent. A couple of weeks later, he bought a cheap flight to Bangkok and went off travelling, \"to get my head together\". Following the New Hippy Trail, Evans island-hopped around Thailand from Ko Phi Phi and Ko Lanta to Ko Samui and Ko Pha-Ngan. From there, he travelled north to Chiang Mai, then crossed the border into Laos and drifted along the Mekong River to the city of Vientiane. From Vientiane he caught another cheap flight to Hanoi, bussed down the east coast of Vietnam and pitched up in Indonesia. A quick hop through Sumatra, Java, Lombok and Timor led him to Darwin, Australia, from where he went over the top to Cairns, Melbourne and Sydney. Then Rupert caught a flight back home.</p> <p>On his return to Heathrow (Terminal 4), Rupert proposed to his girlfriend Emma, a textile buyer for River Island. \"You've got jet-lag,\" scoffed Emma, but later she thought again and said yes. They've recently bought a house in Acton, west London, which they are doing up. In August, they'll be married.</p> <p>This is the story of two well-beaten paths, the Old Hippy Trail and the New Hippy Trail, and the men and women who've been down them. It is also - inevitably - a record of the revolution in the way we travel and, perhaps not surprisingly, how that revolution has changed us along the way.</p> <p>Journeying has always served as a metaphor for the passage from one life state to another, from childhood to adulthood, ignorance to wisdom, life to death. But leisure travel and, still more, mass leisure travel now seems so everyday that it's hard to believe how recent it actually is. Only 40 years ago, travelling for fun was still the province of the very wealthy. In Middle English, the word \"journey\" means a day's work. For the vast majority in the west, for hundreds of years, travel has implied economic necessity, political persecution or war (as it still does for most people in the developing world). Ironically, it was the second world war that opened the idea of leisure travel to a new audience, creating for the first time a whole generation of men (and it was mostly men) who had actually experienced a world beyond Britain's borders. People such as my grandfather, an Eastender who would probably have gone no further than Poplar on the bus had His Majesty's Army not despatched him by sea to Mandalay.</p> <p>Post-war writers such as Hemingway and Kerouac picked up on the new allure of travel and ran with it. The economic migrant, the political dissident, the demobbed soldier became the self-starter, the freedom fighter, the railroad hobo, the cowboy, the rolling stone. A man (and it was always a man) who cut his own track. A living homage to individualism. Before the invention of this man, it was hard to be different from the pack. Now, all you had to do was travel.</p> <p>Middle-class kids, freighted with the obligatory resentments of their teenage status (itself a novel concept) and with a new set of social aspirations brought on by prosperity and consumerism, began finding the outlet for both in travel. (Though not of the Costa Brava variety that was, in the same moment, enthralling their mums and dads.) Teens wanted more than simply to mature into wives, husbands, teachers, lawyers, mothers. They were individuals now, with an individual identity to locate. But where? Not at home, among the debris of the old order.</p> <p>The 60s was the kick-off point for many a trip. After all, the Beatles were getting gurus and the Stones were getting stoned, and free love was getting everywhere. It was easier to tune in, turn on and drop out abroad. And so travel became part of the great hippy project.</p> <p>\"On LSD, you see monsters with hundreds of arms, like visions of Vishnu,\" says C J Stone, the former Guardian Weekend columnist and author of The Last Of The Hippies. \"There's something Hindu about an acid trip, so I suppose it was inevitable that India became the place to go.\" But how? Air travel was prohibitively expensive and the routes were limited. The only way of getting to India for the (relatively) shallow-pocketed was overland.</p> <p>Snaking 4,500 miles through Holland, Germany, Austria and former Yugoslavia, on through Bulgaria to Istanbul, then across Turkey into Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Hippy Trail terminated finally at the hippy mecca of Kathmandu in Nepal, where hookahs met the Himalayas. Tributaries wound their way south through the ganja-growing Kullu valley to the hippy beaches at Anjuna and Calangute in Goa, and there were odd ox-bows through Morocco, Peru and Guatemala, but the real thing was London to Kathmandu, over-land. No one seems to know who began it, or how. Like so many things in the 60s, it just sort of happened.</p> <p>Eileen Campbell, now publisher of the New Age imprint Thorsons, followed the trail in the mid-70s with her erstwhile partner, Brian. \"There were no guide books. You had to go to Compendium [an alternative bookshop in north London] and pick up a photo-copied booklet, which gave you tips on the route. And that was it.\" The couple bought an ex-Dutch post office van for \u00a3270 and painted it maroon, pink and black, \"like a Rothko painting\". They set off along the trail with the booklet, a pocket full of savings and a few dried goods. As they travelled, they accumulated pet birds, a cat in Iran and, in India, a dog and dysentery. \"Some days, we might drive 250 miles, another day 10. We did it on a remarkably small amount of money,\" says Campbell. The Dutch van was their home for 18 months.</p> <p>Though the trail itself was well established by the time Campbell took off, points along it were still genuinely remote. There was no such thing then as a backpacker hostel. \"Often, we couldn't find a campsite,\" says Campbell. \"People would invite you to their home. In some places we'd go slightly off the beaten track and the locals would look at us as though we'd come off the moon.\"</p> <p>Campbell was in no doubt that she was taking a spiritual journey. \"After my father died when I was 15, I became a confirmed Christian, but at university I wanted to be part of the swinging 60s, and being a Christian just wasn't cool.\" A four-year spell working for the publishers Routledge had put her in contact with Bhagavad-Gita and the eastern mystics. She was spellbound. \"India was like a magnet.\"</p> <p>It was a long, slow trip getting there. \"Afghanistan was like going back into the middle ages.\" The Dutch post van broke down between Herat and Kandahar, and Brian had to hitch into Kabul for parts, leaving Campbell on her own. In Turkey, their van got stuck behind a convoy of tanks en route to the war with Greece in Cyprus. Occasionally, they'd meet fellow hippies making their way back home who would recommend places to stay, and there were certain well-known hangouts, such as the Khyber Cafe in Kabul, but all the same the trail felt hypnotically exotic. \"It never seemed dangerous, though it must have been. There were wars going on, and bandits, and the driving was hard. Some of the mountain passes in India were horrendous.\" Nonetheless, the couple sensed that they had embarked on an epic journey that would change their lives. \"It was just a glorious, glorious adventure.\"</p> <p>At the same time as Campbell was making her way across the Khyber Pass, Jeremy Slocombe was heading north through India from his home in Australia, bound for Kathmandu. Slocombe was an early developer, presenting, at 14, his own TV talk-show on ABC Canberra. By 19, he was the creative director of Canberra's largest ad agency. The inevitable happened. Jeremy Slocombe burned out.</p> <p>He spent a few months recuperating before setting off for Kathmandu. \"That nervous 'breakthrough' made me realise there was a spiritual dimension to my life I needed to explore. Kathmandu was one of the places to do that, a crossroads where you felt you could meet anyone from anywhere. And there were enough mind-altering substances about to shake up your complacency.\" Did he consider anywhere else? \"Not really. Kathmandu was the place to go.\"</p> <p>Back in England, CJ Stone was also shaking up his complacency. While at Cardiff University, he had discovered acid and, by the mid-70s, was working in a steel factory by day and doing drugs and dropping out most nights. A working-class boy cut adrift by his own intellectual ambition, he found temporary shelter in hippiedom. \"I guess I was looking for a guru. And, yeah, my initial impulse was naive, but it was a romantic time. And what 19-year-old isn't a bit self-indulgent?\"</p> <p>In 1975, Stone packed up and set out on the Hippy Trail, destination Kathmandu. \"There were six of us in a VW camper-van, two New Zealand girls on their way back home, me and my mate, and another couple.\" It was the first time Stone had left England. \"By the time we got to Kathmandu, we all hated each other.\"</p> <p>Though they were in Kat at around the same time, Slocombe and Stone remember it very differently. For Slocombe, the hippy epicentre lived up to its reputation. \"It was smelly, filthy, noisy and wonderful. The place had a genuine spiritual magnetism. We'd all get stoned, drink beer and tell our stories. You felt a sense that you could overcome whatever it was the straight world was telling you to do with your life.\"</p> <p>Stone loathed the place. \"We ended up at a lake by the Annapurna Himal, near Pokara. The mountains were reflected in the lake and it was beautiful, but already the huts were turning into hotels, serving pancakes and western food. You realised you were the first wave of what would become a tourist industry. One cafe used to play Elton John. I remember some hippy saying to the owner, 'Hey, you must really like Elton John', and the owner just turning around and saying, 'No, I don't like Elton John, but I know you do.' And there was just this look of complete weariness on his face.\"</p> <p>There were enlightening times, too, though. And Stone met other hippies who were, unlike himself, part of the jet-set. The trail opened him not only to the world beyond Britain but to the world beyond the working class.</p> <p>After Kathmandu, Slocombe flew to Britain and joined the \"New Age\" community of Findhorn, near Inverness, where he has remained for the past 23 years. Eileen Campbell also returned to Britain and dropped out for a while before becoming one of the UK's first and most successful publishers of alternative health and spirituality books. Her partner, Brian, fell in love with Buddhism and devoted himself to it.</p> <p>Stone quickly became disillusioned with the \"game-playing hippy edifice\". \"Angry and cynical\", he came back to a Britain that mirrored his sentiments and dived headfirst into punk rock, which, as he put it, \"didn't involve being up your own arse\".</p> <p>All the same, but in different ways, the Hippy Trail had lived up to its promise. It had changed their lives.</p> <p>The old trail is gone now. A well-worn myth of sex, drugs and the long, hard road now sits in its place. Most of what it represented has altered or disappeared. If the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the civil war in Afghanistan had not made the original route impassable, then the more recent revolution in the travel industry would have made it impractical. Young people (and anyone else) can now fly directly into the orient for less than the price of a first-class return to Edinburgh. And they do - in droves. The number of tourists piling into Thailand increased 64-fold between 1960 and 1998. Nothing about the old trail makes much sense today. It's not so much a pathway to enlightenment as a track back in time.</p> <p>Last year, STA Travel, specialists in youth and student travel, sent half-a-million young Brits abroad - 10 times the number of a decade ago - many on RTWs (Round The World Tickets). Until the mid-90s, RTWs were expensive and limiting. Now they're ubiquitous. \"Airlines have merged into global entities, working together and making the whole thing cheaper and easier,\" says Jonathan Nye, long-haul manager for Trailfinders, a travel agency that focuses on the \"independent\" market. In five years, the RTW has become part of the social culture. \"We are now getting repeat RTWs - people who were first-timers on the Thailand-Singapore-India-Australia-NZ route who are now wanting something more sophisticated,\" adds Nye.</p> <p>An average RTW ticket costs \u00a3800 and, unlike Eileen Campbell's Dutch van, there's nothing to sell at the end. Says Dawn Howell, marketing manager of STA, \"When the student-loan system came out, we thought it would be a problem for us, but it wasn't. Students seem to think, 'If I'm in debt for a grand, I may as well be in for three or four.' If anything, it's helped, because students have access to cheap loans.\" Nye agrees: \"Young people see it as their right to travel. People will accept the debt because of that, and parents are more willing to pay.\"</p> <p>Divested of the more familiar western end of the old trail by the fall in the price of flights, the New Hippy Trail has begun to creep south across south-east Asia into Australia, and from there out to the wider world. \"Back in the 70s, there was more of a join-the-dots approach to the trail,\" says Silke Kerwick, a Rough Guides author and marketing manager of YHA in New South Wales, Australia. \"Nowadays, it's not just Ko Samui or Kathmandu, but a cluster of continents. The trail has gone global.\"</p> <p>But if the trail has changed, then so have the hippies. Julian Ruffle is a 27-year-old sales consultant at STA. This year, Julian is taking 12 holidays abroad. He's thinking about flying to Corsica for a weekend soon, and maybe to Australia and Japan at Christmas. He was in Kathmandu a while ago, \"doing\" India and Nepal, before following the New Hippy Trail across south-east Asia. \"I've wanted to get into the personal development thing,\" he says, \"but I just haven't had the time. Sometimes, I think I'd like to learn - what is it? - Ayurveda, because it would be nice to know how to chill out properly.\"</p> <p>Julian is not a hippy - or at least not in the old sense of the word. \"Hippies took loads of drugs and wore stupid clothes, and I probably would have hated them.\" His work allows him \"a young and free lifestyle\", but he has nothing whatsoever against the establishment and he's pretty much apolitical. Julian is part of a new breed; a realist and a pragmatist. \"I'm doing long hours at STA, I'm taking care of my future,\" he says. He likes tuning in and dropping out for the odd month or two is all. A place for everything, and everything in its place.</p> <p>Silke Kerwick identifies two styles of new hippy. \"First, there are the hardcore hedonists, who I'd call the nouveau hippies, and then there are the faux hippies. The hardcores are more like your tune-in-turn-off-drop-out type of travellers, but the others are often young professionals.\"</p> <p>Julian's friend, Rupert, mentioned earlier, is more of your hardcore type. For a while, back in the mid-90s, he dipped in and out of the Full Moon beach party scene on Ko Samui and Ko Pha-Ngan. \"You'd get up at 11, go down to the beach, have a bit of breakfast and start drinking, recognise faces from the night before. By four or five o'clock, there'd be 20 people in your group having a drink and chatting about which club they fancied that night.\" It was - as Alex Garland astutely describes in his satirical novel about new hippies, The Beach - \"careless hedonism, too diligently pursued to ring true\". After three years, Rupert set out on the New Hippy Trail. \"I felt I was a two-week package boy, where everyone laughs at you and doesn't talk to you, and I wanted to be a traveller.\"</p> <p>A traveller. Ever since the days of the Grand Tour there has been status in being a traveller, rooted, maybe, in the British fascination with exclusivity. How long you stay, how remote you go, how many bargains you strike and how many drugs you deal, these are all rungs on the new hippy ladder, just as they were on the old; \"proof\" (if proof beyond combats, trainers and nose-ring were needed) that hitch-hikers, trailers, backpackers are the modern-day hobos - travellers, voyagers, adventurers, not remotely like (ugh, don't even say it) package tourists.</p> <p>In their efforts to pin down an \"archaic\" and \"authentic\" experience, travellers express a contradictory sense of the consumerist west as inauthentic while making a consumer choice to escape it for a while, as well as the desire to connect with a culture whose rules are surer and more timeless than their own. That's the arrogance of the old hippy/new hippy thing; but it's a kind of idealism and a kind of sweet delusion, too.</p> <p>The sheer volume of trailers has made the search for somewhere off the beaten track increasingly desperate. Stephanie Theobold, a young novelist, recently returned from treading the trail in Thailand. \"People at Ko Lanta were trying to kid themselves that they'd done really well in getting away from it all because their filthy, insect-infested huts were still cheap. Basically, you have to go further and further south. On Ko Buton Leh, there were only 15 or so bungalows, and there were people running like mad from the boat to be the first to get them.\"</p> <p>Whereas the original hippies were pretty much forced to camp or to stay with locals, whole backpacker infrastructures have, more recently, sprung up like weeds in Kathmandu, supported by lavish guide books, films, websites and magazines, all selling the mystique of independent travel while rendering its actuality meaningless. Backpacking has lost its presumption of innocence. It is no longer just young people setting off on their life's first adventure. It's a brand. Marketed, managed and sold back to its target demographic in the same way as Coca-Cola or Nike.</p> <p>Many new hippies, like other tourists, now expect places to resemble the commodified version familiar from their media. Snow-capped mountains, deserts sprinkled with sand-dunes, oceans deep and blue. Charlotte Hindle, of Lonely Planet, \"can't think of any place that's too horrible to merit a Lonely Planet guide\".</p> <p>During the filming of Alex Garland's novel The Beach, grasses were uprooted, sand-dunes razed and 100 coconut palms planted at Maya Bay in Thailand to comply with the film's requirement for a paradise-island-type location. That's \"paradise-island-type\", not actual paradise island. The film caused a furore among local environmentalists, but has been, as Dawn Howell of STA admits, \"key\" in drumming up business from so-called \"independent\" travellers, many of them new hippies. (Incidentally, the novel from which the film was made is about the self-indulgent and amoral hedonism of new hippies, and you'd have to be terminally postmodern to find that twist of irony and counter-irony anything but dizzying.)</p> <p>Under particular fire for diluting the independence of independent travel has been the Lonely Planet series of guide-books. According to William Sutcliffe, the author of Are You Experienced?, an amusing satire on new hippiedom: \"The real purpose served by the Lonely Planet series is not to allow you to find unique and undiscovered places, but rather the opposite - to give you security in that, wherever you go, you can take a book out of your backpack and look up where all the other travellers are hanging out.\"</p> <p>Lonely Planet founder, Tony Wheeler, erstwhile old-style hippy, veteran of the original hippy trail and now a rich man, is happy to admit that \"a lot of backpackers are sheep\". The fact is, this was ever and understandably so - way back in 1975, Eileen Campbell \"wanted to take the road less travelled\", but ended up tramping the Hippy Trail instead. However, the urge to go somewhere no other westerner has visited and, by implication, unspoiled, runs deep. \"I have even met some who use the Lonely Planet to identify places they don't want to stay in,\" says Wheeler. There are no pedaloes in paradise.</p> <p>Some new hippies are more pragmatic. \"I like to get to the middle of nowhere, but if there were no other travellers I'd be bored,\" says Julian Ruffle. \"I'm not one who thinks it's cool to hang with the locals. I'd rather go away and meet like-minded British people.\"</p> <p>The authorities in new hippy havens such as Goa and Ko Pha-Ngan are becoming less tolerant of their \"like-minded\" visitors' behaviour. The perception is that new hippies deliver negligible economic benefits (though studies show the average backpacker spend is actually higher than that of the average two-week Samsonite-packer), are less easily controlled, and create social and cultural problems. The number of arrests for drugs possession among new hippies in Goa and Thailand has risen sharply in recent years, and the Goan authorities are now actively discouraging backpackers.</p> <p>The original hippies were left pretty much to themselves in Kathmandu. A few sporadic protests in Goa against nude bathing by female hippies led to an influx of lone men from all over India, keen to add their voices to the cries of outrage. But, by and large, hippy ways were tolerated. That's changing, and new hippy destinations are increasingly arming themselves against cultural \"pollution\". What used to be tuned in, turned on and dropped out is now thrown in a cop car, turned inside out and dropped off at the local jail.</p> <p>Dr Heba Aziz, a researcher at the Roehampton Institute in London, has made a study of Dahab in Egypt, a low-rent Red Sea resort surrounded by traditional Bedouin settlements. To cope with the influx of a culture so alien to their own, the Bedouin have \"reconstructed [the beach] as a separate world, a tourist world with its own set of values and morals and with its neo-nomadic community\". Bedouin children weave friendship bracelets to cater to the new hippies' desire for souvenirs that reflect the New Hippy Trail brand. And horny hippettes can even buy temporary marriage certificates in Dahab, allowing them to have sex with Egyptian men without attracting adverse attention from the locals. New hippies themselves often require encounters with the host culture to be contained and predictable. \"There is an expectation that, wherever you are, you will be able to get Nescaf\u00e9 and peanut butter,\" observes Charlotte Hindle.</p> <p>It's easy to be critical of the old hippy project. Sure, \"a lot of it was egotism disguised as spirituality\", as CJ Stone points out. Young people pursued the idea of sacredness in India because the dope was cheap and the living was good and they felt released from spying eyes and wagging tongues, but also - and importantly -because the opportunity for a spiritual life in the west seemed ever more remote. They may not have understood that the price of western economic affluence is non-western economic impoverishment, but they did at least see that consumerism had made the west spiritually ragged.</p> <p>In many ways, the New Hippy Trail is a less hypocritical journey. A journalist character in William Sutcliffe's Are you Experienced? moans, \"It's not hippies on a spiritual mission who come to India any more, just morons on a poverty tourism adventure holiday . . . going to India isn't an act of rebellion these days, its actually a form of conformity for ambitious middle-class kids who want to be able to put something on their CV that shows a bit of initiative. All the top companies want robots with initiative these days . . . Your kind of travel is all about low horizons dressed up as open-mindedness.\"</p> <p>Yet it's hard not to mourn the substitution of spiritual aspiration (however naive) for experimental acquisition (however good-natured). \"Young people want to travel for experience, not to find themselves,\" says Dawn Howell. \"They know themselves already. Young people don't think of themselves as having an essential self. You are what you experience, and most of what you experience is a choice between consumables. Young westerners are less likely to pursue the idea of the sacred in other cultures because it is so completely absent from their own. It makes no sense to blame them. The profane world may be all they know.\"</p> <p>For tens of thousands of years of human history, the journey has constituted one of our most potent cultural and spiritual metaphors. In the past 20, its power has faded. We no longer expect travel to change our lives. The journey has become pretty much like life. More comfortable, less innocent, fuller of things and emptier of thoughts.</p> <p>But there's hope. Mark Mann, author of The Gringo Trail and a lobbyist for ethical travelling, thinks \"the thing is not to go further but to go deeper into local culture, engaging at a deeper level with local people and their needs\". And there is some evidence that this is happening. Tourism Concern, a charity promoting ethical travel, has just launched The Community Tourism Guide, listing destinations managed by and for the benefit of local people, while Dawn Howell says, \"young people are beginning to want to put something back\". We are still very far from the point where first-world-to-third-world travel, even by new hippies, constitutes anything like a genuine or fair exchange, but that, at least, may be the direction in which we are headed.</p> <p>Julian Ruffle remembers his recent trip to Kathmandu with disengaged fondness. \"I seem to recall that there used to be a hippy hangout in the west of Pokara on the edge of a lake,\" he told me. He didn't know it was the one where CJ Stone had stacked his chillum 25 years earlier. \"Something happened to the hippies, though. I think that they must have been booted out. Or maybe they just quit.\"</p> <p><b> Old hippy hotspots</b></p> <p><b> Kathmandu, Nepal</b> <br>The hippy epicentre.</p> <p><b> Dharamsala </b> and nearby<b> McCleod Ganj, India</b><br> Seat-in-exile of the Dalai Lama.</p> <p><b> Manali, India</b> <br>Centre of India's marijuana-producing area.</p> <p><b> Kabul, Afghanistan</b> <br>Mid-point on the Old Hippy Trail.</p> <p><b> Panajachel, Guatemala</b><br> Now a second-generation hippy enclave.</p> <p><b> Marrakech, Morocco</b><br> Neither hideous nor kinky.</p> <p><b> San Cristobal, Mexico; Calangute </b> and<b> Anjuna, Goa </b><br> Then, only one hotel on each; now, Bhajee Benidorm - Anjuna still holds Full Moon parties for new hippies, though.</p> <p><b> Gilli Islands, Indonesia </b> and<b> Eilat, Israel</b> <br>As Calangute.</p> <p><b> Ibiza</b><br> Ditto.</p> <p><b> New hippy hotspots</b></p> <p><b> Muang Sing, Laos</b> <br>Once the biggest opium market in the Golden Triangle.</p> <p><b> Ko Chang, Ko Tao, Thailand </b><br> Stoner hangouts on the more remote beaches.</p> <p><b> Ko Pha-Ngan </b><br> Widely dissed by hardcore new hippies, but still attracting 5,000 westerners each month to its Full Moon parties.</p> <p><b> Siem Reap, Cambodia</b> <br>Pizza seasoned with marijuana available in street cafes.</p> <p><b> Wodong/Wairterang, Flores Island, Indonesia</b><br> Great beaches.</p> <p><b> Cape Maclear, Malawi</b><br> Big lake, cheap dope.</p> <p><b> Byron Bay, Australia.

      "bodyText": "A man at my local Buddhist Centre in Brighton used to be a hippy, but he gave it up and became a monk instead. Just over 26 years ago, Padamasana (not his real name) was a garden-variety hippy teen from a middle-class London suburb. He didn't wash all that often. His hair was long. When he wasn't hitching to free festivals or dropping acid at the houses of his friends, Padamasana was inclined to shut himself away in his bedroom, re-reading Siddharta and spacing out to the Floyd. His mother, who loved him in spite of this, nonetheless despaired of his sanitary habits. Mercifully, she knew nothing of his drug ones. In 1974, Padamasana felt moved to act. \"I knew I was missing out on something,\" he says. After months of saving and planning, he took himself off on the Hippy Trail to Kathmandu. Hitching a ride in a friend's VW camper-van, he trundled through Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey, into Iran, across Afghanistan and Pakistan, before arriving, after four months on the road, in Kathmandu. There, he re-read Siddharta, spaced out to the Floyd and dropped acid with his new friends. But this time something more momentous happened. A few months after arriving in Kat, he decided his life should take a different turn and, after many years of rigorous meditation and spiritual practice, became a Buddhist monk. Which is what he is today. Padamasana might well get along with Rupert Evans, though the two have nothing very obvious in common. Evans is 28. He's an art director for the advertising agency Bilko Multimedia. Some months ago, Evans felt the stirrings of a formless discontent. A couple of weeks later, he bought a cheap flight to Bangkok and went off travelling, \"to get my head together\". Following the New Hippy Trail, Evans island-hopped around Thailand from Ko Phi Phi and Ko Lanta to Ko Samui and Ko Pha-Ngan. From there, he travelled north to Chiang Mai, then crossed the border into Laos and drifted along the Mekong River to the city of Vientiane. From Vientiane he caught another cheap flight to Hanoi, bussed down the east coast of Vietnam and pitched up in Indonesia. A quick hop through Sumatra, Java, Lombok and Timor led him to Darwin, Australia, from where he went over the top to Cairns, Melbourne and Sydney. Then Rupert caught a flight back home. On his return to Heathrow (Terminal 4), Rupert proposed to his girlfriend Emma, a textile buyer for River Island. \"You've got jet-lag,\" scoffed Emma, but later she thought again and said yes. They've recently bought a house in Acton, west London, which they are doing up. In August, they'll be married. This is the story of two well-beaten paths, the Old Hippy Trail and the New Hippy Trail, and the men and women who've been down them. It is also - inevitably - a record of the revolution in the way we travel and, perhaps not surprisingly, how that revolution has changed us along the way. Journeying has always served as a metaphor for the passage from one life state to another, from childhood to adulthood, ignorance to wisdom, life to death. But leisure travel and, still more, mass leisure travel now seems so everyday that it's hard to believe how recent it actually is. Only 40 years ago, travelling for fun was still the province of the very wealthy. In Middle English, the word \"journey\" means a day's work. For the vast majority in the west, for hundreds of years, travel has implied economic necessity, political persecution or war (as it still does for most people in the developing world). Ironically, it was the second world war that opened the idea of leisure travel to a new audience, creating for the first time a whole generation of men (and it was mostly men) who had actually experienced a world beyond Britain's borders. People such as my grandfather, an Eastender who would probably have gone no further than Poplar on the bus had His Majesty's Army not despatched him by sea to Mandalay. Post-war writers such as Hemingway and Kerouac picked up on the new allure of travel and ran with it. The economic migrant, the political dissident, the demobbed soldier became the self-starter, the freedom fighter, the railroad hobo, the cowboy, the rolling stone. A man (and it was always a man) who cut his own track. A living homage to individualism. Before the invention of this man, it was hard to be different from the pack. Now, all you had to do was travel. Middle-class kids, freighted with the obligatory resentments of their teenage status (itself a novel concept) and with a new set of social aspirations brought on by prosperity and consumerism, began finding the outlet for both in travel. (Though not of the Costa Brava variety that was, in the same moment, enthralling their mums and dads.) Teens wanted more than simply to mature into wives, husbands, teachers, lawyers, mothers. They were individuals now, with an individual identity to locate. But where? Not at home, among the debris of the old order. The 60s was the kick-off point for many a trip. After all, the Beatles were getting gurus and the Stones were getting stoned, and free love was getting everywhere. It was easier to tune in, turn on and drop out abroad. And so travel became part of the great hippy project. \"On LSD, you see monsters with hundreds of arms, like visions of Vishnu,\" says C J Stone, the former Guardian Weekend columnist and author of The Last Of The Hippies. \"There's something Hindu about an acid trip, so I suppose it was inevitable that India became the place to go.\" But how? Air travel was prohibitively expensive and the routes were limited. The only way of getting to India for the (relatively) shallow-pocketed was overland. Snaking 4,500 miles through Holland, Germany, Austria and former Yugoslavia, on through Bulgaria to Istanbul, then across Turkey into Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Hippy Trail terminated finally at the hippy mecca of Kathmandu in Nepal, where hookahs met the Himalayas. Tributaries wound their way south through the ganja-growing Kullu valley to the hippy beaches at Anjuna and Calangute in Goa, and there were odd ox-bows through Morocco, Peru and Guatemala, but the real thing was London to Kathmandu, over-land. No one seems to know who began it, or how. Like so many things in the 60s, it just sort of happened. Eileen Campbell, now publisher of the New Age imprint Thorsons, followed the trail in the mid-70s with her erstwhile partner, Brian. \"There were no guide books. You had to go to Compendium [an alternative bookshop in north London] and pick up a photo-copied booklet, which gave you tips on the route. And that was it.\" The couple bought an ex-Dutch post office van for \u00a3270 and painted it maroon, pink and black, \"like a Rothko painting\". They set off along the trail with the booklet, a pocket full of savings and a few dried goods. As they travelled, they accumulated pet birds, a cat in Iran and, in India, a dog and dysentery. \"Some days, we might drive 250 miles, another day 10. We did it on a remarkably small amount of money,\" says Campbell. The Dutch van was their home for 18 months. Though the trail itself was well established by the time Campbell took off, points along it were still genuinely remote. There was no such thing then as a backpacker hostel. \"Often, we couldn't find a campsite,\" says Campbell. \"People would invite you to their home. In some places we'd go slightly off the beaten track and the locals would look at us as though we'd come off the moon.\" Campbell was in no doubt that she was taking a spiritual journey. \"After my father died when I was 15, I became a confirmed Christian, but at university I wanted to be part of the swinging 60s, and being a Christian just wasn't cool.\" A four-year spell working for the publishers Routledge had put her in contact with Bhagavad-Gita and the eastern mystics. She was spellbound. \"India was like a magnet.\" It was a long, slow trip getting there. \"Afghanistan was like going back into the middle ages.\" The Dutch post van broke down between Herat and Kandahar, and Brian had to hitch into Kabul for parts, leaving Campbell on her own. In Turkey, their van got stuck behind a convoy of tanks en route to the war with Greece in Cyprus. Occasionally, they'd meet fellow hippies making their way back home who would recommend places to stay, and there were certain well-known hangouts, such as the Khyber Cafe in Kabul, but all the same the trail felt hypnotically exotic. \"It never seemed dangerous, though it must have been. There were wars going on, and bandits, and the driving was hard. Some of the mountain passes in India were horrendous.\" Nonetheless, the couple sensed that they had embarked on an epic journey that would change their lives. \"It was just a glorious, glorious adventure.\" At the same time as Campbell was making her way across the Khyber Pass, Jeremy Slocombe was heading north through India from his home in Australia, bound for Kathmandu. Slocombe was an early developer, presenting, at 14, his own TV talk-show on ABC Canberra. By 19, he was the creative director of Canberra's largest ad agency. The inevitable happened. Jeremy Slocombe burned out. He spent a few months recuperating before setting off for Kathmandu. \"That nervous 'breakthrough' made me realise there was a spiritual dimension to my life I needed to explore. Kathmandu was one of the places to do that, a crossroads where you felt you could meet anyone from anywhere. And there were enough mind-altering substances about to shake up your complacency.\" Did he consider anywhere else? \"Not really. Kathmandu was the place to go.\" Back in England, CJ Stone was also shaking up his complacency. While at Cardiff University, he had discovered acid and, by the mid-70s, was working in a steel factory by day and doing drugs and dropping out most nights. A working-class boy cut adrift by his own intellectual ambition, he found temporary shelter in hippiedom. \"I guess I was looking for a guru. And, yeah, my initial impulse was naive, but it was a romantic time. And what 19-year-old isn't a bit self-indulgent?\" In 1975, Stone packed up and set out on the Hippy Trail, destination Kathmandu. \"There were six of us in a VW camper-van, two New Zealand girls on their way back home, me and my mate, and another couple.\" It was the first time Stone had left England. \"By the time we got to Kathmandu, we all hated each other.\" Though they were in Kat at around the same time, Slocombe and Stone remember it very differently. For Slocombe, the hippy epicentre lived up to its reputation. \"It was smelly, filthy, noisy and wonderful. The place had a genuine spiritual magnetism. We'd all get stoned, drink beer and tell our stories. You felt a sense that you could overcome whatever it was the straight world was telling you to do with your life.\" Stone loathed the place. \"We ended up at a lake by the Annapurna Himal, near Pokara. The mountains were reflected in the lake and it was beautiful, but already the huts were turning into hotels, serving pancakes and western food. You realised you were the first wave of what would become a tourist industry. One cafe used to play Elton John. I remember some hippy saying to the owner, 'Hey, you must really like Elton John', and the owner just turning around and saying, 'No, I don't like Elton John, but I know you do.' And there was just this look of complete weariness on his face.\" There were enlightening times, too, though. And Stone met other hippies who were, unlike himself, part of the jet-set. The trail opened him not only to the world beyond Britain but to the world beyond the working class. After Kathmandu, Slocombe flew to Britain and joined the \"New Age\" community of Findhorn, near Inverness, where he has remained for the past 23 years. Eileen Campbell also returned to Britain and dropped out for a while before becoming one of the UK's first and most successful publishers of alternative health and spirituality books. Her partner, Brian, fell in love with Buddhism and devoted himself to it. Stone quickly became disillusioned with the \"game-playing hippy edifice\". \"Angry and cynical\", he came back to a Britain that mirrored his sentiments and dived headfirst into punk rock, which, as he put it, \"didn't involve being up your own arse\". All the same, but in different ways, the Hippy Trail had lived up to its promise. It had changed their lives. The old trail is gone now. A well-worn myth of sex, drugs and the long, hard road now sits in its place. Most of what it represented has altered or disappeared. If the Islamic Revolution in Iran and the civil war in Afghanistan had not made the original route impassable, then the more recent revolution in the travel industry would have made it impractical. Young people (and anyone else) can now fly directly into the orient for less than the price of a first-class return to Edinburgh. And they do - in droves. The number of tourists piling into Thailand increased 64-fold between 1960 and 1998. Nothing about the old trail makes much sense today. It's not so much a pathway to enlightenment as a track back in time. Last year, STA Travel, specialists in youth and student travel, sent half-a-million young Brits abroad - 10 times the number of a decade ago - many on RTWs (Round The World Tickets). Until the mid-90s, RTWs were expensive and limiting. Now they're ubiquitous. \"Airlines have merged into global entities, working together and making the whole thing cheaper and easier,\" says Jonathan Nye, long-haul manager for Trailfinders, a travel agency that focuses on the \"independent\" market. In five years, the RTW has become part of the social culture. \"We are now getting repeat RTWs - people who were first-timers on the Thailand-Singapore-India-Australia-NZ route who are now wanting something more sophisticated,\" adds Nye. An average RTW ticket costs \u00a3800 and, unlike Eileen Campbell's Dutch van, there's nothing to sell at the end. Says Dawn Howell, marketing manager of STA, \"When the student-loan system came out, we thought it would be a problem for us, but it wasn't. Students seem to think, 'If I'm in debt for a grand, I may as well be in for three or four.' If anything, it's helped, because students have access to cheap loans.\" Nye agrees: \"Young people see it as their right to travel. People will accept the debt because of that, and parents are more willing to pay.\" Divested of the more familiar western end of the old trail by the fall in the price of flights, the New Hippy Trail has begun to creep south across south-east Asia into Australia, and from there out to the wider world. \"Back in the 70s, there was more of a join-the-dots approach to the trail,\" says Silke Kerwick, a Rough Guides author and marketing manager of YHA in New South Wales, Australia. \"Nowadays, it's not just Ko Samui or Kathmandu, but a cluster of continents. The trail has gone global.\" But if the trail has changed, then so have the hippies. Julian Ruffle is a 27-year-old sales consultant at STA. This year, Julian is taking 12 holidays abroad. He's thinking about flying to Corsica for a weekend soon, and maybe to Australia and Japan at Christmas. He was in Kathmandu a while ago, \"doing\" India and Nepal, before following the New Hippy Trail across south-east Asia. \"I've wanted to get into the personal development thing,\" he says, \"but I just haven't had the time. Sometimes, I think I'd like to learn - what is it? - Ayurveda, because it would be nice to know how to chill out properly.\" Julian is not a hippy - or at least not in the old sense of the word. \"Hippies took loads of drugs and wore stupid clothes, and I probably would have hated them.\" His work allows him \"a young and free lifestyle\", but he has nothing whatsoever against the establishment and he's pretty much apolitical. Julian is part of a new breed; a realist and a pragmatist. \"I'm doing long hours at STA, I'm taking care of my future,\" he says. He likes tuning in and dropping out for the odd month or two is all. A place for everything, and everything in its place. Silke Kerwick identifies two styles of new hippy. \"First, there are the hardcore hedonists, who I'd call the nouveau hippies, and then there are the faux hippies. The hardcores are more like your tune-in-turn-off-drop-out type of travellers, but the others are often young professionals.\" Julian's friend, Rupert, mentioned earlier, is more of your hardcore type. For a while, back in the mid-90s, he dipped in and out of the Full Moon beach party scene on Ko Samui and Ko Pha-Ngan. \"You'd get up at 11, go down to the beach, have a bit of breakfast and start drinking, recognise faces from the night before. By four or five o'clock, there'd be 20 people in your group having a drink and chatting about which club they fancied that night.\" It was - as Alex Garland astutely describes in his satirical novel about new hippies, The Beach - \"careless hedonism, too diligently pursued to ring true\". After three years, Rupert set out on the New Hippy Trail. \"I felt I was a two-week package boy, where everyone laughs at you and doesn't talk to you, and I wanted to be a traveller.\" A traveller. Ever since the days of the Grand Tour there has been status in being a traveller, rooted, maybe, in the British fascination with exclusivity. How long you stay, how remote you go, how many bargains you strike and how many drugs you deal, these are all rungs on the new hippy ladder, just as they were on the old; \"proof\" (if proof beyond combats, trainers and nose-ring were needed) that hitch-hikers, trailers, backpackers are the modern-day hobos - travellers, voyagers, adventurers, not remotely like (ugh, don't even say it) package tourists. In their efforts to pin down an \"archaic\" and \"authentic\" experience, travellers express a contradictory sense of the consumerist west as inauthentic while making a consumer choice to escape it for a while, as well as the desire to connect with a culture whose rules are surer and more timeless than their own. That's the arrogance of the old hippy/new hippy thing; but it's a kind of idealism and a kind of sweet delusion, too. The sheer volume of trailers has made the search for somewhere off the beaten track increasingly desperate. Stephanie Theobold, a young novelist, recently returned from treading the trail in Thailand. \"People at Ko Lanta were trying to kid themselves that they'd done really well in getting away from it all because their filthy, insect-infested huts were still cheap. Basically, you have to go further and further south. On Ko Buton Leh, there were only 15 or so bungalows, and there were people running like mad from the boat to be the first to get them.\" Whereas the original hippies were pretty much forced to camp or to stay with locals, whole backpacker infrastructures have, more recently, sprung up like weeds in Kathmandu, supported by lavish guide books, films, websites and magazines, all selling the mystique of independent travel while rendering its actuality meaningless. Backpacking has lost its presumption of innocence. It is no longer just young people setting off on their life's first adventure. It's a brand. Marketed, managed and sold back to its target demographic in the same way as Coca-Cola or Nike. Many new hippies, like other tourists, now expect places to resemble the commodified version familiar from their media. Snow-capped mountains, deserts sprinkled with sand-dunes, oceans deep and blue. Charlotte Hindle, of Lonely Planet, \"can't think of any place that's too horrible to merit a Lonely Planet guide\". During the filming of Alex Garland's novel The Beach, grasses were uprooted, sand-dunes razed and 100 coconut palms planted at Maya Bay in Thailand to comply with the film's requirement for a paradise-island-type location. That's \"paradise-island-type\", not actual paradise island. The film caused a furore among local environmentalists, but has been, as Dawn Howell of STA admits, \"key\" in drumming up business from so-called \"independent\" travellers, many of them new hippies. (Incidentally, the novel from which the film was made is about the self-indulgent and amoral hedonism of new hippies, and you'd have to be terminally postmodern to find that twist of irony and counter-irony anything but dizzying.) Under particular fire for diluting the independence of independent travel has been the Lonely Planet series of guide-books. According to William Sutcliffe, the author of Are You Experienced?, an amusing satire on new hippiedom: \"The real purpose served by the Lonely Planet series is not to allow you to find unique and undiscovered places, but rather the opposite - to give you security in that, wherever you go, you can take a book out of your backpack and look up where all the other travellers are hanging out.\" Lonely Planet founder, Tony Wheeler, erstwhile old-style hippy, veteran of the original hippy trail and now a rich man, is happy to admit that \"a lot of backpackers are sheep\". The fact is, this was ever and understandably so - way back in 1975, Eileen Campbell \"wanted to take the road less travelled\", but ended up tramping the Hippy Trail instead. However, the urge to go somewhere no other westerner has visited and, by implication, unspoiled, runs deep. \"I have even met some who use the Lonely Planet to identify places they don't want to stay in,\" says Wheeler. There are no pedaloes in paradise. Some new hippies are more pragmatic. \"I like to get to the middle of nowhere, but if there were no other travellers I'd be bored,\" says Julian Ruffle. \"I'm not one who thinks it's cool to hang with the locals. I'd rather go away and meet like-minded British people.\" The authorities in new hippy havens such as Goa and Ko Pha-Ngan are becoming less tolerant of their \"like-minded\" visitors' behaviour. The perception is that new hippies deliver negligible economic benefits (though studies show the average backpacker spend is actually higher than that of the average two-week Samsonite-packer), are less easily controlled, and create social and cultural problems. The number of arrests for drugs possession among new hippies in Goa and Thailand has risen sharply in recent years, and the Goan authorities are now actively discouraging backpackers. The original hippies were left pretty much to themselves in Kathmandu. A few sporadic protests in Goa against nude bathing by female hippies led to an influx of lone men from all over India, keen to add their voices to the cries of outrage. But, by and large, hippy ways were tolerated. That's changing, and new hippy destinations are increasingly arming themselves against cultural \"pollution\". What used to be tuned in, turned on and dropped out is now thrown in a cop car, turned inside out and dropped off at the local jail. Dr Heba Aziz, a researcher at the Roehampton Institute in London, has made a study of Dahab in Egypt, a low-rent Red Sea resort surrounded by traditional Bedouin settlements. To cope with the influx of a culture so alien to their own, the Bedouin have \"reconstructed [the beach] as a separate world, a tourist world with its own set of values and morals and with its neo-nomadic community\". Bedouin children weave friendship bracelets to cater to the new hippies' desire for souvenirs that reflect the New Hippy Trail brand. And horny hippettes can even buy temporary marriage certificates in Dahab, allowing them to have sex with Egyptian men without attracting adverse attention from the locals. New hippies themselves often require encounters with the host culture to be contained and predictable. \"There is an expectation that, wherever you are, you will be able to get Nescaf\u00e9 and peanut butter,\" observes Charlotte Hindle. It's easy to be critical of the old hippy project. Sure, \"a lot of it was egotism disguised as spirituality\", as CJ Stone points out. Young people pursued the idea of sacredness in India because the dope was cheap and the living was good and they felt released from spying eyes and wagging tongues, but also - and importantly -because the opportunity for a spiritual life in the west seemed ever more remote. They may not have understood that the price of western economic affluence is non-western economic impoverishment, but they did at least see that consumerism had made the west spiritually ragged. In many ways, the New Hippy Trail is a less hypocritical journey. A journalist character in William Sutcliffe's Are you Experienced? moans, \"It's not hippies on a spiritual mission who come to India any more, just morons on a poverty tourism adventure holiday . . . going to India isn't an act of rebellion these days, its actually a form of conformity for ambitious middle-class kids who want to be able to put something on their CV that shows a bit of initiative. All the top companies want robots with initiative these days . . . Your kind of travel is all about low horizons dressed up as open-mindedness.\" Yet it's hard not to mourn the substitution of spiritual aspiration (however naive) for experimental acquisition (however good-natured). \"Young people want to travel for experience, not to find themselves,\" says Dawn Howell. \"They know themselves already. Young people don't think of themselves as having an essential self. You are what you experience, and most of what you experience is a choice between consumables. Young westerners are less likely to pursue the idea of the sacred in other cultures because it is so completely absent from their own. It makes no sense to blame them. The profane world may be all they know.\" For tens of thousands of years of human history, the journey has constituted one of our most potent cultural and spiritual metaphors. In the past 20, its power has faded. We no longer expect travel to change our lives. The journey has become pretty much like life. More comfortable, less innocent, fuller of things and emptier of thoughts. But there's hope. Mark Mann, author of The Gringo Trail and a lobbyist for ethical travelling, thinks \"the thing is not to go further but to go deeper into local culture, engaging at a deeper level with local people and their needs\". And there is some evidence that this is happening. Tourism Concern, a charity promoting ethical travel, has just launched The Community Tourism Guide, listing destinations managed by and for the benefit of local people, while Dawn Howell says, \"young people are beginning to want to put something back\". We are still very far from the point where first-world-to-third-world travel, even by new hippies, constitutes anything like a genuine or fair exchange, but that, at least, may be the direction in which we are headed. Julian Ruffle remembers his recent trip to Kathmandu with disengaged fondness. \"I seem to recall that there used to be a hippy hangout in the west of Pokara on the edge of a lake,\" he told me. He didn't know it was the one where CJ Stone had stacked his chillum 25 years earlier. \"Something happened to the hippies, though. I think that they must have been booted out. Or maybe they just quit.\" Old hippy hotspots Kathmandu, Nepal The hippy epicentre. Dharamsala and nearby McCleod Ganj, India Seat-in-exile of the Dalai Lama.

Surely the actions of those who raped and abandoned her are what shattered team morale. Again, Chancellor is siding with the rapists; it is just another case of blaming the woman.

      "body": "<p>My father died in early March. He suffered a stroke in his own bed in Kingston, Jamaica. Wind- blown petals from the blossoming mango tree near his window were scattered on his bed. There was a faint trace of the raw odour of new birth from the kennel in the back yard, where one of his six dogs had given birth to eight puppies. A breadfruit falling to the ground and the dogs barking were probably the last sounds he heard before succumbing to the eternal sleep. </p> <p>Death must have come as a relief for him. He was only 74 years old, but he was partially-sighted, and it was his third stroke in less than a year. The previous one had left him wheelchair-bound, paralysed on his left side, speech slurred. He had been living in Kingston for 14 years, after returning there from London, where he had worked as a carpenter for 25 years. </p> <p>Within 48 hours, my siblings - two brothers and a sister - and I had arrived on the island from London to arrange his funeral. We had left in 1964, and over the years each had been back, separately, for fortnight-long holidays. On this occasion, each came with their own emotional baggage. My own included grief for a father I loved and respected, and more complex feelings of longing and betrayal. </p> <p>I had never been involved in burying a parent, and so did not know what to expect, especially on this island of my birth, my father's island. Within days of our arrival, visitors began coming to the house. They spoke with such warmth of Joscelyn Robert Dennis that I almost did not recognise him as my father. They recalled his generosity, sense of humour and strength of character. They included an ex-lover, two boyhood friends and numerous neighbours. </p> <p>His estranged wife - not my mother - painted a more familiar portrait. She recalled a miserly, cantankerous, awkward man with a machete-like tongue. I smiled at her ungracious remarks both in recognition and with the knowledge that my father had not been unaware of his faults, but nor had he been ashamed of them. You either liked him or you didn't. </p> <p>He did not have many friends, but his few friends knew and loved him. Such as Dennis Thompson. Dennis flew in from Scotland a few days before the funeral. I remembered him from my childhood as the only white person to sleep in my father's house. Quiet and reserved, he had worked with my father on London building sites. He now runs his own building company in the Shetlands. In one of our conversations, he revealed that my father had visited him on several occasions when he was a lonely Scot in London, bringing him plantains and yams on Sunday mornings, and showing him how to prepare them. Dennis had made one previous visit to Jamaica, five years ago. On that occasion, he took my father on a three-day tour around the island. </p> <p>The house was crowded the night before the funeral. Pam, my father's niece who had nursed him in his last years, and Edna Brookes - a woman of classical African beauty, who, as she told me, my father had loved when they were young - had spent the day in the back yard, between the breadfruit and mango trees, preparing fried fish and chicken and roast breadfruit and rice and salad. Guests were accommodated at white plastic tables in the living room and in the wide driveway. Music varied from a tape of Harry Belafonte singing Caribbean folk songs to a CD compilation of hymns. </p> <p>Among the guests were many white-haired men. With their erect carriage and snow-white hair, they had the abstract air of men contemplating their own imminent demise. Most of these elderly gentlemen had worked in London. They now spend their days sitting on wrought-iron-encased verandahs shaded by mango and ackee trees, sharing reminiscences of their London years, like old colonialists remembering the mother country. They were unanimous in the opinion that Joscelyn would have had a longer innings if he had taken a daily tot of overproof white rum. </p> <p>The funeral was a simple, unfussy affair. On Saturday, March 18 - which happened to be my birthday - his body was taken from the funeral parlour in downtown Kingston to his church. His children were the pallbearers. Dennis Thompson placed a carpenter's pencil in the coffin. My elder brother kissed the corpse. I tucked in his collar, while fighting with a refusal to accept that the shrunken, ashen figure in the coffin belonged to the man who in my memory of childhood seemed like a terrible giant. In fact, he had been 5ft 7in tall. </p> <p>Havenhill Baptist church is housed in an airy building, with open sides and an abundance of wood. It had been an important source of comfort to Joscelyn in his last years. Among his possessions was a complete audiotape collection of the Bible. A woman church elder told the 200-plus mourners about my father's membership of what she called the Pixies, newcomers to the church who were being instructed in the Bible. He had found community among these worshippers. </p> <p>I read a sort of eulogy, a Herculean task that left me mute for the next two hours because I had expended so much energy repressing my tears. The choir sang a lovely hymn with a purity of voice that was later rather spoiled by the pastor's brazen appeal for those who wished to be saved to come forward and kneel before the altar. Apparently, he did temper his evangelical zeal on this occasion. </p> <p>From the church we drove to Dovecot Cemetery, just beyond Spanish Town, the island's capital when it was ruled by the Spanish. It was a long drive through intermittent showers and the traffic jams that are a ubiquitous feature of the roads in and around the city. Dovecot is a sprawling site on gently undulating land bordered by bougainvillaea hedges and coconut trees protruding from the surrounding land. </p> <p>Several other funerals were in progress. The wet, ochre-coloured soil, rich in bauxite, stuck to the soles of my shoes. The mourners at the nearby graveside of another burial drowned out the singing from our own smaller gathering. The burial ended when the gravediggers had thrown on the last shovel-full of soil, and stuck in the earth a board bearing my father's name. Although a proper plaque would be added later, I could not help feeling that the burial was incomplete. </p> <p>Joscelyn Robert Dennis was born in the parish of Portland, a part of the island famous for its banana farms, near Port Antonio. His mother came from Moore Town, a village in the foothills of the Blue Mountain founded by Maroons, enslaved Africans who, in the 18th century, fled the plantations to the mountainous island interior, where they absorbed the few surviving aborigines, the Arawaks. She died when he was young, and he was brought up with the family of a grand-uncle, an albino, who taught him his trade, carpentry. </p> <p>My father's life was typical of many men from that island. Previous generations had worked on the Panama canals, picked oranges in Florida and cut sugar cane in Cuba, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, creating in those repeated exoduses a Jamaican diaspora. His carpentry skills took him from Portland to Kingston, where he lived in a series of tenement yards, and where he met my mother, herself a first-generation urban dweller. Like previous generations, their sights were set on working abroad. They first came to Britain in the late 50s, stayed for a few years, then returned to Kingston. Restless with ambition, however, he returned to London and we joined him some years later. </p> <p>Here, his life took an unusual turn. He became a house-owner and a landlord. Absorbed in work and managing a house of tenants - one of whom was his lover - he neglected his family. My mother did not hang around. Within three months, she had left, taking my sister with her, and leaving us to be brought up by my father. He now had sole responsibility for three young boys. </p> <p> Many families did not survive the 50s and early 60s crossing to Britain intact. In those cases, either the children went with the mother, or they were placed in local-authority homes. The latter option was often invoked as a threat by my father, to maintain discipline. But as he did not exercise it, it lost its effectiveness after a time. He had to rely on threats of, or actual, physical punishment. This was consistent with his worldview, which owed much to the Victorian values imbibed by Jamaicans in the post-emancipation years. </p> <p>My father had an incredible capacity for hard work. He often worked six days a week, and it was not uncommon not to see him in daylight during the winter. We lived in a late-Victorian, three-storey, terraced house in north Paddington. The tenants came from Jamaica, St Lucia and Dominica. The house was in need of constant maintenance, which he did himself in the evenings, weekends and on his holidays. Over the years, he damp-proofed it, repaired the roof and the windows, installed new gutters and two bathrooms, converted the ground floor into a self-contained flat, built a substantial garden shed, concreted over the front garden, and redecorated numerous rooms between tenancies. And he kept several lovers in the neighbourhood. We, his sons, called him Big D. </p> <p>While some white Britons constructed a comforting stereotype of the lazy, law-breaking, troublesome West Indian immigrant, my father pursued his ambitions quietly. Using a teach-yourself book, he taught himself to play the stock exchange, and monitored his modest shares portfolio through the Daily Telegraph, which he read religiously late at night while the rest of the house slept. He kept a bottle of rum for visiting friends - who tended to be fellow Jamaicans, usually from his part of the island - but never touched alcohol himself. </p> <p>The Victorian ethic of work and temperance were not the sole source of his beliefs. He was fond of black-and-white American movies, a legacy of his years in the Kingston tenement yards of the 40s and 50s, when the famous Crossroads cinema was the largest in the Caribbean. His favourite matinee idols were Edward G Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. The sort of gritty, no-nonsense manliness associated with some of the characters played by those actors was part of my father, too. Troublesome tenants, and neighbours for whom my father carried out house repairs but were slow to pay, saw this side of his character. </p> <p>So, too, did a young policeman. Shortly after buying a Rover car, he was stopped by this policeman in Harlesden and questioned about ownership of the vehicle. I was not present, but I imagined that he gave the policeman a piece of his mind, because my survival instinct counselled me to avoid him for a few days until his rage had subsided. </p> <p>Victorian work ethic and American gangster movies were, however, secondary to my father's passion for boxing. His speech was littered with boxing metaphors. For him, life came down to whether a man had \"heart\". A great boxing match was between men with great hearts. In his retirement years, he told me: \"I've given life a good fight and I'll give death a good fight, too.\" </p> <p>For a time, we, his sons, lived in fear of his violence and his vile tongue. But this side of his character was tempered by tremendous pride and love. How we presented ourselves to the world was, for him, a great source of honour. If he caught us wearing torn trousers, we were punished twice - first for the carelessness that caused the damage, and second for wearing the pants when out of the house. Apart from ensuring that we had adequate clothes for the seasons and school, every spring he took us to Burtons, where we were fitted out with tailor-made suits. </p> <p>As part of this tough love, he impressed on us the need for ambition and independence. He urged us to \"own the morning or risk being owned by the day\". Although he placed a high value on education, he was keen to see us out in the world as soon as possible. We were often reminded of his own upbringing in Jamaica, where he woke before dawn to feed the goats and fetch water. Staying in bed beyond seven, even on a Sunday morning, was for him a cardinal sin. He attached such importance to an early start that it was only in my early 40s that I could begin to enjoy the luxury of a Sunday-morning lie-in without hearing my father's exhortation to rise and face the day. </p> <p>The second born, I am generally considered to have been my father's favourite. I was not aware of this privilege during my childhood, but I now recognise that there is some truth to that claim. At some point in my teens, my father began to treat me differently. He confided in me, told me where to find important papers should anything happen to him. These included, I discovered at 16, shares in a South African mining company. </p> <p>He dismissed my protestation - the result of a nascent political and racial consciousness - with the remark: \"Don't talk foolishness. Where white people have black people working, there's profit. Nothing wrong with me, a black man, getting a share.\" I continued to protest, but without any success. </p> <p>We maintained a sparring dialogue up until his death. I once told him that I didn't want hands like his, huge and calloused. He laughed, and said proudly, \"These hands belong to a carpenter. I'll never be out of work. Never.\" How many times, with my soft hands, but skint, sitting in my studio overlooking Finsbury Park, have I seen my father hold up those carpenter's pincers and heard the arrogant, almost aristocratic pride in his voice. </p> <p>In 1979 I accompanied him on a trip back to Jamaica. By now, Jamaica had become, in my mind, a distant childhood memory, mere fragments. In our motherless household, there had been no contact with relatives, whose comings and goings might have nurtured a more powerful, less fragmented memory of the island. Instead, I had grown up as a black Briton, valuing my Caribbean roots but attaching little importance to a specific place. I had little sense of belonging to the island, or it belonging to me. </p> <p> While I had a thoroughly good time in the five weeks we were there, I saw and experienced little that made me want to extend my stay. Even a job offer at the university could not detain me. The island seemed so small, and wracked with violence and poverty. And I was surprised and disappointed to discover that it is 1,000 miles from the nearest English-speaking island. Moreover, I was young and determined to see something of the world, and Jamaica seemed an unlikely vantage point from which to satisfy that wanderlust. </p> <p>However, that visit was an exploration for my father. Over the next few years, he made several more visits, and on one occasion bought a house. In his 59th year, he left London, leaving behind his four children and grandchildren (11 at the time of his death). </p> <p>With my father now living in Jamaica, I resolved to acquaint myself better with the island. I also missed him. I had not seen much of him since leaving his house. But he had been a bus or train ride away, and I had visited him once a month, on Sunday afternoons. </p> <p>This was not an easy resolution to maintain. Nonetheless, I managed a few work-related visits in the 80s. The highlight of those brief visits was the Easter I spent there researching material for a BBC Radio 3 documentary on the poet Claude McKay. At dawn on Easter Sunday, I watched Rex Nettleford's Jamaica Dance Company in performance. Leaving the event and seeing the morning mist on the hill around Kingston marks the moment when my dormant love for the island was re-awakened. It has not slept since: on cold, wet London days it is as strident as a scorned lover. </p> <p>My father remarried during his final working years. He and his wife, Gennie, lived in an annexe to the house. He had built the annexe himself. The mainhouse, built in the post-independence growth spurt, is a pleasant bungalow with a helper's flat and a soothing view of hills. The extension spoilt the lines of the house, but created living quarters that were smaller in dimension to the main house, but contained as many rooms. </p> <p>In 1992, a year into his retirement, my father came back to Britain. His eyesight was poor from glaucoma, and he extended what was a originally planned as a holiday to secure an operation. While he waited, he travelled around London on his pensioner's travel card, seated at the top of the bus looking at whatever sights he could make out in the city. Although he was physically robust, his sight was a handicap. Nonetheless, he managed to fall out with my younger brother. My father always needed someone to fight. Slightly repaired, he returned to Jamaica. </p> <p>The following year I spent five months on the island - the longest period in my adult years. My father welcomed my presence, but - in case I had arrived there with any notions of staying with him beyond a few nights - reminded me of another of his rules: I had to make my way in the world without his help, and that included Kingston. </p> <p>I soon moved on, staying in hotel rooms, until a friend on the University of the West Indies's Mona Campus rented me her home while she went abroad. Ensconced in the cooler climate of Mona and absorbed in writing a novel, which later became The Last Blues Dance, I discovered a different island city. This Kingston of the early 90s was different from the Kingston of the late 70s. I was, of course, 14 years older, and perhaps more receptive to the city's finer charms. These included numerous art exhibitions, concerts, plays, contemporary dance performances. Rain that fell with an awesome majesty, a magical force, stirring pre-childhood memories. A plant that flowers once a year, and only at night, providing their owners with an excuse for a party, the climax of which is the moment of this annual floral spectacle. </p> <p>The Kingston of ganja-smoking rastas, lubricious dancehall queens and gun-toting yardies was all around, visibly and audibly loud. Jamaica's is a noisy culture. Even the most idyllic spot is often marred by what my friend Carolyn Cooper, a lecturer at the University of the West Indies, calls \"musical terrorism\". One of the means by which the island's poor remind the rich of their ineradicable presence. And the source of a sound - reggae - that, from the 70s to the mid-80s, captured the world's music lovers and bequeathed us an icon in Bob Marley. </p> <p>Rich and poor take pride in the island. Its internationally renowned sons and daughters keep hope alive. Its athletes compete at the highest level in numerous sports. And the many children of its diaspora - General Colin Powell, Linford Christie and Diane Abbott - show what is possible with the Jamaican spirit beyond the island. </p> <p>Yet Jamaica is a conservative island. Authority matters here. Jamaicans are quick to take umbrage, swift to react to any signs of disrespect. There is a vaguely Victorian formality about their manners - underlaid, I suspect, by an African love of tradition. </p> <p>Jamaica, unlike Trinidad, has never had a coup, nor are its politics as riven with ethnic divisions, like Guyana. With more than 75% of the population comprising people of African descent, ethnicity does not have the same divisive powers as elsewhere. And Christian churches, particularly the Baptist, have an extensive and tenacious grip over the people. </p> <p>My father's marriage had become acrimonious. His wife bitterly complained to me about his manners, his general roughness, his cutting tongue. She did not know how to spar with him. I expressed sympathy, but left her in no doubt where my loyalty laid. I tried to mediate, but my father rebuffed me. He explained that she had caused the rift because, while he was in London, she had lodged the rental income in her bank account. I suggested that he should have given her an allowance. He replied: \"Her problem is, she not happy with the milk from the cow. She wan' nyam [eat] the cow.\" </p> <p> We talked a lot about London. My father expressed pride in his achievements there: the houses he had owned; the buildings he had worked on - among them the Barbican and the South Bank; three sons who went on to higher education; the admiration of those he met, such as his doctor, who had asked him to share his child-rearing secret because his own teenage son had dropped out. But he had a few regrets. On a still Sunday night, as we sat on the verandah with the dogs in the neighbourhood barking and the music of an open-air evangelical meeting coming from the distance, he told me that his greatest regret was his failure to keep his family together. It had been a childhood dream - the childhood dream of an orphan - to have a family of his own. </p> <p>He felt he had lived a mean life, but having entered the world with nothing, he had not been able to embrace alternative ways of being in the world. The next Sunday we quarrelled when he started abusing my mother's name because he was in a belligerent mood and needed someone to fight, and his wife was away for the day. When I left Jamaica that year, my father kissed me for the first time in my life. </p> <p>Though I longed to see the island again, I did not return for six years, in 1999. This visit followed a medical incident and my father's repeated request to see his grandchildren in London. My task was to ascertain whether he was fit enough to travel. By now, his wife had left him, and his niece, Pam, had moved in with her son. His health had deteriorated. He struggled to lift himself out of a chair, but insisted that he was still the same man. On my third night, we rushed him to hospital. \"A stroke in progress\" was diagnosed. </p> <p>He stayed in hospital for a weekend. When he came out, we often spoke in his bedroom, which he then shared with two lizards who had made their home above the wardrobe. Once, in a weary voice, he told me he was too tired to carry on. I reminded him that he had promised death a good fight. I now think he had given life too good a fight to keep that promise. </p> <p>The following Sunday, we drove to Portland, his home parish. It was a sad-happy visit. His half-sister welcomed us on her verandah, which faced tall yellow and red croton hedgerows, with fresh coconuts and home-made orange liqueur. The Caribbean sea whispered beyond palm trees. Further into Portland, up in the hills where he came from, we had soft drinks with Rosie Singh, whom my father described as his Indian girlfriend. Rosie, a sprightly octogenarian, had also lived in London for many years. </p> <p>But he could not visit the house in which he had grown up. It sits 200ft off the road, up steep concrete winding steps. Had he been able to make it, he would have seen his favourite cousin, Carmen; probably the only woman he ever really loved. I knew of the deep mutual affection between them, so it pained me to see my father standing at the bottom of the steps, longing to see Carmen. Perhaps also to see over the valley. But he was unable to climb because his heart was too weak. A dolorous air pervaded the car as we drove away from the house on the hillside. </p> <p>It was on that drive that I remembered our visit to the island in 1979 and the job I was offered. It seemed to me that I had betrayed my father by not choosing to stay on the island, by not choosing to come home, by losing sight of home. If I had, he would have had at least one of his sons near at hand in the fading light. He partly appeased my sense of betrayal when he said: \"A man can't own another man. A Jamaican more than anybody else in the world knows that.\" </p> <p>I left him in a good mood. We spoke on the phone over the rest of the year. I'd talked about a possible return trip in the autumn, but could not find the funds. In one telephone conversation, he reproached me for choosing such a poorly-paid profession and charged me with wasting my education. </p> <p>I said: \"But Dad, I've written several books.\" </p> <p>He said: \"Books! You can live in books?\" </p> <p>We laughed, and I said: \"I know what you mean, but it's my path.\" </p> <p>And, as he often did from when I was aged 14, he said: \"You must know what you're doing. But it sounds to me as if you have to try harder.\" It was our last proper telephone conversation. </p> <p>Throughout the burial fortnight I slept in my father's room. Some nights, the bed was strewn with mango petals and the night breeze brought in the raw odour of the newborn puppies. Some nights, my conscience troubled me. But after the funeral I felt at peace, because I knew that my father's flesh had blended with the beloved clay of his island.</p>",

The wet, ochre-coloured soil, rich in bauxite, stuck to the soles of my shoes. The mourners at the nearby graveside of another burial drowned out the singing from our own smaller gathering. The burial ended when the gravediggers had thrown on the last shovel-full of soil, and stuck in the earth a board bearing my father's name. Although a proper plaque would be added later, I could not help feeling that the burial was incomplete. Joscelyn Robert Dennis was born in the parish of Portland, a part of the island famous for its banana farms, near Port Antonio. His mother came from Moore Town, a village in the foothills of the Blue Mountain founded by Maroons, enslaved Africans who, in the 18th century, fled the plantations to the mountainous island interior, where they absorbed the few surviving aborigines, the Arawaks. She died when he was young, and he was brought up with the family of a grand-uncle, an albino, who taught him his trade, carpentry. My father's life was typical of many men from that island. Previous generations had worked on the Panama canals, picked oranges in Florida and cut sugar cane in Cuba, Costa Rica and Nicaragua, creating in those repeated exoduses a Jamaican diaspora. His carpentry skills took him from Portland to Kingston, where he lived in a series of tenement yards, and where he met my mother, herself a first-generation urban dweller. Like previous generations, their sights were set on working abroad. They first came to Britain in the late 50s, stayed for a few years, then returned to Kingston. Restless with ambition, however, he returned to London and we joined him some years later. Here, his life took an unusual turn. He became a house-owner and a landlord. Absorbed in work and managing a house of tenants - one of whom was his lover - he neglected his family. My mother did not hang around. Within three months, she had left, taking my sister with her, and leaving us to be brought up by my father. He now had sole responsibility for three young boys. Many families did not survive the 50s and early 60s crossing to Britain intact. In those cases, either the children went with the mother, or they were placed in local-authority homes. The latter option was often invoked as a threat by my father, to maintain discipline. But as he did not exercise it, it lost its effectiveness after a time. He had to rely on threats of, or actual, physical punishment. This was consistent with his worldview, which owed much to the Victorian values imbibed by Jamaicans in the post-emancipation years. My father had an incredible capacity for hard work. He often worked six days a week, and it was not uncommon not to see him in daylight during the winter. We lived in a late-Victorian, three-storey, terraced house in north Paddington. The tenants came from Jamaica, St Lucia and Dominica. The house was in need of constant maintenance, which he did himself in the evenings, weekends and on his holidays. Over the years, he damp-proofed it, repaired the roof and the windows, installed new gutters and two bathrooms, converted the ground floor into a self-contained flat, built a substantial garden shed, concreted over the front garden, and redecorated numerous rooms between tenancies. And he kept several lovers in the neighbourhood. We, his sons, called him Big D. While some white Britons constructed a comforting stereotype of the lazy, law-breaking, troublesome West Indian immigrant, my father pursued his ambitions quietly. Using a teach-yourself book, he taught himself to play the stock exchange, and monitored his modest shares portfolio through the Daily Telegraph, which he read religiously late at night while the rest of the house slept. He kept a bottle of rum for visiting friends - who tended to be fellow Jamaicans, usually from his part of the island - but never touched alcohol himself. The Victorian ethic of work and temperance were not the sole source of his beliefs. He was fond of black-and-white American movies, a legacy of his years in the Kingston tenement yards of the 40s and 50s, when the famous Crossroads cinema was the largest in the Caribbean. His favourite matinee idols were Edward G Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. The sort of gritty, no-nonsense manliness associated with some of the characters played by those actors was part of my father, too. Troublesome tenants, and neighbours for whom my father carried out house repairs but were slow to pay, saw this side of his character. So, too, did a young policeman. Shortly after buying a Rover car, he was stopped by this policeman in Harlesden and questioned about ownership of the vehicle. I was not present, but I imagined that he gave the policeman a piece of his mind, because my survival instinct counselled me to avoid him for a few days until his rage had subsided. Victorian work ethic and American gangster movies were, however, secondary to my father's passion for boxing. His speech was littered with boxing metaphors. For him, life came down to whether a man had \"heart\". A great boxing match was between men with great hearts. In his retirement years, he told me: \"I've given life a good fight and I'll give death a good fight, too.\" For a time, we, his sons, lived in fear of his violence and his vile tongue. But this side of his character was tempered by tremendous pride and love. How we presented ourselves to the world was, for him, a great source of honour. If he caught us wearing torn trousers, we were punished twice - first for the carelessness that caused the damage, and second for wearing the pants when out of the house. Apart from ensuring that we had adequate clothes for the seasons and school, every spring he took us to Burtons, where we were fitted out with tailor-made suits. As part of this tough love, he impressed on us the need for ambition and independence. He urged us to \"own the morning or risk being owned by the day\". Although he placed a high value on education, he was keen to see us out in the world as soon as possible. We were often reminded of his own upbringing in Jamaica, where he woke before dawn to feed the goats and fetch water. Staying in bed beyond seven, even on a Sunday morning, was for him a cardinal sin. He attached such importance to an early start that it was only in my early 40s that I could begin to enjoy the luxury of a Sunday-morning lie-in without hearing my father's exhortation to rise and face the day. The second born, I am generally considered to have been my father's favourite. I was not aware of this privilege during my childhood, but I now recognise that there is some truth to that claim. At some point in my teens, my father began to treat me differently. He confided in me, told me where to find important papers should anything happen to him. These included, I discovered at 16, shares in a South African mining company. He dismissed my protestation - the result of a nascent political and racial consciousness - with the remark: \"Don't talk foolishness. Where white people have black people working, there's profit. Nothing wrong with me, a black man, getting a share.\" I continued to protest, but without any success. We maintained a sparring dialogue up until his death. I once told him that I didn't want hands like his, huge and calloused. He laughed, and said proudly, \"These hands belong to a carpenter. I'll never be out of work. Never.\" How many times, with my soft hands, but skint, sitting in my studio overlooking Finsbury Park, have I seen my father hold up those carpenter's pincers and heard the arrogant, almost aristocratic pride in his voice. In 1979 I accompanied him on a trip back to Jamaica. By now, Jamaica had become, in my mind, a distant childhood memory, mere fragments. In our motherless household, there had been no contact with relatives, whose comings and goings might have nurtured a more powerful, less fragmented memory of the island. Instead, I had grown up as a black Briton, valuing my Caribbean roots but attaching little importance to a specific place. I had little sense of belonging to the island, or it belonging to me. While I had a thoroughly good time in the five weeks we were there, I saw and experienced little that made me want to extend my stay. Even a job offer at the university could not detain me. The island seemed so small, and wracked with violence and poverty. And I was surprised and disappointed to discover that it is 1,000 miles from the nearest English-speaking island. Moreover, I was young and determined to see something of the world, and Jamaica seemed an unlikely vantage point from which to satisfy that wanderlust. However, that visit was an exploration for my father. Over the next few years, he made several more visits, and on one occasion bought a house. In his 59th year, he left London, leaving behind his four children and grandchildren (11 at the time of his death). With my father now living in Jamaica, I resolved to acquaint myself better with the island. I also missed him. I had not seen much of him since leaving his house. But he had been a bus or train ride away, and I had visited him once a month, on Sunday afternoons. This was not an easy resolution to maintain. Nonetheless, I managed a few work-related visits in the 80s. The highlight of those brief visits was the Easter I spent there researching material for a BBC Radio 3 documentary on the poet Claude McKay. At dawn on Easter Sunday, I watched Rex Nettleford's Jamaica Dance Company in performance. Leaving the event and seeing the morning mist on the hill around Kingston marks the moment when my dormant love for the island was re-awakened. It has not slept since: on cold, wet London days it is as strident as a scorned lover. My father remarried during his final working years. He and his wife, Gennie, lived in an annexe to the house. He had built the annexe himself. The mainhouse, built in the post-independence growth spurt, is a pleasant bungalow with a helper's flat and a soothing view of hills. The extension spoilt the lines of the house, but created living quarters that were smaller in dimension to the main house, but contained as many rooms. In 1992, a year into his retirement, my father came back to Britain. His eyesight was poor from glaucoma, and he extended what was a originally planned as a holiday to secure an operation. While he waited, he travelled around London on his pensioner's travel card, seated at the top of the bus looking at whatever sights he could make out in the city. Although he was physically robust, his sight was a handicap. Nonetheless, he managed to fall out with my younger brother. My father always needed someone to fight. Slightly repaired, he returned to Jamaica. The following year I spent five months on the island - the longest period in my adult years. My father welcomed my presence, but - in case I had arrived there with any notions of staying with him beyond a few nights - reminded me of another of his rules: I had to make my way in the world without his help, and that included Kingston. I soon moved on, staying in hotel rooms, until a friend on the University of the West Indies's Mona Campus rented me her home while she went abroad. Ensconced in the cooler climate of Mona and absorbed in writing a novel, which later became The Last Blues Dance, I discovered a different island city. This Kingston of the early 90s was different from the Kingston of the late 70s. I was, of course, 14 years older, and perhaps more receptive to the city's finer charms. These included numerous art exhibitions, concerts, plays, contemporary dance performances. Rain that fell with an awesome majesty, a magical force, stirring pre-childhood memories. A plant that flowers once a year, and only at night, providing their owners with an excuse for a party, the climax of which is the moment of this annual floral spectacle. The Kingston of ganja-smoking rastas, lubricious dancehall queens and gun-toting yardies was all around, visibly and audibly loud. Jamaica's is a noisy culture. Even the most idyllic spot is often marred by what my friend Carolyn Cooper, a lecturer at the University of the West Indies, calls \"musical terrorism\". One of the means by which the island's poor remind the rich of their ineradicable presence. And the source of a sound - reggae - that, from the 70s to the mid-80s, captured the world's music lovers and bequeathed us an icon in Bob Marley. Rich and poor take pride in the island. Its internationally renowned sons and daughters keep hope alive. Its athletes compete at the highest level in numerous sports. And the many children of its diaspora - General Colin Powell, Linford Christie and Diane Abbott - show what is possible with the Jamaican spirit beyond the island. Yet Jamaica is a conservative island. Authority matters here. Jamaicans are quick to take umbrage, swift to react to any signs of disrespect. There is a vaguely Victorian formality about their manners - underlaid, I suspect, by an African love of tradition. Jamaica, unlike Trinidad, has never had a coup, nor are its politics as riven with ethnic divisions, like Guyana. With more than 75% of the population comprising people of African descent, ethnicity does not have the same divisive powers as elsewhere. And Christian churches, particularly the Baptist, have an extensive and tenacious grip over the people. My father's marriage had become acrimonious. His wife bitterly complained to me about his manners, his general roughness, his cutting tongue. She did not know how to spar with him. I expressed sympathy, but left her in no doubt where my loyalty laid. I tried to mediate, but my father rebuffed me. He explained that she had caused the rift because, while he was in London, she had lodged the rental income in her bank account. I suggested that he should have given her an allowance. He replied: \"Her problem is, she not happy with the milk from the cow. She wan' nyam [eat] the cow.\" We talked a lot about London. My father expressed pride in his achievements there: the houses he had owned; the buildings he had worked on - among them the Barbican and the South Bank; three sons who went on to higher education; the admiration of those he met, such as his doctor, who had asked him to share his child-rearing secret because his own teenage son had dropped out. But he had a few regrets. On a still Sunday night, as we sat on the verandah with the dogs in the neighbourhood barking and the music of an open-air evangelical meeting coming from the distance, he told me that his greatest regret was his failure to keep his family together. It had been a childhood dream - the childhood dream of an orphan - to have a family of his own. He felt he had lived a mean life, but having entered the world with nothing, he had not been able to embrace alternative ways of being in the world. The next Sunday we quarrelled when he started abusing my mother's name because he was in a belligerent mood and needed someone to fight, and his wife was away for the day. When I left Jamaica that year, my father kissed me for the first time in my life. Though I longed to see the island again, I did not return for six years, in 1999. This visit followed a medical incident and my father's repeated request to see his grandchildren in London. My task was to ascertain whether he was fit enough to travel. By now, his wife had left him, and his niece, Pam, had moved in with her son. His health had deteriorated. He struggled to lift himself out of a chair, but insisted that he was still the same man. On my third night, we rushed him to hospital. \"A stroke in progress\" was diagnosed. He stayed in hospital for a weekend. When he came out, we often spoke in his bedroom, which he then shared with two lizards who had made their home above the wardrobe. Once, in a weary voice, he told me he was too tired to carry on. I reminded him that he had promised death a good fight. I now think he had given life too good a fight to keep that promise. The following Sunday, we drove to Portland, his home parish. It was a sad-happy visit. His half-sister welcomed us on her verandah, which faced tall yellow and red croton hedgerows, with fresh coconuts and home-made orange liqueur. The Caribbean sea whispered beyond palm trees. Further into Portland, up in the hills where he came from, we had soft drinks with Rosie Singh, whom my father described as his Indian girlfriend. Rosie, a sprightly octogenarian, had also lived in London for many years. But he could not visit the house in which he had grown up. It sits 200ft off the road, up steep concrete winding steps. Had he been able to make it, he would have seen his favourite cousin, Carmen; probably the only woman he ever really loved. I knew of the deep mutual affection between them, so it pained me to see my father standing at the bottom of the steps, longing to see Carmen. Perhaps also to see over the valley. But he was unable to climb because his heart was too weak. A dolorous air pervaded the car as we drove away from the house on the hillside. It was on that drive that I remembered our visit to the island in 1979 and the job I was offered. It seemed to me that I had betrayed my father by not choosing to stay on the island, by not choosing to come home, by losing sight of home. If I had, he would have had at least one of his sons near at hand in the fading light. He partly appeased my sense of betrayal when he said: \"A man can't own another man. A Jamaican more than anybody else in the world knows that.\" I left him in a good mood. We spoke on the phone over the rest of the year. I'd talked about a possible return trip in the autumn, but could not find the funds. In one telephone conversation, he reproached me for choosing such a poorly-paid profession and charged me with wasting my education. I said: \"But Dad, I've written several books.\" He said: \"Books! You can live in books?\" We laughed, and I said: \"I know what you mean, but it's my path.\" And, as he often did from when I was aged 14, he said: \"You must know what you're doing. But it sounds to me as if you have to try harder.\" It was our last proper telephone conversation. Throughout the burial fortnight I slept in my father's room. Some nights, the bed was strewn with mango petals and the night breeze brought in the raw odour of the newborn puppies. Some nights, my conscience troubled me. But after the funeral I felt at peace, because I knew that my father's flesh had blended with the beloved clay of his island.",

      "body": "<p>In 1971 Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado travelled to Rwanda as an economist working for the International Coffee Organisation. His job was to assess the efficiency of plantations and to advise on diversification of crops at a time of over-production. It seems an unlikely episode to feature in the history of photo-journalism, but the 27-year-old Salgado, who had never even taken a snap until 1970, took his wife's camera on the trip. While there he photographed everything he saw and, on returning to his home in London, discovered that, \"the pictures gave me 10 times as much pleasure as did my economic report. Photography was a better way to get inside reality.\" </p> <p>Salgado has gone on to produce some of the most iconic and overwhelming images of the last three decades. He has also redefined the business model of photo-journalism, working through his own agency, which allows him not only editorial control of what he shoots, but also the power to harness his work in the service of the humanitarian and environmental issues that consume him. \"You must have a reason to be somewhere in the world taking photographs,\" he explains. \"You have to believe your pictures will be of some use. Otherwise there is no point.\" Paradoxically, his most widely seen pictures are not in the least representative of his work or philosophy. In 1981 he took the only stills of the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan. But while these dramatic images appeared on the front pages of every newspaper in the world, the pictures that he will best be remembered for come from months of intense absorption in his subject, not from a few seconds of being in the right place at the right time. And his subject's are not the rich and powerful but the poor and the powerless. </p> <p>It was Salgado who captured the \"human anthill\" gold mine at Serra Pelada in Brazil. In a vast open pit, the size of two football pitches, 50,000 mud covered \"garimpeiros\" - freelance gold prospectors - carried their cargoes of debris up and down flimsy ladders in a scene that has been described as straight from Hieronymus Bosch's vision of hell. Salgado's early pictures of the Ethiopian famine in 1984/85 alerted the world to the impending catastrophe. It is not too strong a claim to make that his work started the process that culminated with LiveAid. His pictures of oil-blackened workers capping wells in Kuwait in the aftermath of the Gulf War crystallised both what the war was about and what it had cost. </p> <p>Salgado's work is shown in galleries and printed in handsomely produced expensive books. He has won every major photographic award and regularly delivers high-profile lectures. Photo-journalism at this level continues to raise many problematic moral and aesthetic issues, and Salgado's unprecedented commercial success has made him something of a lightning rod for criticism. Is it right that such misery should appear on swanky gallery walls? Is the only person who gains from these pictures the photographer himself? What place do $100 photographic books have in a debate about poverty? </p> <p>\"Of course there are huge moral dilemmas about publishing a very expensive book which has pictures of people dying in it,\" says pioneering British photo-journalist Don McCullin who came to prominence with his work on the Vietnam war. \"And the argument that the person who gains the most from this sort of work is the photographer does hold some water. These have always been difficult issues for photo-journalism and they can be applied to all of us. But in a time when editors don't want death and destruction in their papers anymore, when all they are after is the up-beat, it has been Salgado who has managed to keep making people sit up and take notice.\"</p> <p>The writer John Berger is currently working on a film about Salgado with the American actor and director Tim Robbins. \"People were saying photo-journalism was over but he proves it is not,\" says Berger. \"We have become so accustomed to seeing people who are suffering only as victims. There is a syndrome around catastrophe and victimisation, fed by the media, that promotes only a sense of pity. But what he tries to do is allow the dignity of people, even people who are suffering terribly, to become evident in his photographs.\" </p> <p>Since his pictures of the African famines appeared, Salgado has been engaged on a series of increasingly monumental projects examining the lives of vast swathes of the world's population. These projects take him to his locations for weeks and even months. The results have been remarkable. Workers, his study of manual labour at the end of the 20th century, was published in 1993 and involved six years work and 26 countries. His latest major work on population movement, Migrations, was published last month and took five years to complete. This time he travelled to 35 countries and documented the magnetic draw of North America on the south, the refugee crises in Africa, the rural exodus in Latin America and the explosion of megacities in Asia. </p> <p>\"What drives him? Justice, I think,\" says Chris Boot who worked with Salgado at the Magnum photographic agency. \"It sounds old-fashioned but he has an extremely strong sense of, and direct involvement in, issues of social justice.\" </p> <p>Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado was born in 1944 on a ranch near the small town of Aimor\u00e9s in the Brazilian hinterland. His extended family of 16, including seven sisters, was female except for him and his father, and he acknowledges that he was cosseted. Half of their land was cultivated, with the other half taken up by rainforest. </p> <p>\"It was fabulous playing in the forest,\" he recalls. \"There were lots of rivers and we would see monkeys and crocodiles. The forest was part of our life.\"</p> <p> His family raised cattle as well as growing beans and rice and were broadly self-sufficient. Salgado is a fierce critic of the processes of globalisation and fondly compares his model of farming to the trend for vast agri-businesses that swept Brazil as he grew up. When he was about eight the rainforest on his own ranch, with others in the region, was entirely turned over to cattle as the Brazilian economy swung behind the need to export meat to global markets in general and to north America in particular. </p> <p>\"Everybody did it but it was a disaster,\" he says. \"When the rains came the land became badly eroded, soon it was almost like a desert.\" </p> <p>He attended the local school until he was 15 and then went to the port town of Vit\u00f3ria where he took a series of part-time jobs to pay for his continuing education. He worked in a Ford garage parking cars and in a bookshop. It was while employed as a secretary in a French language school that he met his wife to be, L\u00e9lia, who now runs their photographic agency. </p> <p>He graduated from Espirito Santo College in Vit\u00f3ria in 1967 and married L\u00e9lia the same year. They moved to S\u00e3o Paulo where he did post-graduate work and went on to a job in the state finance ministry as an economist. He soon became involved with the leftist movement. After a coup in 1968 the military regime in Brazil became increasingly repressive. Salgado soon found himself facing a difficult choice. Friends and comrades were being tortured and some were even killed. \"I could become a clandestine leftist, or become a guerrilla or leave Brazil,\" he explains. </p> <p>He chose to leave. \"We thought about it for a few months but we were young and decided it was for the best.\" In 1969 he and L\u00e9lia arrived in Paris where he continued work on a PhD and she studied as an architect. \"We were part-refugees, part-immigrants, part-students,\" he says. After his discovery of photography in Rwanda he began to go to photographic shows in London and buy books on the subject. Two years later he resigned from his job and went back to France to work as a freelance photographer. He bought a motorbike and started \"running round Paris\" taking photos. He soon joined the Sigma agency, the black leather-jacketed hard-men of French photography. </p> <p>Six months later his son, Juliano, was born and Salgado resigned from Sigma because he didn't want to travel full-time. Juliano is now 26 and makes documentaries. Salgado has one grandson. His second son, Rodrigo, was born five years later and has Downs' Syndrome. Rodrigo lives with his parents in Paris but his father is proud of his independence - he takes the bus to school on his own, speaks French and Portuguese and plays piano and the guitar. Salgado says, \"I'm editing my personal contact sheets at the moment and looking at the pictures it breaks my heart to see how many years I missed. I have seen all over the planet but I have lost a big part of my life. L\u00e9lia has brought then up and she has been marvellous.\" John Easterby, who was director of archiving at Magnum while Salgado was there and is now director of the prestigious IPG agency, remembers Salgado taking two \"monster\" commercial ad campaign jobs for le Creuset and Volvo. \"The work was completely consistent with his style but he was very open that the money he would make would enable him to provide a better life for his son. The paradox is that the set of pictures that made him the most money, the Reagan shooting, were the worst pictures he has ever done.\" </p> <p>In 1975, Salgado joined the Gamma agency and worked with them for the next four years. \"This was my school of photo-journalism,\" he says. \"Gamma worked for all the big papers all over the world.\" His list of photographic heroes at that time is instructive. It is perhaps no surprise that he says, \"Don McCullin for me was God.\" He also praises the work of Philip Jones Griffiths who, like McCullin, worked in Vietnam during that war. But the photographer whom he says influenced him most was Bill Brandt who, although acclaimed for photographing conditions in London during the blitz, is equally well known for his nudes and almost surreal depictions of pure form. </p> <p>McCullin warns that, \"with photo-journalism you have to be careful not to stray into that dodgy grey area of art. But Salgado is passionate about what he believes in, and you have to acknowledge his major achievements. He has made photo-journalism respectable.\" </p> <p>Salgado says that being at Gamma was exhilarating. \"We would read the press wires for news anywhere on the planet. We'd get somewhere on a Friday night, meet the local press, shoot the pictures and on the Monday you'd ask someone at the airport to take your films back to Paris. Gamma would send a motorcyclist to the airport and two days later your pictures would be in Newsweek and Time. It was fantastic.\" </p> <p>This was a period of \"massive stories\" for photo-journalists with the on-going de-colonisation of Africa being accompanied by war and famine. But after four years he became increasingly disillusioned. \"I began to repeat things, and we would only have two days to deal with these big issues. It became a big frustration to me and I began to explore whether I could work in another way.\" </p> <p>In 1979 he went to South America with a view to putting together a substantial body of work on the peasant population. Several charities have used his work to raise funds and awareness of third world poverty, and Christian Aid supported this trip by commissioning work. Joseph Cabon is its head of photography. \"His images can convey to viewers who may not know anything about the situation a sense of what those people are going through,\" says Cabon. \"What he has done is make a lot of difficult subjects easier to deal with for people who otherwise might have been turned off. It fits with the way Christian Aid wants to present issues that are important to us.\" </p> <p>Salgado spent four months in Bolivia, Peru and Equador. The pictures he took eventually contributed to his 1986 book Other Americas, but at the time he couldn't sell a single picture to a commercial buyer. His response was to leave the exclusively \"hot-news\" Gamma and move to the unruly cooperative that was the Magnum photo-agency, the home of \"concerned photography\", where he hoped to pursue his ideas of more substantial work. </p> <p>Magnum had been set up in 1947 by Cartier-Bresson, \"the poet of the camera\", and the war photographers Robert Capa, David Seymour and George Rodger. Capa and Seymour both died covering wars and Rodger abandoned war photography after finding himself looking for composition when photographing Belsen. Salgado was given more room to develop his preferred style of working but, ironically, he was working for Magnum when he took the Reagan shots. </p> <p>He was on a story covering the president's first 100 days in office. Reagan was speaking at a hotel in Washington. Because Salgado had eight pages to fill and needed lots of different shots he left the hotel just before the speech finished to capture Reagan leaving the building - 200 other photographers stayed inside the hall and got pictures of him smiling and shaking hands. \"I started to take pictures just as the man [John Hinckley] started shooting,\" says Salgado. \"Because I was on this story for the New York Times I had been driven to the hotel with security men, so they knew who I was, and I was actually standing inside the security ring when it happened.\" But he doesn't like showing the pictures or talking about them too much. \"It gets so much attention that I could become just the photographer who took the pictures of the assassination attempt on President Reagan. That can destroy you for just one minute's work.\" He began to develop a mode of working that would satisfy both his clients and himself. He made 16 additional trips to Latin America to finish off his Other Americas project and he got magazines to pay for them all. \"I would do a week for a magazine project in Bolivia and then three weeks for me,\" he explains. He has continued with this patchwork of funding and support ever since. \"It allows me to use my ideas and not just the ideas of the magazines.\" </p> <p>While the high-spending glossy magazines pick up most of the bills for his trips he has maintained and developed links with aid agencies and other humanitarian organisations, such as Save the Children. Alan Thomas, the charity's picture librarian, says, \"If Salgado thinks that our work will fit into what he is doing anyway then he will work for our measly rates and he will do what we ask him to do. His style of getting in very close with children and showing dynamic images links with a lot of our activities.\" </p> <p>Salgado relies on the support of agencies while on the road but usually travels alone, taking only three small cameras and three lenses. For all this apparent simplicity, his style of working is not universally popular. One aid worker who accompanied him in Africa described him as, \"a complete prima donna. He is used to people paying homage to him and he doesn't muck in regarding accommodation. Having said that, in the end I forgave him everything because, of course, the pictures were brilliant.\" </p> <p>She says he had a wonderful knack of dealing with children in particular. \"The children weren't frightened. He sort of mesmerised them and they would freeze for him.\" A fellow photo-journalist is less impressed. \"His work in the early 80s was extremely technically competent and remarkable in many ways. But since he has been doing these huge projects there doesn't seem to be any soul to his work. It feels automated. I was with him in what was Zaire and he didn't seem to have a great deal of interest in the people he photographed.\" </p> <p>John Easterby defends him. \"While of course it would be nice to make the down times in the evening as pleasant as possible, that is not why he is there. He has a job to do. This man's work, indirectly, inspired the public response to the Ethiopian famine.\" </p> <p> There is little doubt that Salgado, like most photo-journalists, is not without ego, ambition or determination. It is part of the job description and he had to call on all his powers of self belief when he embarked on his study to record the end of large scale manual labour. \"For me we were arriving at the end of industrial revolution, with the arrival of intelligent machines,\" he says. \"The relation between men and machine had changed for ever.\" The six-year study took in a slaughterhouse in South Dakota, textile factories in Bangladesh, steelworks in the Ukraine and workers digging the Eurotunnel in Folkestone. He found that while European factories had already been automated, the old manual versions had been shipped, almost piece by piece to the third world. </p> <p>He readily acknowledges that he does more than simply record his subjects. He explicitly sets out to show their dignity. \"My pictures are not neutral. Photography is not objective There is no such thing as a neutral picture. When you take a photograph of something you come with your past, with the way you think. You photograph with your mind and, of course, as an economist I knew this world very well by theory. I wanted to record the end of an era.\" </p> <p>The length of time he spends making his pictures is important. Any documentary photographer will tell you of the problems of people either being camera shy or playing up to the camera. \"When you are there for four weeks or four months then the relationship is completely different,\" he says. \"You have time to wait for real things to happen in front of you.\" </p> <p> One of the artistic criticisms made of him is that his later work, can sometimes give the feeling that he is on autopilot, simply harvesting images. Critics have spoken of a sense of sterility and coldness. John Easterby says it is true that he has, \"developed a fingerprint for his pictures. That's what artists try to do. He did that early and to great effect and has to some extent stuck to it. But you have to remember that many magazines now have a paranoia about upsetting the sensibilities of their readers.\" Easterby contends that Salgado has thought this through and developed a way to show horrific situations without making readers look away. \"Many pictures from famine or from war border on the pornographic. But if people look at a picture and close their eyes or turn the page you have served no purpose at all. His pictures are beautiful manifestations of the unpalatable. He makes it possible to look at the unlookable.\" John Berger rejects the often-made accompanying criticism that because Salgado's work can be beautiful while depicting shocking events it is somehow hypocritical or exploitative. \"For Christ's sake,\" he explodes, \"I mean literally for Christ's sake. I've seldom heard a more half-baked argument. What about all the crucifixions in western art? What about the Piet\u00e1 of Michaelangelo? Half of European visual art until the 20th century was about terrible things that at the same time were beautiful. In fact they were the definition of what people called beautiful.\" </p> <p>Not even Salgado's sternest critics have described his set of pictures of the Serra Pelada as anything but awesome. Salgado says he had tried to get to the mine for several years but, because it was under the jurisdiction of the federal police and he had a political past in Brazil, he was always refused access. It wasn't until 1986, when the police had ceded control of the mine to the cooperative that owned it, that he was allowed in. \"It was a vision from the middle ages,\" he says. \"There were no machines and all these men were working in a very primitive way.\" He stayed for three weeks and remembers the place as having a unique ambience. \"There were no women allowed and there was this atmosphere that combined the danger of the work and the chance of huge wealth. People would work for months in the hope of getting some gold because you could get up to 2 kilos if you were lucky. Many of them never got any gold at all, but a lot of them did and went on to buy hotels or small farms.\" </p> <p>His project on workers naturally segued into an interest in migration. Everywhere he travelled he came across people on the move. \"From just a few million eight years ago there are now 30m or 40m refugees today. And this is just people who have crossed borders, there are more again who are refugees within their own country.\" </p> <p>In 1994, soon after starting the project, he left Magnum and set up his own Amazonas agency, which is run by his wife. Chris Boot explains the complex dynamics of the Magnum co-operative. \"They could be a very disputatious group. There is always a clash in the organisation between the independence of the individual and collective endeavour. Most photographers clash with the group at some stage. One of the problems is that people have almost family-like relationships and so a departure is somewhat akin to divorce.\" </p> <p>Working through his own contacts, Salgado planned the complex logistics of his migrants project. Arrangements were made to provide 12 magazines with excerpts from the work in progress, and the completed study now takes the form of two large books, a travelling show, a set of posters and a series of information packs for teachers to lead discussions in schools. The pictures themselves are an astonishing testament to perhaps the most significant global event of our times. </p> <p>\"This is a serious problem and it needs to be discussed,\" he says. \"I am accused of photographing misery but that is not true. I have photographed people who have lost their base, their way of life. But these people have dignity and are hoping to go to a new life. They all have a story. They are not statistics.\" He is adamant that the pictures are not about merely pricking consciences. \"I want to tell people what is going on and how easily things can change. For instance, in the former Yugoslavia, people had lives very similar to life in Britain. They were not poor. They had cars and television and universities. Now they are in a very difficult situation. It can happen so fast and it can happen to anyone. </p> <p>Germans today are so rich, but 50 years ago they were at the side of the road as refugees. And that change can happen in Africa as well. It is terrible what is going on in Africa today and it is getting worse.\" </p> <p>He admits that changes in the media mean it is unlikely he could ever undertake another project in this scale. Magazines which have traditionally taken his work are becoming more and more reticent about photo-journalism. But Salgado will continue to take photographs and pursue other practical action to further the causes he believes in. </p> <p>Back in Brazil, on the ranch where he grew up, he is currently attempting to re-plant the forest that was destroyed when he was a boy. He has plans to plant 1.5m trees and build an educational establishment that will teach both children and teachers about environmental issues in their area. He has committed a considerable amount of money himself and in total has raised $1m of the $3.5m needed. Last autumn the first 82,000 trees were planted. \"It won't change the weather,\" he says, \"but it might change the mentality of people. That is the most important thing.\" </p> <p>\"Salgado's work is an onslaught on public opinion,\" says John Berger. \"His phrase is 'let us listen to the present'. Some photographers say 'no'. They record the shock or horror felt by the witnesses to terrible events but there is no sense of human effort and therefore no sense of human resistance. Salgado sees these are real people. The realisation of this dignity, even in their bereavement or mourning, is to say 'yes'. Salgado says 'yes'.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong><br> February 8 1944, Aimor\u00e9s, Brazil. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong><br> 1967 L\u00e9lia Wanick (two sons Juliano and Rodrigo). </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong><br> S\u00e3o Paulo University; Ecole Nationale de Statistique et de l'Administration Economique, Paris. </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> <br>Economist, Ministry of Finance, S\u00e3o Paulo 1968-69; economist, International Coffee Organisation, London 1971-73.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Photography: </strong><br> 1975-79 Gamma agency; 1979-94 Magnum agency; 1994-present Amazonas Images.<strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Touring exhibitions:</strong><br> 1986-97 Sahel: Man In Distress; 1989-96 Ret rospective; 1990-99 An Uncertain Grace; 1992-99 Workers; 1994-98 Serra Pelada; 2000 Migrations. </p> <p><strong> Books: </strong> <br>1986 Sahel: Man In Distress; Other Americas; 1990 An Uncertain Grace; 1993 Workers; 1997 Terra; 2000 Migrations. </p> <p><strong> Honours: </strong><br> 1999<strong> </strong> Alfred Eisenstaedt award for magazine photography. </p> <p>\u0095 Migrations: Humanity in Transition (\u00a360), and The Children: Refugees and Migrants (\u00a325), are published by Aperture, New York.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1971 Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado travelled to Rwanda as an economist working for the International Coffee Organisation. His job was to assess the efficiency of plantations and to advise on diversification of crops at a time of over-production. It seems an unlikely episode to feature in the history of photo-journalism, but the 27-year-old Salgado, who had never even taken a snap until 1970, took his wife's camera on the trip. While there he photographed everything he saw and, on returning to his home in London, discovered that, \"the pictures gave me 10 times as much pleasure as did my economic report. Photography was a better way to get inside reality.\" Salgado has gone on to produce some of the most iconic and overwhelming images of the last three decades. He has also redefined the business model of photo-journalism, working through his own agency, which allows him not only editorial control of what he shoots, but also the power to harness his work in the service of the humanitarian and environmental issues that consume him. \"You must have a reason to be somewhere in the world taking photographs,\" he explains. \"You have to believe your pictures will be of some use. Otherwise there is no point.\" Paradoxically, his most widely seen pictures are not in the least representative of his work or philosophy. In 1981 he took the only stills of the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan. But while these dramatic images appeared on the front pages of every newspaper in the world, the pictures that he will best be remembered for come from months of intense absorption in his subject, not from a few seconds of being in the right place at the right time. And his subject's are not the rich and powerful but the poor and the powerless. It was Salgado who captured the \"human anthill\" gold mine at Serra Pelada in Brazil. In a vast open pit, the size of two football pitches, 50,000 mud covered \"garimpeiros\" - freelance gold prospectors - carried their cargoes of debris up and down flimsy ladders in a scene that has been described as straight from Hieronymus Bosch's vision of hell. Salgado's early pictures of the Ethiopian famine in 1984/85 alerted the world to the impending catastrophe. It is not too strong a claim to make that his work started the process that culminated with LiveAid. His pictures of oil-blackened workers capping wells in Kuwait in the aftermath of the Gulf War crystallised both what the war was about and what it had cost. Salgado's work is shown in galleries and printed in handsomely produced expensive books. He has won every major photographic award and regularly delivers high-profile lectures. Photo-journalism at this level continues to raise many problematic moral and aesthetic issues, and Salgado's unprecedented commercial success has made him something of a lightning rod for criticism. Is it right that such misery should appear on swanky gallery walls? Is the only person who gains from these pictures the photographer himself? What place do $100 photographic books have in a debate about poverty? \"Of course there are huge moral dilemmas about publishing a very expensive book which has pictures of people dying in it,\" says pioneering British photo-journalist Don McCullin who came to prominence with his work on the Vietnam war. \"And the argument that the person who gains the most from this sort of work is the photographer does hold some water.

His latest major work on population movement, Migrations, was published last month and took five years to complete. This time he travelled to 35 countries and documented the magnetic draw of North America on the south, the refugee crises in Africa, the rural exodus in Latin America and the explosion of megacities in Asia. \"What drives him? Justice, I think,\" says Chris Boot who worked with Salgado at the Magnum photographic agency. \"It sounds old-fashioned but he has an extremely strong sense of, and direct involvement in, issues of social justice.\" Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado was born in 1944 on a ranch near the small town of Aimor\u00e9s in the Brazilian hinterland.

It fits with the way Christian Aid wants to present issues that are important to us.\" Salgado spent four months in Bolivia, Peru and Equador. The pictures he took eventually contributed to his 1986 book Other Americas, but at the time he couldn't sell a single picture to a commercial buyer. His response was to leave the exclusively \"hot-news\" Gamma and move to the unruly cooperative that was the Magnum photo-agency, the home of \"concerned photography\", where he hoped to pursue his ideas of more substantial work. Magnum had been set up in 1947 by Cartier-Bresson, \"the poet of the camera\", and the war photographers Robert Capa, David Seymour and George Rodger. Capa and Seymour both died covering wars and Rodger abandoned war photography after finding himself looking for composition when photographing Belsen. Salgado was given more room to develop his preferred style of working but, ironically, he was working for Magnum when he took the Reagan shots. He was on a story covering the president's first 100 days in office. Reagan was speaking at a hotel in Washington. Because Salgado had eight pages to fill and needed lots of different shots he left the hotel just before the speech finished to capture Reagan leaving the building - 200 other photographers stayed inside the hall and got pictures of him smiling and shaking hands. \"I started to take pictures just as the man [John Hinckley] started shooting,\" says Salgado. \"Because I was on this story for the New York Times I had been driven to the hotel with security men, so they knew who I was, and I was actually standing inside the security ring when it happened.\" But he doesn't like showing the pictures or talking about them too much. \"It gets so much attention that I could become just the photographer who took the pictures of the assassination attempt on President Reagan. That can destroy you for just one minute's work.\" He began to develop a mode of working that would satisfy both his clients and himself. He made 16 additional trips to Latin America to finish off his Other Americas project and he got magazines to pay for them all. \"I would do a week for a magazine project in Bolivia and then three weeks for me,\" he explains. He has continued with this patchwork of funding and support ever since. \"It allows me to use my ideas and not just the ideas of the magazines.\" While the high-spending glossy magazines pick up most of the bills for his trips he has maintained and developed links with aid agencies and other humanitarian organisations, such as Save the Children. Alan Thomas, the charity's picture librarian, says, \"If Salgado thinks that our work will fit into what he is doing anyway then he will work for our measly rates and he will do what we ask him to do. His style of getting in very close with children and showing dynamic images links with a lot of our activities.\" Salgado relies on the support of agencies while on the road but usually travels alone, taking only three small cameras and three lenses. For all this apparent simplicity, his style of working is not universally popular. One aid worker who accompanied him in Africa described him as, \"a complete prima donna. He is used to people paying homage to him and he doesn't muck in regarding accommodation. Having said that, in the end I forgave him everything because, of course, the pictures were brilliant.\" She says he had a wonderful knack of dealing with children in particular. \"The children weren't frightened. He sort of mesmerised them and they would freeze for him.\" A fellow photo-journalist is less impressed. \"His work in the early 80s was extremely technically competent and remarkable in many ways. But since he has been doing these huge projects there doesn't seem to be any soul to his work. It feels automated. I was with him in what was Zaire and he didn't seem to have a great deal of interest in the people he photographed.\" John Easterby defends him. \"While of course it would be nice to make the down times in the evening as pleasant as possible, that is not why he is there. He has a job to do. This man's work, indirectly, inspired the public response to the Ethiopian famine.\" There is little doubt that Salgado, like most photo-journalists, is not without ego, ambition or determination. It is part of the job description and he had to call on all his powers of self belief when he embarked on his study to record the end of large scale manual labour. \"For me we were arriving at the end of industrial revolution, with the arrival of intelligent machines,\" he says. \"The relation between men and machine had changed for ever.\" The six-year study took in a slaughterhouse in South Dakota, textile factories in Bangladesh, steelworks in the Ukraine and workers digging the Eurotunnel in Folkestone. He found that while European factories had already been automated, the old manual versions had been shipped, almost piece by piece to the third world. He readily acknowledges that he does more than simply record his subjects. He explicitly sets out to show their dignity. \"My pictures are not neutral. Photography is not objective There is no such thing as a neutral picture. When you take a photograph of something you come with your past, with the way you think. You photograph with your mind and, of course, as an economist I knew this world very well by theory. I wanted to record the end of an era.\" The length of time he spends making his pictures is important. Any documentary photographer will tell you of the problems of people either being camera shy or playing up to the camera. \"When you are there for four weeks or four months then the relationship is completely different,\" he says. \"You have time to wait for real things to happen in front of you.\" One of the artistic criticisms made of him is that his later work, can sometimes give the feeling that he is on autopilot, simply harvesting images. Critics have spoken of a sense of sterility and coldness. John Easterby says it is true that he has, \"developed a fingerprint for his pictures. That's what artists try to do. He did that early and to great effect and has to some extent stuck to it. But you have to remember that many magazines now have a paranoia about upsetting the sensibilities of their readers.\" Easterby contends that Salgado has thought this through and developed a way to show horrific situations without making readers look away. \"Many pictures from famine or from war border on the pornographic. But if people look at a picture and close their eyes or turn the page you have served no purpose at all. His pictures are beautiful manifestations of the unpalatable. He makes it possible to look at the unlookable.\" John Berger rejects the often-made accompanying criticism that because Salgado's work can be beautiful while depicting shocking events it is somehow hypocritical or exploitative. \"For Christ's sake,\" he explodes, \"I mean literally for Christ's sake. I've seldom heard a more half-baked argument. What about all the crucifixions in western art? What about the Piet\u00e1 of Michaelangelo? Half of European visual art until the 20th century was about terrible things that at the same time were beautiful. In fact they were the definition of what people called beautiful.\" Not even Salgado's sternest critics have described his set of pictures of the Serra Pelada as anything but awesome. Salgado says he had tried to get to the mine for several years but, because it was under the jurisdiction of the federal police and he had a political past in Brazil, he was always refused access. It wasn't until 1986, when the police had ceded control of the mine to the cooperative that owned it, that he was allowed in. \"It was a vision from the middle ages,\" he says. \"There were no machines and all these men were working in a very primitive way.\" He stayed for three weeks and remembers the place as having a unique ambience. \"There were no women allowed and there was this atmosphere that combined the danger of the work and the chance of huge wealth. People would work for months in the hope of getting some gold because you could get up to 2 kilos if you were lucky. Many of them never got any gold at all, but a lot of them did and went on to buy hotels or small farms.\" His project on workers naturally segued into an interest in migration. Everywhere he travelled he came across people on the move. \"From just a few million eight years ago there are now 30m or 40m refugees today. And this is just people who have crossed borders, there are more again who are refugees within their own country.\" In 1994, soon after starting the project, he left Magnum and set up his own Amazonas agency, which is run by his wife. Chris Boot explains the complex dynamics of the Magnum co-operative. \"They could be a very disputatious group. There is always a clash in the organisation between the independence of the individual and collective endeavour. Most photographers clash with the group at some stage. One of the problems is that people have almost family-like relationships and so a departure is somewhat akin to divorce.\" Working through his own contacts, Salgado planned the complex logistics of his migrants project. Arrangements were made to provide 12 magazines with excerpts from the work in progress, and the completed study now takes the form of two large books, a travelling show, a set of posters and a series of information packs for teachers to lead discussions in schools. The pictures themselves are an astonishing testament to perhaps the most significant global event of our times. \"This is a serious problem and it needs to be discussed,\" he says. \"I am accused of photographing misery but that is not true. I have photographed people who have lost their base, their way of life. But these people have dignity and are hoping to go to a new life. They all have a story. They are not statistics.\" He is adamant that the pictures are not about merely pricking consciences. \"I want to tell people what is going on and how easily things can change. For instance, in the former Yugoslavia, people had lives very similar to life in Britain. They were not poor. They had cars and television and universities. Now they are in a very difficult situation. It can happen so fast and it can happen to anyone. Germans today are so rich, but 50 years ago they were at the side of the road as refugees. And that change can happen in Africa as well. It is terrible what is going on in Africa today and it is getting worse.\" He admits that changes in the media mean it is unlikely he could ever undertake another project in this scale. Magazines which have traditionally taken his work are becoming more and more reticent about photo-journalism. But Salgado will continue to take photographs and pursue other practical action to further the causes he believes in. Back in Brazil, on the ranch where he grew up, he is currently attempting to re-plant the forest that was destroyed when he was a boy. He has plans to plant 1.5m trees and build an educational establishment that will teach both children and teachers about environmental issues in their area. He has committed a considerable amount of money himself and in total has raised $1m of the $3.5m needed. Last autumn the first 82,000 trees were planted. \"It won't change the weather,\" he says, \"but it might change the mentality of people. That is the most important thing.\" \"Salgado's work is an onslaught on public opinion,\" says John Berger. \"His phrase is 'let us listen to the present'. Some photographers say 'no'. They record the shock or horror felt by the witnesses to terrible events but there is no sense of human effort and therefore no sense of human resistance. Salgado sees these are real people. The realisation of this dignity, even in their bereavement or mourning, is to say 'yes'. Salgado says 'yes'.\" Life at a glance Born: February 8 1944, Aimor\u00e9s, Brazil.

To be sure, other areas may lay claim to being undisputed champions: \"If you go to Wisbech in East Anglia, they'll say that the best strawberries are grown in Wisbech,\" says Nicholas Marston, managing director of KG Marketing, otherwise known as Kentish Garden, a soft- and stone-fruit growers' co-operative, whose 57 UK members currently supply around 50% of the strawberries we buy - four million packs a week at the peak of demand. </p> <p>So, with apologies to Wisbech, it is for Kent that we are now heading, to the village of Mereworth, just west of Maidstone, and the Hugh Lowe Farm, one of the founding members of Kentish Garden. </p> <p>Marion Regan has been MD here for five years, but the farm has been in the family since 1893, which is when strawberries - Royal Sovereigns, back then - were first planted in these fields. Few sites manage to sustain cultivation for so long a period (many will have suffered the ravages of the disease, strawberry sickness, or else will have succumbed to the developers and sold their land), but business here at the Hugh Lowe Farm is still booming. At peak season, the farm's energetic team of pickers will gather up to 90 tonnes a week. </p> <p>The secret of Mereworth's longevity is that the strawberries here are rotated with arable crops, which keeps the soil in tip-top condition and the fruit free from berry fatigue. \"And we make use of the different topography of the land,\" Regan points out. </p> <p>This is easy to see from the top of Kent's Greensand Ridge, where the views in any direction are of fields of glinting polythene. These never-ending plastic tunnels not only help to protect the plants from the harsher touches of the British weather - and there have been plenty of those so far this year - but also enable harvesting to be controlled and regulated over several months. The standard Elsanta variety of strawberry is a June-bearer, while other fields will crop later, for they are planted with Everest and Bolero varieties, everbearers that fruit right through until November. </p> <p>Today's growers are always looking for ways to extend the season - they don't want the strawberry \"year\" to be a mere five weeks any more than we consumers do. Fortunately, modern techniques keep the farmers more than busy, although, says Regan, \"we always try to have Saturdays off\". Sundays would be more conventional, of course, but this is impossible, seeing as Sunday's harvest feeds Monday's shoppers. </p> <p>The speed with which British strawberries wing their way from field to bowl is, in fact, their trump card: berries can be picked in the morning and be waiting, weighed and packed, in the supermarket depot the same evening. Compare this with four-day-old Spanish imports, or US strawberries, which take five to six days by air freight. </p> <p>Is this, perhaps, why strawberries from overseas just don't taste the same? \"That's the nature of imported fruit,\" says Angus Coates, fruit manager at Firmin's Farm in Linton, another Kentish Garden grower. \"Different varieties and different climates give them textures and flavours all their own. But the English is what you've been brought up with, and there's that very traditional flavour that you can immediately relate to. You can't beat an English strawberry.\" </p> <p>But can you improve on it? Last year, Firmin's invested heavily in a new table-top production system, in which the strawberries are planted in growbags raised above the soil. Coates believes that the approach has many advantages: \"The height aids picking,\" he says, \"but there's also better air movement, which means a better atmosphere, and less disease potential, which means less chemical input. And you can choose where to plant them, even at the top of a hill, or on stony ground.\" </p> <p>North-facing or south-facing, soil type, glasshouses, fields on the ridge or those in the weald of Kent - all these factors affect what strawberries can be grown, when they can be picked and, most important, how they taste. Those at Hugh Lowe Farm taste very good indeed, the slight differences in sweetness and juiciness evident in samples from two different fields (well, I had to). Growers also do their best to satisfy consumer craving for that perfect-tasting strawberry, tweaking the nutrients in the plants' liquid feed to affect the sugar levels, for example. </p> <p>Ultimately, though workers can keep the strawberries dry, warm or even cold through the season, human intervention is best kept to a minimum. Both farms introduce natural predators (assorted mites) to the strawberry tunnels, as well as bumble bees to aid pollination. Nature, it's true, doesn't get its own way when it comes to picking time, when a critical human eye must separate the supermarket grade (no splits, good colour, not mis-shapen) from the others. Most pass the test. At Hugh Lowe Farm, every tray of fruit is labelled not only with the field it was picked from, but also with the date and time it was picked, and even the name of the picker.

Marion Regan thinks so: \"It's not just about the visual quality, or even the eating quality.

      "body": "<p><strong> The Wild</strong> <br>Esther Freud <br>Hamish Hamilton, \u00a314.99, 248pp <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502420879,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>In Esther Freud's new novel we are on familiar if highly unpleasant terrain, the \"wild\" of the title being both a place and a reference to the savage ungovernability of a divided family. Tess, the nine-year-old from whose point of view we see nearly all the action, has come with her older brother Jake and mother Francine to The Wild, a rambling country house presided over by the smarmy William. He has three young daughters of his own, and loses no time in stamping his authority on the entire brood in a chilling approximation of The Brady Bunch. His idea of the good life, it seems, is a grim hybrid of self-sufficiency - nettle soup, chicken runs and nights spent crooning over the guitar - and rigid control by way of colour-coded domestic rotas. </p> <p>Perversely, Tess adores this faintly sinister patriarch, and hopes devoutly to wheedle her way into his affections. This, of course, is a recipe for disaster, as he barely tolerates her, her attempts to please meeting with a steady stream of rebuffs. Meanwhile, Jake loathes him and Francine hops into bed with him - along with a rather forward American girl on the run from a brainwashing sex cult. </p> <p>Although the plot line has all the hallmarks of literary clich\u00e9 - the excluded child, the slowly gathering menace of deep unhappiness and inevitable disillusionment - it would be a mistake to under-estimate Freud's considerable skill and subtlety. Above all, this is a novel about people desperately trying to paper over cracks they hardly dare admit are there, and pushing themselves further into incommunicable misery in the process. </p> <p>William is the foremost example of the self-defeating desire to unite and mollify, which, we slowly realise, is his own defence against a peculiar, masked urge to wound and control. On the telephone to his ex-wife, he callously limits her access to their children until she breaks down - and he is suddenly calm: \"The sound of her crying soothed him.\" And just as he devises endless ingenious activities to bring this disparate group of women and children together, he plots his own escape into other women's beds and the anonymous streets of Soho. By the end of the novel we hate him almost as much as does the unruly Jake, whose fierce cat Odin he destroys in a fit of pique. </p> <p>William is a kind of grown-up child, as is the deliberately undercharacterised, ineffective Francine, whom he quickly impregnates. But the real children of the novel are channelled into a maturity way beyond their grasp. For Tess, still imprisoned in a shameful nightmare of bed-wetting at nine, this takes the form of a neurotic urge to ward off disruption. \"I'd like to stamp on a glass cello,\" fumes Jake, in the face of another piece of William's spite. Tess's reply is characteristically and point-missingly anxious: \"Yes, but afterwards, just think, you'd have to sweep it up.\" </p> <p>Freud manages this disastrous household well, cleverly building up an atmosphere of claustrophobia and tension that becomes all the more ironic when we know that The Wild stands on the edge of a genteel suburban estate near East Grinstead. Similarly, Tess and Jake's mostly absent father, the louche writer Victor, is seen as a far safer bet, despite the ever-changing cast of girlfriends and the unexpected appearance of stray mysteriously fathered children. </p> <p>Freud is a sharp and intuitive writer, driven by a quiet analysis of emotional distress rather than by any self-conscious attempts at stylistic play. This, then, is a novel in a minor key, a study in the self-protecting - but ultimately self-destructive - lies we tell ourselves and one another as part of a doomed project to shore up the ruins. That delusion is excusable in children but less so in adults, and as the novel's accumulated nastinesses build into a rather more serious, violent ending, one sees the miserable price to be exacted when all concerned are bent on pursuing the uncertain rewards of the happy family.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Wild Esther Freud Hamish Hamilton, \u00a314.99, 248pp Buy it at BOL In Esther Freud's new novel we are on familiar if highly unpleasant terrain, the \"wild\" of the title being both a place and a reference to the savage ungovernability of a divided family. Tess, the nine-year-old from whose point of view we see nearly all the action, has come with her older brother Jake and mother Francine to The Wild, a rambling country house presided over by the smarmy William. He has three young daughters of his own, and loses no time in stamping his authority on the entire brood in a chilling approximation of The Brady Bunch. His idea of the good life, it seems, is a grim hybrid of self-sufficiency - nettle soup, chicken runs and nights spent crooning over the guitar - and rigid control by way of colour-coded domestic rotas. Perversely, Tess adores this faintly sinister patriarch, and hopes devoutly to wheedle her way into his affections. This, of course, is a recipe for disaster, as he barely tolerates her, her attempts to please meeting with a steady stream of rebuffs. Meanwhile, Jake loathes him and Francine hops into bed with him - along with a rather forward American girl on the run from a brainwashing sex cult. Although the plot line has all the hallmarks of literary clich\u00e9 - the excluded child, the slowly gathering menace of deep unhappiness and inevitable disillusionment - it would be a mistake to under-estimate Freud's considerable skill and subtlety. Above all, this is a novel about people desperately trying to paper over cracks they hardly dare admit are there, and pushing themselves further into incommunicable misery in the process. William is the foremost example of the self-defeating desire to unite and mollify, which, we slowly realise, is his own defence against a peculiar, masked urge to wound and control. On the telephone to his ex-wife, he callously limits her access to their children until she breaks down - and he is suddenly calm: \"The sound of her crying soothed him.\" And just as he devises endless ingenious activities to bring this disparate group of women and children together, he plots his own escape into other women's beds and the anonymous streets of Soho. By the end of the novel we hate him almost as much as does the unruly Jake, whose fierce cat Odin he destroys in a fit of pique. William is a kind of grown-up child, as is the deliberately undercharacterised, ineffective Francine, whom he quickly impregnates. But the real children of the novel are channelled into a maturity way beyond their grasp. For Tess, still imprisoned in a shameful nightmare of bed-wetting at nine, this takes the form of a neurotic urge to ward off disruption. \"I'd like to stamp on a glass cello,\" fumes Jake, in the face of another piece of William's spite. Tess's reply is characteristically and point-missingly anxious: \"Yes, but afterwards, just think, you'd have to sweep it up.\" Freud manages this disastrous household well, cleverly building up an atmosphere of claustrophobia and tension that becomes all the more ironic when we know that The Wild stands on the edge of a genteel suburban estate near East Grinstead. Similarly, Tess and Jake's mostly absent father, the louche writer Victor, is seen as a far safer bet, despite the ever-changing cast of girlfriends and the unexpected appearance of stray mysteriously fathered children. Freud is a sharp and intuitive writer, driven by a quiet analysis of emotional distress rather than by any self-conscious attempts at stylistic play. This, then, is a novel in a minor key, a study in the self-protecting - but ultimately self-destructive - lies we tell ourselves and one another as part of a doomed project to shore up the ruins. That delusion is excusable in children but less so in adults, and as the novel's accumulated nastinesses build into a rather more serious, violent ending, one sees the miserable price to be exacted when all concerned are bent on pursuing the uncertain rewards of the happy family.",

      "body": "<p>\"Everyone says my characters are weird,\" says Nicola Barker, \"but to me they seem normal.\" She doesn't seek the unusual: it always finds her. Like the schoolfriend's mum who lived with a tapeworm inside her to keep slim; or the butcher her father knew who'd seen a cancer run across his chopping block. </p> <p>Weirdness pays: Barker is about to go to Dublin to collect the world's biggest prize for a single work of fiction: the International Impac Award is worth \u00a375,000. </p> <p>Wide Open is set in a loony landscape - the Isle of Sheppey in Kent - where a cast of oddball brothers, a pornographer, a paedophile, several stroppy women, and a herd of boars interact frantically. </p> <p>Up till now, Barker's odd take on the world hasn't made a huge impact. After Cambridge, she skivvied through jobs at a bookies and a bakers to make time for writing. Faber signed her up as a bright young hope and, after two volumes of short stories and a couple of novels, popped the inevitable question: \"How about a big book now, Nicola?\" The result was Barker's latest novel - Five Miles from Outer Hope - published earlier this year. In hindsight, the big book might already have come - when Wide Open came out in 1998, it generated goodish reviews and reasonable sales, but only now has it won a prize and been mooted for a film. </p> <p>Barker, who is 34 and published her first novel, Love Your Enemies, in 1993, feels that Wide Open was hard done by. \"There was the feeling that the time wasn't really right for a novel like that. Nobody wanted serious novels at that point, especially from a woman.\" </p> <p>She is frustrated at the expectation that she should be what she dismissively calls \"a girl writer\". \"It's something I never wanted to be. Girl writers don't get taken seriously. I don't take them seriously. I am a boyish writer.\" </p> <p>In Wide Open, there is a mother and daughter, a pair Barker is clearly proud of: Sarah tending her smallholding on isolated in-grown Sheppey; coping, in the absence of her husband with that herd of boars - and the wilful, dirty-necked Lily (a weakness for the unwashed is one of Barker's eccentricities). This duo are certainly not anti-male (nor is Barker herself), but they have to deal with some troublesome men as boyfriends, neighbours and intruders. </p> <p>Barker, slight and fair, is a self-confessed tomboy. She lives in a bit of Hackney, east London, that even daytime taxi drivers are wary of; and, having banished her longtime partner (a music journalist) to another room during this interview, she talks surrounded by all manner of kitsch, including a madonna adorned with voodoo symbols from the Dominican Republic. </p> <p>Her off-centre fictional world isn't a literary device. It is the way she really sees things: there's always a missing person in the families she invents; one character will often have mutilated himself or herself, like the man who has fed his hand to an owl.

      "bodyText": "\"Everyone says my characters are weird,\" says Nicola Barker, \"but to me they seem normal.\" She doesn't seek the unusual: it always finds her. Like the schoolfriend's mum who lived with a tapeworm inside her to keep slim; or the butcher her father knew who'd seen a cancer run across his chopping block. Weirdness pays: Barker is about to go to Dublin to collect the world's biggest prize for a single work of fiction: the International Impac Award is worth \u00a375,000. Wide Open is set in a loony landscape - the Isle of Sheppey in Kent - where a cast of oddball brothers, a pornographer, a paedophile, several stroppy women, and a herd of boars interact frantically. Up till now, Barker's odd take on the world hasn't made a huge impact. After Cambridge, she skivvied through jobs at a bookies and a bakers to make time for writing. Faber signed her up as a bright young hope and, after two volumes of short stories and a couple of novels, popped the inevitable question: \"How about a big book now, Nicola?\" The result was Barker's latest novel - Five Miles from Outer Hope - published earlier this year. In hindsight, the big book might already have come - when Wide Open came out in 1998, it generated goodish reviews and reasonable sales, but only now has it won a prize and been mooted for a film. Barker, who is 34 and published her first novel, Love Your Enemies, in 1993, feels that Wide Open was hard done by. \"There was the feeling that the time wasn't really right for a novel like that. Nobody wanted serious novels at that point, especially from a woman.\" She is frustrated at the expectation that she should be what she dismissively calls \"a girl writer\". \"It's something I never wanted to be. Girl writers don't get taken seriously. I don't take them seriously. I am a boyish writer.\" In Wide Open, there is a mother and daughter, a pair Barker is clearly proud of: Sarah tending her smallholding on isolated in-grown Sheppey; coping, in the absence of her husband with that herd of boars - and the wilful, dirty-necked Lily (a weakness for the unwashed is one of Barker's eccentricities). This duo are certainly not anti-male (nor is Barker herself), but they have to deal with some troublesome men as boyfriends, neighbours and intruders. Barker, slight and fair, is a self-confessed tomboy. She lives in a bit of Hackney, east London, that even daytime taxi drivers are wary of; and, having banished her longtime partner (a music journalist) to another room during this interview, she talks surrounded by all manner of kitsch, including a madonna adorned with voodoo symbols from the Dominican Republic. Her off-centre fictional world isn't a literary device. It is the way she really sees things: there's always a missing person in the families she invents; one character will often have mutilated himself or herself, like the man who has fed his hand to an owl. A creative, baroque act, says Barker, who admits she has been fascinated by amputees since girlhood. And as for the maddeningly unexplained events that kick off her plots - what is the link between the drifter and his would-be rescuer (both called Ronny) at the start of Wide Open? - they're always there for a reason. Barker says: \"I like to write something that people have to struggle to understand; something to get over a prejudice.\" The behaviour of one of the Ronnies, who keeps his soul in a box, only uses his left hand and keeps vigil on a motorway bridge, certainly tests the reader's patience. It is explained only at the end of the book as the result, in adolescence, of having a father who was a child abuser. \"There is so much fiction and TV about violent events - a crime, a stabbing. I'm not interested in that; this book is about how the personality continues when it has endured a huge amount of trauma.\" Some of that might also echo back to being transplanted into South Africa's unsettling society for five years as a child; witnessing apartheid, then coming back, as a 14-year-old, to home counties Britain with her mother after her parents split up.

What makes In America an object of interest is less its page-turning readability than its significance as the latest move in Susan Sontag's brilliant career. Ever since she declined to finish her PhD in 1957, Sontag has been the loosest of intellectual cannons. Her books, like those of her admired Roland Barthes, defy prediction. Who would have thought that in her sixties, with The Volcano Lover, this \"high priestess of radical chic\" would turn to romantic fiction - \"that Hamilton Woman\", no less? </p> <p>Like its predecessor, In America is lush, multi-voiced, woman-centred and densely historical. It is also, if one looks for glimpses and hints, one of the more personal of Sontag's many books. In the prelude \"Chapter Zero\" she imagines herself, a contemporary American, transported to a hotel in 1870s Krakow. She eavesdrops on a group of Poles - theatrical types, it transpires - who are destined to be the \"dramatis personae\" of her novel. Sontag tells us that this prelude, the Jamesian \"germ\" of In America (the Master, incidentally, has a cameo part later in the narrative), took a year to write. </p> <p>While musing on the diva who holds the company spellbound, Sontag notes: \"I remember when I first read Middlemarch: I had just turned 18, and a third of the way through the book burst into tears because I realised not only that I was Dorothea but that a few months earlier, I had married Mr Casaubon... It took me nine years to decide that I had the right, the moral right, to divorce Mr Casaubon.\" This, we apprehend, will be the story of a Dorothea who does not, like George Eliot's heroine, bury herself in the obscurity of \"private\" good works. She will shine in the public blaze of celebrity. </p> <p>There are huge difficulties in coming to terms with In America. Few readers outside the Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 community will know where it is coming from (it cost me a day looking things up in my local library). In 1876, Helena Modrzejewska, at 35 years old Poland's greatest actress, emigrated to the \"Brave New World\" of America. Trailing behind her came her husband and her lover, the writer Henryk Sinkiewicz (later famous as the author of Quo Vadis, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and - as Sontag disdainfully calls him - \"the worst writer in the history of the world\").</p> <p>Helena was, although a mere woman, the moving spirit of the enterprise. The Poles set up a utopian community in Anaheim, southern California (now the site of Disneyland - with which Sontag has some sly fun). It failed, as did both Helena's marriage and her love affair. She went on, despite her age and the difficulties of mastering a foreign language, to become a star of the American stage - a rival to Sarah Bernhardt and Ellen Terry. She changed her stage name to Helena Modjeska, which was still recognisably Polish - she was \"in America\", not \"American\". </p> <p>Perplexingly, Sontag changes some, but not all, the names of her historical characters. Modjeska becomes Maryna Zalezowska (stage name \"Zalenska\"); Sinkiewicz becomes Ryszard Kierul. But the actor Edwin Booth, whose long monologue ends the novel, is Edwin Booth (as Henry James is Henry James). Very mysterious. For those readers who are serious about In America (and I suspect the author would want no others), some preliminary study of Modjeska's 1910 autobiography, Memories and Impressions, is mandatory. </p> <p>Sontag offers two reasons for writing In America. All four of her grandparents came from Poland. She herself, in the three years of the novel's conception, frequently visited \"besieged Sarajevo\" (the novel is dedicated to her friends in that unhappy city). Sontag sees parallels between war-torn Bosnia and 19th-century Poland, and they are not hard to see. </p> <p>But the main inspiration is clearly the luminous and irresistibly magnetic personality of Helena Maryna. This heroine did not follow her menfolk to America; they followed her. She made her career and achieved her stardom, even if it meant ditching the men in her life. It was, as Sontag says of herself and her luckless discarded Mr Casaubon, \"morally right\" to do so. The truly womanly thing to do, that is.</p>",

She changed her stage name to Helena Modjeska, which was still recognisably Polish - she was \"in America\", not \"American\". Perplexingly, Sontag changes some, but not all, the names of her historical characters. Modjeska becomes Maryna Zalezowska (stage name \"Zalenska\"); Sinkiewicz becomes Ryszard Kierul. But the actor Edwin Booth, whose long monologue ends the novel, is Edwin Booth (as Henry James is Henry James). Very mysterious. For those readers who are serious about In America (and I suspect the author would want no others), some preliminary study of Modjeska's 1910 autobiography, Memories and Impressions, is mandatory. Sontag offers two reasons for writing In America. All four of her grandparents came from Poland. She herself, in the three years of the novel's conception, frequently visited \"besieged Sarajevo\" (the novel is dedicated to her friends in that unhappy city). Sontag sees parallels between war-torn Bosnia and 19th-century Poland, and they are not hard to see. But the main inspiration is clearly the luminous and irresistibly magnetic personality of Helena Maryna. This heroine did not follow her menfolk to America; they followed her. She made her career and achieved her stardom, even if it meant ditching the men in her life. It was, as Sontag says of herself and her luckless discarded Mr Casaubon, \"morally right\" to do so. The truly womanly thing to do, that is.",

And it takes extraordinary good fortune to bring a book back from the ever-expanding graveyard of fiction. John Fante's Ask the Dust is one such (deservedly) fortunate work, and the story of its rediscovery is the stuff of every out-of-print author's dreams.</p> <p>When it was first published in 1939, Ask the Dust, Fante's second novel, received little publicity and sold poorly (its publishers, Stackpole, were involved in an expensive lawsuit over their unauthorised publication of Mein Kampf). By 1940, like many other writers, Fante turned to Hollywood to make a living. He kept writing fiction, but many of his works went unpublished (indeed, many of his screenplays were unproduced). Ask the Dust took its place in the Los Angeles Public Library. </p> <p>There, over the years, all sorts of people came upon it, fell in love with it, urged it on their friends and wrote long admiring letters to the author, hoping he was still alive. Robert Towne discovered it while researching his screenplay Chinatown, and declared it to be the best novel ever written about Los Angeles. This was enough to send Stephen Cooper, the author of a new biography of Fante, Full of Life, in search of that well-worn library copy. </p> <p>But the key figure in Fante's resurrection was novelist and poet Charles Bukowski, who read the book in the public library while \"starving and drinking and trying to be a writer\", and who subsequently described Fante as his \"god\". By the late 1970s Bukowski was an international success and in a position to urge his publishers, Black Sparrow Press, to reissue Ask the Dust, \"the finest novel written in all time\".</p> <p>In 1980, three years before Fante's death, the book appeared to rave reviews. Today most of Fante's work is in print (including three novels unpublished before his death) and since 1980, 100,000 copies of his books have been sold in the United States, with nearly half a million copies sold in France. Ask the Dust and Fante's 1938 novel Wait Until Spring, Bandini were published in Britain last year. </p> <p>The latter introduces Fante's alter ego, Arturo Bandini, in the days surrounding his 12th Christmas in snowy small-town Colorado. On the surface it is a tender and lyrical account of the traumas of adolescence. Arturo keeps a daily tally of his freckles and wants to be a good boy, only \"he was afraid to be a good boy because he was afraid his friends would call him a good boy.\"</p> <p>The real strength of the book, however, lies in its depiction of the parents and its balanced sympathies. Svevo, the father, struggles to be American and is weak; Maria, the mother, endures all and finds America an irrelevance. Arturo, proud and angry, fights to save their marriage through a winter that seems never to end. While Maria turns to her rosary for a \"beaded passage into escape\" and Svevo retreats to the bottle and the bed of the town's wealthy widow, Arturo hides in the warmth of the movie theatre. But these \"drugged enchantments\" provide only temporary relief; the brutal facts of poverty and human frailty are inescapable for the Bandini family. </p> <p>In Ask the Dust we find Arturo struggling to find love and literary fame in an inhospitable but mesmerising Los Angeles. A tale of poverty, racism and desire, its humour is wry and forgiving and its stylistic energy compelling. In the same year that Nathaniel West created his enduringly apocalyptic version of LA in The Day of the Locust, Bandini wooed the city: \"Los Angeles, give me some of you! Los Angeles come to me the way I come to you, my feet over your streets, you pretty town I loved you so much, you sad flower in the sand, you pretty town.\"</p> <p>Two further Bandini novels are yet to come out in Britain: Fante's wildly exuberant first novel (only published in the States in 1985), The Road to Los Angeles, and his last work, Dreams from Bunker Hill (1982), a mordantly funny look at life as a \"Hollywood whore\", dictated to his wife after he became blind. </p> <p>Whether Fante's writings are fictional autobiography, autobiographical fictions or, as biographer Cooper would have it, meditative confessions, it is certainly true that they are vivid reimaginings of his own life. Reading Cooper's sensitive and balanced biography, one becomes aware of what was reinvented, and why. Fante was born into an Italian immigrant family in Colorado in 1909, a time when anti-Italian and anti-Catholic feeling was running high. (By the 1920s, there was intense Klu Klux Klan activity in Colorado, much of it directed against Italian-Americans.) Racist slurs were common - among the humiliating memories recalled in a wonderful early story, \"The Odyssey of a Wop\", is being called just that by a Jesuit school principal. </p> <p>Family life was no more harmonious. His mother suffered conspicuously, while the whole family feared, loathed and loved his attractive, neglectful father. Much of Fante's work explores his ambiguous relationship with the father whose name, Nick, he frequently took as his own. Writing opened the door to another world, and money, whether tainted by Hollywood or not, was something impossible to refuse. </p> <p>Fante's writing is sometimes compared with that of contemporaries John Steinbeck and JG Farrell because of its concern with the lives of the poor. But his fiction has no socialist or even muck-raking agenda, and as such is both more humorous and more pessimistic than most 1930s proletarian writing. Fante was sceptical of what he called \"parlour Marxism\", and his great influences were the intensely subjective Knut Hamsun and Catholicism itself. \"My business in life is to save myself,\" he wrote to his mentor, HL Mencken. \"That's a tremendous job. I shall not dirty my hands trying to save the masses.\"</p>",

And yet primatology is the only area of science in which women outnumber men. Women make up 62 per cent of members of the World Directory of Primatologists; women run 90 per cent of primate sanctuaries. </p> <p>Ironically, it was a man who was responsible for introducing women to primatology. Louis Leakey, a paleoanthropologist based in Kenya, selected and funded the three most famous female primatologists: Jane Goodall, who studies chimpanzees, Dian Fossey, who devoted her life to gorillas, and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas, who works with orang-utans.</p> <p>Leakey wanted primatology to be the study of the similarities between us and our nearest living relatives, the apes. A well-known womaniser, he was in love with Goodall and later Fossey. He chose naive women who were intellectual blank slates, often beautiful (Goodall was a 23-year-old blonde when they first met), and willing to live in remote areas of the jungle for at least five years while remaining totally reliant on him for academic guidance, support and money. Goodall called him \"Fairy Foster Father\"; his pet name for her was Mwendwa, Kikuyu for \"My Most Beloved\". </p> <p>According to Carole Jahme, author of Beauty and the Beasts, a discourse on women and apes, these women have come to represent three archetypal images, and have inspired legions of fans and a new generation of primatologists. Jane Goodall's supporters tend to be middle-class women who admire chimpanzees and believe them to be the most intelligent ape; Dian Fossey attracts women who are disappointed with mankind and idolise the natural world; and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas's fans are spiritual conservationists who want to save the rainforest and the jewel in the jungle's crown, the orang-utan.</p> <p>Their fame spread not through academia but via the media: Leakey persuaded National Geographic to feature his women and their apes in what are now landmark films. Naturally, the filmmakers portrayed the women in a particular light: Goodall and Fossey, both nubile white women, were shown reaching out and touching the black fur of our savage ape cousins in the dark heart of Africa. As Jahme says, \"The published images of the vulnerable women 'alone' with their apes were so powerful that they captured the imagination of the general public.\" </p> <p>But just what is it about women and apes? Why are so many female scientists drawn to this field? Jahme believes, like Leakey, that it is because women are better at picking up non-verbal cues. Primed to be able to \"read\" a baby's or a man's intentions and desires without words, women are better at understanding primate motivations. \"When women choose to study and communicate with non-human primates they are effectively choosing to return to a time before language evolved.\" Jahme continues, \"65% per cent of human language is non-verbal. Most of the time we instinctively communicate with one another by means other than the spoken word, using eye contact, facial expression and gesture.\" As, of course, do primates. </p> <p>Leakey also thought that women were ideally suited to study primates because, as Jahme says, \"women were inherently patient and silent observers, whereas men were ambitious hierarchical careerists. A life of near-poverty watching animals live out long lives for 10 hours a day, decade by decade, was not going to turn men on at all\". Jahme thinks that it is the male ego that has prevented men from disappearing into the jungle for years, and that the women she describes do not seem to be looking for fame and fortune. </p> <p>When Goodall first began to publish papers, the academic world was horrified that she assigned gender to her animals and called them by name instead of giving them numbers. It was pioneering work such as Goodall's that allowed scientists to recognise the role female apes play in primate societies, and that individuals do matter: some apes make good friends, while there are bullies, thugs, peacekeepers and troublemakers, high-rankers and no-hopers in every chimpanzee group.</p> <p>The ability of female primatologists to sit and observe all day, to look at all individuals and their activities - not just the infrequent but dramatic incidents, such as fights - has led to insights that arguably only women would have had. For example, Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, author of Mother Nature, has a theory that stems from her work watching male langurs killing infants and from seeing the obvious enjoyment female primates take in having sex. She thinks that the female orgasm originally evolved so that females would be encouraged to have sex with more than one mate, so that every male might think an infant was theirs and either care for the baby or, at the very least, not kill it (male primates will kill infants that are not theirs so that the female will come into season quickly and bear their offspring). </p> <p>Jahme's book, while it is an interesting and insightful guide to \"female\" primatology, is not particularly well structured, and does not truly get to the heart of why women are interested in apes. Women may be better at understanding non-verbal cues and could be more patient than men, but if they are so skilled socially, then why do they abandon family and friends in pursuit of life in the jungle with only apes for company? In the past society would not allow them to pursue the kind of autonomy they have in the rainforest, but the situation has (hopefully) changed. </p> <p>It is left to primatologist Sue Savage-Rumbaugh to suggest fleetingly that women are successful in this field because it is a new one - yet so is nanotechnology. Arguably, many modern female primatologists do behave like men, spending one to two years in the field before publishing papers and launching their career. Frequently, papers published on ape psychology are by men (perhaps because this requires working with captive apes), and there are increasing numbers of men, such as Bill McGrew, Richard Wrangham and Christophe Boesche, who have been inspired by the three female pioneers to spend years in the field themselves.

He is chiefly memorable as a partner in one of the great doomed love affairs of literary history. Here he is often presented as the villain, but it was not, as Douglas Murray makes clear in this generous biography, a one-sided disaster, with Oscar Wilde the passive victim of a beautiful, cock-teasing brat. </p> <p>Their affair was more evenly matched than that, and also grimly familiar. A glance at any newspaper's court reports shows that it is not at all uncommon for a couple to share a destructive love that ruins each other's happiness and that of their family and friends. History sides with Wilde because he was incomparably the better person and the better writer. </p> <p>It was Douglas who was the sexual revolutionary of the pair; he was much more daring than Wilde, who was content to laugh secretly at contemporary society, sniggeringly inserting references to homosexual slang such as \"Ernest\" or \"Bunburying\" into his works - clues that the sexual underworld would recognise while the bourgeois public saw only the play.</p> <p>Douglas, however, wanted to conceal nothing: he would not only be homosexual, he would spread the message of a better form of love. It was Douglas who wrote of \"the Love that dare not speak its name\" in an undergraduate magazine, and even after Wilde's imprisonment wrote: \"I am proud that I have been loved by a great poet... sodomites, and I know a great many, are intellectually superior to other men.\" His public pronouncements and letters detailing how he had made love with this or that boy were to dog him in later life, when he developed a new persona as the scourge of all deviants, cursing former friends in public as \"a bugger\" or \"a habitual sodomite\". </p> <p>His conversion followed the consummation of another interesting relationship, between Douglas and the bisexual poet Olive Custance, who was one of the few women to be associated with the decadents. He made his attraction to her quite clear: \"You are a darling Baby and you are exactly like a boy and you know perfectly well that I love you better than anyone else, boy or girl.\" </p> <p>After a few years of happiness, Olive and her family also became victims of Douglas's demented outpourings. He was particularly vicious when she judiciously put her inheritance out of his reach to prevent him from squandering it on the libel actions to which he was addicted. He renounced their son at the age of 14 for \"plotting\" with Olive, and would address her in letters as \"you miserable woman\". </p> <p>Douglas finally got what he had long so richly deserved: a prison sentence for a criminal libel on Churchill, who was said to have issued false information on the Battle of Jutland in order to assist Jewish financiers in Britain and Germany. Murray is wrong, though, to suggest that \"the majority of the British public\" in the 1920s believed in anti-Jewish conspiracy theories; very few people were ever taken in by the bizarre conspiracies about Jewish world domination, and the court found no difficulty in ripping through the tissue of nonsense Douglas had issued to give him six months in Wormwood Scrubs. </p> <p>In an excess of spite worthy of Douglas himself, the prison authorities refused to let him keep the manuscript book of poems he had written in prison. It is a tribute to Murray's determination that the manuscript is now released, although the world could have got on well enough without Douglas's sonnet referring to Churchill's Jewish mother that starts \"The leprous spawn of scattered Israel/ Spread its contagion in your English blood.\" Murray has a hard time attempting to elevate Douglas's poetry, but it is fun to see the old hater's comments on Eliot, \"the supreme enemy of poetry\", and his letter to Yeats explaining quite why the Nobel Laureate was the minor and Douglas himself the major poet. </p> <p>While the publicity for this biography makes much of the author's youth (he is still an undergraduate), this is more a triumph of publishing than of literature: many of us finished books while we were still undergraduates, but it is Murray's unusual achievement to see his in print. And it is well worthwhile: Alfred Douglas is fascinating in the way that truly horrible people often are. \"I have been badly treated all my life,\" he whined in old age. At 63, remembering his 21st birthday, he wrote, \"I was so overcome with melancholy at the thought of my vanished youth that I retired after dinner to my bedroom and wept.\" It would be difficult to find a man more undeserving of tears.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> What If</strong><br>ed by Robert Cowley <br>Macmillan \u00a320, 395pp</p> <p>Let us praise meteorologist JM Stagg, to whom we owe the world as we know it. In the early hours of a June day, as Atlantic rain beat against south-coast window panes, he guessed it would ease by dawn, and after would follow 36 clearer hours. The man he was advising asked for a guarantee, and Stagg laughed. Both knew certainty was impossible: June predictions are wrong half the time. \"OK,\" said General Dwight D Eisenhower, supreme commander of the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe (already postponed by a day because of the gale). \"Let's go.\" And he gave the order that sent Operation Overlord to the Normandy beaches on D-day, June 6 1944. </p> <p>But what if Stagg's hunch had been wrong? Eisenhower could have recalled the invasion, but he would have revealed his destination. And if he had steamed ahead into bad weather, he could not have sent in air cover or reinforcements; his storm-tossed first-wave troops would have been captured or cut down by shore defences. He already had his statement of failure and resignation prepared. As the Allies slowly advanced from southern French beaches, Hitler might have made peace with Russia; Stalin might have ordered the Red Army through Europe to the Channel coast; and the atomic bomb would have been dropped on Berlin in summer 1945. That's the alternative version proposed by Stephen Ambrose, based on his researches into D-day. </p> <p>Of the 30 speculations in this book, his is the easiest to connect with: who hasn't erred in a decision based on a desperate desire for good weather?

      "bodyText": "What If ed by Robert Cowley Macmillan \u00a320, 395pp Let us praise meteorologist JM Stagg, to whom we owe the world as we know it. In the early hours of a June day, as Atlantic rain beat against south-coast window panes, he guessed it would ease by dawn, and after would follow 36 clearer hours. The man he was advising asked for a guarantee, and Stagg laughed. Both knew certainty was impossible: June predictions are wrong half the time. \"OK,\" said General Dwight D Eisenhower, supreme commander of the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe (already postponed by a day because of the gale). \"Let's go.\" And he gave the order that sent Operation Overlord to the Normandy beaches on D-day, June 6 1944. But what if Stagg's hunch had been wrong? Eisenhower could have recalled the invasion, but he would have revealed his destination. And if he had steamed ahead into bad weather, he could not have sent in air cover or reinforcements; his storm-tossed first-wave troops would have been captured or cut down by shore defences. He already had his statement of failure and resignation prepared. As the Allies slowly advanced from southern French beaches, Hitler might have made peace with Russia; Stalin might have ordered the Red Army through Europe to the Channel coast; and the atomic bomb would have been dropped on Berlin in summer 1945. That's the alternative version proposed by Stephen Ambrose, based on his researches into D-day. Of the 30 speculations in this book, his is the easiest to connect with: who hasn't erred in a decision based on a desperate desire for good weather? And who hasn't stepped in front of a taxi, as did Winston Churchill in New York in 1931: an inch, a millisecond, and a minor politician who was running late would have been remembered for first world war failure in the Dardanelles, while in 1940, the British prime minister, Lord Halifax, would have surrendered to Germany, leading to Nazi victory in the 1939-47 war.. Exercises in counter-factual history such as these are based on the principle that what happened, happened - but only just, and far more accidentally and uncontrollably then we can bear to consider. This is especially true of battlefields, such as the one where humans risked all their futures on the motor reactions of a bodyguard to Alexander (22, and not as yet that Great), who speared a Persian as he hefted his axe for the blow that would have brained the king and denied the world Greek philosophy, art and literature. It could all, always, have been so different: if only it hadn't been such a wet summer in 1529 (the Ottoman Turks would have taken Vienna); if God's winds hadn't scattered the Armada (all the New World would be Spanish-speaking Latin America); if Genghis Khan's third son had not expired, obliging his Mongol clansman to gallop back to the steppes to elect a leader (Paris, Rome and Catholic Christianity would have been obliterated)...

In Available Light, he has assembled eleven essays that look back on a distinguished career as an ethnographer and forward to issues likely to confound his field in future. The book is impeccably written - droll, animated, and bright in both senses of the word - and should enlighten lay readers as well as specialists. </p> <p>Anthropologists, writes Geertz, \"hawk the anomalous, peddle the strange\"; they are \"merchants of astonishment\". Wryly he mourns the loss of the primitive extremes on which this relatively young discipline cut its teeth: \"Difference will doubtless remain - the French will never eat salted butter.

While the ill-defined field routinely steps on toes in sociology, history, psychology, archaeology and the cognitive sciences, encounters with the Other can prove as fruitful in academia as in Morocco. More, he is a great advocate of anthropology's hit-or-miss methodology of simply venturing forth: \"We have turned out to be rather good at waddling in. In our confusion is our strength.\" </p> <p>In perhaps his most revelatory essay, \"Anti Anti-Relativism\", he defends this much-maligned whipping boy of conservatives, who equate cultural relativism with lobotomised neutrality - a refusal to pass judgment on those who are not worse but merely \"different\" that amounts to moral cowardice.</p> <p>Geertz clarifies: relativism merely recognises that we all come from a \"special somewhere\" that influences how we think. The term does not entail an apology for those origins or a refusal to apply their subjective standards. Rather, if you're going to condemn something, you're better off knowing what it is first. Hence westerners are wise to accept that the repellent nature of female circumcision may not seem self-evident to Somalis. Or, to cite one of the many distilled kickers with which Geertz is prone to conclude his paragraphs, \"If we wanted home truths, we should have stayed home.\" </p> <p>Geertz sees parochialism as a hazard more considerable than an overabundance of understanding: no war has raged because antagonists empathised with one another to excess. Though the complacency of ethnocentrism beckons, \"We must learn to grasp what we cannot embrace... without smoothing it over with vacant murmurs of common humanity, disarming it with to-each-his-own indifferentism, or dismissing it as charming, lovely even, but inconsequent.\" </p> <p>In his final essay, \"The World in Pieces\", Geertz portrays foreignness as anything but inconsequent. Examining ethnic and religious conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, Indonesia and Quebec, Geertz addresses the irony that while the post-Cold War world grows more technologically and economically global, it also grows more politically divided.</p> <p>In 1945, there were about 50 countries; now there are nearly 200, and larger powers continue to atomise into new states. With accelerating immigration, even long-established countries are fragmenting from within. Multiculturalism sounds progressive, but melting pots court identity crises.

It does still happen this way, but less frequently. </p> <p>\"The pace is so fast,\" says Prof Richardson, \"few people have time to train entrants on the job. Companies are a lot leaner and a lot of work is outsourced, so there is a core team which does not have the time to do training.\" </p> <p>Publishing houses, therefore, look for people with added value who can bring in skills and get going straight away.

In these areas of specialist commissioning, the editor is orchestrating events. They have the ideas and work with designers, illustrator, writers, or team of writers, like the conductor of an orchestra. A high proportion of my students do not choose fiction,\" Prof Richardson says. </p> <p>That is not to say that working as a fiction editor is without huge reward, just that the relationship with the writer is usually mediated through an agent and it is the agent who is more likely to develop the ideas. </p> <p>Whatever their role, the commissioning editor needs a very high degree of good interpersonal skills. </p> <p>At one end of the job they need negotiating skills to deal with their own marketing and publicity people, the book trade to persuade them of the virtue of their project and get their backing. They have to be team players. And, at the other end of their job, they have to maintain a good relationship with their authors. </p> <p>\"The author needs support,\" explains Prof Richardson, \"and it is a delicate relationship, especially if the editor has to persuade them to make changes.\" </p> <p>The hours expected of publishing staff, says the Publishing Training Centre's Graham Smith, can be long and demanding for comparatively small financial reward. \"Commissioning is perhaps the role with the highest profile and potential rewards attached - and, with them, the higher risk if something goes wrong,\" he adds. </p> <p>Most commissioning editors are educated to first degree level, although the subject is not crucial. \"It obviously helps,\" says Smith, \"to have a good understanding of science and technology if those are the areas covered by the publisher, but the ability to assimilate details of specialist topics can overcome any shortfall in expert knowledge.\" </p> <p>Expert knowledge is more critical for a proof reader or copy editor and these people are the unseen army at the heart of the publishing world. </p> <p>As a result of down-sizing fewer publishing houses employ in-house copy editors and proof readers.

The SFEP runs a series of training courses both in proof reading and copy editing - and both skills are closely allied. </p> <p>The society says that some people find it confusing to learn copy editing before they are confident of their proof reading skills, but others like to learn both disciplines together. </p> <p>\"Many prefer to minimise the risk they are taking by not investing in copy editing training until they are earning money by proof reading,\" says the society. </p> <p>It goes on to warn: \"If you are having difficulty obtaining proof reading work, you are unlikely to find it any easier to obtain copy editing work.\" </p> <p>Nor will you earn megabucks. \"Most publishers pay in the range of \u00a38 to \u00a312 an hour,\" says the SFEP. \"Some newcomers earn as little as \u00a34 an hour.

But first, you have to recognise them. \"We are good at knowing what we can't do, but not very good at knowing what we can do,\" says personal and business coach Maria Hemming. \"There is something about the human psyche that can stop us from seeing our own abilities.\" </p> <p>To help her clients overcome this barrier Hemming asks them to answer the following: </p> <p>What do you love to do?<br> What do you do naturally well? <br> What is your greatest strength? <br> What is your greatest desire? <br> What are you most proud of? <br> What do you daydream about? <br> If you won the lottery, how would you fill your days? <br> What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? <br> How do you want to be remembered? </p> <p>These questions are designed to enable people to realise what makes them unique.

First, it creates a positive, productive energy around you - something that can be very attractive to prospective employers. Secondly, it helps you perform better in the interview. You feel more successful, therefore you can be more successful.\" </p> <p>Finding a hidden talent can also be rather useful at an interpersonal level. If you've realised you have a particular flair or passion, it may be appropriate to mention it during the interview as a way of demonstrating your individuality. \"This can make you stand out from the other candidates,\" says Jonathan Mansfield-Clarke, director of Absolute Graduates. \"It can show that you are lateral, creative, enthusiastic, energetic and just that bit distinctive.\" </p> <p>Shantal Abu Sharar, a graduate recruitment advisor with Price Jamieson, agrees. When all the other elements are equal, she says, talking about a hidden talent can give you a competitive edge. \"You can be seen to be a rounded and interesting individual and this can be important to employers.\" </p> <p>It worked for \"Romany\", who runs her own London-based business specialising in \"high society entertainment\". After graduating from Manchester University with a degree in English and Italian, her first job was as a BT sales executive. </p> <p>During the interview, Romany used her long-discovered flair for all things theatrical to great effect. \"I argued that people won't buy telephones from someone who is dry and dull. But they will buy them from someone who can perform with passion and energy.\" </p> <p>The key, she says, is to look for links between your hidden talent and the job on offer. Recognise the skill sets involved in both and explain how they connect. Having an eye for photography, for instance, could demonstrate an ability to process new information, to identify new opportunities, to express ideas visually and to accomplish all of that within seconds. </p> <p>You will need to apply what's called the \"feature-advantage-benefit rule\". Mansfield-Clarke explains: \"First, look for the feature in yourself. Second, understand how it creates an advantage for you.
