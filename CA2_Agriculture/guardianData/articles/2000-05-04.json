The assessment of his close friend and former club-mate is unlikely to have him downing a celebratory vodka, though the thought of \u00a325,000 a week might ease the pain. </p> <p>\"I think he could have chosen to go to a better club than Spurs,\" said Luzhny, who would be well advised to don a wig and dark glasses on his next visit to N17. \"It may not have depended on him, of course.

Showing an impeccable understanding of north London rivalry, the Arsenal defender announced that his fellow Ukraine international Sergei Rebrov should have joined a \"better club\" than Spurs. Rebrov expects to complete a \u00a310m move from Dynamo Kiev to Tottenham in the next fortnight. The assessment of his close friend and former club-mate is unlikely to have him downing a celebratory vodka, though the thought of \u00a325,000 a week might ease the pain. \"I think he could have chosen to go to a better club than Spurs,\" said Luzhny, who would be well advised to don a wig and dark glasses on his next visit to N17. \"It may not have depended on him, of course. It might have been to do with the price. If it had been lower I suspect he would have gone to a better club.\" Perhaps he had Arsenal in mind.

      "body": "<p>The merged London and Frankfurt stock exchange, iX, is likely to seek its own stock market listing next year, according to its chief executive designate, Werner Seifert. </p> <p>He told shareholders in Deutsche B\u00f6rse that the Frankfurt exchange's plans for a listing would have to be called off in the light of the planned merger. </p> <p>Speaking at the exchange's annual meeting, Mr Seifert said that because the creation of iX \"a flotation in 2001 promises to be even more interesting\". </p> <p>He also gave more details of the savings to be gained, estimating that pre-tax synergies would be around \u20ac150m (\u00a386m) a year, but warned that in the first years after the merger restructur ing costs would amount to around \u20ac100m a year. </p> <p>Under the terms of the merger, trading in blue chip stocks will be centred on London while Frankfurt will provide the trading system and be the centre for dealings in growth stocks. </p> <p>The merger still needs the approval of both sets of shareholders.

      "bodyText": "The merged London and Frankfurt stock exchange, iX, is likely to seek its own stock market listing next year, according to its chief executive designate, Werner Seifert. He told shareholders in Deutsche B\u00f6rse that the Frankfurt exchange's plans for a listing would have to be called off in the light of the planned merger. Speaking at the exchange's annual meeting, Mr Seifert said that because the creation of iX \"a flotation in 2001 promises to be even more interesting\". He also gave more details of the savings to be gained, estimating that pre-tax synergies would be around \u20ac150m (\u00a386m) a year, but warned that in the first years after the merger restructur ing costs would amount to around \u20ac100m a year. Under the terms of the merger, trading in blue chip stocks will be centred on London while Frankfurt will provide the trading system and be the centre for dealings in growth stocks. The merger still needs the approval of both sets of shareholders. A timetable for the proposals to be put to the shareholders has not been drawn up but executives from London and Frankfurt are likely to see the issue put to the vote before the end of June or early July if much of the work on integration is to be completed before the end of the year. Mr Seifert's remarks indicate that an iX initial public offering could take place early in 2001. The problem for the architects of the merger is the sheer volume of work to be done. In addition to winning support for the deal, they are committed to negotiations with Milan and Madrid, which have signed memorandums of understanding with London and Frankfurt. They will also have to decide on relations with other exchanges, from London's derivatives market, Liffe, to Euronext - the tripartite merger of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges.

      "body": "<p>When you have listened to someone's music for almost a decade, they weirdly but inevitably start to feel like an old friend. Hooking up again is a joyful, comforting experience, even if you haven't been in contact for a few months or years. An hour slips by catching up on the news and gauging the changes; then another, as shared memories resurface and favourite stories are uproariously, wistfully retold. </p> <p>Lou Barlow's one-off gig - an exhausting yet exhilarating 35-odd song set ostensibly designed to promote the Folk Implosion albums but stretching to accommodate the Sebadoh back-catalogue - had exactly that structure, that heart-warming quality. The changes were startling: from being utterly incommunicative on stage, Barlow has transformed into the kind of affable, engaging performer who part- jokingly, part-lovingly asks: \"How else can I serenade you, my fair audience?\" and is then so unfazed by one prankster's ridiculous request for the Stone Roses' I Wanna Be Adored that he actually sings it, a cappella, beautifully. </p> <p>Bearing in mind that Barlow is held as a founding father of scratchy, lo-fi guitar pop, it was a surprise to see him tinkering with bass-heavy backing tracks for the multi-layered songs from the Folk Implosion's latest album, One Part Lullaby. They weren't necessary; his simple guitar and cutting reflections on the selfishness, hurt and excitement of relationships are equally affecting unadorned - but he made an impressive job of precisely melding live and taped music without sounding slick. When he pushed away his guitar for My Ritual and began an avuncular shimmy so he could experience how it feels when bands perform on Top of the Pops without actually playing live, it was another delicious hint that he's not taking himself too seriously. </p> <p>This new light-heartedness made revisiting the old Barlow, the \"antique\" Sebadoh songs, yet more thrilling. He played songs no one could have expected to hear: the scrappy fragment Punch in the Nose, released when Sebadoh were called Sentridoh; Gimme Indie Rock, a thrashy index of the late-80s alternative music scene that sounded hilarious banged out on an acoustic guitar; an eerily gentle Really Insane. Admittedly, there was an element of \"He could fart and . . .\" but that just added to the sense that this was one of those evenings when you pop to a friend's house for a spot of tea and find yourself still there at four in the morning, gibbering and deliriously happy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When you have listened to someone's music for almost a decade, they weirdly but inevitably start to feel like an old friend. Hooking up again is a joyful, comforting experience, even if you haven't been in contact for a few months or years. An hour slips by catching up on the news and gauging the changes; then another, as shared memories resurface and favourite stories are uproariously, wistfully retold. Lou Barlow's one-off gig - an exhausting yet exhilarating 35-odd song set ostensibly designed to promote the Folk Implosion albums but stretching to accommodate the Sebadoh back-catalogue - had exactly that structure, that heart-warming quality. The changes were startling: from being utterly incommunicative on stage, Barlow has transformed into the kind of affable, engaging performer who part- jokingly, part-lovingly asks: \"How else can I serenade you, my fair audience?\" and is then so unfazed by one prankster's ridiculous request for the Stone Roses' I Wanna Be Adored that he actually sings it, a cappella, beautifully. Bearing in mind that Barlow is held as a founding father of scratchy, lo-fi guitar pop, it was a surprise to see him tinkering with bass-heavy backing tracks for the multi-layered songs from the Folk Implosion's latest album, One Part Lullaby. They weren't necessary; his simple guitar and cutting reflections on the selfishness, hurt and excitement of relationships are equally affecting unadorned - but he made an impressive job of precisely melding live and taped music without sounding slick. When he pushed away his guitar for My Ritual and began an avuncular shimmy so he could experience how it feels when bands perform on Top of the Pops without actually playing live, it was another delicious hint that he's not taking himself too seriously. This new light-heartedness made revisiting the old Barlow, the \"antique\" Sebadoh songs, yet more thrilling. He played songs no one could have expected to hear: the scrappy fragment Punch in the Nose, released when Sebadoh were called Sentridoh; Gimme Indie Rock, a thrashy index of the late-80s alternative music scene that sounded hilarious banged out on an acoustic guitar; an eerily gentle Really Insane. Admittedly, there was an element of \"He could fart and . . .\" but that just added to the sense that this was one of those evenings when you pop to a friend's house for a spot of tea and find yourself still there at four in the morning, gibbering and deliriously happy.",

Well, what else could they do? </p> <p>Quite a lot in fact. To be sure, it would be appalling if the inquiry limped along toothlessly and secretively before looking for a chance to fob off the mountains of cynical doubts and rumours. </p> <p>Lord Griffiths, already chairman of the ICC's code of conduct committee, must play a blinder here as he has never remotely been seen to do before. Procrastination of the sort that he and his dozy ICC peers have been used to would have a brutally ruinous effect on a game already riddled with self-doubt and lack of leadership. </p> <p>When, as well, is Lord MacLaurin actually going to show what he's made of? There is more to leadership than pronouncing sombre sentences to Radio 5 Live presenters. </p> <p>One's confidence in this new committee of inquiry in sorting out the criminals - or even distancing cricket from them - took a dive with yesterday's further announcement that everyone concerned will be asked to sign a statement of integrity promising he is \"clean\". </p> <p>Here's a piece of paper asking \"Are you a crook?\" Tick box \"yes\" or \"no\". </p> <p>\"No? Good boy. That's all right then.\" </p> <p>Or: \"Hansie, just put a tick in either of the boxes. No? Fine, you can captain South Africa this morning.\" </p> <p>Such a bizarre and naive proposal makes one wonder if the 18 men around the table yesterday knew exactly why they had been summoned to sit there in the first place. Well, cricket is obviously a very honest game - see, we've got a host of signatures to prove it. </p> <p>There was no announcement of any immediate reform of the one-day international fixture lists. A radical culling of all those worthless one-dayers, mostly played on the subcontinent, would have been my first act. In these corruption is a cinch - they are so meaningless and ubiquitous that nobody, even the morning after, can say who won or lost, or could care less.

      "bodyText": "Power inside the International Cricket Council may have been rudely wrested from the fuddy dominion's base at Lord's, but yesterday it at least managed a traditional British answer to a thorny problem - set up a committee to report back in the fullness of time. Tell you what, no betting man would have got odds from his bookmaker on the ICC not setting up a committee of investigation. Well, what else could they do? Quite a lot in fact. To be sure, it would be appalling if the inquiry limped along toothlessly and secretively before looking for a chance to fob off the mountains of cynical doubts and rumours. Lord Griffiths, already chairman of the ICC's code of conduct committee, must play a blinder here as he has never remotely been seen to do before. Procrastination of the sort that he and his dozy ICC peers have been used to would have a brutally ruinous effect on a game already riddled with self-doubt and lack of leadership. When, as well, is Lord MacLaurin actually going to show what he's made of? There is more to leadership than pronouncing sombre sentences to Radio 5 Live presenters. One's confidence in this new committee of inquiry in sorting out the criminals - or even distancing cricket from them - took a dive with yesterday's further announcement that everyone concerned will be asked to sign a statement of integrity promising he is \"clean\". Here's a piece of paper asking \"Are you a crook?\" Tick box \"yes\" or \"no\". \"No? Good boy. That's all right then.\" Or: \"Hansie, just put a tick in either of the boxes. No? Fine, you can captain South Africa this morning.\" Such a bizarre and naive proposal makes one wonder if the 18 men around the table yesterday knew exactly why they had been summoned to sit there in the first place. Well, cricket is obviously a very honest game - see, we've got a host of signatures to prove it. There was no announcement of any immediate reform of the one-day international fixture lists. A radical culling of all those worthless one-dayers, mostly played on the subcontinent, would have been my first act. In these corruption is a cinch - they are so meaningless and ubiquitous that nobody, even the morning after, can say who won or lost, or could care less. The players have no remote pride in playing them, and are careless about scoring a duck or a century. Had yesterday's meeting come clean and admitted it, and announced a universal ongoing one-day world championship played for international kudos and prize money, the grubby barrage of meaningless fixtures would vanish like a shot. Is this the sort of thing Lord Griffiths has been charged to provide? I doubt it somehow. The ICC's outgoing president Jagmohan Dalmiya will probably see yesterday as a triumph for negotiation and diplomacy. His three-year stewardship has been a disaster. High moral leadership, so desperately needed, has been non-existent. Dalmiya seems to have survived seemingly wild allegations that he took kickbacks from television rights with ease, but he cannot escape the sober charge of complicity in the fatuous devaluation of cricket as a whole. You desperately yearn for the days only a decade ago when the ICC was an almost unheard of adjunct of dear old MCC and its buffers at St John's Wood, who would hold amiable meetings over a couple of pink gins about the value of leg-byes or tinkering with the lbw law to allow leg-spinners a chance. Dalmiya burst that all asunder when he saw his chance after the 1996 World Cup bidding had been put in the bag for England - when the chairman Colin Cowdrey languidly allowed South Africa to put in a bid simply to show their future intent. Dalmiya pounced - \"what about us?\" - and the 1996 tournament went east. Doubtless to the joy of its bookmakers. The game - and for sure the certainty of its morals and ethics and innate goodness - has never been the same since. And yesterday seems to have done very little to alter that appalling indictment.",

One leak alleges that the report recommends life bans for Salim Malik, since retired, and Mushtaq Ahmed, but all will be revealed in five weeks' time when it will be handed over to the ICC. The ICC investigation will also monitor closely the judicial inquiry into Cronjegate which is to begin in South Africa soon and those that have been or are being held in India, England and Australia. The name of the man to lead the South Africa inquiry is expected today or tomorrow. The idea of an amnesty was always fanciful but might have offered a way out for potential whistle-blowers. However, it was deemed unworkable not least for legal reasons. \"We could not put ourselves in a position where we were offering amnesty to people who had committed criminal offences. That is not within our jurisdiction,\" said the ICC chief executive David Richards. Chris Lewis, whose revelations to a Sunday newspaper contributed to the match-fixing debate, said: \"I haven't studied the full statement, but if the ICC is talking about life bans and long-term bans, then it is a definite beginning. They are showing people around the world that this won't be tolerated. All of us earn a living in cricket and if the game gets tarnished we are in the mire.\"",

As before, a win earns 12 points, a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12pts, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>FOOTBALL'S MR LOADED</strong></p> <p>Cast your minds back to February 1998, when Mark Hughes was still a Premiership player and Nicolas Anelka nothing but a surly teenager. In this cold and vicious month, a man stood outside Villa Park with nothing but a slicked back haircut, a sweater tucked into his trousers and a dream. This man was John Gregory, and his dream was to manage Aston Villa. Which was fortunate.</p> <p>What a difference a couple of years and a few months make. Today, Football's Mr Longevity is one of the most respected (or maybe loudest) managers in the Premiership. So respected (loud) in fact, that he's just been awarded a new three-year contract by the most demanding chairman around - Demanding Doug Ellis. Gregory's deal is said to be worth \u00a31m-a-year, a just reward for a spell that has seen Gregory buy Steve Stone, throw away a top-five finish, and spend more time in the stands than a copy of Heat magazine.</p> <p>Speaking from the top of a chariot while Julian Joachim whispered in his ear to remind him of his mortality, Gregory said: \"The Villa board have shown their faith in me. I am a much better manager now than the guy they gambled on just over two years ago.\" And presumably better than the manager who nearly got the sack in December. Not that Gregory is looking back though. \"We have made progress over the last two years and the challenge is to build on that,\" he said. Shouldn't be too difficult.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>SIGN UP NOW, GET IT LATER</strong></p> <p>The Euro isn't just something which sends market traders into an apoplectic rage. It's also the Fiver's special Euro 2000 sibling. Brought to you in association with Breathe, the Euro will keep you up to date with everything that goes on in the lowlands this summer. To subscribe, send a mail to <a href=\"mailto:euro2000-request@footballunlimited.co.uk\">euro2000-request@footballunlimited.co.uk</a> with 'subscribe' in the subject line.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>KNEE KNACK CROCK SHOCK</strong></p> <p>We just knew this would happen. Last week, Manchester United's attempt to snatch Greg van Rusedski from under the noses of Arsenal failed when the lumbering Dutch lummox fell over and knacked his knee. So when Tottenham closed in on Arsenal target Sergei Rebrov yesterday, it was just a matter of time before the Ukrainian striker admitted he has \"a serious defect\" in the very same joint. And sure enough... we're not saying anything, but if you've spotted a wild-eyed Arsene Wenger whooping maniacally while triumphantly lifting a rented endoscope over his head, get in touch with your local bobby at once.</p> <p>Tottenham's \u00a311m headache began today when Rebrov spilled the beans of his injury hell all over a Moscow newspaper. \"Several years ago doctors discovered a serious defect - the jamming of cartilage in the knee joint - which from time to time gave me wild pain,\" he explained, safe in the knowledge that he was roughly 1,559 miles away from George Graham and his rising temper. \"I needed surgery... ever since then I pray to God that this was the end of it, and there will be no recurrence,\" continued the worried (but thankfully not bawled out) player.</p> <p>Rebrov's revelation may explain why Rangers quickly dropped plans to sign him a couple of months ago when \"something\" came to chairman David Murray's attention \"at a very late stage\". But Rebrov denies this was the reason his Ibrox move fell through - \"there was a problem with the transfer\". So is there a serious problem or not? We'll just have to wait a while and see - unless Arsene manages to make the meet with Kneecaps Keith McHat, in which case it'll be all over later tonight.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Egil Olsen was a brain surgeon trying to work with peasants. He thought these people were top professionals. God, did he get it wrong\" - Ex-Wimbledon midfielder Stalle Solbakken breaking a pledge not to criticise his former club. At least he did it in style.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>A WORD WITH CLIFFORD</strong></p> <p>David Trezeguet is one of the most sought-after strikers in world football. He's a current French international and expected to partner Thierry Henry during Euro 2000. At 22 years old he is prime, and clubs like AC Milan and Manchester United are said to covet him like a Frenchman covets a particularly fine clove of garlic. All of which makes it highly unlikely that Fulham would have any chance of signing him. But that's exactly what the plucky little club are trying to do. Hurrah!</p> <p>Surely such an audacious move can't succeed. But in a world where bad means good, right can sometimes mean wrong, and Sergei Rebrov admits he actually wants to move to Spurs, can anything be disregarded out of hand? Our Juliet-Bravo-style investigations are initially promising. Trezeguet began his career under Jean Tigana and is said to have \"huge respect\" for him. Furthermore, Trezeguet is a known rap fan, and would no-doubt welcome the chance to freestyle on the decks with \"I am Mohammed and you are Ali\" Al-Fayed.</p> <p>A phone call to Fulham's PR guru Max Clifford gets us even more giddy: \"Obviously we are hoping it'll be the first of many that Jean will be able to bring in,\" he tells us, and Trezza's move to John Craven Cottage seems all but secure. Then he corrects himself: \"Well actually I'd love it to be true, but it's the first I've heard of it.\" But, don't despair, Fulham fans, Max has promised he'll be onto the blower as soon as he hears anything.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>MANAGE YOUR TIME WITH JOHAN CRUYFF</strong></p> <p>Would Johan Cruyff rather watch the Premiership or Serie A?

      "bodyText": "FOOTBALL'S MR LOADED Cast your minds back to February 1998, when Mark Hughes was still a Premiership player and Nicolas Anelka nothing but a surly teenager. In this cold and vicious month, a man stood outside Villa Park with nothing but a slicked back haircut, a sweater tucked into his trousers and a dream. This man was John Gregory, and his dream was to manage Aston Villa. Which was fortunate. What a difference a couple of years and a few months make. Today, Football's Mr Longevity is one of the most respected (or maybe loudest) managers in the Premiership. So respected (loud) in fact, that he's just been awarded a new three-year contract by the most demanding chairman around - Demanding Doug Ellis. Gregory's deal is said to be worth \u00a31m-a-year, a just reward for a spell that has seen Gregory buy Steve Stone, throw away a top-five finish, and spend more time in the stands than a copy of Heat magazine. Speaking from the top of a chariot while Julian Joachim whispered in his ear to remind him of his mortality, Gregory said: \"The Villa board have shown their faith in me. I am a much better manager now than the guy they gambled on just over two years ago.\" And presumably better than the manager who nearly got the sack in December. Not that Gregory is looking back though. \"We have made progress over the last two years and the challenge is to build on that,\" he said. Shouldn't be too difficult. * * * * * * * * * * * * * SIGN UP NOW, GET IT LATER The Euro isn't just something which sends market traders into an apoplectic rage.

Last week, Manchester United's attempt to snatch Greg van Rusedski from under the noses of Arsenal failed when the lumbering Dutch lummox fell over and knacked his knee. So when Tottenham closed in on Arsenal target Sergei Rebrov yesterday, it was just a matter of time before the Ukrainian striker admitted he has \"a serious defect\" in the very same joint. And sure enough... we're not saying anything, but if you've spotted a wild-eyed Arsene Wenger whooping maniacally while triumphantly lifting a rented endoscope over his head, get in touch with your local bobby at once. Tottenham's \u00a311m headache began today when Rebrov spilled the beans of his injury hell all over a Moscow newspaper. \"Several years ago doctors discovered a serious defect - the jamming of cartilage in the knee joint - which from time to time gave me wild pain,\" he explained, safe in the knowledge that he was roughly 1,559 miles away from George Graham and his rising temper. \"I needed surgery... ever since then I pray to God that this was the end of it, and there will be no recurrence,\" continued the worried (but thankfully not bawled out) player. Rebrov's revelation may explain why Rangers quickly dropped plans to sign him a couple of months ago when \"something\" came to chairman David Murray's attention \"at a very late stage\". But Rebrov denies this was the reason his Ibrox move fell through - \"there was a problem with the transfer\". So is there a serious problem or not? We'll just have to wait a while and see - unless Arsene manages to make the meet with Kneecaps Keith McHat, in which case it'll be all over later tonight. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Egil Olsen was a brain surgeon trying to work with peasants. He thought these people were top professionals. God, did he get it wrong\" - Ex-Wimbledon midfielder Stalle Solbakken breaking a pledge not to criticise his former club. At least he did it in style. * * * * * * * * * * * * * A WORD WITH CLIFFORD David Trezeguet is one of the most sought-after strikers in world football. He's a current French international and expected to partner Thierry Henry during Euro 2000. At 22 years old he is prime, and clubs like AC Milan and Manchester United are said to covet him like a Frenchman covets a particularly fine clove of garlic. All of which makes it highly unlikely that Fulham would have any chance of signing him. But that's exactly what the plucky little club are trying to do. Hurrah! Surely such an audacious move can't succeed. But in a world where bad means good, right can sometimes mean wrong, and Sergei Rebrov admits he actually wants to move to Spurs, can anything be disregarded out of hand? Our Juliet-Bravo-style investigations are initially promising. Trezeguet began his career under Jean Tigana and is said to have \"huge respect\" for him. Furthermore, Trezeguet is a known rap fan, and would no-doubt welcome the chance to freestyle on the decks with \"I am Mohammed and you are Ali\" Al-Fayed. A phone call to Fulham's PR guru Max Clifford gets us even more giddy: \"Obviously we are hoping it'll be the first of many that Jean will be able to bring in,\" he tells us, and Trezza's move to John Craven Cottage seems all but secure. Then he corrects himself: \"Well actually I'd love it to be true, but it's the first I've heard of it.\" But, don't despair, Fulham fans, Max has promised he'll be onto the blower as soon as he hears anything. * * * * * * * * * * * * * MANAGE YOUR TIME WITH JOHAN CRUYFF Would Johan Cruyff rather watch the Premiership or Serie A?

      "bodyText": "Clear evidence existed showing that \"unreasonable restraint\" was used on a black remand prisoner who died in a privatised jail during a struggle with prison officers, the high court was told yesterday. Alton Manning, 33, from Birmingham, died as he was being carried away from a cell at Blakenhurst prison, Hereford and Worcester, on December 8 1995. The incident happened when Manning was asked to squat naked for a strip search in \"disputed circumstances\", said Nicholas Blake QC, appearing for Manning's family. They launched the high court challenge after David Calvert-Smith QC, the director of public prosecutions, decided not to prosecute any of the officers involved due to insufficient evidence. Yesterday's hearing was the first challenge to the DPP's new policy on when to mount a prosecution when there has been a death in custody. Manning's sisters, Patricia Manning and Elizabeth Melbourne, also from Birmingham, yesterday applied to Lord Bingham, the lord chief justice, sitting with Mr Justice Morison, for a judicial review following the refusal in 1996 of the DPP and crown prosecution service to bring manslaughter charges. At the start of yesterday's hearing Lord Bingham described the case as a \"matter of considerable public importance\". Mr Blake said: \"There was clear evidence of restraint that was unreasonable and therefore unlawful being applied. He added: \"In cases where the state has a responsibility for investigating its own officers, the crown prosecution service has an obligation to either prosecute or explain why it is not going to prosecute.\" He told the court there was a violent struggle involving six or seven prison officers and there was evidence from prisoners that one of the officers was holding Manning in a neck lock at the time he met his death from asphyxia at the prison run by the US-owned UK Detention Services. Despite the DPP's decision in September 1996 not to prosecute any prison officers, an inquest jury returned a verdict that Manning had been unlawfully killed, after a three-week hearing at Kidderminster coroner's court, Hereford and Worcester, in March 1998. Mr Blake said this \"rational and lawful\" verdict and the finding that the death was caused by asphyxia as a result of the neck hold resulted in the decision not to prosecute being reviewed. He added: \"A review note now suggests the prosecution was satisfied there was a prima facie case of unlawful act manslaughter against unit manager David Nicholson, the officer who had the responsibility for the head of Mr Manning when he was being restrained in circumstances when he was ordered to be strip searched.\" Two other officers had gone to ground floor cell 26 on C wing of house block three to do a routine search of Manning, and he was taken to cell 35 for a strip search. An altercation started when he was asked to squat naked for an inspection of his genital and anal area. It was alleged that an assault by Manning on senior prison custody officer Peter Reynolds led to the alarm being sounded by prison custody officer David Brumby, and other officers coming into the cell. Manning was then taken out of the cell headfirst and carried semi naked along a corridor towards the dining area, with Mr Nicholson at the head. It was Mr Nicholson's claim that he was using an approved lock, said Mr Blake. But the evidence was that Manning had been unable to breathe by the time he was carried to the dining area. All efforts to revive him failed. He was found to be bleeding from his ear and throat, but according to pathologists, this was consistent with pressure being applied to the neck, said Mr Blake. He added that although it was now accepted there was a prima facie case of unlawful act manslaughter against Mr Nicholson, it was being suggested the death was the result of an accident, or an act of self-defence, justifying the use of force and the arm on the neck and there was \"no realistic prospect of securing a conviction\". Mr Blake said in the light of all the evidence and the inquest jury's unlawful killing verdict, the latest DPP decision not to prosecute in February 1999 and reaffirmed that April, was manifestly perverse and irrational. Failure to prosecute over three deaths in police custody prompted damning criticism of the last DPP, Dame Barbara Mills QC, who resigned before the end of her term of office. The three deaths in custody prompted an inquiry under the retired judge, Gerald Butler QC, which led to an overhaul of procedures that required prosecution decisions in such cases to be referred to the attorney general. The hearing continues.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Lorna Boothe was 11 years old when she joined her local athletics club 30 years ago. She was one of two black athletes at the club and she always had problems getting into the teams, even when she was the fastest - but it only made her more determined to be the best so they had to select her.</p> <p>Then, aged 18, she remembers having a row about who was running where in the relay. The coach yelled: \"You black bitch! Why don't you get back where you came from?\" She was so furious she beat the record for the 400m hurdles in her next race, then changed club. Boothe went on to win international medals for Britain between 1975 and 1984; and, when her competing career was over, she rose through the ranks of athletics administration to become the most senior black woman in athletics management.</p> <p>Hers looked like a runaway success story. Then, in March, it emerged that Boothe, 45, was pursuing a claim for race and sex discrimination against UK Athletics, the sport's governing body, which appointed her Britain's athletics team manager for the Sydney Olympics. She was hoping to spill the beans on the \"white male world of British athletics\": after recent changes to the structure of the governing body, she claims her role as team manager has been diminished and she has been sidelined, a charge denied by UK Athletics. But her case was never heard because of a legal clause which disqualifies people who work regularly overseas. UK Athletics was accused of \"wriggling out\" of a proper hearing. Boothe and her lawyers are now lobbying for a change in the law, with the support of the Commission for Racial Equality.</p> <p>This comes at a tricky time for UK Athletics. In a few months, British athletes will make their way to the Sydney Olympics. For most, an Olympic medal is the ultimate prize in a career - the contest only comes round once every four years; the majority of competitors will have only one or two chances for Olympic glory in their career. Few outside the sport can understand the sort of gargantuan effort that goes into preparations for such a competition.</p> <p>Ashia Hansen is one of those gifted few chasing the Olympic dream. A world record-holding triple jumper, she is one of Britain's best hopes for a gold. In March, however, Hansen and her boyfriend, Chris Cotter, both 28, found themselves the targets of a terrifying race hate campaign which could have killed Cotter and was designed to strike fear in the heart of Hansen and every other black athlete hoping to make it to Sydney.</p> <p>It was late one Tuesday evening. Cotter was due to meet Ashia Hansen at her Birmingham house. Hansen was due to fly to the US for warm-weather training, and Cotter was to have dinner at her house that night. Shortly before 10.30pm, he was making his way to her front door when a man - 6ft 5in with a nasty line in racist abuse - accosted him. He grabbed Cotter's arm and marched him towards Hansen's house, whispering horrible, racist things about Hansen. He wanted to get into the house.</p> <p>Cotter tried to back off but other men joined in the attack. They swore at him, calling him a nigger-lover. He felt punches to his back, then before they ran off, the big man who first grabbed him slashed Cotter across the forehead. \"We warned you not to mix with niggers,\" one of the gang hissed.</p> <p>They drove off, leaving Cotter with three stab wounds to the back and blood pouring from his head. He lost four pints of blood. The next morning Hansen found a letter in her porch, composed of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines. \"You were lucky last time,\" it said. \"We won't make the same mistake again.\"</p> <p>The incident sent a shiver of fear, anger and revulsion through the world of international athletics, and beyond. Then the racists followed their attack on Cotter with a series of racist hate letters. So far, three high profile black athletes have received them. Others may find them on their doormat when they return from training abroad. The message? We don't want your kind representing Britain in the Olympics.</p> <p>The police are carrying out forensic tests on the letters; other mail sent to leading athletes c/o UK Olympics (until now it has all been forwarded to those named on the envelope and regarded as fan mail) is being screened, and all leading athletes have been warned to be vigilant.</p> <p>It's not the first time such attacks have happened against high profile black sportspeople, particularly those in mixed marriages. Sharron Davies, Olympic swimmer-turned-TV star, and her former husband, retired athlete Derek Redmond, were targeted by the extreme right group Combat 18; four years ago police intercepted a parcel bomb addressed to their house. Earlier this month, a new, neo-nazi CD surfaced in which more threats are made against Davies.</p> <p>Talk to people within the sport and what emerges is not only widespread horror at the racist attacks launched on athletes from outside athletics, but also a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction about what's going on inside the sport. It's one thing to be attacked and abused by racist thugs; it's another to feel that your own organisation is discriminating against you.</p> <p>The trials which decide who goes to the Olympics are to be held in Birmingham in August amid tight security. The chief concern is that, while nearly half of British team is likely to be black, the management, selection, coaching and administration of athletics is still predominantly white. Black competitors may have proved themselves on the track and field but they still aren't making the transition to other areas of the sport, unlike their white counterparts. \"At the end of the day in this country,\" says one leading black figure in athletics, \"it's jobs for the boys, and I ain't part of that boys' system. I'm not the right colour.\"</p> <p>Boothe is one of the few successful black athletes who would appear to have made that transition successfully: \"The response to what happened to Ashia has been [a feeling that] these thugs have brought racism into our sport. But it's been there for a long time. I've had racism all the time. I certainly suffered it as a youngster. If you look at how many black administrators there are at top level, how many managers, how many coaches - what barriers are keeping us back? We've got no black officials. It's like a clique, white and mainly male. They say there's no racism, there are lots of black competitors.\"</p> <p>Keith Connor, another successful British Olympic athlete, would have liked to coach in Britain, but when he found there was nothing for him, he looked elsewhere. He now works in Australia and watches with disbelief the way British black talent is being wasted. He says many of Britain's leading black athletes who retire and become top personal coaches - producing winning performances from others - are still being overlooked by the athletics establishment for work with the national team. \"I don't think anything has improved,\" he says. \"If anything, it's more depressing because the new regime in charge of athletics should know better. It's not as if they've not been around black people. I hear some of these guys talking about athletes in track and field as if they've just come out of the trees.\"</p> <p>Last month it also emerged - outside the narrow confines of the world of athletics - that Geoff Thompson, five times former world karate champion and one of Britain's leading black sports figures, is considering taking a job in South Africa, feeling he has been marginalised and denied opportunities in the world of sports administration in this country. The problem is clearly widespread.</p> <p>Max Jones, performance director of UK Athletics, rejects any suggestion of discrimination in his sport, however. He puts the lack of black coaches, managers and administrators down to a generational gap. In 1969, for example, there were just two black members of the British team who took part in the European championships, he says. A number of the athletes in that squad, once retired, went on to work in different areas of the sport - including David Hemery who is now president of UK Athletics. But there weren't enough black athletes at that stage to have made a significant mark in the running of the sport. Black athletes, according to Jones, only began to come through in the late 70s and 80s.</p> <p>\"I think we've seen encouraging signs,\" he says. \"Over the past 10 to 15 years, there's been a huge increase in the number of black coaches. In each of the major games recently there's been a black coach. I reject any suggestion of discrimination. It is an issue we should look at, and encourage black athletes to participate in the sport after they've retired. We are setting up high performance centres across the country using lottery funding, and are looking at ways of fast-tracking today's athletes into coaching and administration. We are looking for black coaches and administrators to take part in teams. But I can only take eight coaches to the Olympics.\"</p> <p>Of the eight team coaches already selected for Sydney, one is black; of the five managers, two are black; and the rest of the 22-strong support squad - medical staff, physiotherapists, sports psychologists - are likely to be white. Selection panels are exclusively white (Boothe and another manager were removed in a reorganisation) but Jones says he doesn't believe that's a problem as selection is purely performance-based. Of a six or seven strong panel that is responsible for picking both male and female teams, there is just one woman.</p> <p>So how does all this fit in with Ashia Hansen and Chris Cotter? Does it fit in at all? \"Lorna's case raises very serious questions about what is happening at the top of one of the most integrated sports,\" says Courtney Hay of the Northern Complainants Aid Fund which has backed her case along with the CRE. \"She's the most senior woman in athletics in this country, and the most senior black person. She's making very serious allegations. They need to be investigated. If they are committed to race equality, they should be taking her concerns seriously.\"</p> <p>Senior figures in athletics point to the racial equality charter for sport signed by seven national governing bodies, including athletics, as evidence of their commitment to equality. Other moves include research into low participation by Asians in the sport, scholarships to attract more black coaches, and the appointment of black tutors to bring more ethnic groups into administration and coaching. But the impact of such moves is yet to filter through to many, such as this black former athlete who says of racism in athletics: \"It's a taboo. It's not seen as an issue. It's touched on around the edges, but they don't want to go to the heart of it. We need to slap a few people and say wake up.\"</p> <p>Athletics may have woken up to racism from outside - the sort that sees a white man stabbed for going out with a black woman. Whether it is fully aware of the sort of discrimination that allows it to trade on the competitive success of its black members then deny them top jobs in running the sport remains to be seen. Boothe is determined to see change. She is one of the few who has made it to the top. She plans to be there at the Olympics with Ashia Hansen and all the other athletes, black and white. \"I'm there to do a job. I'm not going to be pushed. I'm there till Sydney.\"</p>",

It's touched on around the edges, but they don't want to go to the heart of it. We need to slap a few people and say wake up.\" Athletics may have woken up to racism from outside - the sort that sees a white man stabbed for going out with a black woman. Whether it is fully aware of the sort of discrimination that allows it to trade on the competitive success of its black members then deny them top jobs in running the sport remains to be seen. Boothe is determined to see change. She is one of the few who has made it to the top. She plans to be there at the Olympics with Ashia Hansen and all the other athletes, black and white. \"I'm there to do a job. I'm not going to be pushed. I'm there till Sydney.\"",

Mrs Bell said: \"Everything was burning, the driveway, the lawn, the hedges, the rooftops.\" She said she and her brother later went into the street and had to jump over small \"campfires\" everywhere.

Zimbabwe's 12 for that Test also included Guy and Andy Whittall, who are cousins, but Andy was made 12th man. The various Flowers and Strangs have all played in the same Test 12 times now. Other occasions when two pairs of brothers have been in the same Test side were in 1913-14 (Herbie and Dan Taylor and Philip and Reginald Hands for South Africa), 1933-34 (CK and CS Nayudu and Nazir and Wazir Ali for India), 1963-64 (Peter and Graeme Pollock and David and Tony Pithey for South Africa) and 1976-77 (Geoff and Hedley Howarth and Dayle and Richard Hadlee for New Zealand).

First he hurt his arm just before last year's World Cup, then when he tried a comeback in Zimbabwe recently he injured his knee, and announced that he wouldn't be fit to tour England - a blow for Zimbabwe, because he would have brought much-needed experience after his two useful county seasons with Kent and Nottinghamshire. It's not all bad news for the Strang family, though: brother Bryan recently returned to the national side, and he is part of the squad in England. Cricinfo recently carried an interesting interview with Paul Strang - you can find it <a href=\"http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/CRICKET_NEWS/2000/MAR/025  090_ZCO_09MAR2000.html\">here</a></p> <p> <strong> I am researching my family tree and have discovered that Wilfrid Timms, who played for Northamptonshire in the 1920s, was my grandfather's cousin. Do you have any more information about him?</strong> asks Kate Prinsep </p> <p>Wilfrid Walter Timms played 99 matches for Northants between 1921 and 1932, scoring 4083 runs at 22.55. He was still at Northampton School when he first played for them, and scored an amazing 154 not out in only his second match, against Essex at Northampton, after which he was chaired from the field by his schoolmates. Later that season he found himself captaining Northants even though he was still a schoolboy - he was the only amateur available to play, and it was traditional in those days that an amateur should lead the side. Timms died on Sept 30, 1986, two days after his 84th birthday. A long article on him appeared in the February 1986 edition of Wisden Cricket Monthly, and his obituary appeared in that year's November issue. </p> <p> <strong> I was looking at the list of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Century and noticed that Godfrey Evans and Geoff Boycott were not styled as 'Sir'.

England haven't had their hands on it since 1969, when Ray Illingworth's side won a short series 2-0. The trophy was instituted in 1963 to mark the 100th edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, first published in 1864. As yet there isn't a special trophy for England-Zimbabwe Tests, although Cornhill Insurance, the sponsors, will probably be providing a cup of their own.</p> <p> <strong> What is the most picturesque Test ground, and what is the smallest international venue in the world? </strong> asks Dhanush from Sri Lanka </p> <p>It's arguable. Adelaide, in Australia, has its admirers, but I think the ground at St Vincent, in the West Indies, is probably the most picturesque. It is on a fairly small island and the ground is right next to the sea. Some of the other grounds in West Indies aren't very big, but the smallest one I've actually been to is Queen's Club in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe - apart from a few seats in front of the pavilion, and one bit of grass terracing, there is very little permanent seating.

In total, 20m people out of a 43m-strong electorate in Britain are eligible to vote today.</p> <p>However, voters trickled to the polls in London, suggesting the final turnout might be less than a third. In Streatham, south London, 85 people made it to the polling booths in the first three hours.</p> <p>Independent candidate Ken Livingstone attacked the \"vile\" campaign against him as he cast his vote in Cricklewood, north London. \"It has been a negative campaign and I don't think Londoners will want another like this,\" he said. He added that the vote would be much closer than opinion polls suggested and predicted it would run into a count of second preferences.</p> <p>The capital's first directly elected mayor will be decided with a supplementary vote system in which each voter is entitled to mark their first and second choice candidates on the ballot paper. If one candidate wins more than 50% of the first preferences he or she is declared the winner.</p> <p>If no candidate gets half the vote all but the top two are eliminated and the second choice votes of those who opted for the eliminated candidates are taken into account. Whichever of the two remaining candidates has more votes is declared the winner. The result is expected early tomorrow morning.</p> <p>Conservative candidate Steve Norris said that Mr Livingstone's bubble had burst as he stepped out of his Jaguar to vote in Clapham, south London. \"Londoners are voting today for action over politics. They want a safer, cleaner, fairer London,\" he said.</p> <p>And Labour's Frank Dobson attracted a last minute supporter as he cast his vote in Drury Lane, central London.

      "bodyText": "Voting is under way in what is likely to be the most important register of public opinion until the next general election. Polls for 152 local authorities across England, the Romsey byelection and the London mayoral contest will provide a snapshot of local opinion and an indication of the fortunes of Tony Blair's government three years after it won power. Londoners also have the chance to elect the first members of the Greater London Assembly. In total, 20m people out of a 43m-strong electorate in Britain are eligible to vote today. However, voters trickled to the polls in London, suggesting the final turnout might be less than a third. In Streatham, south London, 85 people made it to the polling booths in the first three hours. Independent candidate Ken Livingstone attacked the \"vile\" campaign against him as he cast his vote in Cricklewood, north London. \"It has been a negative campaign and I don't think Londoners will want another like this,\" he said. He added that the vote would be much closer than opinion polls suggested and predicted it would run into a count of second preferences. The capital's first directly elected mayor will be decided with a supplementary vote system in which each voter is entitled to mark their first and second choice candidates on the ballot paper. If one candidate wins more than 50% of the first preferences he or she is declared the winner. If no candidate gets half the vote all but the top two are eliminated and the second choice votes of those who opted for the eliminated candidates are taken into account. Whichever of the two remaining candidates has more votes is declared the winner. The result is expected early tomorrow morning. Conservative candidate Steve Norris said that Mr Livingstone's bubble had burst as he stepped out of his Jaguar to vote in Clapham, south London. \"Londoners are voting today for action over politics. They want a safer, cleaner, fairer London,\" he said. And Labour's Frank Dobson attracted a last minute supporter as he cast his vote in Drury Lane, central London. A 45-year-old environmental activist from Totnes, Devon ran after his car with a placard reading \"Dobbo for the Jobbo\". \"He's got a nice hairy beard, and he's furry like me, that's why I am supporting him,\" he said. Outside London, polling stations are open for the Romsey byelection precipitated by the death of the Conservative MP Michael Colvin in a fire at his home. In the local elections 3,000 seats are being contested by 9,000 candidates. These seats were last up for election in 1996 when the then Conservative government suffered a crushing defeat. Polls close in all elections at 9pm. London mayor candidates Geoffrey Ben-Nathan, pro-motorist and small shop Geoffrey Clements, Natural Law party Frank Dobson, Labour Ram Gidoomal, Christian People's Alliance Damian Hockney, UK Independence Party Darren Johnson, Green Susan Kramer, Liberal Democrat Ken Livingstone, independent Michael Newland, British National Party Steve Norris, Conservative Ashwin Tanna, independent Romsey byelection Sandra Gidley, Liberal Democrat Andrew Howard, Labour Thomas Lamont, independent Derrick Large, Legalise Cannabis Alliance Timothy Palmer, Conservative Garry Rankin-Moore, UK Independence party",

But while Charles lost his head by ignoring criticism, Nunn, less than halfway through his five-year term as head of the National Theatre, seems determined to hang on to his. </p> <p>One of the best post-war interpreters of Shakespeare and the man who brought us Les Mis\u00e9rables and Cats, Nunn was the safe choice to replace Richard Eyre. He had run the Royal Shakespeare Company for 18 years, opened the Donmar Warehouse and amassed a \u00a330m fortune in his \"spare time\" through projects in the West End and on Broadway. But almost as soon as he was installed, Nunn was accused of being too cautious and populist. Muttering began about whether he should be allowed a second term. </p> <p>It is only fair to admit that the Guardian's theatre critic, Michael Billington, thought his appointment a bad idea. He said so, as Nunn ruefully testifies: \"He heard a rumour that I would get it, and said it was a still worse idea when it became a reality.\" </p> <p>Nunn, 60, has strong views on his old sparring partner, dating back to Billington's attack on his eight-and-a- half-hour staging of Nicholas Nickleby in 1980, which, Nunn delights in explaining, was \"subsequently held up as one of the theatrical events of the decade\". Billington, however, insists he is not pursuing a vendetta, but simply reflecting widely held views in the theatre that the National is now being run as \"Trevor's club\". </p> <p>Nunn disputes this, but the National's stages have found little room for the younger generation of directors led by Stephen Daldry, Deborah Warner and Declan Donnellan. </p> <p>Last month in these pages Billington again laid into the Nunn regime, attacking what he perceived to be its blandness and reliance on musicals, describing his latest, The Villains' Opera, as \"dire\". Since the show was Nunn's baby, it hurt all the more. </p> <p>Nunn robustly defends The Villains' Opera as a perfectly valid vehicle for the National's award-winning ensemble, a company led by Simon Russell Beale and Henry Goodman that cleaned up at this year's Olivier theatre awards. \"Between 1999 and the end of 2000 there will have been 43 productions in our theatres, five of which will have contained music. </p> <p>\"Honk! [a musical for young people based on The Ugly Duckling, described by Billington as \"mediocre\"] was written by two youngish British writers, and beat Spend, Spend, Spend and even The Lion King to the best new musical of the year [Olivier] award. Yet critics write that it should never have been put on.\" </p> <p>Critics, Nunn says, have always tried to put him in a \"mainstream, populist box\" because he once worked for Andrew Lloyd Webber. \"I am totally unrepentant about doing Oklahoma. I think of it as one of the seminal works of the popular theatre of the 20th century. It was an epoch-forming work that changed the genre.\" </p> <p>He is also proud of bringing back an ensemble to the National \"after decades\" - without doubt the greatest achievement so far of his regime - and of squeezing more money from government. But he has clearly been stung by claims that he hasn't had an eye for new talent, and is adamant that playwrights are prospering under him. \"People forget that it was I who opened the Donmar as a home of new writing. I don't know if you remember Educating Rita?\" </p> <p>Last week three National productions opened in New York: Copenhagen, Our Lady of Sligo and Rose. \"We are keeping Broadway in new plays,\" he declares. \"If there really have been problems for three years, as they say, what about Closer, Amy's View and Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick, described only last week in the Guardian as one of the best plays of the 90s? Look at Joe Penhall's Blue/Orange, another new play, which has West End managements queueing up to transfer it. </p> <p>\"Of course there are a number of plays that occupy a middle position. Billington says our only policy is to do the worst play of any given author, but Nick Darke's The Riot proves that is not so. Don't go for the snapshot - you have to look at the broader picture.\" </p> <p>Nunn maintains he does not feel under siege and has had much praise from his peers. \"I would love to know how many directors of the first rank have attacked me. There will be aspirant directors and writers who are impatient - I understand that. But with an organisation of this complexity it takes a year just to learn what is going on. Things are changing now.\" </p> <p>He has doubled touring, to bring \"the National to the nation\", and believes the institution should also be a showcase for the best of regional theatre. \"I apologise that West Yorkshire Playhouse's Singing in the Rain [opening in the summer] is a musical. But this is what people got so excited about in Leeds, and which work do you think they want to bring to London? What should I say? 'Oh no, why don't you bring something that you're not so keen on?' </p> <p>\"The money that comes to us is from across the board. That is why the National has to be a theatre for everybody. Some of its work has got to be ground-breaking, but not all.\" </p> <p>Nunn nevertheless admits it is \"high time\" the National had the wherewithal to present plays developed at its own studio on its main stages, and hopes to bring three new works through shortly. But where are the big plays, like David Hare's trilogy (Racing Demon, Murmuring Judges and The Absence of War), which defined the upheavals of Thatcher's Britain? \"It's not so long ago that 'state of the nation' was a term of abuse,\" Nunn retorts. \"I have approached many writers on the subject of the big play, and its extraordinary how so many of them are saying, 'I want to go small'. It will come. The determination to commission work, receive work, find work and encourage work is unswerving.\" </p> <p>So is Nunn digging in for a second term? \"I am not going to have such words put into my mouth. There is never a point when you achieve all you want. However, it is vital that departure is connected with succession. I am interested in building genuine associate directorships with people who are broadly in agreement with the aims of this building. There is no sense in trying to create cohesion from a group of people who keep saying no to everything you try to do.\" </p> <p>It is clear, however, that Nunn wants to go on working with the National's \"fantastic family\" as long as he can. But with all that money in the bank, isn't it tempting to just opt for an easier life? \"I promise you this,\" he says with even greater gravitas than usual, \"I shall still be here when Billington [who is 60] has retired.\" And then, for the first time in an hour, he allows himself a grin.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Junk and disorderly</strong><br> We are all familiar with junk mail which is annoying enough, but worse when the addressee is a) someone you've never heard of or b) a long-dead relative. John Gill's lament from East Sussex gives an insight into how this happens. </p> <p>He runs a small mail-order company and uses addresses rented from list brokers for many of his mailshots. He recently rented 40,000 addresses, from one such broker, organised a mailshot, and has received nearly 3,000 of his catalogues back marked \"gone away\". Hundreds of those on the list had signed up with the mail preference service and should never have been contacted and several addressees had died years previously. The Direct Marketing Association (DMA), which governs the sale and use of data by its members, is, he claims, uninterested in taking up his complaint. \"The carelessness of the [data] industry runs from top to bottom,\" he says, \"and the consumer is rightly irritated by the mindless proliferation of junk.\" </p> <p> \u0095 The DMA insists that there are strict regulations to prevent such slip-ups. The Data Protection Act requires brokers to ensure information is up to date and the DMA's own code of practice insists householders' details are amended within 30 days of death or within 60 days of changing address. Each broker has to sign a warranty guaranteeing that its lists abide by the rules. \"We haven't had a case involving breached warranties before and will be investigating, even though the broker in this case isn't a member,\" says a spokeswoman.</p> <p><strong> Floored by Halifax</strong><br> Kevin Healy of Leeds sought help from Consumer last year w hen his mortgage lender, the Halifax, helped itself to payments for an insurance policy he had never requested. Consumer managed to effect a reconciliation; now the Halifax has slipped again. </p> <p>For 28 years Healy has paid his buildings insurance premiums as part of his mortgage arrangement and the policy has always been renewed automatically. Next year his mortgage will be paid off, so last year the Halifax explained that it had switched him to a new, more appropriate, policy. Several months later Healy found that a shower leak had damaged the walls and floorboards in his bathroom. Halifax, however, told him that whereas his previous policy had covered damage to floorboards, his new one did not. \"I feel that the company has promoted an inferior policy which substantially weakened our cover,\" he says. </p> <p>\u0095 Halifax admits that its service has been unacceptable. \"Our insurance policies are not designed to cater for damage resulting from wet or dry rot,\" says a spokeswoman. \"However, where the outbreak can be clearly linked to an insured event, consideration will be given to the cost of these repairs.\" Healy is to receive new flooring at Halifax's expense.</p> <p><strong> Plagued by gas</strong><br> Last week R Wallis of London took three days off work to wait in for British Gas engineers and on each occasion the appointment was broken without notice or apology. A dozen phone calls and several letters later she was promised a goodwill voucher which was never sent. British Gas failed to reply to most of the letters, but did manage to drop her a line demanding payment of her gas bill. </p> <p>\u0095 British Gas blames \"poor communications\" between departments and \"lack of attention\" on the part of its engineers. \"The appointments were broken in the depths of winter when we are under more pressure,\" says a spokeswoman. \"If an emergency arises our engineers get diverted to deal with it and they have a mobile to warn waiting customers of this. Maybe we didn't have Mrs Williams's number.\" The company has now agreed to pay her a sum to compensate for her wasted time and energy.</p> <p><strong> Straight to the top</strong><br> Liz Eburne and Mark Crudgington are rejoicing. After seven months, they have finally had their Cable&amp;Wireless telephone installed. \"We ordered it in September but the installation was constantly delayed. We've had to put up with abuse from staff and lack of response from customer services.\" </p> <p>Eburn and Crudgington hit on the bright idea of writing to the chief executive of C&amp;W and received a reply within two weeks. They were put through on a direct line to a helpful human being and even given a date for installation. Their advice to people who have suffered similarly? \"May we suggest other frustrated readers do the same as the results were refreshingly fast and it's a comfort to have a name to sort out future problems.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; email <a href=\"'mailto:consumer@theguardian.com'\"> consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Junk and disorderly We are all familiar with junk mail which is annoying enough, but worse when the addressee is a) someone you've never heard of or b) a long-dead relative. John Gill's lament from East Sussex gives an insight into how this happens. He runs a small mail-order company and uses addresses rented from list brokers for many of his mailshots. He recently rented 40,000 addresses, from one such broker, organised a mailshot, and has received nearly 3,000 of his catalogues back marked \"gone away\". Hundreds of those on the list had signed up with the mail preference service and should never have been contacted and several addressees had died years previously. The Direct Marketing Association (DMA), which governs the sale and use of data by its members, is, he claims, uninterested in taking up his complaint. \"The carelessness of the [data] industry runs from top to bottom,\" he says, \"and the consumer is rightly irritated by the mindless proliferation of junk.\" \u0095 The DMA insists that there are strict regulations to prevent such slip-ups. The Data Protection Act requires brokers to ensure information is up to date and the DMA's own code of practice insists householders' details are amended within 30 days of death or within 60 days of changing address. Each broker has to sign a warranty guaranteeing that its lists abide by the rules. \"We haven't had a case involving breached warranties before and will be investigating, even though the broker in this case isn't a member,\" says a spokeswoman. Floored by Halifax Kevin Healy of Leeds sought help from Consumer last year w hen his mortgage lender, the Halifax, helped itself to payments for an insurance policy he had never requested. Consumer managed to effect a reconciliation; now the Halifax has slipped again. For 28 years Healy has paid his buildings insurance premiums as part of his mortgage arrangement and the policy has always been renewed automatically. Next year his mortgage will be paid off, so last year the Halifax explained that it had switched him to a new, more appropriate, policy. Several months later Healy found that a shower leak had damaged the walls and floorboards in his bathroom. Halifax, however, told him that whereas his previous policy had covered damage to floorboards, his new one did not. \"I feel that the company has promoted an inferior policy which substantially weakened our cover,\" he says. \u0095 Halifax admits that its service has been unacceptable. \"Our insurance policies are not designed to cater for damage resulting from wet or dry rot,\" says a spokeswoman. \"However, where the outbreak can be clearly linked to an insured event, consideration will be given to the cost of these repairs.\" Healy is to receive new flooring at Halifax's expense. Plagued by gas Last week R Wallis of London took three days off work to wait in for British Gas engineers and on each occasion the appointment was broken without notice or apology. A dozen phone calls and several letters later she was promised a goodwill voucher which was never sent. British Gas failed to reply to most of the letters, but did manage to drop her a line demanding payment of her gas bill. \u0095 British Gas blames \"poor communications\" between departments and \"lack of attention\" on the part of its engineers. \"The appointments were broken in the depths of winter when we are under more pressure,\" says a spokeswoman. \"If an emergency arises our engineers get diverted to deal with it and they have a mobile to warn waiting customers of this. Maybe we didn't have Mrs Williams's number.\" The company has now agreed to pay her a sum to compensate for her wasted time and energy. Straight to the top Liz Eburne and Mark Crudgington are rejoicing. After seven months, they have finally had their Cable&amp;Wireless telephone installed. \"We ordered it in September but the installation was constantly delayed. We've had to put up with abuse from staff and lack of response from customer services.\" Eburn and Crudgington hit on the bright idea of writing to the chief executive of C&amp;W and received a reply within two weeks. They were put through on a direct line to a helpful human being and even given a date for installation. Their advice to people who have suffered similarly? \"May we suggest other frustrated readers do the same as the results were refreshingly fast and it's a comfort to have a name to sort out future problems.\" \u0095 Write to us at119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; email consumer@theguardian.com",

      "trailText": "<p>When Ridley Scott wanted to recreate the Colosseum for his film Gladiator he stayed well clear of Rome.  Rory Carroll asked the director why</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Antiquity's most famous arena, the Colosseum, still hulks over Rome. Millions of sightseers flock to it every year, sit on the same seats as the baying mobs of 2,000 years ago, wander the dungeons where wild beasts were caged, and lapse into an awed silence. Ridley Scott is struck by its majesty and scale every time he visits. </p> <p>In the 8th century AD, Bede wrote: \"While the Colosseum stands, Rome shall stand, but when the Colosseum falls, Rome shall fall - and when Rome falls, the world will end,\" </p> <p>Well, the Colosseum is still standing. And when Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio commissioned a \u00a3120m epic about gladiators, Scott's pulse quickened. No director in a generation had been offered the opportunity to recreate imperial Rome. It was not enough merely to evoke the Colosseum's atmosphere and scale. No other monument better embodies man's ingenuity and brutality, and the director of Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise wanted the set of a lifetime. Everything had to be viscerally real. The actors and audience had to see, hear and smell the arena. Scott went to Malta. </p> <p>The real Colosseum - all of Rome in fact - he left to the tourists. He preferred to build from scratch on an empty parade ground, using less bricks and mortar than Romulus and Remus on a slow day. The result? A triumph. Scott gallops the audience through a sprawling metropolis of winding streets, markets, temples, palaces, avenues and arches before depositing it, breathless, at the Colosseum. </p> <p>The camera climbs up its three tiers, tips over the retractable canvas roof then plunges into the 50,000 spectators screaming for blood. Seconds later it is swooping into the bowels, where pulleys hoist cages of gladiators to the surface. The grilles lift, the fighters sprint into the sunlit arena and the games begin. </p> <p>It is one of cinema's most ambitious, and successful, recreations of imperial Rome - achieved without setting foot in the city. For this, hail computer graphic imaging. British technicians built a fragment of the Colosseum's first tier; 16m (52ft) high and a third of the original circumference, enough to fit 2,000 extras. Computers filled in the second and third tiers and the statues, pasting images of real extras on to the virtual seating. </p> <p>Not all scenes were filmed in Malta. A battle in Germania between a barbarian army and Roman legions was shot in Bourne Woods in Farnham, Surrey. A provincial gladiator school and arena were built in Morocco. </p> <p>Just outside Rome lies the huge, underused sets of Cinecitta, the studio where Cleopatra, Ben Hur and War and Peace were made. Attempts are under way to revive it, and with it the golden age of Italian cinema. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio will film the \u00a350m Gangs of New York there this summer, but Scott was not tempted. The only bit of real Rome in his film is the lead characters' footwear, made by hand and shipped to Malta. </p> <p>Call it cheeky, call it postmodern, but the film's publicists staged photocalls and interviews in the Eternal City. In a hotel lobby two stones' throws from the Colosseum, Scott guffaws at the suggestion of having filmed here. \"I love the Colosseum, but it's full of pockmarks - it's wrecked. We did look at another coliseum in France, but in the end it was simpler to build one.\" </p> <p>Sitting beside him is Russell Crowe, whose character, General Maximus, wreaks havoc in the arena after becoming a gladiator.

      "bodyText": "Antiquity's most famous arena, the Colosseum, still hulks over Rome. Millions of sightseers flock to it every year, sit on the same seats as the baying mobs of 2,000 years ago, wander the dungeons where wild beasts were caged, and lapse into an awed silence. Ridley Scott is struck by its majesty and scale every time he visits. In the 8th century AD, Bede wrote: \"While the Colosseum stands, Rome shall stand, but when the Colosseum falls, Rome shall fall - and when Rome falls, the world will end,\" Well, the Colosseum is still standing. And when Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio commissioned a \u00a3120m epic about gladiators, Scott's pulse quickened. No director in a generation had been offered the opportunity to recreate imperial Rome. It was not enough merely to evoke the Colosseum's atmosphere and scale. No other monument better embodies man's ingenuity and brutality, and the director of Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise wanted the set of a lifetime. Everything had to be viscerally real. The actors and audience had to see, hear and smell the arena. Scott went to Malta. The real Colosseum - all of Rome in fact - he left to the tourists. He preferred to build from scratch on an empty parade ground, using less bricks and mortar than Romulus and Remus on a slow day. The result? A triumph. Scott gallops the audience through a sprawling metropolis of winding streets, markets, temples, palaces, avenues and arches before depositing it, breathless, at the Colosseum. The camera climbs up its three tiers, tips over the retractable canvas roof then plunges into the 50,000 spectators screaming for blood. Seconds later it is swooping into the bowels, where pulleys hoist cages of gladiators to the surface. The grilles lift, the fighters sprint into the sunlit arena and the games begin. It is one of cinema's most ambitious, and successful, recreations of imperial Rome - achieved without setting foot in the city. For this, hail computer graphic imaging. British technicians built a fragment of the Colosseum's first tier; 16m (52ft) high and a third of the original circumference, enough to fit 2,000 extras. Computers filled in the second and third tiers and the statues, pasting images of real extras on to the virtual seating. Not all scenes were filmed in Malta. A battle in Germania between a barbarian army and Roman legions was shot in Bourne Woods in Farnham, Surrey. A provincial gladiator school and arena were built in Morocco. Just outside Rome lies the huge, underused sets of Cinecitta, the studio where Cleopatra, Ben Hur and War and Peace were made. Attempts are under way to revive it, and with it the golden age of Italian cinema. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio will film the \u00a350m Gangs of New York there this summer, but Scott was not tempted. The only bit of real Rome in his film is the lead characters' footwear, made by hand and shipped to Malta. Call it cheeky, call it postmodern, but the film's publicists staged photocalls and interviews in the Eternal City. In a hotel lobby two stones' throws from the Colosseum, Scott guffaws at the suggestion of having filmed here. \"I love the Colosseum, but it's full of pockmarks - it's wrecked. We did look at another coliseum in France, but in the end it was simpler to build one.\" Sitting beside him is Russell Crowe, whose character, General Maximus, wreaks havoc in the arena after becoming a gladiator. Did he share the attitude of Ewan McGregor, who was bored and bothered by acting in an empty blue space for The Phantom Menace? Not at all. \"When 2,000 extras are screaming at you, it doesn't feel like you're acting in a void. It's real.\" Filming a battle scene in the depths of a Surrey winter did not require much imagination, either. \"It was snowing, we had horses, we had fires, it was like two real armies. Those weren't computers.\" Crowe, a New Zealander best known for LA Confidential and The Insider, is keen to reassure Italians that he does value their history. The writings of Marcus Aurelius, the real emperor and father figure to his character, deepened his understanding. \"I've been to Rome three times before and each time I've visited the Colosseum. It's incredible. To think that it's been there for 2,500 years.\" He's overstating the case by about 600 years, but no one corrects him, for even the Romans do not mind being spurned in favour of Malta and computers.

      "byline": "Charlotte Higgins",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Latin is not a dead language. Minimus, a Latin course aimed at primary school pupils, is proving so popular that its author, Barbara Bell, is appealing nationwide for Latinists to emerge from their cobweb-strewn, Horace-bedecked libraries, brush off their Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primers (or Shortbread Latin Primers, as the dog-eared classroom copies always used to end up) and help set up Latin clubs in schools. </p> <p>In fact, Minimus is far from dusty. In my day we had prissy Cornelia (Cornelia est in horto is a phrase engraved on my heart), Marcus her boring brother and the slightly naughty Sextus (that was ever such a funny name when you were 11). We hated them. </p> <p>Minimus, on the other hand, is a cutesome little mouseykins who lives at the Roman settlement of Vindolanda, on Hadrian's Wall. He is a cheeky soul, always trying to snaffle morsels from the laden dining tables of the humans. He is also, we are given to believe, a native Briton and therefore a conquered, colonised mouse. In his spare time from being pursued by the cat Vibrissa, he doles out helpful advice to modern schoolchildren on Latin grammar. </p> <p>It is witty, characterful and uses original everyday documents found near Hadrian's Wall to add immediacy to the whole thing (sadly these do look like boring grey smudges when reproduced in the book). But what's the point of it all? </p> <p>What made Bell write the book, she says, was that she was concerned about children's understanding of English. \"It is through Latin that I learned about the English language, and learned so many English words derived from Latin. Knowing Latin gives a wonderful general language awareness that is ideal when children come on to learn other languages like German, Spanish and Italian.\" And, she says, children love it (they must make children of very stern stuff these days). \"Latin is beautifully structured,\" she enthuses, \"and children like rules.

      "bodyText": "Latin is not a dead language. Minimus, a Latin course aimed at primary school pupils, is proving so popular that its author, Barbara Bell, is appealing nationwide for Latinists to emerge from their cobweb-strewn, Horace-bedecked libraries, brush off their Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primers (or Shortbread Latin Primers, as the dog-eared classroom copies always used to end up) and help set up Latin clubs in schools. In fact, Minimus is far from dusty. In my day we had prissy Cornelia (Cornelia est in horto is a phrase engraved on my heart), Marcus her boring brother and the slightly naughty Sextus (that was ever such a funny name when you were 11). We hated them. Minimus, on the other hand, is a cutesome little mouseykins who lives at the Roman settlement of Vindolanda, on Hadrian's Wall. He is a cheeky soul, always trying to snaffle morsels from the laden dining tables of the humans. He is also, we are given to believe, a native Briton and therefore a conquered, colonised mouse. In his spare time from being pursued by the cat Vibrissa, he doles out helpful advice to modern schoolchildren on Latin grammar. It is witty, characterful and uses original everyday documents found near Hadrian's Wall to add immediacy to the whole thing (sadly these do look like boring grey smudges when reproduced in the book). But what's the point of it all? What made Bell write the book, she says, was that she was concerned about children's understanding of English. \"It is through Latin that I learned about the English language, and learned so many English words derived from Latin. Knowing Latin gives a wonderful general language awareness that is ideal when children come on to learn other languages like German, Spanish and Italian.\" And, she says, children love it (they must make children of very stern stuff these days). \"Latin is beautifully structured,\" she enthuses, \"and children like rules. They can see patterns in the language that they find extremely satisfying.\" Still, you can sweeten the pill as much as you like, but when push comes to shove, you still have to learn your hic haec hoc. One mother, an ex-Oxford classicist, whose daughter is learning Latin from Minimus, says that her child started out all enthusiastic \"but now she hates it just as much as we used to, and I have to bully her into doing it.

Britain is going to join the euro. The question is when and at what rate. The principle should now be dealt with and at the earliest possible moment.\" Mr Heseltine called on the prime minister to reinforce a declaration on the euro with a pledge to join the currency at a lower level of sterling than the current high rate. His intervention underlined the growing strains within the cross-party Britain in Europe group, launched by Mr Heseltine and Mr Blair last year. The Tory pro-European \"big beasts\", who also include the former chancellor Kenneth Clarke, are increasingly frustrated with the government's refusal to give a firmer commitment on joining the euro.",

But he warned the farmers against rejecting redistribution. \"If there is going to be resistance, then we might go much further and say you don't acknowledge the justice of our cause. And if you do not, then, from every angle, you are not fit to be one of us,\" he said. \"The 20,000 that the British want to leave the country are free to leave and we will assist them by showing them the various ways out of the country.\" At times he broadened his attack on a \"very vicious international campaign against Zimbabwe\", although he did not directly criticise the Commonwealth ministerial action group for its condemnation of his government on Tuesday. He blamed the Movement for Democratic Change, which the government parodies as the \"Movement for Destroying the Country\", for spreading political violence and added: \"They got more than they bargained for\". He regretted the killing of at least 15 people, including the murder of two white farmers - David Stevens and Martin Olds - but accused journalists of over-emphasising their deaths. \"We are sorry that there have been some deaths; and those deaths are not just of Stevens and Olds, there have been some blacks. But the CNN and the BBC is only interested in projecting the deaths of the whites. We don't die. Only the whites die. They have a greater life than us. More sacred.\" He criticised the financial policies imposed on Zimbabwe by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, saying they had made capitalists richer but had done nothing for the poor. Zanu-PF's election manifesto promises that both these organisations, and foreign donors, will be \"removed from having any direct or indirect role in managing and controlling our country's fiscal policy\". But always he returned to his verbal assault on the UK. He criticised Britain for failing to put together a high-powered delegation to meet the three Zimbabwean cabinet ministers who flew to London for talks last week. He said they had expected to meet the government's economic experts to discuss funding the land redistribution, but all they got was the foreign secretary. \"It was Mr Robin Cook, who wanted to use the meeting for propaganda purposes,\" he said. \"It was sad, very sad.\"",

Estimates of Labour converts are strongly rejected by the party's candidate Andrew Howard, who insists Labour is \"fighting for every vote\".</p> <p>Talk of a shock result in such a solidly Tory constituency, the 50th safest Conservative seat in the UK, is bold. Lib Dems acknowledge that a swing large enough to win them Romsey by just one vote would translate at a general election into 103 Lib Dem parliamentary seats and 70 Tory ones.</p> <p>But even taking a significant bite out of the Conservatives' share of the vote would constitute a confidence boosting achievement for the Lib Dems. Mr Kennedy said yesterday: \"If the Conservatives, in what should be, historically, one of the safest seats in the country, experience any loss of support in our direction when they are not in government, then they really are in potentially terminal trouble.\"</p> <p>The Tories, running a less effervescent campaign which has nevertheless seen three visits by Mr Hague, deny Lib Dem suggestions they are rattled.</p> <p>The euro and asylum seekers are key concerns on the doorstep, they claim.

      "bodyText": "Today's byelection in Romsey will produce a photo-finish, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy predicted yesterday as he claimed significant slippage in the Tory vote could leave William Hague's party in \"terminal trouble\". In a final push before today's poll, both Lib Dems and Tories flooded the traditionally true blue Hampshire seat with MPs and activists to maintain momentum in a race both sides acknowledge could depend on turn-out. With 3,300 council seats at stake as well, all three party leaders clashed at Commons question time. Mr Hague again played the law and order card while Mr Kennedy joined forces with Tony Blair to condemn the Tory leader for stirring up the asylum issue in search of votes. Unembarrassed by a British National party claim that he had \"pinched our campaign\" on asylum seekers and the euro, Mr Hague hammered Labour's \"wretched weakness\" on crime, including Monday's anti-capitalist riot in London. Mr Blair defended Labour's record and pointedly told MPs that Mr Hague had not dared run his anti-asylum scare tactics in the Commons itself. Accusing Mr Hague of \"leaping on any passing bandwagon\" he told one MP that the Tory leader's \"desperation is rather bigger than his judgement.\" While Mr Kennedy, buoyed by a 600-strong party rally and frenetic campaign, talked tough in an eve-of-poll press conference, the Conservatives fielded shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe in the leafy, Conservative-voting, north of the sprawling Romsey constituency. The Tories are confident their Eton-educated candidate, Dorset farmer Tim Palmer, will hold the seat made vacant after the death of sitting MP Michael Colvin in a house fire in February. The Lib Dems, pushing the local credentials of Romsey pharmacist Sandra Gidley, publicly claim the seat is within their grasp and privately believe they can at least whittle the Tories' 8,585 majority down to within 1,000 votes. Doing so would require Mr Kennedy's party to win over substantial numbers of Labour voters in housing estates on the Southampton fringes, banking on a combination of disillusion with Tony Blair's government and a measure of tactical voting to keep out a Tory MP. Labour's search for votes saw the party field cabinet members, David Blunkett and Alan Milburn, to warn voters that the Tories would threaten improvements in education and health - not least by forcing elderly people to pay \u00a32,000 for a cataract operation outside the NHS. Lib Dem campaign chief Lord Rennard, who has consistently talked up his party's chances in Romsey, yesterday claimed half of Labour supporters canvassed indicated they were planning to vote Lib Dem, together with a third of wavering Conservatives. Estimates of Labour converts are strongly rejected by the party's candidate Andrew Howard, who insists Labour is \"fighting for every vote\". Talk of a shock result in such a solidly Tory constituency, the 50th safest Conservative seat in the UK, is bold. Lib Dems acknowledge that a swing large enough to win them Romsey by just one vote would translate at a general election into 103 Lib Dem parliamentary seats and 70 Tory ones. But even taking a significant bite out of the Conservatives' share of the vote would constitute a confidence boosting achievement for the Lib Dems. Mr Kennedy said yesterday: \"If the Conservatives, in what should be, historically, one of the safest seats in the country, experience any loss of support in our direction when they are not in government, then they really are in potentially terminal trouble.\" The Tories, running a less effervescent campaign which has nevertheless seen three visits by Mr Hague, deny Lib Dem suggestions they are rattled. The euro and asylum seekers are key concerns on the doorstep, they claim. One source said: \"The Lib Dems have played it very parochially - it's all cycle paths and broken paving stones.\" Miss Widdecombe, striding up Stockbridge's quaint high street, used her visit to announce new proposals for \"cops in shops\" - basing neighbourhood bobbies in local shops or pubs to increase public accessibility and deter criminals. In the local elections there are 3,360 seats up for grabs in 153 councils. Labour is bracing itself for losses because it is defending seats won in 1996 at the height of John Major's unpopularity.

      "body": "<p>Britain last night stepped up its campaign to curb government attacks on white farmers and opposition parties in Zimbabwe by announcing the suspension of all new export licences for arms and military equipment to Robert Mugabe's regime.</p> <p>In a move that reflects growing despair in Whitehall that President Mugabe is not going to respond to Commonwealth pressure for \"constructive engagement\", the remaining supply of 450 Land Rovers to the Zimbabwean police has also been halted - \"until there is a clear determination to restore the rule of law\".</p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, made the announcement in a Commons statement after hearing reports of what he called Mr Mugabe's inflammatory speech made earlier yesterday, in which he renewed his \"anti-imperalist\" rhetoric against Britain.</p> <p>In a scathing attack, Mr Mugabe launched his election platform with a pledge that \"hostile British neo-colonialism\" would not force him to backtrack on plans to redistribute about half the white-owned farmland in Zimbabwe to poor black peasants.</p> <p>\"We won't allow them to determine our destiny. We determine it ourselves, the people of Zimbabwe. Not from Downing Street, not from the British parliament. And let those who are pretending that they can determine our future realise we fought for it. We can still fight for it,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The British government says it has no further colonial responsibility for Zimbabwe, but every day they are talking about Zimbabwe and want to direct our affairs. No sanction of whatever nature can make us desist from our quest for land.\"</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's rhetoric prompted Whitehall to send a clear but limited signal to Harare. But the Zimbabwean opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, was quick to admit that it would have \"minimal\" effect\", and would enable Mr Mugabe to claim that he was once more a victim of colonial manipulation.</p> <p>Mr Cook told MPs: \"In the present circumstances of spreading violence, we have resolved that from today Britain will refuse all new export licence applications for arms and military equipment to Zimbabwe. This will include all licences for spare parts in connection with previous contracts such as Hawk aircraft.\"</p> <p>The Tories and Liberal Democrats backed the decision. Mr Cook is treading a tightrope between calls from some Conservative MPs for tougher action, including wider sanctions, and the more conciliatory approach of the Commonwealth ministerial action group (CMAG).</p> <p>\"All Britain's concerns have now been supported by a body representing all the Commonwealth,\" Mr Cook said. Their \"united message\" was to the majority in Zimbabwe who wanted to live in a free democracy under the rule of law - a claim that Mr Mugabe derided because no such conditions had existed under colonial rule, he said.</p> <p>Yet there were signs last night that the Foreign Office's claims that this week's CMAG meeting endorsed the UK position went further than Don McKinnon, the secretary general - who is to carry the message to Mr Mugabe in person - would have wished.</p> <p>The Commonwealth seeks constructive engagement and free credible elections to ease Zimbabwe through a difficult time, officials stressed. But sanctions are not on its agenda. Nor was Zimbabwe officially part of CMAG's remit this week, they added.</p> <p>Both Mr Cook and Tony Blair want \"fair elections without violence\" too. Mr Mugabe has until August to call a parliamentary election under the constitutional timetable, and Whitehall wants to avoid giving him any excuse to cancel the ballot.</p> <p>Yesterday ministers repeatedly stressed their willingness to support land reform in Zimbabwe, but only if it was linked to the restoration of the rule of law, a fair price paid for expropriated farms and a \"genuine\" programme that eases the plight of the landless rural poor - a coded phrase to distinguish real reform from handouts to Mugabe allies.</p> <p>Amid cheers from MPs, Mr Cook said that Mr Mugabe's speech suggested that his government's interest in land reform was merely \"to create a condition of crisis in which he can secure its re-election\" after 20 years in power and deepening economic malaise.</p> <p>\"Opposition campaigners have been ambushed and beaten up. Commercial companies who display opposition posters have had their properties fire-bombed. Rural communities have been threatened that it will be known which ballot box came from their village.</p> <p>By the end of the past month of election campaigning, 14 political activists had been murdered, all of them supporters of the opposition,\" Mr Cook said.</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai has urged Britain not to impose economic sanctions.

      "bodyText": "Britain last night stepped up its campaign to curb government attacks on white farmers and opposition parties in Zimbabwe by announcing the suspension of all new export licences for arms and military equipment to Robert Mugabe's regime. In a move that reflects growing despair in Whitehall that President Mugabe is not going to respond to Commonwealth pressure for \"constructive engagement\", the remaining supply of 450 Land Rovers to the Zimbabwean police has also been halted - \"until there is a clear determination to restore the rule of law\". Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, made the announcement in a Commons statement after hearing reports of what he called Mr Mugabe's inflammatory speech made earlier yesterday, in which he renewed his \"anti-imperalist\" rhetoric against Britain. In a scathing attack, Mr Mugabe launched his election platform with a pledge that \"hostile British neo-colonialism\" would not force him to backtrack on plans to redistribute about half the white-owned farmland in Zimbabwe to poor black peasants. \"We won't allow them to determine our destiny. We determine it ourselves, the people of Zimbabwe. Not from Downing Street, not from the British parliament. And let those who are pretending that they can determine our future realise we fought for it. We can still fight for it,\" he said. \"The British government says it has no further colonial responsibility for Zimbabwe, but every day they are talking about Zimbabwe and want to direct our affairs. No sanction of whatever nature can make us desist from our quest for land.\" Mr Mugabe's rhetoric prompted Whitehall to send a clear but limited signal to Harare. But the Zimbabwean opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, was quick to admit that it would have \"minimal\" effect\", and would enable Mr Mugabe to claim that he was once more a victim of colonial manipulation. Mr Cook told MPs: \"In the present circumstances of spreading violence, we have resolved that from today Britain will refuse all new export licence applications for arms and military equipment to Zimbabwe. This will include all licences for spare parts in connection with previous contracts such as Hawk aircraft.\" The Tories and Liberal Democrats backed the decision. Mr Cook is treading a tightrope between calls from some Conservative MPs for tougher action, including wider sanctions, and the more conciliatory approach of the Commonwealth ministerial action group (CMAG). \"All Britain's concerns have now been supported by a body representing all the Commonwealth,\" Mr Cook said. Their \"united message\" was to the majority in Zimbabwe who wanted to live in a free democracy under the rule of law - a claim that Mr Mugabe derided because no such conditions had existed under colonial rule, he said. Yet there were signs last night that the Foreign Office's claims that this week's CMAG meeting endorsed the UK position went further than Don McKinnon, the secretary general - who is to carry the message to Mr Mugabe in person - would have wished. The Commonwealth seeks constructive engagement and free credible elections to ease Zimbabwe through a difficult time, officials stressed. But sanctions are not on its agenda. Nor was Zimbabwe officially part of CMAG's remit this week, they added. Both Mr Cook and Tony Blair want \"fair elections without violence\" too. Mr Mugabe has until August to call a parliamentary election under the constitutional timetable, and Whitehall wants to avoid giving him any excuse to cancel the ballot. Yesterday ministers repeatedly stressed their willingness to support land reform in Zimbabwe, but only if it was linked to the restoration of the rule of law, a fair price paid for expropriated farms and a \"genuine\" programme that eases the plight of the landless rural poor - a coded phrase to distinguish real reform from handouts to Mugabe allies. Amid cheers from MPs, Mr Cook said that Mr Mugabe's speech suggested that his government's interest in land reform was merely \"to create a condition of crisis in which he can secure its re-election\" after 20 years in power and deepening economic malaise. \"Opposition campaigners have been ambushed and beaten up. Commercial companies who display opposition posters have had their properties fire-bombed. Rural communities have been threatened that it will be known which ballot box came from their village. By the end of the past month of election campaigning, 14 political activists had been murdered, all of them supporters of the opposition,\" Mr Cook said. Mr Tsvangirai has urged Britain not to impose economic sanctions. Last night he questioned the value of yesterday's military restrictions, saying that it would have been better coming from international organisations. He also said that the effect would be minimal, mainly felt by the air force which would not be able to obtain spare parts for its Hawk trainers.",

Ten of the 11 members of the Commons defence committee signed a motion deploring the decision to hold the debate on the day of the English local elections. Iain Duncan-Smith, shadow defence secretary, accused the government of \"shamefully running away\" from a debate at a time when grave concerns were being expressed about the state of Britain's armed forces\". Responding to the public row between Clare Short, international development secretary, and the MoD over the cost of supplying helicopters, the international development committee accused the MoD of tending to offer a \"Rolls - Royce\" service with too many support staff \"at the expense of flexibility and speedy deployment\". The MoD initially charged \u00a32.3m for the hire of four Puma helicopters, two Hovercraft, air transporters and 170 support staff. Ms Short decided instead to charter five helicopters locally for \u00a3870,000. She subsequently agreed to send four Pumas to Mozambique after the MoD cut the bill to \u00a31m. She told the committee that while there were 100 staff servicing the MoD's Pumas, there were only 10 looking after the locally chartered helicopters. Geoff Hoon, defence secretary, said: \"The MoD is looking at the lessons arising from our assistance to Mozambique to make sure we can do even better in the future.\"",

As the long-awaited trial got under way at a specially constituted Scottish court in the Netherlands, the alleged intelligence agents repeated that they were not guilty of bombing Pan Am flight 103. In a statement read out by the clerk of the court at Camp Zeist, the defence claimed that members of two Syrian-backed Palestinian groups -one a prosecution witness - planted the device. A second crown witness, Parviz Taheri, was also named as being involved in the alleged crimes of murder, conspiracy to murder and breaches of the Aviation Security Act. The submission of a special defence of incrimination, a Scottish legal peculiarity, came moments after Lord Sutherland, the presiding judge, opened proceedings against Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, who surrendered for trial last year. The defence named Mohammed Abu Talb, a Palestinian serving a life sentence in Sweden for earlier bombings in Denmark and the Netherlands, as one of 10 other alleged conspirators. Abu Talb was an early suspect in the case, but investigators abandoned that line of inquiry before the two Libyans were indicted in 1991. He is listed as one of more than 1,000 witnesses due to give evidence for the prosecution. Seven other named Arab men were described as members of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, a small and now, in effect, defunct organisation founded with Syrian support in 1969, which has never before been mentioned in connection with Lockerbie. The seven, whose whereabouts are unknown, were also described as formerly directors of the Miska Bakery in Malta, where the suitcase containing the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103 was allegedly loaded onto a feeder flight to Frankfurt, and thence to London. The defence statement referred also to unnamed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command, a larger group based in Damascus. No details were available about Mr Taheri, though his name is evidently Iranian. In an interview broadcast shortly before the trial began, the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadafy, dismissed a suggestion that the two accused acted under his direct orders. \"It is an absurd question that should not have been asked,\" he told Sky Television. \"Ever since 1977, I have no political or administrative responsibility, because I have handed over the authority to the people.

      "bodyText": "A Church of England diocese has dropped out of the government's new deal programme because it was \"too bureaucratic\", it emerged yesterday. Church leaders in Liverpool decided to sever links with the scheme aimed at helping young jobless people secure work. They blamed their decision on \"the many obstacles and difficulties\" encountered during their involvement with the programme. The move was made after the church carried out a review of its dealings with the scheme, the findings of which were sent to the Department for Education and Employment. Since joining, 14 people have passed through the scheme and were employed in a variety of posts, including administrative and nursery work. A Liverpool diocesan spokesman, Ultan Russell, said: \"The decision was really taken on the grounds that the bureaucracy of it meant that at a practical level, it cost us more to run the scheme than we got back from central government. \"We were dealing with something centrally which may be dealt with better locally. The bureaucracy was like something out of a Kafka novel.\" Other problems encountered by the church included the lack of specialist support and advisers overburdened with casework while some trainees were referred to unsuitable placements. \"The poor souls hadn't got anything like the support we anticipated. We had a situation where one girl told us that she didn't want to work in a nursery and we were told that they would try to force her,\" added Mr Russell. He said it was a pity as \"something that has such potential in it could really develop if efforts were made\". A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment said that it welcomed the Church of England's comments and would respond to them in detail. \"We are sorry that the diocese of Liverpool have now withdrawn from their subcontract,\" he said. He added: \"The new deal has proven to be a considerable success because of the contribution of a wide variety of organisations and more than 199,000 young people have already been placed into work. \"However, we are always looking to improve the new deal, and we welcome their comments which we will respond to in detail.\"",

Violent protest is the dictatorship of the individual. It begets the tyranny of the state. Confronted by violent citizens, government introduces more restrictive law, and tougher military policing, which the media and silent majority approve. The underlying issues are ignored and public debate refocuses around points of law and order. Democracy narrows and the rights and opportunities of aware and active citizens shrink. This law of revolutionary consequence happens as easily in mature, as in fledgling, democracies.</p> <p>Witness Britain's various public order and criminal justice acts, brought in in response to the poll tax riots and the violent (not the peaceful) anti-roads objectors. These illiberal laws block much significant democratic challenge to government and companies. I bet Jack Straw just loves those merry May Day mobsters - the perfect justification for his draconian Anti-Terrorist Bill, which threatens to make criminals of anyone who dares to publicly oppose official authority.</p> <p>What the hot-heads have to understand is that you don't need violence to win, at least not in a democratic, regulated market economy. Companies do not make products that consumers ignore. No bad company practice can withstand the challenge of media expose, preventative laws or tax regimes, or shareholders dumping stock in protest. Witness Monsanto, or Shell, or many other examples.</p> <p>The initial challenge for campaigners is to get the right information to the right people in the right way at the right time. Information is the first step to democratically exercising power. The second is to act upon it effectively. That means creating cam paign opportunities for citizens to use that knowledge - as voters, consumers, shareholders, investors, taxpayers - to shape what happens next. The third step is to peacefully organise and mobilise that activism toward government and company decision-makers so that transformation occurs.<br><b>Charles Secrett</b><br> Director, Friends of the Earth</p> <p>\u0095 Violence is grotesque, but even the limited democracy we have is borne of it. Parliament itself is a result of the violent struggles of the English civil war. The forces of capitalism and the state employ violent methods to retain the status quo: we can't wish it away. There have been enough failed earth summits and abandoned parliamentary reforms.</p> <p>The answer lies in a fresh and radical approach that learns the lessons of the past and that is what the pre-May Day conference was all about (Letters, May 3).

      "bodyText": "It will take far more than the mindless smashing of a few corporate shop windows in Seattle or Westminster to remedy the endemic ecological destruction and social injustices perpetuated by those wrong-headed political and business elites who currently rule the world (Blair vents outrage at rioters, May 4). Violent protest is the dictatorship of the individual. It begets the tyranny of the state. Confronted by violent citizens, government introduces more restrictive law, and tougher military policing, which the media and silent majority approve. The underlying issues are ignored and public debate refocuses around points of law and order. Democracy narrows and the rights and opportunities of aware and active citizens shrink. This law of revolutionary consequence happens as easily in mature, as in fledgling, democracies. Witness Britain's various public order and criminal justice acts, brought in in response to the poll tax riots and the violent (not the peaceful) anti-roads objectors. These illiberal laws block much significant democratic challenge to government and companies. I bet Jack Straw just loves those merry May Day mobsters - the perfect justification for his draconian Anti-Terrorist Bill, which threatens to make criminals of anyone who dares to publicly oppose official authority. What the hot-heads have to understand is that you don't need violence to win, at least not in a democratic, regulated market economy. Companies do not make products that consumers ignore. No bad company practice can withstand the challenge of media expose, preventative laws or tax regimes, or shareholders dumping stock in protest. Witness Monsanto, or Shell, or many other examples. The initial challenge for campaigners is to get the right information to the right people in the right way at the right time. Information is the first step to democratically exercising power. The second is to act upon it effectively. That means creating cam paign opportunities for citizens to use that knowledge - as voters, consumers, shareholders, investors, taxpayers - to shape what happens next. The third step is to peacefully organise and mobilise that activism toward government and company decision-makers so that transformation occurs. Charles Secrett Director, Friends of the Earth \u0095 Violence is grotesque, but even the limited democracy we have is borne of it. Parliament itself is a result of the violent struggles of the English civil war. The forces of capitalism and the state employ violent methods to retain the status quo: we can't wish it away. There have been enough failed earth summits and abandoned parliamentary reforms. The answer lies in a fresh and radical approach that learns the lessons of the past and that is what the pre-May Day conference was all about (Letters, May 3). It does not lie in policies presented to governments bought off by the Fossil Fuel Lobby (US) or corporations subsidising host state armies (South America). The inevitability of violence will be determined by the reaction of those in control of the current system to the demands for change. Daniel Neville London \u0095 In 1894, 200-300 young rowdies smashed a screen that was erected to separated the audience in the Empire Music Hall from the bar and its prostitutes. They paraded in triumph around Leicester Square and were addressed by their ringleader. Winston Churchill. A bit of paint? I'm sure he'd understand. Trevor Hopper Brighton",

      "bodyText": "A new crime of sexual abuse within families is expected to be proposed by the home secretary, Jack Straw, next month as part of the first major overhaul of the law on sexual offences in England and Wales for nearly 50 years. Ministers hope that the new offence will finally kill off any lingering \"keep it in the family\" belief among the public, the police and the courts and emphasise that the law protects the victims of sexual crimes that take place in the family home. The new offence of \"sexual abuse within families\" would bring together existing crimes such as incest, rape and indecent assault but at the same time would make clear that the law no longer regarded such crimes as private matters. Indeed, ministers are keen to stress that they regard crimes committed in the home or within a relationship as a breach of trust, which the criminal justice system should recognise as an aggravating and more serious factor. The first major overhaul of the law since the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, to be published next month, is also expected to redefine the boundary between rape and indecent assault so that serious sex attacks that stop short of attempted rape attract much heavier penalties than the law currently allows. At present, the maximum sentence for indecent assault stands at 10 years but a change in the law could mean that life imprisonment becomes an option to a judge sentencing in a case involving a very serious violation. Home Office ministers are nervous about the public reaction to the proposed changes, fearing that they could prove as controversial as the current debate over the repeal of section 28 on the alleged promotion of homosexuality. The Whitehall review was set up in 1998 after concerns that the criminal law was not delivering effective protection to victims, children and mentally incapacitated people and that abusers were not being appropriately punished. Among its more startling findings is the conclusion that 75% of the sex workers in Soho brothels come from abroad - particularly the Balkans - and that they work in an industry that is worth \u00a312m a year. The review is also expected to recommend that a new offence is created to protect vulnerable people from abuse by their carers and to replace the current law which, in outdated language, bans \"sexual intercourse with mental defectives\". The Home Office review team whose report has recently gone to ministers found that many mentally impaired people regarded sexual abuse as a normal part of their lives. The wide-ranging review of sex offences is also expected to lead to a more consistent approach in the law to the different treatment of child victims of different ages. In some cases it is illegal to engage in certain sexual practices with a child under 18, although the age of consent has been equalised at 16, while the penalties facing abusers of children under 13 are much more punitive than for offences against those aged 13 to 16. The review team, which has been studying the problem for two years, is also expected to recommend the creation of a new offence of necrophilia -having sex with the dead - which curiously has never been an offence under English law. Changes that highlight the need to define and clarify the meaning of consent in rape cases have already been trailed, as have moves to extend the definition of rape to include forced oral sex. But the review group is believed to have rejected the option of creating a new lesser offence of \"date rape\", on the grounds that rape should retain its status as second only to murder. The review confirmed that only about half of rape suspects are charged and even fewer are prosecuted.",

      "bodyText": "Tobacco smuggling is now second only to drugs in terms of consumer spending on illegal activities, according to a report published yesterday. The Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, which commissioned the report, described as \"breathtaking\" the scale of criminal activity and the government's failure to deal with it. The study, carried out by the independent consultants DTZ Pieda, claims that 16.6bn black market cigarettes, or over 830m packets, were sold illegally in the United Kingdom last year. \"At an average street price of \u00a32.50 a pack, this equates to over \u00a32bn in revenue for the smugglers and estimated untaxed profits of \u00a3415m,\" the report said. \"Add further profits of \u00a3123m from the \u00a3430m illegal sales of hand-rolling tobacco and it is not hard to see why organised crime has moved in on this lucrative and relatively risk-free business.\" And the report predicted that if cigarette smuggling expanded to the level of hand-rolling tobacco, revenue losses could rise to over \u00a311bn by 2005. \"With estimated sales of \u00a32.5bn a year, tobacco smuggling is now second only to drugs in terms of consumer spending on illegal activities,\" the report said. It also claimed that customs and excise managed to seize only a small proportion of all tobacco smuggled into the UK from Belgium and elsewhere. It concluded that if the government was to stamp out this black market it must: \u0095 Reduce the tobacco tax differential between Britain and the rest of Europe; \u0095 Restrict the quantity of cigarettes that can be legally imported for personal use; and \u0095 Make stiffer penalties for tobacco smugglers. Sir Donald Mackay, chairman of DTZ Pieda, said: \"Most people are aware that a black market in tobacco exists, but this is the first time it has been so thoroughly and independently investigated. \"The results are alarming and depressing, and should be required reading for all policy-makers.\" David Swan, chief executive of the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, said: \"If anyone still believes tobacco smuggling is a harmless activity practised by cross-channel transit van weekenders out to make a bit of extra pin money, they should study this report. \"The scale of criminal activity and the government's failure to deal with it is breathtaking.\"",

      "bodyText": "Independent schools have reported an increase in the number of their pupils for the fifth year in succession. Figures from the Independent Schools Information Service published yesterday showed a rise last year of 3,812 pupils, or 0.8%, to a total of more than 484,000. The growth at the 1,280 fee-paying schools that belong to the Independent Schools Council was across all age ranges - except for the sixth form, where numbers fell by 2%; this was attributed to a \"blip\" caused by weak recruitment in the mid 1990s. Independent schools attract 7% of all schoolchildren in England, and 10% in London. The overall growth was achieved despite a second year without a fresh intake receiving financial assistance under the assisted places scheme, to replace the 6,800 pupils who left in 1999. The last significant down turn in overall pupil numbers was recorded in the early 1980s, as a direct result of the economic recession. David Woodhead, director of the information service, said the strong economy had given parents confidence to invest in their children's education. \"Independent schools go from strength to strength. Growth has been achieved through all the main pre-school, junior and secondary ages,\" he said. \"For schools which have lost thousands of students from the assisted places scheme to increase the size of their new intake and their total pupil numbers is a remarkable achievement.\" The schools said the scrapping of the scheme (implemented by the government as a manifesto pledge) had had a worrying effect on the socioeconomic composition of schools, depriving them of many bright pupils whose parents could not afford the fees. The survey also showed a further collapse in the number of regular boarders, a fall of 2.6%, although there was a 76% leap in the proportion of day pupils opting for occasional boarding in \"sleepovers\". The schools warned that their fees would rise sharply in September, to take account for teachers' performance-related pay, which is to be adopted by some independent schools as well as by the state sector. Last year fees rose an average 6.3%, having risen 5.7% the previous year, though there was a 4.6% increase last year in the number of pupils receiving assistance from their schools in paying fees. The survey shows that the average pupil/teacher ratio in the independent sector remains at 1:10.6, much lower than the 1:18.6 ratio in the state sector, although actual class sizes are considerably higher for all schools. Capital investment by independent schools rose 17.4% in 1999, one of the largest annual increases recorded; the amount was \u00a3369m - an average of \u00a3767 a pupil as against \u00a3658 the previous year. \u0095Further education colleges in England were making progress in their financial management but there remained 56 colleges struggling to balance their books, the national audit office reported yesterday. Colleges experiencing financial difficulty \"grew rapidly\" between 1993 and 1997, Whitehall's spending watchdog reported. It warned: \"More recently the proportion has started to decline but still stands at about 13%.\" The office urged the worst performing colleges to adopt best practice from better managed institutions. There are 429 FE colleges in England with a combined income of \u00a34bn a year. The comptroller and auditor general, Sir John Bourn, said: \"The financial state of the sector is improving, but there are still too many colleges in poor financial health.\"",

      "body": "<p>The treatment of demonstrators by the police during the controversial state visit of the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, last year was unlawful, the Metropolitan force admitted in the high court yesterday.</p> <p>The Free Tibet Campaign said the Met had been forced into a humiliating climbdown after it agreed, before Mr Justice Burton, that \"it was unlawful for individual officers to remove banners and flags from people solely on the basis that they were protesting against the Chinese regime on October 19\".</p> <p>The force has also agreed to a carefully worded declaration that \"it would be unlawful to position police vans in front of the protesters if the reason for doing so was to suppress free speech\".</p> <p>The police took away Tibetan flags and pro-democracy banners from protesters but left Union flags and Chinese flags untouched. The Met continues to argue that vans were used to prevent public disorder, and not to hide demonstrators, outside Buckingham palace on October 19 and outside the Chinese embassy on October 21.</p> <p>The judge was told that while there was still substantial factual dispute between the two sides, the police have agreed to the granting of the two declarations.</p> <p>Lawyers for the Free Tibet Campaign, seeking judicial review, argued that the police's handling of the protests in the Mall, widely criticised by opposition parties, contravened the common law right to peaceful protest and articles 10, 11 and 14 of the European convention on human rights, which deal with freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, and discrimination. Although the Human Rights Act, which adopts the convention, does not become law until October, courts are already anticipating its effects in Britain.</p> <p>In an internal review, published on March 17 - condemned by the Free Tibet Campaign as a whitewash - the Met refers to the police applying a \"restrictive policy\". But the agreement announced yesterday refers to mistakes by individual officers, rather than to a policy.</p> <p>Alison Reynolds, director of the Free Tibet Campaign, yesterday called on Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner, to explain how the internal review \"came to defend as policy what the police now admit was unlawful\". She said: \"It stretches credibility to ask us to believe that all the officers in the Mall spontaneously made the same mistake by removing flags.

      "bodyText": "The treatment of demonstrators by the police during the controversial state visit of the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, last year was unlawful, the Metropolitan force admitted in the high court yesterday. The Free Tibet Campaign said the Met had been forced into a humiliating climbdown after it agreed, before Mr Justice Burton, that \"it was unlawful for individual officers to remove banners and flags from people solely on the basis that they were protesting against the Chinese regime on October 19\". The force has also agreed to a carefully worded declaration that \"it would be unlawful to position police vans in front of the protesters if the reason for doing so was to suppress free speech\". The police took away Tibetan flags and pro-democracy banners from protesters but left Union flags and Chinese flags untouched. The Met continues to argue that vans were used to prevent public disorder, and not to hide demonstrators, outside Buckingham palace on October 19 and outside the Chinese embassy on October 21. The judge was told that while there was still substantial factual dispute between the two sides, the police have agreed to the granting of the two declarations. Lawyers for the Free Tibet Campaign, seeking judicial review, argued that the police's handling of the protests in the Mall, widely criticised by opposition parties, contravened the common law right to peaceful protest and articles 10, 11 and 14 of the European convention on human rights, which deal with freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly, and discrimination. Although the Human Rights Act, which adopts the convention, does not become law until October, courts are already anticipating its effects in Britain. In an internal review, published on March 17 - condemned by the Free Tibet Campaign as a whitewash - the Met refers to the police applying a \"restrictive policy\". But the agreement announced yesterday refers to mistakes by individual officers, rather than to a policy. Alison Reynolds, director of the Free Tibet Campaign, yesterday called on Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan police commissioner, to explain how the internal review \"came to defend as policy what the police now admit was unlawful\". She said: \"It stretches credibility to ask us to believe that all the officers in the Mall spontaneously made the same mistake by removing flags. Senior officers did nothing to correct this and the Met's own review defended the action.\" Ian Johnston, an assistant commissioner at the Met, said this was \"a tricky area\" for colleagues to deal with. \"We didn't get it entirely right. We accept absolutely the blame for that ... On the day, our officers on the ground - because we didn't support them properly with decent briefings for the event over the complexity of the bylaws and the Vienna convention - individuals made decisions which we accept entirely were not right and we have apologised for that.\" But Mike Bennett, a former Metropolitan police federation chairman, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: \"Police officers today are very wary of their actions and the actions that were taken at the time would not have been taken unless the instruction came from above.\" The Foreign Office repeated its denial that it had put pressure on the Met to curb demonstrations, although in a Commons written answer, John Battle, the Foreign Office minister, admitted that officials and the Met had discussed the concerns of the Chinese about \"the possible impact of demonstrations on the visit\". Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said last night: \"It has been clear all along that the Foreign Office's first priority was to prevent the Chinese president being embarrassed. It must come clean on its precise role in [the] policing arrangements.\" Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, on Tuesday contrasted the treatment of protesters during the state visit with what she said was the more lax attitude to participants in the anti-capitalism protest on May Day. A Free Tibet Campaign spokeswoman said that the group was delighted with the Met's admission - the first time the police had declared that its handling of a protest was unlawful - but that without a full court case the truth about police decision-making during the visit might never come out.

      "body": "<p>International capitalism yesterday showed itself to be in fine fettle, despite May Day's demonstrators. The merger of the London Stock Exchange and the German Bourse opens the door to further restructuring of equity markets. And companies. By cutting transaction costs and making ownership more transparent the move must accelerate \"Anglo-American\" pursuit of shareholder value; shaken-out employees may regret it. Next, Madrid and Milan are to join International Exchanges (iX). Then Nasdaq will create with iX a new exchange for technology and growth stocks. Discussions with Euronext, the united Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam bourses, start at once. Around the corner lies continent-wide trading, within a single clearing and settlements system. Where politicians fear to tread - French finance minister Laurent Fabius yesterday bemoaned lack of movement on the pan-European front - profit-seekers pile in. Here is evidence of business remaking the world in its own image. Will regulators and public authorities be able to keep up?</p> <p>Although iX will trade more than half Europe's stocks, its turnover falls beneath the European Union competition threshold, so Brussels said it was unlikely to get involved. Protecting the public interest falls to the Financial Services Authority and the Federal Securities Supervisory Office. But while German and British minds may meet, can ad hoc arrangements work if the Spanish and Italians join? Who is to oversee the German-based, American-oriented exchange that will emerge after Nasdaq's European entry? On it the supply of capital for e-enterprise may depend. Capitalist competition, history shows, is usually only as productive as the framework of enforceable rules put around it by government. The slow-moving, hydra-headed bureaucracies of the EU do not look fit for the purpose here. Don Cruickshank, iX's chairman, may be a good chap who took the consumers' part against the banks but even saints cannot be trusted to regulate themselves.</p> <p>No one yesterday seemed concerned about the euro, which will probably be used to list iX prices - surprising on a day when dealers declared their lack of confidence in Greece's accession. Here is a paradox. The value of the euro falls, but countries queue up to join: Stockholm was avidly signalling its intention yesterday. In wait-and-see London nothing was deemed to have changed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "International capitalism yesterday showed itself to be in fine fettle, despite May Day's demonstrators. The merger of the London Stock Exchange and the German Bourse opens the door to further restructuring of equity markets. And companies. By cutting transaction costs and making ownership more transparent the move must accelerate \"Anglo-American\" pursuit of shareholder value; shaken-out employees may regret it. Next, Madrid and Milan are to join International Exchanges (iX). Then Nasdaq will create with iX a new exchange for technology and growth stocks. Discussions with Euronext, the united Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam bourses, start at once. Around the corner lies continent-wide trading, within a single clearing and settlements system. Where politicians fear to tread - French finance minister Laurent Fabius yesterday bemoaned lack of movement on the pan-European front - profit-seekers pile in. Here is evidence of business remaking the world in its own image. Will regulators and public authorities be able to keep up? Although iX will trade more than half Europe's stocks, its turnover falls beneath the European Union competition threshold, so Brussels said it was unlikely to get involved. Protecting the public interest falls to the Financial Services Authority and the Federal Securities Supervisory Office. But while German and British minds may meet, can ad hoc arrangements work if the Spanish and Italians join? Who is to oversee the German-based, American-oriented exchange that will emerge after Nasdaq's European entry? On it the supply of capital for e-enterprise may depend. Capitalist competition, history shows, is usually only as productive as the framework of enforceable rules put around it by government. The slow-moving, hydra-headed bureaucracies of the EU do not look fit for the purpose here. Don Cruickshank, iX's chairman, may be a good chap who took the consumers' part against the banks but even saints cannot be trusted to regulate themselves. No one yesterday seemed concerned about the euro, which will probably be used to list iX prices - surprising on a day when dealers declared their lack of confidence in Greece's accession. Here is a paradox. The value of the euro falls, but countries queue up to join: Stockholm was avidly signalling its intention yesterday. In wait-and-see London nothing was deemed to have changed.",

      "bodyText": "Four Filipino hostages were killed and five others, including children, were wounded yesterday when Philippine troops clashed with Muslim rebels on the southern island of Basilan, officials said. In separate incidents elsewhere in the Philippines, it was reported that Moro Islamic Liberation Front (Milf) guerrillas seized more than 100 hostages and launched grenades at an airport near the city of Cotabato, on the island of Mindanao; bombs at General Santos, also on Mindanao, killed four people; and at least two men were wounded in a five-hour gun battle between their Abu Sayyaf rebel captors and troops on Tuesday night. A spokesman for the Abu Sayyaf militia had earlier told television stations that a white male hostage was killed by a stray bullet and a white woman died of a heart attack during the fighting on Jolo island. He did not identify them. But a local government official on the island, 600 miles south of Manila, said all 21 hostages were alive. The defence secretary, Orlando Mercado, said 10 Filipino hostages, including seven children, from a group of at least 27 were rescued unhurt after clashes between their captors and troops on the nearby island of Basilan. At least four hostages were killed and five, including three children, were wounded, he said, denying earlier reports that 10 hostages might have been killed. \"The troops are still looking for the other hostages,\" he said. The children were among scores of people abducted by Abu Sayyaf rebels in raids on two secondary schools on Basilan on March 20. The army attacked the camp about 10 days ago after the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas said they had executed two male adults. Troops took control of the camp on Sunday but said many rebels escaped with the hostages. The news of the hostage deaths does not bode well for the mostly foreign captives held on Jolo. Their governments have appealed to Manila to ensure that the army is not asked to attack the guerrillas camp. The 21 hostages snatched by Abu Sayyaf from the Malaysian diving resort of Sipadan on Easter Sunday comprise 10 Malaysians, three Germans, two French nationals, two South Africans, two Finns, one Lebanese and a Filipina. About 2,000 troops have surrounded the rebel base and gun battles erupted in the area on Tuesday night. Journalists were barred from going near the camp yesterday. The violence racking the southern Philippines is the worst in the country since Muslim separatists agreed a peace deal with the government in 1996. Abu Sayyaf and Milf rejected the agreement and have continued their decades-long fight for Muslim self-rule in the south of the mainly Roman Catholic country. Mindanao island, the scene of the latest hostage-taking and bomb attacks reported by officials and army officers, is home to most of the 5m Muslims in the country's 74m population. It was not known if yesterday's explosions were linked to the Milf-led fighting, but officials in General Santos said they were convinced that they were the handiwork of the group. Philippine Airlines said it was cancelling today's flights to Cotabato and General Santos because of the violence and was not sure when they would resume. Milf pulled out of peace talks last week after claiming that troops had violated the shaky ceasefire. About 130 people have been killed since then in fighting between troops and Milf rebels.

She laid the two dead children on her bed, before injecting herself with potassium chloride and swallowing 28 anti-depressants. She left a suicide note for Shelby's father saying: \"I can't live like this any more, and I couldn't bear to leave my children behind to be a burden on you or to be separated and raised apart from their fathers and live knowing their mother killed herself.\" The prosecution portrayed her as a cold-blooded killer to whom her children were an \"inconvenience\". She was accused of leaving them locked in their room for hours while she went out at night to karaoke bars. Doctors testifying for her said she had been severely depressed as a result of sexual abuse as a child, a series of failed relationships with men, lack of money, and lack of self-esteem because of her obesity. She went to her death weighing 122kg (270lb). She agreed to the execution needles being put in her wrists when her executioners were unable to find a vein in her arm. Denying that her misfortunes excused her acts, the county prosecutor, Larry Jegley, said: \"She claims she was horribly depressed, she was overweight and she was a single mom, and she didn't have enough money. \"My response to that is 'welcome to America'. Plenty of folks are in far worse situations than she was.\" Women put to death in America A total of 560 women have been executed in the US, 3% of the convicts put to death. Five have been executed since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated after a brief moratorium: Velma Barfield By lethal injection in North Carolina on November 2 1984 for killing four people, including her mother and fiance, with ant poison. The sunday school teacher confessed and went to her death in pink pajamas after a meal of Cheez Doodles, a popular snack Karla Faye Tucker By lethal injection in Texas on February 3 1998 for hacking two people to death with a pickaxe. She claimed to have undergone a religious conversion in prison and appealed unsuccessfully to the state governor, George W Bush, for clemency Judy Buenoano By electric chair in Florida on March 30 1998 for poisoning her husband with arsenic. She was also convicted of drowning her son, who used a wheelchair Betty Lou Beets By lethal injection in Texas on February 24 2000 for shooting her fifth husband and burying his body in her garden. The 62-year-old grandmother had been charged with, but not convicted of, shooting dead her fourth husband, whose body was also found in the garden, and was convicted of shooting and wounding her second husband. She claimed that she had been the victim of physical abuse by her successive spouses, but her appeal for clemency was turned down by Mr Bush Christina Marie Riggs By lethal injection in Arkansas on May 2 2000 for the murder of her two children. She waived her right to appeal and forbade her lawyer to apply for clemency",

      "bodyText": "Abu Sayyaf, the militant group which brought terror to an idyllic Malaysian diving resort, is a distant splinter of the resurgent Islamic extremism erupting in the Middle East. Its founder, Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, found his calling while studying in Saudi Arabia. He received military training in Libya and fought alongside the mojahedin holy warriors against Soviet forces in Afghanistan - a breeding ground for Islamic militancy. There he is thought to have established contact with such extremist gurus as Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi alleged to have masterminded the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He adopted the name Abu Sayyaf, \"bearer of the sword\", and applied it to the small group of followers he attracted when he returned to the Philippines. His aim was to instil a \"pure\" form of Islam, under which he would ban television, dancing and even laughing with bared teeth. His supporters were mainly young Muslims, impatient with the moderate strategy of the older separatist leaders seeking an independent Muslim state in Mindanao. The new group proclaimed its arrival by bombing a port in the southern city of Zamboanga, aimed at a boat operating as a floating Christian bookshop. That was followed by attacks on the city's airport and a number of churches. Abu Sayyaf's founding principle was to target only soldiers, but the killing soon got out of hand. In 1993 he rolled grenades down the aisle of a Roman Catholic cathedral, killing seven worshippers. In 1995 his group moved into the small Christian town of Ipil and killed 53 soldiers and civilians before burning the settlement to the ground. In 1998 Janjalani was killed in an exchange of fire with the police, triggering a power struggle in Abu Sayyaf eventually won four months later by Janjalani's brother Khadaffy, an expert in the use of explosives. Abu Sayyaf is thought to retain links with its roots, receiving funding from the Middle East. Reports that the group was visited by Mr Bin Laden have never been confirmed, however. There are conspiracy theories circulating in the region that the Philippines army has encouraged the group, to discredit the separatist cause and sow divisions in the Muslim community. Its strength is estimated at about 200 armed men and a roughly equal number of unarmed sympathisers, based on the islands of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi at the southernmost tip of the Philippines. \"We may be small in number, but we have plenty fighting with us - the angels and the hand of Allah,\" Khadaffy Janjalani recently told journalists. \"We dream of an entire Islamic world, and we will achieve it.\"",

      "trailText": "<p>Adrian Searle is disturbed, frightened and mesmerised by the biggest and best show of film and video art the UK has ever seen</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Since the 60s, film and video have become familiar media for artists. Go into any major art school and you'll find as many students working with video cameras as there are chasing oil paint around a canvas with a hairy stick. The suspicion is, of course, that anyone who grew up with TV can make a half-decent video, while painting and sculpture take time, struggle and application. Wrong: making art is a state of mind, never mind the medium. </p> <p>With next week's opening of Tate Modern, London is gearing up for the arrival of the world's big-time museum directors, hot-shot curators and megabucks collectors, and the capital's commercial galleries are pulling out the stops to attract money and attention. The Lisson Gallery has taken over all five floors of a loft-style building in Covent Garden, filling 25,000 square feet of blacked-out emptiness with video and film work by 15 artists. This is the largest and best presented survey of such works ever seen in this country. No institution here - public or private - has ever attempted such an exhibition on this scale, nor cadged the space to do it properly. You wonder why not. </p> <p>The show opens with a come-hither performance, shown on a monitor, staged by Vanessa Beecroft. Beecroft is best known for staging sexy catwalk performances in galleries, and she is providing the first show for the Gagosian Gallery, opening its doors in London next week. Beecroft has a glamorous model go through a routine of cliched poses. The Lisson may as well have employed a professional greeter. But it is a clever opening. Wander into the dark round the corner and there's a naked guy called Rocky, a hollow-chested, weak-kneed pugilist in a rubber mask and boxing gloves, belting himself to a punch-drunk pulp. Muttering, grunting and flailing about, this wretched, one-man orgy of abuse slathers jam over himself between rounds. The camera goes up close and all too personal. His bottom is all gooey and his willy does a miniature can-can as he lunges around. This is ghastly, frightening. This is Paul McCarthy. </p> <p>McCarthy is one of the father-figures of contemporary video art, an inspiration and a stumbling-block for younger artists. Stumbling is the word - Rocky is a cruel, self-punishing and ultimately tragic work about masculinity, so filled with raging impotence and despairing testosterone that it has never been shown since it was made in 1976. A quarter century old, the piece could have been made yesterday, and it makes a lot of current younger British video art look pretty thin. </p> <p>How about some real death, then? Douglas Gordon shows us the big-screen death of a fly. Super-glued to the spot, the fly elicits horror and empathy. Deeper in the darkness, Tony Oursler's giant eyeball is watching TV. You can see the screen reflected in the disembodied eyeball, itself a projection onto a free-standing orb. When the eye blinks, it is like a clam opening and closing. </p> <p>Here, for perhaps the first time in Britain, we begin to get the measure of the medium, and how works, sensibilities, and generations of artists can have a dialogue. There are works which court outrage, are full of humour, which come close to pop-promo video, to pornography, to commercial film and TV. Others can only exist in the terms of the situation for which they were made. </p> <p>A bell tolls on the second floor, the soundtrack to Belgian artist Francis Al\u00ffs's 1997 Cuentos Patri\u00f3ticos (Patriotic Tales), a film of a lone shepherd leading sheep around a flagpole in a public square. With each slow circuit of the pole, another sheep joins the flock. This is a mesmerising and beautiful video, filmed, like many of the artist's works, in Mexico. The shadow cast by the pole never moves, the shepherd follows his own steps exactly, and it slowly becomes apparent that each circuit is the same circuit, all the sheep the same sheep, digitally tweaked into a flock. The pace and enigma are perfect, the politics sly. If You Are a Typical Spectator, What You Are Really Doing is Waiting for the Accident to Happen\" is the title of a second work here by Al\u00ffs. I carry the words with me, a warning to critics everywhere. </p> <p>Further up the building, fog drifts over the sea and over New York, in Igor and Svetlana Kopystiansky's new film, Fog. This is New York weather seen by two artists who left Moscow in the 70s, bringing their Russian lugubriousness with them. The fog rolls in on two screens. Watching one, you can't see the other. You turn and turn again, staring into the lustrous gloom for a break in the weather. </p> <p>A lot of video and film work presents us with the dichotomy between being here - in this space, watching these images - and entering the fictive world presented on the screen. One of the best juxtapositions is the cinema-like presentation and commercial production values of Rodney Graham's Vexation Island (a work better known by reputation and the critical attention it has been given since its Venice Biennale premier in 1997), with Pierre Bismuth's Alternance, which fills a long wall with four abutted projections of a Paris street scene. Alternance almost demands that we walk alongside it, as though we ourselves were in that little square on the Left Bank. Mingling actors with passers-by, Bismuth repeats and repeats the same ordinary moments, in which people wait, are met, go about their daily lives. I feel as if I am on that street, walking through a moment of perpetual repetition and slippage, about to meet myself, like Dostoevsky's Double, adrift in Paris. </p> <p>So it is for Graham's shipwrecked sailor, stranded on the beach with a squawking parrot while the surf thunders over the reef. This is RM Ballantyne's Coral Island revisited, but it is also a conundrum, a time-loop that makes us question beginnings and endings and narrative drive. It is a kind of fateful philosophical joke, and I could watch it all day. </p> <p>For rather different reasons, I could also watch Juliao Sarmento's Faces longer than I ought. The camera watches two women, who eventually kiss. Sarmento made the film in 1976; the colour has since decayed into flaring magentas and raw reds, bleach-outs and grainy pulsations. This work belongs with Bismuth and Graham, in that it is about delay, withholding and has a disturbing acuity. Over time, the film has achieved a kind of porno-patina. Although better known as a painter, Sarmento's super-8 films describe the same psychological space as in his paintings. It is important to realise that hierarchies of media have irretrievably broken down. But it doesn't mean that values have ceased to prevail, that anything is as good, or bad, as everything else. </p> <p>This is a great if uneven show. It includes works shown for the first time, including some ill-judged works by Mat Collishaw, along with works such as Jane and Louise Wilson's 1995 Crawl Space, which stands up extremely well.

      "bodyText": "Since the 60s, film and video have become familiar media for artists. Go into any major art school and you'll find as many students working with video cameras as there are chasing oil paint around a canvas with a hairy stick. The suspicion is, of course, that anyone who grew up with TV can make a half-decent video, while painting and sculpture take time, struggle and application. Wrong: making art is a state of mind, never mind the medium. With next week's opening of Tate Modern, London is gearing up for the arrival of the world's big-time museum directors, hot-shot curators and megabucks collectors, and the capital's commercial galleries are pulling out the stops to attract money and attention. The Lisson Gallery has taken over all five floors of a loft-style building in Covent Garden, filling 25,000 square feet of blacked-out emptiness with video and film work by 15 artists. This is the largest and best presented survey of such works ever seen in this country. No institution here - public or private - has ever attempted such an exhibition on this scale, nor cadged the space to do it properly. You wonder why not. The show opens with a come-hither performance, shown on a monitor, staged by Vanessa Beecroft. Beecroft is best known for staging sexy catwalk performances in galleries, and she is providing the first show for the Gagosian Gallery, opening its doors in London next week. Beecroft has a glamorous model go through a routine of cliched poses. The Lisson may as well have employed a professional greeter. But it is a clever opening. Wander into the dark round the corner and there's a naked guy called Rocky, a hollow-chested, weak-kneed pugilist in a rubber mask and boxing gloves, belting himself to a punch-drunk pulp. Muttering, grunting and flailing about, this wretched, one-man orgy of abuse slathers jam over himself between rounds. The camera goes up close and all too personal. His bottom is all gooey and his willy does a miniature can-can as he lunges around. This is ghastly, frightening. This is Paul McCarthy. McCarthy is one of the father-figures of contemporary video art, an inspiration and a stumbling-block for younger artists. Stumbling is the word - Rocky is a cruel, self-punishing and ultimately tragic work about masculinity, so filled with raging impotence and despairing testosterone that it has never been shown since it was made in 1976. A quarter century old, the piece could have been made yesterday, and it makes a lot of current younger British video art look pretty thin. How about some real death, then? Douglas Gordon shows us the big-screen death of a fly. Super-glued to the spot, the fly elicits horror and empathy. Deeper in the darkness, Tony Oursler's giant eyeball is watching TV. You can see the screen reflected in the disembodied eyeball, itself a projection onto a free-standing orb. When the eye blinks, it is like a clam opening and closing. Here, for perhaps the first time in Britain, we begin to get the measure of the medium, and how works, sensibilities, and generations of artists can have a dialogue. There are works which court outrage, are full of humour, which come close to pop-promo video, to pornography, to commercial film and TV. Others can only exist in the terms of the situation for which they were made. A bell tolls on the second floor, the soundtrack to Belgian artist Francis Al\u00ffs's 1997 Cuentos Patri\u00f3ticos (Patriotic Tales), a film of a lone shepherd leading sheep around a flagpole in a public square. With each slow circuit of the pole, another sheep joins the flock. This is a mesmerising and beautiful video, filmed, like many of the artist's works, in Mexico. The shadow cast by the pole never moves, the shepherd follows his own steps exactly, and it slowly becomes apparent that each circuit is the same circuit, all the sheep the same sheep, digitally tweaked into a flock. The pace and enigma are perfect, the politics sly. If You Are a Typical Spectator, What You Are Really Doing is Waiting for the Accident to Happen\" is the title of a second work here by Al\u00ffs. I carry the words with me, a warning to critics everywhere. Further up the building, fog drifts over the sea and over New York, in Igor and Svetlana Kopystiansky's new film, Fog. This is New York weather seen by two artists who left Moscow in the 70s, bringing their Russian lugubriousness with them. The fog rolls in on two screens. Watching one, you can't see the other. You turn and turn again, staring into the lustrous gloom for a break in the weather. A lot of video and film work presents us with the dichotomy between being here - in this space, watching these images - and entering the fictive world presented on the screen. One of the best juxtapositions is the cinema-like presentation and commercial production values of Rodney Graham's Vexation Island (a work better known by reputation and the critical attention it has been given since its Venice Biennale premier in 1997), with Pierre Bismuth's Alternance, which fills a long wall with four abutted projections of a Paris street scene. Alternance almost demands that we walk alongside it, as though we ourselves were in that little square on the Left Bank. Mingling actors with passers-by, Bismuth repeats and repeats the same ordinary moments, in which people wait, are met, go about their daily lives. I feel as if I am on that street, walking through a moment of perpetual repetition and slippage, about to meet myself, like Dostoevsky's Double, adrift in Paris. So it is for Graham's shipwrecked sailor, stranded on the beach with a squawking parrot while the surf thunders over the reef. This is RM Ballantyne's Coral Island revisited, but it is also a conundrum, a time-loop that makes us question beginnings and endings and narrative drive. It is a kind of fateful philosophical joke, and I could watch it all day. For rather different reasons, I could also watch Juliao Sarmento's Faces longer than I ought. The camera watches two women, who eventually kiss. Sarmento made the film in 1976; the colour has since decayed into flaring magentas and raw reds, bleach-outs and grainy pulsations. This work belongs with Bismuth and Graham, in that it is about delay, withholding and has a disturbing acuity. Over time, the film has achieved a kind of porno-patina. Although better known as a painter, Sarmento's super-8 films describe the same psychological space as in his paintings. It is important to realise that hierarchies of media have irretrievably broken down. But it doesn't mean that values have ceased to prevail, that anything is as good, or bad, as everything else. This is a great if uneven show. It includes works shown for the first time, including some ill-judged works by Mat Collishaw, along with works such as Jane and Louise Wilson's 1995 Crawl Space, which stands up extremely well. Flashy new technology guarantees nothing, while the use of the good old film loop, in Jonathan Monk's animation of the images in a catalogue of 100 cubes by Sol LeWitt, reminded me that 70s structuralist film-making really did a lot of the spadework in clearing new territory. It also makes you realise that movies are flicker-books. This is by no means a definitive show, and it certainly isn't a history show - there's no Bruce Nauman, no Warhol, no Vito Acconci - but it is a defining moment. Up on the top floor, there is daylight once again, mirrored walls and the name Bruce Lee in free-standing Hollywood sign lettering. The soundtrack to the movie Enter the Dragon blasts the space. Simon Patterson's installation is about the movies, but it isn't a movie. Carlos Pazos did a much better installation on the theme of stardom, in Valencia, almost a decade ago. History and context matter, I thought, stumbling down the stairs, but so does space, room to breathe and to make your own connections. Who is Bruce Lee anyway? Where's Rocky?

Mr Chamberlain, 52, told the court: \"The closest I could put it is that it looked as if a petrol storage tank had blown up. If you imagine the things you see in films, it was like that - like a large explosion or a bomb - something of that nature.\"</p> <p>At the air traffic control centre, Mr Ford immediately informed search and rescue teams that the aircraft was missing. \"I said to the control there that Clipper 103 has vanished.\"</p> <p>Earlier, the two Libyans, described by the prosecution as intelligence agents, pleaded not guilty to murder, conspiracy to murder and contravention of the Aviation Security Act 1982.

They claim to have been employees of Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta.</p> <p>The defence statement also named Mohammed Abu Talb, a Palestinian, as one of 10 other alleged conspirators. He is serving a life sentence in Sweden for earlier bombings in Denmark and the Netherlands.</p> <p>Abu Talb was an early suspect in the case, but investigators abandoned that line of inquiry. He is listed as one of more than 1,000 prosecution witnesses.</p> <p>Seven other named Arab men, whose whereabouts are unknown, were described as formerly directors of a bakery in Malta,where the suitcase containing the bomb was allegedly loaded on to a feeder flight to Frankfurt, and from there to London.</p> <p>The defence statement referred also to members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and to Parviz Taheri, who is another crown witness.</p> <p>First to testify was Richard Dawson, a civil aviation air traffic controller who was on duty at Heathrow airport on the night the plane crashed in flames on to the Scottish Borders town.</p> <p>Mr Dawson, aged 52, described the routine procedures for departures from Heathrow, and radar control technology which allows the controllers to track the aircraft. He confirmed that the doomed flight made its first appearance in traffic control records at 6.18pm on December 21 1988, identified as Clipper 103, and that later it was cleared for takeoff, leaving the airport shortly afterwards.</p> <p>Watching the trial throughout were the families of the Libyan accused. In total, 17 family members, including the children of the accused, witnessed the first day's proceedings - 10 of Mr Fhimah's relatives and seven of Mr al-Megrahi's. Mr Fhimah's uncle, Milad Fhimah, said: \"We are Muslim, we look to Allah, we believe in God. We are not upset, because it is true that they are innocent.\"</p> <p>Bruce Smith, a former Pan Am pilot whose wife, Ingrid, was killed in the crash, said: \"This is the start of the trial and we welcome it, but there is a long way to go.\"</p> <p>More air traffic control witnesses and police officers who were the first on the scene of the tragedy are expected to give evidence today.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.law.gla.ac.uk/lockerbie/index.cfm\" target=\"_new\">University of Glasgow Lockerbie trial briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.undp.org/missions/libya/lockerbie.htm\" target=\"_new\">Lockerbie trial documents (Libyan site)</a></p>",

Questioned by Colin Boyd, the Lord Advocate, Alan Topp, descirbed how on the night of December 21 1988 he tracked the path of the aircraft on his radar monitor in the Scottish air traffic control centre at Prestwick, as the plane headed from London Heathrow towards New York.

Surrendered In a statement read by the clerk of the court, the defence claimed that members of two Syrian-backed Palestinian groups - one of them a prosecution witness - had planted the bomb on flight 103. The defence was submitted moments after Lord Sutherland opened proceedings against Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, who surrendered for trial last year. They claim to have been employees of Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta. The defence statement also named Mohammed Abu Talb, a Palestinian, as one of 10 other alleged conspirators. He is serving a life sentence in Sweden for earlier bombings in Denmark and the Netherlands. Abu Talb was an early suspect in the case, but investigators abandoned that line of inquiry. He is listed as one of more than 1,000 prosecution witnesses. Seven other named Arab men, whose whereabouts are unknown, were described as formerly directors of a bakery in Malta,where the suitcase containing the bomb was allegedly loaded on to a feeder flight to Frankfurt, and from there to London. The defence statement referred also to members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and to Parviz Taheri, who is another crown witness. First to testify was Richard Dawson, a civil aviation air traffic controller who was on duty at Heathrow airport on the night the plane crashed in flames on to the Scottish Borders town. Mr Dawson, aged 52, described the routine procedures for departures from Heathrow, and radar control technology which allows the controllers to track the aircraft. He confirmed that the doomed flight made its first appearance in traffic control records at 6.18pm on December 21 1988, identified as Clipper 103, and that later it was cleared for takeoff, leaving the airport shortly afterwards. Watching the trial throughout were the families of the Libyan accused. In total, 17 family members, including the children of the accused, witnessed the first day's proceedings - 10 of Mr Fhimah's relatives and seven of Mr al-Megrahi's. Mr Fhimah's uncle, Milad Fhimah, said: \"We are Muslim, we look to Allah, we believe in God. We are not upset, because it is true that they are innocent.\" Bruce Smith, a former Pan Am pilot whose wife, Ingrid, was killed in the crash, said: \"This is the start of the trial and we welcome it, but there is a long way to go.\" More air traffic control witnesses and police officers who were the first on the scene of the tragedy are expected to give evidence today.

It is dismantling border posts and, according to the Foreign Office in London, has stopped military flights in Lebanese airspace.</p> <p>Observers suggested that these developments could be an attempt either to step up the pressure on Syria's ailing president, Hafez al-Assad, or to wrong-foot opponents in Lebanon by withdrawing earlier than expected.</p> <p>The Syrian negotiations have been on hold since President Bill Clinton and President Assad, meeting in Geneva in March, failed to break the impasse.</p> <p>Since then there has been growing concern in the Arab states, and some European capitals, that an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon could lead to more violence unless it was done within the framework of an overall deal with Syria.</p> <p>The involvement of Egypt and Saudi Arabia at this stage appears to be an attempt to present a united Arab front to the Americans and Israelis.</p> <p>The nub of the problem between Israel and Syria - and, by extension, the key to a comprehensive settlement in the region - is a small stretch of shoreline on the north-east corner of the Sea of Galilee.</p> <p>The lake is an important source of water for Israel. Israel's claim to it is based on the border established between Palestine and Syria in 1923, at the time of the League of Nations mandate. This placed the whole of the lake in Palestine, together with a 10-metre strip around the water's edge.</p> <p>Syria points out that Israel, from its establishment in 1948 until the war of 1967, had no access to the north-eastern part of the shore. The Syrians kept fishing boats there and their forces had control in that area, right down to the water's edge.</p> <p>In the 1967 war the Israeli forces drove the Syrians back, occupied the Golan Heights, and gained control of the north-east shore. In the Syrians' view, Israel should withdraw from that part of the shore so as not to derive any benefit from its aggression. President Assad has made this an issue of principle and cannot budge now without serious loss of face.</p> <p>The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Israelis, after occupying the Golan, built a road around the lake. At the failed meeting a Geneva, President Clinton is reported to have proposed extending the 10-metre strip of shoreline to several hundred metres - presumably to allow the Israelis to keep their road.</p> <p>Several solutions have been proposed unofficially, most of them centred on either dual sovereignty or Syrian sovereignty over the north-east shore without actual control.</p> <p>Syria has said it would not use the sovereignty issue to deprive Israel of the water it wants.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Efforts to revive the Syrian track of the Middle East peace process intensified yesterday as the foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia gathered in the Syrian city of Palmyra for two days of talks. Meanwhile Israel pressed ahead with its plans to pull out of Lebanon, with or without a Syrian peace deal. It is dismantling border posts and, according to the Foreign Office in London, has stopped military flights in Lebanese airspace. Observers suggested that these developments could be an attempt either to step up the pressure on Syria's ailing president, Hafez al-Assad, or to wrong-foot opponents in Lebanon by withdrawing earlier than expected. The Syrian negotiations have been on hold since President Bill Clinton and President Assad, meeting in Geneva in March, failed to break the impasse. Since then there has been growing concern in the Arab states, and some European capitals, that an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon could lead to more violence unless it was done within the framework of an overall deal with Syria. The involvement of Egypt and Saudi Arabia at this stage appears to be an attempt to present a united Arab front to the Americans and Israelis. The nub of the problem between Israel and Syria - and, by extension, the key to a comprehensive settlement in the region - is a small stretch of shoreline on the north-east corner of the Sea of Galilee. The lake is an important source of water for Israel. Israel's claim to it is based on the border established between Palestine and Syria in 1923, at the time of the League of Nations mandate. This placed the whole of the lake in Palestine, together with a 10-metre strip around the water's edge. Syria points out that Israel, from its establishment in 1948 until the war of 1967, had no access to the north-eastern part of the shore. The Syrians kept fishing boats there and their forces had control in that area, right down to the water's edge. In the 1967 war the Israeli forces drove the Syrians back, occupied the Golan Heights, and gained control of the north-east shore. In the Syrians' view, Israel should withdraw from that part of the shore so as not to derive any benefit from its aggression. President Assad has made this an issue of principle and cannot budge now without serious loss of face. The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Israelis, after occupying the Golan, built a road around the lake. At the failed meeting a Geneva, President Clinton is reported to have proposed extending the 10-metre strip of shoreline to several hundred metres - presumably to allow the Israelis to keep their road. Several solutions have been proposed unofficially, most of them centred on either dual sovereignty or Syrian sovereignty over the north-east shore without actual control. Syria has said it would not use the sovereignty issue to deprive Israel of the water it wants.",

      "body": "<p>This is a tale of two schools. One is housed in a frayed-at-the-edges concrete and glass affair on the wrong side of the Paris ring road. The other is in a cool and sumptuous old stone building in the heart of the chic sixth arrondissement.</p> <p>The first, the Ecole Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avanc\u00e9es (Epita), is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Its bleary-eyed graduates can choose from dozens of job offers, and half of them start their own companies before they leave.</p> <p>They are not ashamed to say they plan to work a 90-hour week, make their million, and retire at 35. Epita's annual intake has trebled in the past three years.</p> <p>The second, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), is France's most prestigious school. Its graduates include two of the past three presidents, six of the past eight prime ministers, and half the top 17 ministers in the present government. A fast-breeder for bureaucrats, ENA virtually guarantees a job for life in the higher echelons of the civil service.</p> <p>In the past two years, external applicants for the 100 places on offer at ENA - that is, those who are not already high-flying civil servants but are among the best and brightest of France's 20-somethings - have tumbled by a third.</p> <p>It is, of course, unfair to compare the two. They are very different. ENA was founded by Charles de Gaulle in 1945 to be the high church of the technocratic and political classes, a super-elite state finishing school whose graduates would one day rule the country.</p> <p>Epita was launched in 1984 as a computer and telecommunications college, and nearly went bust before the cellphone and internet revolutions finally got a hold on France, where resistance to change has been stiffened by the generations of the ENA graduates who administer it, govern it, and manage its state-run companies.</p> <p>Things are changing. As Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of the utilities and communications firm Vivendi, said: \"At long last, this country is on the move. You can see it. You can almost touch it.\"</p> <p>Statistics back him up. The French economy is expected to expand by 3.5% this year, and its rate of growth has been ahead of those in Germany, Italy and Britain for the past two years. Unemployment is falling, and the CAC 40 stock market index is outperforming New York's Dow Jones.</p> <p>But perhaps more important is a change in mentality, a new perception of what is acceptable and achievable, a shift in young people's priorities. \"Things really are moving,\" Joel Courtois, Epita's director, insisted, looking in on a classroom whose massed ranks of computers were all in use.</p> <p>\"France is surfing on the internet information technology wave, and I don't think it's a passing phase,\" Mr Courtois said. \"A lot of things are suddenly different: it's OK to work enormously hard, to make lots of money, to prefer to be part of an informal team rather than some hierarchical elite. The youngsters at this school have completely outgrown the old French model.\"</p> <p>Pascal Chevalier and Gilles Enguehard belong to the new breed. Recent graduates of Epita, they have formed On-net Services and Planet StartUp, two fast-growing firms providing technical, financial, legal and commercial help to young internet businesses.</p> <p>Barely 30, they now sit on the boards of more companies than they can remember, and for want of space have moved out of Epita's e-business incubator, a suite of offices in a nearby building.</p> <p>\"The thing is, it's just not been part of French culture to start a company, and if you go to the chamber of commerce for advice you never will,\" said Mr Enguehard. \"They'll tell you: take this course, fill in these forms, hire that lawyer, engage this accountant, sort out the social security - it's a nightmare and it's unnecessary.\"</p> <p>To Mr Chevalier, there are now two Frances, moving at different speeds. \"I love the 35 hours,\" he said, referring to the government's recent legislation to limit the working week. \"So much, I do them twice.\"</p> <p>Michel Wolff, 26, a dot.com millionaire, agreed. \"It is a revolution,\" he said. \"In the old France it was who you knew that counted. Now it's how good your idea is, how fast you can put it into action, and how many hours you put in to make it work.\"</p> <p>Students and graduates of ENA do not quite know where that leaves them. This year's intake have demanded sweeping reforms to bring the school into the 21st century, and recent graduates bemoan a decline in interest in what used to be France's highest ideal - serving the state.</p> <p>\"Top minds are not turning to the administration any more as their first choice,\" said one, a civil servant. \"Partly that's to do with a steadily deteriorating public image of the state, partly with the fact that business is now moving so fast - and it doesn't recruit from ENA. Before the new economy, ENA left all your options open. Now it closes a very big one off.\"</p> <p>Another graduate was more damning. \"Yes, France is changing,\" she said. \"ENA is suffering because it is the emblem and the sum of French immobility, and suddenly France is becoming mobile.</p> <p>\"These days, the main satisfaction for the few brilliant students who go to ENA is the contemplation of so much mediocrity around them.\"</p>",

The second, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), is France's most prestigious school. Its graduates include two of the past three presidents, six of the past eight prime ministers, and half the top 17 ministers in the present government. A fast-breeder for bureaucrats, ENA virtually guarantees a job for life in the higher echelons of the civil service. In the past two years, external applicants for the 100 places on offer at ENA - that is, those who are not already high-flying civil servants but are among the best and brightest of France's 20-somethings - have tumbled by a third. It is, of course, unfair to compare the two. They are very different. ENA was founded by Charles de Gaulle in 1945 to be the high church of the technocratic and political classes, a super-elite state finishing school whose graduates would one day rule the country. Epita was launched in 1984 as a computer and telecommunications college, and nearly went bust before the cellphone and internet revolutions finally got a hold on France, where resistance to change has been stiffened by the generations of the ENA graduates who administer it, govern it, and manage its state-run companies. Things are changing. As Jean-Marie Messier, chief executive of the utilities and communications firm Vivendi, said: \"At long last, this country is on the move. You can see it. You can almost touch it.\" Statistics back him up. The French economy is expected to expand by 3.5% this year, and its rate of growth has been ahead of those in Germany, Italy and Britain for the past two years. Unemployment is falling, and the CAC 40 stock market index is outperforming New York's Dow Jones. But perhaps more important is a change in mentality, a new perception of what is acceptable and achievable, a shift in young people's priorities. \"Things really are moving,\" Joel Courtois, Epita's director, insisted, looking in on a classroom whose massed ranks of computers were all in use. \"France is surfing on the internet information technology wave, and I don't think it's a passing phase,\" Mr Courtois said. \"A lot of things are suddenly different: it's OK to work enormously hard, to make lots of money, to prefer to be part of an informal team rather than some hierarchical elite. The youngsters at this school have completely outgrown the old French model.\" Pascal Chevalier and Gilles Enguehard belong to the new breed. Recent graduates of Epita, they have formed On-net Services and Planet StartUp, two fast-growing firms providing technical, financial, legal and commercial help to young internet businesses. Barely 30, they now sit on the boards of more companies than they can remember, and for want of space have moved out of Epita's e-business incubator, a suite of offices in a nearby building. \"The thing is, it's just not been part of French culture to start a company, and if you go to the chamber of commerce for advice you never will,\" said Mr Enguehard. \"They'll tell you: take this course, fill in these forms, hire that lawyer, engage this accountant, sort out the social security - it's a nightmare and it's unnecessary.\" To Mr Chevalier, there are now two Frances, moving at different speeds. \"I love the 35 hours,\" he said, referring to the government's recent legislation to limit the working week. \"So much, I do them twice.\" Michel Wolff, 26, a dot.com millionaire, agreed. \"It is a revolution,\" he said. \"In the old France it was who you knew that counted. Now it's how good your idea is, how fast you can put it into action, and how many hours you put in to make it work.\" Students and graduates of ENA do not quite know where that leaves them. This year's intake have demanded sweeping reforms to bring the school into the 21st century, and recent graduates bemoan a decline in interest in what used to be France's highest ideal - serving the state. \"Top minds are not turning to the administration any more as their first choice,\" said one, a civil servant. \"Partly that's to do with a steadily deteriorating public image of the state, partly with the fact that business is now moving so fast - and it doesn't recruit from ENA. Before the new economy, ENA left all your options open. Now it closes a very big one off.\" Another graduate was more damning. \"Yes, France is changing,\" she said. \"ENA is suffering because it is the emblem and the sum of French immobility, and suddenly France is becoming mobile. \"These days, the main satisfaction for the few brilliant students who go to ENA is the contemplation of so much mediocrity around them.\"",

The explosions caused damage but no injuries. The first, around 3am, went off a stone's throw from the Crazy Horse in central Paris, showering the area with glass. The second, two hours later, caused extensive damage to a casino in Carry-le-Rouet, near Marseille. An hour later a third blast badly damaged a casino in Juan-les-Pins, near Antibes, which belongs to the company which had a casino in Aix-en-Province bombed in March. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the explosions, which came two weeks after a bomb blast at a McDonald's in Brittany, northern France, killed a woman employee. Investigators suspect that the separatist Breton Revolutionary Army was behind the McDonald's bomb. The police questioned at least seven people yesterday in connection with the Brittany bomb - two Basques and five suspected Breton activists. They said they had discovered bomb-making materials in the car of one of those detained. \"As you can see, the authors of these attacks are being actively sought,\" the interior minister, Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement, said. Small groups of Breton separatists have long sought autonomy for the region, which has maintained a strong cultural identity reflecting the Bretons' Celtic origins. The police have suspected links between the Bretons and the Basques in south-west France and Spain since tracking both Basques and Breton separatists to the theft in September of eight tonnes of dynamite in the Breton town of Plevin. Five of the suspects questioned are members of Emgann, a small group believed to be the legal front for the Breton Revolutionary Army, known by its French initials ARB.

The level of this type of crime is unprecedented in the two counties, which have seen a 300% rise in \"distraction burglaries\" since the raids began in January. Such attacks have traditionally been rife in central England, but Devon and Cornwall police believe the conmen have been shunted from the triangle between Bristol, London and Liverpool to the south-west as a result of successful crackdowns from Avon and Somerset and West Midlands forces. The burglaries have led to tragedy. Frances Blyth, an 81-year-old widow, answered the door of her terraced home in Launceston, Cornwall, to two young men claiming to be from the water board. She let them in but within minutes they had helped themselves to \u00a31,000 - the majority of the great-grandmother's life savings - and forced her aside when she began to remonstrate. She collapsed behind the door with a heart attack, and less than 12 hours later she was dead. The outcome has been the most extreme in the series of burglaries. \"We haven't had a significant problem before now, and we think it is a question of their being displaced,\" said Detective Sergeant David Dale, heading the investigation. Certainly the group, whom police believe could number anything from six to 12, now appreciate there are easy pickings to be had in the west country, where coastal towns such as Sidmouth and Torquay have evolved into meccas for people of retirement age. Five or six raids a day have been reported with cash sums of up to \u00a35,000 being taken. \"As soon as the police are called out on one job you get a call from another pensioner a mile up the road - you can virtually trace their route,\" said Mr Dale. \"And, if you can imagine they are sometimes doing this five or six days a week, you can see how skilled they are at this offence.\" The burglars' reasons for targeting the elderly reveal the extent of their cynicism.

      "bodyText": "A \"smart\" cot that can detect the signs leading to cot death has been developed by scientists. The cot can tell what position a baby is lying in, how it is breathing, and warn parents that their baby is in difficulty. The precise cause of sudden infant death syndrome (Sids) is not known but it is believed that changes in breathing and posture can be significant. Tatsuya Harada, of the University of Tokyo, who led the research, said: \"The respiratory movement preceding Sids is still not yet understood.\" Hospitals already have pressure-sensor devices that monitor babies' positions and breathing but these are not suitable for home use. Sensors usually have to be placed on the infant and this restricts their movement, this week's New Scientist reports. The new system, developed by Dr Harada with help from paediatricians at the National Children's hospital in Tokyo, works with pressure sensors under the mattress. By analysing the pressure distribution from these 384 sensors the system determines whether the baby is lying face down or on its back and whether it is quiet, moving or crying. Dr Harada said the other devices based on pressure sensors could only tell whether or not the infant was moving. It is important to be able to recognise the movement of different parts of the body such as the head, abdomen and hips to build up an accurate picture of the infant's breathing and posture. The system has been used with 50 infants under the age of one in preliminary tests designed to extract the algorithms the software needs to interpret data from the pressure sensors. Dr Harada is trying to improve the system by increasing the number of sensors. He said parents would not be able to buy the system for at least three years.",

And 10% of motorists know someone who has been attacked in a car park, the study from the Norwich Union revealed. Three in four drivers prefer parking in an open air car park to a multi-storey one, it emerged. The biggest worries about multi-storeys are dark corners, lack of security patrols and unsafe lifts and stairwells. One in five female drivers fears for her personal safety in multi-storeys and only one in 10 would choose to park in one after dark. The study of more than 500 British motorists showed: one in five drivers do not take any security measures, such as checking for signs of interference, when returning to their cars in a car park; when driving alone at night, five times more motorists feel safer parking on the street than in a multi-storey car park; one third of women have carried a personal attack alarm, compared with just 3% of men.

      "bodyText": "Drug researchers are increasingly heading for the developing world to carry out trials on people with little understanding of their rights, some of whom are left without treatment for the disease under study, critics allege. They fear this practice will go on unchecked because, they suspect, the World Medical Association talks opening today may end up diluting the guidelines under which medical trials are meant to take place. The issue has become highly contentious in the US, where public health doctors are privately agonising over the impossibility of reconciling President Clinton's call to help the millions dying of Aids in Africa with the fact that babies in Uganda and elsewhere have been left by researchers to contract HIV. These are the babies of mothers in the section of a trial group that were not given drugs to stop HIV transmission. Such trials would not have been allowed in the US; in western countries the different test groups in a trial must each be given some form of treatment. In a recent study of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases in Uganda antibiotics were given to half the subjects and nothing to the others. In China, people were deliberately infected with malaria to see whether this reduced the level of HIV infection - another study that would not have been permitted in the US. The ethical battle has split the medical and scientific community, and today's WMA meeting in France is trying to reach a compromise by starting work on a new draft of the Declaration of Helsinki. This contains the guidelines - drawn up between 1953 and 1964, in the light of Nazi medical experimentation - on how doctors should treat patients involved in clinical trials. Public Citizen, the US watchdog leading the protests against the current test regime, says researchers are exploiting woolly wording in the Helsinki document. It says: \"In any medical study, every patient - including those of a control group, if any - should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic method.\" But in the developing world there is often nothing available to give those in the control group. A row about the ethics of trials in the developing world on pregnant women with HIV, which broke out three years ago, led to the decision to rewrite not only the declaration but also the more detailed Cioms (Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences) guidelines, which effectively interpret it. But Peter Lurie and Sidney Wolfe of Public Citizen believe that the institutions are just moving the goalposts: \"Rather than bringing their behaviour in line with the guidelines, they have set about changing the guidelines to conform to their behaviour,\" Dr Lurie said. The controversy was stoked up in March by a study in 10 Ugandan villages to find out whether people who had sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis were more likely to contract HIV. Marcia Angell, editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote of her doubts about publishing the study's findings. \"It meant that for up to 30 months, several hundred people with HIV infection were observed but not treated,\" she wrote. Five villages were supplied with antibiotics to cure any sexually transmitted diseases, but those in the other five got no treatment beyond being advised to go to a government clinic. The effects when it came to HIV were compared. The uproar broke out in 1997, when Dr Lurie and Dr Wolfe denounced as unethical 15 US government-funded HIV studies in developing countries. Researchers wanted to find out if giving low doses of the drug AZT to pregnant women could reduce the chances of the baby being infected. Half the women got the drug, the other half got nothing. In the US they would have been given longer courses of AZT and caesarian sections, and told to breastfeed - techniques known to reduce transmission. Hundreds of infants needlessly contracted HIV, Dr Lurie and Dr Wolfe said. The early stages of drafting new guidelines for the WMA, Cioms and Unaids - the World Health Organisation's Aids organisation - were directed by Robert Levine, a professor at Yale University School of Medicine, who takes the opposite view to the two men. He says that research on what works best and most cheaply in developing countries cannot be done without comparing new drugs with what there is at the moment in such places - that is, no other treatments at all. \"My reaction and that of many other people is that it is all well and good to create something in Uganda that simulates London or New York [by giving various treatments to all the groups in a trial], but what you get out of that is data that is no good anywhere other than London or New York.\" He argues that babies in the AZT trials, for example, would have had to be bottle-fed under the sort of regime they would have in the west. If those arguing for western testing practices in the third world wanted to be coherent and consistent, he said, \"they would have to change the prenatal care programme in the country and clean up the water supply.

Delon Human, secretary general of the WMA, strongly hinted that the changes to the Declaration of Helsinki would be minimal. \"Without any doubt the message from the WMA is that we want as little as possible change to the document and that research participants should be protected and given as much treatment as possible,\" he said. \"For Cioms to do anything radically out of line with that would be unlikely.\"",

But the sky was empty, and there was more to follow. Dozens more blocks of ice fell around Spain in January and February, some weighing up to 6kg. But how can you claim on your insurance when scientists say your story is impossible? </p> <p>Many people assumed the ice falls had to be a hoax. But then, scientists used to dismiss meteorites as a myth. The great French scientist Lavoisier, discover of oxygen, did not think they were worth investigating. \"There are no stones in the heavens,\" he declared, \"therefore it is impossible for stones to fall from the heavens.\" </p> <p>Mysterious ice falls have been recorded for centuries and have generally been ignored. However, in Spain many of them fell over several weeks and more importantly, some were preserved for analysis. It seemed reasonable to assume that the ice falls were a kind of icy meteorite. </p> <p>In 1986, satellite imagery of the upper atmosphere showed dark spots 20 kilometres across which appeared and faded in a few seconds. The general view was that the spots were caused by flaws in the imaging process. Then Louis Frank published a paper theorising that the spots were actually a stream of small comets or ice meteors vaporising in the upper atmosphere. He estimated that the Earth was bombarded by 20,000 house-sized snowballs a day. </p> <p>This claim was not widely accepted, as scientists found it hard to believe that this barrage of meteors could have escaped their attention. However, more recent images have given some support to Frank's theory. It is now generally agreed that not all the spots are instrumental errors, and that something is striking the upper atmosphere - but exactly what, how many and how big are still matters of debate. </p> <p>There is more evidence that ice meteors do exist. In 1996 a probe called Clementine found something unexpected on the moon: water. It was in the form of ice in the long shadows at the lunar poles, the only place where it could survive on the moon. From what we know of lunar geology, the ice can only have come from meteorites or mini-comets. </p> <p>On a theoretical basis, it seemed most likely that the Spanish ice falls were ice meteorites. The biggest problem was understanding how ice could survive the intense heating by friction as it plunged through the atmosphere. When the chunks were analysed, a different story emerged. Traces of atmospheric dust were found, and the balance of isotopes was definitely terrestrial. The ice clearly came from Earth. This raised an entirely new set of questions. </p> <p>Atmospheric ice falls are not particularly exotic: we call them hailstones. They are formed when ice particles are caught in an updraught within a raincloud. Supercooled water vapour condenses on the particles, laying down a new layer of ice. As it gains weight, the particle falls until it is caught by the updraught. The process is repeated and the hailstone gains layers like the growth rings of a tree. The hailstone eventually falls to earth when it is too heavy for the updraught to support. </p> <p>How big can hail get? In Britain we rarely see hailstones more than two centimetres in diameter. In Texas, however, hailstones of 4cm are not uncommon and falls of 7cm hailstones have been recorded. The larger hailstones are not only heavier, they are also faster. It is a case of the bigger they are the harder they fall, which is why Texans prefer not to park outside during the storm season. Cars caught in giant hail are \"waffled\" - covered in small dents from dozens of impacts. </p> <p>The law of physics that makes a bigger hailstone fall faster means that it takes a stronger updraught to keep it in the air. The most extreme air currents within stormclouds could not support a hailstone more than about a kilogram at most. Larger ice masses can form though, as shown by a grisly accident in Germany in 1938. Five glider pilots baled out in bad weather, but were caught in a powerful updraught and carried into a stormcloud. Their bodies became coated in layer after layer of ice, turning them into human hail. Four died, but the fifth, Guy Murchie, survived both the freezing and the fall. The layers of frost may even have cushioned his impact with the ground. </p> <p>The chunks of ice from Spain do not have the characteristic onion layering of hailstones. Instead they consist of a dense mass of small crystals. This suggests that they were not formed inside clouds but higher in the stratosphere where temperatures are much lower. </p> <p>At these altitudes there are jetstreams which can blow at hundreds of miles an hour, perhaps enough to support a large piece of ice if it was aerodynamically shaped. We do not know what the ice chunks looked like before they hit the ground; scientists believe that the pieces recovered are fragments of something larger. A piece of ice in the shape of a teardrop or a flattened disc might remain airborne at high altitude long enough to grow to several kilograms. Such objects would be a formidable hazard to aircraft. </p> <p>It is now accepted that there is a phenomenon to be investigated, but much remains to be discovered. In the past ice falls have been very rare, whereas in Spain there seems to have been an epidemic. A study in Texas showed that giant hailstones are much commoner in hot El Nino years, when air currents are stronger. </p> <p>If ice falls are linked to global warming, then we may be in for some heavy weather indeed - and insurance claims quoting \"damage by unknown phenomenon\" may become routine.</p>",

      "body": "<p> In 1994, Wired magazine ran a cover that showed a couple of famous American ad men of the time, plus the US ad icon, the Pillsbury Doughboy, blindfolded and up against a wall. They were about to be finished off, firing squad style, by a series of TV remote controls. The accompanying blurb asked whether advertising was \"finally dead?\"</p> <p> It went on to ponder whether the age of online interactivity would mean the end for traditional advertising. Fast-forward six years. Now you can't escape from traditional advertising taken out by companies whose business is the internet - either pure internet companies or so-called clicks and mortar operations. </p> <p>The dot.coms fill up the commercial breaks on TV and radio. Buses and taxis inevitably feature a pitch for some new net company on their sides. Your daily newspaper is packed with dot.com ads. If you live in London and go to work on the tube, you'll see a few more. And if you buy sandwiches and coffee, your paper bags and cups may also feature \"ambient\" spots put there by the latest hot new net start-up looking to build brand awareness on a budget. </p> <p>Perhaps the dot.com ads stand out because they weren't around a few years ago. And if you live inLondon, you see a lot more than you would in the rest of the country. \"There are a few high spending dot.coms who are running regional as well as national TV and radio campaigns,\" says Caroline Sceats of net research firm <a href=\"http://www.fletcher.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Fletcher Research</a>. \"However, there isn't anything like the level of spending on outdoor advertising as you see in London.\" </p> <p> That said, figures back up the general impression of a dot.com ad overload. According to Fletcher Research, spending on ads by companies involved in the net has been growing at an exponential rate, increasing four-fold over the past two years. Figures released by AC Nielsen show that in 1998 dot.com companies were spending \u00a341.5m on traditional advertising in the UK. In 1999, that figure more than trebled, with around \u00a3140m being spent in total. </p> <p> \"The advertising industry does see it as a godsend because they were all worried about the impact of the web and thought they were going to lose out,\" says Patrick Burgoyne, editor of the advertising trade magazine, Creative Review. \"In fact, dot.coms have been the most significant source of new business for advertising in years.\" </p> <p> Six years is a long time on the net - an age if you believe the techno-gurus. But even so, there has obviously been a drastic turnaround since that Wired cover. Clearly, the net has woken up to commercial realities and abandoned the anti-ad attitudes it nurtured in the early 90s. More to the point, companies which work on the net have realised two things: first, that to survive they need to build brand identities consumers trust, and second, that traditional advertising is great for brand building. </p> <p>Two or three years ago, dot.coms might have adver tised first on the net. Now, there's a growing scepticism about banner ads on web pages. They're seen as good for tactical campaigns: good, that is, for telling people who are already online about a particular promotion. But they are not so good for building brand awareness, and they are hopeless for reaching out to the mainstream. And that's what the dot.coms want to do. They want to establish themselves as the major players in their chosen areas as quickly as possible, so they gain first mover advantage and squeeze out potential competition. </p> <p> To use the e-commerce jargon, there's a virtual land grab going on, and when it comes to staking a claim, traditional advertising (everything from TV and radio to print and outdoor posters) is seen as crucial. It's out there, in the real world, drilling home a tangible brand image to ordinary people who may not yet be online. Crucially, it gives the impression that you are a serious, reliable company like Coke, Ford, Virgin and all the other big names. It seems reassuring to consumers who are still slightly dubious about the net. That's why big dot.coms and clicks and mortar companies are prepared to spend as much as possible on advertising. </p> <p> The biggest players (Freeserve, Egg and AOL) now spend \u00a310-15m a year on advertising, enough to put them just outside the top 50 companies as far as UK ad budgets are concerned. According to Gordon Macmillan, internet editor at Campaign, everyone else is trying to keep up. \"Typically, you're now seeing annual advertising budgets for a fair sized dot.com of around \u00a35-10m.\" M uch of that money is going on high-profile TV campaigns. Among the more memorable dot.com ads of the last year were the spots produced by Red Handed for the online career agency monster.co.uk. Simon Parker, UK marketing director for Monster, says the company went for TV ads because it \"wanted to be first out there to reach people who were getting to grips with the net\". </p> <p> The ads deliberately aimed for a universal appeal. \"In the early days of establishing a brand, you're trying to be as inclusive as you can. We want to be that kind of brand. We're trying to appeal to people from all walks of life across the country - you have to be universal. As you grow and find out more about your customers, then you can become more targeted.\" Dot.coms using TV advertising is an admission, says Creative Review's Patrick Burgoyne, that \"TV still reaches far wider audiences than the web, and will for some time to come\". However, he argues that it would be sensible for more specialist sites to think carefully before splashing out on commercials. \"With cable and satellite channels, you've got access to a more specialist audience. With general ITV slots, that isn't the case. It doesn't make as much sense spending a lot of money just to hit a very diverse audience, only a very small proportion of which are going to be interested in what you've got to say.\" </p> <p> Indeed, some of the best known dot.coms have yet to advertise on television - lastminute.com, for example (though it could be argued that, given the amount of press it has received, it doesn't need to advertise). Instead, the company has produced a poster campaign, built around the slogan \"do something lastminute.com\". It was also one of a number of dot.coms to try ambient advertising. Lastminute.com put its ad messages on sandwich bags in the capital. Lunchtime is a prime time for internet use, when office workers get to do their own thing on the net. So the thinking was that it would help if the company's ad was on their desk with them, wrapped around their lunch. </p> <p> Other well-known net brands have also eschewed TV in favour of other forms of traditional advertising, in particular outdoor posters. <a href=\"http://www.etoys.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">eToys</a> concentrated on press ads and outdoor sites, says UK marketing manager James Bidwell. \"We had an eToys ad on one in six London buses, which meant that people saw us on the high street. If you're a pure play internet brand, you don't have a shop front, so this was a way of us getting in front of shoppers, when they may not be having such a wonderful experience, in the rain, with lots of queues.\" Both Bidwell and Parker say their campaigns were very effective. Indeed, research from Fletcher Research indicates that big spenders such as Freeserve and Egg have achieved high levels of consumer awareness through traditional advertising. </p> <p> Ad industry insiders are more critical. According to Campaign's Gordon Macmillan: \"A lot of current campaigns miss the mark.\" Last year, dot.com ads were eye-catching because they were new. Now it's getting harder to stand out. Indeed, sometimes, these ads seem to blur into one big commercial for the net in general. It's hard to remember specific sites. To counter that, UK dot.coms may have to imitate their US counterparts. </p> <p> In America, it's not unknown for start-ups to spend half their initial financing on TV ad campaigns. In January, dot.coms queued up to pay $2.2m for 30 seconds of airtime during the Super Bowl. They were following the example of job agency hotjobs.com, which received huge publicity from an ad during the Super Bowl in 1999. The only problem for hotjobs.com was that their ads generated too much traffic - some would-be users had to wait five days to access the site and post their CVs. </p> <p> Many UK dot coms are beginning to devote a similarly large proportion of their revenue to advertising, to the potential detriment of their sites and the experience they offer. It's crucial to find a balance, says Fletcher's Caroline Sceats. \"Dot.coms have to support the ad spending they need to make to grow, even if it's bankrupting them - because they have to attract customers. Their valuations are based on the number of customers they can get and their future value. To have any place in this market, they need to demonstrate they can get customers. Once they get that, they then have to put money into customer service and customer attention, to keep those customers.\" </p> <p> According to Sceats, dot.coms will continue to have to spend highly on traditional advertising for the foreseeable future. As the UK net population increases (Fletcher predicts that 40% of the UK adult population will be online by 2004), so dot.coms will devote more of their ad budgets to online commercials. But the company also predicts that by then, the top 5% of dot.coms will need to spend at least \u00a310m on advertising aimed at building and maintaining their brands. A sizeable share of that will still go on traditional advertising. </p> <p> \"Traditional advertising by the dot.coms won't go away,\" concludes Campaign's Gordon Macmillan. \"These big companies are going to continue to need to build and develop their brands. Advertising is how you do that. If they don't do it, someone will sneak up behind them and take their space.\" </p> <p> <strong>The good, the bad and the hackneyed</strong><br> <strong>Top of the dots</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.Monster.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Monster.co.uk</a><br> A series of glum kids talking about their dead-end future jobs.

      "bodyText": "In 1994, Wired magazine ran a cover that showed a couple of famous American ad men of the time, plus the US ad icon, the Pillsbury Doughboy, blindfolded and up against a wall. They were about to be finished off, firing squad style, by a series of TV remote controls. The accompanying blurb asked whether advertising was \"finally dead?\" It went on to ponder whether the age of online interactivity would mean the end for traditional advertising. Fast-forward six years. Now you can't escape from traditional advertising taken out by companies whose business is the internet - either pure internet companies or so-called clicks and mortar operations. The dot.coms fill up the commercial breaks on TV and radio. Buses and taxis inevitably feature a pitch for some new net company on their sides. Your daily newspaper is packed with dot.com ads. If you live in London and go to work on the tube, you'll see a few more. And if you buy sandwiches and coffee, your paper bags and cups may also feature \"ambient\" spots put there by the latest hot new net start-up looking to build brand awareness on a budget. Perhaps the dot.com ads stand out because they weren't around a few years ago. And if you live inLondon, you see a lot more than you would in the rest of the country. \"There are a few high spending dot.coms who are running regional as well as national TV and radio campaigns,\" says Caroline Sceats of net research firm Fletcher Research. \"However, there isn't anything like the level of spending on outdoor advertising as you see in London.\" That said, figures back up the general impression of a dot.com ad overload. According to Fletcher Research, spending on ads by companies involved in the net has been growing at an exponential rate, increasing four-fold over the past two years. Figures released by AC Nielsen show that in 1998 dot.com companies were spending \u00a341.5m on traditional advertising in the UK. In 1999, that figure more than trebled, with around \u00a3140m being spent in total. \"The advertising industry does see it as a godsend because they were all worried about the impact of the web and thought they were going to lose out,\" says Patrick Burgoyne, editor of the advertising trade magazine, Creative Review. \"In fact, dot.coms have been the most significant source of new business for advertising in years.\" Six years is a long time on the net - an age if you believe the techno-gurus. But even so, there has obviously been a drastic turnaround since that Wired cover. Clearly, the net has woken up to commercial realities and abandoned the anti-ad attitudes it nurtured in the early 90s. More to the point, companies which work on the net have realised two things: first, that to survive they need to build brand identities consumers trust, and second, that traditional advertising is great for brand building. Two or three years ago, dot.coms might have adver tised first on the net. Now, there's a growing scepticism about banner ads on web pages. They're seen as good for tactical campaigns: good, that is, for telling people who are already online about a particular promotion. But they are not so good for building brand awareness, and they are hopeless for reaching out to the mainstream. And that's what the dot.coms want to do. They want to establish themselves as the major players in their chosen areas as quickly as possible, so they gain first mover advantage and squeeze out potential competition. To use the e-commerce jargon, there's a virtual land grab going on, and when it comes to staking a claim, traditional advertising (everything from TV and radio to print and outdoor posters) is seen as crucial. It's out there, in the real world, drilling home a tangible brand image to ordinary people who may not yet be online. Crucially, it gives the impression that you are a serious, reliable company like Coke, Ford, Virgin and all the other big names. It seems reassuring to consumers who are still slightly dubious about the net. That's why big dot.coms and clicks and mortar companies are prepared to spend as much as possible on advertising. The biggest players (Freeserve, Egg and AOL) now spend \u00a310-15m a year on advertising, enough to put them just outside the top 50 companies as far as UK ad budgets are concerned. According to Gordon Macmillan, internet editor at Campaign, everyone else is trying to keep up. \"Typically, you're now seeing annual advertising budgets for a fair sized dot.com of around \u00a35-10m.\" M uch of that money is going on high-profile TV campaigns. Among the more memorable dot.com ads of the last year were the spots produced by Red Handed for the online career agency monster.co.uk. Simon Parker, UK marketing director for Monster, says the company went for TV ads because it \"wanted to be first out there to reach people who were getting to grips with the net\". The ads deliberately aimed for a universal appeal. \"In the early days of establishing a brand, you're trying to be as inclusive as you can. We want to be that kind of brand. We're trying to appeal to people from all walks of life across the country - you have to be universal. As you grow and find out more about your customers, then you can become more targeted.\" Dot.coms using TV advertising is an admission, says Creative Review's Patrick Burgoyne, that \"TV still reaches far wider audiences than the web, and will for some time to come\". However, he argues that it would be sensible for more specialist sites to think carefully before splashing out on commercials. \"With cable and satellite channels, you've got access to a more specialist audience. With general ITV slots, that isn't the case. It doesn't make as much sense spending a lot of money just to hit a very diverse audience, only a very small proportion of which are going to be interested in what you've got to say.\" Indeed, some of the best known dot.coms have yet to advertise on television - lastminute.com, for example (though it could be argued that, given the amount of press it has received, it doesn't need to advertise). Instead, the company has produced a poster campaign, built around the slogan \"do something lastminute.com\". It was also one of a number of dot.coms to try ambient advertising. Lastminute.com put its ad messages on sandwich bags in the capital. Lunchtime is a prime time for internet use, when office workers get to do their own thing on the net. So the thinking was that it would help if the company's ad was on their desk with them, wrapped around their lunch. Other well-known net brands have also eschewed TV in favour of other forms of traditional advertising, in particular outdoor posters. eToys concentrated on press ads and outdoor sites, says UK marketing manager James Bidwell. \"We had an eToys ad on one in six London buses, which meant that people saw us on the high street.

It was the middle of the night on the coast of Scotland and Dr Fletcher, who was about to transport some deer from Jura to a farm in Denmark, had been asleep in his car and was totally naked. </p> <p>These are the lengths to which some will go for the love of deer. Fletcher's obsession began early, as a child of 12. Less interested in the bambi image, and more in what makes them tick, he did his PhD on deer physiology, became a deer vet and now runs a venison farm in Auchtermuchty in Fife. His evangelical attitude towards deer has led not only to a highly interesting life, but to research that suggests that if we are going to eat meat, better deer than cows. </p> <p>Most people who watch what they eat believe white meat is better than red, but venison has only 103 kilocalories per 100 grams, compared with 201 for chicken and 213 for pork. It contains only 1.6g fat whereas chicken has 13.8 and pork 15.2 per 100g. Cholesterol levels are a third lower in venison than skinned chicken, and it has high levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which help the brain to function, \"oil\" joints, and can prevent heart disease. </p> <p>Fletcher believes that our metabolism is used to lean game meat and thus cannot cope with the fat-rich flesh available in supermarkets throughout the Western world. </p> <p>\"Scratch the skin and we are all hunter-gatherers, with the behaviour and physiology of our forebears. Domestication of both animal and plant food sources only took place around 12,000 years ago, so that the consumption of these foods is a novelty,\" he says. \"As for the fatty meats taken from animals bred for fat, they have formed a significant part of our diet for only a few centuries. It is reasonable, therefore, to argue that we have not yet made the necessary physiological adaptations to that fatty diet and may be suffering the consequences.\" </p> <p>The consequences are obesity and coronary attacks. </p> <p>According to Fletcher, deer have been systematically culled as far back as the late Paleolithic and Mesolithic. So many red deer bones have been found at refuse middens dating from this period it would appear that venison was the prime meat source for about 50,000 years in southern Europe. </p> <p>Our ancestors didn't just use the deer for meat. In the midst of East Anglia is a network of neolithic mines where for centuries flint had been quarried. Antlers were used as picks; the mines in East Anglia required roughly 104 antlers a year. Most came from fully mature stags, some were shed yearly by the same stag before he was finally killed. </p> <p>\"It occurred to me that for a large group of mature stags to be retained in one area of woodland, so that their antlers could readily be retrieved, would be extremely difficult without regular feeding,\" says Fletcher. Although there is little direct evidence of deer husbandry, there is reference to deer hunting from Norman times onwards, and during the middle ages, many deer parks were created. The Domesday Survey lists 36 in England though some experts think the actual figure is nearer 2,000 in England and Wales. Henry VIII established deer parks in London in St James's Park in 1532 and in Hyde Park in 1536. He sent Anne Boleyn some of his venison with a note: \"Seyng my darlyng is absent I can no less do than to sende her summe flesche, representyng my name, whyche is hart flesche for Henry, prognosticating that here after, God Wyllyng, you must injoye summe of mine.\" </p> <p> Our ancestors found deer fat useful too. It is not stored within the muscles as in domesticated animals, but in a lump over the haunches and round the kidneys, making it easy to remove. Fletcher believes it would have been a source of tallow for making candles or greasing leather. </p> <p>His initial interest in deer was in their physiology, in particular, the pheromones deer release which indicate their sexual state. </p> <p>He spent a considerable portion of his research time on the island of Rum off the coast of Scotland; a landscape which, according to a description written in 1838, \"exudes melancholia\". Fletcher was trying to identify which scent the stags used to tell whether the hinds were ready to be mated, and so each morning he fed the local deer and while they were eating, sniffed their behinds. Fletcher's predeces sor, Gerald Lincoln, was also fascinated by pheromones. He had the habit of measuring his beard trimmings as a crude way of gauging how high his levels of the male hormone, testosterone, were running. </p> <p>Fletcher says, \"On Rum, in monastic seclusion, he had noticed, no doubt with a certain amount of apprehension, that his beard growth declined, but he had been fascinated, and surely equally relieved, to record a repeatable increase in beard growth associated with the infrequent visits of his lady friends.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, Lincoln's beard grew faster as soon as he knew his girlfriend was coming to stay; so the mind can influence the body well before the body needs to take action. Lincoln's paper on the subject was published anonymously in the science journal, Nature. </p> <p>It was on Rum that Fletcher, who ate his subjects from time to time, realised the health benefits of venison, but also the difficulties of chasing after deer, and establishing any sort of quality control over the meat. He and his wife later set up a deer farm in Auchtermuchty. One of their first ventures rivalled even TV back-to-nature chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's escapades: they invented the Veniburger. </p> <p>The deer for the farm were initially brought over from Rum, although at the time Nickie, Fletcher's wife, was a little sceptical. He had enlisted her help when darting a stag a few weeks before. Once the deer was down, he'd told her: \"Just stand astride him holding his head up by his antlers and if he starts to struggle, apply a little gentle weight with your knees to his shoulders\". The cocktail of chemicals in the dart was not quite right, and a couple of minutes later when Fletcher returned from fetching his equipment, the stag had taken off at breakneck speed with Nickie astride him still clinging to his antlers. </p> <p>\u0095 A Life For Deer: A Deer Vet Tells His Story And Theirs, by John Fletcher.

Once the deer was down, he'd told her: \"Just stand astride him holding his head up by his antlers and if he starts to struggle, apply a little gentle weight with your knees to his shoulders\". The cocktail of chemicals in the dart was not quite right, and a couple of minutes later when Fletcher returned from fetching his equipment, the stag had taken off at breakneck speed with Nickie astride him still clinging to his antlers. \u0095 A Life For Deer: A Deer Vet Tells His Story And Theirs, by John Fletcher.

      "body": "<p><strong> Phone talk</strong><br> One of the handiest mobile phone features is heading for the home phone. Philips is adding its voice recognition system to one of its new range of DECT models - the Zenia Voice. For the phone to dial a number all the user has to do is bark a name (that has already been stored) into its mouthpiece. The phone also features a digital answering machine and, unlike other DECT phones, calls can be made and received via both the handset and the base unit. It goes on sale in early summer for \u00a3200. </p> <p>Philips has also unveiled a quartet of new mobile phones. Targeted at business users is its Wap (Wireless application protocol) version of its super-slim Xenium phone. The new upmarket model employs voice recognition technology that enables the user to dial and navigate through the phone's menu system by speaking. </p> <p>Also available is a lower specified version of the Xenium, the Xenium DB, and two phones targeted at the youth market: the Ozeo, which comes in a range of metallic colours, and the Savvy Vogue. </p> <p><strong> Record this</strong><br> Want to be the first on your block with a DVD recorder? If you can't wait until the end of the year for the official UK launch then check out <a href=\"http://www.ionark.com\">www.ionark.com</a>. This British-based website is offering the Pioneer DVR-1000 for a penny short of \u00a32,000. </p> <p>Ionark is hoping to make a name for itself selling ultra-desirable Japanese/American gadgets bought directly from the manufacturer and approved for the UK market. Its current best seller is the \u00a3300 Apex AD-600A, a DVD player that not only plays British and American discs, but can also bypass the Macrovision copyright protection system, enabling the user to record copies of their DVDs on to VHS. </p> <p>Also on sale is Sony's PlayStation 2 (\u00a3500) and the tiny Hyper-Hyde MP3 player - see below. (AN)</p> <p><strong> Think thinner</strong><br> IBM has simplified its line-up of ThinkPad notebook PCs by launching two new ranges designated A (for All-in-one machines) and T (for Travel). Both are thinner, lighter and more powerful than earlier models and have other benefits such as common port replicators and docking stations for use in the office. All the new machines also have an Ultraport slot in the lid to take a small camera. But you probably won't be able to buy a new A20 or T20. IBM says it has no plans to offer the machines to retailers: they are for sale to corporate clients. </p> <p><strong> Music to go</strong><br> It may be taking the idea of \"male jewelry\" a step too far, but the Hyper-Hyde MP3 music player/voice recorder is so small it could be worn as a necklace. However, a dual memory card slot means it can store up to four hours of music in 128 megabytes of memory, though only 32 megs are supplied as standard. The \u00a3140 Hyper-Hyde also has a built in microphone, and is said to run for more than 10 hours on one AAA battery. For further details, phone 0870 241 2461 or see <a href=\"http://www.ionark.com\">www.ionark.com</a>. </p> <p> But next week, Antenna, a British company, plans to launch another item of \"audio jewelry\", the X-plorerT, which it claims \"the smallest, lightest, most sophisticated and powerful MP3 player in the world\". Antenna provides audio programmes for museums, galleries and other tourist attractions, and the X-plorerT will be used to provide visitors to the Whitney Museum of Art in New York and the new Gilbert Collection in Somerset House, London, with audio commentaries. </p> <p><strong> Strong seller</strong><br> Little eMachines, which sells $500 PCs, has stormed past ageing giants Apple and IBM to become the fifth largest US supplier, as measured by the number of computers sold in the year's first quarter. It shipped more than 500,000 PCs (83% more than t last year), according to market research by International Data Corporation. </p> <p>The two-year old company received a huge amount of free publicity when Apple sued it for making a machine that looked somewhat like an iMac. Hewlett-Packard, in third place behind Dell and Compaq, also did well, increasing its US shipments by 67% to 1.4m units. HP and eMachines benefited after IBM's loss-making PC company and Packard Bell withdrew from the tough US retail PC market. </p> <p><strong> Voice online</strong><br> Voizmail has launched a website that works as an answerphone. Anyone with a suitable web browser and a microphone can leave a five-minute message at <a href=\"http://www.voizmail.com\">www.voizmail.com</a> for someone else to listen to, via their computer's loudspeakers, up to 30 times. People are sent email messages to let them know they have voicemail to collect, but not huge audio files that might clog up their mailboxes. The email contains only a link to the website, a much less intrusive way of working. </p> <p>Even people who hate talking to answerphones can still use the Voizmail system, because it offers a number of pre-recorded messages - an idea that could stimulate the use and abuse in the future. (JS)</p> <p><strong> Wap a relief</strong><br> At last a Wap site that's convenient. Some inventive folks at Nykris digital design have announced an application for much-hyped wireless application protocol handsets which might even be useful - a guide to London loos. </p> <p>Subscribers who are caught short in London can dial in to the website at <a href=\"http://www.nykris.com/wap\">www.nykris.com/wap</a>, where they will find a guide to city-centre loos, complete with little maps, like the one pictured below, to help you get there pronto.

      "body": "<p>OK, so Bill Gates might have lost billions of dollars in shares and may face the prospect of seeing his beloved Empire torn in two. But on May 13 he's sure to have plenty to smile about. For like Abba, Buck's Fizz and Katrina and the Waves, Gates is set to become a Eurovision winner. </p> <p>It could be Congratulations time for Mr Microsoft as MSN's internet sites try to smash the record for the number of viewers for a live video webcast with their coverage of the Eurovision song contest. </p> <p>MSN already holds top spot courtesy of Sir Paul McCartney's Return to the Cavern gig in December 1999, which pulled in three million net-heads. Next Saturday's event is likely to attract even more viewers. Not only are all 18 European MSN sites offering the contest in local languages but viewers from the US, Canada and Australia will also be able to watch the contest via MSN's Windows Media Channel sites. </p> <p>The company is also getting into to the spirit of things by offering polls on worst haircut, silliest costume and most disastrous dance routine. Net viewers will be asked to vote for their favourite tunes and at the end of the evening the websites will announce the web winner. There will be different camera angles for viewers to choose, and interviews with some performers back stage. Completing the coverage is a chat room where Eurovision anoraks can discuss the big issues like the similarities between the Spice Girls and the German entry. </p> <p>It all sounds a bit of hoot, but, as Microsoft's consumer marketing manager Sharon Baylay explains, the company is taking it very, very seriously. </p> <p>\"Eurovision is a big night for us as we are hoping to pull in lots of people who have never tried an internet experience like this before.\" </p> <p>Over the past few months, MSN has screened a variety of music shows (last week Oasis fans were offered the chance to see their favourite band live) and has big plans for the future. One reason why MSN is so keen on webcasts is that they give the internet sites a very high profile, yet the site owners invariably pay little or no money for the rights. </p> <p>\"It's a mutually beneficial arrangement,\" says MSN's special events producer Niall MacAnna. \"A band like Oasis is offering us great programming, because they know we have the kind of worldwide reach they can't really get elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Great things have been predicted for the video webcast, but it's still in its infancy. Many people's experience of webcasts are of blocky images that often freeze.

      "bodyText": "OK, so Bill Gates might have lost billions of dollars in shares and may face the prospect of seeing his beloved Empire torn in two. But on May 13 he's sure to have plenty to smile about. For like Abba, Buck's Fizz and Katrina and the Waves, Gates is set to become a Eurovision winner. It could be Congratulations time for Mr Microsoft as MSN's internet sites try to smash the record for the number of viewers for a live video webcast with their coverage of the Eurovision song contest. MSN already holds top spot courtesy of Sir Paul McCartney's Return to the Cavern gig in December 1999, which pulled in three million net-heads. Next Saturday's event is likely to attract even more viewers. Not only are all 18 European MSN sites offering the contest in local languages but viewers from the US, Canada and Australia will also be able to watch the contest via MSN's Windows Media Channel sites. The company is also getting into to the spirit of things by offering polls on worst haircut, silliest costume and most disastrous dance routine. Net viewers will be asked to vote for their favourite tunes and at the end of the evening the websites will announce the web winner. There will be different camera angles for viewers to choose, and interviews with some performers back stage. Completing the coverage is a chat room where Eurovision anoraks can discuss the big issues like the similarities between the Spice Girls and the German entry. It all sounds a bit of hoot, but, as Microsoft's consumer marketing manager Sharon Baylay explains, the company is taking it very, very seriously. \"Eurovision is a big night for us as we are hoping to pull in lots of people who have never tried an internet experience like this before.\" Over the past few months, MSN has screened a variety of music shows (last week Oasis fans were offered the chance to see their favourite band live) and has big plans for the future. One reason why MSN is so keen on webcasts is that they give the internet sites a very high profile, yet the site owners invariably pay little or no money for the rights. \"It's a mutually beneficial arrangement,\" says MSN's special events producer Niall MacAnna. \"A band like Oasis is offering us great programming, because they know we have the kind of worldwide reach they can't really get elsewhere.\" Great things have been predicted for the video webcast, but it's still in its infancy. Many people's experience of webcasts are of blocky images that often freeze. MacAnna acknowledges that some PC owners have equipment that won't allow them to get too much of a view, but has an ace up his sleeve. From now on MSN's webcasts will not only be offered at the standard rate of 56Kbps, but also in a \"broadband\" option of 300Kbps so the fortunate few get to see top quality images. Once broadband is established, MSN believes video webcasts could become very big business indeed.

Both Uefa and Fifa are working out how they are going to distribute internet rights for big events and they are in discussions with everyone from large broadcasters like the BBC to internet sites and mobile phone networks.

      "body": "<p><strong> Angry grrls</strong><br> Many people have read with dismay Anne Hyland's article about the Webgrrls (Online, April 27). For those at the meeting - for which there are transcripts - it all went rather differently. </p> <p>Everyone reading the article will question a female writer who takes up a whole column to talk about a stray, rude man (there were actually two men at the meeting), using emotive language - \"hijacked by an intelligent and eager young man\", and incorrect English - \"their male-exclusive networking meeting\"! </p> <p>The article gave Webgrrls some good coverage, but Hyland used jumped-up drama, leaving Webgrrls baffled at the description of themselves as women who \"glare\" and \"become silent\" in the presence of men. There's nothing like a good angle, but this is going too far, and proves that Webgrrls should retain its \"female-exclusive\" stance. <br> <strong> Lynn Robson</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:lynn@frognation.com\">lynn@frognation.com</a> </p> <p> Your article Meet The Digital Divas contained many inaccuracies and, I feel, portrayed Webgrrls in a negative light. Far too much emphasis was placed on the behaviour of our ignorant interloper, to the detriment of the actual aims and objectives of our organisation. If you would like to include some more factual information in a future article, any of the committee members would be happy to oblige. <br> <strong> Catherine Pope</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:caterinep@iii.co.uk\">caterinep@iii.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Faking it</strong><br> I have to take issue with two items in last week's Online (April 27). First, Nik Kraakenes letter about Online Caroline not being the first to make use of a \"fake\" web cam. He's quite right, and he accuses Freeserve of being behind with the game, but what he fails to understand is that on the internet - as in many areas of real life - being first is not what matters. Being first to draw something to the public's attention and getting all the publicity is more important. </p> <p>Sure, it's nice to be first, but it's even better to be second and get all the publicity, web hits and possible funding from the publicity. </p> <p>Second, the article on Webgrrls was very interesting but if I, or any other male, set up a group with a name like \"weblokes\" (or something equally silly) and said \"no chicks please\", we would be accused of being discriminatory. But when women do it, it's fair enough. Looks like sexual discrimination in cyberspace to me.<br> <strong> Craig McGill</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:craig@its-a-secret.demon.co.uk\">craig@its-a-secret.demon.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Secret's out</strong><br> Electronic voting and true online ballots offer far more opportunity for fraud (Click the vote, April 27). With traditional polling stations in relatively few locations, a proportion of the electorate can be asked outside the premises how they voted in independent counts, thereby providing a chance of identifying widely differing, autonomous and official figures. No such opportunity exists with predominantly home voting. </p> <p>But far more alarming is businesses taking charge of ballot counting.

      "bodyText": "Angry grrls Many people have read with dismay Anne Hyland's article about the Webgrrls (Online, April 27). For those at the meeting - for which there are transcripts - it all went rather differently. Everyone reading the article will question a female writer who takes up a whole column to talk about a stray, rude man (there were actually two men at the meeting), using emotive language - \"hijacked by an intelligent and eager young man\", and incorrect English - \"their male-exclusive networking meeting\"! The article gave Webgrrls some good coverage, but Hyland used jumped-up drama, leaving Webgrrls baffled at the description of themselves as women who \"glare\" and \"become silent\" in the presence of men. There's nothing like a good angle, but this is going too far, and proves that Webgrrls should retain its \"female-exclusive\" stance. Lynn Robson lynn@frognation.com Your article Meet The Digital Divas contained many inaccuracies and, I feel, portrayed Webgrrls in a negative light. Far too much emphasis was placed on the behaviour of our ignorant interloper, to the detriment of the actual aims and objectives of our organisation. If you would like to include some more factual information in a future article, any of the committee members would be happy to oblige. Catherine Pope caterinep@iii.co.uk Faking it I have to take issue with two items in last week's Online (April 27). First, Nik Kraakenes letter about Online Caroline not being the first to make use of a \"fake\" web cam. He's quite right, and he accuses Freeserve of being behind with the game, but what he fails to understand is that on the internet - as in many areas of real life - being first is not what matters. Being first to draw something to the public's attention and getting all the publicity is more important. Sure, it's nice to be first, but it's even better to be second and get all the publicity, web hits and possible funding from the publicity. Second, the article on Webgrrls was very interesting but if I, or any other male, set up a group with a name like \"weblokes\" (or something equally silly) and said \"no chicks please\", we would be accused of being discriminatory. But when women do it, it's fair enough. Looks like sexual discrimination in cyberspace to me. Craig McGill craig@its-a-secret.demon.co.uk Secret's out Electronic voting and true online ballots offer far more opportunity for fraud (Click the vote, April 27). With traditional polling stations in relatively few locations, a proportion of the electorate can be asked outside the premises how they voted in independent counts, thereby providing a chance of identifying widely differing, autonomous and official figures. No such opportunity exists with predominantly home voting. But far more alarming is businesses taking charge of ballot counting. Their owners are in it for personal gain, and therefore can never be relied upon to remain politically neutral. For example, what if the little-known Socialist Party of Great Britain had a real chance of winning a general election? Their genuine socialism objective could mean ballot-counting company bosses losing very privileged lifestyles. The temptation to magic in and away digital data, with little prospect of discovery, could be considerable. The then government may quietly encourage this due to there being \"a threat to national security\", or some other such justification, necessitating ballot tampering \"for the sake of the nation\". To counter this, concerned electors with no objection could have their names, addresses and chosen candidates published on a website. If direct political material from other parties isn't wanted, a simple \"No communication\" marker could be included. Secret digital ballots facilitate secret abuses of power. Max Hess max@truesocialism.freeserve.co.uk Interesting as it was, Patrick Barnham's article ignored the wider contexts beyond the virtual polling booth. More convenient ways of voting may have some short-term effect on turn-out, but technological exclusion and political indifference are far more pressing issues. And if e-voting is to have any lasting impact, it has to be emphasised as a mere activity within a culture of e-participation and, indeed, \"politeracy\". Perhaps then, we can begin to champion the democratic virtues of the virtual world.

      "body": "<p>It would not be right to say that I bought a grand piano off the internet. But without the internet it's fair to say that I woudn't now have a gleaming new seven foot concert grand in the middle of my sitting room. </p> <p>It began with my piano teacher, Michael Shak, saying he'd just had an hour playing the best piano he'd ever come across in his life. Not a Steinway, not a Bosendorfer, but a Fazioli. No, he'd never heard of it either. Hand-made. Italian. Gorgeous. </p> <p>At home I tried Fazioli out on Google, which took me to <a href=\"http://www.telenia.it/fazioli/\">www.telenia.it/fazioli</a>, a pretty impressive hand-made Italian website devoted to the aforesaid gorgeous instruments. The appetite duly whetted, I wandered off to <a href=\"http://www.pianomart.com/grand.htm\">www.pianomart.com/grand.htm</a>, a site devoted to the sale of second hand pianos. There I found a man in Crouch End with a Fazioli for sale. </p> <p>He turned out to be a proper pianist, Mark Swartzentruber, who is playing at the Wigmore Hall, London, next Sunday, May 7. Not on his Fazioli, since by the time I had made it across to Crouch End he had sold his piano to Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. But not before I had half an hour on it and, like my teacher, had fallen in love. </p> <p>Mark knew a dealer... the dealer had a website... one thing led to another... and pretty soon I had a large overdraft and piano to match. One more illustration of how surfing can seriously damage your wallet. </p> <p>It is also so fatally easy. No traipsing around on tubes, buses and taxis in search of this CD or that piece of sheet music. The frustrations are momentary. If website x does not have the particular recording or edition you're after, website y is but one easy and expensive click away. </p> <p>Thus, <a href=\"http://www.cdnow.com\">CD Now</a> was the place to go for Nozze Istriane, an obscure opera by A Smareglia for which a colleague had forlornly searched for most of his life. But it drew a blank when asked for the first volume of Angela Hewitt's Well-tempered Clavier. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">Amazon</a> managed that, but not Smareglia. </p> <p>Then there's sheet music. <a href=\"http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/\">Sheetmusicplus</a> claims to have 304,849 titles in stock compared with 50,000 in the largest wholesalers and 10,000 in your average major city music shop. I searched for versions of the Brahms clarinet sonatas and was offered them in editions by Peters, Henle, Dover, Boosey, Schauer, Ricordi and Warner Bros, which is not a bad choice. </p> <p>It was also the only site to succeed with a modestly known French composer of jazz piano studies, Charles-Henry. That was another \u00a360 out of the wallet. The site is American-based, but if you're prepared to pay another a few dollars for air mail, delivery can be speeded up to two to four days. </p> <p>I've yet to find any British outlet that can rival this site for sheer range of stock. Some people swear by a site called <a href=\"http://www.net4music.com\">www.net4music.com</a>, but so far it has defeated every attempt to buy anything off it. There is also a more modest choice of music (and some free sheet music) at <a href=\"http://www.sheetmusic1.com\">www.sheetmusic1.com</a>. This has within it a useful sub-address for composers : <a href=\"http://www.sheetmusic1.com/Grand.Staff.NOBARLINES.pdf\">www.sheetmusic1.com/Grand.Staff.NOBARLINES.pdf</a> It is nothing but plain manuscript paper. </p> <p>The web is, of course, an adventure playground for anoraks of all sorts - musical as well as techie. Whatever your instrument, you will be able to commune with people all over the world whose sole obsession is the piccolo or Oboe D'Amore. </p> <p>I dabble in the clarinet. It is possible to dabble on the net, but not for long. Soon you find yourself drawn deeper and deeper into other peoples' obsessions. <a href=\"http://www.sneezy.org/clarinet/\">www.sneezy.org/clarinet</a> is a very good general clarinet site, which at a single click will take you to similar sites around the world: the Peruvian and Japanese clarinet societies, to name but two. Another comprehensive site full of links is at <a href=\"http://www.clarinet.org/Links/\">www.clarinet.org/Links</a>.</p> <p> Soon you are down rabbit warrens checking the serial numbers of your instruments to discover the year of manufacture or looking for tips on repair and maintenance. <a href=\"http://www.woodwind-shop.com/\">www.woodwind-shop.com/clarinetcare.html</a>. Only by the greatest strength of character did I resist purchasing a battery-operated portable woodwind leak detector for $89.60. </p> <p>Listening to music on the internet is clearly going to be a huge industry, but I feel slightly defeated by it at the moment. A good starting point is Radio Three's website <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/index.shtml\">www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/index.shtml</a>, where you can listen to much of the station's daily output. </p> <p>The site also links to <a href=\"http://classicalwebcast.com\" target=\"_new\"> http://classicalwebcast.com</a>, which is a compendium of classical music sites around the world. So if Radio Three is playing some dull Albeniz you can tune into Croatia, Holland, Canada, Australia or Pittsburgh to see if there's something more interesting. </p> <p>If you're looking for a specific piece of music, there seems to be endless sites devoted to electronically-synthesised versions of a wide repertoire. There is an enormous stock of music at <a href=\"http://www.prs.net/midi.html\">www.prs.net/midi.html</a> - though there may be a limited audience for, say, Beethoven op 110 played by a computer. </p> <p>Still, it is a wonderful education resource for music students. By logging in at <a href=\"http://www.gmn.com/classical/\">www.gmn.com/classical</a> you can allegedly hear John Lill playing op 110, which is more to my taste. But so far I have failed to download anything from this site. </p> <p>Dabbling at the net can be as frustrating as dabbling at the clarinet. </p> <p> More frustrations: Father Christmas bought me a CD-writer to see if there was any - strictly legal - way of capturing any of this ocean of classical music to listen to in the car later. The plan was also to transfer a lot of vinyl recordings to CD. I unsuccessfully wrestled with it for a month before discovering that it wasn't compatible with Macs. The replacement model has also defeated me. So I am also the wrong person to be writing about the miracle of MP3. </p> <p>The rest of the Radio Three site is a trifle rudimentary, given the archival possibilities. You can check the three-year backlist of Building A Library and there are the modest beginnings of an educational site. But perhaps the most useful thing on the site is its comprehensive list of links at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/\">www.bbc.co.uk/webguide/arts-culture/classical_music.shtml</a>. </p> <p> This will, for instance, take you to The Mozart Project at <a href=\"http://www.frontiernet.net/\">www.frontiernet.net/~sboerner/mozart/index.html</a> or the best instrument jokes at <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu/\">www.mit.edu/~jcb/jokes</a> or the cornucopia of the classical music webring at <a href=\"http://www.webring.\">www.webring.org/cgi-bin/webring?ring=classicalring&amp;id=1&amp;list</a>. </p> <p> The web will change everything about the music industry, just as it will change most industries.
