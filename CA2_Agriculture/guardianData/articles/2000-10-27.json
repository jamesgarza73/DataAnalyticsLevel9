In a split second of blind panic, the Leeds goalkeeper shuddered in disbelief. </p> <p>\"He came up and shook my hand before moving on to the next man,\" says Robinson. \"I just thought to myself 'That was Rivaldo. He's the World Footballer of the Year. What the hell am I doing here?'\" </p> <p>Robinson could be forgiven his brief flurry of nerves. After all, the latest bright young thing to spring into the limelight in West Yorkshire was a veteran of just five first-team appearances when he stumbled off the bench to replace the injured Nigel Martyn against Charlton a fortnight ago. Since then he has kept a Champions League clean sheet in Istanbul, spared Leeds a hammering at Old Trafford and so nearly knocked Rivaldo off his perch. </p> <p>With his manager David O'Leary's words no doubt still ringing in his ears - \"Paul will go on to play for England\" - the 21-year-old will open negotiations tomorrow with the Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale over a new five-year contract, with wages to match. Then comes the small matter of attempting to ruin Stan Collymore's big day at Valley Parade. All in all, it has been a whirlwind two weeks. </p> <p>\"It's slowly sinking in,\" he says. \"I'm just trying to do my job and fill a hole. Nigel was running around the pitch this morning and that's good news for the club.\" He pauses before adding with a smile: \"But I think he'll be a few weeks away yet.\" </p> <p>Robinson is clearly relishing his chance to impress. Bolstered by some fine displays for the England under-21s, he made a mockery of his tender age by shutting out Besiktas on Leeds's emotional return to Turkey. At Old Trafford last week it was his acrobatics that kept heads up and the score down, while against Barcelona on Tuesday Robinson's virtuoso display pushed the Catalans to the brink of elimination from the Champions League. </p> <p>Rivaldo, his reputation long forgotten, was thwarted with a quartet of stunning saves; Alfonso sunk to his knees in frustration after seeing his point-blank header clawed away. Then, four minutes into injury-time, Gerard struck a post and up popped the Brazilian to condemn Robinson to another nail-biting European night at the San Siro in 10 days. </p> <p>\"When you're in a game like that with that kind of atmosphere you just don't have time to think 'Jesus, that's Rivaldo charging towards me',\" he says. </p> <p>\"You just have to save the thing that's flying at you. That's what I did. It was a pleasing performance, but after the game it felt like a defeat. I honestly believed that it was going to be our night. But we're still in it and are more than capable of doing well in Milan. They are already through and the San Siro will be incredible.\" </p> <p>Regardless of how he performs on such a lofty stage, Robinson is aware that once the England No2 has regained his fitness he will return to his former role of understanding understudy. He remains philosophical over playing second fiddle to a goalkeeper of Martyn's ability - and fitness. </p> <p>\"When you have been sat on the bench for so long you do start wondering if your chance will ever come,\" he says. \"You get nervous contemplating whether you'll get on or not. And then your chance comes along and there are doubts. You have to be strong-minded. </p> <p>\"Last year was frustrating. I was down quite a few times and my girlfriend Rebecca took the brunt of it.

      "body": "<p>In studying the history of Sheffield, the world's oldest football club of any code, you can skip over most of the 1900s. This century, though, already looks more promising. </p> <p>Sheffield, who play in the Northern Counties East League, began this season with 10 successive wins. They have already won five FA Cup matches this season, which is more than they won in the first 53 years of the last century. And if they can win again today at Bramall Lane against Northwich Victoria, the oldest club in the Conference, they will be in the first round of the Cup for the first time since the qualifying competition was introduced in 1888. </p> <p>\"Success has bred success,\" says their joint team manager John Pearson, the former Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday striker. \"And it's a good habit to have.\" </p> <p>Sheffield held their 143rd anniversary dinner this week, a celebration that should have caused a little queasiness in Australia. Sheffield were founded on October 24 1857, at a meeting in a Heeley greenhouse called by two army officers stationed at Hillsborough barracks. The Melbourne Football Club, which Professor Geoffrey Blainey and others have claimed as the world's oldest, was set up the following year. \"Are you going to give him the bad news or am I?\" says Sheffield's chairman Richard Tims. </p> <p>Sheffield teams played to rules very similar to Melbourne's, but various accommodations were reached with the Football Association. The Sheffield club first appeared in the Cup in its third edition, in October 1873, when they drew 0-0 with Shropshire Wanderers. Northwich, founded the following year, debuted in 1883 with a 1-0 win over Druids. </p> <p>These clubs are so old they were playing before there were referees, leagues or crossbars.

      "bodyText": "In studying the history of Sheffield, the world's oldest football club of any code, you can skip over most of the 1900s. This century, though, already looks more promising. Sheffield, who play in the Northern Counties East League, began this season with 10 successive wins. They have already won five FA Cup matches this season, which is more than they won in the first 53 years of the last century. And if they can win again today at Bramall Lane against Northwich Victoria, the oldest club in the Conference, they will be in the first round of the Cup for the first time since the qualifying competition was introduced in 1888. \"Success has bred success,\" says their joint team manager John Pearson, the former Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday striker. \"And it's a good habit to have.\" Sheffield held their 143rd anniversary dinner this week, a celebration that should have caused a little queasiness in Australia. Sheffield were founded on October 24 1857, at a meeting in a Heeley greenhouse called by two army officers stationed at Hillsborough barracks. The Melbourne Football Club, which Professor Geoffrey Blainey and others have claimed as the world's oldest, was set up the following year. \"Are you going to give him the bad news or am I?\" says Sheffield's chairman Richard Tims. Sheffield teams played to rules very similar to Melbourne's, but various accommodations were reached with the Football Association. The Sheffield club first appeared in the Cup in its third edition, in October 1873, when they drew 0-0 with Shropshire Wanderers. Northwich, founded the following year, debuted in 1883 with a 1-0 win over Druids. These clubs are so old they were playing before there were referees, leagues or crossbars. Between them they have reached the Cup quarter-finals on four occasions - all before professionalism was legalised. Sheffield won the Amateur Cup in 1904, beating Ealing Association 3-1 at Valley Parade. They reached the FA Vase final in 1977, losing out to Billericay. In between there were some fallow years, including a run of 24 Cup defeats in 25 ties and humiliations at the hands of Brodsworth Main Colliery (9-0), Atlas and Norfolk Works (6-0) and Treeton Reading Room (4-1). When Pearson took over, he and the club were close to despair. He was injured and unable to find a club that would employ him. Sheffield were bottom of the table and playing at Owlerton stadium on a pitch so tight that players were forced to back up on the dog track to take corners. It was January and they had only six points. Relegation was escaped on the last day of the season. Next month, if the new stand and floodlights can be completed, they will move out of the Don Valley stadium to the Coach and Horses in Dronfield, a pub with an attached ground in a town of about 27,000 south of the city and, indeed, south of the county, in Derbyshire. Tims and his fellow directors have put up the money to buy the ground and the pub. \"The idea is to capture 27,000 people,\" Tims says. \"It's back to grassroots football: a pie, a pint and a game and all back home in time for tea.\" Sheffield's public may be ready for a success story.

      "bodyText": "The Premiership may be a fortnight away from discovering what it is really like to be competing for attention with a European league. Already there have been plenty of hints but when the draw for the second group phase of the Champions League is made on Friday week reality may dawn. This is because there is a distinct possibility that Arsenal, Manchester United and Leeds could all be going into a draw which will involve them in regular European activity until mid-March and maybe beyond. Arsenal are already through and Leeds need just a point in the San Siro against Milan, who have also qualified, to join them. United have to beat Dynamo Kiev, who cannot qualify, at Old Trafford to progress. For the Premiership the prospect of increasingly playing second fiddle to English interests in the Champions League is not a happy one. Already the domestic championship is starting to look like a straight fight between United and Arsenal, who both have shown that they can rest important players for Europe and still win routine domestic games. The match at Old Trafford last Saturday morning could be the regular shape of things to come. Both United and Leeds faced crucial Champions League matches 72 hours later with the result that a fixture which is normally one of the showpieces of the Premiership's season was well populated with spear-carriers. Sir Alex Ferguson left Ryan Giggs and Andy Cole on the bench and brought on David Beckham only after Roy Keane had been injured. David O'Leary counted Ian Harte, Olivier Dacourt, Eirik Bakke and Danny Mills among his many casualties but all played against Barcelona on Tuesday night. Given the fact that each club reaching the next round of the Champions League stands to gain an extra \u00a38m it is difficult to argue with such priorities. At the same time the Premiership's status as the most intensely competitive, though not the most technically accomplished, league in the world will be called into question if it continues to be won by teams who increasingly reserve their fuller strengths for a more rewarding competition. Should Uefa ever bend to the will of its major clubs and, by implication, the leading television companies and accept the formation of a TV-oriented European league it will be a bad day for the Premiership and its equivalents in Italy, Spain, France, Germany and so on. For as Joan Gaspart, the president of Barcelona, said before this week's game at Elland Road: \"Leeds against Barcelona is very important but I'm not sure it's more important than Leeds against Liverpool, Leeds against Manchester United or Leeds against Arsenal.\" Last Saturday night the scenes at the Nou Camp proved Gaspart's point when Barcelona beat Real Madrid against a background of passion whose temperature soared way beyond the norm for the average Champions League game. Not only was this a renewal of hostilities between Catalonia and the Spanish capitalists but Luis Figo, a Portuguese mercenary recently in the pay of Barca, had the temerity to turn up wearing the opposition's colours. Nick Barmby, who recently forsook Everton for Liverpool, is unlikely to be quite so fiercely reviled by his erstwhile fans at tomorrow's Merseyside derby. But the game will generate more heat than Thursday's tepid Uefa Cup encounter between Liverpool and Slovan Liberec, who for all the Kop knew, were a team of Czech pianists with a penchant for candelabra. The G15 lobby group, which includes Arsenal, United and Liverpool, as well as the leading clubs of Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Holland and Belgium, appear as hellbent as ever on getting a fully fledged European league up and running within the next five years. Running parallel to this is the idea of an Atlantic league involving teams from Scotland, Holland, Belgium and Portugal - Rangers, Celtic, Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, Anderlecht, Benfica, Sporting etc - who feel they need more competition than they are getting at home. So one way or the other it looks as if Uefa is fighting a rearguard action in keeping the Champions League the way it is, having already acceded to club pressure first in abandoning the two-leg knockout system which served the European Cup well enough for more than 35 years and then adding an extra round of group matches before the quarter-final stage.

Pakistan's twirly men scarcely need sympathetic surfaces. Saqlain Mushtaq is no ordinary off-spinner and Mushtaq Ahmed has rediscovered the fizzing leg-break to keep his googly company.

It's not the end of the world but we've got to learn quickly and the only way to do that is getting some time in the nets, practise and practise hard. </p> <p>\"I don't particularly blame the boys because they don't see an awful lot of spin apart from seeing Saqlain and Mushtaq at various times in the season.\" </p> <p>While Pakistan can take much credit from this victory, England should nevertheless shoulder some blame for defeat because even against high quality bowling they batted poorly and thought ineptly. </p> <p>Hussain, at three, slows the whole innings down. Given a decent start, worth 66 in 13 overs between Marcus Trescothick and Alec Stewart, there was a strong case for the promotion of Graeme Hick. And Andrew Flintoff should have come in before Graham Thorpe. When he did arrive he faced only 22 out of 55 balls delivered while he was there, scoring an anti-climatic 17. </p> <p>The thinking is intransigent. Captain and coach underline the importance of each player knowing his place and his role, but this is almost the antithesis of the good one-day player, who should be versatile in his skills and flexible in his mind. </p> <p>In Karachi they played brilliantly to defy their suspect tactics. Yesterday England scored a respectable 95 from their first 20 overs. But after 30 overs they had moved to only 125. There was an urgent need for greater impetus. But what we got was Hussain and Thorpe batting together. </p> <p>Thorpe, busily acquisitive, is the ideal foil for a heavy hitter. But he should not bat with Hussain, who should open or not play at all. These two batted between the 29th and 39th overs and added 49 when they needed something more than a run a ball. Hussain batted for 28 overs and 89 deliveries for his 54. When Wasim dropped him twice, a difficult chance at 45 and a dolly at 52, one wondered whether he had done so deliberately. </p> <p>England had been put in and their start mirrored their two weeks in Pakistan. Trescothick, who hit a six and five fours in his 74-ball 65, was all cool assurance while Stewart still fumbled for his touch. </p> <p>When Mushtaq came on to bowl the 13th over he had Stewart stumped first ball. Trescothick was second out at 116, caught at midwicket, the first of Afridi's five victims. </p> <p>Hick's dismissal, at 122, was a soft affair. He hesitated as he and Hussain ran a quick single and was so short of his ground he did not bother to run his bat in. He would have survived if he had because the throw missed and the batsman was only inches away from running over the line. </p> <p>There would be no recovery. Hussain, Thorpe and Flintoff quarried their singles from the tight attack until they perished and again, worryingly, there was no depth charge from Craig White or Mark Ealham. </p> <p>Pakistan's response became increasingly difficult to discern through the smog and dust and flies. At the end of the match, with the smoke from the riotous fireworks, visibility was about zero. </p> <p>Afridi, who had come into the side with Azhar Mahmood, at the expense of Imran Nazir and Waqar Younis, secured his man-of-the-match car with a dashing 61. Twice in an over he slogged Ashley Giles to cow corner for six. Ashley, oh Ashley, he was gone with the wind. </p> <p>The Warwickshire left-armer recovered to dismiss both openers and produce reasonable figures in view of his attacking fields. But Salim Elahi and Yousuf Youhana sauntered over the line with a stifled yawn.</p>",

Hick's dismissal, at 122, was a soft affair. He hesitated as he and Hussain ran a quick single and was so short of his ground he did not bother to run his bat in. He would have survived if he had because the throw missed and the batsman was only inches away from running over the line. There would be no recovery. Hussain, Thorpe and Flintoff quarried their singles from the tight attack until they perished and again, worryingly, there was no depth charge from Craig White or Mark Ealham. Pakistan's response became increasingly difficult to discern through the smog and dust and flies. At the end of the match, with the smoke from the riotous fireworks, visibility was about zero. Afridi, who had come into the side with Azhar Mahmood, at the expense of Imran Nazir and Waqar Younis, secured his man-of-the-match car with a dashing 61. Twice in an over he slogged Ashley Giles to cow corner for six. Ashley, oh Ashley, he was gone with the wind. The Warwickshire left-armer recovered to dismiss both openers and produce reasonable figures in view of his attacking fields. But Salim Elahi and Yousuf Youhana sauntered over the line with a stifled yawn.",

Yesterday he said: 'The question about conceivable risk was that it was my phrase. I have responsibility for that and I regret having made that statement. But the broader scientific advice coming to the government at that time was advice made in good faith by the relevant advisory body.\" As the contrite Mr Dorrell surfaced on Radio 4's Today programme, ministers signalled their determination to use Lord Phillips's report on the BSE crisis to create a far more open climate for 'mature debate\" on policy options and scientific advice in Whitehall . But their aims are doomed to disappoint freedom of information campaigners as not going far enough in giving electors the full picture. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, has asked for the names of officials involved in the policy-making.

His priority in the months ahead is to replace the old paternalism, which allowed officials to decide what should be put in the public domain, with a system which gives voters and the media the facts and lets them make their own assessments of the risk. Mr Brown is afraid that Lord Phillips's relatively gentle censure of ministers and officials who made bad judgments on BSE/ vCJD will allow 'a sigh of relief to go through Whitehall and prevent progress being as fast as it should be\". Had scientific advice flowing in to ministerial offices been available earlier, it is argued, many more people would have stopped eating beef to be on the safe side. However, the government was given a boost from an unlikely source yesterday. In one of the Anglo-French beef war's rare gestures of conciliation, the authoritative daily Le Monde heaped praise on the Phillips report, saying it represented a level of government transparency and accountability all but inconceivable in France.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair has two things weighing on his mind. First, how to win the next election. Second, what to do about the euro. The second is likely to prove more difficult than the first. While William Hague remains Tory leader a second term is assured, albeit with a smaller majority. </p> <p>But putting a foot wrong on the question of euro membership could easily cost the Prime Minister his job. </p> <p>It's not only in the financial markets that the euro is despised. Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the British public is deeply suspicious of ditching the pound for Europe's single currency. Yet the government has pledged that it is in favour, in principle, of joining EMU when the economic conditions are right and has promised to assess the situation early in the next parliament. Given the public mood, it's not hard to guess the outcome of that examination. </p> <p>The key issue for Britain is whether it stands to gain more than it loses. For the time being, at least, the answer is an economic no-brainer. We should stay out. </p> <p>The continental European economy was once a haven of stability and prosperity, controlled by the mighty Bundesbank. Britain was the home of boom/bust economics, where politicians set interest rates not to control inflation, but to win elections. Handing control of monetary policy to the Bundesbank, symbol of post-war German economic success, was seen as the ideal solution to the British disease. </p> <p>Now the situation is very different. Since being granted its independence by Gordon Brown in May 1997, the monetary policy committee (MCP) has steered the economy with great skill.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has two things weighing on his mind. First, how to win the next election. Second, what to do about the euro. The second is likely to prove more difficult than the first. While William Hague remains Tory leader a second term is assured, albeit with a smaller majority. But putting a foot wrong on the question of euro membership could easily cost the Prime Minister his job. It's not only in the financial markets that the euro is despised. Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the British public is deeply suspicious of ditching the pound for Europe's single currency. Yet the government has pledged that it is in favour, in principle, of joining EMU when the economic conditions are right and has promised to assess the situation early in the next parliament. Given the public mood, it's not hard to guess the outcome of that examination. The key issue for Britain is whether it stands to gain more than it loses. For the time being, at least, the answer is an economic no-brainer. We should stay out. The continental European economy was once a haven of stability and prosperity, controlled by the mighty Bundesbank. Britain was the home of boom/bust economics, where politicians set interest rates not to control inflation, but to win elections. Handing control of monetary policy to the Bundesbank, symbol of post-war German economic success, was seen as the ideal solution to the British disease. Now the situation is very different. Since being granted its independence by Gordon Brown in May 1997, the monetary policy committee (MCP) has steered the economy with great skill. It has largely got things right. EMU membership would involve a loss of fiscal sovereignty. Under the so-called stability pact, countries inside the eurozone have to keep their budget deficits and debt-to-GDP ratios within certain limits. Britain's public finances are so healthy that it easily qualifies for membership. But in harsher times, when the government needs to increase spending to offset the impact of an economic downturn, the loss of flexibility implied by the stability pact will be sorely missed.

      "body": "<p>The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and its high-octane music director, Sakari Oramo, are swirling to the end of a brief retrospective of 20th-century English music. \"Swirling\" is the operative word, for Oramo has chosen to close his final concerts with John Foulds's Three Mantras, a hair-raising piece of exotica, to put it mildly. </p> <p>Foulds, who died in 1939, was a Mancunian maverick, known in his day for incidental music and salon pieces. Towards the end of his not so long life, he was drawn to oriental philosophy and eventually went AWOL in India, having produced a series of colossal east-west fusion scores, most of which have never been published, some of which are presumed lost. Three Mantras, first performed in 1997, is all that is left of an opera called Avatara. Since it runs for half an hour and formed the prelude, one wonders just how long Foulds intended the opera to be. </p> <p>He owes his rediscovery, one suspects, to the New Age movement, though if anyone imagines Three Mantras is inherently pacific, they are in for a shock. This is, first and foremost, music of violent flux and ceaseless change, aspiring to portray endless cycles of destruction and reconstruction. </p> <p>It is the music, in short, of Shiva's eternal dance within the cosmic wheel. Raw, unruly string phrases lacerate the air, answered by savage trumpets. Pounding ostinati build relentlessly and Indian ragas are imploded into western passacaglias. Even when the pace subsides in the glittering, beatific central section, Foulds keeps the uneasy tension going by means of protracted chromatic dissonances. </p> <p>He has been seen by some as a musical law unto himself, a kind of English Ives - though that isn't strictly true. In idiom, he's a post-Wagnerian tonal extremist. There are echoes of Holst and resonances of Mahler - both of whom were also influenced by eastern philosophy. For Oramo - the wild boy of the podium - Three Mantras is a gift.

      "bodyText": "The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and its high-octane music director, Sakari Oramo, are swirling to the end of a brief retrospective of 20th-century English music. \"Swirling\" is the operative word, for Oramo has chosen to close his final concerts with John Foulds's Three Mantras, a hair-raising piece of exotica, to put it mildly. Foulds, who died in 1939, was a Mancunian maverick, known in his day for incidental music and salon pieces. Towards the end of his not so long life, he was drawn to oriental philosophy and eventually went AWOL in India, having produced a series of colossal east-west fusion scores, most of which have never been published, some of which are presumed lost. Three Mantras, first performed in 1997, is all that is left of an opera called Avatara. Since it runs for half an hour and formed the prelude, one wonders just how long Foulds intended the opera to be. He owes his rediscovery, one suspects, to the New Age movement, though if anyone imagines Three Mantras is inherently pacific, they are in for a shock. This is, first and foremost, music of violent flux and ceaseless change, aspiring to portray endless cycles of destruction and reconstruction. It is the music, in short, of Shiva's eternal dance within the cosmic wheel. Raw, unruly string phrases lacerate the air, answered by savage trumpets. Pounding ostinati build relentlessly and Indian ragas are imploded into western passacaglias. Even when the pace subsides in the glittering, beatific central section, Foulds keeps the uneasy tension going by means of protracted chromatic dissonances. He has been seen by some as a musical law unto himself, a kind of English Ives - though that isn't strictly true. In idiom, he's a post-Wagnerian tonal extremist. There are echoes of Holst and resonances of Mahler - both of whom were also influenced by eastern philosophy. For Oramo - the wild boy of the podium - Three Mantras is a gift. The CBSO play it with sinewy, extravagant vehemence. Elsewhere, Oramo's choice of repertory is more conventional, - though his approach is radical. There is no attempt at nostalgia or parochial insularity. Oramo hurls English music kicking and screaming into the European mainstream. He turns Elgar's Cockaigne into a tone poem of spine-tingling Straussian zap, in which, for once, there is not a shred of imperial pomp. Vaughan Williams's Toward the Unknown Region is similarly shown as owing a debt to Brahms before the composer's own voice finally makes its distinct appearance. Britten's Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings asserts a universality of emotion and experience, and Oramo is sensitive to its every flicker of mood.

The \"Big Four\" banks, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, NatWest and HSBC, have a staggering 30m current accounts between them, yet are paying most of these people a rate of interest of just 0.1% and are charging them authorised overdraft rates of around 17%-18%. </p> <p>In the past few months we have started to see the first serious attempts by rivals to end this domination of the market, with a number of the new internet banks launching current accounts paying savings-style rates of interest. </p> <p>And former building society the Halifax this month really ratcheted up the pressure with the launch of what it claims is \"the most competitive current account on the high street\", paying 4% interest and with an authorised overdraft rate of only 10%. </p> <p>The new account will be available from January and you'll have to have at least \u00a31,000 going into the account every month to obtain these rates. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see if the Halifax's clout can overcome the legendary apathy that exists among the UK public when it comes to changing banks. It's always been said that you're more likely to change your spouse than your bank account. </p> <p>Most people regard switching their bank as a time- consuming process and fraught with danger - specifically, people worry that someone will bungle the moving over of their direct debits and other payments. In August, Jobs &amp; Money told how Jonathan Morrell found himself embroiled in a tortuous saga when he switched his account from Halifax to Smile. </p> <p>Earlier this month we appealed for people to tell us their account-switching experiences. Here, David Bull and Leslie Connor relate how it was for them. While Mr Connor says he believes the difficulties are often overstated, Mr Bull says his changeover was far from hassle-free. </p> <p>The banks and building societies have been told that they must make it easier for people to move their accounts, and to this end more than a dozen institutions are taking part in what is called the \"current account transfer scheme\" which started last autumn. </p> <p>This supposedly enables payments to be moved seamlessly from a customer's old account to the new one, with the new bank undertaking most or all of the work. </p> <p>The new bank contacts the old bank, receives the list of payments, then contacts the companies who take money from your account and instructs them to amend the existing direct debit instructions to include the new bank details. </p> <p>The new bank is also able to set up the new standing order instructions and then confirm to the customer that the payment instructions have been transferred. </p> <p>The banks and building societies taking part in the pilot scheme are: Barclays, Abbey National, Co-operative Bank (including Smile), Halifax (including Intelligent Finance), Virgin One, Woolwich, Nationwide, Royal Bank of Scotland, the National Australia Bank Group (includes Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Northern Bank), Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank. </p> <p>So what are some of the best current account rates available now? </p> <p>As you might expect, the best rates are on the net - the Halifax's Intelligent Finance (<a href=\"http://www.if.com\">www.if.com</a>) is paying 5% while Cahoot (<a href=\"http://www.cahoot.com\">www.cahoot.com</a> - part of the Abbey National group) is offering between 5% and 7.1%, though to get the latter rate you have to have \u00a35,000-plus in your account and have to go without a cheque book. </p> <p>The Co-op Bank's Smile (<a href=\"http://www.smile.co.uk\">www.smile.co.uk</a>) is paying 4.75%, while First-e (<a href=\"http://www.first-e.com\">www.first-e.com</a> - a subsidiary of French bank Banque d'Escompte) is offering 4.88%. </p> <p>Getting away from the internet, there are only pretty thin pickings to be found - Nationwide's FlexAccount pays from 1.45%, while the Woolwich's Open Plan account pays 2%.</p> <p><strong>I switched and it was fine... </strong></p> <p>Father-of-three Leslie Connor moved his current account from Barclays to Nationwide as part of a thorough makeover of his finances that saw him switching utility companies and signing up with a cheaper home and contents insurance provider. </p> <p>He had been with Barclays for more than 10 years but decided to move to Nationwide because of its no-fee overdraft facility (Barclays imposes a \u00a35 a month usage fee for authorised overdrafts).</p> <p>\"My account is relatively simple - just 12 direct debits and a debit card,\" he says. \"So I contacted all the direct debit companies by post about a month before switching and asked for new mandate forms.

      "bodyText": "Every which way they turn the traditional high street banks are seeing rivals such as the new wave of internet banks and retailers attempting to muscle in on their territory. Marks &amp; Spencer is just one of many players giving them a run for their money - earlier this month it revealed it is opening bank branch-style financial centres in 30 of its stores over the next 18 months where people will be able to talk to specially trained staff about products such as personal loans and cash Isas. However, the real battleground in the coming months will be centred around current accounts. The \"Big Four\" banks, Barclays, Lloyds TSB, NatWest and HSBC, have a staggering 30m current accounts between them, yet are paying most of these people a rate of interest of just 0.1% and are charging them authorised overdraft rates of around 17%-18%. In the past few months we have started to see the first serious attempts by rivals to end this domination of the market, with a number of the new internet banks launching current accounts paying savings-style rates of interest. And former building society the Halifax this month really ratcheted up the pressure with the launch of what it claims is \"the most competitive current account on the high street\", paying 4% interest and with an authorised overdraft rate of only 10%. The new account will be available from January and you'll have to have at least \u00a31,000 going into the account every month to obtain these rates. It will be interesting to see if the Halifax's clout can overcome the legendary apathy that exists among the UK public when it comes to changing banks. It's always been said that you're more likely to change your spouse than your bank account. Most people regard switching their bank as a time- consuming process and fraught with danger - specifically, people worry that someone will bungle the moving over of their direct debits and other payments. In August, Jobs &amp; Money told how Jonathan Morrell found himself embroiled in a tortuous saga when he switched his account from Halifax to Smile. Earlier this month we appealed for people to tell us their account-switching experiences. Here, David Bull and Leslie Connor relate how it was for them. While Mr Connor says he believes the difficulties are often overstated, Mr Bull says his changeover was far from hassle-free. The banks and building societies have been told that they must make it easier for people to move their accounts, and to this end more than a dozen institutions are taking part in what is called the \"current account transfer scheme\" which started last autumn. This supposedly enables payments to be moved seamlessly from a customer's old account to the new one, with the new bank undertaking most or all of the work. The new bank contacts the old bank, receives the list of payments, then contacts the companies who take money from your account and instructs them to amend the existing direct debit instructions to include the new bank details. The new bank is also able to set up the new standing order instructions and then confirm to the customer that the payment instructions have been transferred. The banks and building societies taking part in the pilot scheme are: Barclays, Abbey National, Co-operative Bank (including Smile), Halifax (including Intelligent Finance), Virgin One, Woolwich, Nationwide, Royal Bank of Scotland, the National Australia Bank Group (includes Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Northern Bank), Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank. So what are some of the best current account rates available now? As you might expect, the best rates are on the net - the Halifax's Intelligent Finance (www.if.com) is paying 5% while Cahoot (www.cahoot.com - part of the Abbey National group) is offering between 5% and 7.1%, though to get the latter rate you have to have \u00a35,000-plus in your account and have to go without a cheque book. The Co-op Bank's Smile (www.smile.co.uk) is paying 4.75%, while First-e (www.first-e.com - a subsidiary of French bank Banque d'Escompte) is offering 4.88%. Getting away from the internet, there are only pretty thin pickings to be found - Nationwide's FlexAccount pays from 1.45%, while the Woolwich's Open Plan account pays 2%. I switched and it was fine... Father-of-three Leslie Connor moved his current account from Barclays to Nationwide as part of a thorough makeover of his finances that saw him switching utility companies and signing up with a cheaper home and contents insurance provider. He had been with Barclays for more than 10 years but decided to move to Nationwide because of its no-fee overdraft facility (Barclays imposes a \u00a35 a month usage fee for authorised overdrafts). \"My account is relatively simple - just 12 direct debits and a debit card,\" he says. \"So I contacted all the direct debit companies by post about a month before switching and asked for new mandate forms. The companies took up to two weeks to reply.

He is happy with Smile's offering but says of the switch: \"It was a bit of a hassle.\" As with other customers, it was moving the direct debits that caused the problems, says Mr Bull, 49, who lives near Oxford and is executive director of the UK branch of Unicef. Smile promises to write to all the firms that take money from your account by direct debit to give them the new account details and set a date for the switch to take place. \"In theory, you can leave it all to the new bank and need take no further action yourself. In practice, however, I received a succession of letters from my direct debit payees saying they had tried to draw from the old bank and been refused, and asking me to fill in a new form.

      "bodyText": "Henry McLeish was formally voted in as Scotland's first minister yesterday as he pledged that he would not bow to influence from London. At the weekend he had been made interim leader of the Scottish Labour party using a controversially scaled-down version of the party's normal electoral procedure. Accepting his new position, an emotional Mr McLeish said: \"It is a very great privilege. Thanks for the honour - and let me say I won't let you down.\" The Queen will formally approve the first minister today, before he is sworn in at the court of session in Edinburgh. Both the Scots Conservative leader, David McLetchie, and the Scottish National party leader, John Swinney, stood against Mr McLeish in yesterday's vote by MSPs, ostensibly in protest at his apparent choice by London and at a subsequent peace offer to liaise with his party by means of his civil servant advisers. Of 123 MSPs voting yesterday, Mr McLeish received 68 votes, Mr Swinney 33, Mr McLetchie 19, and Dennis Canavan, an independent, three.",

      "body": "<p>We had more or less forgotten the Kursk, the Russian nuclear submarine that sank with all hands in August. For a week then it had dominated the headlines, the world held spellbound by the idea that men were dying before our very eyes, tapping out desperate messages that could not be answered. The botched rescue attempts ended, the crew were declared dead, interest waned.</p> <p>What really drove the story off the front pages was the assurance from President Putin that the 118 submariners had died almost instantaneously, drowning as the vessel foundered in the icy waters of the Barents sea. It was a tragedy, but a recognisable one: ships sink, men die. Death is ordinary; it is the process of dying that is not.</p> <p>But Putin's assurances were misplaced. The discovery yesterday of a note in the pocket of an officer aboard the Kursk suggests that some of the crew did survive for several hours after the vessel sank, perhaps longer. \"It is 13.15. All personnel from sections six, seven and eight have moved to section nine,\" wrote Lieutenant-Captain Dmitri Kolesnikov. \"There are 23 of us here. We have made this decision because none of us can escape.\"</p> <p>The words are matter of fact, almost banal: no heroics, no hysteria. On one side of the single sheet of paper, he gives a factual account of the sinking; on the other side, increasingly illegibly as the light fades, he bids farewell to his wife, Olga. \"I'm writing blind,\" says Kolesnikov. There are some figures, but it is unclear what they mean. We are reading blind. But we are reading, and the words are riveting because our darkest imaginings back in August were correct: some men survived and were confronted with the imminence and inevitability of their own deaths. Brutus, preferring honour, may have been able to look at death with indifference, but we cannot, not when the veil is lifted as it is here. Now we will remember the Kursk forever.</p> <p>Death in the past has usually been mediated. We could rarely be witnesses to the last moments of the living. Most last words sound as if someone else minted them later to confirm that a person died as he lived. From George V's \"Bugger Bognor\" and PT Barnum's \"How were the receipts today in Madison Square Garden?\" to Thomas \u00e0 Becket's \"I am ready to die for my Lord\", we are being assured that the famous died without anxiety, and most of all that they died in character. Dying is made to seem like the logical conclusion to living: a drawing down of the curtain on a play we have understood.</p> <p>Gladiators, we were told, would salute Caesar before embracing death; churchmen like Becket would willingly go to their rest; fictional heroes such as Sidney Carton would happily sacrifice themselves. Death was not something to be feared. The elaborate statuary of Victorian cemeteries is a celebration of death. By contrast, our dull headstones - their size and shape dictated by stringent regulations to allow for lawnmowers - reflect a desire to forget it. We fear death, but have to confront it as never before. This is the first age in which death is not mediated. The dying can make us feel the reality of their final moments, and we can hear the emptiness of the ocean.</p> <p>We have had messages from the dying before, but they have usually been heroic narratives which reinforced the notion of a worthy death. One of the most striking is the diary of Captain Scott, who kept a detailed record of his ill-fated mission to the South Pole in 1912.\"There was a blizzard blowing in the morning when Oates said 'I am just going outside and may be some time' and he stumbled out of the tent. We knew that poor Oates was walking to his death, but though we tried to dissuade him, we knew it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman.\"</p> <p>The idea of a gentleman's death animates both the diary and the letters Scott wrote as he lay dying. To his wife Kathleen, he wrote: \"I want you to take the whole thing very sensibly, as I am sure you will. You know I cherish no sentimental rubbish about remarriage. When the right man comes to help you in life you ought to be your happy self again. I wasn't a very good husband, but I hope I shall be a good memory.\"</p> <p>Scott's carefully wrought final thoughts are very different from Lieutenant-Captain Kolesnikov's scribbled message. Scott offers us consolation; Kolesnikov none. Scott had reached the conclusion of a struggle in which he had ultimately been defeated; he has much he wishes to say (including instructions on how his son was to be educated). Kolesnikov is passing the time awaiting death, struggling to see in near darkness.</p> <p>Increasingly we are allowed to witness that final wait: to experience not Scott-like heroism but the banality, pathos or sheer terror of the moment. Technological change has given us unprecedented access to the process of dying. Kolesnikov's final thoughts were, like Scott's, recorded on paper, but we can only read them thanks to modern salvage equipment. Black boxes record the final words of pilots as their planes plunge into the abyss. Mobile phones and satellite technology mean there is now no place on earth where people are out of reach. Internet links and webcams make it possible to share your life with a worldwide audience. Or, if you wish, your death. The dying, by accident or by design, are now public property.</p> <p>In 1996, Timothy Leary orchestrated his dying in a manner wholly appropriate to the modern age which, in the 60s, he had helped to define. Diagnosed as having terminal cancer, he allowed web users to share his final days via his home page. \"Why not? Why not? Why not?\" were his final words to the thousands attending the internet vigil.</p> <p>Leary also committed his final testament to film, in The Enthusiastic Death of Timothy Leary. Again he was being prescient: though we frequently sanitise death and talk about it euphemistically, we are increasingly willing to film it.

In an age of TV surveillance and mobile communication, few deaths can be private. The photograph of the terrifying final moments of 12-year-old Mohammed al-Durrah, the Palestinian boy shot in Gaza earlier this month, became the defining image of the renewed Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

      "bodyText": "We had more or less forgotten the Kursk, the Russian nuclear submarine that sank with all hands in August. For a week then it had dominated the headlines, the world held spellbound by the idea that men were dying before our very eyes, tapping out desperate messages that could not be answered. The botched rescue attempts ended, the crew were declared dead, interest waned. What really drove the story off the front pages was the assurance from President Putin that the 118 submariners had died almost instantaneously, drowning as the vessel foundered in the icy waters of the Barents sea. It was a tragedy, but a recognisable one: ships sink, men die. Death is ordinary; it is the process of dying that is not. But Putin's assurances were misplaced. The discovery yesterday of a note in the pocket of an officer aboard the Kursk suggests that some of the crew did survive for several hours after the vessel sank, perhaps longer. \"It is 13.15. All personnel from sections six, seven and eight have moved to section nine,\" wrote Lieutenant-Captain Dmitri Kolesnikov. \"There are 23 of us here. We have made this decision because none of us can escape.\" The words are matter of fact, almost banal: no heroics, no hysteria. On one side of the single sheet of paper, he gives a factual account of the sinking; on the other side, increasingly illegibly as the light fades, he bids farewell to his wife, Olga. \"I'm writing blind,\" says Kolesnikov. There are some figures, but it is unclear what they mean. We are reading blind. But we are reading, and the words are riveting because our darkest imaginings back in August were correct: some men survived and were confronted with the imminence and inevitability of their own deaths. Brutus, preferring honour, may have been able to look at death with indifference, but we cannot, not when the veil is lifted as it is here. Now we will remember the Kursk forever. Death in the past has usually been mediated. We could rarely be witnesses to the last moments of the living. Most last words sound as if someone else minted them later to confirm that a person died as he lived. From George V's \"Bugger Bognor\" and PT Barnum's \"How were the receipts today in Madison Square Garden?\" to Thomas \u00e0 Becket's \"I am ready to die for my Lord\", we are being assured that the famous died without anxiety, and most of all that they died in character. Dying is made to seem like the logical conclusion to living: a drawing down of the curtain on a play we have understood. Gladiators, we were told, would salute Caesar before embracing death; churchmen like Becket would willingly go to their rest; fictional heroes such as Sidney Carton would happily sacrifice themselves. Death was not something to be feared. The elaborate statuary of Victorian cemeteries is a celebration of death. By contrast, our dull headstones - their size and shape dictated by stringent regulations to allow for lawnmowers - reflect a desire to forget it. We fear death, but have to confront it as never before. This is the first age in which death is not mediated. The dying can make us feel the reality of their final moments, and we can hear the emptiness of the ocean. We have had messages from the dying before, but they have usually been heroic narratives which reinforced the notion of a worthy death. One of the most striking is the diary of Captain Scott, who kept a detailed record of his ill-fated mission to the South Pole in 1912.\"There was a blizzard blowing in the morning when Oates said 'I am just going outside and may be some time' and he stumbled out of the tent.

But almost a third of the authorities did not record current GCSE attainment by ethnic origin. Of just six authorities who included baseline assessments by ethnic group, one large inner-city authority showed that African-Caribbean pupils enter compulsory schooling as the highest achieving group but leave as the group least likely to gain five high grade GCSEs. Data from this authority shows that the relative attainment of African-Caribbean pupils declines at each key stage at school. The researchers said: \"That any ethnic group could enter school 20 percentage points in advance of the average but leave 21 points behind opens up an important area for educational debate on ethnic minority attainment.\" Co-author David Gillborn added: \"This is a shocking report which underlines the need for some form of national monitoring by the DfEE. Black pupils often enter schools ahead of their white peers. \"It is scandalous that they fall behind and end up in restricted ability groups, being entered for the lower tiers of GCSEs.\" The school standards minister, Jacqui Smith, said: \"It is good that ethnic minority children are achieving higher standards, but there is varied performance between authorities. \"Clearly more needs to be done, which is why we have shown our commitment to helping schools and authorities further in this important work.\"",

But, mainly thanks to Taylor it has to be said, the group has come to no agreement. The head of the PFA, who doubles as boss of the Europe-wide player's union Fifpro, decided not to attend this morning's TTF plenary meeting because he has spent the past few months arguing with them. So instead he sent a sheet of proposed amendments and hoped they would be discussed.</p> <p>They weren't, and Gordon got a bit testy. \"[The TTF's] proposals are too ambiguous, although they are designed that way because essentially all the leagues and associations want to do is try to maintain things as they are,\" Gordon told the world in his best conspiratorial tones. \"For the meeting not to even discuss our alternatives is very disappointing to say the least. It appears they have a hidden agenda.\" </p> <p>Gordon then stormed off and walked in on a press conference being held by Sepp Blatter who - surprise surprise - is head of the TTF.

The documents will go out on Tuesday, so we want to make sure that staff heard about it all from us before they read about it in the paper. Also wanted to give press briefings to try to ensure some well informed coverage. (I am resolutely optimistic - even in the face of bitter experience.)</p> <p>Staff briefings go well. Chief executive chairs, executive member for children and health presents, I speak about what we are doing and how we are moving forward, there are questions and the leader of the council winds up. The chair of scrutiny is also on the panel. I think it works, in terms of staff seeing the high level of corporate commitment and concern there is in the organisation. Turnout is a bit low, not least because it's half term. </p> <p>It is a challenge to keep staff's hearts up while enabling proper, thoughtful reflection on the past and the undoubted failings of the organisation.

      "bodyText": "Should have been off this week for half term - but had to come in on Monday to spend the day briefing staff and the press about the impending Barratt report. The report will be discussed on October 30 at a special policy committee, alongside the social services inspectorate report about our children's services. The documents will go out on Tuesday, so we want to make sure that staff heard about it all from us before they read about it in the paper. Also wanted to give press briefings to try to ensure some well informed coverage. (I am resolutely optimistic - even in the face of bitter experience.) Staff briefings go well. Chief executive chairs, executive member for children and health presents, I speak about what we are doing and how we are moving forward, there are questions and the leader of the council winds up. The chair of scrutiny is also on the panel. I think it works, in terms of staff seeing the high level of corporate commitment and concern there is in the organisation. Turnout is a bit low, not least because it's half term. It is a challenge to keep staff's hearts up while enabling proper, thoughtful reflection on the past and the undoubted failings of the organisation. It is a difficult time and will continue to be until Christmas. These reports will be followed by the joint review and it is hard to deal with a sequence of reports telling you things are bad. I hope we can keep the many good staff and managers we have and continue to attract more over the coming months. Finish off the day with policy committee where there is long discussion about our family finders services and how the best value review is being implemented. I collapse in bed later and forget until the morning that I am on holiday. \u0095 Lisa Christensen is executive director, social services and health improvement, for the London borough of Lambeth",

      "bodyText": "Legislation to make life tougher for Chinese men with concubines has been tabled this week for debate in parliament in Beijing. The marriage law was last changed in 1980; now sweeping amendments are being considered by the standing committee of the National People's Congress. The initiative responds to a tide of public opinion against misbehaving husbands, led by the official Women's Federation - a tide swollen by anger at corrupt officials who use their ill-gotten loot to finance a \"second wife\". Hong Kong businessmen with mistresses on the mainland are also feeling the pressure: a typical case is that of Lin Guande, who has been sentenced to six months in a Chinese jail. Lin, like many other Hong Kongers trading in Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong, found a new Chinese partner, and relations with his wife deteriorated at home. He and his mistress, Lao Xia, made the mistake of holding a \"wedding party\" to celebrate their relationship at an expensive restaurant late last year. He has been sentenced to six months for bigamy; his partner has been given a suspended sentence. The proposed amendments to the marriage law reflect widespread concern at a decline in the institution of marriage. The Women's Federation in Guangzhou city, the capital of Guangdong province, has even been pressing for extra-marital affairs to be made illegal. Pressure for the changes, says the China Daily, has been \"largely caused by the 'concubine phenomenon' that is sweeping the country, especially in southern provinces, as increasing numbers of men get wealthier\". In the most notorious recent case a senior official sentenced to death for corruption in July, Cheng Kejie, was said to have committed his crimes in collusion with his mistress, Li Ping. Pictures of the gold, diamond rings and expensive watches the two accumulated were shown in public anti-corruption exhibitions. A Communist party spokesman said the \"temptations of women and money\" were to blame for Mr Cheng's fall from his position as top party boss in Guangxi province. Guilty officials The pending revision of the law covers not only bigamy - already a criminal offence - but also domestic violence, property rights and the care of children. Divorce was almost unheard of during the decades of Mao Zedong's leadership, from the 1950s to the 1970s, when social pressure ensured that couples stayed together even when their marriage had broken down. Though the current statistics are unreliable, one newspaper claimed this week that as many as a million marriages now break down each year. Another estimate held domestic violence responsible for one in three cases. Keeping concubines is associated in Chinese minds with the feudal society of the past, when rich men might have half a dozen secondary wives in one household. The practice was eroded by modern 20th-century thinking, and outlawed by the post-1949 socialist society. Today's \"number two women\" are installed in separate accommodation, often in a different town from the primary family home. Chinese experts say that a large number of the men involved are Communist party officials who embezzle public funds to set up a second home. Several recent cases of corruption in high places have featured a mistress, whose role has been painted in lurid colours by the popular press. A senior official of the the standing committee considering the amendments, Hu Kangsheng, said the rise in adultery had as its driving force \"rich and powerful [people] who became subjected to the obsolete and decadent ways of thinking of the feudalist society of the past\". To many younger Chinese the issue is more complex than that. They take a more relaxed view of sexual behaviour, and they may have watched their own parents endure loveless marriages. Various new definitions of bigamy have been suggested, including cohabitation for more than six months and a partnership which produces children. The draft law does not contain such rigid stipulations: Mr Hu said this week that the committee would have to consult legal experts and the supreme court first.

Agn\u00e8s b epitomises French chic and understatement, while Everlast is a rugged sports brand little known outside the often brutal world of boxing. But in fact the synergy is as crystal clear as the gulf between Ali and most of his opponents. Agn\u00e8s b eschews ostentation in her work, dislikes the fashion world (she always refers to her designs as clothing, never fashion) and has stuck to many of her classic styles since founding the label in 1973.

Everlast, meanwhile, continues to produce garments almost identical to those of 50 years ago and studiously avoids designs that flirt with fashionability. </p> <p>Agn\u00e8s b has always admired Everlast's classicism and heritage, but was unaware of the mutual respect at Everlast for her designs. \"About three years ago, Everlast sent a selection of their classic garments as a present,\" she explains, \"saying they thought the two labels were connected by their simplicity and everlasting designs.

Fleeing from her middle-class background as a youth, Agn\u00e8s opted for right-on poverty, marches and ferrying wounded demonstrators to hospital in her car.

Everlast, too, provokes fierce loyalty in the boxing world. The company has been based in New York's Bronx since 1910, handing out free sportswear to promising boxers. </p> <p>\"Famous boxers including Ali, Larry Holmes and Evander Holyfield wore Everlast at the height of their careers but no fee was paid.

It is impossible to imagine top sportsmen wearing Nike or Adidas for free today. </p> <p>A combination of loyalty and moral rectitude has also meant that, until now, Agn\u00e8s has refused to manufacture anything outside her native France, partly out of patriotism, partly because quality is high in French factories, but mainly because she wants to avoid exploitation of workers in developing countries, which other labels routinely accept. With b Everlast, though, and its sister range b Sport, the policy is changing slightly. \"The collection is made in Morocco because we have increasing ties with North Africa in France and because I like it there,\" she says. \"The factory is also socially responsible as decent wages are paid and child labour is not used.\" </p> <p> This sort of attention to detail is evident throughout the Agn\u00e8s b empire, which employs more than 1,200 people worldwide. In addition to 114 boutiques, she has since 1984 run an art gallery in Paris which has showcased cutting-edge artists such as Seydou Keita, Frederic Bruly Bouabre and photographer Martin Parr. Since 1997 she has funded a magazine, published eight times every year, which gives free rein to selected artists to do as they wish; 100,000 copies are distributed free around the world and recent collaborators have included Gilbert and George, writer-director Harmony Korine and Louise Bourgeois. In 1998, Agn\u00e8s was the first French person to present the Turner prize to the winner. </p> <p>Then there are the movies.

Now, though, we're more likely to be coveting our competitors' Scotch House cashmere or Burberry pullover.And it's no longer discreet chic that impresses - where else but on the 18th hole would you get away with a pink gingham visor?",

      "body": "<p>Erin Pizzey (Letters, October 26) challenges Bea Campbell's observations that \"men are the problem\" (Comment, October 25) for our understanding of violence. I am the author of the snapshot of domestic violence in the UK (the results can be found on: <a href=\"http://www.domesticviolencedata.org\">www.domesticviolencedata.org</a>). This study was based on police activity throughout the UK on September 28. </p> <p>On this day, 81% of those contacting police were women attacked by men, 8% men attacked by women; 4% women attacked by women and 7% men attacked by men. Even \"official\" statistics show that men as perpetrators overwhelmingly dominate domestic violence. Men even attack other men almost as often as women attack them. For some men, domestic violence surely lurks at home.

      "bodyText": "Erin Pizzey (Letters, October 26) challenges Bea Campbell's observations that \"men are the problem\" (Comment, October 25) for our understanding of violence. I am the author of the snapshot of domestic violence in the UK (the results can be found on: www.domesticviolencedata.org). This study was based on police activity throughout the UK on September 28. On this day, 81% of those contacting police were women attacked by men, 8% men attacked by women; 4% women attacked by women and 7% men attacked by men. Even \"official\" statistics show that men as perpetrators overwhelmingly dominate domestic violence. Men even attack other men almost as often as women attack them. For some men, domestic violence surely lurks at home. But to deny the impact of gender in the information we have about domestic violence is surely a mistake. I suggest that Pizzey begin a campaign to stop pub violence. Here is indeed a very serious issue of men's safety vis-a-vis violence in this country.

She told him: \"Fine, if the music is good, let them play.\" Shohat needed to hear that; his Polish-born grandmother had lost several close relatives in the Nazi holocaust.</p> <p>\"That was my seal of approval,\" he says.</p> <p>It is a blessing that Shohat and the rest of the Israel Symphony Orchestra (ISO) could use tonight when they defy a powerful taboo to perform a short piece by Wagner, who remains for Israelis a symbol of anti-semitism. For an older generation, the composer's music is inextricably linked with Hitler - although the German maestro died 50 years before the Nazis came to power. Hitler adored him and claimed inspiration from a racist essay Wagner wrote that earned him the reputation of the arch anti-semite of the musical world.</p> <p>On Wednesday, a judge in Tel Aviv threw out a petition from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, and other holocaust activists, for a restraining order against the ISO, which is based in the central Israeli town of Rishon LeZion. But that did not end the controversy.</p> <p>The activists appealed to Israel's supreme court, but yesterday it refused to ban the performance. There are plans to demonstrate outside the concert hall, and to use Wagner to draw attention to some 200 anti-semitic attacks around the world, the fallout from Israeli army's bloody clashes with Palestinian demonstrators.</p> <p>\"On a symbolic level, it would be incredibly ironic to have Wagner played for the first time in Israel while anti-semitic outbreaks are taking place all over the world,\" says Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre.</p> <p>When the ISO, the smaller, innovative rival to the more famous Israel Philharmonic, announced earlier this year it was putting Wagner's Siegfried Idyll on the programme for its chamber music series, Shohat and other members of the ensemble braced themselves for the storm that was expected to follow. \"Of course, I was worried,\" he says. \"I did not want to hurt anyone. I know that Wagner is a symbol for Holocaust survivors.\"</p> <p>There was an initial frisson of anger, and then silence. A single ISO supporter cancelled his subscription and a few musicians refused to take part, but unlike other attempts to stage Wagner in Israel, this time it appeared the show was going to go on.</p> <p>Even so, the orchestra proceeded with extreme caution. It chose a relatively short piece, and one that is shorn of political content: Siegfried's Idyll was written for the birth of Wagner's son. It also decided to reduce the potential for confrontation by relegating Wagner to its second series, played on Friday at lunchtime, and by limiting its advertising.</p> <p>The extreme delicacy is testimony to the tremendous power Wagner exercises on the popular imagination. Israel is home to 300,000 survivors of the Nazi Holocaust, and the experience is central to the identity of younger generations.</p> <p>For one day each year, the country freezes to a halt for the siren, whose wail announces two minutes of official remembrance of the Nazis' victims. Radio and television stations are turned over to the broadcast of documentaries about extermination camps and Nazi atrocities.</p> <p>And the Holocaust is the backdrop for the epic struggle between those who want Israel to remain a fundamentally Jewish state, and those who map out a \"post-Zionist\" future where Jews and Arabs live as equals.</p> <p>But at the same time as the Holocaust has remained a defining part of Israeli identity, the 52 years since the creation of a Jewish state have seen a shucking off of the fears that form an older, European view of the world.</p> <p>\"From the 50s, Israelis, including survivors of the concentration camps, drove Volkswagens which were the spiritual creature of Hitler, and they received compensation from the German government,\" says Ehud Grosz, director of the ISO. \"We had the Pope visit earlier this year, and he expressed some kind of remorse for anti-semitism, and we had the president of Germany address our Israeli parliament in Germany. The memory of the Holocaust doesn't need a ban on Wagner.\"</p> <p>That appears to be the prevailing view for musicians and the Israeli cultural elite: the time has come to put Wagner on the programme. In such rarefied circles, it is an accepted fact that no orchestra can aspire to world-class status if it does not play Wagner. The Israel Philharmonic practises his works in secret.</p> <p>\"The debate is: do we or do we not distinguish between the artist and his art?\" Grosz says. \"I think we do, but with sensitivity, and so we have waited for more than 50 years.\"</p> <p>In the early days of the Jewish state, it was impossible to distinguish between the man and the music. Until the 60s, Israel's state-owned radio refused to broadcast Schubert's lieder - unless they were sung in Hebrew. It was only a decade ago that Israeli orchestras began performing Bach's St John's Passion, which is now popular with audiences, who apparently fail to notice the depiction of the Jews rigorously calling for the crucifixion of Jesus. Nowadays, Richard Strauss, who was a member of the Nazi party, is regularly featured on concert programmes, and Wagner's recordings are freely available in music shops.</p> <p>But is Israel ready for Wagner?</p> <p>In 1981, when conductor Zubin Mehta tried to slip a Wagner composition into an encore at the Philharmonic, the audience began chanting, \"Shame, shame\" and an usher leapt on to the stage and rolled up his sleeve to display the blue tattooed number of his concentration camp.</p> <p>Zuroff would argue the country is not ready even now. \"There is a certain arrogance to the stance of the Rishon LeZion orchestra trying to present this as a debate between enlightened people, and irrational people,\" he says. \"It is reprehensible to use supposed cultural values to inflict pain on many Israelis.\"</p> <p>But since the late 80s, under the stewardship of music director Avi Hanani, Israel Radio has been gently removing the cultural barriers against composers linked to the Nazi era. In the past decade, they have introduced Israelis to the works of Richard Strauss as well as artists who prospered under the Nazi regime, including Herbert von Karajan and Elizabeth Schwartzkopf. Five years ago, there was a Wagner broadcast, albeit as part of a documentary.</p> <p>The ISO conducted the first performance of Strauss, and last summer the New Israel Opera staged the first performance of a Strauss opera, Elektra, at the Romanian ampitheatre in Cesarea and received a 15-minute standing ovation.</p> <p>Hanani's efforts at enlightenment have not gone unopposed. Last month, Israel Radio's board of directors pulled a broadcast of Wagner's Lohengrin, the day before it was to be aired. \"They told us: 'You can not allow music to be played on the radio that was broadcast on the way to the crematoria',\" Hanani says. Except that, in truth, Wagner wasn't. That infamy goes to works routinely played in Israel such as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, and Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.</p> <p>\"None of us heard Wagner in the time of the Holocaust.

If this were true it would only be a matter of time before fading memories of Nazism and the passing of Holocaust survivors allowed his rehabilitation. Indeed, many Wagner apologists point to the admiration which Jews had for Wagner before his work was tainted by Hitler.</p> <p>Jews were amongst the earliest champions of Wagner. He relied on Hermann Levi to conduct his operas; the pianist Karl Taussig raised money for the Festspielhaus at Bayreuth; Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, was a fanatical devotee who regularly attended performances of Wagner's operas in Paris in 1895, and composed the manifesto for Israel, The Jewish State, in a frenzy inspired by Tannhauser. But this hardly makes pre-Holocaust Wagner any more kosher.</p> <p>In his youth Wagner believed that Germans had to free themselves from alien influences from abroad and within. He abhorred the commercial ethos and materialism he believed were corrupting the German people. It was common in the 1840s to identify Jews with commerce and this seems to have been one source of his hatred of Judaism and his conviction that the \"Jewish spirit\" stood in the way of Germany's redemption.</p> <p>In Judentum in Music (Jewishness in Music), published under a pseudonym in 1850, Wagner attacked the \"Judaisation of modern art\". He blamed Jewish composers and performers for the commercialisation of music. Great music, he asserted, grew out of an artist's roots in his people and their culture. Authentic Jewish music from the synagogue was simply awful, but assimilated Jews who aspired to follow in the footsteps of Beethoven only produced pale imitations or pastiche. The \"mentally inbred Jewish intelligentsia\" found an audience for their work because they had already succeeded in corrupting public taste.</p> <p>Personal emnity and professional jealousy played some part in this attack which came at a time when Wagner's career was in the doldrums. But Wagner called for a \"war of liberation\" against Jewish influence in culture as a whole.</p> <p>These views were not an abberation. He republished his polemic in 1869, this time under his own name, and added a vitriolic appendix denouncing the \"yoke of the ruling Jewish society\". By this time he was convinced that Jews were seeking to dominate the whole of German and European society.</p> <p>During the 1870s, Wagner fell under the dual influences of the philosopher Schopenhauer and the pioneer of \"racial science\" Count Joseph Gobineau. From Schopenhauer he derived the idea that Christianity was polluted by its Jewish origins and required purification. Gobineau supplied similar ideas with regard to the German \"race\". Wagner conflated the two in his 1881 opera Parsifal whose eponymous hero is an aryanised, racially pure Christ-figure who seeks the redemption of mankind.</p> <p>Throughout his operatic writing and his essays Wagner elaborated the nature of German-ness and extolled the German \"volk\". To this noble race whose heroes he drew from German mythology he counter-posed money-grubbing, misshapen dwarves. Their characteristics seem to have come from the anti-semitic writing of Bakunin and Proudhon who he knew at various times. Wagner's artistic opus is so poisonous because it forms a compendium of German nationalism, racism, and anti-semitism.</p> <p>Wagner was one of the earliest systematic exponents of modern anti-semitism and if we honour the man and his music, we legitimate the hateful philosophy that is at the core of all that he created.</p> <p>\u0095 David Cesarani is professor of modern Jewish history at the University of Southampton.</p> <p><b>Related article</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,388727,00.html\">October 27: Is Israel ready for Wagner?</a></p>",

It was common in the 1840s to identify Jews with commerce and this seems to have been one source of his hatred of Judaism and his conviction that the \"Jewish spirit\" stood in the way of Germany's redemption. In Judentum in Music (Jewishness in Music), published under a pseudonym in 1850, Wagner attacked the \"Judaisation of modern art\". He blamed Jewish composers and performers for the commercialisation of music. Great music, he asserted, grew out of an artist's roots in his people and their culture. Authentic Jewish music from the synagogue was simply awful, but assimilated Jews who aspired to follow in the footsteps of Beethoven only produced pale imitations or pastiche. The \"mentally inbred Jewish intelligentsia\" found an audience for their work because they had already succeeded in corrupting public taste. Personal emnity and professional jealousy played some part in this attack which came at a time when Wagner's career was in the doldrums. But Wagner called for a \"war of liberation\" against Jewish influence in culture as a whole. These views were not an abberation. He republished his polemic in 1869, this time under his own name, and added a vitriolic appendix denouncing the \"yoke of the ruling Jewish society\". By this time he was convinced that Jews were seeking to dominate the whole of German and European society. During the 1870s, Wagner fell under the dual influences of the philosopher Schopenhauer and the pioneer of \"racial science\" Count Joseph Gobineau. From Schopenhauer he derived the idea that Christianity was polluted by its Jewish origins and required purification. Gobineau supplied similar ideas with regard to the German \"race\". Wagner conflated the two in his 1881 opera Parsifal whose eponymous hero is an aryanised, racially pure Christ-figure who seeks the redemption of mankind. Throughout his operatic writing and his essays Wagner elaborated the nature of German-ness and extolled the German \"volk\". To this noble race whose heroes he drew from German mythology he counter-posed money-grubbing, misshapen dwarves. Their characteristics seem to have come from the anti-semitic writing of Bakunin and Proudhon who he knew at various times. Wagner's artistic opus is so poisonous because it forms a compendium of German nationalism, racism, and anti-semitism. Wagner was one of the earliest systematic exponents of modern anti-semitism and if we honour the man and his music, we legitimate the hateful philosophy that is at the core of all that he created. \u0095 David Cesarani is professor of modern Jewish history at the University of Southampton.

But after that it was one-way traffic.</p> <p>Shahid Afridi greeted Graeme Hick by hoicking him for four over midwicket and depositing him into the stands over midwicket two balls later, and he brought up his 50 and Pakistan's 100 in Hick's next over with a powerful straight drive for four.

After 35 overs they had reached 148 for 3, having scored just 36 runs in their last 10 overs.</p> <p>England lost Marcus Trescothick for 65 in occasional legspinner Shahid Afridi's first over as he ventured down the pitch and flicked straight to Imran Nazir at midwicket (116 for 2) to end a stand of 50. </p> <p>Two overs later Graeme Hick produced one of the most witless pieces of cricket by an England player for a long time. He set off for a single, got half way down the wicket, hesitated as Shoaib Malik swooped in the covers, and then ambled towards the other end as if he had no chance. The ball missed the stumps but was collected by Nazir immediately behind them. But still Hick decided it wasn't worth running his bat in. Even when Nazir eventually broke the wicket, Hick was jogging in unconcerned, his bat in the air. The third umpire confirmed his fate and he left the field for 1 to make it 122 for 3. On a pitch as good as this no top-order batsman can afford to give his wicket away like that.</p> <p>Graham Thorpe and Hussain struggled to make much of the slow bowlers, but Hussain at least broke the shackles when he hit consecutive deliveries from Shahid Afridi to the cover boundary - the first in the air, the second along the ground. Abdur Razzaq replied with a maiden, just when England needed to accelerate, and although Hussain, who had taken 64 balls over his first 29 runs, spanked Azhar Mahmood through extra cover for four in the next over, England were losing their way.</p> <p> <strong> 25-over update</strong></p> <p>England had reached 112 for 1 after 25 overs in the second one-dayer at Lahore after being asked to bat by Pakistan. They lost Alec Stewart to the first ball of the 13th over as he tried to heave legspinner Mushtaq Ahmed's first ball across the line, missed, and was stumped by Moin Khan - as the third umpire Afzal Ahmed confirmed after what seemed an unnecessarily long time. Stewart had made 22 and England were 66 for 1.</p> <p>But that decision was made to look razor sharp by the one Afzal had to make in the next over. Marcus Trescothick pulled Saqlain Mushtaq towards square-leg where Saeed Anwar claimed the catch. Replays showed that if the ball didn't bounce in front of Anwar, then there was at the very least a good deal of doubt about it. But for five minutes Afzal dallied, watching the same angle again and again. Even an excitable crowd began to lose interest, and it was no surprise when the green light eventually came on.</p> <p>Nasser Hussain relieved the tension by hitting Saqlain straight for four and cut him to the boundary in his next over. Trescothick moved to an audacious run-a-ball 50 by slashing a Mushtaq Ahmed googly to the point boundary, but runs were proving harder to come by against the spinners than they had been against the new-ball attack of Wasim Akram and Abdur Razzaq.</p> <p>The 100 came up in the 22nd over as England consolidated their position. You had the feeling that anything less than 280 on this wicket would be very gettable. </p> <p><strong>12-over update</strong></p> <p>England were given a good start by Marcus Trescothick in the second one-day international at Lahore. After play started two hours early to lessen the effect of the evening dew on the bowlers' grips, Pakistan won the toss and asked England to bat. After 12 overs they had raced to 66 for 0, with Trescothick unbeaten on 38, and Alec Stewart not out 22.</p> <p>Wasim Akram began with four wides in his first over, but it wasn't until the fourth of the innings, bowled by Abdur Razzaq (Waqar Younis was dropped for Azhar Mahmood) that England found the boundary as Trescothick used his feet to bash a one-bounce four over long-off. Two balls later he lifted Razzaq over long-on for six.</p> <p>Stewart didn't get off the mark until the fifth over, and in the sixth, Trescothick, looking to attack almost every ball, cut a short, wide delivery from Razzaq to the point boundary. Stewart mowed Wasim over wide mid-on for four, before Trescothick, who played and missed occasionally, hoicked Mahmood over midwicket in the 10th over. The 50 came up at the end of the same over, and England were rocketing away. </p> <p>Seven of the last nine sides to bat second here in one-day internationals have won, but England had given themselves a great position from which they could think about upsetting the odds.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>A 40-year-old man was today acquitted of killing his former partner who died after swallowing concentrated sulphuric acid.</p> <p>Andrew Gardner, a unemployed laboratory technician, denied murdering 27-year-old Dr Karenina Longe, who died after swallowing drain-cleaning fluid at the home they had shared in Sheldon, Birmingham, on February 5 this year.</p> <p>A jury at Birmingham crown court took more than 12 hours to clear Mr Gardner of murder and a further 90 minutes to find him not guilty of an alternative charge of manslaughter.</p> <p>Mr Gardner closed his eyes as the jury of eight men and four women returned their not guilty verdict on the murder charge.</p> <p>The family of the Zimbabwe-born former choirboy and soldier wept as he was cleared on the second charge.</p> <p>Nigerian-born Longe died at Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital, where she worked as a senior house officer, 15 hours after becoming ill.</p> <p>After the second not guilty verdict was delivered, Mr Gardner stood with his head bowed in the dock as Longe's mother shouted: \"There's no justice!\"</p> <p>Carole Longe, 56, fought back tears as she added: \"There's no justice here at all. Where's the justice? I can't see any justice in this court at all.</p> <p>\"This is nonsense, it's absolutely farcical. Where is the justice in the British legal system?\"</p> <p>Another of Longe's relatives pointed at Mr Gardner and shouted towards the jury: \"Find out about him!\"</p> <p>During the 10-day trial, the prosecution claimed that Mr Gardner had somehow tricked Longe into taking the acid.</p> <p>The couple had split the previous week after he hit her in the face and kneed her in the stomach following an argument.</p> <p>The prosecution alleged that it was inconceivable that the intelligent medic would have knowingly taken the substance and Mr Gardner's lies to doctors, plumbers and police, which he admitted during interviews with officers, were a sign of his guilt.</p> <p>But his defence counsel Courtnay Griffiths QC, said that the medic may have been under pressure from work and as she studied for the second part of her Royal College of Physicians exams.</p> <p>In his closing speech, Mr Griffiths told the jury that it was not inconceivable for people to commit suicide or do \"outlandish things\" without giving any sign beforehand.</p> <p>Suicide or a deliberate attempt to harm herself was the only explanation based on hard evidence as there was no sign of force, the bottle was clearly visible and Dr Longe never once accused Mr Gardner of giving the acid to her.</p> <p>The lawyer said that, while looking as if she was coping, the medic was under extreme pressure at work, domestically and financially.</p> <p>But Mr Gardner, despite his drink problem, children from another relationship and lack of job, was an \"obsession\" for her and she may have drunk the acid as a \"last vain attempt\" to get him to notice her, Mr Griffiths suggested.</p> <p>He said that he could understand why Longe's mother could not believe why her daughter stayed with him for five years, but the suspicions she had when he was not at the hospital did not mean he murdered her.</p> <p>\"Carole Longe had every right to be suspicious. The police, having spoken to her, equally had every right to be suspicious. But suspicion is a million miles away from proof,\" Mr Griffiths said.</p> <p>Highlighting Mr Gardner's lies and contradictions in his account of what happened that day, he added that, if he had committed the murder, why did he call four people before ringing for an ambulance instead of fleeing the country.</p> <p>The 23-minute delay in ringing the ambulance was a sign of Mr Gardner's confused and disorientated state, probably caused by alcohol, and he may have been trying to make sense of what was going on, the lawyer claimed.</p> <p>\"I'm not asking you to like this man, this alcoholic, this clear womaniser, this fickle individual, who left his 15-year-old boy to, in fact, clear up the mess, sponging off a stressed-out young female doctor.</p> <p>\"You've got good reason to dislike him. You may even feel he's responsible for her death. But responsibility for her death and guilt of her murder are two completely different things,\" he submitted.</p> <p>Mr Gardner's solicitor Mark Bowen said afterwards: \"Mr Gardner is happy and relieved that his ordeal is over. He will now try to rebuild his life with his family.</p> <p>\"He remains devastated by the suicide of Longe. We believe the prosecution was not based on hard evidence.

      "bodyText": "A 40-year-old man was today acquitted of killing his former partner who died after swallowing concentrated sulphuric acid. Andrew Gardner, a unemployed laboratory technician, denied murdering 27-year-old Dr Karenina Longe, who died after swallowing drain-cleaning fluid at the home they had shared in Sheldon, Birmingham, on February 5 this year. A jury at Birmingham crown court took more than 12 hours to clear Mr Gardner of murder and a further 90 minutes to find him not guilty of an alternative charge of manslaughter. Mr Gardner closed his eyes as the jury of eight men and four women returned their not guilty verdict on the murder charge. The family of the Zimbabwe-born former choirboy and soldier wept as he was cleared on the second charge. Nigerian-born Longe died at Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital, where she worked as a senior house officer, 15 hours after becoming ill. After the second not guilty verdict was delivered, Mr Gardner stood with his head bowed in the dock as Longe's mother shouted: \"There's no justice!\" Carole Longe, 56, fought back tears as she added: \"There's no justice here at all. Where's the justice? I can't see any justice in this court at all. \"This is nonsense, it's absolutely farcical. Where is the justice in the British legal system?\" Another of Longe's relatives pointed at Mr Gardner and shouted towards the jury: \"Find out about him!\" During the 10-day trial, the prosecution claimed that Mr Gardner had somehow tricked Longe into taking the acid. The couple had split the previous week after he hit her in the face and kneed her in the stomach following an argument. The prosecution alleged that it was inconceivable that the intelligent medic would have knowingly taken the substance and Mr Gardner's lies to doctors, plumbers and police, which he admitted during interviews with officers, were a sign of his guilt. But his defence counsel Courtnay Griffiths QC, said that the medic may have been under pressure from work and as she studied for the second part of her Royal College of Physicians exams. In his closing speech, Mr Griffiths told the jury that it was not inconceivable for people to commit suicide or do \"outlandish things\" without giving any sign beforehand. Suicide or a deliberate attempt to harm herself was the only explanation based on hard evidence as there was no sign of force, the bottle was clearly visible and Dr Longe never once accused Mr Gardner of giving the acid to her. The lawyer said that, while looking as if she was coping, the medic was under extreme pressure at work, domestically and financially. But Mr Gardner, despite his drink problem, children from another relationship and lack of job, was an \"obsession\" for her and she may have drunk the acid as a \"last vain attempt\" to get him to notice her, Mr Griffiths suggested. He said that he could understand why Longe's mother could not believe why her daughter stayed with him for five years, but the suspicions she had when he was not at the hospital did not mean he murdered her. \"Carole Longe had every right to be suspicious. The police, having spoken to her, equally had every right to be suspicious. But suspicion is a million miles away from proof,\" Mr Griffiths said. Highlighting Mr Gardner's lies and contradictions in his account of what happened that day, he added that, if he had committed the murder, why did he call four people before ringing for an ambulance instead of fleeing the country. The 23-minute delay in ringing the ambulance was a sign of Mr Gardner's confused and disorientated state, probably caused by alcohol, and he may have been trying to make sense of what was going on, the lawyer claimed. \"I'm not asking you to like this man, this alcoholic, this clear womaniser, this fickle individual, who left his 15-year-old boy to, in fact, clear up the mess, sponging off a stressed-out young female doctor. \"You've got good reason to dislike him. You may even feel he's responsible for her death. But responsibility for her death and guilt of her murder are two completely different things,\" he submitted. Mr Gardner's solicitor Mark Bowen said afterwards: \"Mr Gardner is happy and relieved that his ordeal is over. He will now try to rebuild his life with his family. \"He remains devastated by the suicide of Longe. We believe the prosecution was not based on hard evidence. It was based on pandering to people's emotions. A criminal prosecution should be based on hard evidence. \"We are therefore grateful to the jury for preventing a miscarriage of justice. This reiterates the importance of the jury system and the government should take note.\" Mr Bowen said his client criticised the \"appalling and oppressive\" conditions at Winson Green, Birmingham, where he was held on remand following his arrest and called for the institution to be closed down. Speaking on the steps of the court, Ms Longe maintained that her daughter would not commit suicide. \"Everybody who knows her knows she was a young woman who had everything to live for,\" Ms Longe said. She then left with her eldest daughter Samantha, 31, and other members of her family and friends. Carole and Samantha Longe sat stoically in the front row of the public gallery every day of the harrowing trial, holding on to one another for comfort and shedding countless tears. But Longe's mother and sister said they were determined to overcome their grief and loss. Samantha Longe, 31, said: \"She was a very strong, determined, energetic person. I have looked at and tried to look at things the way I think she would have done and tried to manage the way I think she would have done. \"I know that Nina wouldn't want us to become bitter and arguing and resentful and beaten, defeated, negative. \"These feelings have come but they won't remain. She wouldn't have got any satisfaction if she thought we'd given up. \"We decided for ourselves and for Nina that we will come through this and we will come through it because we have to and because we want to. We want to live and enjoy the rest of our lives with each other.\" The family has set up the Dr Nina Longe Africa Bursary to assist doctors who want to further their training and research in tropical medicine, infectious diseases or Aids. The \u00a31,000 award, open to candidates at Birmingham's Heartlands and Solihull hospitals, will be made yearly.",

Alarmed, they investigated and discovered that those internal passwords were being used to transfer secret source code from the US company's computer network in Redmond, Washington. <p><b>What is source code?</b><br> It's the computer language which is used to build Microsoft's software programs such as Word and Office, the leading programs used by businesses throughout the world.</p> <p><b>But surely Microsoft have tight security - how did the hackers penetrate it?</b><br> Experts believe they used a program called QAZ Trojan. In principle this works like the Trojan Horse from Greek myth in so far as it sneaks into computers under camouflage before wreaking havoc. </p> <p>First the hacker sends a seemingly innocuous file via email to an unsuspecting person. But hidden within is an insidious program which can infiltrate the computer of the user who opened it. Once it has embedded itself in the machine, the program becomes a \"back door\" for hackers.

      "bodyText": "What happened? Microsoft security employees noticed passwords being remotely sent to an email account in St Petersburg, Russia, on Wednesday. Alarmed, they investigated and discovered that those internal passwords were being used to transfer secret source code from the US company's computer network in Redmond, Washington. What is source code? It's the computer language which is used to build Microsoft's software programs such as Word and Office, the leading programs used by businesses throughout the world. But surely Microsoft have tight security - how did the hackers penetrate it? Experts believe they used a program called QAZ Trojan. In principle this works like the Trojan Horse from Greek myth in so far as it sneaks into computers under camouflage before wreaking havoc. First the hacker sends a seemingly innocuous file via email to an unsuspecting person. But hidden within is an insidious program which can infiltrate the computer of the user who opened it. Once it has embedded itself in the machine, the program becomes a \"back door\" for hackers. It gives them limited control of the machine. They can bide their time before doing anything, root around the system for passwords, find them and then email information to themselves. Why would they want it? Microsoft is saying it is not exactly sure and has denied that any of its upcoming software blueprints - including a new version of its Windows operating system - have been stolen.

Does English literature, or Anglo-American literature, have a special meaning for you?</p> <p><strong>Ruth Prawer Jhabvala:</strong> Well, I was very lucky to come here when I did, I was also very lucky to have the years of doing nothing but reading, mostly English literature. So my whole background is that. It was extremely fortunate for me. Also English became my first language.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you think studying literature is a better preparation for writing screenplays, or at any rate adapting classics for the screen, than going to film school would be?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I started off and still am primarily a novelist, and not a screen writer. Studying English literature is really not studying - to have all those years to read is a gift. Particularly as I wasn't really very good at anything... It was wonderful to have all those years to read. But I will say that while I was preparing for my degree I never wrote. I wrote before and after, but during those years I just read. I even wrote a thesis on the short story in England from 1700-1750. There weren't any of course but that was my thesis!</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you think that studying literature at university is why you were interested in adapting classics? </p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I was never interested in adapting classics at all. I've written four novels. I was never interested in film. Never. I never even thought of it. I wasn't even a film buff, I didn't see many films ever. I never thought of it until Merchant Ivory came to India and filmed one of my books - they said 'Why don't you write the screenplay?' and I said, 'Well, I've never written a screenplay and I haven't seen many films', because I was in India by that time and hadn't really had any opportunity to see new films or art films or classic films or anything. So they said, 'Well try. We haven't made a feature film before.' So that was really my introduction into film.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Is there a main purpose in adapting classics for film?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> The main purpose is, well, you have to, well the main purpose is that I have such a good time - I mean think of all that marvellous material. Just think of spending all that time in The Golden Bowl and other James and Forster books we have done. But especially Henry James because, not so much in Golden Bowl, but the other two [The Europeans, The Bostonians] - he has such marvellous characters and he has such strong dramatic scenes. You just put your hand in and pull them out.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> There isn't an educational impulse?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I'm afraid not! Maybe there should be, but I'm afraid I only think of myself.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I suppose you are trying to communicate your enjoyment?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes, yes. I suppose, yes. And in a way it's a homage to a great author. You know I never write any critical articles or critical reviews, never write anything except fiction and screenplays, so it is a kind of homage. But I never think I'm doing a public service or anything... [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj1.ra\">Soundclip 1</a></strong>]</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you have any idea why American literary classics from the turn of the century seem to be so fashionable at the moment?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Is Henry James particularly fashionable? Well let me think. Well yes, I think so.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Over the last few years...</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes. Well, it is such grand material, wonderful scenes, great characters, such wonderful relationships between the characters - well the material is there.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The French director Jacques Rivette said in 1974 that James is one of the 'unfilmable' authors, who 'can be filmed diagonally, taking up their themes, but never literally'. You obviously don't agree... </p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, I do agree! Any adaptation you do it diagonally. You can take up the theme but you can never, never, never do it literally. You'd come up with a kind of travesty, if you tried to interpret anything literally.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> But fidelity, is that important?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Fidelity is not the first [thing] No I don't think so. Like I said, the theme and the feel of the characters the ambience and their relationships that is what you try and but never, never literally. </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So it's a separate work, really?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> In a way. I'll tell you what I usually do. I read the book several times, usually it's a book I know very well anyway, but I read it several times and make some notes and make a kind of plan that I think I would want to follow - usually I don't, it breaks down at some point - and then I put the book away and really don't look at it again until I've filled out my own thing. And then I look at it again and see what I have missed. But there is a period when the book and I are two separate entities.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How much changing do you do when you go back to the book at that stage? Or what kinds of things do you change?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Nothing really - usually I find that I look for some poignancy or some scene that might contribute more, that might point something out that should be there in the screenplay. I try and find that. Or even just half a line of dialogue can be a God-send to me at that point.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How well do you find Henry James' dialogue works?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, again, it works diagonally. You really have to transcribe it. He's not the only person - all the others - you can never just take it off the page. However colloquial the language might sound, this is not how actors can speak. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj2.ra\">Soundclip 2</a></strong>]</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Could I ask what you liked or what you didn't like about any of the recent James adaptations?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I like Portrait of a Lady very much, and that was a book we had wanted to do over 20 years ago, but we never had the money for it. We did two other Jameses, it was easier, we started with The Europeans because that was all in America so it was much easier and a much smaller film so it was much easier to raise the money. And then again with The Bostonians, that was all in America, easier for us to shoot. Then other things came in-between and Portrait of a Lady went I'm afraid.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Did you ever get as far as a script?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I really should congratulate you on making a film, and on getting a film made, of The Golden Bowl at all. Was it hard work getting it made? </p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> To get it made? Um, well, no, we got, well people said 'This is not a good novel' or 'This is not one of Henry James' really good novels'. They didn't want to go ahead with it. But we did get money for the screenplay, money for the development, and once we had that we didn't have too much difficulty.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How did you pitch the story?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I wrote a sort of outline of the book - how we were going to see it and a background of the characters - and that's what we sent out. Because I didn't really expect anyone to have read the book. </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Was there an emphasis that you thought was central to that?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, yes, I think that we said that this was a passionate encounter between four people, and we thought that might sound good to them. So if this had been our first second film or our third film we may have had more difficulty, but we did have a good [track] record, so people came forward and said, \"Well, it may not look like much, but, you know \" [laughs] But certainly if we had started out and it had been an early film, we might have had real difficulties.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> How different is The Golden Bowl to how you would have done it, say, straight after The Europeans?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I don't think it would have worked so well for me. No, I think I needed a lot more practice, because this was a very difficult script. This was the hardest. This was the nicest and the hardest. The only other one that has been equally difficult and equally rewarding was Mr and Mrs Bridge - I don't know if you know that one, by Evan S. Connell. Well it was two books actually, which we adapted into one. And that was one of my favourite films. But those two were the hardest.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> When Jack Pulman adapted The Golden Bowl for the BBC in 1972, in the famous version directed by James Cellan Jones, with Cyril Cusack, Daniel Massey and Gayle Hunnicutt, they had six 45-minute episodes - a total of four-and-a-half hours. At 130 minutes, your version is only half that length. Are you at all envious?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Oh no, no, no. Not at all. That's the difference between television and film, television rests so much on dialogue, not as visual as a film is. You can develop things much more slowly and carefully. But in a film, I mean you just couldn't do it. I wouldn't want to.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> But were there sections you would have liked to have taken longer on?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, not really. We were in a two-hour format. Since we did not have time for four or six hours, I thought, well we might as well adapt ourselves to what we have, and just take the essence of the situation and each incident and turn in the story. We couldn't dwell on it.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> You obviously have a wonderful working relationship with James Ivory. But late Henry James is notoriously ambiguous and difficult, and no two readers of The Golden Bowl read it quite the same way - in fact, a single reader often sees different things in it at each reading. Did you always see it the same way?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yeah. I think we must have done. I mean the screenplay - he read it, and he had some objections, but there was nothing fundamental. I don't think we ever had a fundamental difference of opinion.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Could you talk about how your process of collaboration with James Ivory works?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, when I lived in India and he lived in New York, or wherever he was, we did a lot through correspondence. But now we all live in New York... I am still so used to working on my own that I do several drafts for myself first and then send them to him to make marks in the margin. And then I rewrite, and this goes on over a few months. And then finally, before he really starts to get it all together, we sit together and see where we still might have disagreements. Then he goes and shoots the film - I have nothing to do with that - I only go along to see some rushes. But I will see the rough cut, which is usually twice the length of the final version, then I see it again, and we sit in the editing room for some time and, you know, fiddle about.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So you are involved in the editing?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes, I am involved in the editing but not in the actual production, or in the casting. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj3.ra\">Soundclip 3</a></strong>]</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Whose idea was it to begin the film in Renaissance Italy with the discovery of adultery and the killing of the lovers?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I put that in right from the beginning because I thought to myself, well how am I going to show who this prince is and where he comes from? So I read a lot of books about the Renaissance and I came across a story in which a duke actually does kill a stepmother who was involved with her stepson, so I thought, well that's a good background for this film! You can't do these sort of things in a film, but in television you could, you could say that [just] in dialogue. You know, [a narrator] could sit there and expound and talk about it and everyone could listen, but in a film you just can't do that.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The duke is one of the ancestors?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes. And then there is the slideshow [later in the film], of the families, and then the story of the duke is told.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Later on, in your story, the role of the duke seems to be closer to Adam Verver.</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well yes, you know, you're supposed to think that! </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> In the book, the figure of Adam Verver is ambiguous to the end, so that we don't ever really know whether he has any clear idea what's been going on, or whether he's a bit of a simple soul, all of whose subtlety is used solely on his business. In your film it seems to me we know very clearly that he knows [what's going on between his wife and stepson].</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> He's immensely clever. A man doesn't become a billionaire and a patron of the arts if he's dim!</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So that ambiguity</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> There is no ambiguity. How could he have become a billionaire? In the book he manipulates the entire situation - he and Maggie between them. He in silence, but he knew what everyone else was thinking.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I was struck by the sympathy with which you presented the predicament of the Ververs who, in much academic criticism since FR Leavis, are taken to be capitalistic vampires, an essentially incestuous father-daughter team, draining the passionate blood from their weaker partners. Do you think there's a sinister side to what the Ververs do in the book that doesn't appear in the film?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Not at all. I think Henry James loved Maggie Verver. He loves her and he enters into her more than any other character in any other novel. All of the passion that she has for the prince, this is Henry James' passion that he has given her. I really don't see this reinterpretation. Though I like Gore Vidal's introduction [to the Penguin edition*] very much, but I didn't really like his thesis that they are the manipulators, and the prince and Charlotte are the victims. In a way they are the victims because they are social victims, because they have nothing and are dependent on them. But that has nothing to do with the character of the Ververs, who are all goodness, and Henry James painted them as goodness, in a way that an earlier Bostonian knows goodness, I think. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj4.ra\">Soundclip 4</a></strong>]</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I admired your courage in actually having the golden bowl itself appear and also be discussed as a symbol. Could you say something about what it means for you?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well first of all it's an object, we had to have it there, it's a physical object, which one person buys and another does not. The moment when the golden bowl is delivered in the film is also the moment when she [Maggie] discovers about the relationship between Charlotte and her husband. The golden bowl itself - Fanny says she does not believe it - it has a crack, it's damaged, and Fanny says, 'Who would think? It looks so perfect?' And then she [Maggie] says 'yes, a perfect fake'. And that's how she sees the situation that has been created for her, her marriage, and her father's marriage in fact, is a perfect fake. Like the golden bowl. And shortly afterwards [Amerigo] asks, well, 'What do you want?' and she says, 'I want a happiness without a hole in it, I want the bowl without a crack'. So it's a perfect symbol for us, and in the film we do see it.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> You seem to agree with the idea that the man in the shop who sells Maggie the golden bowl, and intervenes decisively in the plot, is Henry James appearing in the action. Am I right?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, that was an accident.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Really? It was an accident? Because many critics think it intentional. [The shop owner] says 'my golden bowl' in a rather emphatic way.</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes he does look like [Henry James]. (laughs). But no, I never thought of that. Plus I wasn't there when he was cast.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> You also seemed to have rethought Prince Amerigo, making him less languid and passive than he appears in the book. I noticed that he drives his own car and has his chauffeur sit in the back; and he even wins a bicycle race. What is the logic behind that?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, you can't have a languid central character otherwise why would these two women be in love with him? You need some kind of driving force. [<strong><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/goldenbowl/102500rpj5.ra\">Soundclip 5</a></strong>]</p> <p>* * * </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> In the first edition of The Portrait of a Lady, Isabel first comes across Mme Merle playing Beethoven on the piano; in the revised edition it's Schubert, a more beautiful, sadder, less stirringly courageous composer. You have Charlotte play Adam Verver a Debussy Sarabande. Does that characterise her? [In the novel she just plays Adam some of his 'favourite things', unnamed (182).]</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, not at all. Charlotte plays very badly and Henry James says she plays like you would play a game of tennis, you know, correctly but... Debussy was at that time a modern composer, so... I think in Room With a View we had Schumann a lot</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Incidentally, you have Fanny near the end of the film tell the story of The Portrait of a Lady as if it's something that's happened to a friend - she's a friend of Isabel Osmond, nee Archer</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> You spotted that? Good! In fact I put it right in, and then she turns round and says, 'That dreadful husband, what was his name?' I had in fact put in his real name, but Jim [Ivory] thought that was going too far... so he used another name.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Was that a joke?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, I thought it was as good a story as any!</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So that's 20 years after the action of Portrait of a Lady?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you think Isabel is happy?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, no. I'm afraid not [laughs]. I think this is the one book with a happy ending.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The Golden Bowl? You think Charlotte is happy?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, yes. She is going to be one of these great patronesses of the arts like Isabella in The Bostonians, and he will probably die 20 years before her, and it will all be hers. </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Adam and Charlotte do seem here to have a marriage in which sex might happen. Is that right, and is she lying when she says to Amerigo that she will never have children?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I'm afraid there is something that we had to cut out there. She could not have children. We had that in one scene that we had to drop. In fact two scenes. There was one where she comes back from the doctor's and tells Adam that they all say the same thing, and he says 'Well, you know... '. And then there is another scene where she says, you know, 'I have been to Sir Matthew-this and Sir William-that and they all say the same thing'. She is barren. And in the book she says that she can't have a child but it is not her fault. But we didn't want to undermine Adam Verver's manhood! [laughs] Since we had Nick Nolte! It is very different from the book because in the book Adam Verver is not such a fine figure of a man.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Is there a literary critic on The Golden Bowl whose work you admire or agree with, or have been influenced by?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, I never read about anything, I always read the thing. I read around the social life and where it all came from, but it would disturb me to read other people's opinions I think. I really want to go to the text itself, or to how the text came about - the personal and social circumstances behind it.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> The book was published in 1904, but your action runs from 1903 to 1909. Were you inspired by the recent [1997] film of The Wings of the Dove, which also pushed its action forward to the end of the Edwardian period in order to get in those modern things - like the ballet you include? What is the ballet?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> It's an invention by an American choreographer called Carol Armitage with whom Jim has worked with before. Our usual composer, Richard Robbins wrote the music.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So it's a pastiche, like Bernard Herman's pastiche in Citizen Kane, the opera that Kane's second wife performs and fails to hit the top note?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Yes, it's completely a pastiche.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So Charlotte likes modern things and Adam doesn't?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, he's not very musical anyway, remember when she plays the piano, he's half asleep. Art is his thing, not music. With her everything would tend to be somewhat fashionable, like a woman like that would be today... </p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> So you think she doesn't have a deep appreciation of art?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> I don't think so, no. Although she will, already in the later scenes she has learnt a lot. And certainly when they reach America and start this museum, she is going to make herself a great expert. </p> <p>* * *</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> When Maggie brings the book out to Charlotte in the garden at the end, you introduce a detail that's not in the novel. Charlotte comments, 'I read something else by the same author. I found it rather contrived.' Is the book meant to be a book by James?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No! No, absolutely not. 'But the social scenes are well done', that's the next bit [of their conversation]. But no, absolutely not, never.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> I thought it might be James, because Charlotte wouldn't understand James.</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, no. I wouldn't do that.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Would Charlotte like James if she had read him?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, she might like early James - Daisy Miller - up to, well not The Europeans, too American, but the early ones that were really popular. She might even have read Portrait of a Lady - she's not a fool, although they do say a lot in the book that she's really stupid, and compared with the others perhaps she is, but she does have her wits about her.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> When they go to see [art dealer] Mr Guterman-Seuss, in the book it's supposed to be Brighton but you made it Camberwell. Why?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Well, we didn't want to take a trip to Brighton, and some London suburb was easier. In fact we did have a scene where he laid out the tiles and Adam Verver sees how appreciative Charlotte is of it and that bring him closer to proposing - as he did in Brighton - but we had to cut that scene out in editing. A lot gets lost! But you don't regret it afterwards, you really don't feel regret for the scenes that have gone.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> What other scenes were cut at editing stage?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> Oh, many! [laughs] Very, very many. At the beginning there were scenes about inviting Charlotte to stay at Fawns and how poor she is, and the prince listens to all of this, and how she had a great romance with somebody but no-one knows who it is, and the poor prince is having to sit there... but all that went. We don't cut scenes out because of length, we just want the scenes that really work for us. If you only have two hours the essence is what you come down to.</p> <p><strong>PH:</strong> Do you have any other James adaptations in mind?</p> <p><strong>RPJ:</strong> No, I don't think so. I think that The Golden Bowl is the ultimate for him, it's his last novel... so I don't think I'd particularly want to. There's none that I could think of now that I would want to do.

      "bodyText": "Ruth Prawer Jhabvala on: Her education and what her job entails | Purpose of film adaptation | Adapting Henry James for the screen | Getting The Golden Bowl made | Working with James Ivory | Developing the character of the Ververs | The symbolism of the golden bowl | The character of Prince Amerigo | The movie as a pastiche | The character of Charlotte Stant | Losing scenes | Philip Horne: Am I right in saying that after escaping from Nazi Germany you came to London in 1939, and later studied English at London University. Does English literature, or Anglo-American literature, have a special meaning for you? Ruth Prawer Jhabvala: Well, I was very lucky to come here when I did, I was also very lucky to have the years of doing nothing but reading, mostly English literature. So my whole background is that. It was extremely fortunate for me. Also English became my first language. PH: Do you think studying literature is a better preparation for writing screenplays, or at any rate adapting classics for the screen, than going to film school would be? RPJ: Well, I started off and still am primarily a novelist, and not a screen writer. Studying English literature is really not studying - to have all those years to read is a gift. Particularly as I wasn't really very good at anything... It was wonderful to have all those years to read. But I will say that while I was preparing for my degree I never wrote. I wrote before and after, but during those years I just read. I even wrote a thesis on the short story in England from 1700-1750. There weren't any of course but that was my thesis! PH: Do you think that studying literature at university is why you were interested in adapting classics? RPJ: I was never interested in adapting classics at all. I've written four novels. I was never interested in film. Never. I never even thought of it. I wasn't even a film buff, I didn't see many films ever. I never thought of it until Merchant Ivory came to India and filmed one of my books - they said 'Why don't you write the screenplay?' and I said, 'Well, I've never written a screenplay and I haven't seen many films', because I was in India by that time and hadn't really had any opportunity to see new films or art films or classic films or anything. So they said, 'Well try. We haven't made a feature film before.' So that was really my introduction into film. PH: Is there a main purpose in adapting classics for film? RPJ: The main purpose is, well, you have to, well the main purpose is that I have such a good time - I mean think of all that marvellous material. Just think of spending all that time in The Golden Bowl and other James and Forster books we have done. But especially Henry James because, not so much in Golden Bowl, but the other two [The Europeans, The Bostonians] - he has such marvellous characters and he has such strong dramatic scenes. You just put your hand in and pull them out. PH: There isn't an educational impulse? RPJ: I'm afraid not! Maybe there should be, but I'm afraid I only think of myself. PH: I suppose you are trying to communicate your enjoyment? RPJ: Yes, yes. I suppose, yes. And in a way it's a homage to a great author. You know I never write any critical articles or critical reviews, never write anything except fiction and screenplays, so it is a kind of homage. But I never think I'm doing a public service or anything... [Soundclip 1] PH: Do you have any idea why American literary classics from the turn of the century seem to be so fashionable at the moment? RPJ: Is Henry James particularly fashionable? Well let me think. Well yes, I think so. PH: Over the last few years... RPJ: Yes. Well, it is such grand material, wonderful scenes, great characters, such wonderful relationships between the characters - well the material is there. PH: The French director Jacques Rivette said in 1974 that James is one of the 'unfilmable' authors, who 'can be filmed diagonally, taking up their themes, but never literally'. You obviously don't agree... RPJ: No, I do agree! Any adaptation you do it diagonally. You can take up the theme but you can never, never, never do it literally. You'd come up with a kind of travesty, if you tried to interpret anything literally. PH: But fidelity, is that important? RPJ: Fidelity is not the first [thing] No I don't think so. Like I said, the theme and the feel of the characters the ambience and their relationships that is what you try and but never, never literally. PH: So it's a separate work, really? RPJ: In a way. I'll tell you what I usually do. I read the book several times, usually it's a book I know very well anyway, but I read it several times and make some notes and make a kind of plan that I think I would want to follow - usually I don't, it breaks down at some point - and then I put the book away and really don't look at it again until I've filled out my own thing. And then I look at it again and see what I have missed. But there is a period when the book and I are two separate entities. PH: How much changing do you do when you go back to the book at that stage? Or what kinds of things do you change? RPJ: Nothing really - usually I find that I look for some poignancy or some scene that might contribute more, that might point something out that should be there in the screenplay. I try and find that. Or even just half a line of dialogue can be a God-send to me at that point. PH: How well do you find Henry James' dialogue works? RPJ: Well, again, it works diagonally. You really have to transcribe it. He's not the only person - all the others - you can never just take it off the page. However colloquial the language might sound, this is not how actors can speak. [Soundclip 2] PH: Could I ask what you liked or what you didn't like about any of the recent James adaptations? RPJ: Well, I like Portrait of a Lady very much, and that was a book we had wanted to do over 20 years ago, but we never had the money for it. We did two other Jameses, it was easier, we started with The Europeans because that was all in America so it was much easier and a much smaller film so it was much easier to raise the money. And then again with The Bostonians, that was all in America, easier for us to shoot. Then other things came in-between and Portrait of a Lady went I'm afraid. PH: Did you ever get as far as a script? RPJ: No. PH: I really should congratulate you on making a film, and on getting a film made, of The Golden Bowl at all. Was it hard work getting it made? RPJ: To get it made? Um, well, no, we got, well people said 'This is not a good novel' or 'This is not one of Henry James' really good novels'. They didn't want to go ahead with it. But we did get money for the screenplay, money for the development, and once we had that we didn't have too much difficulty. PH: How did you pitch the story? RPJ: I wrote a sort of outline of the book - how we were going to see it and a background of the characters - and that's what we sent out. Because I didn't really expect anyone to have read the book. PH: Was there an emphasis that you thought was central to that? RPJ: Well, yes, I think that we said that this was a passionate encounter between four people, and we thought that might sound good to them. So if this had been our first second film or our third film we may have had more difficulty, but we did have a good [track] record, so people came forward and said, \"Well, it may not look like much, but, you know \" [laughs] But certainly if we had started out and it had been an early film, we might have had real difficulties. PH: How different is The Golden Bowl to how you would have done it, say, straight after The Europeans? RPJ: I don't think it would have worked so well for me. No, I think I needed a lot more practice, because this was a very difficult script. This was the hardest. This was the nicest and the hardest. The only other one that has been equally difficult and equally rewarding was Mr and Mrs Bridge - I don't know if you know that one, by Evan S. Connell. Well it was two books actually, which we adapted into one. And that was one of my favourite films. But those two were the hardest. PH: When Jack Pulman adapted The Golden Bowl for the BBC in 1972, in the famous version directed by James Cellan Jones, with Cyril Cusack, Daniel Massey and Gayle Hunnicutt, they had six 45-minute episodes - a total of four-and-a-half hours. At 130 minutes, your version is only half that length. Are you at all envious? RPJ: Oh no, no, no. Not at all. That's the difference between television and film, television rests so much on dialogue, not as visual as a film is. You can develop things much more slowly and carefully. But in a film, I mean you just couldn't do it. I wouldn't want to. PH: But were there sections you would have liked to have taken longer on? RPJ: No, not really. We were in a two-hour format. Since we did not have time for four or six hours, I thought, well we might as well adapt ourselves to what we have, and just take the essence of the situation and each incident and turn in the story. We couldn't dwell on it. PH: You obviously have a wonderful working relationship with James Ivory. But late Henry James is notoriously ambiguous and difficult, and no two readers of The Golden Bowl read it quite the same way - in fact, a single reader often sees different things in it at each reading. Did you always see it the same way? RPJ: Yeah. I think we must have done. I mean the screenplay - he read it, and he had some objections, but there was nothing fundamental. I don't think we ever had a fundamental difference of opinion. PH: Could you talk about how your process of collaboration with James Ivory works? RPJ: Well, when I lived in India and he lived in New York, or wherever he was, we did a lot through correspondence. But now we all live in New York... I am still so used to working on my own that I do several drafts for myself first and then send them to him to make marks in the margin. And then I rewrite, and this goes on over a few months. And then finally, before he really starts to get it all together, we sit together and see where we still might have disagreements. Then he goes and shoots the film - I have nothing to do with that - I only go along to see some rushes. But I will see the rough cut, which is usually twice the length of the final version, then I see it again, and we sit in the editing room for some time and, you know, fiddle about. PH: So you are involved in the editing? RPJ: Yes, I am involved in the editing but not in the actual production, or in the casting. [Soundclip 3] * * * PH: Whose idea was it to begin the film in Renaissance Italy with the discovery of adultery and the killing of the lovers? RPJ: Well, I put that in right from the beginning because I thought to myself, well how am I going to show who this prince is and where he comes from? So I read a lot of books about the Renaissance and I came across a story in which a duke actually does kill a stepmother who was involved with her stepson, so I thought, well that's a good background for this film! You can't do these sort of things in a film, but in television you could, you could say that [just] in dialogue. You know, [a narrator] could sit there and expound and talk about it and everyone could listen, but in a film you just can't do that. PH: The duke is one of the ancestors? RPJ: Yes. And then there is the slideshow [later in the film], of the families, and then the story of the duke is told. PH: Later on, in your story, the role of the duke seems to be closer to Adam Verver. RPJ: Well yes, you know, you're supposed to think that! PH: In the book, the figure of Adam Verver is ambiguous to the end, so that we don't ever really know whether he has any clear idea what's been going on, or whether he's a bit of a simple soul, all of whose subtlety is used solely on his business. In your film it seems to me we know very clearly that he knows [what's going on between his wife and stepson]. RPJ: He's immensely clever. A man doesn't become a billionaire and a patron of the arts if he's dim! PH: So that ambiguity RPJ: There is no ambiguity. How could he have become a billionaire? In the book he manipulates the entire situation - he and Maggie between them. He in silence, but he knew what everyone else was thinking. PH: I was struck by the sympathy with which you presented the predicament of the Ververs who, in much academic criticism since FR Leavis, are taken to be capitalistic vampires, an essentially incestuous father-daughter team, draining the passionate blood from their weaker partners. Do you think there's a sinister side to what the Ververs do in the book that doesn't appear in the film? RPJ: Not at all. I think Henry James loved Maggie Verver. He loves her and he enters into her more than any other character in any other novel. All of the passion that she has for the prince, this is Henry James' passion that he has given her. I really don't see this reinterpretation. Though I like Gore Vidal's introduction [to the Penguin edition*] very much, but I didn't really like his thesis that they are the manipulators, and the prince and Charlotte are the victims. In a way they are the victims because they are social victims, because they have nothing and are dependent on them. But that has nothing to do with the character of the Ververs, who are all goodness, and Henry James painted them as goodness, in a way that an earlier Bostonian knows goodness, I think. [Soundclip 4] PH: I admired your courage in actually having the golden bowl itself appear and also be discussed as a symbol. Could you say something about what it means for you? RPJ: Well first of all it's an object, we had to have it there, it's a physical object, which one person buys and another does not. The moment when the golden bowl is delivered in the film is also the moment when she [Maggie] discovers about the relationship between Charlotte and her husband. The golden bowl itself - Fanny says she does not believe it - it has a crack, it's damaged, and Fanny says, 'Who would think? It looks so perfect?' And then she [Maggie] says 'yes, a perfect fake'. And that's how she sees the situation that has been created for her, her marriage, and her father's marriage in fact, is a perfect fake. Like the golden bowl. And shortly afterwards [Amerigo] asks, well, 'What do you want?' and she says, 'I want a happiness without a hole in it, I want the bowl without a crack'. So it's a perfect symbol for us, and in the film we do see it. PH: You seem to agree with the idea that the man in the shop who sells Maggie the golden bowl, and intervenes decisively in the plot, is Henry James appearing in the action. Am I right? RPJ: No, that was an accident. PH: Really? It was an accident? Because many critics think it intentional. [The shop owner] says 'my golden bowl' in a rather emphatic way. RPJ: Yes he does look like [Henry James]. (laughs). But no, I never thought of that. Plus I wasn't there when he was cast. PH: You also seemed to have rethought Prince Amerigo, making him less languid and passive than he appears in the book. I noticed that he drives his own car and has his chauffeur sit in the back; and he even wins a bicycle race. What is the logic behind that? RPJ: Well, you can't have a languid central character otherwise why would these two women be in love with him? You need some kind of driving force. [Soundclip 5] * * * PH: In the first edition of The Portrait of a Lady, Isabel first comes across Mme Merle playing Beethoven on the piano; in the revised edition it's Schubert, a more beautiful, sadder, less stirringly courageous composer. You have Charlotte play Adam Verver a Debussy Sarabande. Does that characterise her? [In the novel she just plays Adam some of his 'favourite things', unnamed (182).] RPJ: No, not at all. Charlotte plays very badly and Henry James says she plays like you would play a game of tennis, you know, correctly but... Debussy was at that time a modern composer, so... I think in Room With a View we had Schumann a lot PH: Incidentally, you have Fanny near the end of the film tell the story of The Portrait of a Lady as if it's something that's happened to a friend - she's a friend of Isabel Osmond, nee Archer RPJ: You spotted that? Good! In fact I put it right in, and then she turns round and says, 'That dreadful husband, what was his name?' I had in fact put in his real name, but Jim [Ivory] thought that was going too far... so he used another name. PH: Was that a joke? RPJ: Well, I thought it was as good a story as any! PH: So that's 20 years after the action of Portrait of a Lady? RPJ: Yes. PH: Do you think Isabel is happy? RPJ: No, no. I'm afraid not [laughs]. I think this is the one book with a happy ending. PH: The Golden Bowl? You think Charlotte is happy? RPJ: Well, yes. She is going to be one of these great patronesses of the arts like Isabella in The Bostonians, and he will probably die 20 years before her, and it will all be hers. PH: Adam and Charlotte do seem here to have a marriage in which sex might happen. Is that right, and is she lying when she says to Amerigo that she will never have children? RPJ: I'm afraid there is something that we had to cut out there. She could not have children. We had that in one scene that we had to drop. In fact two scenes. There was one where she comes back from the doctor's and tells Adam that they all say the same thing, and he says 'Well, you know... '. And then there is another scene where she says, you know, 'I have been to Sir Matthew-this and Sir William-that and they all say the same thing'. She is barren. And in the book she says that she can't have a child but it is not her fault. But we didn't want to undermine Adam Verver's manhood! [laughs] Since we had Nick Nolte! It is very different from the book because in the book Adam Verver is not such a fine figure of a man. * * * PH: Is there a literary critic on The Golden Bowl whose work you admire or agree with, or have been influenced by? RPJ: No, I never read about anything, I always read the thing. I read around the social life and where it all came from, but it would disturb me to read other people's opinions I think. I really want to go to the text itself, or to how the text came about - the personal and social circumstances behind it. PH: The book was published in 1904, but your action runs from 1903 to 1909. Were you inspired by the recent [1997] film of The Wings of the Dove, which also pushed its action forward to the end of the Edwardian period in order to get in those modern things - like the ballet you include? What is the ballet? RPJ: It's an invention by an American choreographer called Carol Armitage with whom Jim has worked with before. Our usual composer, Richard Robbins wrote the music. PH: So it's a pastiche, like Bernard Herman's pastiche in Citizen Kane, the opera that Kane's second wife performs and fails to hit the top note? RPJ: Yes, it's completely a pastiche. PH: So Charlotte likes modern things and Adam doesn't? RPJ: Well, he's not very musical anyway, remember when she plays the piano, he's half asleep. Art is his thing, not music. With her everything would tend to be somewhat fashionable, like a woman like that would be today... PH: So you think she doesn't have a deep appreciation of art? RPJ: I don't think so, no. Although she will, already in the later scenes she has learnt a lot. And certainly when they reach America and start this museum, she is going to make herself a great expert. * * * PH: When Maggie brings the book out to Charlotte in the garden at the end, you introduce a detail that's not in the novel. Charlotte comments, 'I read something else by the same author. I found it rather contrived.' Is the book meant to be a book by James? RPJ: No! No, absolutely not. 'But the social scenes are well done', that's the next bit [of their conversation]. But no, absolutely not, never. PH: I thought it might be James, because Charlotte wouldn't understand James. RPJ: No, no. I wouldn't do that. PH: Would Charlotte like James if she had read him? RPJ: Well, she might like early James - Daisy Miller - up to, well not The Europeans, too American, but the early ones that were really popular. She might even have read Portrait of a Lady - she's not a fool, although they do say a lot in the book that she's really stupid, and compared with the others perhaps she is, but she does have her wits about her. PH: When they go to see [art dealer] Mr Guterman-Seuss, in the book it's supposed to be Brighton but you made it Camberwell. Why? RPJ: Well, we didn't want to take a trip to Brighton, and some London suburb was easier. In fact we did have a scene where he laid out the tiles and Adam Verver sees how appreciative Charlotte is of it and that bring him closer to proposing - as he did in Brighton - but we had to cut that scene out in editing. A lot gets lost! But you don't regret it afterwards, you really don't feel regret for the scenes that have gone. PH: What other scenes were cut at editing stage? RPJ: Oh, many! [laughs] Very, very many. At the beginning there were scenes about inviting Charlotte to stay at Fawns and how poor she is, and the prince listens to all of this, and how she had a great romance with somebody but no-one knows who it is, and the poor prince is having to sit there... but all that went. We don't cut scenes out because of length, we just want the scenes that really work for us. If you only have two hours the essence is what you come down to. PH: Do you have any other James adaptations in mind? RPJ: No, I don't think so. I think that The Golden Bowl is the ultimate for him, it's his last novel... so I don't think I'd particularly want to. There's none that I could think of now that I would want to do.

So I'm betting on a cagey one with a ricochet of Nick Barmby's arse deciding it. Which end that arse ends up in however, remains to be seen.</p>",

It was on the match between Aston Villa and Leicester City and I bet on one goal or less in the game. There were no goals and I won, but I still received a stern reprimand from Mr Patrick Murray for not backing the goalless draw. I've hedged my bets again this week though, mostly because I don't think the Merseyside derby will end without a goal. There was only one goal in last year's two encounters, but it was scored by Everton at Anfield. Everton also won away at Newcastle last week, and Liverpool have recently been struggling to stamp their authority on away teams. So I'm betting on a cagey one with a ricochet of Nick Barmby's arse deciding it. Which end that arse ends up in however, remains to be seen.",

Anything that includes the phrase \"greatest hits\" should mean the 17-20 best-selling singles bar none, not even that embarrassing collaboration with Keith Allen. \"Best of\" is code: it can mean some singles being contractually unavailable, or the exclusion of that Keith Allen collaboration, or that there are not enough proper hits to fill a CD single, let alone 75 minutes. In each case, randomly selected album tracks are used as padding. Anything including \"collector's\" means it is pitched at the bovine sector of an artist's fanbase, with an inevitable coda that while the said artist has been compiled too recently for commercial comfort, something has to be shoved out before the sales curve dips. \"Collector's\", however, should never be confused with \"collection\", which is typically a more comprehensive business. \"Anthology\", the close cousin of \"collection\", usually features a smattering of unlistenable demos and will sprawl its way through several decades. </p> <p>Sadly, record companies do not always tell the whole truth, and this is particularly the case in the seasonal rush to flood the market with single-artist compilations that HMV and Virgin might as well rack up as \"Christmas Presents\". <br> <strong> The Pretenders' Greatest Hits </strong>(Warner Esp, ****) is straightforward enough, with 20 tracks, all the top-40 hits and Chrissie Hynde's extra-curricular adventures with UB40 and Moodswings for ballast. The will-this-do? sleevenotes from Julie Burchill (\"The Pretenders could be clunky, po-faced, pious and some times embarrassing\") at least means Hynde need fear no reviews. </p> <p>Pointedly, <strong>Lenny Kravitz's</strong> 15-track, outrageously titled <strong>Greatest Hits </strong> (Virgin America, **) fails to trouble itself with sleevenotes at all.

A grim future, but hopefully a less silly haircut, beckon. </p> <p><strong>Shirley's Bassey's This Is My Life - The Greatest Hits </strong>(Liberty/EMI, **) cannily places the Propellerheads-helmed History Repeating second in the running order, in an attempt to Tom Jonesify her career; omitting her work with Yello and Chris Rea, however, is missing open goals. Big Spender and Goldfinger just about compensate for Climb Every Mountain, although these 22 tracks are the equivalent of being shouted at for 68 minutes. </p> <p><strong>Cliff Richard's The Whole Story - His Greatest Hits</strong> (EMI, **) spans 1958-99 over 46 tracks. It is the sort of \"whole\" story that includes Mistletoe &amp; Wine but omits Congratulations, although to compile his top-10 hits would take many more than two CDs. No sleevenotes: draw your own conclusions. My, he's looking old these days. </p> <p>Long dropped by Warner Bros,<strong> Ice-T </strong>avoids any potential sleevenote embarrassment by writing the extensive ones to the 17-track <strong>Greatest Hits: The Evidence </strong>(Warner Bros, ****) himself. For reasons that will forever remain unclear, he reviews all his albums. \"No one wants a good white kid understanding and identifying with the rage from the streets,\" he thunders, before including some of his good-white-kid-friendly thrash hobby band, Body Count. His voice, warm yet knowing even when swearing, is a thing of often unheralded beauty. </p> <p><strong>Spandau Ballet's Gold: The Best Of </strong> (EMI, ***) might as well be subtitled We Had an Award-Winning EastEnders Actor on Bass.

Twenty chart entries over one CD rather skimps it for a bizarrely maligned group who have had more than twice that, but it does include this Christmas's second chance to secure one of their two hits with Chrissie Hynde and an opportunity to re-evaluate the fabulous Bring Me Your Cup. </p> <p>Uncomfortably bestriding the worlds of greatest hits and best of are the mixed bags. The fifth best-selling female act ever, <strong>Reba McEntire </strong>sings like an angel. I'll Be (MCA Nashville, **) is a collection of \"great songs by great writers\", notwithstanding the fact that she has barely written a word or note in her life. It comprises nine tracks from her least country album, 1995's Starting Over, three new songs and a few oddities. Very strange. Stick to Greatest Hits Volumes I and II. </p> <p>Alas <strong>Celine Dion </strong>, pregnant at last, has her eye off the ball. Hence <strong>The Collector's Series Vol 1 </strong>(Epic, *). It is packed with out-takes and Spanish versions, but, for shame, has none of her work with Jim Steinman.

Yesterday's ruling means the boys, who were 10 years old when they beat James to death on a railway line in Liverpool in February 1993, are unlikely to be sent to a young offenders' institution or adult prison. James's mother, Denise Fergus, 33, sobbed as the high court ruling was delivered, and said later that she was \"disgusted and shocked\" by the decision, which meant Robert Thompson and Jon Venables had \"got away with murder\". \"Thompson and Venables never gave James a chance,\" she said. \"So far, they have enjoyed an easy life in a children's home.

The two boys have served their sentences in secure local authority accommodation. Former detective superintendent Albert Kirby, the retired police officer who brought them to justice, was \"flabbergasted\" that they could soon be free. \"Bearing in mind the premeditation and the severity, eight years is woefully inadequate,\" he said. The trial judge at Preston Crown Court, Mr Justice Morland, recommended an eight-year minimum sentence for what he called \"an act of unparalleled barbarity\". The then lord chief justice, Lord Taylor, increased the term to 10 years. But the European Court of Human Rights ruled the former home secretary, Michael Howard, acted illegally when he further increased the tariff to 15 years. In his ruling, Lord Woolf said the two boys had done everything to redeem themselves, although their crime remained \"horrendous\". He set an eight-year tariff, which means the boys could be eligible for release on February 21 2001. Lawyers for the two boys welcomed the ruling.

Celtic hit back almost immediately, David Sommeil bringing Larsson down in the area and the newly cropped Swede sending Ulrich Ram\u00e9 the wrong way from the spot. The Parkhead side could have made a dream start in the very first minute when Bobby Petta's cross was pushed out by Ram\u00e9 as far as Larsson, but the header went inches over. Then the visitors had their hearts in their mouths when they survived penalty claims after the Portuguese striker Pauleta went down under a challenge from Johan Mjallby. Paul Lambert had an effort cleared off the line by Grenet before the goals came, after which Lubo Moravcik lobbed just over the bar and after the break Ram\u00e9 did well to push a fierce right-foot shot from Didier Agathe past the post. However his opposite number, Jonathan Gould, almost blew it for Celtic in the 64th minute. Agathe brought down Dugarry just outside the area and Gould fumbled Lilian Laslandes' free-kick, but happily for the Celtic keeper the ball rolled wide of the post. Bordeaux: Ram\u00e9; Roche, Laslandes, Legwinski, Grenet, Sommeil, Diabate, Basto, Pauleta, Dugarry, Feindouno. Celtic: Gould; Boyd, McNamara, Valgaeren, Lambert, Petrov, Agathe, Petta, Moravcik, Mjallby, Larsson. Referee: TH Ovrebo (Norway).",

Food on the net www.souprecipe.com Weary of dining on lettuce leaves and vinaigrette? Fear not for it is now, unarguably, soup weather, and this here chirpy little site is fully equipped for the frozen-toed, blender-wielding population. You can wade through categories such as slow-cook, noodle, stews and gumbos, rifle through the alphabetical index, search for the Thai broth of your dreams, safe in the knowledge that there are hints galore if things go awry. Pros: more recipes than you can shake a stick at, including apricot, lentil, BLT, avgolemono, and pizza (it sounds crazy, but it might just work). Cons: Excrutiating puns are rife. Witness: \"Roux the Day\" and \"A-Maize-ing Corn Chowder\".",

At their best; that's the trouble. </p> <p>By a law now so ancient, antiquated and inadequate that it should be challenged in the European court of human rights for revision, a pork sausage in this country needs only to contain 65% meat, of which only 50% - a piffling 32.5% of the whole sausage - has to be lean meat. Let's say your sausage is 12cm long, which is a decent size of a snagger, and about 4cm wide. So 4cm of it will be meat you or I would recognise as being fit to eat, but what about the other 8cm - 67.5% ? </p> <p>Well, that could be made up of fat, skin, rind, gristle, sinew, rusk, soya, milk protein, salt, pepper and water. Yes, water. Water is cheap, you see. So 10% of the sausage can be rusk, but because cheap rusk swells up with even cheaper water, that could be 20% of your sausage by volume. </p> <p>Actually, it could be more than that because manufacturers can add phosphates, which increase water retention still further. That's before they start adding the antioxidants to stop fat going rancid; sulphur dioxide to prolong shelf life; dextrose to sweeten whatever tiny lean meat content there may be and to help browning; sodium caseinate to maintain colour and looks; and sodium ascorbate to give it a lovely look. Oh, and herbs and spices, of course. </p> <p>If this causes you to look at your breakfast staple or dinner delight with new eyes, it could be worse. That meat content could be the MRM - mechanically recovered meat - an industrially produced meat slurry made \"fit\" for human consumption by the magic of the food technology. Yes, of course it's cheap. </p> <p>Oh, and if you think that the standards are pretty low for pork sausages, then you should try beef ones. They have to contain only 50% meat. </p> <p>The trouble is, we're all too ready to tolerate this appalling state of affairs. A few years back we ran the Guardian Great Sausage Quest for The People's Sausage. It was one of the great exercises in consumer democracy.

And, let me tell you, those sausages added up to a truly colossal amount of fat, gristle and unmentionable substances. Although there were truly glorious examples of the sausage maker's art among them, it was remarkable how much unspeakable rubbish had misty-eyed devotees who swore by their qualities. </p> <p>However, when tasting blind, and when price was not an issue, your average, everyday sausage consumer knew quality when he or she tasted it. Each year the sausages that went through to the final were the best in each area. That is, they had the highest meat content, the best quality meat, natural casings and fresh herbs or spices, and were made by small-scale butchers. </p> <p>The moral of the story, it seems to me, is only buy your sausages when you can be certain of their provenance, and can go back and complain if they don't cut the mustard. It's true, too, that while sausages are user- friendly and consumer-friendly - and a doddle to cook - they do benefit from a modicum of respect. Never, for example, prick a British sausage. The principle of higher sausage cooking is to do so at a low, even heat. The heat must gradually permeate the filling, causing the fat to leach out through the semi-permeable skin, while keeping in the juices to maintain prime succulence. Too high a heat turns the juices to steam, causes the filling to swell rapidly and so burst the confines of the casing in an unseemly fashion. </p> <p>There are those who swear by the baking method, and those who even grill them. I will have none of these methods. I fry my sausages long and slow, for about an hour, turning maybe twice. The pan I use is an old friend, a heavy, cast-iron job, which has never seen a bubble of washing up liquid in its long and productive life, only very hot water. It is blackened with heat and age, the layers of grease fused into a natural non-stick surface.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>According to its publicity brochure, the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock is a place \"where something important happens every day\", and, judging by the attendance, Al Gore's speech there on a hot southern morning this week seemed to live up to the claim.</p> <p>Gore spoke with authority and passion about the case for a smaller, smarter federal government machine.</p> <p>No politician in modern US history has a better claim in this field than Gore. He pioneered it. He understands it. He believes in it. And he is interested in it. For Gore, the search for good government is something of a mission.</p> <p>But Gore's speech at the Excelsior summed up a lot of the Democratic nominee's wider problem as he battles to clamber past George W Bush's narrow but persistent lead in the presidential election.</p> <p>It was a microcosm of what is going wrong for Gore. He was giving the speech not because he wanted to, but because he had to.</p> <p>During the three presidential debates, Bush had managed to pin a 'big government' label on Gore.</p> <p>Like much of what Bush says, it was untrue. But like everything that Bush says, it served a purpose. The label stuck, and Gore's task this week was to shake himself free of it.</p> <p>As Gore spoke in the Excelsior, one's mind occasionally wandered up a few floors in the same building to something else important that happened in the hotel some nine and a half years ago.</p> <p>That was the day when a woman called Paula Jones was working on the registration desk at a conference in the Excelsior. Early in the afternoon, she got a message from an Arkansas state trooper that Governor Bill Clinton wanted to talk to her upstairs in his suite.</p> <p>She went upstairs - and the rest is history. (Though she famously told the governor that afternoon \"I'm not that kind of girl\", Paula Jones appears in a nude photospread in this month's Penthouse.)</p> <p>What happened in the hotel on May 8 1991 goes a long way towards explaining one of Gore's other big problems.</p> <p>In his speech in the Excelsior, Gore twice mentioned that he had been a member of the Clinton-Gore administration.</p> <p>Presumably this was out of deference to his Arkansas audience, since it was two more mentions of the word \"Clinton\" than Gore normally makes in his stump speeches.

      "bodyText": "According to its publicity brochure, the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock is a place \"where something important happens every day\", and, judging by the attendance, Al Gore's speech there on a hot southern morning this week seemed to live up to the claim. Gore spoke with authority and passion about the case for a smaller, smarter federal government machine. No politician in modern US history has a better claim in this field than Gore. He pioneered it. He understands it. He believes in it. And he is interested in it. For Gore, the search for good government is something of a mission. But Gore's speech at the Excelsior summed up a lot of the Democratic nominee's wider problem as he battles to clamber past George W Bush's narrow but persistent lead in the presidential election. It was a microcosm of what is going wrong for Gore. He was giving the speech not because he wanted to, but because he had to. During the three presidential debates, Bush had managed to pin a 'big government' label on Gore. Like much of what Bush says, it was untrue. But like everything that Bush says, it served a purpose. The label stuck, and Gore's task this week was to shake himself free of it. As Gore spoke in the Excelsior, one's mind occasionally wandered up a few floors in the same building to something else important that happened in the hotel some nine and a half years ago. That was the day when a woman called Paula Jones was working on the registration desk at a conference in the Excelsior. Early in the afternoon, she got a message from an Arkansas state trooper that Governor Bill Clinton wanted to talk to her upstairs in his suite. She went upstairs - and the rest is history. (Though she famously told the governor that afternoon \"I'm not that kind of girl\", Paula Jones appears in a nude photospread in this month's Penthouse.) What happened in the hotel on May 8 1991 goes a long way towards explaining one of Gore's other big problems. In his speech in the Excelsior, Gore twice mentioned that he had been a member of the Clinton-Gore administration. Presumably this was out of deference to his Arkansas audience, since it was two more mentions of the word \"Clinton\" than Gore normally makes in his stump speeches. Normally, he's just not that kind of boy. Gore's patent reluctance to having Clinton join him on the campaign trail has created massive anger in the White House and among Clinton's acolytes. The issue has been simmering at boiling point for several weeks, and Clinton himself has occasionally shown that he is straining to get out there to drum up the votes. But Gore is cautious for a reason. His polls tell him that Clinton is a double-edged weapon. People like the policies, but they mostly do not like the man, and Gore knows better than anyone that, if the two of them were to appear together on the stump, Clinton would eclipse him. Clinton, not Gore, would become the story. That, of course, is precisely what the Republicans want. It's important to remember that Gore's best phase of the campaign - possibly his only good phase at all - came after the Los Angeles Democratic convention when he strode up to the podium and said \"I stand here tonight as my own man.\" The weeks that followed were the one period in the election when Gore has enjoyed a clear lead over Bush. That's not to say that there is no vanity and pride involved for Gore in keeping Clinton at arm's length. There is. But his strategy makes sense for other reasons too. Next week, Clinton will finally be allowed out on to the campaign trail. He will go to California next Wednesday and will barnstorm through a series of other states in the days between then and election day, November 7. Other states under consideration by the Democrats include Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Kentucky. But at no point will he stand on the same platform as Gore. Notice, though, what kind of role Clinton will play. His task will be an attempt to woo middle-of-the-road voters, as many of the Clintonites might like to imagine. Bush has won those voters away now. Clinton's task will be to mobilise the core Democratic vote, especially the black and ethnic minority votes, and to ensure they do not turn to Ralph Nader. In the end, for the Democrats, this election is coming down to a desperate attempt to rally the traditional party around Gore. Unless they succeed, Bush looks increasingly like the winner.

The result has been an even greater work burden for Eurocrats and an agonisingly slow process on the accession ''chapters'' that have to be closed before a new member can join. And member states, you often hear commission officials saying, are not prepared to devote the extra resources to help Brussels cope with the burden - or spend the money to sell the idea to their own peoples. Worries about this are getting louder. Members of the European parliament have expressed concern about the absence of a target date. Officially, parliament wants 2004 to be the goal, and is warning against a new round of institutional reform that could set back the process even further. But at the same time there are calls for some countries to be denied transition periods - a standard EU device to ease the adoption of difficult measures. Part of that is a reluctance to hand out the sort of subsidies that farmers, especially in Poland, say are essential. It's a fairly gloomy picture. Verheugen himself has warned that failure would be catastrophic. So it was easy to sympathise with the frustration of a Polish official, watching wistfully as Germans celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall and the end of communism. ''It was lovely to watch their celebrations,'' she said sadly, ''but hard to reflect that it was us who started it all, with Solidarity, and we are in limbo still, waiting for Europe after all these years.''

      "bodyText": "Britain will come under \"very great\" pressure to bring its economic and tax policies into line with members of the European single currency, Chris Patten, the European commissioner for external relations, predicted last night. In a speech about democracy in Europe, the former Conservative party chairman and Hong Kong governor painted a stark picture of the dangers of marginalisation if Tony Blair does not take Britain into euroland. Speaking in Oxford, Mr Patten gave one of his strongest arguments yet about the logic of scrapping the pound in order to enhance, not destroy, British sovereignty. In January 2002 euro notes and coins will replace national currencies in 12 of the 15 EU member states, with Britain, Sweden and Denmark all now likely to stay out for the foreseeable future. \"Britain is no longer part of the inner circle of economic policy-making in the EU - the so-called eurogroup,\" Mr Patten said. \"British diplomats hover about outside the eurogroup and pick up what scraps they can about plans for economic and monetary policy but they have no say.\" Mr Patten pointed to growing pressure for closer economic coordination in the EU, a key reason for Britain's attempt to prevent the emergence of arrangements for a \"two-speed Europe\" in the Treaty of Nice in December. \"Britain can resist indefinitely the extension of majority voting to new areas, and thereby maintain her veto on sensitive issues like tax,\" he said. \"But as greater consensus begins to develop in the eurogroup on economic, monetary and even fiscal issues, I suspect that the economic and competitive pressures upon Britain to come into line, in her own interest, could become very great.\" Failure to join euroland could also mean the Group of Seven forum of the big European countries, the US and Japan would give way to a \"G3\" that would coordinate between those with responsibility for management of the dollar, the euro and the yen. \"Would we still be invited to dine at the high table if we were outside the euro zone?\" Mr Patten backed the idea, put forward by the prime minister in Warsaw this month, for a \"statement of principles\" or \"charter of competences\" that would define where the boundaries lie between the nation state and the EU. That would spell out that the EU is now a \"mature institution which has achieved the broad balance it seeks between national and European powers\". His comments came as a European commission survey said Britons know less about the EU than any of their continental counterparts. An alarming 40% admitted that they knew \"almost nothing\" about the EU, 39% said they knew only \"a little\", while just 2% were able to boast that they knew \"a great deal\". The reason for such ignorance is buried in the same survey which reveals that the British public believes that much of its own press does not give the reader the full and fair story. Only 2% said UK media coverage of the EU is \"very fair\" while 27% judged EU reporting as \"not very fair\" or \"not at all fair\". Britons rate their press as less objective than 12 of the EU's 15 member states. Only the Portuguese consider that they are worse served by their media when it comes to the EU. Some of the report's findings - that public support for Britain's membership of the EU has plunged to its lowest level in 20 years - seeped out in July, but it was only yesterday that the full Eurobarometer report was released. Officials questioned 16,000 Europeans in April and May. Neil Kinnock, the EC's vice-president, said yesterday: \"This survey again underlines the lack of knowledge of the British public about Europe and their desire to know more. \"The most important source of information are newspapers and if several of them go on feeding people with myths it's not difficult to understand the knowledge deficit.\"",

Dominic Burns, director of sales for Eurosport, said: \"With France being the world and European champions, there is immense interest across Europe in seeing how they prepare for the next World Cup. \"AMD is looking to grow its profile in Europe and has selected sport, football and the World Cup qualifying process as the perfect environment in which to reach its target group, build awareness and boost brand values.\"",

      "body": "<p>Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, April 2 2000. A ceremony is being conducted at the war memorial erected to commemorate those who died when Japanese planes bombed the US's main Pacific naval base on December 7 1941 - \"a date that will live in infamy\", as Franklin D Roosevelt called it in his declaration of war against Japan the following day. Prayers are intoned, the grim events of that Sunday morning are invoked and wreaths are laid on the spot where one of four great battleships was sunk that day, with the death of 2,235 sailors and 68 civilians. </p> <p>But the gathering is also a kind of blessing for a great endeavour about to be undertaken by some of the ceremony's participants. Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer - the king of breaking glass and gigantic fireballs and a man with an inordinate fondness for retreading old movies and blowing things up - is about to embark on his latest project. In a $140m reprise of From Here To Eternity, Tora! Tora! Tora! and 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, Bruckheimer will get to bomb Pearl Harbor all over again. </p> <p>Prominent alongside him in the gathering are the movie's stars, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Cuba Gooding Jr and Kate Beckinsale. Bruckheimer and his alpha-male director Michael Bay stand side by side with the people who have helped make the movie happen: Hawaiian governor Ben Cayetano, the admiral in command of the US Pacific Fleet and, perhaps most importantly, Richard Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, which has given Pearl Harbor the largest budget ever approved in advance by a Hollywood studio. </p> <p>The high point of the ceremony comes when a fleet of planes that were all in use 59 years ago flies over the crowd. In the next month of location shooting, the islands of Hawaii and Oahu will be strafed anew by these and other aircraft and the islands' various air and naval bases will once more be littered with corpses, covered in blood and shrouded in smoke. It may only be a movie, but it's a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, which means that, much like December 7 1941, it will be brutal, ugly and loud - just how Jerry likes it. </p> <p>It has been a good year for Bruckheimer: three hit summer popcorn movies - Gone in 60 Seconds, Coyote Ugly and Remember the Titans - have relined his ample pockets. This follows five years in which he has knocked out one bombastic, testosterone-fuelled mega-hit after another: Bad Boys, Crimson Tide, Con Air, The Rock, Armageddon, Enemy of the State - all of them doing business in the $200m range, and often well above that. Bruckheimer's name and company logo - a point-of-view shot from a car doing 100mph down a lightning-flecked highway at dusk - have become synonymous with masculine aggression, massive explosions, high body counts, sub-Tarantino dialogue and sub-John Woo action spectacle. To those of tender sensibilities he is the devil incarnate, the man who helped destroy the movies, and an architect of our cultural stupidisation; but to those who sit in Hollywood's counting houses he's a man with his finger planted squarely on the moviegoing audience's collective clitoris. He is money. </p> <p>The last half-decade proves that Bruckheimer has emerged from the shadow of his boorish, bullying, narcotics-fuelled former partner Don Simpson, who taught the cautious, clean-cut Jerry what \"infamy\" was. An idiot savant whom Hollywood routinely and ridiculously dubbed \"a genius\", \"an intellectual\" and \"a philosopher\", Simpson pioneered the idea that movies should be simple, no matter if that meant they were also simple-minded. He and Bruckheimer earned millions from Flashdance, Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop. Together they developed a template for movie success that remains the standard operating procedure of producers searching for the lowest common denominator and the highest box-office receipts. </p> <p>Bruckheimer's post-Simpson movies don't deviate one iota from the formula they established together in the 80s. They usually have their origins in a magazine article - because who reads books in Hollywood? - which is then worked into a script by a number of writers, credited or otherwise, and polished by squadrons of rewrite men like Robert Towne or Scott Rosenberg. They don't build a story into something with bulk and weight; on the contrary, their job is to remove excess distractions until the script achieves Bruckheimer's desired degree of dumbness, a level of simplicity that can be fully summed up in a poster's 10-word tag-line. </p> <p>Next come the directors, of whom Bruckheimer has a loyal stable. These are usually ants-in-their-pants, edit-like-a-woodpecker-on-amphetamines directors like Tony Scott, Simon West and Michael Bay. They, like Simpson and Bruckheimer, have backgrounds in commercials or music videos, the two kinds of film-making that most resemble finished Bruckheimer products. Most of them are the kind of id-monster overdogs you'd expect to be helming big action flicks like these. Michael Bay keeps a 200lb mastiff near him at all times, and Tony Scott has an unnervingly Simpsonian fondness for big cars, big cigars and big breasts. </p> <p>The resulting, saturation-marketed movies are derivative in the extreme, and Bruckheimer has even started to cannibalise his own successes. Coyote Ugly, for instance, which was released in the UK last week, has the Flashdance formula: no stars, minimal storyline (hot babe chases big dreams), wall-to-wall MTV hits on the soundtrack, dance routines and an ample display of midriff and cleavage. Gone in 60 Seconds cashed in on the 70s car-chase genre, tapping the audience that flocked to John Frankenheimer's rubber-burning thriller Ronin. It's also a second stab at the speed-freak thrills of Simpson-Bruckheimer's brain-dead racing-car movie Days of Thunder. And Remember the Titans is a return to Dangerous Minds territory; both films feature teachers as heroes, and pupils as infinitely improvable productive citizens. </p> <p>Pearl Harbor, meanwhile, fits the New York Times's definition of Simpson-Bruckheimer's output as \"stitched together, like some cinematic Frankenstein monster, from the body parts of other movies\". Among those \"other movies\" are Bruckheimer's The Rock, Con Air and Armageddon, all of which feature an equivalent number of plane crashes and explosions. As the Los Angeles Times said of The Rock, Bruckheimer's movies, no matter how successful, \"epitomise trends in Hollywood film-making that have made many people very rich while impoverishing movie audiences around the world\". Are these the movies we deserve, or even desire? How did we come to this? </p> <p>Pearl Harbor is currently in post-production and is due for US release on memorial day 2001. Bruckheimer describes it as \"a sweeping, epic love story\" that encompasses both the raid on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo in early 1942. Affleck and Hartnett play marine buddies who both fall for American nurse Kate Beckinsale and both happen to be in Hawaii on December 7. That's about as much plot as Bruckheimer has ever needed to hang a movie on, and both the budget and the presence of the barnstorming Michael Bay would seem to guarantee that considerably more effort and intelligence have been applied to the special effects, big bangs, soundtrack and marketing blitz than to the story itself. </p> <p>But this time the stakes are rather higher. Bruckheimer, Bay and many crew members have deferred large parts of their salaries, and the producer and director face punitive income reductions should the film exceed Disney's budget. Actors will work for just above scale wages, and Bay won't even get a percentage of the profits. \"It's really, really tough,\" says Bay. \"But I knew you only get a chance to do an important movie like this maybe once or twice in your career.\" </p> <p>The $140m budget may seem gigantic, but Bay and Bruckheimer originally requested $180m. \"We all knew from the very beginning that we were dealing with scary numbers,\" says Todd Garner, of the Buena Vista Motion Picture Group. Garner and the Disney studio chief persuaded the film-makers to excise certain expensive scenes from the script, including a sequence involving exploding submarines. Shooting took place at Pearl Harbor itself - using thousands of naval men and women as extras - in Corpus Christi in Texas, where the 1941-vintage USS Lexington - doubling as both an American and a Japanese battleship - is now a floating museum, and in the same studio-built Mexican water tank used by James Cameron for Titanic. </p> <p>To cover his bases, Bruckheimer has elected to avoid the docu-drama approach of previous Pacific-theatre movies like Tora! Tora! Tora! and Midway. \"In Tora! you really didn't get to know a lot about the characters. It was just about the attack. It was very well done. Some of the battle sequences were terrific, and we certainly learned a lot from what they did - and what they did wrong. Pearl Harbor is not a documentary in any shape or form. We're trying to do what we did for Titans (which is based on a true story), and that's capture the essence of what happened.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, the spirit of James Jones's novel From Here to Eternity and the film adaptation by Fred Zinneman both seem to hang over the film. One early trailer goes so far as to replicate Eternity's famous love scene in the waves between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. But just to prove it's a bona fide Bruckheimer movie, the trailer also includes a shot of Ben Affleck in a speeding convertible with Japanese fighters screaming overhead. </p> <p>The harbour itself no longer exists, so a great deal of money was spent trying to recreate it. \"Anything done less than perfectly,\" says Garner, \"would be disrespectful to the Americans who lost their lives there.\" But the movie will attempt to avoid the kind of Yellow Peril race-baiting that disfigured many previous movies about the Pacific war. \"This is not a movie that says one side is good and the other side is bad for staging a sneak attack,\" says Ben Affleck. \"The story does take note of economic factors that may have contributed to the Japanese attacking. </p> <p>\"War is something awful, not something to celebrate. This story is really uncompromising and honest about what the survivors of the Japanese attack went through. I really believe the film will be the definitive piece about the attack.\" </p> <p>\"High concept\" is a misleading but much-used phrase in Hollywood. What it really means is \"low-brow\" or \"lowest common denominator\". What it means is a pitch that can be spun out to a studio moneyman in less than 30 seconds, such as \"Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito are... TWINS!\" Seven words. Millions of dollars trousered. In this way fortunes are made. The pitch is often cited as the purest distillation of high-concept. It was Don Simpson who invented high-concept. Long may he rot. </p> <p>Don and Jerry were close, but they were not twins, although they later marketed themselves as if they were. Simpson was the ideas factory, Jerry the man at ground zero, the nuts-and-bolts guy. Jerry was the reserved Midwestern Jew; Alaskan Don the wild'n'crazy guy. Don would refine scripts with writers, often sending script notes that exceeded the length of the scripts themselves. Top Gun endured 11 rewrites, and Beverly Hills Cop, so Simpson claimed, went through 38 drafts. Writers were dismissed like pizza-delivery boys or Simpson's hookers, and replaced with others cheaper and more malleable. </p> <p>When the script was adjusted, or dumbed down, to Simpson's satisfaction, he would hand over the production reins to Jerry and return to his steel and glass house to resume his bracing regimen of drug-abuse, cosmetic surgery and beating up and urinating on $5,000-a-night prostitutes from the stables of Madam Alex and Heidi Fleiss. He rarely visited the sets of their movies. This was Jerry's domain. </p> <p>\"I went to Don school and Don went to Jerry school,\" is how Bruckheimer put it. \"I didn't know the studio system. He was the system. He could walk into any meeting and know what the agenda was, what they were thinking, because he was one of them. But he didn't know how to make movies. He didn't have a clue. I had that expertise.\" </p> <p>They met at an industry screening of reggae-and-ganja flick The Harder They Come at the Hollywood Club in 1972. \"He was a publicist at Warner Bros at the time,\" remembers Bruckheimer, who had moved to Hollywood after a successful advertising career in Detroit and Madison Avenue. Simpson had also moved from the advertising business in San Francisco to work in Tinseltown, but was frustrated in his role. \"Shortly thereafter, I got divorced and needed a place to live,\" recalls Bruckheimer. \"He had a big house up in Laurel Canyon and one of his roommates had moved out, so I took one of the bedrooms there. I was making this movie and I was completely ragged and he'd sit in the kitchen and drill me because he loved movies. He hated what he was doing and wanted to get out of it. He was meeting young film-makers and hated running around getting coffee for everybody.\" </p> <p>Their house was filled with coke, hookers and top-shelf studio party-boys. Later Bruckheimer lent Simpson a jacket for an interview with Paramount suit Steve Tisch, and his career was under way. While Bruckheimer knocked out a series of low-budget, prestige pictures like The Culpepper Cattle Company and Farewell, My Lovely, Simpson installed himself at Paramount as one of the generation of executives under studio chief Barry Diller. Other future moguls at the studio were current Disney chairman Michael Eisner and DreamWorks founder Jeffrey Katzenberg. A torch had been passed along to this generation by Paramount's previous bosses, \"the Three Godfathers\" - producer Robert Evans, Gulf-Western CEO Charles Bludhorn and production honcho Frank Yablans. They were notorious enough for their excesses and successes, but Simpson would outstrip them all on both counts. </p> <p>The pair didn't come together as a production team until Flashdance in 1983. Once Adrian Lyne's arid little film - \"a two-hour music video\", in one critic's view; \"a two-hour commercial\", in another's - had debuted to $200m in receipts, Don and Jerry were on their way. They solidified their success by rewiring a stale old Sylvester Stallone script called Beverly Hills Cop, and by ripping off the Eddie Murphy character from Walter Hill's 48 Hrs, the template for the action-comedy-buddy formula so beloved of Simpson-Bruckheimer. Then they went one better - they hired Murphy himself to do it all again, with spectacular results at the box office. It netted $235m domestically and after two sequels the Beverly Hills Cop series made Paramount more than a billion dollars worldwide. It was the first action-comedy to make such sums, and laid the foundation for an entire genre. </p> <p>Top Gun's genesis couldn't have been simpler. This time it was Bruckheimer who found the magazine article, from which he took only the title. Simpson hired writer Chip Proser and showed him a photo which embodied the concept he was after. \"It was two guys in leather jackets and sunglasses standing in front of the biggest, fastest fucking airplane you ever saw in your life,\" Proser remembered. \"This is it,\" said Simpson, \"this is the concept.\" It wasn't even a pitch. It was just about enough for the poster it later became. But with Tom Cruise added to the formula, plus some flesh-heavy locker-room scenes and a lot of homoerotic aerial grab-ass, Simpson-Bruckheimer were able once again to cash in. </p> <p>Credentials thus established, they began to market themselves as a product. They appeared on the cover of Newsweek in matching black suits. They bought matching black Ferraris and matching black Mustang convertibles. They dressed in black Levis that they wore only once - Simpson said they quickly lost \"their essential blackness\". In a final act of power-drunk solipsism, they even hired identical (white) twins as their respective secretaries. \"It was so sick!\" remembered one of their employees. </p> <p>Sick or not, they were the embodiment of the go-go 80s in Hollywood. And they were arrogant. Pete Pettigrew, a retired admiral who served as technical advisor on Top Gun, once encountered Bruckheimer watching teenage sunbathers near the San Diego location. He said to Bruckheimer, \"I see. What you're doing is trying to get inside the heads of these teenyboppers and figure out what they want to see.\" </p> <p>\"Oh no,\" replied Jerry. \"You've got it backwards. Don and I dictate what they want to see.\" </p> <p>There was one thing terribly, terrifyingly wrong with this assessment: it was true. </p> <p> In the five years since Don Simpson died on the toilet with an Oliver Stone biography in his hands and no fewer than 39 prescription and recreational drugs in his bloodstream, Jerry Bruckheimer has proved that he's his own man.Simpson invented and fine-tuned a mind-numbingly straightforward way to make successful movies. Lower your sights, keep it dumb, keep it loud, have a tie-in soundtrack with a hit MTV video, then just market the hell out of it. Once Jerry got the hang of it, what was his need for Simpson? Though he never abandoned his old friend, there was no longer anything useful the Alaskan could teach him. Sooner or later, any fool can learn how to make movies stupider than they already are. </p> <p>The movies they made in the 80s are several degrees more moronic than those made by Bruckheimer alone both before and after their 14-year partnership. If you need proof, rent the excellent Farewell, My Lovely, one of the best Raymond Chandler adaptations ever. Now, with Don gone, Bruckheimer is making movies that do at least nod in the direction of narrative coherence and audience intelligence. Simpson would have shown an amusing, muscular writer like Scott (Con Air) Rosenberg the door. Bruckheimer has the sense to adapt to new trends in dialogue and action signalled by the successes of Tarantino and John Woo. </p> <p>But finally these movies - with or without Simpson's input - are nearly all designed to make skips full of money in the shortest time possible. To that end they are constructed around big guns, big government, big bangs and big tits, allied to whatever fleeting phenomena Bruckheimer deems worth exploiting. These include the millennium (read the comet in Armageddon), Reagan-era jingoism (Top Gun) and the downfall of the Soviet Union (Crimson Tide). Even Pearl Harbor owes its existence to a recent right-wing nostalgia for the generation that fought the second world war, a nostalgia that fed the John McCain campaign this summer as much as it spelled the success of Saving Private Ryan and anchorman Tom Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation. </p> <p>We live in an era that combines the fat complacency and political apathy of the Eisenhower 50s with the garish clothes, confusions and doubts of the late 70s. Somehow Jerry Bruckheimer resolves these contradictions and makes money out of them. He is truly the right movie producer for our blighted age. </p> <p>\u0095 Pearl Harbor will be released next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, April 2 2000. A ceremony is being conducted at the war memorial erected to commemorate those who died when Japanese planes bombed the US's main Pacific naval base on December 7 1941 - \"a date that will live in infamy\", as Franklin D Roosevelt called it in his declaration of war against Japan the following day. Prayers are intoned, the grim events of that Sunday morning are invoked and wreaths are laid on the spot where one of four great battleships was sunk that day, with the death of 2,235 sailors and 68 civilians. But the gathering is also a kind of blessing for a great endeavour about to be undertaken by some of the ceremony's participants. Hollywood producer Jerry Bruckheimer - the king of breaking glass and gigantic fireballs and a man with an inordinate fondness for retreading old movies and blowing things up - is about to embark on his latest project. In a $140m reprise of From Here To Eternity, Tora! Tora! Tora! and 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, Bruckheimer will get to bomb Pearl Harbor all over again. Prominent alongside him in the gathering are the movie's stars, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Cuba Gooding Jr and Kate Beckinsale. Bruckheimer and his alpha-male director Michael Bay stand side by side with the people who have helped make the movie happen: Hawaiian governor Ben Cayetano, the admiral in command of the US Pacific Fleet and, perhaps most importantly, Richard Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group, which has given Pearl Harbor the largest budget ever approved in advance by a Hollywood studio. The high point of the ceremony comes when a fleet of planes that were all in use 59 years ago flies over the crowd. In the next month of location shooting, the islands of Hawaii and Oahu will be strafed anew by these and other aircraft and the islands' various air and naval bases will once more be littered with corpses, covered in blood and shrouded in smoke. It may only be a movie, but it's a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, which means that, much like December 7 1941, it will be brutal, ugly and loud - just how Jerry likes it. It has been a good year for Bruckheimer: three hit summer popcorn movies - Gone in 60 Seconds, Coyote Ugly and Remember the Titans - have relined his ample pockets. This follows five years in which he has knocked out one bombastic, testosterone-fuelled mega-hit after another: Bad Boys, Crimson Tide, Con Air, The Rock, Armageddon, Enemy of the State - all of them doing business in the $200m range, and often well above that. Bruckheimer's name and company logo - a point-of-view shot from a car doing 100mph down a lightning-flecked highway at dusk - have become synonymous with masculine aggression, massive explosions, high body counts, sub-Tarantino dialogue and sub-John Woo action spectacle. To those of tender sensibilities he is the devil incarnate, the man who helped destroy the movies, and an architect of our cultural stupidisation; but to those who sit in Hollywood's counting houses he's a man with his finger planted squarely on the moviegoing audience's collective clitoris. He is money. The last half-decade proves that Bruckheimer has emerged from the shadow of his boorish, bullying, narcotics-fuelled former partner Don Simpson, who taught the cautious, clean-cut Jerry what \"infamy\" was. An idiot savant whom Hollywood routinely and ridiculously dubbed \"a genius\", \"an intellectual\" and \"a philosopher\", Simpson pioneered the idea that movies should be simple, no matter if that meant they were also simple-minded. He and Bruckheimer earned millions from Flashdance, Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop. Together they developed a template for movie success that remains the standard operating procedure of producers searching for the lowest common denominator and the highest box-office receipts. Bruckheimer's post-Simpson movies don't deviate one iota from the formula they established together in the 80s. They usually have their origins in a magazine article - because who reads books in Hollywood? - which is then worked into a script by a number of writers, credited or otherwise, and polished by squadrons of rewrite men like Robert Towne or Scott Rosenberg. They don't build a story into something with bulk and weight; on the contrary, their job is to remove excess distractions until the script achieves Bruckheimer's desired degree of dumbness, a level of simplicity that can be fully summed up in a poster's 10-word tag-line. Next come the directors, of whom Bruckheimer has a loyal stable. These are usually ants-in-their-pants, edit-like-a-woodpecker-on-amphetamines directors like Tony Scott, Simon West and Michael Bay. They, like Simpson and Bruckheimer, have backgrounds in commercials or music videos, the two kinds of film-making that most resemble finished Bruckheimer products. Most of them are the kind of id-monster overdogs you'd expect to be helming big action flicks like these. Michael Bay keeps a 200lb mastiff near him at all times, and Tony Scott has an unnervingly Simpsonian fondness for big cars, big cigars and big breasts. The resulting, saturation-marketed movies are derivative in the extreme, and Bruckheimer has even started to cannibalise his own successes. Coyote Ugly, for instance, which was released in the UK last week, has the Flashdance formula: no stars, minimal storyline (hot babe chases big dreams), wall-to-wall MTV hits on the soundtrack, dance routines and an ample display of midriff and cleavage. Gone in 60 Seconds cashed in on the 70s car-chase genre, tapping the audience that flocked to John Frankenheimer's rubber-burning thriller Ronin. It's also a second stab at the speed-freak thrills of Simpson-Bruckheimer's brain-dead racing-car movie Days of Thunder. And Remember the Titans is a return to Dangerous Minds territory; both films feature teachers as heroes, and pupils as infinitely improvable productive citizens. Pearl Harbor, meanwhile, fits the New York Times's definition of Simpson-Bruckheimer's output as \"stitched together, like some cinematic Frankenstein monster, from the body parts of other movies\". Among those \"other movies\" are Bruckheimer's The Rock, Con Air and Armageddon, all of which feature an equivalent number of plane crashes and explosions. As the Los Angeles Times said of The Rock, Bruckheimer's movies, no matter how successful, \"epitomise trends in Hollywood film-making that have made many people very rich while impoverishing movie audiences around the world\". Are these the movies we deserve, or even desire? How did we come to this? Pearl Harbor is currently in post-production and is due for US release on memorial day 2001. Bruckheimer describes it as \"a sweeping, epic love story\" that encompasses both the raid on Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raid on Tokyo in early 1942. Affleck and Hartnett play marine buddies who both fall for American nurse Kate Beckinsale and both happen to be in Hawaii on December 7. That's about as much plot as Bruckheimer has ever needed to hang a movie on, and both the budget and the presence of the barnstorming Michael Bay would seem to guarantee that considerably more effort and intelligence have been applied to the special effects, big bangs, soundtrack and marketing blitz than to the story itself. But this time the stakes are rather higher. Bruckheimer, Bay and many crew members have deferred large parts of their salaries, and the producer and director face punitive income reductions should the film exceed Disney's budget. Actors will work for just above scale wages, and Bay won't even get a percentage of the profits. \"It's really, really tough,\" says Bay. \"But I knew you only get a chance to do an important movie like this maybe once or twice in your career.\" The $140m budget may seem gigantic, but Bay and Bruckheimer originally requested $180m. \"We all knew from the very beginning that we were dealing with scary numbers,\" says Todd Garner, of the Buena Vista Motion Picture Group. Garner and the Disney studio chief persuaded the film-makers to excise certain expensive scenes from the script, including a sequence involving exploding submarines. Shooting took place at Pearl Harbor itself - using thousands of naval men and women as extras - in Corpus Christi in Texas, where the 1941-vintage USS Lexington - doubling as both an American and a Japanese battleship - is now a floating museum, and in the same studio-built Mexican water tank used by James Cameron for Titanic. To cover his bases, Bruckheimer has elected to avoid the docu-drama approach of previous Pacific-theatre movies like Tora! Tora! Tora! and Midway. \"In Tora! you really didn't get to know a lot about the characters. It was just about the attack. It was very well done. Some of the battle sequences were terrific, and we certainly learned a lot from what they did - and what they did wrong. Pearl Harbor is not a documentary in any shape or form. We're trying to do what we did for Titans (which is based on a true story), and that's capture the essence of what happened.\" Nonetheless, the spirit of James Jones's novel From Here to Eternity and the film adaptation by Fred Zinneman both seem to hang over the film. One early trailer goes so far as to replicate Eternity's famous love scene in the waves between Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. But just to prove it's a bona fide Bruckheimer movie, the trailer also includes a shot of Ben Affleck in a speeding convertible with Japanese fighters screaming overhead. The harbour itself no longer exists, so a great deal of money was spent trying to recreate it. \"Anything done less than perfectly,\" says Garner, \"would be disrespectful to the Americans who lost their lives there.\" But the movie will attempt to avoid the kind of Yellow Peril race-baiting that disfigured many previous movies about the Pacific war. \"This is not a movie that says one side is good and the other side is bad for staging a sneak attack,\" says Ben Affleck. \"The story does take note of economic factors that may have contributed to the Japanese attacking. \"War is something awful, not something to celebrate. This story is really uncompromising and honest about what the survivors of the Japanese attack went through. I really believe the film will be the definitive piece about the attack.\" \"High concept\" is a misleading but much-used phrase in Hollywood. What it really means is \"low-brow\" or \"lowest common denominator\". What it means is a pitch that can be spun out to a studio moneyman in less than 30 seconds, such as \"Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito are... TWINS!\" Seven words. Millions of dollars trousered. In this way fortunes are made. The pitch is often cited as the purest distillation of high-concept. It was Don Simpson who invented high-concept. Long may he rot. Don and Jerry were close, but they were not twins, although they later marketed themselves as if they were. Simpson was the ideas factory, Jerry the man at ground zero, the nuts-and-bolts guy. Jerry was the reserved Midwestern Jew; Alaskan Don the wild'n'crazy guy. Don would refine scripts with writers, often sending script notes that exceeded the length of the scripts themselves. Top Gun endured 11 rewrites, and Beverly Hills Cop, so Simpson claimed, went through 38 drafts. Writers were dismissed like pizza-delivery boys or Simpson's hookers, and replaced with others cheaper and more malleable. When the script was adjusted, or dumbed down, to Simpson's satisfaction, he would hand over the production reins to Jerry and return to his steel and glass house to resume his bracing regimen of drug-abuse, cosmetic surgery and beating up and urinating on $5,000-a-night prostitutes from the stables of Madam Alex and Heidi Fleiss. He rarely visited the sets of their movies. This was Jerry's domain. \"I went to Don school and Don went to Jerry school,\" is how Bruckheimer put it. \"I didn't know the studio system. He was the system. He could walk into any meeting and know what the agenda was, what they were thinking, because he was one of them. But he didn't know how to make movies. He didn't have a clue. I had that expertise.\" They met at an industry screening of reggae-and-ganja flick The Harder They Come at the Hollywood Club in 1972. \"He was a publicist at Warner Bros at the time,\" remembers Bruckheimer, who had moved to Hollywood after a successful advertising career in Detroit and Madison Avenue. Simpson had also moved from the advertising business in San Francisco to work in Tinseltown, but was frustrated in his role. \"Shortly thereafter, I got divorced and needed a place to live,\" recalls Bruckheimer. \"He had a big house up in Laurel Canyon and one of his roommates had moved out, so I took one of the bedrooms there. I was making this movie and I was completely ragged and he'd sit in the kitchen and drill me because he loved movies. He hated what he was doing and wanted to get out of it. He was meeting young film-makers and hated running around getting coffee for everybody.\" Their house was filled with coke, hookers and top-shelf studio party-boys. Later Bruckheimer lent Simpson a jacket for an interview with Paramount suit Steve Tisch, and his career was under way. While Bruckheimer knocked out a series of low-budget, prestige pictures like The Culpepper Cattle Company and Farewell, My Lovely, Simpson installed himself at Paramount as one of the generation of executives under studio chief Barry Diller. Other future moguls at the studio were current Disney chairman Michael Eisner and DreamWorks founder Jeffrey Katzenberg. A torch had been passed along to this generation by Paramount's previous bosses, \"the Three Godfathers\" - producer Robert Evans, Gulf-Western CEO Charles Bludhorn and production honcho Frank Yablans. They were notorious enough for their excesses and successes, but Simpson would outstrip them all on both counts. The pair didn't come together as a production team until Flashdance in 1983. Once Adrian Lyne's arid little film - \"a two-hour music video\", in one critic's view; \"a two-hour commercial\", in another's - had debuted to $200m in receipts, Don and Jerry were on their way. They solidified their success by rewiring a stale old Sylvester Stallone script called Beverly Hills Cop, and by ripping off the Eddie Murphy character from Walter Hill's 48 Hrs, the template for the action-comedy-buddy formula so beloved of Simpson-Bruckheimer. Then they went one better - they hired Murphy himself to do it all again, with spectacular results at the box office.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Now that you need no more than a digital video camera and a good idea, it should be easier than ever to become a film-maker; but as any old hand will tell you, there's more to filming than point-and-shoot. \"There's a whole generation that knows nothing about film-making beyond pressing a button on a camcorder,\" says Jeremy Ross, founder and director of the Advancement of Film Education Charitable Trust (Afect). </p> <p>Afect sees itself as something of a model for film education in this country, although it teeters on the brink of extinction and its scrounged 16mm equipment could be seen as outdated by today's fledgling auteurs. A small, independent school in King's Cross, London, it has become an institution in Britain's film-making community, both for its uniquely populist stance and its sheer tenacity. If you want to know more without giving up your day job, Ross is one of very few people who can help. \"I don't know much about the Dogme movement, but that's not the most important thing: the basics of film-making - lighting, editing, composition, etc - are the same whatever format you shoot in.\" </p> <p>Afect has survived for the past 15 years on begged favours, appeals, discounts and donations from benefactors such as Sir John Gielgud, Bob Hoskins, Julie Christie and its patron, Mike Leigh. It is also the only facility in the country which caters to students with neither the time nor the money for full-time film school. On top of the cash crises, there are now uncertainties over the leasing of its property and without support from the newly established Film Council, it could disappear. </p> <p>\"We're the scavengers of the film world,\" says Chris Bullmore, a former film and commercials maker who joined Afect's slim staff last year. \"Everything's done on the cheap, but it's a bloody good exercise for the future. A lot of film-making is about discipline, and the less money you have, the more disciplined you are. It's the artist-in-garret syndrome.\" </p> <p>As befits a facility whose existence has been spartan at the best of times, the course is oriented firmly towards the practice of making films with limited resources - and essentially that means 16mm film only. For new film-makers, 16mm has considerable advantages over digital, Bullmore explains: \"It's much cheaper - especially when you want to hire edit suites and the like - and if something goes wrong with DV equipment, there's nothing you can do. It's all lost, and there's no way you can fix it yourself.\" </p> <p>In the Film Council's statement of aims and objectives, unveiled this April, \u00a31m of its \u00a354m expenditure was allocated to training and education. The council is due to begin dishing out its money soon, and Ross's fear is that, as the Film Council's literature states, the distribution of that \u00a31m will be co-ordinated through Skillset, an industry-backed national training body. \"You'd think, being the only part-time film school in the country, that our claim would be self-evident, but that remains to be seen,\" says Ross. \"Skillset is OK for certain skills and training, but there's a constant pretence that this is adequate to deal with film-making education generally. It isn't. It will provide some limited technical jobs in the industry but that's not what we're about. We're about making young film-makers. </p> <p>\"Film education has never been adequately supported in this country,\" he continues. \"Go to America and there's a place like this in every state. Or compare it to music-making facilities here. In Britain there are facilities for making quality music but virtually none for film.\" </p> <p>A sometime film-maker, sculptor and photographer, Ross founded Afect according to principles formed in his student days at the International Film School with Mike Leigh, among others. \"The philosophy was really that this is an incredibly potent medium, and why isn't it speaking to more people?\" he recalls. \"It was like the printing press when it came out - a way of disseminating information to the people in general, but with film, those wider possibilities were not being explored.\" </p> <p>There was much idealistic discussion about opening up film-making and creating alternative routes for film distribution and education, but Ross was one of the few who did something about it. He initiated a film course that was open to anybody, under the auspices of the Inner London Education Authority (Ilea). He started it as a practical course one evening a week in the City of London. The course grew fast and moved venues, but then Ilea was abolished - 15 years ago - just as the course was gathering momentum. Afect decided to continue the project without state support. </p> <p>With the exception of visiting tutors and lecturers, Ross ran the school virtually single-handed until last year. There are now four permanent staff members (by and large unpaid) and an average intake of 25 students a year. The two-year diploma course costs less than \u00a31,500 a year, compared with a minimum of \u00a33,900 a year at the National Film and Television School, or \u00a34,620 at the London International Film School. </p> <p>Crucially, teaching takes place in the evenings and at weekends. During the daytime, the studio is hired out in order to bring in extra revenue. Though Afect is not geared towards turning out professional film-makers, the school claims to have a respectable record when it comes to placing graduates within the industry. Katherine Freeman, for example, has had her short films broadcast as part of the BBC's 10x10 programme, and one, finished at Afect, has been purchased by Anglia Television. Mark Sturdy is another, a former banker whose films have been shown at the NFT and who is currently developing scripts commercially. </p> <p>In many ways, the state of film-making has not panned out the way Ross, Leigh and co hoped in the 70s. There is still no established network of local film-making or film education across the country, and the success or failure of the British film industry under the Film Council will be measured primarily in terms of financial performance rather than benefit to society. The only indication that \"taking film to the people\" is on the agenda at all is an undefined pledge to \"ensure that over time the British film industry reflects the rich cultural diversity of the UK, and offers equality of opportunity and access to individuals whatever their background\". </p> <p>Ross avoids separating the conflicting issues, however, arguing that there should be a net commercial gain from giving more people access to film-making. \"What is commercial?\" he asks. \"It's a question of how you market it. In an age where there's so much flimsy material around without any guts or heart, little films with personal conviction ought to be commercial. I would think the public is sick and tired of so-called 'commercial' material. For me, the subjectivity of each person - that is the most interesting thing, and I think the scope of our film culture is much too narrow.\" </p> <p>Afect has presented its case to the Film Council and is now waiting to see whether a life-saving cash injection follows or not.

      "bodyText": "Now that you need no more than a digital video camera and a good idea, it should be easier than ever to become a film-maker; but as any old hand will tell you, there's more to filming than point-and-shoot. \"There's a whole generation that knows nothing about film-making beyond pressing a button on a camcorder,\" says Jeremy Ross, founder and director of the Advancement of Film Education Charitable Trust (Afect). Afect sees itself as something of a model for film education in this country, although it teeters on the brink of extinction and its scrounged 16mm equipment could be seen as outdated by today's fledgling auteurs. A small, independent school in King's Cross, London, it has become an institution in Britain's film-making community, both for its uniquely populist stance and its sheer tenacity. If you want to know more without giving up your day job, Ross is one of very few people who can help. \"I don't know much about the Dogme movement, but that's not the most important thing: the basics of film-making - lighting, editing, composition, etc - are the same whatever format you shoot in.\" Afect has survived for the past 15 years on begged favours, appeals, discounts and donations from benefactors such as Sir John Gielgud, Bob Hoskins, Julie Christie and its patron, Mike Leigh. It is also the only facility in the country which caters to students with neither the time nor the money for full-time film school. On top of the cash crises, there are now uncertainties over the leasing of its property and without support from the newly established Film Council, it could disappear. \"We're the scavengers of the film world,\" says Chris Bullmore, a former film and commercials maker who joined Afect's slim staff last year. \"Everything's done on the cheap, but it's a bloody good exercise for the future. A lot of film-making is about discipline, and the less money you have, the more disciplined you are. It's the artist-in-garret syndrome.\" As befits a facility whose existence has been spartan at the best of times, the course is oriented firmly towards the practice of making films with limited resources - and essentially that means 16mm film only. For new film-makers, 16mm has considerable advantages over digital, Bullmore explains: \"It's much cheaper - especially when you want to hire edit suites and the like - and if something goes wrong with DV equipment, there's nothing you can do. It's all lost, and there's no way you can fix it yourself.\" In the Film Council's statement of aims and objectives, unveiled this April, \u00a31m of its \u00a354m expenditure was allocated to training and education. The council is due to begin dishing out its money soon, and Ross's fear is that, as the Film Council's literature states, the distribution of that \u00a31m will be co-ordinated through Skillset, an industry-backed national training body. \"You'd think, being the only part-time film school in the country, that our claim would be self-evident, but that remains to be seen,\" says Ross. \"Skillset is OK for certain skills and training, but there's a constant pretence that this is adequate to deal with film-making education generally. It isn't. It will provide some limited technical jobs in the industry but that's not what we're about. We're about making young film-makers. \"Film education has never been adequately supported in this country,\" he continues. \"Go to America and there's a place like this in every state. Or compare it to music-making facilities here. In Britain there are facilities for making quality music but virtually none for film.\" A sometime film-maker, sculptor and photographer, Ross founded Afect according to principles formed in his student days at the International Film School with Mike Leigh, among others. \"The philosophy was really that this is an incredibly potent medium, and why isn't it speaking to more people?\" he recalls. \"It was like the printing press when it came out - a way of disseminating information to the people in general, but with film, those wider possibilities were not being explored.\" There was much idealistic discussion about opening up film-making and creating alternative routes for film distribution and education, but Ross was one of the few who did something about it. He initiated a film course that was open to anybody, under the auspices of the Inner London Education Authority (Ilea). He started it as a practical course one evening a week in the City of London. The course grew fast and moved venues, but then Ilea was abolished - 15 years ago - just as the course was gathering momentum. Afect decided to continue the project without state support. With the exception of visiting tutors and lecturers, Ross ran the school virtually single-handed until last year. There are now four permanent staff members (by and large unpaid) and an average intake of 25 students a year. The two-year diploma course costs less than \u00a31,500 a year, compared with a minimum of \u00a33,900 a year at the National Film and Television School, or \u00a34,620 at the London International Film School. Crucially, teaching takes place in the evenings and at weekends. During the daytime, the studio is hired out in order to bring in extra revenue. Though Afect is not geared towards turning out professional film-makers, the school claims to have a respectable record when it comes to placing graduates within the industry. Katherine Freeman, for example, has had her short films broadcast as part of the BBC's 10x10 programme, and one, finished at Afect, has been purchased by Anglia Television. Mark Sturdy is another, a former banker whose films have been shown at the NFT and who is currently developing scripts commercially. In many ways, the state of film-making has not panned out the way Ross, Leigh and co hoped in the 70s. There is still no established network of local film-making or film education across the country, and the success or failure of the British film industry under the Film Council will be measured primarily in terms of financial performance rather than benefit to society. The only indication that \"taking film to the people\" is on the agenda at all is an undefined pledge to \"ensure that over time the British film industry reflects the rich cultural diversity of the UK, and offers equality of opportunity and access to individuals whatever their background\". Ross avoids separating the conflicting issues, however, arguing that there should be a net commercial gain from giving more people access to film-making. \"What is commercial?\" he asks. \"It's a question of how you market it. In an age where there's so much flimsy material around without any guts or heart, little films with personal conviction ought to be commercial. I would think the public is sick and tired of so-called 'commercial' material. For me, the subjectivity of each person - that is the most interesting thing, and I think the scope of our film culture is much too narrow.\" Afect has presented its case to the Film Council and is now waiting to see whether a life-saving cash injection follows or not. Plans for expansion and improvement are in place but on hold pending their decision and the uncertainty over the leasing of the property. Even if Afect fails to win support, Ross would not feel his project had been a failure, rather a prototype for small film-making facilities in this country, which he hopes will inspire imitators. \"My original idea - what foolishness one starts with - was that we could take it to different cities, or have a properly equipped van and take it to schools, teaching basic film-making. There's scope for that. So much could be done for so little.\" \u0095 Afect can be contacted on 020-7837 5473 or 0771 400 1200.",

      "body": "<p>Some nine years ago, trying to pass the time in a doctor's waiting room, my business partner was leafing through a dog-eared copy of Country Life. It contained an article commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of a man who called himself Grey Owl. The more she read of his extraordinary story, the more she became convinced that here was a terrific subject for a feature film. </p> <p>Later that same morning I found her in our office, trying to sell the idea. This Grey Owl, she explained, was a man with a cause, an essentially good man with something important to convey, who also happened to be a liar, a lush, a bigamist and one of the world's great impostors. She went on to say that he had been a very successful trapper in Canada, killing hundreds of animals for their pelts, until his love for a local woman, and her love for two orphaned baby beavers, brought about a kind of epiphany. From then on, he crusaded fiercely to save this species from near-extinction and to preserve the Canadian wilderness for posterity. </p> <p>Grey Owl, who was the most celebrated \"Red Indian\" of his day, had written a number of best-selling books and in the 30s he came to England to promote them, dressed as a chief in buckskins and a feathered war bonnet. He was invited to Buckingham Palace. He lectured up and down the country. It was then that it all came back to me. </p> <p>Over half a century earlier, my brother David and I had attended one of Grey Owl's lectures in Leicester, where we lived. We had even claimed afterwards to have shaken the hand of this real \"Redskin\" and we had asked him for his autograph. I recalled how we had fought for possession of the book containing the author's signature. I also remembered, with renewed chagrin, that it was Dave who won. </p> <p>Growing keener by the minute on the idea of this film - and knowing that my brother was back from one of his many journeys to hobnob with killer whales or wade through some disgusting pile of bat dung - I picked up the phone. Yes, Dave said, of course he still had the book. And no, he would not hand it over. Defeated yet again in the sibling stakes, I asked where, if anywhere, he thought Grey Owl stood in the canon of conservationists. </p> <p>The answer was immediate: \"He was a major figure, one of the first of his kind. But, sadly, his death in 1938, and the revelations that followed, plus the outbreak of war, meant that all his warnings were ignored. The great tragedy is that if people had acted on what he was saying, the whole ecological movement would have been advanced by at least 30 years.\" That sealed it. I became determined to make a film about this intriguing character and I eventually cast that wonderful actor Pierce Brosnan in the title role. </p> <p>But, back then, after I put the phone down, I went on thinking about the evening in 1936 when Dave and I went to Grey Owl's lecture in the De Montfort Hall. It had been a defining moment for both of us, an event which managed perfectly to combine the disparate passions which were to absorb us for the rest of our lives. Dave was 10 and I was 13. For as long as I could remember my brother had this strong affinity with the natural world. His room was always cluttered with snake casts, dead insects and the conglomeration of fossils he insisted on carrying back from our holidays in Wales. He was the quiet, studious one, Dave; the undisputed favourite son of my academic father. I was the noisy elder brother, the show-off with the bad school reports whose theatricality, to my father's disgust, was fostered by our mother, the enthusiastic president of the local amateur drama society. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Dave's memories of Grey Owl's lecture are very different to my own. He was bowled over by the man's determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave's own credo to this day. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, recall almost nothing of what Grey Owl said. The fascination for me lay in his showmanship, in his stage presence, which was phenomenal. The thrilling Indian head-dress, made of rare eagle feathers, made him nearly 8ft tall. His skin was a wonderful bronze colour (I now know he applied a vegetable dye in his dressing room), and, in the days when other races were rarely seen in England, I found him compellingly exotic. </p> <p>That January evening marked the start of a year which changed our family life for ever. Within months, the civil war in Spain would prompt my mother to march down Granby Street under a red banner in support of the Republicans. In reply, one of Franco's Leicester adherents would lob a brick through our drawing-room window. Undaunted, my mother formed and chaired a local committee to care for evacuated Basque children and, shortly thereafter, one of them caused me to fall in love for the very first time. Her name was Rosa. My father was chairing another local committee which was helping to bring Jewish refugees out of Germany. Again, children were the principal concern, and our house became a staging post for a series of scared youngsters on their way to relatives in the safety of North America. Two little girls, Irene and Helga, would eventually be stranded with us when it was no longer possible for passenger ships to sail the Atlantic. They became our much-loved unofficial adopted sisters and lived within our family until 1946. Both their parents perished in the Holocaust. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in April 1938, our celebrity lecturer died in far-off Canada. On the following day, a newspaper, aptly named The Worth Bay Nugget, broke the scoop it had courteously been sitting on while he remained alive. Grey Owl, it was revealed, had absolutely no \"Red Indian\" blood. His real name was Archibald Stansfield Belaney and, far from being nurtured by a Native American tribe, he had been born and brought up by two maiden aunts in Hastings. Soon the English papers ware full of the story of how the whole nation, including King George VI, his queen and the two little princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret Rose, had been duped by this magnificent impostor. </p> <p>But it was my mother, as usual, who cut to the heart of the matter. I can see her now, thwacking down the issue of the Manchester Guardian containing Grey Owl's revelatory obituary. \"His identity doesn't matter a damn,\" she, who never uttered an oath, said firmly. \"The only important thing is what he came to tell us.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Grey Owl is released next Friday.</p>",

For their mutual comfort as fellow sufferers - and also finding in their situation a kind of parodic and perversely exciting intimacy - they embark on an ambiguous affaire de coeur of their own. </p> <p>It is a secret liaison whose every glance and touch has a silent static crackle of tension: not sexual tension precisely, but the tension of two people who are consciously duplicating the form of their partners' adultery, with all the snatched restaurant meals and meetings in hotel rooms, but forgoing the sexual denouement and refusing to make the four-cornered puzzle snap into place. They have become siblings rather than lovers, a brother and sister orphaned by the absence of trust, and sustained by their own faint odour of incest. </p> <p>The man is Chow Mo-Wan, a local newspaper editor, played by the estimable Tony Leung, a performer who grows inexorably in depth and acuity. There is something desperately poignant in his gentle, sensitive face, at once lined and boyish. His neighbour is Su Li-Zhen, played by Maggie Cheung, a stunningly beautiful, statuesque screen presence, her hair always worn glamorously up, with discreet droplet earrings, and whose elegant, roof-raisingly sexy form the camera is wont to follow as she sashays along alleys and into corridors. </p> <p>It's the only overtly salacious thing about a film which effortlessly maintains its own code of formality and propriety. In a film dominated by interiors and cramped apartments, Cheung's face provides a landscape of emotions, showing the camera not merely its luminous beauty, but subtly graduated responses: the flinch at a nosy neighbour's intrusion, the sheen of sweat and unease, the slight puffiness that goes with misery, the ghost of a future middle age of regret. And throughout the film it is Chow and Li-Zhen that we see, but never their counterparts: an affectation, perhaps, but one of whose validity and naturalness Wong Kar-wai effortlessly persuades us. </p> <p>Hong Kong itself is here a dark and crowded place, steamy and noirish, whose vast sprawl and energy is hinted at in only a few modest sets and locations. It is a place where it seems always to be raining, and from which the two principals are perpetually forced to take good-humoured shelter. </p> <p>In the Mood for Love is a movie perfumed not merely by the noodles and dumplings that feature so prominently, but by the smell of clothes drying out after being caught in the rain. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle and William Chang, the production designer, have created an almost narcotically tactile world of textures and surfaces, lovingly noticed and brilliantly realised. It is a world of crumbling plaster, perspiring wallpaper, of tacky formica restaurant booths, shabby-genteel apartments framed in a shot which can be suddenly bisected by the tatty curtain, flapping in an urban breeze which mirrors the sirocco of suppressed longing. This is the dark and lonely \"mood\" for love that Wong Kar-wai evokes. </p> <p>But it is in this hothouse of emotions that Chow and Li-Zhen's friendship flowers, and Chow discovers in himself the talent that he has yearned for: with Li-Zhen as muse, he starts turning out martial-arts serials. It is a happy invention, as the feeling of pulp fiction, of melodrama and even hysteria beneath the decorum, saturates the film. Emboldened perhaps by this artistic relationship, the couple start to rehearse future, painful scenes together: Li-Zhen confronting her adulterous husband and their own inevitable parting. </p> <p>Wong Kar-wai locates the poignancy of their love affair in how short-lived it is, and how short all our lives are, and how we behave as if the excitement or the pain of each moment is the precursor to an infinite supply of such moments: the prelude to an open-ended vista, rather than one stage of a finite history. This is partly a humid, faintly Graham Greene-like love story, partly a conundrum about opaque and enigmatic behaviour. But what it mostly is, is a love story for grown-ups, a film that treats the themes of love and betrayal with almost theological seriousness. It is not to be missed.</p>",

In a film dominated by interiors and cramped apartments, Cheung's face provides a landscape of emotions, showing the camera not merely its luminous beauty, but subtly graduated responses: the flinch at a nosy neighbour's intrusion, the sheen of sweat and unease, the slight puffiness that goes with misery, the ghost of a future middle age of regret. And throughout the film it is Chow and Li-Zhen that we see, but never their counterparts: an affectation, perhaps, but one of whose validity and naturalness Wong Kar-wai effortlessly persuades us. Hong Kong itself is here a dark and crowded place, steamy and noirish, whose vast sprawl and energy is hinted at in only a few modest sets and locations. It is a place where it seems always to be raining, and from which the two principals are perpetually forced to take good-humoured shelter. In the Mood for Love is a movie perfumed not merely by the noodles and dumplings that feature so prominently, but by the smell of clothes drying out after being caught in the rain. Cinematographer Christopher Doyle and William Chang, the production designer, have created an almost narcotically tactile world of textures and surfaces, lovingly noticed and brilliantly realised. It is a world of crumbling plaster, perspiring wallpaper, of tacky formica restaurant booths, shabby-genteel apartments framed in a shot which can be suddenly bisected by the tatty curtain, flapping in an urban breeze which mirrors the sirocco of suppressed longing. This is the dark and lonely \"mood\" for love that Wong Kar-wai evokes. But it is in this hothouse of emotions that Chow and Li-Zhen's friendship flowers, and Chow discovers in himself the talent that he has yearned for: with Li-Zhen as muse, he starts turning out martial-arts serials. It is a happy invention, as the feeling of pulp fiction, of melodrama and even hysteria beneath the decorum, saturates the film. Emboldened perhaps by this artistic relationship, the couple start to rehearse future, painful scenes together: Li-Zhen confronting her adulterous husband and their own inevitable parting. Wong Kar-wai locates the poignancy of their love affair in how short-lived it is, and how short all our lives are, and how we behave as if the excitement or the pain of each moment is the precursor to an infinite supply of such moments: the prelude to an open-ended vista, rather than one stage of a finite history. This is partly a humid, faintly Graham Greene-like love story, partly a conundrum about opaque and enigmatic behaviour. But what it mostly is, is a love story for grown-ups, a film that treats the themes of love and betrayal with almost theological seriousness. It is not to be missed.",

A lot of the fun is in the casting: the world-weary Tim Allen has never been more likeable; Alan Rickman's innately superior manner and look of deep, withering distaste are put to wonderful use in his role as the series' Spock-like \"alien\", while the cinema's mighty alien-slayer Sigourney Weaver is cast as a blonde interstellar glamourpuss whose only function is to repeat the captain's orders to the computer. The script enables Rickman, whose dignity is constantly being undermined, to say \"I've played Richard the Third.

      "body": "<p>The government yesterday accepted that successive administrations' failures had contributed to the BSE catastrophe and apologised for the first time to families of those who had died from the horrific, incurable disease that transferred from cattle to humans.</p> <p>As politicians of all sides expressed their sorrow and regret for the \"dreadful, scarring experience\" endured by the 85 victims of variant CJD, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, announced that talks with families would begin next week on care and compensation packages that will run into millions of pounds.</p> <p>All measures to protect human health and the extent of scientific knowledge into the killer diseases that ravaged the farming industry and now threaten unknown numbers of the population are to be reviewed following the publication of the long-awaited report into the handling of Britain's most costly peacetime disaster.</p> <p>The findings and 167 recommendations of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, following a two-and-a-half year \u00a327m inquiry, represented an indictment of the Whitehall system under successive Tory governments but his 47 criticisms of 25 individuals were measured and low key. Conservatives last night were privately relieved at Lord Phillips' apparent reluctance to be harder hitting but it was in no one's political interest to say so.</p> <p>Lord Phillips said nothing could have prevented the BSE epidemic or the infection of consumers because the long, secret incubation periods of the diseases had taken hold before the first cattle were identified as suffering from a brand new killer.</p> <p>But after praising the efforts of all those trying to fight BSE, he said plaudits must remain muted because policy decisions too often took too long to make and were not implemented, enforced or monitored with sufficient rigour.</p> <p>Lack of communication, indecision, and the \"team failure\" to recognise the risk to human health from BSE were among the most serious shortcomings. The attempt to \"sedate\" the public with reassuring messages helped cause \"a public feeling of betrayal\" when the probable link to human health was announced in March 1996. One key flaw had been the government's failure to ban mechanically recovered meat from carcasses - used in hamburgers and pies - at the same time as other potentially risky parts of cattle in 1989. This was eventually done in 1995 after years of poor slaughterhouse controls.</p> <p>The reaction of families was muted but many accepted the Phillips' report was \"a thorough job\" rather than a whitewash.</p> <p>Labour ministers attempted, not always successfully, not to make political capital out of the findings, which only covered the BSE crisis until the human link was established, when John Major was still prime minister. Mr Milburn said he had said \"sorry to the families for the pain and suffering they have experienced. It is clearly for those who were in the position of power and responsibility at the time to make their own apologies\". He was making \u00a31m immediately available to provide better care for vCJD victims and their families while negotiations took place with them and their legal representatives.</p> <p>Government sources said it was up to families to decide whether they wanted to pursue legal action but suggested agreed compensation arrangements were better than drawn out and uncertain passage through the courts. A trust set up in 1987 to compensate people who were infected by HIV or Aids through blood transfusion had so far paid out \u00a393m to nearly 1,300 victims.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, said the Phillips report was being sent to all European partners in the hope they could avoid making similar mistakes to Britain's. A key finding is that BSE has been a \"particularly British disaster\", with over 170,000 cattle being diagnosed here and fewer than 1,500 abroad, most traceable to the exporting of live animals or infected animal feed.</p> <p>Earlier Mr Brown told the Commons that the inquiry team had not looked for villains or scapegoats. He insisted Labour had ended the \"deregulation culture\" of the previous Tory governments.</p> <p>Mr Major told the Commons that the inquiry report was \"impressive and objective\".

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday accepted that successive administrations' failures had contributed to the BSE catastrophe and apologised for the first time to families of those who had died from the horrific, incurable disease that transferred from cattle to humans. As politicians of all sides expressed their sorrow and regret for the \"dreadful, scarring experience\" endured by the 85 victims of variant CJD, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, announced that talks with families would begin next week on care and compensation packages that will run into millions of pounds. All measures to protect human health and the extent of scientific knowledge into the killer diseases that ravaged the farming industry and now threaten unknown numbers of the population are to be reviewed following the publication of the long-awaited report into the handling of Britain's most costly peacetime disaster. The findings and 167 recommendations of Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, following a two-and-a-half year \u00a327m inquiry, represented an indictment of the Whitehall system under successive Tory governments but his 47 criticisms of 25 individuals were measured and low key. Conservatives last night were privately relieved at Lord Phillips' apparent reluctance to be harder hitting but it was in no one's political interest to say so. Lord Phillips said nothing could have prevented the BSE epidemic or the infection of consumers because the long, secret incubation periods of the diseases had taken hold before the first cattle were identified as suffering from a brand new killer. But after praising the efforts of all those trying to fight BSE, he said plaudits must remain muted because policy decisions too often took too long to make and were not implemented, enforced or monitored with sufficient rigour. Lack of communication, indecision, and the \"team failure\" to recognise the risk to human health from BSE were among the most serious shortcomings. The attempt to \"sedate\" the public with reassuring messages helped cause \"a public feeling of betrayal\" when the probable link to human health was announced in March 1996. One key flaw had been the government's failure to ban mechanically recovered meat from carcasses - used in hamburgers and pies - at the same time as other potentially risky parts of cattle in 1989. This was eventually done in 1995 after years of poor slaughterhouse controls. The reaction of families was muted but many accepted the Phillips' report was \"a thorough job\" rather than a whitewash. Labour ministers attempted, not always successfully, not to make political capital out of the findings, which only covered the BSE crisis until the human link was established, when John Major was still prime minister. Mr Milburn said he had said \"sorry to the families for the pain and suffering they have experienced. It is clearly for those who were in the position of power and responsibility at the time to make their own apologies\". He was making \u00a31m immediately available to provide better care for vCJD victims and their families while negotiations took place with them and their legal representatives. Government sources said it was up to families to decide whether they wanted to pursue legal action but suggested agreed compensation arrangements were better than drawn out and uncertain passage through the courts. A trust set up in 1987 to compensate people who were infected by HIV or Aids through blood transfusion had so far paid out \u00a393m to nearly 1,300 victims. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, said the Phillips report was being sent to all European partners in the hope they could avoid making similar mistakes to Britain's. A key finding is that BSE has been a \"particularly British disaster\", with over 170,000 cattle being diagnosed here and fewer than 1,500 abroad, most traceable to the exporting of live animals or infected animal feed. Earlier Mr Brown told the Commons that the inquiry team had not looked for villains or scapegoats. He insisted Labour had ended the \"deregulation culture\" of the previous Tory governments. Mr Major told the Commons that the inquiry report was \"impressive and objective\". He added: \"All of us, as we read it, must accept our own responsibilities for shortcomings that were made and the problems that arose from them.\" BSE and its transition to vCJD had been a \"dreadful , scarring experience\". Tim Yeo, the Tory agriculture spokesman, said he was \"truly sorry for what has happened, and I apologise to the families who have suffered bereavement and for those people who are suffering a terrible illness.\" Findings of the report \u0095 BSE developed into a disaster because of intensive farming, and the feeding of cow and sheep remains to cows. \u0095 Delays, bureaucracy, lack of rigour by civil servants and poor enforcement undermined policy. \u0095 Reassurance over safety of beef was a mistake which undermined public confidence in government. \u0095 The government did not lie or cover up. \u0095 But it was preoccupied with preventing an alarmist overreaction because it believed the risk to humans was remote. \u0095 BSE-like diseases may yet emerge in other animals. Recommendations \u0095 Even when risk to humans seems remote, all reasonable precautions must be taken. \u0095 There should be more checks on possible pathways of transmission, and on occupational risks. \u0095 The government must be more open about risk to re-establish public trust. \u0095 Review of secrecy in licensing of medicines. \u0095 More responsibility must be established for coordinating research into new diseases. \u0095 Better training in experts who can track diseases. \u0095 More enforcement checks. \u0095 Scientific committees must not water down assessments of risk to avoid causing alarm. \u0095 Better contingency planning.",

      "bodyText": "Casting himself as a leader untainted by political cynicism or partisan hostility, George W Bush made his most personal attack so far on Al Gore yesterday, signalling a rough turn in the presidential election campaign as the two men battle for advantage in what the opinion polls say is going to be the closest White House contest for a generation. Speaking in Pittsburgh, he accused Mr Gore of being \"bitter and negative\", and depicted himself as the man who could set a new tone of \"civility and bipartisanship\" in Washington. As he did so, his taxation and spending plans - the centrepiece of his policy appeal - ran into one of the most influential challenges it has yet faced. \"Bush is very much overspending Gore,\" the senior pensions expert at the American Academy of Actuaries, Ron Gebhardtsbauer, said after a panel from the academy assessed both candidates' budget plans. But it was the attack on Mr Gore that captured the headlines rather than the possibility that Mr Bush might himself be indulging in the \"fuzzy maths\" with which he has taunted his Democratic opponent. \"My opponent's campaign is a fitting close to the Clinton-Gore years,\" Mr Bush said, as the majority of the national polls continued to show him narrowly ahead of Mr Gore. \"They're going out as they came in. Their guide, the nightly polls; their goal, the morning headlines; their legacy, the fruitless search for a legacy.\" Speaking confidently, to the frequent accompaniment of cheers from supporters, he accused Mr Gore of setting a confrontational tone. \"He talked about ripping the lungs out of political adversaries. Part of his campaign headquarters is called, incredibly enough, 'the slaughterhouse', and his staff proudly calls itself a band - and I quote - of 'killers'. \"That's political killers, of course.\" Meanwhile the non-partisan group of financial experts from the Academy of Actuaries was delivering its damaging judgment. Mr Bush's budget plans, the panel found, would force the US back into annual deficits after he leaves office. His published commitment to cut taxes and switch pension contributions into personal accounts would mean that the government could no longer meet its financial commitments without going into the red from around the year 2015. The actuaries calculated that Mr Bush's plans would make it all but impossible for the US to eliminate its national debt, a goal to which both main parties have officially subscribed ever since the current account of the federal budget moved into surplus two years ago. The Bush campaign team says its projections show that it can eliminate the federal debt by 2016. Mr Gore has promised to achieve this by 2012, a pledge which the actuaries say can be fulfilled, on the basis of their published figures. \"I don't see any way they [the Bush plans] pay off the public debt,\" Mr Gebhardtsbauer said. \"In 2015, the budget will go negative. There won't be a surplus any more.\" The actuaries said they were not taking sides in the election but applying standard evaluation techniques to the plans and rhetoric of the two campaigns. Mr Gebhardtsbauer said that the only way the Bush campaign could make good its claims would be by double-counting the equity building up in pension accounts. The actuaries, a professionally conservative group, also said that Mr Gore's budget plan was much more accurate and specific than Mr Bush's. The Bush team has so far produced only broad outlines of its intentions, Mr Gebhardtsbauer said. A statement from Mr Gore said: \"The numbers don't add up.\" Mr Bush was promising \"the same trillion dollars to two different groups of people\", he said.",

      "bodyText": "BSE emerged in cattle in south-west England as long ago as the 1970s, and had nothing to do with scrapie in sheep, the Phillips report concludes, finally debunking a cherished theory about the origin of the disease. The report endorses the theory that BSE and its human equivalent are caused by \"prions\" - rogue versions of molecules of a chemical that occurs naturally in all animals. On the scientific response to the growing crisis, civil servants are accused of recruiting expert advisers on the basis of scientists they happened to know, rather than the best people for the job. The Tory government is accused of failing to give its scientific advisers proper remits, asking scientists what to do instead of seeking advice on which to base decisions, and misrepresenting the scientific advice it was getting to the public. The first committee of scientists set up to advise the government, under the zoologist Sir Richard Southwood, is accused of being too ignorant of the realities of the meat trade to have made the recommendations it did about how the \"remote risk\" of BSE infecting humans could be reduced to a minimum. The scientists are also criticised for allowing themselves to be bullied by civil servants into removing from their early recommendations a mention of the dangers of BSE infecting medicines. The Phillips report's conclusion that BSE did not result from cattle being fed the remains of sheep with a related brain disease, scrapie, lays to rest a theory that led to serious delays in scientists' appreciation of the dangers to humans. Like BSE and its human equivalent, CJD, scrapie causes the fatal breakdown of brain tissue, with holes appearing in the brain, giving it a spongy appearance. Because scrapie had been known in sheep for hundreds of years, without any sign of it being passed to humans, scientists assumed the risk of BSE spreading to people was negligible. Cows had been eating fragments of dead sheep in the form of meat and bone meal (MBM) since the 1920s. In the early years of BSE scientists thought a change in the way MBM was recovered from carcasses had led to scrapie jumping the species barrier into cows, and that the 1980s BSE cases were the first.

      "body": "<p>The following is an edited extract of Lord Woolf's recommendations:</p> <p>This is my decision as to tariffs in the cases of Jon Venables and Robert Thompson. They were ordered to be detained during her majesty's pleasure, after being convicted of murder on November 24 1993. In reaching my decision I have had regard to all the information available to me, and in particular the following considerations:</p> <p>\u0095 The murder took place on February 12 1993. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were then 10 years of age, having been born, in the case of Jon Venables on August 13 1982 and in the case of Robert Thompson on August 23 1982.The facts of the murder were exceptionally horrific. They were summarised by the trial judge, Morland J. in the following terms when sentencing Jon Venables and Robert Thompson: \"The killing of James Bulger was an act of unparalleled evil and barbarity. This child of two was taken from his mother on a journey of over two miles and then was battered to death without mercy and then his body was placed across the railway line so that his body would be run over by a train in an attempt to conceal his murder. In my judgment your conduct was both cunning and very wicked.\"</p> <p>Subsequently, in the boys' absence, the judge added: \"How it came about that two mentally normal boys aged 10 of average intelligence committed this terrible crime is very hard to comprehend ...\"</p> <p>\u0095 The statements which I have received from James Bulger's parents make clear the effects of the murder on them. The mother was 26 at the time. She says, and I accept, \"not a day goes by without her thinking of the events of the February 12 1993\". Her marriage broke up in the summer of 1994 and she has since remarried. She, however, believes that if James had not been killed, she would in all probability still be married to James's father. Prior to the break-up of her first marriage, she had a further son and since her remarriage she has had two more sons. She is now naturally very concerned for the safety of these children and she says she will not allow them out of her sight.</p> <p>The impact of James's death has been similarly traumatic for Mr Bulger. I have been provided with a clinical psychological report relating to Mr Bulger. The psychologist was of the opinion that Mr Bulger was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the murder of his son for which he requires treatment. This has adversely affected his ability to obtain employment. Members of his family, his brother and mother, are seriously traumatised. They would, according to the report, also benefit from assessment and treatment.</p> <p>\u0095 Reports on the two boys show clearly that they have made striking progress in the secure units where they have been detained. For example, in a report of February this year a consultant adolescent forensic psychiatrist, accustomed to working with child murderers, says of Jon Venables: \"He has made exceptional progress as a child adolescent serving HMP with personal development, acknowledgement of the enormity of his offence, understanding of his actions as a child, and in his \"normal\" adolescent development in \"abnormal circumstances\".</p> <p>A similar report in the case of Robert Thompson, also written in February of this year, states: \"Robert has made exceptional progress in his current placement with regard to maturity, education and insight gained in therapy. Robert accepts responsibility for the grave acts he committed in the offence and shows great remorse for the pain and suffering he caused.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Jon Venables and Robert Thompson have been detained in separate secure units. They are different personalities with different backgrounds. However, the assessment of the respective psychiatrists and the staff of the units at which they are detained are very similar when they describe the way these two young men have responded to their punishment. Significantly, the assessments generally agree that both of these young men are genuinely extremely remorseful about the crime which they committed, and the effect which it must have had on James's family. In addition, neither has shown any aggression or propensity for violence during his detention. They have worked hard in pursuing their education and, given their circumstances, have considerable achievements to their credit. All those who have reported on them regard the risk of their reoffending as being low.</p> <p>\u0095 The progress which they have made does not mean that it is going to be easy for them to be rehabilitated into the community. They are bound to have been affected by having grown up in a secure institution. They have had limited contact with the outside world during the last seven years. It is therefore important that the programme necessary to prepare for their return to the community is commenced as soon as appropriate.</p> <p>\u0095 They are both now 18 years of age. Being 18 they would be due to be transferred to young offenders' institutions. The reports make clear that the transfer would be likely to undo much of the good work to which I have referred. Having been living in an unnaturally protected environment, they are unprepared for the very different circumstances in which they would be detained in a young offenders' institution. They are unlikely to be able to cope, at least at first, with the corrosive atmosphere with which they could be faced if transferred. There is also the danger of their being exposed to drugs.</p> <p>\u0095 Their release will not end their punishment. Having become responsible young men, they will have to live with, and will be marked by, what they did when children of 10. Their crime is not one which is expunged by the Rehabilitation Act 1974. They will be on licence and liable to be recalled to custody for the rest of their lives if they do not comply with the terms of their licence.</p> <p>\u0095 If I had been called on to set their tariff after they had been sentenced, I would probably have selected 10 years as being appropriate, as did Lord Taylor. Today it is clear, as was not clear then, that it is necessary when fixing the tariff to take into account the welfare of the children concerned. In addition, when reviewing a tariff in the case of children I am required to take into account the progress which they have made since they have been in detention. In the case of both these young men the information before me makes it clear that they have done all that is open to them to redeem themselves. While their crime remains horrendous, they are entitled to credit for this. Because of their behaviour they are entitled to a reduction in the tariff to eight years, which happens to be the figure determined by the trial judge.</p> <p>\u0095 An eight-year tariff would expire on February 21 2001. I have already pointed out that it would not be in their or the public's interest for these two young men to be transferred to a young offenders' institution. In all probability, if the tariff period expired today it is likely that it would be after February 2001 before the Parole Board could decide whether they should be released and, if so, for the necessary arrangements to be made to enable this to happen. I therefore set a tariff which will expire today. This will enable the very difficult task of deciding if and how these young men should return to society to begin. I emphasise that the final decision as to whether they should be released and conditions for relief are the responsibility of the board and nothing I have said is to interfere with the board's discretion.</p>",

Being 18 they would be due to be transferred to young offenders' institutions. The reports make clear that the transfer would be likely to undo much of the good work to which I have referred. Having been living in an unnaturally protected environment, they are unprepared for the very different circumstances in which they would be detained in a young offenders' institution. They are unlikely to be able to cope, at least at first, with the corrosive atmosphere with which they could be faced if transferred. There is also the danger of their being exposed to drugs. \u0095 Their release will not end their punishment. Having become responsible young men, they will have to live with, and will be marked by, what they did when children of 10. Their crime is not one which is expunged by the Rehabilitation Act 1974. They will be on licence and liable to be recalled to custody for the rest of their lives if they do not comply with the terms of their licence. \u0095 If I had been called on to set their tariff after they had been sentenced, I would probably have selected 10 years as being appropriate, as did Lord Taylor. Today it is clear, as was not clear then, that it is necessary when fixing the tariff to take into account the welfare of the children concerned. In addition, when reviewing a tariff in the case of children I am required to take into account the progress which they have made since they have been in detention. In the case of both these young men the information before me makes it clear that they have done all that is open to them to redeem themselves. While their crime remains horrendous, they are entitled to credit for this. Because of their behaviour they are entitled to a reduction in the tariff to eight years, which happens to be the figure determined by the trial judge. \u0095 An eight-year tariff would expire on February 21 2001. I have already pointed out that it would not be in their or the public's interest for these two young men to be transferred to a young offenders' institution. In all probability, if the tariff period expired today it is likely that it would be after February 2001 before the Parole Board could decide whether they should be released and, if so, for the necessary arrangements to be made to enable this to happen. I therefore set a tariff which will expire today. This will enable the very difficult task of deciding if and how these young men should return to society to begin. I emphasise that the final decision as to whether they should be released and conditions for relief are the responsibility of the board and nothing I have said is to interfere with the board's discretion.",

      "bodyText": "John Prescott yesterday put in place a national recovery plan for the railways to deal with the mounting problems caused by broken rails that are paralysing the network. The plan will be ready in two weeks, although it will be many months before the network is restored to normal. Railtrack has been given the onerous task of inspecting the poorly maintained rail system, whose deficiencies were exposed by the Hatfield crash. The announcement came after another derailment, this time at Virginia Water in Surrey, for which Railtrack blamed leaves on the line for having made the train, with 150 to 200 people on board, slide along the line after a trainee driver reported that he had lost control. Railtrack went on to paint a downbeat picture of the national situation. It warned that the delays could get worse, and estimated that speed restrictions could be imposed on more than 300 sites compared with 206 at present. Managers agreed that the final total could be even higher. Engineers have found 1,850 cracked rails, a problem which Railtrack has identified only within the past 12 months. As Railtrack promised to give at least 24 hours' notice of any further line closures, the deputy prime minister said: \"The public wants to be satisfied that the rail industry is working together and is doing everything possible to address the safety issues raised by the tragic accident at Hatfield.\" Mr Prescott said that the industry had a \"robust national track recovery plan\" to which Railtrack and the train operators were committed. It could be used to give passengers the best possible information about future disruption. He expected that it would take until Wednesday to inspect all the sites where there was known to be \"gauge corner cracking\" - the cause of the Hatfield crash. There would then be a meeting on Thursday to review progress on the national recovery plan. Mr Prescott paid tribute to the industry's frontline staff who had worked hard to deal with \"horrendous problems\" and continued to do so. He agreed that the patience of passengers had been stretched to the limit and would continue to be so. But the industry had to work together to have a well managed plan for finding faults and repairing them. Advanced notice would minimise disruption and maximise safety. Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, pointed out that the worst case scenario was that 300 sites would have temporary speed restrictions. He said that passengers would continue to face several days of disruption but that the worst should be over by next Wednesday when most inspections will be completed. Mr Corbett declared: \"Our teams on the ground are tired and tempers get frayed, but we have got to bash on and get it sorted. This is the biggest programme of track inspection ever seen.\" He said that Clapham junction in south London, one of the busiest places on the network, was earmarked for disruption this weekend as engineers prepared to replace rails. According to Mr Corbett, the network will be \"getting back to stability over the weekend\". By Tuesday, Railtrack would know where it was with speed restrictions. One of the serious passenger problems which the train companies will have to address is refunding passengers for not getting them to their destinations in time. Thousands of people travelling to work have been late, and the shadow strategic rail authority said yesterday that the matter would be dealt with sympathetically. Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the shadow authority, said the emergency summit had agreed on four steps: the identification of problem areas, which should be completed by next week; the development of emergency timetables across the network; the need to return to a normal programme of maintenance; and for the industry to re-examine its structure. Rail regulator Tom Winsor said he fully backed the steps.

He was worried there might be an unquantifiable risk to human health which prompted his rapid recommendation to set up the Southwood inquiry into the disease. </p> <p>In 1990, during a TV interview, he said there was \"no risk associated with eating British beef\". He told the inquiry nearly 10 years later: \"The use of such a phrase must have resulted from a slip of the tongue, of which I may well not have been aware at the time.\" Lord Phillips, in his report, accuses him of giving the public \"false reassurance\" about the safety of beef. </p> <p><b>Sir Kenneth Calman<br>Chief medical officer, England, 1991-98</b> </p> <p>He told the inquiry he had given public statements on the safety of beef on the basis that bans on risky offals entering human food and potentially infectious animal feed were effective. That changed in October 1995 when the then chief vet, Keith Meldrum, told him that checks on abattoirs had found spinal cords in some carcasses. </p> <p>The following month he told Douglas Hogg, minister of agriculture, he could no longer give assurances that banned offals were not entering food. He also revealed that in March 1996, days before the probable link between BSE and the human disease of variant CJD was announced, he had to warn the Ministry of Agriculture not to publish \"reassuring messages\". </p> <p>He is criticised in the report for issuing statements in 1993 and 1995 saying that it was safe to eat beef. </p> <p><b> Kenneth Clarke<br>Health secretary 1998-1990</b> </p> <p>The ebullient minister said he was aware \"of territorial rivalry between my medics and Maff\", but surprised the committee by suggesting his officials recommended the agriculture ministry should \"go it alone\" on announcing an offal ban in 1989. The health department was concerned that going beyond scientific advice would upset the \"distinguished\" Southwood committee. </p> <p>The report said Mr Clarke should have asked his health officials to consider why, if offal was not safe for babies, it was nevertheless safe for adults. He sometimes appeared frustrated at his treatment at the inquiry, and told the inquiry's counsel, Paul Walker: \"I am not convinced you have the faintest understanding of how decision making goes on in government.\" </p> <p><b> John Gummer<br>Agriculture minister of state 1985-88, minister of agriculture 1989-93</b> </p> <p>Famously fed his daughter Cordelia a hamburger in May 1990 to demonstrate the safety of beef.

He told the inquiry the \"almost universal advice\" was that the risk to humans was \"so remote as for all practical purposes to be ignored\". </p> <p>After taking advice from officials, he decided not to ban mechanically recovered meat used in cheap burgers. It was another five years before it was banned. </p> <p>The report praised Mr Gummer for introducing more openness into the Ministry of Agriculture, but the publicity stunt was questioned. </p> <p><b> Douglas Hogg<br>Agriculture minister 1995-97</b> </p> <p>His forlorn appearance topped by distinctive hat provided one of the BSE crisis's most enduring images as the government struggled to contain the damage after admitting a probable link between the cattle epidemic and the emergence of a deadly new human disease. </p> <p>The report says he did not act quickly enough when confronted with evidence of a link. He is criticised for not involving the Department of Health in discussions about how to deal with the crisis. </p> <p>In December 1995, he tried to get experts from the government's advisory committee on mad cow disease to back his statements in order to reassure the public about the safety of beef. The report says: \"With hindsight, we can see that it was not a desirable exercise.\" </p> <p><b> John MacGregor<br>Minister of agriculture 1987-89</b> </p> <p>He learned of the disease from officials in July 1987. He was cautious about a compulsory slaughter and compensation policy on BSE cases because of the cost. Instead he set up an expert working group under Prof Sir Richard Southwood to investigate the outbreak and possible human health risks. </p> <p>He was responsible in 1989 for the measure that hopefully has saved many human lives - banning high-risk beef offal from human foods. The cabinet had already agreed to ban offals from baby food but Mr MacGregor said he had felt \"the only utterly safe thing to do was ban the lot\". </p> <p>Although praised by Lord Phillips for introducing the ban, he is criticised for presenting it in a way that covered up the fact that experts were seriously worried about BSE-infected meat entering the food chain. </p> <p><b> Keith Meldrum<br>Chief vet 1988-1997</b> </p> <p>The man in charge of animal health for most of the BSE crisis. The report accuses him of not giving proper consideration to the theory that BSE could \"jump\" species and infect other animals or humans. </p> <p>He is accused of telling the then agriculture minister, John Gummer, that there was no link between a cat with a BSE-like illness and mad cow disease. </p> <p>During the inquiry he insisted the Ministry of Agriculture had \"attempted as far as we were able to keep the public, scientific community and international authorities informed about all aspects of BSE\". </p> <p>But he said later: \"I do not believe it was my responsibility to advise government on the safety of a particular food ...

Mr Howard and his colleagues saw Lord Woolf as the worst sort of woolly liberal with dangerous tendencies to appropriate for judges the decision making role that should belong to Parliament. He has described himself as \"liberal with a small l\", and was one of the first judges to support incorporation of the European convention on human rights into UK law. He will not be surprised to find opprobrium heaped on him for paving the way for Thompson's and Venables' early release, but will see it as a price worth paying to safeguard their chances of rehabilitation as useful citizens.",

Four carriages carrying 150 to 200 passengers on the 8.21am South West trains service from Weybridge in Surrey to Staines went through a red light and left the track 100 yards from Virginia Water station, narrowly missing a commuter train travelling to Waterloo from Reading. The incident occurred on the same stretch of track where a train travelling at 60mph collided last week with a bus stranded on a level crossing at Pooley Green near Egham, Surrey. The train, which was travelling at 40mph, should have stopped at a red light outside Virginia Water station but overshot to a set of points at a junction which had been set for the train bound for Waterloo. As the train swerved out of control, signals were changed from green to red to prevent other trains crossing its path. No one was seriously injured but two passengers were treated for shock in hospital. Railtrack said last night that early investigations suggest the incident was caused by leaves on the line. Michael Holden, Railtrack's southern zone director, said that leaves on the track were the equivalent of black ice on the roads. \"The prompt action of the driver and the signalman ensured there was no danger to other trains or passengers,\" he said. Passenger Michael Groves, 41, from Weybridge, Surrey, vowed never to use the railways again. \"One moment it was like any other morning, the next there was terror.

The summary states: \"Some months prior to the bombing of the Israeli embassy on July 26 1994 the security service and the special branch received information from an agent source that a terrorist organisation unconnected to the two appellants was seeking information about the location and defences of the embassy for a possible bombing attack.\" The first indication that MI5 had been warned was revealed by the former MI5 officer, David Shayler, charged under the Official Secrets Act in connection with unrelated disclosures. \"If it wasn't for Shayler, nothing would have been revealed,\" said Mr Mansfield. The summary concluded that \"related intelligence received after the bomb attack indicated that the terrorist organisation had not in fact carried out the bombing\". This was seized on by Julian Bevan QC, counsel for the crown prosecution service, who described it as a \"vital sentence\". However, Mr Mansfield insisted the report would have been crucial to the trial defence since it raised questions that could have been put to MI5 and police witnesses as well as the jury. MI5 told the jury there was an \"intelligence vacuum\" surrounding the bombing. The report had not been handed to the trial judge as a result of \"human error\", the court heard. A reference to the report in a separate MI6 file also was not handed the judge because of \"human error\". A cross reference to the report in another file was not disclosed because of its \"unusual physical position\". Mr Mansfield suggested to Lord Justice Rose, Mr Justice Hooper and Mr Justice Goldring that the files had been hidden deliberately - an \"astonishing and incredible failure of the duty of disclosure by those responsible\". Questions remained on Rida Mughrabi, alleged to be the third party behind the bombing, who disappeared, said Mr Mansfield; he referred to claims that the ambassador had spoken of warnings of terrorist threats to Israeli or Jewish property, and said Mossad, the Israeli secret service, could have been agents provocateurs. Lord Justice Rose said he would not order the disclosure of any more MI5 files. The appeal continues.",

Allegations of a cover up cannot be substantiated, but the report says it was not surprising that the public felt it had been deceived. A \"culture of secrecy\" was identified in the Ministry of Agriculture and there was a \"team failure\" among officials, who were concerned about the beef export trade, to evaluate food risks. But the report concludes that there is no foundation in the allegation that the ministry put the interests of farmers before consumers.</p> <p>Scientists generally come out of the report well. They are commended for the quick identification of BSE in 1986 and the \"prompt detection\" of the variant CJD in humans in 1996. Anyone hoping to find \"villains or scapegoats should go away disappointed\", Lord Phillips says and adds: \"Most of those responsible for responding to the challenge posed by BSE emerge with credit.\"</p> <p>The report finds that the BSE epidemic was \"a consequence of an intensive farming practice - the recycling of animal protein in ruminant feed. This practice, unchallenged over decades, proved a recipe for disaster\".</p> <p>The inevitability of the disaster was caused by a number of factors: BSE had an incubation period of five years; it tended to strike a single cow in a herd; it had clinical signs similar to those of a number of other diseases; it was impossible to diagnose before clinical signs appeared; and it was transmissible to humans with a much longer incubation period. By the time BSE was identified in 1986, as many as 50,000 cattle were likely to have been infected.</p> <p>\"At the heart of the BSE story lie questions of how to handle hazard - a known hazard to cattle and an unknown hazard to humans. The government took measures to address both hazards. They were sensible measures, but they were not always timely nor adequately implemented and enforced.\"</p> <p>The lack of rigour by officials in implementing policy decisions was partly because of the belief of many before 1996 that BSE was not a potential threat to human life. \"The possibility of a risk to humans was not communicated to the public or to those whose job it was to implement and enforce the precautionary measures.\" But the report says: \"The government did not lie to the public about BSE. It believed that the risks posed by BSE to humans were remote. The government was preoccupied with preventing an alarmist over-reaction to BSE because they believed that the risk was remote. It is now clear that this campaign of reassurance was a mistake.</p> <p>\"A recurring theme in the BSE story,\" Lord Phillips says, \"has been growing public suspicion and dissatisfaction that important information was not being shared and discussed openly so that people were denied proper choices in matters that deeply affected them and their families.\" Victims and the families have special needs which should be addressed. \"The unusual problems of the diagnosis, treatment and care of the early cases of vCJD meant that for some of the victims and their families the tragic horror of the disease was made the more difficult to bear by lack of appropriate treatment, assistance and support.\"</p> <p>The report says individual cattle were probably first infected by BSE in the 1970s. When the first cow death was investigated by the central veterinary laboratory (CVL) in 1985 the disease was not recognised because it was masked by other factors. After BSE was identified in November 1986, gathering of data in the following months was impeded by an embargo in the state veterinary service about making the disease public.</p> <p>By the end of 1987 the laboratory had concluded that the cause of BSE was the consumption of meat and bone meal made from animal carcases and incorporated in cattle feed. This right conclusion was reached \"with commendable speed\". But other provisional conclusions by John Wilesmith, head of the CVL epidemiology department, were wrong.</p> <p>The cause of the disease was not derived from sheep infected with conventional scrapie, the report says for the first time, but by the recycling in cattle feed of cattle remains infected with BSE itself. It possibly originated in a cow or other animal that developed the disease as a consequence of a gene mutation. But the report says that the true origin \"will probably never be known with certainty\".</p> <p>The assumption that looser regulation in the rendering process had caused the feed to become infectious - a view held to this day - was also invalid. \"Rendering methods have never been capable of completely inactivating\" the disease.</p> <p>Assessing the danger to people was made difficult because of the long incubation period. \"Maff officials appreciated from the outset the possibility that BSE might have implications for human health.\" But they failed to consult with the department of health, and the chief medical officer, Sir Donald Acheson, was only informed in March 1988 after the ministry of agriculture had advised ministers that infected animals should be destroyed.</p> <p>Sir Donald's advice to set up an expert working party under Sir Richard Southwood, professor of zoology at Oxford University, was of \"crucial importance in safeguarding human health\". The Southwood report concluded that \"it was most unlikely that BSE would have any implications for human health\". But Lord Phillips says that it did not, as it should have done, make clear the basis for its assessment of risk. \"It did comment that if the assessment was incorrect the implications would be extremely serious. This warning was lost from sight.\"</p> <p>Scientists' views began to change slightly in 1990 when it was revealed that a cat had been diagnosed with a \"scrapie-like\" spongiform encephalopathy, yet their concerns were not made public. Instead the messages given to the public, by officials and ministers, was that beef was safe and that BSE was not transmissible. This impression led to a feeling of betrayal when it was announced in March 1996 that people could catch the disease.</p> <p><b> Infection</b><br></p> <p>The first measure to prevent further infection - the banning of cattle remains in cattle feed in July 1988 - had a dramatic effect in reducing to a fraction the escalating rate of infection. But ignorance about the scale of infection and the amount of material needed to transmit the disease led to thousands of animals being infected after the ban. The feed trade was given a period of grace of five weeks to clear their stocks. \"Some members of the feed trade, being given an inch, felt free to take a yard and continued to clear stocks after the ban came into force.\"</p> <p>More serious was the failure to appreciate that tissue the size of a peppercorn could transmit the disease. Cross-contamination in feedmills led to thousands more cattle being infected. The situation was made worse in 1990 by a ban on certain bovine offal for feed given to pigs and poultry, which was \"unenforceable and widely disregarded\". The dangers of cross-contamination were not realised until 1994.</p> <p>The decision to protect humans by the compulsory slaughter and destruction of animals with BSE was based on \"commendable advice\" from the Southwood working party but the report says it should have been introduced months earlier than August 1988.</p> <p>However, Southwood is criticised for failing to make plain that there was a risk of transmission in eating animals incubating the disease but not showing signs. It only warned about including ruminant offal and thymus in baby food. Both Maff and the health department missed this shortcoming. It was not until June 1989 that offal was banned in all human food.</p> <p>Maff officials also failed to give weight to concerns about the mechanical recovery of scraps left attached to the vertebral column for use in human food. Because of a breakdown in communications officials believed that the experts on the new spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (SEAC) were not concerned about the odd scrap getting through the system and some members on SEAC falsely believed that the spinal cord could be removed in its entirety. This was not remedied until 1995 when the meat hygene service took over enforcement of the regulations.</p> <p>Another failure was the lack of liaison between the ministry of agriculture and health officials about the dangers of the disease being carried in human medicines. A small number of vaccines were eventually phased out after consideration by the medicines control agency and the veterinary medicines directorate but these organisations \"do not appear to have been systematically accountable to anyone\". Some human vaccine stocks with bovine content were used until 1992. The report says that no comprehensive consideration was given to other pathways for infection until March 1996.</p> <p>Lord Phillips praises the prompt detection of vCJD by the CJD surveillance unit in that month. On March 16 SEAC concluded that the likely cause was BSE. However, he says that that conclusion should have become apparent to officials by early February. \"There was no interdepartmental discussion or consideration of policy option within either department until the middle of March 1996. This was an inadequate response.\"</p> <p>On the lessons to be learned Lord Phillips says the effective control of animal diseases needs a proper surveillance regime and incentives for farmers to report instances to the state veterinary service. Consideration should be given to creating a formal structure within government, embracing both animal and human health officials, to respond to future threats.</p> <p>Veterinarians should be trained in epidemiology: Mr Wilesmith of the CVL was the only member of staff with a postgraduate degree in the subject.</p> <p><b> Alarm</b><br></p> <p>Advisory committees like the Southwood committee \"should not water down its assessment of risk out of anxiety not to cause public alarm\". Government departments should retain in-house scientific expertise to review their advice.</p> <p>Rigorous thought must be given to the introduction of precautionary measures and make sure they are enforceable and watertight. This did not happen with the ban on bovine offal, meat and bone meal and mechanically recovered meat.</p> <p>Officials should draw up contingency plans and not just rely on advice from advisory committees. Those civil servants who attended two meetings of the SEAC in January and February 1996, when it became clear that vCJD would probably be linked to BSE, failed to put senior colleagues on alert.</p> <p>The lesson from the emergence of vCJD is that precautionary measures should be strictly enforced even if the risk is considered remote. All pathways by which vCJD may be transmitted between humans must be identified. Because bovine material is used in a range of food and non-food purposes, including cosmetics and medicines, a comprehensive review of infection should be undertaken.</p> <p>The report says no one has demonstrated a link between working on a farm and vCJD. The four farmers with BSE herds who did contract CJD were aged between 54 and 64 and their disease did not have the signs of the new variant.</p> <p>Lord Phillips makes much of the need for transparency from government. \"Our experience has led us to the firm conclusion that a policy of openness is the correct approach. When responding to public or media demand for advice, the government must resist the temptation of attempting to appear to have all the answers in a situation of uncertainty.</p> <p>\"We believe that food scares and vaccine scares thrive on a belief that the government is withholding information. If doubts are openly expressed and publicly explored, the public are capable of responding rationally and are more likely to accept reassurance and advice if and when it comes.\"</p> <p>At the end of volume 1 of the 16 volume report Lord Phillips names those people who face criticism.</p> <p>But he says: \"We draw attention to the fact that the areas where we have criticised individuals are relatively few. If those criticised were misguided, they were nonetheless acting in accordance with what they conceived to be the proper performance of their duties\".</p>",

Lord Phillips praises the prompt detection of vCJD by the CJD surveillance unit in that month. On March 16 SEAC concluded that the likely cause was BSE. However, he says that that conclusion should have become apparent to officials by early February. \"There was no interdepartmental discussion or consideration of policy option within either department until the middle of March 1996. This was an inadequate response.\" On the lessons to be learned Lord Phillips says the effective control of animal diseases needs a proper surveillance regime and incentives for farmers to report instances to the state veterinary service. Consideration should be given to creating a formal structure within government, embracing both animal and human health officials, to respond to future threats. Veterinarians should be trained in epidemiology: Mr Wilesmith of the CVL was the only member of staff with a postgraduate degree in the subject. Alarm Advisory committees like the Southwood committee \"should not water down its assessment of risk out of anxiety not to cause public alarm\". Government departments should retain in-house scientific expertise to review their advice. Rigorous thought must be given to the introduction of precautionary measures and make sure they are enforceable and watertight. This did not happen with the ban on bovine offal, meat and bone meal and mechanically recovered meat. Officials should draw up contingency plans and not just rely on advice from advisory committees. Those civil servants who attended two meetings of the SEAC in January and February 1996, when it became clear that vCJD would probably be linked to BSE, failed to put senior colleagues on alert. The lesson from the emergence of vCJD is that precautionary measures should be strictly enforced even if the risk is considered remote. All pathways by which vCJD may be transmitted between humans must be identified. Because bovine material is used in a range of food and non-food purposes, including cosmetics and medicines, a comprehensive review of infection should be undertaken. The report says no one has demonstrated a link between working on a farm and vCJD. The four farmers with BSE herds who did contract CJD were aged between 54 and 64 and their disease did not have the signs of the new variant. Lord Phillips makes much of the need for transparency from government. \"Our experience has led us to the firm conclusion that a policy of openness is the correct approach. When responding to public or media demand for advice, the government must resist the temptation of attempting to appear to have all the answers in a situation of uncertainty. \"We believe that food scares and vaccine scares thrive on a belief that the government is withholding information. If doubts are openly expressed and publicly explored, the public are capable of responding rationally and are more likely to accept reassurance and advice if and when it comes.\" At the end of volume 1 of the 16 volume report Lord Phillips names those people who face criticism. But he says: \"We draw attention to the fact that the areas where we have criticised individuals are relatively few. If those criticised were misguided, they were nonetheless acting in accordance with what they conceived to be the proper performance of their duties\".",

      "bodyText": "The day the BSE crisis broke is deeply ingrained in Mike Palmer's memory. As Stephen Dorrell rose in the Commons to deliver his bombshell announcement, 12 bullocks from the family's south Devon farm were on their way to be slaughtered. The Commons statement had hardly sunk in when the abattoir they were destined for had contacted the lorry driver by mobile phone to tell him not to bother completing the journey. The bullocks were returned live to the farm gate. Sitting in the kitchen of their rented home at Frogwell farm, Mr Palmer, 60, and his wife, Jeanette, wince as they recall the events of March 1996 and contemplate the slump in fortunes that has left them facing the prospect of having to work on well beyond retirement age for little or no reward. The Dorrell statement was devastating financially and emotionally. The Palmers had seen the ravages of BSE in cattle at first hand - 14 cases among their dairy herd dating back to 1988 - but they were \"absolutely horrified\" to hear of the possible effects on human health. In business terms, says Mr Palmer, pointing to figures from the most recent farm accounts, what Dorrell said caused chaos. \"In the ensuing weeks we couldn't sell anything and things have not been the same since. Prices have plummeted and they have stayed down.\" The Palmers are tenant dairy farmers, running an 80 strong herd of Friesians on 87 acres of farmland owned by Devon county council at Diptford, near Totnes. In partnership with their 32 year old son, David, they farm a further 160 acres at Halwell, three miles away, where they keep a herd of 220 beef cattle. Boreston farm, acquired 10 years ago when conditions in the industry were healthier, is, they say grimly, owned by the family and by Barclays bank. In the year to March 1996 - before the industry was plunged into BSE induced depression - the two farms made a combined profit of almost \u00a320,000. Three years later that had sunk to just \u00a37,666. With bank charges rising, and beef and milk prices remaining well below 1996 levels, accounts for the year to the end of March 2000 will show a further decline. The financial slump has forced the Palmers to cut back on outside labour and put investment in machinery on hold as they struggle to meet mortgage payments on the farm at Halwell and pay day to day bills. On a personal level it has meant they have been unable to take a proper holiday. More worryingly it means they will almost certainly be unable to retire when Mr Palmer turns 65 as they had planned. Like other tenant farmers their capital is largely tied up in the value of their herd. While house prices have been rising the value of the Palmers' dairy cattle has crashed from around \u00a364,000 in 1996 to around \u00a332,000 today. Leaving Frogwell farm in such circumstances is not an option. \"Normally farmers in our position would be able to raise enough money to buy a house on their retirement by selling off their livestock and their farm machinery. But since BSE I very much doubt that is going to be possible,\" says Mr Palmer, who is also chairman of the Devon NFU tenant farmers committee. He is, he is quick to point out, not alone in his predicament. \"Many tenant farmers have used their capital to survive and have had to increase their bank overdrafts. \"I know many people who are really worried about the future, some of them farmers who should be retiring this year. \"Some of the younger farmers have been getting out because it is easier for them to find a job elsewhere and I know many tenants who milk morning and evening and do an outside job in between just to survive. \"One just lives in hope that things will turn around.

      "body": "<p>Peter and Susan Hodge began to fear the worst as they watched their daughter Alison suffer increasing problems walking, her leg shaking, her balance faltering.</p> <p>They had seen the television pictures of cows staggering from BSE. \"I think I had realised what it was before she even went into hospital. I was not surprised when the doctor told us,\" says Susan.</p> <p>In their neat semi in Macclesfield, Cheshire, the Hodges chronicle how Alison displayed other classic symptoms of the human disease linked to eating infected beef - mood swings, aggression, slurred speech, hallucinations, problems swallowing and a gradual inexorable loss of bodily control.</p> <p>She died in August 1998 at the age of 25, in the bedroom where she had spent much of her youth, the 28th fatality in Britain from variant CJD.</p> <p>Alison had come home after a short stay in hospital. Her parents, her husband Richard Thorpe, his mother and his aunt watched her desperately cling on to life as they devised a rota to care for her. Peter talks movingly of having to help his adult daughter to the lavatory, clean her or wash her hair and somehow cope with the horrifying aversion to water, an element she had once adored, swimming whenever possible.</p> <p>\"She would just fight us. We woke up in the middle of the night when Richard had taken her to the bathroom and she was punching him in the face. It took three of us to calm her down and get her back into bed.\"</p> <p>Within three months, Alison was dead. Richard and her parents had taken the agonising decision not to do anything that would prolong her life. Mr Hodge remembers how a few days before she died, he tried to feed her with some cereal on a spoon. \"Suddenly, she stopped swallowing. Fortunately, I had a little syringe so I was able to get a little water and rinsed her mouth out. When Sue came home that night, we tried again. But that was the end of it. She just did not eat any more and drink any more.\" A couple of days later, she was given sedatives and on August 27 she died.</p> <p>It was all so different a couple of years earlier. Richard, a joiner, and Alison, who worked for a chain of toiletry stores, married in October 1995. After a childhood and early adulthood in which Alison suffered eczma, asthma, food allergies, migraines and other illnesses, life seemed good. She loved aerobics, working out and skiing. But Alison began getting anxious and Richard noticed she had less time for him. She was losing weight despite eating well and became scared by local youths burning out cars on the waste land behind their new house on the outskirts of an estate. The house was sold and the couple moved in with Alison's parents late in 1997.</p> <p>Alison's driving became erratic. She was tired and irritable but blamed stress. She persuaded Richard they should go skiing in Italy despite complaining of uncontrollable leg shaking. She fell and suffered a hairline fracture of her right elbow. On her return, she could hardly walk off the plane. One day she collapsed at work. Richard brought her home and she never went back. \"She could not even slice bread to make a sandwich,\" Susan recalls.</p> <p>By late May, she was in Manchester Royal Infirmary for tests. She was given a walking frame with wheels. She kept falling over. She was told a brain scan was of poor quality because she could not keep still. \"She was upset because she was unable to control her movements,\" says Susan.</p> <p>In June, Alison was back home after a consultant neurologist and experts at the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh disagnosed her as a suspect vCJD victim. The Hodges praise the help of their GP, district nurses and a members of local care attendant scheme. But lack of help from the local social services, was, says the family, \"appalling\".</p> <p>Cheshire social services department this week said it was concerned that the Hodges felt their response \"was less than satisfactory\" but pointed out that Alison's was the first case they had ever dealt with. Susan Hodge later helped officers to understand the needs of those caring for later victims.</p> <p>The local coroner refused an inquest because Alison died of \"natural causes\" - although the government has now agreed to open one early next month.</p> <p>The Hodges believe the government and health authorities must give families more support - financial, emotional and practical. Susan, who works in the coffee shop at a local supermarket, Peter, a coach driver, and Richard reduced their working hours and bought expensive equipment to care for Alison.</p> <p>\"I was left very much in the dark as to the benefits to which I was entitled,\" says Susan. \"We still had our household commitments, our mortgage and so on.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, they constantly rake over the past to try to understand why their daughter got the disease. During Alison's early years, they lived in the south-west where BSE was later to become a particular problem. They have often visited Leicestershire, where there has been an apparent cluster of victims. They regularly had roast beef for Sunday lunch, even though Susan gave it up when she sympathised with protesters against live cattle exports, but Alison would rarely eat beefburgers, cheap mince or meat pies.</p> <p>\"I think it is a blow to my pride really,\" admits Susan, who like other mothers of vCJD patients feels guilty that they may have fed their children contaminated material.</p> <p>She has also wondered about baby food (though Alison rarely ate it), gelatin of bovine origin around the antibiotic capsules Alison used to take and the appendix operation Alison had in her teens. Experts recognise the possibility that the disease can be spread by contaminated surgical instruments.</p> <p>Peter now says: \"I can never eat beef again. Some people know what Alison died of and say \"they do a nice roast beef down here\" and I want to punch them on the nose.\" Others seem almost embarrassed to hear of their daughter's story. \"When farmers come on television and say how hard done by they are, the first thing I say is 'tough titty'. I have no sympathy for them.\"</p> <p><b>CJD facts</b></p> <p><b>Deaths</b> 80.</p> <p><b>Victims still alive</b> 5.</p> <p><b>First known death</b> Stephen Churchill, aged 19, May 1995.</p> <p><b>Youngest death</b> 15.</p> <p><b>Oldest death</b> 54.</p> <p><b>Youngest victim</b> Girl of 14 still alive.

      "bodyText": "Peter and Susan Hodge began to fear the worst as they watched their daughter Alison suffer increasing problems walking, her leg shaking, her balance faltering. They had seen the television pictures of cows staggering from BSE. \"I think I had realised what it was before she even went into hospital. I was not surprised when the doctor told us,\" says Susan. In their neat semi in Macclesfield, Cheshire, the Hodges chronicle how Alison displayed other classic symptoms of the human disease linked to eating infected beef - mood swings, aggression, slurred speech, hallucinations, problems swallowing and a gradual inexorable loss of bodily control. She died in August 1998 at the age of 25, in the bedroom where she had spent much of her youth, the 28th fatality in Britain from variant CJD. Alison had come home after a short stay in hospital. Her parents, her husband Richard Thorpe, his mother and his aunt watched her desperately cling on to life as they devised a rota to care for her. Peter talks movingly of having to help his adult daughter to the lavatory, clean her or wash her hair and somehow cope with the horrifying aversion to water, an element she had once adored, swimming whenever possible. \"She would just fight us. We woke up in the middle of the night when Richard had taken her to the bathroom and she was punching him in the face. It took three of us to calm her down and get her back into bed.\" Within three months, Alison was dead. Richard and her parents had taken the agonising decision not to do anything that would prolong her life. Mr Hodge remembers how a few days before she died, he tried to feed her with some cereal on a spoon. \"Suddenly, she stopped swallowing. Fortunately, I had a little syringe so I was able to get a little water and rinsed her mouth out. When Sue came home that night, we tried again. But that was the end of it. She just did not eat any more and drink any more.\" A couple of days later, she was given sedatives and on August 27 she died. It was all so different a couple of years earlier. Richard, a joiner, and Alison, who worked for a chain of toiletry stores, married in October 1995. After a childhood and early adulthood in which Alison suffered eczma, asthma, food allergies, migraines and other illnesses, life seemed good. She loved aerobics, working out and skiing. But Alison began getting anxious and Richard noticed she had less time for him. She was losing weight despite eating well and became scared by local youths burning out cars on the waste land behind their new house on the outskirts of an estate. The house was sold and the couple moved in with Alison's parents late in 1997. Alison's driving became erratic. She was tired and irritable but blamed stress. She persuaded Richard they should go skiing in Italy despite complaining of uncontrollable leg shaking. She fell and suffered a hairline fracture of her right elbow. On her return, she could hardly walk off the plane. One day she collapsed at work. Richard brought her home and she never went back. \"She could not even slice bread to make a sandwich,\" Susan recalls. By late May, she was in Manchester Royal Infirmary for tests. She was given a walking frame with wheels. She kept falling over. She was told a brain scan was of poor quality because she could not keep still. \"She was upset because she was unable to control her movements,\" says Susan. In June, Alison was back home after a consultant neurologist and experts at the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh disagnosed her as a suspect vCJD victim. The Hodges praise the help of their GP, district nurses and a members of local care attendant scheme. But lack of help from the local social services, was, says the family, \"appalling\". Cheshire social services department this week said it was concerned that the Hodges felt their response \"was less than satisfactory\" but pointed out that Alison's was the first case they had ever dealt with. Susan Hodge later helped officers to understand the needs of those caring for later victims. The local coroner refused an inquest because Alison died of \"natural causes\" - although the government has now agreed to open one early next month. The Hodges believe the government and health authorities must give families more support - financial, emotional and practical. Susan, who works in the coffee shop at a local supermarket, Peter, a coach driver, and Richard reduced their working hours and bought expensive equipment to care for Alison. \"I was left very much in the dark as to the benefits to which I was entitled,\" says Susan. \"We still had our household commitments, our mortgage and so on.\" Meanwhile, they constantly rake over the past to try to understand why their daughter got the disease. During Alison's early years, they lived in the south-west where BSE was later to become a particular problem. They have often visited Leicestershire, where there has been an apparent cluster of victims. They regularly had roast beef for Sunday lunch, even though Susan gave it up when she sympathised with protesters against live cattle exports, but Alison would rarely eat beefburgers, cheap mince or meat pies. \"I think it is a blow to my pride really,\" admits Susan, who like other mothers of vCJD patients feels guilty that they may have fed their children contaminated material. She has also wondered about baby food (though Alison rarely ate it), gelatin of bovine origin around the antibiotic capsules Alison used to take and the appendix operation Alison had in her teens. Experts recognise the possibility that the disease can be spread by contaminated surgical instruments. Peter now says: \"I can never eat beef again. Some people know what Alison died of and say \"they do a nice roast beef down here\" and I want to punch them on the nose.\" Others seem almost embarrassed to hear of their daughter's story. \"When farmers come on television and say how hard done by they are, the first thing I say is 'tough titty'. I have no sympathy for them.\" CJD facts Deaths 80. Victims still alive 5. First known death Stephen Churchill, aged 19, May 1995. Youngest death 15. Oldest death 54.

GartnerConsulting said that the value of the European internet sector will soar from $53bn (\u00a337bn) to $1.3 trillion in the next four years, with old economy rather than dot.com companies responsible for the bulk of the upturn. </p> <p>The report, commissioned by networking company Cisco, claimed that up to 95% of dot.coms were expected to fail within two to five years. For most, the costs of setting up a website and distribution system and establishing their brand were crippling. </p> <p>However, the growth of European e-commerce was not expected to result in a significant increase in overall sales. Nick Smith, vice-president of GartnerConsulting, said: \"People are not going to want more lawnmowers just because of the internet.\" </p> <p>The Gartner report shows that more money is being spent in Europe on internet infrastructure and applications than on online deals. But while infrastructure spending would grow slowly, the value of e-commerce would soar 123% a year over the next four years. </p> <p>Over the same period, average transaction values per head of population would jump from $500 to $12,000 in the US from about $300 to $8,000 in the UK, and from $240 to $7,000 for the European Union members as a whole. </p> <p>\u0095 Patrica Hewitt, the e-commerce minister, yesterday said the auction of 42 licences to deliver broadband internet and multimedia services over the airwaves will start on November 10.

The move came on the day that a study showed that established firms would dominate the internet economy. GartnerConsulting said that the value of the European internet sector will soar from $53bn (\u00a337bn) to $1.3 trillion in the next four years, with old economy rather than dot.com companies responsible for the bulk of the upturn. The report, commissioned by networking company Cisco, claimed that up to 95% of dot.coms were expected to fail within two to five years. For most, the costs of setting up a website and distribution system and establishing their brand were crippling. However, the growth of European e-commerce was not expected to result in a significant increase in overall sales. Nick Smith, vice-president of GartnerConsulting, said: \"People are not going to want more lawnmowers just because of the internet.\" The Gartner report shows that more money is being spent in Europe on internet infrastructure and applications than on online deals. But while infrastructure spending would grow slowly, the value of e-commerce would soar 123% a year over the next four years. Over the same period, average transaction values per head of population would jump from $500 to $12,000 in the US from about $300 to $8,000 in the UK, and from $240 to $7,000 for the European Union members as a whole. \u0095 Patrica Hewitt, the e-commerce minister, yesterday said the auction of 42 licences to deliver broadband internet and multimedia services over the airwaves will start on November 10. The government is expecting to raise a minimum of \u00a378.3m from the auction.",

At a meeting in D\u00fcsseldorf of interior ministers from the 16 regional governments, and a later meeting of state governors in the eastern city of Schwerin, all but two of the states voted to outlaw the National-Democratic Party of Germany (NPD). The outcome makes it a virtually foregone conclusion that the government will petition the constitutional court to ban the NPD. In an increasingly tense atmosphere, a senior NPD official in the south-west, Siegfried St\u00f6ssgen, was recovering yesterday from three gunshot wounds received in an attack on Wednesday. The police would not rule out a political motive. The federal interior minister, Otto Schily, said an application to ban the NPD would send a \"clear signal\" to the neo-Nazis. \"A country that had gas chambers for the annihilation of millions of Jews cannot tolerate organised anti-semitism,\" he said. The proposed ban is the centrepiece of a government drive against the far-right. It decided to seize the initiative after concluding that racism, particularly in the east, could hinder future economic prosperity and social stability - largely because ministers feel that the country will need millions more immigrants. There is a deep cross-party reluctance to do anything that would curb the scope of German democracy, however. The conservative-led Hesse and Saarland states opposed the ban, saying that driving the NPD underground would not solve the problem. Guido Westerwelle, secretary-general of the Free Democrat party, said pursuing the ban would only \"build a stage for their hollow ideology\". A ban would allow officials to confiscate the NPD's property and withdraw federal campaign funds. Although electorally insignificant, the NPD, formed in 1964, received more than DM1.1m (\u00a3325,000) last year.",

The ruling came at the end of a five-year legal battle costing \u00a3840,000 between a divorced couple who farmed together for 33 years, building up assets worth \u00a34.6m when the case first went to court in 1996.</p> <p>Pamela and Martin White worked two farms near Taunton, Somerset. Mr White held one farm, Rexton, worth \u00a31.78m in his sole name.

      "bodyText": "Wives of rich husbands will get more money on divorce after a judgment yesterday by five law lords which acknowledges that the family courts have failed to keep pace with the times. The judges laid down guidelines that could see wives in \"big money\" divorce cases successfully laying claim to half the family's joint assets. Dozens of court cases have been adjourned pending the law lords' judgment. The ruling came at the end of a five-year legal battle costing \u00a3840,000 between a divorced couple who farmed together for 33 years, building up assets worth \u00a34.6m when the case first went to court in 1996. Pamela and Martin White worked two farms near Taunton, Somerset. Mr White held one farm, Rexton, worth \u00a31.78m in his sole name. Between them they owned the other farm, Blagroves, worth \u00a32.66m, and Mrs White had capital worth \u00a3193,000. The high court judge, Mr Justice Holman, gave her an \u00a3800,000 lump sum to add to her capital and ordered her to hand over her share of Blagroves farm to Mr White. The judge said the sum of nearly \u00a31m was enough to buy a house and provide for her living expenses, dismissing her claim that she should have enough to buy her own farm as unreasonable, since it would break up the farming business. Outraged, Mrs White, 64, took her claim to the court of appeal, where she won \u00a31.5m to add to her \u00a3193,000 capital - totalling around two-fifths of the joint assets. The legal costs for both sides had reached \u00a3310,000 by that stage. But both sides appealed to the House of Lords, incurring what Lord Nicholls described as an appalling \u00a3530,000 in legal costs, making a grand total of \u00a3840,000. Mr White, 63, argued that Mr Justice Holman was right just to give his former wife enough to live on for life and to buy a house. Mrs White argued that she should get half the assets. But despite the \u00a3530,000 legal bill, the House of Lords left her with exactly what the court of appeal had given her. The ruling means that judges in future cases where a couple's assets exceed their housing and income needs will start with a \"yardstick of equality\" instead of looking just at the wife's \"reasonable requirements\". Lord Nicholls, whose decision was endorsed by the four other law lords, said a wife would not automatically get half the assets because there were other factors to take into account. But \"as a general guide, equality should be departed from only if, and to the extent that, there is good reason for doing so\". He said the principle would not apply only in cases such as the Whites', where husband and wife had contributed equally to the family income. \"There should be no bias in favour of the money-earner and against the homemaker and the child-carer.\" Mrs White's solicitor, Ian Airey, said his client, now farming with friends in the west country, was disappointed that the House of Lords had not awarded her one of the two farms. \"While she appreciates that this case is of great importance to all divorcing couples and that many cases have been adjourned to await the judgment in this case, her principal concern has been to obtain a fair division of the matrimonial assets.\"",

The Department for Education and Employment had been planning an advisory code of practice on discrimination for this autumn. It has been drawn up by the equal opportunities commission, in cooperation with the Confederation of British Industry and gay rights groups, and sent to ministers for publication. However, an EU directive agreed last week will require the government to introduce laws within three years banning discrimination against gays. Stonewall, the gay rights campaign group, accepted yesterday that ministers were now likely to shelve the code and wait for the new legislation. There have also been doubts about whether the code as drafted would be detailed enough to have much impact in the workplace. Ministers are thought to favour waiting for the tough legislation required by the EU rather than fighting anti-gay rights groups first over a code and then over new laws.

The David Glass Ensemble, from London, had been working with 43 children from the indigenous Malay and Dayak groups and migrant Madurese on a British Council project in Pontianak in West Kalimantan, the Indonesian half of Borneo. Last night its five members and their two British Council coordinators were preparing to leave the strife-torn city for the capital, Jakarta, as buildings continued to blaze near their hotel and gangs rampaged on the streets. \"There is no way we can continue working here,\" Jim Hollington of the British Council said. \"Not only is the safety and security of the team at risk, but the project is no longer viable, because the children's parents will not let them take part in the workshops and performances.\" Jane Arnfield, the company's project leader, said the violence had taken them all by surprise. \"We have been here since last week and no one had any inkling that something like this might happen.\" Most of the children they were teaching were victims of violence between the Madurese and local tribes, particularly the Malays and Dayaks. Hundreds died in a major outbreak in the province last year, and 4,000 Madurese refugees from the unrest are still living in squalid camps in Pontianak, which lies on the equator, 470 miles north-east of Jakarta. The latest trouble began with a minor traffic accident on Wednesday morning. Violence quickly flared after a Madurese bus driver hit a Malay motorcyclist, even though no one was seriously injured. Police officers, said by witnesses to be extremely trigger happy, were unable to stop gangs of Malay youths rampaging through the city.

The stock plummeted almost 30% from 482.5p to end the session at 342.5p. </p> <p>Telecommunications stocks were also out of favour with <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless</strong> suffering a 6% fall to 897p and <strong>British Telecom</strong> not far behind as it slipped 16.5p to 737.5p in the wake of this week's advances. </p> <p>But it was not all bad news.

Hopes of a bounce in New York failed to materialise as the markets closed, with the main index dragged a further 65.5 points lower to 6,302.3. The Techmark 100 index of technology companies fared worse, sliding 101.9 points to 3,355.78. Logica was down 154p at \u00a318.66, Sema shed a further 70p to 910p and Misys ended the session 48p lower at 709p. They were not alone. Baltimore Technologies, the Irish internet security outfit, announced it was teaming up with Motorola, the US communications company, to develop secure solutions for mobile phones and other wireless devices. But even Baltimore, which has outperformed the UK software sector by about 40% this year, saw its shares initially gain 4% before sliding back 24p to 527p. AEA Technology, the science and engineering firm, had a dire day after issuing a profits warning due to a delay in the award of contracts. The stock plummeted almost 30% from 482.5p to end the session at 342.5p. Telecommunications stocks were also out of favour with Cable &amp; Wireless suffering a 6% fall to 897p and British Telecom not far behind as it slipped 16.5p to 737.5p in the wake of this week's advances. But it was not all bad news. The pharmaceuticals sector, at least, had something to cheer as it contributed 14 points to the FTSE's haul for the day. Shire Pharmaceuticals, replacing Woolwich following the acquisition of the mortgage bank by Barclays, celebrated its arrival in the FTSE 100 with its shares rising 35p to \u00a313.85. Glaxo Wellcome was 42p higher at \u00a320.44, while SmithKline Beecham rose 19.5p at 931.5p. AstraZeneca, the Anglo-Swedish drugs group, which announced it was outsourcing its IT infrastructure services to IBM, climbed 46p to \u00a332.16. Most retailers were also looking healthy with Sainsbury adding 11.5p to 382.5p, Tesco inching up 5.75p to 262.75p and Safeway putting on 5.25p to 285.75p. There was, however, little joy for beleaguered Marks &amp; Spencer which lost a further 8p, representing just over 4%, to 175p. The media sector was besieged with worries over advertising and ITV revenues which impacted strongly on the fortunes of Granada Media, which dropped 28p to 368p, and Carlton Communications, which lost 36p, or 6.3%, at 534p. BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, bucked the sector trend to enjoy a buoyant time with its stock up 23p to 885p. Banks had a generally poor day with Barclays going down 24p at \u00a318.80, HSBC slipping 15p to 968p and Lloyds TSB losing 3p to close at 657p. Elsewhere, shares in Churchill China, the British ceramic products maker, rose 11p to 157.5p after the company said trading was exceeding expectations. The improvement, it said, came from progress in its \"Dining In\" division where sales in north America were higher than last year. Imperial Chemical Industries was another gainer, up 15p at 412p on the strength of positive comment from its broker UBS Warburg. Away from the turmoil of the main FTSE 100 index, life was fairly tranquil with the FTSE Midcap 250, which crawled 5.3 points higher to end at 6,549.7.",

You, however, despite spending \"happy days\" with your family, have chosen to remain sad and bitter inside - so choosing another path. This is obviously causing you and those trying to get close to you a lot of distress. Perhaps sharing a few lessons that I learned from my saddest experiences might help: I learned to live in the present only, to choose to smile and be happy and positive, no matter what, and, most importantly, that you get out what you put out.

I am a man in a similar position to your friend and am waiting and hoping to get a positive response from a woman I feel very strongly about and with whom I have a good relationship. However, whilst there are encouraging signs, nothing has developed yet. This situation has been going on for some considerable time and is hard for me to conceal. For us men it is a difficult card to play as we are always at risk of accusations of harassment if we are seen to be too persistent for too long.

      "body": "<p>It was the late 60s in the Black Country. I was a small boy, and my brother Neil was even smaller. We sat at Nanny Lewis's dining table one afternoon each week having lunch. After lamb chops with peas and potatoes, two custard tarts in tinfoil cups would be brought out. We ate them, then I turned one foil cup upside down, looked at Neil, and said \"Flobadopalop?\" He looked at me and replied \"Flobadopalop!\" </p> <p>It was 1.40pm, and time for the weekly ritual of Bill and Ben, The Flowerpot Men. Neil and I watched the programme while my mother and her mother did the dishes in the adjoining kitchen. Even though Bill and Ben appeared as part of the Watch With Mother strand, we often watched without mother. </p> <p>And that was very appropriate. Just as Bill and Ben only came to life when the Gardener left the potting shed and went for lunch, so Neil and I only played when the authority figures were out of the room. </p> <p>Bill and Ben would make their appearance each week by rising over huge flowerpots in which, we supposed, they had been hiding while the Gardener pottered nearby. First, up popped Bill. Or maybe it was Ben (they were very nearly identical). Then down he popped. And then up. And then down. Neil and I and the rest of the children in the TV audience would join in, immediately caught up in playing hide and seek with The Flowerpot Men. </p> <p>But that primal game was tainted for me, since - even though Bill and Ben were playing at hiding from the friendly TV audience - I knew that this was just the simulation of the real hide and seek they played with the Gardener. But why did they need to hide? Why did they have Weed as a look-out while they played? Why did each episode end with them scrambling back into their pots as the Gardener returned filled with chops and tarts?

      "bodyText": "It was the late 60s in the Black Country. I was a small boy, and my brother Neil was even smaller. We sat at Nanny Lewis's dining table one afternoon each week having lunch. After lamb chops with peas and potatoes, two custard tarts in tinfoil cups would be brought out. We ate them, then I turned one foil cup upside down, looked at Neil, and said \"Flobadopalop?\" He looked at me and replied \"Flobadopalop!\" It was 1.40pm, and time for the weekly ritual of Bill and Ben, The Flowerpot Men. Neil and I watched the programme while my mother and her mother did the dishes in the adjoining kitchen. Even though Bill and Ben appeared as part of the Watch With Mother strand, we often watched without mother. And that was very appropriate. Just as Bill and Ben only came to life when the Gardener left the potting shed and went for lunch, so Neil and I only played when the authority figures were out of the room. Bill and Ben would make their appearance each week by rising over huge flowerpots in which, we supposed, they had been hiding while the Gardener pottered nearby. First, up popped Bill. Or maybe it was Ben (they were very nearly identical). Then down he popped. And then up. And then down. Neil and I and the rest of the children in the TV audience would join in, immediately caught up in playing hide and seek with The Flowerpot Men. But that primal game was tainted for me, since - even though Bill and Ben were playing at hiding from the friendly TV audience - I knew that this was just the simulation of the real hide and seek they played with the Gardener. But why did they need to hide? Why did they have Weed as a look-out while they played? Why did each episode end with them scrambling back into their pots as the Gardener returned filled with chops and tarts? What would the Gardener do if he found these little boys who were mostly made from flowerpots? I felt sure he would have crushed their faces with his hobnail boots, reduced their blank, painted eyes to blanker dust. He would have snapped off their arms and legs and used their flowerpot torsos for planting geraniums. Childhood innocence quickly became a fraught affair when we watched Bill and Ben. Games and playing were not things that would be tolerated by thunder-browed adults like the Gardener, and so Bill and Ben had to pretend not to exist rather than be caught playing in pots.

It's a sad reminder that most of what transpires on TV is made up, and that, no, you couldn't visit The Bayside Diner in Summer Bay if you went to Australia - because it isn't real. It's irksome enough that it's Christmas in ER when it's August here, but at least it always looks Christmassy in Chicago. That it's Christmas here and nearly Easter in Neighbours and Christmas in Neighbours when it's June here - and Christmas at a different time altogether in Home and Away - is really frustrating. In the future, when technological advances in TV mean you can watch anything that's ever been on at any time, it will be possible to watch Christmas special after Christmas special whenever you fancy. Not only will this advance the postmodernist theory about the end of history, it will cheer Wizzard, who wished it could be Christmas every day. </p> <p>They don't have Christmas in space, at least not on Star Trek: Voyager. There, they have Prixin instead, which sounds rude but isn't. </p> <p>All of which leads, like roads to Rome, to <strong> Buffy The Vampire Slayer</strong> (BBC2). Through no sound judgement on the part of BBC schedulers who have punted Buffy around like a beachball, it reached a Halloween episode just as the real world reaches Halloween. Spooky, but in a good way. Not one of the series' best episodes, its message was too obvious - the only thing to fear is fear itself (that, and Peter Stringfellow) - and its climax a bit of an anti-climax (again, like Peter Stringfellow). There were nice moments, however, especially a forlorn Buffy musing on the life of a pumpkin. \"You grow up in the sun, entwined with others but then someone comes along, cuts you open and scoops out your guts.\" Bless. </p> <p>And bless Kay Mellor too for <strong> Fat Friends</strong> (ITV) and its wonderful James Bond titles pastiche with cakes instead of guns. In the world of Julia Fleshman's slimmers, guts and growing up in the sun were also to the fore with Poor Lauren (Jewish Judy Mallett) having an epiphany (and it wasn't even January 6) about her unhappy life since she started dieting, Kelly failing to lose weight with only four weeks to go before her wedding, and Julia's hair looking more like a sedated guinea pig with each passing week. Its overstated moral notwithstanding (\"I blame the magazines\"), it's witty, moving and sparkly, much like Lauren in her tooth-fairy costume. </p> <p> <strong> Horizon: The Lost World </strong> (BBC2) started melodramatically. \"Earth has one secret left,\" it proclaimed. Really? Just one? Not a couple? Not 'What's in the middle of the Amazon?', 'What's at the very bottom of the ocean?' and 'Where do broken hearts go?' And then the one Horizon picked to examine? Talk about building your part up. </p> <p>Anyway, this small over-egging aside, the secret Horizon had picked was a good 'un - Lake Vostok buried under four kilometres of ice in the middle of Antarctica. It could be 30 million years old and hold the secrets of the origin of life on earth. Whoooo. The best kind of science'n' nature documentary, Horizon charted the existence of Vostok in men and women's minds from the depths of the Cold War when the Russians were boring holes in the ice above it, eating pounds of butter to keep warm (more effective than vodka, apparently) and weren't even convinced it existed, through to the British airborne radar team who confirmed its existence in the 1970s (\"It's half the size of Wales!\") to the present day and Nasa's involvement in the project. </p> <p>While the story of the lake is in itself a gripping yarn, the scientists involved in the programme seemed a bit thick. Speculating about the fate of the life with which Vostok once teemed, they took an awful long time to get to the idea that, in the dark and under the enormous pressure, all the plants and animals died, leaving only teeny tiny microbes. And wondering what see-through insects in a Romanian cave fed off, no one suggested unwitting scientists. </p> <p>But the most icky bit of Horizon was learning that microbes were the magicians of survival.

But analysts said the threats against Mr Smith and other whites would not stand up in court because of amnesties granted to both sides after the 1979 political settlement which ended the seven year liberation war. The offensive against whites has not succeeded in taking the heat off Mr Mugabe, who is facing an investigation by a parliamentary impeachment committee. An opinion poll found yesterday that 74% of Zimbabweans want him to step down. Numerous black Zimbabweans rejected his latest move. \"It's sheer madness and shows that Mugabe is trying to grasp at anything to prop up his dictatorial regime,\" said Wilfred Mhanda, a former liberation war fighter. \"He tried using the land issue but that did not work, so now he is playing his last card - the racist card.

      "bodyText": "SEC launches Amazon inquiry The US Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an \"informal\" investigation into accounting practices at Amazon.com, the internet bookseller, according to a report last night on the Wall Street Journal's website. The commission is asking questions about the way in which the company has valued shares from partner companies, often received in return for advertising on its home page. Some equity deals have been with private enterprises which have no public share price. A spokesman for Amazon.com was reported to have described the inquiry as \"normal\" and insisted that the firm had stuck to \"generally accepted accounting practices\". US debt relief deal comes in Britain welcomed news yesterday that Bill Clinton has won backing from Congress to pay America's $435m (\u00a3303m) contribution towards global debt relief efforts. Failure by the US to stump up its share of the costs threatened to endanger the flagship plan to relieve the debts of the poorest countries. \"I am relieved and delighted that Congress has at last recognised that debt relief for the poorest countries is essential to tackling poverty,\" said Clare Short, the international development secretary. \"I hope this means Congress will give increasing support to other international development efforts.\" Oil predicted at $10 a barrel The price of oil could crash to $10 a barrel by the end of 2001, former Saudi Arabian oil minister Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani is expected to announce next week. The price of crude oil has soared in recent weeks amid rising tension in the Middle East and fears about disruption to supplies, breaking the $35 a barrel level. Yesterday Brent crude oil for delivery in December was trading at around \u00a332.10 a barrel. Yorkshire Bank fined \u00a3100,000 Yorkshire Bank has been fined \u00a3100,000 by the investment management regulatory organisation for breach of regulatory rules relating to its PEP. Imro also demanded costs of \u00a355,000. The breaches, which took place between December 1996 and June 1999, concern the bank's failure to complete customer asset reconciliations, failure to keep records and failures in internal organisation and control, Imro said. MP confirms aid for Nissan Britain will give Nissan state aid to make its new Micra model in north-east England if the EC gives permission for the help, a minister said yesterday. Parliamentary undersecretary Alan Johnson said the government had offered Nissan aid in an effort to secure the Micra project for Sunderland, but that it was subject to EC approval. He did not say how much had been offered.",

      "bodyText": "The simmering conflict at MG Rover burst into the open yesterday when two of the car group's supervisory board directors resigned. Non-executive directors Brian Parker and Terry Whitmore have left the board of Techtronics, the company which acts as a supervisory board for the Midlands car maker. The two men, together with David Bowes, a member of the MG Rover executive board, have been at the centre of speculation about a rift in the company. The resignations came only hours before a full board meeting at which at least three of the four non-executive directors had been expected to voice criticism of John Towers, the former Rover chief executive, who heads the new company. Mr Towers led the Phoenix consortium which bought the car company from BMW for a nominal \u00a310 earlier this year. There had also been reports that supporters of Mr Towers would seek the resignation of the rebel non-executives. An industry insider described yesterday's resignations as \"a coup d'etat by the quiet Mr Towers\". An MG Rover spokeswoman said that Mr Parker, a West Midlands financier, and Mr Whitmore, a director of the Mayflower engineering group, had quit because of the \"rumours and speculation\" which had been circulating about them. She said they were busy men who had other calls on their time and added that they were both still committed to MG Rover. Neither man would be paid compensation and there were no immediate plans to replace them, she said. She pointed out that David Bowes, the managing director of Lola, the racing car firm which is making an MG car for the next Le Mans endurance race, was staying on, even though he had been reported to be planning a rival car making venture with Mayflower. Mr Towers is reported to have angered some of the non-executive directors by keeping them in the dark about his plans for an alliance with another car manufacturer. MG Rover is thought to need a partnership with a big car company that could provide it with a platform for some of its planned new models. Industry sources said that a link with Proton, the Malaysian car firm, was the most likely, even though Proton has said that it is not interested in any equity deal with MG Rover. Executive directors of MG Rover said last week that the group was discussing possible partnerships in a variety of areas. They added that they had recently been approached by another car maker, but refused to name the company. Tony Woodley, the T&amp;G union's chief motor industry negotiator, said: \"The business plan for MG Rover, drawn up by Mr Towers and his team, is robust and in place. \"The resignations, for whatever reason, will make absolutely no difference. So for the plant, the workers and the unions it is business as usual.\" MG Rover is seeking to make about 200,000 cars a year at its Longbridge plant, including the Rover 25, 45 and 75. It has been losing market share in the UK in recent months, but officials claim that sales are ahead of internal targets. The company is planning to introduce a range of \"sporty saloon\" cars under the MG badge, and to build a new MG sports car on the base of the new Le Mans car.",

The Swiss take these matters seriously. Banking comprises 15% of Swiss output and employs 200,000. One third of the global private banking market is estimated to be in the control of the Swiss.

In 1986, the Philippines sought the return of about $660m hoarded by former president Marcos in Swiss accounts - an inquiry which led to the introduction of money laundering laws. </p> <p>Banks were eventually forced to waive secrecy for the first time in the search for Holocaust assets. They now acknowledge that their early handling of the affair, culminating in a $1.3bn out of court settlement led by Cr\u00e9dit Suisse and UBS in New York this year, was callous. </p> <p>Since April 1998, banks in Switzerland have been compelled to check the identity of account holders and beneficiaries. Any suspicious transactions or assets must be reported to the authorities and blocked without notifying the account holder. </p> <p>They are also required to freeze accounts when magistrates ask them to do so in criminal cases, international legal assistance, and a civil proceedings such as those related to divorce, inheritance or bankruptcy. Investigating magistrates have access to details of account transactions under a freezing order.

All six staff of the federal police's two-year-old money laundering authority have resigned in recent months because they feel stifled. </p> <p>Recent events have not helped. Swiss magistrates froze about $620m of Nigerian assets allegedly embezzled by the late dictator Sani Abacha last year at the Nigerian government's request. After a separate inquiry, the federal banking commission sanctioned or reprimanded 12 banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Suisse and six Swiss subsidiaries of foreign banks, for handling the money despite self-regulation in the 1990s. </p> <p><strong>Naming and shaming cost</strong><br> </p> <p>\"The naming and shaming used for the first time adds to the cost of acquiring such clients\", Niklaus Blattner, head of the Swiss Bankers' Association, admits. </p> <p>It also highlighted the global nature of money laundering in the era of swift wire transfers and free-flowing capital. Several hundred million dollars flowed between Britain, the US and Switzerland, according to the banking commission. Lawyers acting on behalf of the Nigerian government and a Swiss magistrate have a paper trail that stretches from Brazil to Japan. </p> <p>\"Abacha will be a good learning case for all banks. It's a bit like Three Mile Island - we escaped a major catastrophe and we have to learn from it\", Mark Pieth says. </p> <p>Switzerland's next challenge is EU pressure to get rid of the last bastion of banking secrecy - tax evasion. Mr Villiger is suggesting that his solution, a 35% withholding tax on savings and foreign dividends instead of systematic surveillance, is better and might be considered by EU members themselves. It would also preserve the secrecy law. </p> <p>Yet ask the finance ministry or a Swiss bank how much secrecy is worth, and they cannot put a figure on it. Mr Blattner says: \"I'm sure that with competition increasing, quality and price are important, innovation is certainly influential, but let's say that secrecy is diminishing.\"</p>",

Swiss magistrates froze about $620m of Nigerian assets allegedly embezzled by the late dictator Sani Abacha last year at the Nigerian government's request. After a separate inquiry, the federal banking commission sanctioned or reprimanded 12 banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Suisse and six Swiss subsidiaries of foreign banks, for handling the money despite self-regulation in the 1990s. Naming and shaming cost \"The naming and shaming used for the first time adds to the cost of acquiring such clients\", Niklaus Blattner, head of the Swiss Bankers' Association, admits. It also highlighted the global nature of money laundering in the era of swift wire transfers and free-flowing capital. Several hundred million dollars flowed between Britain, the US and Switzerland, according to the banking commission. Lawyers acting on behalf of the Nigerian government and a Swiss magistrate have a paper trail that stretches from Brazil to Japan. \"Abacha will be a good learning case for all banks. It's a bit like Three Mile Island - we escaped a major catastrophe and we have to learn from it\", Mark Pieth says. Switzerland's next challenge is EU pressure to get rid of the last bastion of banking secrecy - tax evasion. Mr Villiger is suggesting that his solution, a 35% withholding tax on savings and foreign dividends instead of systematic surveillance, is better and might be considered by EU members themselves. It would also preserve the secrecy law. Yet ask the finance ministry or a Swiss bank how much secrecy is worth, and they cannot put a figure on it. Mr Blattner says: \"I'm sure that with competition increasing, quality and price are important, innovation is certainly influential, but let's say that secrecy is diminishing.\"",

Further attempts will now focus on the ninth compartment, where most of the 23 men are thought to have died. Officials did not say whether Kolesnikov's note described in detail how the Kursk went down. The government has yet to give an official explanation for the disaster, although senior naval officials continue to favour the theory that the accident was caused by a collision with a foreign submarine, rather than by a second world war mine or by an internal malfunction resulting in the blast. But the limited information which was released proved in itself extremely controversial, highlighting new contradictions in the officials' earlier statements. Earlier this month the deputy prime minister and head of the commission investigating the disaster Ilya Klebanov said the initial investigations had indicated that the almost all the sailors would have died before the vessel hit the bottom of the Barents Sea. Kolesnikov's testimony gives new credence to the navy's original reports that sailors could be heard knocking \"SOS. Water\" distress signals for three days after the disaster. In the aftermath of the crisis, officials said they had been mistaken and that the noises were probably just rumblings of collapsing machinery and water flooding into the hull.

      "bodyText": "A decision which makes the release of the two boys responsible for the horrific killing of James Bulger more likely was bound to attract the vilification of the still grieving Bulger family and any others who have been in the position of losing a loved in similar circumstances. The horror of this particular crime seems to have been increased by the fact that the killers themselves were so young and no more than babies in many people's eyes. And so it must be right that decisions to do with the punishment of these two boys, raising as they do extremes of public emotion, are being taken not by a politician but by a judge, who is capable of taking into account the welfare of the boys as well as the views of the Bulger family. The lord chief justice yesterday made a characteristically humane decision in the case of the two boys who killed James Bulger, when he decided that the term they must serve for punishment - in other words for deterrence and retribution, known as the \"tariff\" is eight years and has now expired. The tariff was previously fixed by the home secretary, and this decision was referred to the court by Jack Straw, the present home secretary, following a ruling of the European court of human rights in Strasbourg that it was a violation of the boys' human rights for the home secretary to intervene in the sentencing process. These two boys could soon be released and are, in the lord chief justice's view, ready to begin the difficult process of rehabilitation in the wider world. But apparently no matter how much time passes, when one remembers again the facts of the crime, the horror remains undimmed. In announcing his decision in open court, Lord Woolf remembered the \"horrendous\" nature of the crime but emphasised that the \"one overriding mitigating feature of the offence is the age of the two boys when the crime was committed. However grave their crime, the fact remains that if that crime had been committed a few months earlier, when they were under 10, the boys could not have been tried or punished by the courts\". He had also consulted relatives of James Bulger and considered expert evidence which indicated that the boys \"have made striking progress in the secure units where they have been detained...The reports draw a vivid picture of two boys who have significantly improved over the years...Significantly, the assessments generally agree that both of these young men are genuinely extremely remorseful about the crime which they committed and the effect which it must have had on James's family. In addition, neither has shown any aggression or propensity for violence during his period of detention.\" The law lords have recognised that there must be a different approach when considering the punishment of a child-offender distinct from that to be applied to an adult. In particular it was stated that any policy which \"ignored at any stage the child's development and progress while in custody as a factor relevant to his eventual release date is an unlawful policy\". There is a requirement to keep the protection and welfare of a child under review throughout the period he is in custody. This must surely be the right approach and it is the one which Lord Woolf has adopted. There can be no case for detaining these boys indefinitely and if as is said they have made significant progress and improvement then the time has come to move the process on. The final decision regarding release rests with the parole board, who will hear more evidence on the issue of dangerousness and determine a plan for release which will necessarily involve close supervision, monitoring and support. Lord Woolf's decision is not binding on the parole board and his decision is only the gateway to the long process of rehabilitation; it is certainly not the case that the boys will suddenly be released into the community to fend for themselves or to create havoc. The reality, as Lord Woolf pointed out, is that their lives will never be \"normal\" again, and even if released on licence they will forever live under the shadow of being recalled to prison if they do not abide by the terms of their licence. This case is reminiscent of that of Mary Bell, who killed two children at the age of 11 and was released aged 23. She has apparently made the transition from child-killer to mother.

It expects the contracts will come through during the second half. But it said the complexity of the multi-licence and multi-year deals meant the shortfall was unlikely to be made up. The group said trading in other divisions was faltering. Its battery business had been affected by the delays in the Ministry of Defence's Bowman battlefield radio programme while the performance of its environmental and nuclear technology operations were slightly below forecast. In addition there would be a \u00a32m restructuring cost as a result of a reshaping the intellectual property rights portfolio of the future technologies division \"in preparation for a more creative exploitation of its value\". The division is in effect the group's incubator business. Among its activities is work on lithium ion batteries for applications such as mobile phones. On the upside, a first half improvement by the group's rail services and products operation, which includes signalling technology, is expected to continue into the second half. Sir Tony Cleaver, the chairman, said: \"Since flotation the company's strategy has been to focus the business on those activities which are able to deliver sustained value.\" The board has decided to appoint a chief operating officer with marketing and sales experience as a first step towards realising value from the group's assets and operations. Sir Anthony said there would be other senior appointments.",

What are we to make of this arrival of peace in one place and loss of it in another? The difference between the good and the bad news is not as great as it might seem, and not only because the problems are far from over in the Balkans or because something may be patched up in the Middle East. In the one case, flawed policy just barely achieved a kind of success, and, in the other, flawed policy has led to a tragic failure. The flaws, too, were of a similar order - policy driven by domestic pressures, policy that paid too little attention to the facts on the ground, and policy too wary of difficulties and costs.</p> <p>A decade that began in an atmosphere of great confidence in many countries and across the political spectrum has ended with a sharp reminder of limits and an unmistakable loss of momentum. Remember that good was supposed to build on good. A peace in one place would lead to a peace in another, a successful intervention in one region could be a model for others elsewhere, and the gradual accretion of new international institutions would eventually change the framework in which all societies made their decisions. The hope was for synergy. Failures certainly littered the decade - the Rwandas and Srebrenicas, the downward plunge of the Russian economy, the Asian economic crash, and all the rest of it - but for those keeping score it was possible to feel that the successes were the precedents rather than the other way round.</p> <p>The change now may be a diminishing of that sense that a broad improvement is under way. Consider how attitudes to \"people power\" have shifted. In Serbia and now in the Ivory Coast the removal of a leader who had lost, or never enjoyed, legitimacy may be welcomed - but \"people power\" is not seen as the magic potion that it once seemed to be. Indeed, in the Philippines, one of people power's most striking successes, we may be coming round for a second dose, and, if so, it will be with a certain weariness.</p> <p>The sense of foreboding arises at this moment in part because this decade was Bill Clinton's decade and in part because his presidency is finishing with such a defeat in the Middle East. Clinton's departure will mark the end, if not of an era, at least of a time when the United States had extraordinary opportunities which are unlikely to reoccur. Clinton was a world leader in a way in which neither George Bush or Al Gore can be in the future. This was because America had a capital of influence and power when he took over which is now much drawn down. Much of the world was awed, ready to listen, and, up to a point, ready to be persuaded.</p> <p>But America under Clinton did not use its influence to the full or to the best effect, whether in the Far East, south Asia, Russia, or in the Balkans. Above all, in the Middle East it was by turns serious and timorous in its campaign to isolate and bring down Saddam Hussein and it was slow and often partial in its mediation between Israelis and Palestinians. In the dismal towns of the West Bank and Gaza the bitterness which led to the collapse of the peace process was meanwhile brewing. The daily bombing of Iraq, now an activity entirely divorced from any coherent strategy for dealing with that country, is one index of America's failure. The savage daily encounters between Israeli and Palestinian young men, boys who grew up during these Clinton years, is another. Perhaps American power to change the Middle East was not as great as it seemed. But Clinton was not the man to test it to the limit. His successor will find it hard indeed to mend matters and may not seriously try.</p> <p>If these were the years in which America failed to live up to its potential, that was also true of Europe, which notoriously mishandled the crisis in former Yugoslavia. But America and Europe together did, in the end, adopt policies which halted the Serbian campaign in Bosnia and later forced a withdrawal from Kosovo, which in turn contributed to Milosevic's fall. A new report by an independent international commission charts how Kosovo was allowed to fester to the point where Serbian suppression of rebellion provoked Nato intervention. It allows that this intervention was \"illegal but legitimate\". In its broader conclusions, it states in a measured way the need for early engagement in the kind of situations which could produce violations of human rights on a scale that may later give grounds for a humanitarian military intervention. If, as a last resort, such intervention becomes necessary, it proposes \"a principled framework\" for it, which it would like the United Nations to take up in some way. These are of course sound conclusions, to which a UN secretary general such as Kofi Annan will be sympathetic and some of which he has already anticipated in other reports he has commissioned.</p> <p>What is striking about the Kosovo report, like those others, for all their criticism of the behaviour of governments and international organisations, is their essential optimism. They look to a managed world, in which most disasters are headed off by preventative action, and others are dealt with, when they have to be, by the judicious use of force. But whether the US after Clinton, or a muddled European Union, uncertain of its own course and far from agreed on external policies, are in a position to learn the lessons laid out is another question. In any case, the potentially grave regional crises which the world could face, such as a further breakdown in the Middle East, a confrontation between nuclear armed India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or a clash between China and Taiwan, are of an order in which humanitarian expeditions are irrelevant. It is only in the context of the containment of these larger conflicts that these lesser, internal problems may be amenable to solution.</p> <p>One lesson that has been understood is that such quarrels are more obdurate than is sometimes lightly assumed. Europe's less than inspired efforts to deal with its Balkan problem were, with American help, eventually successful, but only just.

      "bodyText": "At least another 10 people were added to the Ivory Coast's rising death toll yesterday as anti-junta campaigners turned on each other, having driven the military leader, General Robert Guei, from power by a popular revolt. More than 60 people have been killed in three days of protests, and the defence chief of staff said yesterday that anyone breaking the curfew which will be in force until Monday would be shot on sight. In the main city Abidjan, three mosques and a church were ransacked and set alight as supporters of the largely Christian Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) fought with their Muslim rivals, the Rally of the Republicans (RDR), to press home their candidates' claims to the presidency. The electoral commission, which Gen Guei dissolved af ter the results began going against him on Sunday, said yesterday that the FPI leader, Laurent Gbagbo, had won more than 59% of the vote. Gen Guei won about 32% and the turnout was 37%, the commission said. But RDR supporters demanded new elections, on the grounds that their leader, the former prime minister Alassane Outtara, was barred by the supreme court from standing. The latest 10 people killed included a child caught in the crossfire, a policeman, and three RDR activists who were burned alive as the two factions fought with guns and machetes. Yesterday's violence followed a mob attack by Mr Gbagbo's supporters on Mr. Outtara's home. Mr Outtara later took refuge in the German embassy. Soldiers and armed police attacked both sets of protesters, leading observers to wonder which side, if any, the military was on.",

      "bodyText": "On February 15 1989, a fortnight before the Southwood report about BSE was published (Scathing BSE report, October 25), the Guardian printed my letter warning that there was a human risk from this new disease. On the day that report was published (February 27 1989), I appeared on the TV news, warning that the infected tissues of our cattle - the brains - were going into our foods and must immediately be banned. I even uttered the words \"some of us may be incubating it already\". On March 2 1989, the Guardian printed another warning letter from me. And although the Ministry of Agriculture had protected cattle from catching the disease by banning their infective feed in July 1988, they failed to do the same for humans for more than another year - November 9 1989. If the ministry had banned cattle brains from our meat pies at the beginning of 1989, there would have been fewer tragic victims of vCJD. I was a very senior, just retired and therefore independent, neuropathologist. I was familiar with CJD both at the bedside and in the laboratory and had read the all-important scientific work done on the sheep disease, scrapie, which had now got into our cattle. I knew that whereas sheep's brains were left inside the skulls and finished up in cattle rations, cattle brains were always removed in the abattoirs to be added to human foods. They should have listened. Why did they not? Helen Grant London Amid the apologies, I seem to have missed any expression of regret to those honourable scientists who were so shamefully rubbished.
